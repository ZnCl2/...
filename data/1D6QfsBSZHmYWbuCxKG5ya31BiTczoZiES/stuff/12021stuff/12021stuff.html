                    </b>Richie Allen &amp; Dr Vernon Coleman discuss
                    news that the UK government is planning to impose a
                    quarantine on any British citizen who takes a summer
                    holiday this year. Sources indicate that returning
                    holidaymakers will be taken to a hotel by security,
                    where they will have to isolate for between 10 and
                    fourteen days. Dr. Vernon also explains why he
                    doesn't classify the mRNA jabs as actual vaccines
                    and presents evidence that serious adverse events
                    are becoming more and more common. Do visit

                      “Massive &amp; Targeted Reduction of the World
                      Population.”<br>
                      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By Kurt
                      Nimmo<br>
                    </b>Canadian doctor Ghislaine Lanctôt, author of the
                    Medical Mafia, has underscored the lawsuit recently
                    filed by Austrian journalist Jane Bürgermeister
                    against the WHO, the UN, and several high ranking
                    government and corporate officials. Bürgermeister
                    has documented how an international corporate
                    criminal syndicate plans to unleash a deadly flu
                    virus and institute a forced vaccination program.<br>
                    <br>
                    “I am emerging from a long silence on the subject of
                    vaccination, because I feel that, this time, the
                    stakes involved are huge. The consequences may
                    spread much further than anticipated,” writes
                    Lanctôt, who believes the A(H1N1) virus will be used
                    in a pandemic concocted and orchestrated by the WHO,
                    an international organization that serves military,
                    political and industrial interests.<br>
                    <br>
                    Lanctôt warns that the elite and their minions will
                    introduce a compulsory vaccination that will contain
                    a deadly virus and this will be used specifically as
                    a eugenics weapon for “massive and targeted
                    reduction of the world population.” Moreover, a
                    pandemic will also be used to further establish
                    martial law and a police state, according to
                    Lanctôt, and activate concentration camps “built to
                    accommodate the rebellious” and eventually transfer
                    power from all nations to a single United Nations
                    government and thus fulfill the sinister plans of
                    the New World Order.<br>

                    "...It is possible to envision hybrid
                    aerospace-undersea craft (HAUC), which can function
                    as a submersible craft capable of extreme underwater
                    speeds (lack of water-skin friction) and enhanced
                    aerial/underwater stealth capabilities (non-linear
                    scattering of RF and sonar signals). This hybrid
                    craft would move with great ease through the
                    air/space/water mediums, by being enclosed in a
                    Vacuum/plasma bubble/sheath, due to the coupled
                    effects of EM field-induced air/water particles
                    repulsion and Vacuum energy polarization. ..."<br>

                    </b>The present invention is a room temperature
                    superconductor comprising of a wire, which comprises
                    of an insulator core and a metal coating. The metal
                    coating is disposed around the insulator core, and
                    the metal is coating deposited on the core. When a
                    pulsed current is passed through the wire, while the
                    wire is vibrated, room temperature superconductivity
                    is induced.<br>

                      suffering from 'maskitis'? A-list skincare expert
                      warns of painful, flaky rash caused by face masks
                      that is often confused with maskne - and can
                      spread quickly if left untreated</b><br>
                    Dr. Dennis Gross, who counts the likes of Zoe
                    Kravitz and Selena Gomez among his clients, said
                    many people who think they have maskne actually have
                    maskitis <br>
                    Maskne is blemishes caused by the friction of the
                    mask against the skin, and the humidity caused by
                    the face covering <br>
                    According to the board-certified dermatologist,
                    maskitis is 'marked by small bumps, redness,
                    inflammation and dry, flaky skin'<br>
                    Treatments for the two conditions are very
                    different, Dr. Gross explained<br>

                    Griffin provides details on the mysterious and
                    infamous "They," the Secret Societies, the
                    puppet-masters behind the scenes who control the
                    governments of the world through carefully
                    constructed "Rings of Power." These power groups
                    maintain generational plans for the implementation
                    of a world wide communistic government, ushering in
                    a New World Order. Griffin notes that this single

                    Yuri Bezmenov details the process of how a
                    non-communist country is converted into communism
                    through the 4 stages of ideological subversion. Once
                    Ideological Subversion is in focus, we can see
                    clearly how the entire world is being duped to
                    accept this long standing communistic world
                    government agenda enforced by governments on behalf
                    of the "Rings of Power." Together, Griffin and
                    Bezmenov provide key insights into how the "they"
                    subvert the world under their control, from behind
                    the scenes, but in plain sight. <br>

                    and many tons of petrol were produced. These

                    Researchers have developed a rejuvenating gene
                    therapy for human skin that has the potential to
                    make “ageing a reversible phenomenon.” RT spoke to
                    the lead scientist, Professor Kwang-Hyun Cho, about
                    the astonishing breakthrough.<br>
                    Scientists at the Korea Advanced Institute of
                    Science and Technology (KAIST) have discovered a way
                    to make skin cells “grow younger.” They claim the
                    original technique can be used to “reverse the
                    ageing process and prevent diseases related to
                    ageing and prolong life span.” <br>
                    Speaking to RT from KAIST University, Professor
                    Kwang-Hyun Cho, the lead scientist in the study,
                    said&nbsp; seeing the revitalized skin in the
                    laboratory was “dramatic,” and added that the newly
                    discovered technique “applies not only to human skin
                    but also to our whole body.” <br>
                    Professor Cho described his newly developed
                    technique as “opening the door for a new generation
                    that perceives ageing as a reversible biological
                    phenomenon.” It relies on using chemical inhibition
                    and gene interference to “switch off” a molecule
                    that makes cells grow old. The ageing of a cell is
                    called cell senescence. The researchers were able to
                    “reawaken” skin cells in the lab and rejuvenate
                    their ability to repair and divide into newer
                    versions of themselves. <br>
                    The results showed that the overall functionality of
                    skin tissue was regenerated, giving the skin a
                    healthy amount of collagen and elastic fibers,
                    ridding the tissue of wrinkles. The promise of the
                    technique could see an end to the ravages of age
                    like dryness, creases, loss of elasticity and
                    thinning skin...<br>

                    </b><b>Significance</b><br>
                    Recent studies showed that cellular senescence,
                    previously considered an irreversible biological
                    phenomenon, may represent a reversible state, but
                    the mechanism for the reversion is not well
                    elucidated. To identify targets the inhibition of
                    which would convert senescent cells into quiescent
                    cells, we constructed a molecular regulatory network
                    model of cellular senescence. From the model
                    simulation, we identified PDK1 as a promising target
                    that can revert the senescent state into a quiescent
                    state. We validated this prediction in experiments
                    with human dermal fibroblasts, which showed that
                    PDK1 inhibition eradicates senescence hallmarks by
                    suppressing both nuclear factor κB and mTOR
                    signaling through the inactivation of a positive
                    feedback loop composed of PDK1, AKT, IKBKB, and
                    PTEN, resulting in restored skin regeneration
                    capacity.<br>
                    <b>Abstract</b><br>
                    Cellular senescence is defined as a stable,
                    persistent arrest of cell proliferation. Here, we
                    examine whether senescent cells can lose senescence
                    hallmarks and reenter a reversible state of
                    cell-cycle arrest (quiescence). We constructed a
                    molecular regulatory network of cellular senescence
                    based on previous experimental evidence. To infer
                    the regulatory logic of the network, we performed
                    phosphoprotein array experiments with normal human
                    dermal fibroblasts and used the data to optimize the
                    regulatory relationships between molecules with an
                    evolutionary algorithm. From ensemble analysis of
                    network models, we identified
                    3-phosphoinositide–dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK1)
                    as a promising target for inhibitors to convert the
                    senescent state to the quiescent state. We showed
                    that inhibition of PDK1 in senescent human dermal
                    fibroblasts eradicates senescence hallmarks and
                    restores entry into the cell cycle by suppressing
                    both nuclear factor κB and mTOR signaling, resulting
                    in restored skin regeneration capacity. Our findings
                    provide insight into a potential therapeutic
                    strategy to treat age-related diseases associated
                    with the accumulation of senescent cells.<br>

                    </b><b>Abstract</b><br>
                    The present invention relates to a method for
                    inducing reverse senescence by using a specific
                    molecular target to restore aged cells to a young
                    cell state. Particularly, the present invention
                    relates to a composition for inducing reverse
                    senescence including a PDK1
                    (Phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1) inhibitor or a
                    method for inducing reverse senescence including a
                    step of treating aged cells with a PDK1
                    (Phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1) inhibitor.
                    According to the present invention, PDK1 is a
                    protein that simultaneously controls MTOR and NF-κB
                    among the main signal transferring proteins
                    participating in cell senescence, and is a key
                    protein determining cell growth-, division- and
                    senescence-associated secretary phenotypes. It is
                    determined that when PDK1 is inhibited temporarily,
                    a part of aged cells is effectively restored to
                    normal young cells and no phenotypes of aged cells
                    are observed in such cells. Therefore, PDK1 suggests
                    a new possibility to the current senescence
                    treatment strategy focused on inducing apoptosis of
                    aged cells, and can be used advantageously for
                    development of anti- senescence materials and agents
                    for treating senescence-associated diseases.<br>

                      Steve Hilton finds stunning Covid 19 connections:
                      ‘Specific activity that Dr. Fauci funded and it is
                      terrifying’</b><b><br>
                    </b>Fox News’ Steve Hilton shared an investigation
                    that breaks down the origins of the coronavirus, and
                    not only links it back to U.S. commissioned
                    research, but also to Dr. Anthony Fauci.<br>
                    The host of the “The Next Revolution” told his
                    viewers that the evidence uncovered “points to the
                    most likely cause of the pandemic and it’s worse
                    than anything that we have heard so far.”<br>
                    Highlighting a study 10 years ago in the Netherlands
                    involving ferrets, which have respiratory systems
                    that operate similar to humans, Hilton said
                    researchers “were trying to see if the virus that
                    starts out without the ability to be transmitted
                    through the air can eventually gain that ability.”<br>
                    “This led to the creation of an entirely new type of
                    scientific research made possible by advances in
                    gene technology,” he said. “It was called gain of
                    function virus research. The idea was to replicate
                    in a lab what had been done with those ferrets — to
                    take the virus and manipulate the genetic code to
                    make it stronger and powerful. The virus would gain
                    new function, hence the name.”<br>
                    The idea being to engineer the most contagious
                    deadly viruses in lab conditions “to learn about
                    treatments and vaccines about the calamity of an
                    actual outbreak,” Hilton noted.<br>
                    This research was carried out around the world, with
                    Wuhan, China being home to a leading laboratory,
                    funded in part by the National Institute of Allergy
                    and Infectious Diseases, headed up by Dr. Anthony
                    Fauci...<br>
                    “Despite the controversy surrounding this type of
                    research,” he said, “it always had one steadfast
                    champion, a leading figure in the world of
                    infectious diseases, Anthony Fauci. His institute
                    funded that first ferret study. At the time he
                    cowrote an op-ed in the Washington Post describing
                    the research as “a risk worth taking… important
                    information and insight can come from generating a
                    potentially dangerous virus in the laboratory.”<br>
                    “Shortly before the Obama Administration’s ban on
                    gain of function research in 2014, Dr. Fauci
                    commissioned … a project to assess the risk of new
                    coronaviruses emerging from wild animals like bats —
                    one of the aims was to see what viruses can infect
                    animals and humans,” Hilton said.<br>
                    The Fox News host said that while the Obama
                    administration stopped the research, Fauci
                    “continued on by subcontracting it” to the NY based
                    EcoHealth Alliance.<br>
                    Sharing what he called a “crucial step that have
                    never been reported,” Hilton noted that EcoHealth
                    Alliance then subcontracted the gain of function
                    piece to the Wuhan Institute of Virology...<br>

                    </b>From nurturing living organisms to feeding
                    billions of people, the transformation of
                    atmospheric nitrogen to ammonia (NH3) is essential
                    to sustain life on earth. In nature, bacteria and
                    plants can produce ammonia from air and water at
                    ambient conditions via nitrogen fixation processes.
                    To follow this feat, we couple plasma-driven
                    nitrogen oxides intermediary (NOx) generation and
                    their electrocatalytic reduction to pave the way for
                    scalable green ammonia at ambient conditions. We
                    developed a plasma bubble column reactor that brings
                    together dual reactor configuration with multiple
                    discharge schemes and bubble dynamic control to
                    generate NOx intermediaries at low specific energy
                    consumption of 3.8 kWh/mol. The NOx intermediaries
                    were converted to ammonia at a rate of 23.2 mg/h
                    (42.1 nmol/cm2s), using a scalable electrolyzer
                    operating at a low cell voltage of 1.4 V, current
                    densities of over 50 mA/cm2, and specific energy
                    consumption of 0.51 kWh/mol NH3.<br>

                    </b><br>
                    The Coming War on China (2016) is John Pilger's 60th
                    film for ITV. Pilger reveals what the news doesn't -
                    that the world's greatest military power, the United
                    States, and the world's second economic power,
                    China, both nuclear-armed, are on the road to war.
                    The film is a warning and an inspiring story of
                    resistance.<br>

                    </b><b>Abstract</b><b><br>
                    </b>Auditory steady-state response (ASSR) at 40Hz
                    has been proposed as a potential biomarker for
                    schizophrenia. The ASSR studies in patients have
                    used click stimulation or amplitude-modulated tones.
                    However, the sensitivity of 40Hz ASSRs to different
                    stimulation types in the same group of patients has
                    not been previously evaluated. Two stimulation types
                    for ASSRs were tested in this study: (1) 40Hz clicks
                    and (2) flutter-amplitude modulated tones. The mean
                    phase-locking index, evoked amplitude and
                    event-related spectral perturbation values were
                    compared between schizophrenia patients (n=26) and
                    healthy controls (n=20). Both stimulation types
                    resulted in the observation of impaired
                    phase-locking and power measures of late (200-500ms)
                    40Hz ASSR in patients compared to healthy controls.
                    The early-latency (0-100ms) 40Hz ASSR part was
                    diminished in the schizophrenia group in response to
                    clicks only. The late-latency 40Hz ASSR parameters
                    obtained through different stimulation types
                    correlated in healthy subjects but not in patients.
                    We conclude that flutter amplitude-modulated tone
                    stimulation, due to its potential to reveal
                    late-latency entrainment deficits, is suitable for
                    use in clinical populations. Careful consideration
                    of experimental stimulation settings can contribute
                    to the interpretation of ASSR deficits and
                    utilization as a potential biomarker.<br>

                    </b><b>...The science so far</b><b><br>
                    </b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It has been known since at
                    least the 1980s that cognitive activity triggers
                    brainwaves (wave-like patterns of activation) at a
                    frequency of 40 Hz in humans and other mammals.<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1991, researchers from the NYU
                    Medical Center discovered that Alzheimer’s patients
                    have reduced 40 Hz brainwaves compared with healthy
                    people. (paywalled paper)<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 2016, MIT’s Alzheimer’s group
                    did experiments on transgenic mice with early
                    Alzheimer’s disease and found that exposing them to
                    a light flickering at a frequency of 40 Hz (40 times
                    a second) for 1 hour a day for 7 days causes an
                    almost 60% reduction in β-amyloid plaques, which are
                    a molecular hallmark of Alzheimer’s. Flickering at
                    20 Hz and 80 Hz did not have the same effect. An
                    important qualification here is that the effect was
                    limited to the visual cortex, which is not
                    significantly affected in human Alzheimer’s
                    patients. Here’s an accessibly written report in The
                    Atlantic and here’s the original paper (published in
                    Nature) if you’re strong in science-speak. MIT also
                    made a video about the findings.<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In March 2016, scientists at the
                    University of Toronto published the results of a
                    small, placebo-controlled pilot study (paywalled
                    paper), in which they exposed 20 Alzheimer’s
                    patients to a 40 Hz sound. After six 30-minute
                    sessios (done twice a week), the patients’ average
                    score on the 30-point SLUMS scale improved by 4
                    points, while the placebo group did not improve. It
                    should be noted that the “dosage” of the treatment
                    was rather low, which may explain the modest
                    results.<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In January 2017, Cognito
                    Therapeutics, a company formed by some of the
                    members of the MIT team, started conducting
                    preliminary trials to assess the safety of exposing
                    AD patients to simultaneous flickering lights, an
                    audio tone, and vibrations – all at 40 hertz...<br>
                    In January 2018, the New Scientist reported
                    (paywalled article) that the same MIT team achieved
                    even better results by playing mice a 40 Hz sound.
                    β-amyloid plaques shrank by about 50% in the
                    auditory cortex and – crucially – in the
                    hippocampus, perhaps because the two areas are close
                    to each other. This would be a very important
                    discovery, because the hippocampus is the region of
                    the brain which is involved in forming memories. It
                    is the hippocampus that suffers the most damage in
                    human Alzheimer’s patients. According to the
                    magazine, these results were presented at the
                    Society for Neuroscience conference in Washington in
                    November 2017. However, the published paper
                    described a significantly different protocol (see
                    below), so it is likely that the New Scientist
                    didn’t get the details right.<br>
                    In July 2018, the International Journal of
                    Alzheimer’s Disease published the results of a pilot
                    study in which 6 human patients were exposed to a
                    40-hertz flickering light bulb for 2 hours a day for
                    10 days. The therapy was administered in a home
                    setting by the patients’ caregivers. No difference
                    in β-amyloid plaque was found after therapy. If
                    there was an effect, it must have been smaller than
                    20%, which is not comparable to the 50% reduction
                    seen in mice.<br>
                    In March 2019, Cell published another (paywalled)
                    paper about another study done by the MIT group.
                    Here’s a NYT article about it. Here are the main
                    points:<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After mice were exposed (for 7
                    days, 1 hour a day) to a series of clicks repeating
                    at a frequency of 40 Hz, the amount of amyloid
                    plaque in their auditory cortex and their
                    hippocampus was reduced by about 40%. The mice also
                    did better on several tasks involving the use of
                    memory.<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The clicks were 10 kHz waves, 1
                    millisecond long, repeated 40 times a second (each
                    cycle had a 1 ms tone followed by 24 ms of silence).
                    In communication with me, one of the paper’s authors
                    said that pure 40 Hz tones were not used because
                    mice cannot hear tones of such a low frequency.<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When this auditory treatment was
                    combined with light pulses at 40 Hz, microglia
                    (“brain cleaner cells”) started clustering around
                    amyloid plaque, and the reductions in plaque
                    extended to parts of the prefrontal cortex (an area
                    related to functions like attention and short-term
                    memory). This effect was not observed with either
                    audio or light treatment alone.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>(Don’t) try this at home</b><b><br>
                    </b>If you want to try some kind of do-it-yourself
                    auditory therapy, it’s not clear what kind of tones
                    you should use. Dennis, the reader from the UK who
                    piqued my interest in this subject, used a pure 40
                    Hz tone. According to this AlterNet article (later
                    reprinted by The Salon), a pure tone was used in the
                    preliminary safety study done by Cognito in early
                    2017. On the other hand, it appears that the most
                    recently published MIT study used series of clicks
                    (despite previous reports) rather than a tone. The
                    New York Times quotes Dr. Tsai, who worked on that
                    study, as saying “your brain seems to be able to
                    perceive clicks more than a tone”, which would seem
                    to indicate a preference that’s not exclusive to
                    mice.<br>
                    <br>
                    However, in response to my inquiry, another
                    co-author of the paper, Ho-Jun Suk, said that 40 Hz
                    pure tones were not used because mice cannot hear
                    tones of such a low frequency. It would be very
                    interesting to know what sort of tones are being
                    used in the now ongoing human trials. (If you are in
                    the trials or know anyone who’s in them, please let
                    everyone know in the comments section.)<br>
                    <br>
                    The New York Times and the Boston Globe published
                    articles about the MIT mice study, including links
                    to audio samples of the stimuli that were used by
                    the researchers. Unfortunately, I have discovered
                    that neither sample represents accurately the audio
                    waves that were played to the mice. The clicks in
                    the published samples are smeared in time (closer to
                    2 ms) and are not pure 10 kHz tones. Ho-Jun Suk has
                    confirmed that they do not match the source signal.
                    (I don’t know how the NYT and Boston Globe managed
                    to mangle the files so badly, but it’s not because
                    of compression – I tried it on the same encoder and
                    the same parameters that were used by the NYT and it
                    did not distort the signal very much at all.)<br>
                    <br>
                    If you are thinking about using clicks rather than
                    pure tones, I would not recommend using 10 kHz
                    clicks because human ears are not very sensitive to
                    that range of the spectrum. Something like 3 kHz
                    (where human hearing works the best) would probably
                    be more sensible...<br>

                    day, she placed them in a box lit only by a
                    flickering strobe. The mice — which had been
                    engineered to produce plaques of the peptide
                    amyloid-β in the brain, a hallmark of Alzheimer’s
                    disease — crawled about curiously. When Tsai later
                    dissected them, those that had been to the mini
                    dance parties had significantly lower levels of
                    plaque than mice that had spent the same time in the
                    dark1.<br>
                    <br>
                    Tsai, a neuroscientist at Massachusetts Institute of
                    Technology (MIT) in Cambridge, says she checked the
                    result; then checked it again. “For the longest
                    time, I didn’t believe it,” she says. Her team had
                    managed to clear amyloid from part of the brain with
                    a flickering light. The strobe was tuned to 40 hertz
                    and was designed to manipulate the rodents’
                    brainwaves, triggering a host of biological effects
                    that eliminated the plaque-forming proteins.
                    Although promising findings in mouse models of
                    Alzheimer’s disease have been notoriously difficult
                    to replicate in humans, the experiment offered some
                    tantalizing possibilities. “The result was so
                    mind-boggling and so robust, it took a while for the
                    idea to sink in, but we knew we needed to work out a
                    way of trying out the same thing in humans,” Tsai
                    says...<br>

                    </b>On June 22-23, 2001, the Center for Strategic
                    and International Studies, the Johns Hopkins Center
                    for Civilian Biodefense Studies, the ANSER Institute

                    National Memorial Institute for the Prevention
                    Terrorism, hosted a senior-level war game examining
                    the national security, intergovernmental, and
                    information challenges of a biological attack on the
                    American homeland. (See also: Dark Winter Script •

                    With tensions rising in the Taiwan Straits, and a
                    major crisis developing in Southwest Asia, a
                    smallpox outbreak was confirmed by the CDC in
                    Oklahoma City. During the thirteen days of the game,
                    the disease spread to 25 states and 15 other
                    countries. Fourteen participants and 60 observers
                    witnessed terrorism/warfare in slow motion.
                    Discussions, debates (some rather heated), and
                    decisions focused on the public health response,
                    lack of an adequate supply of smallpox vaccine,
                    roles and missions of federal and state governments,
                    civil liberties associated with quarantine and
                    isolation, the role of DoD, and potential military
                    responses to the anonymous attack. Additionally, a
                    predictable 24/7 news cycle quickly developed that
                    focused the nation and the world on the attack and
                    response. Five representatives from the national
                    press corps (including print and broadcast)
                    participated in the game and conducted a lengthy

                      Correlations between Sharia Adherence and Violent
                      Dogma in U.S. Mosques<br>
                      ABSTRACT</b><br>
                    A random survey of 100 representative mosques in the
                    U.S. was conducted to measure the correlation
                    between Sharia adherence and dogma calling for
                    violence against non-believers.&nbsp; Of the 100
                    mosques surveyed, 51% had texts on site rated as
                    severely advocating violence; 30% had texts rated as
                    moderately advocating violence; and 19% had no
                    violent texts at all.&nbsp; Mosques that presented
                    as Sharia adherent were more likely to feature
                    violence-positive texts on site than were their
                    non-Sharia-adherent counterparts.&nbsp; In 84.5% of
                    the mosques, the imam recommended studying
                    violence-positive texts.&nbsp; The leadership at
                    Sharia-adherent mosques was more likely to recommend
                    that a worshiper study violence-positive texts than
                    leadership at non-Sharia-adherent mosques.&nbsp;
                    Fifty-eight percent of the mosques invited guest
                    imams known to promote violent jihad.&nbsp; The
                    leadership of mosques that featured
                    violence-positive literature was more likely to
                    invite guest imams who were known to promote violent
                    jihad than was the leadership of mosques that did
                    not feature violence-positive literature on mosque
                    premises.<br>

                    </b>The Coming War on China (2016) is John Pilger's
                    60th film for ITV. Pilger reveals what the news
                    doesn't - that the world's greatest military power,
                    the United States, and the world's second economic
                    power, China, both nuclear-armed, are on the road to
                    war. The film is a warning and an inspiring story of
                    resistance.<br>

                      Abstract<br>
                    </b>Auditory steady-state response (ASSR) at 40Hz
                    has been proposed as a potential biomarker for
                    schizophrenia. The ASSR studies in patients have
                    used click stimulation or amplitude-modulated tones.
                    However, the sensitivity of 40Hz ASSRs to different
                    stimulation types in the same group of patients has
                    not been previously evaluated. Two stimulation types
                    for ASSRs were tested in this study: (1) 40Hz clicks
                    and (2) flutter-amplitude modulated tones. The mean
                    phase-locking index, evoked amplitude and
                    event-related spectral perturbation values were
                    compared between schizophrenia patients (n=26) and
                    healthy controls (n=20). Both stimulation types
                    resulted in the observation of impaired
                    phase-locking and power measures of late (200-500ms)
                    40Hz ASSR in patients compared to healthy controls.
                    The early-latency (0-100ms) 40Hz ASSR part was
                    diminished in the schizophrenia group in response to
                    clicks only. The late-latency 40Hz ASSR parameters
                    obtained through different stimulation types
                    correlated in healthy subjects but not in patients.
                    We conclude that flutter amplitude-modulated tone
                    stimulation, due to its potential to reveal
                    late-latency entrainment deficits, is suitable for
                    use in clinical populations. Careful consideration
                    of experimental stimulation settings can contribute
                    to the interpretation of ASSR deficits and
                    utilization as a potential biomarker.<br>

                    The question of the intelligence of a certain
                    nationality or population may be controversial. In
                    fact, intelligence is influenced by national,
                    political, and geographic factors. Often
                    surprisingly, but scientifically proven, a warmer
                    climate has a markedly bad influence on the
                    intelligence quotient. With an average IQ of 98
                    points, the USA ranks 27th in this ranking. With 108
                    points, the inhabitants of Singapore reach the
                    highest intelligence quotas worldwide. The last
                    place with only 56 points is occupied by Equatorial
                    Guinea. The displayed IQ was averaged out of the
                    results of 9 international studies and compared to
                    the average income and government expenditures on

                      Doctor Reveals the Corona Effect – Claims COVID is
                      Blood Coagulation</b><b> -- By Makia Freeman</b><br>
                    AT A GLANCE... THE STORY: What if COVID has nothing
                    at all to do with a virus? THE IMPLICATIONS: Has
                    this fake pandemic capitalized on people's ignorance
                    of the true nature of acidosis, disease, viruses and
                    terrain theory?<br>
                    ...Young exposes how polio was not cause by a virus,
                    despite popular belief, but was actually caused by
                    poisoning from the pesticide DDT. Remember too that
                    the cancer-causing monkey virus SV-40 (Simian Virus
                    40) was found in all polio vaccines administered to
                    Americans up until around 1963. Young writes:<br>
                    ...“I am suggesting in this article that there are
                    significant findings based on historical and past
                    and current research, including my own research that
                    the theory of Polio and possibly other modern-day
                    diseases, such as Post-Polio Syndrome, Polio
                    Vaccine-Induced Paralysis, Legionnaires, CNS
                    disease, Cancer and AIDS may be caused by acidic
                    chemical poisoning from DDT
                    (dichloro-diphenyl-trichloroethane) and other
                    related DDT pesticides, acidic vaccinations, and
                    other factors including lifestyle and dietary
                    factors rather than from a lone infectious
                    Poliovirus.”<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Farr’s Law requires, for an
                    epidemic to be a valid example of contagion, that
                    the epidemic increase its incidence rates
                    exponentially. Since polio has been ubiquitous since
                    the beginning of human history, its incidence rate
                    should have peaked long ago and universal immunity
                    conferred, if immunity was ever required, and if the
                    poliovirus was actually a predator.”<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “The non-funded, ostracized
                    theory of poison causality far exceeds all other
                    theories in simplicity, exactitude, and directness
                    regarding correlations within all data areas:
                    dosage, physiology, etiology, epidemiology,
                    economics, and politics.”...<br>

                      Siege 2021</b><br>
                    Ashli Babbit's real name is Ashley Nylen. She and
                    her husband are both government employees. See our
                    previous videos for more details on this. Through
                    close relative Jesper Nylen, Ashli is connected to a
                    British military supply firm. This makes it appear
                    that there are at least TWO military firms involved
                    in the 2020 vote fraud crimes, and then the
                    subsequent staged distraction / coverup of the D.C
                    staged "Capitol siege." The other military
                    contractor is Leonardo SpA, from which the commands
                    were sent to the DOMINION voting machines, in order
                    to "adjust" the vote count for Biden.<br>

                    little-known, self-funded Australian technology
                    company with a prestigious Global Energy Award for
                    " its development of a hydrogen demand
                    activator. Star Scientific chairman Andrew Horvath
                    reveals how his company is making its market on the
                    world stage …<br>
                    That was three years ago. Now Star Scientific has
                    HERO, a coating, a substance that is distributed
                    across a substrate, such as ceramic or certain
                    metals, and “when it comes into contact with
                    hydrogen and oxygen, it goes from zero to over 700
                    degrees Celsius in three minutes,” says Horvath.<br>
                    “Because it’s not burning, it’s a reaction, all that
                    energy is excitement energy and it goes straight
                    through the substrate. So our energy transfer is
                    above 90% into whatever you’re transferring it to,
                    whether it’s water, CO2, whatever medium.”<br>

                      Vaccine - a cure worse than the disease - Part 29
                      -- By Yoichi Shimatsu</b><br>
                    Being on the road for field research toward rolling
                    back the cultural genocide of American society by
                    politically correct fanatics, this part 29 of my
                    coronavirus-biowarfare series has to be shorter than
                    the usual in-depth essay indicting the medical
                    sector, pharmaceuticals and murderous bureaucrat
                    biowarriors.<br>
                    To put the present situation mildly, the vaccine is
                    worse than a failure and, intended or not,
                    tantamount to yet another stab at mass murder. The
                    panic about contracting this "fatal" infection has
                    been grossly overblown with wild-eyed claims of 30
                    percent of Americans being infected, as claimed by
                    the CDC. Yet only 10 percent of the population
                    carries the antibodies, which indicates a difference
                    of 20 percent of the population, who therefore
                    should therefore be dead by now, according to the
                    CDC equation.<br>
                    The unending official panic,besides being a Democrat
                    ploy to steal the election, has led to another turn
                    for the worse, which is to attach a detonator fuse,
                    so to speak, to the COVID bomb. As discussed further
                    on, the messenger RNA vaccine being pushed by Pfizer
                    is frightening the human immune system into
                    overreaction, thereby heightening the pain of once
                    mild symptoms and, in some unreported cases, killing
                    the unsuspecting patient.<br>
                    As discussed extensively in this series, COVID-19 is
                    a biological weapon spliced with gene sequences from
                    HIV and bovine tuberculosis, which are both highly
                    threatening to the human immune system.<br>
                    The messaging RNA vaccine is being tested on nearly
                    2 million guinea pigs. At last count the vaxx has
                    triggered, or to be precise rekindled adverse
                    reactions in more than 4,000 healthy individuals
                    (who probably had mild COVID infections earlier).<br>
                    Covering the tracks of pharma Pfizer, the FDA's
                    Center for Biologics Evaluation suggests that these
                    painful reactions ranging from throbbing pain to
                    life-threatening inflammation are due to its solvent
                    polyethylene glycol (PEG)., which causes known side
                    effects of bloating, diarrhea, nausea, cramps, gas
                    and hives. That assessment is sheer nonsense, since
                    patients undergoing bowel surgery are flushed and
                    flooded with that substance as a tissue softener,
                    whereas the intravenous dosage in the vaccine is
                    minuscule by comparison. Any medical authority
                    spouting such nonsense is guilty of premeditate
                    diarrhea of the mouth.<br>
                    That grease cannot possibly account for the recent
                    death of a Florida physician, who showed the
                    symptoms uncannily similar to COVID infections in
                    children. These include heart palpitation, a low
                    platelet county and small red spots on the skin,
                    which are caused by ruptures of small blood vessels.
                    Just two weeks after receiving the vaccine, the
                    otherwise healthy 56 year-old Miami Beach
                    obstetrician died of a massive hemorrhagic stroke
                    two<br>
                    A majority of COVID vaccine sufferers have not had a
                    prior history of allergenic reactions or anaphylaxis
                    involving injections, which indicates something else
                    is happening to their immune systems. What is
                    happening in patients is toxic shock, the human
                    immune system going berserk out of fear of viral
                    invasion and shutting down the central nervous
                    system. We are dying from existential fear of the
                    invaders, so remember that old adage "we have met
                    the enemy and it is us".<br>
                    The Pfizer strategy is fundamentally wrong in
                    mimicking the spike protein of the COVID antigen,
                    which has the ability to tag the antibodies emitted
                    from white blood corpuscles. People who have been
                    mildly exposed to COVID will overreact to the
                    presence of a spike protein. This is because the
                    bovine tuberculosis strand attached to the COVID
                    bioweapon has already "turned" antibodies into
                    appearing to be attackers or antigens, to deceive
                    the human immune system into the false perception of
                    an all-out invasion, resulting in a panicked
                    cytokyne storm that causes bio-system collapse in
                    the patient.<br>
                    In short, if you'd already had a mild brush with
                    COVID, your immune system is likely to overreact to
                    the monoclonal RNA vaccine. This explains the fever,
                    bowel movement, palpitations and blood vessel
                    ruptures as symptoms triggered by the vaccine inside
                    a partially infected person, who otherwise should
                    have survived COVID in good condition.<br>
                    The far worse contagion than coronavirus, pandemic
                    which lasted less than 6 months in Hong Kong in
                    2003, is murderous criminality of the Democrat
                    leadership, which evaded gain of function limits on
                    biowar research, and the profiteering by unethical
                    pharma executives and their institutional investors
                    aka the insurance industry. .<br>
                    Pfizer disclaims responsibility, which is the green
                    light for law firms to start organizing class-action
                    litigation for pharmacological malpractice. Notably,
                    taxpayers need not feel any guilt in this case since
                    Pfizer developed the monoclonal RNA product outside
                    of the Trump admin's fast-track therapy project
                    called Operation Warp Speed. A known supplier of
                    kickbacks to drug pushers known as doctors, Pfizer
                    is a repeat offender, now and then with its reckless
                    Lipitor blood thinner and the 2.3 billion dollar
                    fine in 2009 for its Bextra painkiller. Their new
                    vaccine is extending the COVID crisis by deranging
                    the immune system and needless suffering for
                    patients who were already self-cured thanks to the
                    natural defenses of their bodies. . Neglect of one's
                    health results in bad medicine, so take good care of
                    your body and mind the natural way.<br>

                      Power: Hemp Batteries Better Than Lithium And
                      Graphene -- By Barnaby De Hoedt<br>
                    </b>Henry Ford’s Model T was famously made partly
                    from hemp bioplastic and powered by hemp biofuel.
                    Now, with battery-powered vehicles starting to
                    replace those that use combustion engines, it has
                    been found that hemp batteries perform eight times
                    better than lithium-ion. Is there anything that this
                    criminally-underused plant can’t do?<br>
                    The comparison has only been proven on a very small
                    scale. (You weren’t expecting a Silicon Valley
                    conglomerate to do something genuinely
                    groundbreaking were you? They mainly just
                    commercialise stuff that’s been invented or at least
                    funded by the state.) But the results are extremely
                    promising.<br>
                    The experiment was conducted by Robert Murray Smith
                    – who has built up quite a following on his YouTube
                    channel – of FWG Ltd in Kent. He observed a Volts by
                    Amps curve of both the hemp and lithium batteries
                    and found that the power underneath the hemp cell
                    was a value of 31 while that of the lithium cell had
                    a value of just 4. Although he does not claim to
                    have proven anything, he said that the results of
                    his experiment showed that the performance of the
                    hemp cell is “significantly better” than the lithium
                    cell.<br>
                    It comes as no real surprise, which is presumably
                    why he conducted the experiment. In 2014, scientists
                    in the US found that waste fibres – ‘shiv’ – from
                    hemp crops can be transformed into “ultrafast”
                    supercapacitors that are “better than graphene”.
                    Graphene is a synthetic carbon material lighter than
                    foil yet bulletproof, but it is prohibitively
                    expensive to make. The hemp version isn’t just
                    better, it costs one-thousandth of the price.<br>

                      Abstract<br>
                    </b>We created unique interconnected partially
                    graphitic carbon nanosheets (10–30 nm in thickness)
                    with high specific surface area (up to 2287 m2 g–1),
                    significant volume fraction of mesoporosity (up to
                    58%), and good electrical conductivity (211–226 S
                    m–1) from hemp bast fiber. The nanosheets are
                    ideally suited for low (down to 0 °C) through high
                    (100 °C) temperature ionic-liquid-based
                    supercapacitor applications: At 0 °C and a current
                    density of 10 A g–1, the electrode maintains a
                    remarkable capacitance of 106 F g–1. At 20, 60, and
                    100 °C and an extreme current density of 100 A g–1,
                    there is excellent capacitance retention (72–92%)
                    with the specific capacitances being 113, 144, and
                    142 F g–1, respectively. These characteristics
                    favorably place the materials on a Ragone chart
                    providing among the best power–energy
                    characteristics (on an active mass normalized basis)
                    ever reported for an electrochemical capacitor: At a
                    very high power density of 20 kW kg–1 and 20, 60,
                    and 100 °C, the energy densities are 19, 34, and 40
                    Wh kg–1, respectively. Moreover the assembled
                    supercapacitor device yields a maximum energy
                    density of 12 Wh kg–1, which is higher than that of
                    commercially available supercapacitors. By taking
                    advantage of the complex multilayered structure of a
                    hemp bast fiber precursor, such exquisite carbons
                    were able to be achieved by simple hydrothermal
                    carbonization combined with activation. This novel
                    precursor-synthesis route presents a great potential
                    for facile large-scale production of
                    high-performance carbons for a variety of diverse
                    applications including energy storage.<br>

                      Supercapacitors<br>
                      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chao Dang,
                      et al.<br>
                      Abstract<br>
                    </b>Using the disulfide bond and carboxyl group in
                    the molecular structure, α-lipoic acid was easily
                    dissolved in the NaOH/urea solution and could be
                    used as a ternary solvent for dissolving cellulose.
                    Through this platform, N, S dual-doped hierarchical
                    porous carbon aerogels (NSHPAs) were successfully
                    obtained via directly dissolving cellulose in this
                    ternary solvent, followed by gelling and
                    carbonization. Because the fabricated carbon
                    materials had a proper structure and a uniform
                    heteroatom doping, their capacitance could reach 329
                    F g–1 at 0.5 A g–1, 1647.5 mF cm–2 at 2.5 mA cm–2,
                    and the fine rate property was 215 F g–1 at 10 A g–1
                    and 1075 mF cm–2 at 50 mA cm–2, respectively.
                    Additionally, the electric double-layer contribution
                    and pseudocapacitance contribution from the N,S dual
                    doping were also analyzed. Meanwhile, they showed
                    outstanding capacitance retention in a 2 M H2SO4
                    electrolyte. Additionally, a symmetric
                    supercapacitor (SSC) was assembled by NSHPAs, and
                    yielded a high specific capacitance of 63.6 F g–1 at
                    1 A g–1. At a power density of 130 W kg–1, the SSC
                    showed a high energy density of 10.3 W h kg–1 and a
                    long cycle life with 10% capacitance decay over 5000
                    cycles at 1 A g–1. These electrochemical
                    performances suggest that this adopted synthesis
                    route may open a novel avenue for the fabrication of
                    heteroatom-doped carbon electrode materials,
                    especially based on renewable and low-cost
                    cellulose.<br>

                                explored. This study used a
                                retrospective, observational analysis of
                                deidentified tests performed at a

                                disease coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)
                                positivity rates. Over 190,000 patients
                                from all 50 states with SARS-CoV-2
                                results performed mid-March through
                                mid-June, 2020 and matching 25(OH)D
                                results from the preceding 12 months
                                were included. Residential zip code data
                                was required to match with US Census
                                data and perform analyses of
                                race/ethnicity proportions and latitude.
                                A total of 191,779 patients were
                                included (median age, 54 years
                                [interquartile range 40.4–64.7]; 68%
                                female. The SARS-CoV-2 positivity rate
                                was 9.3% (95% C.I. 9.2–9.5%) and the
                                mean seasonally adjusted 25(OH)D was
                                31.7 (SD 11.7). The SARS-CoV-2
                                positivity rate was higher in the 39,190
                                patients with “deficient” 25(OH)D values
                                (&lt;20 ng/mL) (12.5%, 95% C.I.
                                12.2–12.8%) than in the 27,870 patients
                                with “adequate” values (30–34 ng/mL)
                                (8.1%, 95% C.I. 7.8–8.4%) and the 12,321
                                patients with values ≥55 ng/mL (5.9%,
                                95% C.I. 5.5–6.4%). The association
                                between 25(OH)D levels and SARS-CoV-2
                                positivity was best fitted by the
                                weighted second-order polynomial
                                regression, which indicated strong
                                correlation in the total population (R2
                                = 0.96) and in analyses stratified by
                                all studied demographic factors. The
                                association between lower SARS-CoV-2
                                positivity rates and higher circulating
                                25(OH)D levels remained significant in a
                                multivariable logistic model adjusting
                                for all included demographic factors
                                (adjusted odds ratio 0.984 per ng/mL
                                increment, 95% C.I. 0.983–0.986;
                                p&lt;0.001). SARS-CoV-2 positivity is
                                strongly and inversely associated with
                                circulating 25(OH)D levels, a
                                relationship that persists across
                                latitudes, races/ethnicities, both
                                sexes, and age ranges. Our findings
                                provide impetus to explore the role of
                                vitamin D supplementation in reducing
                                the risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection and

                                They/government/better pray to God for
                                forgiveness because we will not forgive

                                … there is no pandemic and there is
                                nothing to vaccinate … statistics tell
                                the truth… we have more deaths due to
                                the collapse of the health service….<br>
                                We want to liberate people from fear…<br>

                                checks, the mandates…police can see
                                what’s going on. We all ride on one
                                trolley. It is in the interest of all of
                                us to halt this path to
                                self-destruction.<br>
                                …People&nbsp; think&nbsp; that&nbsp;

                                the&nbsp; highlanders = górale to
                                liberate Poland… we gave the impulse
                                courage …<br>
                                It is only the words from the TV/not
                                law/ that tell us to limit our
                                lives……the government breaks the law, it
                                breaks the Constitution…<br>

                                Michael Beller, PBS principal counsel:
                                “We go for all the Republican voters and
                                Homeland Security will take their
                                children away…we’ll put them into the
                                re-education camps.”<br>
                                Beller: “Enlightenment camps. They’re
                                nice, they have Sesame Street characters
                                in the classrooms, and they watch PBS
                                all day.”<br>
                                Beller: “Americans are so f*cking dumb.
                                You know, most people are dumb. It’s
                                good to live in a place [Washington,
                                D.C.] where people are educated and know
                                stuff. Could you imagine if you lived in
                                one of these other towns or cities where
                                everybody’s just stupid?”<br>
                                Beller: “What’s great is that COVID is
                                spiking in all the red states right now.
                                So that’s great…a lot of them [red state
                                voters] are sick and dying.”<br>

                                system runs what is known as Cranial
                                Nerve X (10) and C. Nerve (IX) (9) along
                                with C. Nerve (IV) 4 in a manner unlike
                                other vertebrata with exception of your
                                pals, dogs and cats. Pigs also have some
                                aspect of this routing. But not as much
                                as dogs, nor the lesser amount of cats.<br>
                                This CN-X (cranial nerve 10 designation)
                                is key to consciousness as the routing
                                through this area of the brain then is
                                tied to the pancreas. I know, seems
                                goofy, but stick with me here. ...<br>
                                Your gray matter is really micro
                                crystalline (neurons) structures
                                floating in lightly solid oil. It is a
                                very very sophisticated antenna that all
                                of military industrial complex has been
                                working for decades trying to replicate.
                                You can prove this to yourself with
                                another simple philosophical experiment.
                                Go to a car park. Place your car in a
                                slot. Lock it with the little wireless
                                key. Walk away and find out how far you
                                can go before the key stops working to
                                lock/unlock the car. Then walk twice as
                                far away, the take the key and place it
                                on the side of your skull, in contact
                                with the temple ‘dent’ above the jaw,
                                and activate your key. The car will
                                respond. Then keep walking further away
                                until this does not work. That will show
                                you how powerful an antennae you have in
                                your skull. ..<br>

                                Hilgenberg was a student of the renowned
                                Nobel laureate Walter Gerlach, whose
                                work in magnetic spin polarization in
                                1921 had earned him the Nobel Prize.
                                Hilgenberg, however, while within the
                                "mainstream" of physics, was not one to
                                allow his mind to be constrained by
                                conventional concepts, as any glance at
                                his two little known, but quite
                                unconventional and thought-provoking
                                papers will attest. <br>
                                In 1931 Hilgenberg published what may
                                best be called an arcane paper entitled
                                "Gravitation, Tromben, und Wellen in
                                bewegten Medien," or "Gravitation,
                                Beats, and Waves in Moving Media." The
                                title itself is quite suggestive, for it
                                is the first indication that, even
                                before the Nazis, and after relativity,
                                at least one serious and respected
                                German physicist is still thinking of
                                the old idea of an aether, but thinking
                                about it in a way quite different from
                                the static aether concepts of the 19th
                                century that led to the famous
                                Michelson-Morley experiment, and
                                Sagnac's rotational version of it. <br>
                                For Hilgenberg is thinking of a dynamic
                                aether, spurred in part no doubt by the
                                implications of Sagnac's version of the
                                famous experiment. Hilgenberg's paper
                                was arcane and abstruse in the extreme,
                                advocating the idea of gravitation as a
                                vertical ether sink. Thus, as in
                                relativity, gravity was the consequence
                                of a complex geometry, only in
                                Hilgenberg's case, this meant that
                                "mass" was a geometric result manifest,
                                for example, in a rotating body's
                                interior. <br>
                                This led Hilgenberg to propose the very
                                unconventional idea that the earth - or

                                statistical methods are detailed in
                                Appendix 1. We present random effects

                                for studies within each treatment stage,

                                We also perform a simple analysis of the
                                distribution of study effects. If
                                treatment was not effective, the
                                observed effects would be randomly
                                distributed (or more likely to be
                                negative if treatment is harmful). We
                                can compute the probability that the
                                observed percentage of positive results
                                (or higher) could occur due to chance
                                with an ineffective treatment (the

                                binomial test). Analysis of publication
                                bias is important and adjustments may be
                                needed if there is a bias toward
                                publishing positive results.<br>

                                refers to regularly taking medication
                                before becoming sick, in order to
                                prevent or minimize infection. Early
                                Treatment refers to treatment
                                immediately or soon after symptoms
                                appear, while Late Treatment refers to
                                more delayed treatment...<br>

                                Following last week's incursion into the
                                US Capitol building by Trump supporters
                                and the founder of a BLM group, a

                                - a conservative alternative to Twitter
                                where many of the protesters coordinated
                                leading up to the incident which left
                                five people dead. Enby calls the

                                <br>
                                Then, after Amazon announced that they
                                were going kill conservative Twitter
                                rival Parler, @donk_enby began archiving
                                posts prior to the 6th, ultimately
                                preserving approximately 99.9% of its
                                content, according to Gizmodo.<br>

                                lasting public record for future
                                researchers to sift through, @donk_enby
                                began by archiving the posts from that
                                day. The scope of the project quickly
                                broadened, however, as it became
                                increasingly clear that Parler was on
                                borrowed time. Apple and Google
                                announced that Parler would be removed
                                from their app stores because it had
                                failed to properly moderate posts that
                                encouraged violence and crime. The final
                                nail in the coffin came Saturday when
                                Amazon announced it was pulling Parler’s
                                plug. -Gizmodo</font></font></font></font></font><b><font

                        Animal-inspired technology has gone electric.
                        These brightly colored, 3D-printed gels have the
                        potential to create up to 110 volts of
                        electricity in an instant, similar to the
                        electric eel.<br>
                        <br>
                        Rows of small hydrogel dots are packed with
                        positively and negatively charged ions that
                        combine together to mimic an electric eel’s
                        cellular structure. Printing and stacking these
                        hydrogels produces the highest amount of
                        voltage, while a connection to a larger contact
                        area produces the highest current. Scientists
                        are hoping that this system could potentially
                        lead to a device that generates power from
                        inside of the human body.<br>
                        <br>
                        “The electric eel is able to create very, very
                        large amounts of power. And we thought that this
                        was remarkable,” said Anirvan Guha, one of the
                        researchers on the project, designed at the
                        University of Fribourg in Switzerland.&nbsp; “So
                        we started to think about whether or not we
                        could create a system that could generate
                        electricity in the same way.”<br>
                        <br>
                        An eel’s unique ability comes from a specialized
                        organ housing thousands of cells called
                        electrocytes. The chemical make up of these
                        cells allows for a positive or negative charge.
                        The surrounding membranes control the charge by
                        allowing ions to pass through, inciting an
                        electric reaction, or by blocking the ions and
                        returning the organ to a neutral, dormant state.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        When an eel is threatened or stalking prey, a
                        neural impulse is sent to the membranes in the
                        electrocytes, and positive ions flood into the
                        cells. In a second, the electric voltage in each
                        cell can go from zero millivolts to 150
                        millivolts, producing a total of up to 600
                        volts.<br>
                        <br>
                        This new power generator works in a similar way.<br>
                        <br>
                        It uses four different types of hydrogels to
                        mimic the eel’s electrical system. One with a
                        high salt concentration, one with a low salt
                        concentration, and two charged membranes—one
                        negative and one positive.<br>
                        <br>
                        The first attempt at putting this system
                        together involved using a fluidic autosampler
                        that pushed the gels into sequence in tubes. The
                        more gels in a sequence, the higher the voltage.
                        But the researchers couldn’t build an array long
                        enough to produce the desired voltage.<br>
                        <br>
                        So the researchers moved on to 3D
                        printing.&nbsp; They printed a sequence of about
                        2,500 gels on two plastic sheets the size of
                        regular printer paper. When they connected two
                        gel papers, they were able to produce 110 volts
                        of charge within seconds.<br>
                        <br>
                        This was a huge jump in electricity from the
                        previous method, but the current was still too
                        low for most practical applications.<br>
                        <br>
                        At the suggestion of a colleague, they tried
                        connecting the gels through a Miura-ori fold, a
                        type of origami fold that allows the gels to
                        stack on a folded sheet. The gels connect
                        simultaneously with a large contact area, more
                        closely resembling the geometry of the eel’s
                        cells.&nbsp; This method increased the current
                        and prevented energy waste by decreasing the
                        time it took for the gels to connect.<br>
                        <br>
                        Guha says he and his team would love to find a
                        way to make the hydrogels thinner, which would
                        allow for an even higher current. They imagine
                        that one day this system, or one like it, could
                        be used to power internal biological devices
                        such as pacemakers.<br>
                        <br>
                        “Because the power source is ionic gradients,”
                        Guha says, “our hope is that you could implant
                        one of these devices and the power could be
                        maintained from the ionic gradients within the
                        human body.” \<br>

                        </b><b>Abstract</b><br>
                        Light is necessary for life, but prolonged
                        exposure to artificial light is a matter of
                        increasing health concern. Humans are exposed to
                        increased amounts of light in the blue spectrum
                        produced by light-emitting diodes (LEDs), which
                        can interfere with normal sleep cycles. The LED
                        technologies are relatively new; therefore, the
                        long-term effects of exposure to blue light
                        across the lifespan are not understood. We
                        investigated the effects of light in the model
                        organism, Drosophila melanogaster, and
                        determined that flies maintained in daily cycles
                        of 12-h blue LED and 12-h darkness had
                        significantly reduced longevity compared with
                        flies maintained in constant darkness or in
                        white light with blue wavelengths blocked.
                        Exposure of adult flies to 12 h of blue light
                        per day accelerated aging phenotypes causing
                        damage to retinal cells, brain
                        neurodegeneration, and impaired locomotion. We
                        report that brain damage and locomotor
                        impairments do not depend on the degeneration in
                        the retina, as these phenotypes were evident
                        under blue light in flies with genetically
                        ablated eyes. Blue light induces expression of
                        stress-responsive genes in old flies but not in
                        young, suggesting that cumulative light exposure
                        acts as a stressor during aging. We also
                        determined that several known
                        blue-light-sensitive proteins are not acting in
                        pathways mediating detrimental light effects.
                        Our study reveals the unexpected effects of blue
                        light on fly brain and establishes Drosophila as
                        a model in which to investigate long-term
                        effects of blue light at the cellular and
                        organismal level...<br>

                        Batteries based on the reaction of zinc and
                        oxygen have been used for more than a century,
                        but these have been primary (that is,
                        nonrechargeable) cells. These batteries use an
                        alkaline electrolyte and require a four-electron
                        reduction of oxygen to water, which is a slow
                        process. Sun et al. show that with the right
                        choice of nonalkaline electrolyte, the battery
                        can operate using a two-electron
                        zinc-oxygen/zinc peroxide chemistry that is far
                        more reversible. By making the electrolyte
                        hydrophobic, water is excluded from the near
                        surface of the cathode, thus preventing the
                        four-electron reduction. These batteries also
                        show higher energy density and better cycling
                        stability.<br>

                        <b>Abstract</b><br>
                        Rechargeable alkaline zinc-air batteries promise
                        high energy density and safety but suffer from
                        the sluggish 4 electron (e−)/oxygen (O2)
                        chemistry that requires participation of water
                        and from the electrochemical irreversibility
                        originating from parasitic reactions caused by
                        caustic electrolytes and atmospheric carbon
                        dioxide. Here, we report a zinc-O2/zinc peroxide
                        (ZnO2) chemistry that proceeds through a 2e−/O2
                        process in nonalkaline aqueous electrolytes,
                        which enables highly reversible redox reactions
                        in zinc-air batteries. This ZnO2 chemistry was
                        made possible by a water-poor and zinc ion
                        (Zn2+)–rich inner Helmholtz layer on the air
                        cathode caused by the hydrophobic
                        trifluoromethanesulfonate anions. The
                        nonalkaline zinc-air battery thus constructed
                        not only tolerates stable operations in ambient
                        air but also exhibits substantially better
                        reversibility than its alkaline counterpart.<br>
                        “Our innovative, non-alkaline electrolyte brings
                        a previously unknown reversible zinc peroxide
                        (ZnO2)/O2 chemistry into the zinc-air battery,”
                        explains Sun.<br>
                        Compared with conventional alkaline
                        electrolytes, the new non-alkaline electrolyte
                        has some decisive advantages. Foremost among
                        them is that the zinc anode performs more
                        efficiently with a higher chemical stability and
                        electrochemical reversibility – longhand for “it
                        can be recharged”.<br>
                        According to the team, the new zinc-air
                        batteries offer long-term, stable operation: up
                        to 320 cycles and 1600 hours under normal
                        conditions. This standard of performance offers
                        the potential to compete with the rechargeable
                        lithium-ion batteries currently dominating the
                        market.<br>
                        “The zinc-air battery provides a potential
                        alternative battery technology with advantages
                        such as environmental friendliness, high safety
                        and low costs,” says Sun, who emphasises that
                        the technology “still requires further,
                        intensive research and optimisation before its
                        practical application”.<br>
                        The most notable disadvantage of the battery is
                        its rate of charge: a charge/discharge cycle
                        took approximately 20 hours...<br>

                        fitness trackers, and more.<br>
                        Sweating is a natural process for our body to
                        reduce thermal stress. “Sweat is mostly composed
                        of water. When water is evaporated from the skin
                        surface, it lowers the skin temperature and we
                        feel cooler. In our new invention, we created a
                        novel film that is extremely effective in
                        evaporating sweat from our skin and then
                        absorbing the moisture from sweat. We also take
                        this one step further - by converting the
                        moisture from sweat into energy that could be
                        used to power small wearable devices,” explained
                        research team leader Assistant Professor Tan
                        Swee Ching, who is from the NUS Materials
                        Science and Engineering.<br>
                        The main components of the novel thin film are
                        two hygroscopic chemicals – cobalt chloride and
                        ethanolamine. Besides being extremely
                        moisture-absorbent, this film can rapidly
                        release water when exposed to sunlight, and it
                        can be ‘regenerated’ and reused for more than
                        100 times.<br>
                        To make full use of the absorbed sweat, the NUS
                        team has also designed a wearable energy
                        harvesting device comprising eight
                        electrochemical cells (ECs), using the novel
                        film as the electrolyte. Each EC can generate
                        about 0.57 volts of electricity upon absorbing
                        moisture. The overall energy harvested by the
                        device is sufficient to power a light-emitting
                        diode. This proof-of-concept demonstration
                        illustrates the potential of battery-less
                        wearables powered using human sweat.<br>
                        This technological breakthrough was reported in
                        the September print issue of the scientific
                        journal Nano Energy.<br>
                        Absorbing moisture for personal comfort<br>
                        Conventional hygroscopic materials such as
                        zeolites and silica gels have low water uptake
                        and bulk solid structures, making them
                        unsuitable for absorbing moisture from sweat
                        evaporation. In comparison, the new
                        moisture-absorbing film developed by NUS
                        researchers takes in 15 times more moisture and
                        do this 6 times faster than conventional
                        materials.<br>
                        In addition, this innovative film shows a colour
                        change upon absorbing moisture, from blue to
                        purple, and finally pink. This feature can be
                        used as an indicator of the degree of moisture
                        absorption.<br>

                            I realized that everything is about to
                            change. No matter how I vote, no matter what
                            I say, lives are never going to be the same.
                            I have been confused by the hostility of
                            family and friends. I look at people I have
                            known all my life so hate-filled that they
                            agree with opinions they would never express
                            as their own. I think that I may well have
                            entered the Twilight Zone. You can’t justify
                            this insanity. We have become a nation that
                            has lost its collective mind. We see other
                            countries going Socialist and collapsing,
                            but it seems like a great plan to us.
                            Somehow it’s un-American for the census to
                            count how many Americans are in America.
                            People who say there is no such thing as
                            gender are demanding a female President.
                            Universities that advocate equality,
                            discriminate against Asian-Americans in
                            favor of African-Americans. Some people are
                            held responsible for things that happened
                            before they were born, and other people are
                            not held responsible for what they are doing
                            right now. Criminals are caught-and-released
                            to hurt more people, but stopping them is
                            bad because it’s a violation of THEIR
                            rights. People who have never owned slaves
                            should pay slavery reparations to people who
                            have never been slaves. After legislating
                            gender, if a dude pretends to be a woman,
                            you are required to pretend with him. It was
                            cool for Joe Biden to “blackmail” the
                            President of Ukraine, but it’s an
                            impeachable offense if Donald Trump
                            inquiries about it. People who have never
                            been to college should pay the debts of
                            college students who took out huge loans for
                            their degrees. Immigrants with tuberculosis
                            and polio are welcome, but you’d better be
                            able to prove your dog is vaccinated. Irish
                            doctors and German engineers who want to
                            immigrate to the US must go through a
                            rigorous vetting process, but any illiterate
                            gang-bangers who jump the southern fence are
                            welcomed. $5 billion for border security is
                            too expensive, but $1.5 trillion for “free”
                            health care is not. If you cheat to get into
                            college you go to prison, but if you cheat
                            to get into the country you go to college
                            for free. And, pointing out all this
                            hypocrisy somehow makes us “racists”!
                            Nothing makes sense anymore, no values, no
                            morals, no civility and people are dying of
                            a Chinese virus, but it is racist to refer
                            to it as Chinese even though it began in
                            China. We are clearly living in an
                            upside-down world where right is wrong and
                            wrong is right, where moral is immoral and
                            immoral is moral, where good is evil and
                            evil is good, where killing murderers is
                            wrong, but killing innocent babies is right.
                            Wake up America. The great unsinkable ship
                            Titanic America has hit an iceberg, is
                            taking on water and sinking fast.</font></font><br>

                            “We now live in a nation where doctors

                        yesterday's protest in Washington D.C., a
                        Trurmp-supporting US Air Force Veteran, Ashli
                        Babbitt, was shot dead by a Capitol Police
                        officer (who has been placed on leave) as she
                        attempted to climb through a broken window to
                        bypass a barricade, along with other Trump
                        supporters.<br>
                        Filming the incident from behind Babbit,
                        however, was Utah resident John Sullivan -
                        founder of the far-left organization "Insurgence
                        USA" who made headlines in July after he was
                        arrested for intimidating drivers in Provo.
                        Sullivan was interviewed by the Daily Mail and
                        CNN following Wednesday's shooting - both of
                        which failed to provide a satisfactory answer as
                        to why he was there in the first place...<br>

                        these evil doers are. they do not hold the light

                        The Queen warned her subjects that world leaders

                        to create a "dark new dawn" for humanity.<br>
                        Senior BBC production staff and palace advisors
                        scrambled to cancel the filming, but not before
                        the Queen detailed her deepest fears that the
                        troubles of 2020 marked the beginning of

                        of the 8th largest global defense contractor,
                        Leonardo SpA, provided a shocking deposition
                        detailing his role in the most elaborate
                        criminal act affecting a US election.
                        Corroborating the DNI Ratcliff’s report of
                        international intrusion, Arturo D’elio outlined
                        the scheme that proved successful in using
                        Leonardo computer systems and military
                        satellites located in Pescara, Italy. Recent
                        reports of a hack at Leonardo now appear to have
                        been an orchestrated cover to mitigate blowback

                        St. Petersburg, Russia, and studied under the
                        Strategic Rocket Force. He is an expert today on

                        Nuclear, and high yield Explosives,(CBRNE) and
                        Pandemic preparedness. His view is that these

                        bio-weapon RND used to develop viral weapons. He

                        American people are so passive concerning this
                        enemy takeover. He believes that this fake

                        As Dr. Fauci walks back criticisms of Britain's
                        decision to grant emergency approval to the
                        Pfzier-BioNTech - something Dr. Fauci
                        characterized as "rushed" earlier this week

                        Speaking in an off-the-cuff manner, Gundlach
                        raised questions about the timeline for
                        vaccine-induced COVID herd immunity, something
                        Sweden's Anders Tegnell recently affirmed
                        remains a poorly understood concept, that some

                          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Amalek</b>: A demonic being
                        named in the collection of Jewish lore known as
                        the Zohar. According to this text, Amalek is the
                        greatest impurity. He is credited with the
                        ability to poison a person so thoroughly that he
                        can bring about the death of the soul. In the
                        Zohar, Amalek is equated to the fallen angel
                        Samael. Although identified as separate
                        entities, they are nevertheless presented as
                        being the same essential being. Notably,
                        Samael's name is sometimes translated as “poison
                        of God.”<br>

                        was born and raised in the Soviet Union, and
                        became a Military Doctor in St. Petersburg,
                        Russia, and studied under the Strategic Rocket
                        Force. He is an expert today on bio-weapons,
                        Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and
                        high yield Explosives,(CBRNE) and Pandemic
                        preparedness. His view is that these vaccines
                        are very similar technology to the bio-weapon
                        RND used to develop viral weapons. He fully
                        understands that the plan of depopulation and
                        mandatory vaccinations will be at our doorstep
                        very soon, and is shocked that the American
                        people are so passive concerning this enemy
                        takeover. He believes that this fake pandemic is
                        the means by which a communist global government
                        will be ushered into existence; one that cannot

                        your common 2 wire electrolysis colloidal silver
                        maker.<br>
                        This device is based upon creating a Magnetic
                        Field to Magnetically Charge the glass of water
                        with Silver Frequencies.<br>
                        Walter Russell at philosophy.org drew schematics
                        for this type of technology. Video at
                        joecellwaterscience.com<br>
                        If you want to understand how Field Science is
                        better than particle science, then this is the
                        product for you.<br>
                        This Device is built using Magnetic Field
                        Orientations. It may look simple but each silver
                        wire has a Polarity and in this format they are
                        ALL ALIGNED. With Field Science the voltage and
                        amperage need to be harmonically tuned to the
                        frequency of Silver. Random is not harmonic when
                        it comes to choosing a Power Supply. The
                        'source' of DC is also important and battery
                        power is different to spinning magnet power.
                        Particle Science says its all just electrons but
                        Field Science ways its a Wave Form and each
                        source is a different Wave or Frequency. Tesla
                        said "Everything is Energy, Frequency and
                        Vibration". Tesla did NOT agree with the
                        electron theory. See Walter Russell's "In the
                        Wave Lies the Secret of Creation". A Switching
                        power supply verses a Linear Power supply will
                        show a noticeable difference in the Silver Water
                        produced. We use 'old school' power supplies or
                        a (Tesla) Coil AC to DC. Even the direction of
                        the twisting of the wires and that they are not
                        soldered nor cut, has a huge bearing on the
                        resultant quality of Silver Water this device
                        makes.<br>
                        Bottom line is all the theory about colloidal
                        silver does NOT apply to this device except for
                        its uses. And it has many other uses that are
                        not FDA approved so I cannot print them here.<br>
                        SilverJoe water is superior to colloidal silver
                        water in that one can drink any quantity per day
                        and it has ALL the attributes of 2 wire silver
                        water.<br>
                        With the proper choice of Water for this device,
                        the Silver Rods will never wear out. Explained
                        in the instructions on the USB<br>
                        This device will "test" waters. The Magnetic
                        Charge imparted to the water 'activates' the
                        Memory of the water, so that in places like the
                        Gold Coast Aust, where they recycle 'grey water'
                        back into the Town Water Supplies, this device
                        will make the glass of water stink like a sewer
                        in just a minute of operation. So clearly its
                        doing something that no 2 wired outdated device
                        does. The proper water is Bottled at the Source
                        Spring Water, where it will NOT degrade or
                        tarnish the rods. You can use any water and it
                        will show discoloration when impurities in the
                        water are present. Making this a water testing
                        device so you will know which bottled waters to
                        buy and drink. ...<br>

                      Ivermectin effectiveness ... 83% reduction in
                      covid mortality.</b><b><br>
                    </b>Dr Andrew Hill of the Department of Pharmacology
                    at the University of Liverpool (UK) is currently
                    performing a WHO-sponsored review and meta-analysis
                    of randomized controlled trials of ivermectin
                    against covid. In the following 12-minute video, Dr
                    Hill is presenting his preliminary results, which
                    indicate a highly significant 83% reduction in covid
                    mortality (95% CI 65%-92%).<br>
                    This result is based on in-hospital trials, so it
                    does not yet take into account early ambulatory and
                    prophylactic treatment. The authors of the review
                    intend to include three more trials, due to be
                    published sometime in January, before providing a
                    final conclusion. At the end of his presentation, Dr
                    Hill describes ivermectin as a potentially
                    “transformational treatment”.<br>

                    </b><b>Enabling Drug Discovery &amp; Development</b><b><br>
                    </b>We built Moderna on the guiding premise that if
                    using mRNA as a medicine works for one disease, it
                    should work for many diseases. And, if this is
                    possible – given the right approach and
                    infrastructure – it could meaningfully improve how
                    medicines are discovered, developed and
                    manufactured.<br>
                    <b>Our Operating System</b><br>
                    Recognizing the broad potential of mRNA science, we
                    set out to create an mRNA technology platform that
                    functions very much like an operating system on a
                    computer. It is designed so that it can plug and
                    play interchangeably with different programs. In our
                    case, the “program” or “app” is our mRNA drug – the
                    unique mRNA sequence that codes for a protein.<br>

                    Analysis conducted by DataScience and released
                    through BASEDmedia constructed a statistical model
                    to predict relative performance for either candidate
                    based upon U.S. Census county data to 90% accuracy.<br>
                    This analysis revealed that counties that used
                    Dominion and Hart InterCivic ballot counting devices
                    and software consistently gave a 5% vote advantage
                    to candidate Joe Biden over President Trump. This
                    advantage was observed regardless of the county's
                    majority political party affiliation nor urban,
                    suburban, or rural area demographics.<br>

                    </b>By Chris Micheli<br>
                    On December 7, the first day of the California
                    Legislature’s 2021-22 Session, Assembly Member Ed
                    Chau introduced Assembly Bill (AB) 35, which would
                    require disclosure of social media policies. AB 35
                    would add Chapter 22.4 (commencing with Section
                    22595) to Division 8 of the Business and Professions
                    Code.<br>
                    AB 35 would require a person that operates a social
                    media platform to disclose whether or not that
                    social media platform has a policy or mechanism in
                    place to address the spread of misinformation. AB 35
                    would require the disclosure to be made easily
                    accessible on the social media platform’s website
                    and mobile application.<br>
                    In addition, AB 35 would authorize the Attorney
                    General or any district attorney, county counsel, or
                    city attorney to enforce violations of its
                    provisions and would subject a person to a civil

                    admitting that more than 98 million Americans
                    received one or more doses of polio vaccine within
                    an 8-year span from 1955-1963 when a proportion of
                    the vaccine was contaminated with a cancer causing
                    polyomavirus called SV40. It has been estimated that
                    10-30 million Americans could have received an SV40

                    </b><b>Abstract</b><b><br>
                    </b>The common Grape L. (Vitaceae) is regarded as an
                    important medicinal plant. European healers have
                    suggested the use of grapevine sap, juice, and whole
                    grape in the treatment of pain, allergic reactions,
                    inflammation, and to promote wound healing. We
                    evaluated grape-skin powder for its wound-healing
                    activity using an excision wound model in rats.
                    Animals were randomly divided into three groups of
                    six (n = 6) each. The test group animals were
                    treated topically with the grape-skin powder (100
                    mg/kg/day). The controls and standard group animals
                    were treated with petroleum jelly and mupirocin
                    ointment respectively. Healing was assessed by the
                    rate of wound contraction, period of
                    epithelialization, and hydroxyproline content. On
                    day 13, treatment of the wounds with grape-skin
                    powder enhanced significantly the rate of wound
                    contraction (100 %). Treated animals showed
                    significant decrease in the epithelialization period
                    (p &lt; 0.000) and increase in the hydroxyproline
                    content (p &lt; 0.05) when compared to control and
                    the standard. Histological analysis was also
                    consistent with the proposal that grape-skin powder
                    exhibits significant wound-healing potential.
                    Increased rate of wound contraction, hydroxyproline
                    content, and decrease in epithelialization time in
                    the treated animals support the use of grape-skin
                    powder in the management of wound healing.<br>

                      Abstract</b><br>
                    Saliva is a complex fluid, which influences oral
                    health through specific and nonspecific physical and
                    chemical properties. The importance of saliva in our
                    everyday activities and the medicinal properties it
                    possesses are often taken for granted. However, when
                    disruptions in the quality or quantity of saliva do
                    occur in an individual, it is likely that he or she
                    will experience detrimental effects on oral and
                    systemic health. Often head and neck radiotherapy
                    has serious and detrimental side effects on the oral
                    cavity including the loss of salivary gland function
                    and a persistent complaint of a dry mouth
                    (xerostomia). Thus, saliva has a myriad of
                    beneficial functions that are essential to our
                    well-being. Although saliva has been extensively
                    investigated as a medium, few laboratories have
                    studied saliva in the context of its role in
                    maintaining oral and general health.<br>

                    </b><b>Abstract</b><br>
                    Although the essentiality of zinc for plants and
                    animals has been known for many decades, the
                    essentiality of zinc for humans was recognized only
                    40 years ago in the Middle East. The zinc-deficient
                    patients had severe immune dysfunctions, inasmuch as
                    they died of intercurrent infections by the time
                    they were 25 years of age. In our studies in an
                    experimental human model of zinc deficiency, we
                    documented decreased serum testosterone level,
                    oligospermia, severe immune dysfunctions mainly
                    affecting T helper cells, hyperammonemia,
                    neurosensory disorders, and decreased lean body
                    mass. It appears that zinc deficiency is prevalent
                    in the developing world and as many as two billion
                    subjects may be growth retarded due to zinc
                    deficiency. Besides growth retardation and immune
                    dysfunctions, cognitive impairment due to zinc
                    deficiency also has been reported recently. Our
                    studies in the cell culture models showed that the
                    activation of many zinc-dependent enzymes and
                    transcription factors were adversely affected due to
                    zinc deficiency. In HUT-78 (T helper 0 [Th0] cell
                    line), we showed that a decrease in gene expression
                    of interleukin-2 (IL-2) and IL-2 receptor α(IL-2Rα)
                    were due to decreased activation of nuclear
                    factor-κB (NF-κB) in zinc deficient cells. Decreased
                    NF-κB activation in HUT-78 due to zinc deficiency
                    was due to decreased binding of NF-κB to DNA,
                    decreased level of NF-κB p105 (the precursor of
                    NF-κB p50) mRNA, decreased κB inhibitory protein
                    (IκB) phosphorylation, and decreased Iκ κ. These
                    effects of zinc were cell specific. Zinc also is an
                    antioxidant and has anti-inflammatory actions. The
                    therapeutic roles of zinc in acute infantile
                    diarrhea, acrodermatitis enteropathica, prevention
                    of blindness in patients with age-related macular
                    degeneration, and treatment of common cold with zinc
                    have been reported. In HL-60 cells (promyelocytic
                    leukemia cell line), zinc enhances the up-regulation
                    of A20 mRNA, which, via TRAF pathway, decreases
                    NF-κB activation, leading to decreased gene
                    expression and generation of tumor necrosis factor-α
                    (TNF-α), IL-1β, and IL-8. We have reported recently
                    that in both young adults and elderly subjects, zinc
                    supplementation decreased oxidative stress markers
                    and generation of inflammatory cytokines.<br>

                    </b>Abnormalities in taste and smell are commonly
                    reported in patients receiving chemotherapy and may
                    hinder appetite, dietary intake, nutritional
                    well-being, and quality of life. Oral zinc has been
                    used to treat taste and smell abnormalities in
                    several altered physiologic states, including renal
                    failure, liver disease, head trauma, and pregnancy,
                    with varying results. The authors conducted a
                    double-blinded, placebo-controlled randomized clinic
                    trial over 3 months. Eligible patients were those
                    taking chemotherapy that had alterations in taste
                    and/or smell. The measurement of the primary end
                    point, improvement in altered taste and smell, was
                    made using a 0–100 scale (100 describing no loss or
                    distortion in taste and smell, and 0 describing the
                    worst distortion or loss of taste and smell).
                    Twenty-nine subjects were enrolled in each treatment
                    group, of whom 31 were white, 26 African American,
                    and 1 Native American. Forty-one patients were
                    female. A wide range of cancer types was
                    represented, with breast the most common (21
                    patients). The zinc dose was 220 mg orally twice
                    daily (equivalent of 50 mg elemental zinc twice
                    daily). There was no statistically significant
                    improvement in loss or distortion of taste or smell
                    with the addition of zinc. There was a trend toward

                    </b><b>Abstract</b><b><br>
                    </b>Zinc is an essential trace element. In the
                    mouth, it is present naturally in plaque, saliva and
                    enamel. Zinc is formulated into oral health products
                    to control plaque, reduce malodour and inhibit
                    calculus formation. It has good oral substantivity,
                    and elevated concentrations can persist for many
                    hours in plaque and saliva following delivery from
                    mouthrinses and toothpastes. Although low
                    concentrations of zinc can both reduce enamel
                    demineralisation and modify remineralisation, during
                    caries clinical trials, the addition of zinc to
                    fluoride toothpastes has not affected their ability
                    to reduce caries. Mechanistic studies may help
                    explain this apparent contradiction. Zinc is readily
                    desorbed from hydroxyapatite by calcium, which is
                    plentiful in plaque and saliva. Where crystal-growth
                    sites remain occupied by zinc despite this, they may
                    simply be 'over-grown' by remineralisation initiated
                    at unoccupied sites. Further, under certain
                    conditions, low concentrations of zinc can enhance
                    remineralisation of enamel lesions, by retarding
                    lesion arrestment. Although this may help to explain
                    the apparent lack of an overall zinc effect on
                    caries, it seems unlikely that any negative effects
                    would be countered exactly by positive effects.
                    Further mechanistic studies, complementing
                    well-designed in vitro and in situ caries studies,
                    should lead to further understanding of the
                    zinc-enamel interactions relevant to
                    demineralisation and remineralisation.<br>

                    </b><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By Gary
                      D. Barnett</b><br>
                    <i>“For the first time in my life I began to realize
                      that it is not evil and brutality, but nearly
                      always weakness, that is to blame for the worst
                      things that happen in this world.”</i><i><br>
                    </i><i>~ Stefan Zweig</i><br>
                    Over time, it becomes quite obvious to those with
                    the ability to think that the people at large bring
                    about voluntarily their own enslavement, their own
                    lots in life, and their own misery. Given the vast
                    numbers of people as opposed to rulers, there is no
                    need for such pathetic behavior, but the average
                    human psyche seems to gravitate toward a life of
                    rule instead of a life of self-responsibility. This
                    is caused by a weakness of mind, and because of this
                    attempt to escape individual responsibility;
                    complete avoidance of the truth is necessary. This
                    is the state of affairs today in this country, as
                    the masses are aggressively hiding from the truth,
                    with the ‘hope’ of being the recipient of a few
                    crumbs from their masters in order to survive...<br>
                    The aim of power is always more power, and
                    therefore, the powerful never cease in their efforts
                    to fool the people into believing that monsters from
                    afar, or mysterious monsters from within are to be
                    feared by all. Fear breeds weakness, and due to this
                    unnecessary state of mind, dependence on power
                    becomes normalized. Once this societal reliance on
                    the ruling hierarchy is in place, power and control
                    become much easier to achieve. This is all done with
                    smoke and mirrors and the highest level of
                    propaganda, as no reality can support this
                    unwarranted state of confusion and vulnerability by
                    the majority that has by design led to the surrender
                    of freedom due only to deceit...<br>

                    is also a magnetic excursion, usually major
                    volcanoes as well, and considerable biosphere
                    stress. This is NOT doomsday, but it is very, VERY
                    bad - especially when the sun releases the

                    AE911Truth’s new documentary about Dr. Leroy
                    Hulsey’s groundbreaking new study on WTC7<br>
                    the story of the scientific study of World Trade
                    Center building 7 (WTC 7) recently published by the
                    University of Alaska Fairbanks. The study was led by
                    structural engineering professor J. Leroy Hulsey and
                    took nearly five years to complete. It evaluated the
                    possibilities for destruction of WTC 7 using two
                    versions of high-tech computer software that
                    simulated the structural components of the building
                    and the forces that acted upon it on September 11th.<br>
                    After inputting worst case conditions, and
                    painstakingly eliminating what didn’t happen, Hulsey
                    and his team of engineers came to the following
                    conclusions:<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The principal conclusion of our
                    study is that fire did not cause the collapse of WTC
                    7 on 9/11, contrary to the conclusions of NIST and
                    private engineering firms that studied the collapse.
                    The secondary conclusion of our study is that the
                    collapse of WTC 7 was a global failure involving the
                    near-simultaneous failure of every column in the
                    building.<br>

                    A dose of radio waves seems to encourage plant

                    Margaret Ahmad at Sorbonne University in Paris,
                    France, and her colleagues exposed thale cress
                    seedlings (Arabidopsis thaliana) to weak pulses of
                    radio frequency (RF) radiation at 7 megahertz, a
                    frequency normally used by amateur radio operators.<br>
                    The team found that this altered the activity of a

                    You see them everywhere. Men and women walking down
                    the street, all of them with masks on their faces
                    and cell phones in their hands. People jogging, with
                    masks covering their faces and cell phones in their
                    hands. Mothers wheeling their babies with one hand,
                    holding a cell phone in the other hand, with a mask
                    covering their face.<br>
                    The world has gone insane.<br>
                    Back in May, the President of Tanzania announced
                    that a goat, a quail, and a papaya had tested
                    positive for COVID-19. People did not stop eating
                    papayas. But when farmed minks began testing
                    positive, the response has been to kill them all.<br>
                    After a few minks in the Netherlands tested positive
                    in April, 570,000 minks were slaughtered. Minks
                    started testing positive and being killed in Denmark
                    in June, and on November 4, Denmark announced it
                    would destroy the rest of its 17 million minks.
                    Sanity finally broke out in that country, and the
                    eradication campaign stopped after only 2.5 million
                    minks were slaughtered. But minks have also been
                    killed in Spain, Sweden, Greece, France, and the
                    United States.<br>
                    Lions, tigers and leopards in zoos have tested
                    positive.<br>
                    People have been testing their dogs and cats, and lo
                    and behold, some of them have tested positive, and
                    on May 6, the Centers for Disease Control created a
                    webpage titled “What to Do if Your Pet Tests
                    Positive for the Virus that Causes COVID-19.” This
                    is what you are supposed to do: “Isolate the pet
                    from everyone else, including other pets.” “Keep
                    your pet at least 6 feet away from other pets and
                    people.” “If you have a private backyard where your
                    dog can go to the bathroom, do not take them for
                    walks.” But, the CDC warns, “Do not wipe or bathe
                    your pet with… hand sanitizer,” and “Do not try to
                    put a mask on your pet.”<br>
                    It is becoming obvious that no matter what you test
                    — minks, lions, dogs, papayas, people, or anything
                    else — you will get positive results, and that the
                    results mean nothing. Just wait until someone tests
                    a cow. Kill all the cows, and no more meat or dairy
                    products! Vaccinate every pet and farm animal in the
                    world! Do contact tracing for every pet that comes
                    in contact with an infected pet!<br>
                    We have a pandemic, all right, but it is a pandemic
                    of insanity, not COVID-19. The world — the entire
                    world, not just a few people or a few countries or a
                    few cultures — has forgotten what life is. Life is
                    community. It is social contact, touching,
                    breathing, sharing. It is oxygen. People are dying
                    because their masks are making them hypoxic. Cancer
                    cells thrive in the absence of oxygen. If you have
                    cancer, and you wear a mask, you are making your
                    cancer grow. And life is bacteria and viruses.
                    Ninety-nine percent of all bacteria and viruses are
                    beneficial and necessary — necessary for life, and
                    necessary for evolution. If you disinfect the
                    surface of the earth, you will put an end to life.
                    We did not disinfect the world for smallpox,
                    influenza, measles, or tuberculosis. But we are
                    doing it for “COVID-19.”<br>
                    And we are blaming every symptom known to man on
                    “COVID-19.” COVID-19 is a respiratory virus, closely
                    related to the common cold. But we have made a
                    caricature of it. Suddenly a coronavirus is a
                    magical piece of RNA, created by Dracula, that will
                    damage your kidneys or your heart or give you a
                    stroke.<br>
                    There is another, very real pandemic that is out of
                    control: a pandemic of radiation. A pandemic that
                    does cause kidney and heart damage and strokes, in
                    addition to pneumonia. The radiation is produced by
                    cell phones. The cell phones with which mothers are
                    irradiating their babies, and joggers are
                    irradiating their hearts. The cell phones with which
                    7 billion people are irradiating the birds, insects
                    and flowers around them. The radiation that will
                    kill all 7 billion of us, unless we put an end to
                    it.<br>

                    privacy, ecology, relationships... The mobile phone
                    is a poison for each of these elements.” ...<br>
                    If you have come to this website, it is likely that
                    you already know or suspect, from the science or
                    from your own experience, or both, that cell phones
                    are damaging life on Earth. For those still in
                    doubt, please consider:<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A careful study (Salford et al.
                    2003) on the effects of cell phones on the brain
                    have found that even a single two-hour exposure to a
                    cell phone permanently destroys up to two percent of
                    an animal's brain cells. Everyone who uses a cell
                    phone has some degree of brain damage. The damage
                    occurs whether or not you hold the cell phone next
                    to your head.<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A single ten-minute exposure of a
                    honey bee to a cell phone (Kumar et al. 2011) brings
                    the bee’s metabolism to a virtual standstill. She
                    can no longer digest sugars, fats or proteins and
                    can no longer use the oxygen she is breathing.
                    Irradiated bees die of oxygen starvation. Because
                    bees have such a high metabolic rate, it happens to
                    them very quickly. The same thing is happening,
                    slowly or quickly, to every living thing on Earth.<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We evolved without microwave
                    radiation. When you hold a cell phone to your head,
                    you are exposing your brain to about 200 billion
                    times more microwave radiation than you get during
                    the day from the Sun. If Neil Armstrong had brought
                    a cell phone to the Moon in 1969, it would have
                    appeared from Earth to be the brightest object in
                    the universe in the microwave spectrum. In the
                    daytime, the sun would have been brighter, but at
                    night, the cell phone would have outshone every
                    star.<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You cannot expect to use a cell
                    phone even once, even in an emergency, without the
                    entire wireless infrastructure of the planet,
                    including all the towers and satellites, being
                    there, ready to forward your message to its
                    destination somewhere else on Earth. The entire
                    Earth must be engulfed in an ocean of radiation at
                    all times just so you can use your phone in an
                    emergency.<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your subscription to cell phone
                    service, together with the subscriptions of billions
                    of other people, is what is funding the
                    ever-expanding network of towers and satellites.
                    Your subscription is funding and creating the demand
                    for 5G, the Internet of Things, and SpaceX's planned
                    fleet of 12,000+ satellites. The International
                    Appeal to Stop 5G on Earth and in Space, complete
                    with links to over 10,000 scientific studies,
                    explains why 5G is an immediate threat to life on
                    Earth...<br>

                    electromagnetic fields for the human body is a
                    growing con-cern for our society. We have previously
                    shown that weak pulsed microwaves give rise to a
                    signifi-cant leakage of albumin through the
                    blood–brain barrier. In this study we investigated
                    whether apathologic leakage across the blood–brain
                    barrier might be combined with damage to the
                    neurons.Three groups each of eight rats were exposed
                    for 2 hr to Global System for MobileCommunications
                    (GSM) mobile phone electromagnetic fields of
                    different strengths. We foundhighly significant
                    (p&lt; 0.002) evidence for neuronal damage in the
                    cortex, hippocampus, and basalganglia in the brains
                    of exposed rats. Key words:blood–brain barrier,

                    The present study was carried out to find the effect
                    of cell phone radiations on various biomolecules in
                    the adult workers of Apis mellifera L. The results
                    of the treated adults were analyzed and compared
                    with the control. Radiation from the cell phone
                    influences honey bees’ behavior and physiology.
                    There was reduced motor activity of the worker bees
                    on the comb initially, followed by en masse
                    migration and movement toward “talk mode” cell
                    phone. The initial quiet period was characterized by
                    rise in concentration of biomolecules including
                    proteins, carbohydrates and lipids, perhaps due to
                    stimulation of body mechanism to fight the stressful
                    condition created by the radiations. At later stages
                    of exposure, there was a slight decline in the
                    concentration of biomolecules probably because the
                    body had adapted to the stimulus.<br>

                      to repair our bones</b><br>
                    New research by Queensland University of Technology
                    is helping scientists better understand how bone
                    cells work and may one day lead to the development
                    of technology that can speed up the time it takes to
                    heal fractured and broken bones.<br>
                    QUT recent graduate Dr Gwynne Hannay has built a
                    gadget capable of promoting bone cell formation in
                    the laboratory.<br>
                    Dr Hannay said his device replicated the mechanical
                    and electrical stimulants which occurred naturally
                    in the body to repair fractured and broken bones.<br>
                    "This device is about trying to grow bone tissue in
                    the same environment our body grows bones. I have
                    taken bone cells and put them in the physical
                    environment they would experience in the body, and
                    then varied the stimulants to extract a beneficial
                    environment for tissue growth," he said.<br>
                    Dr Hannay's research has advanced the understanding
                    of how bone cells can be stimulated to heal factures
                    and has for the first time combined the artificial
                    reproduction of both mechanical and electrical
                    stimulants.<br>
                    "Previous research has looked at both of these
                    stimulants individually, but not together,
                    neglecting the fact that both are occurring in
                    normal healthy bone during fracture healing"<br>
                    He said by combining the two stimulants, a
                    synergistic effect was produced.<br>
                    "That means when you apply both the mechanical and
                    electrical stimulants together a result greater than
                    the sum of the two stimulants applied individually
                    is achieved. It creates a greater output," he said.<br>
                    Dr Hannay said that unfortunately when bones
                    fractured or broke, especially in older people, the
                    healing process could stall.<br>
                    "We find bones can get half way through the healing
                    process but won't heal properly and with an aging
                    population this is a growing problem for orthopaedic
                    surgeons to accommodate and one that is not easily
                    solved with current methodologies," he said.<br>
                    "In the future we might be able to make a device
                    utilising these combined stimulants that could be
                    attached to the body and help heal the bone."<br>
                    Additionally, normal fractures that would otherwise
                    heal successfully could be accelerated with the use
                    of these stimulants.<br>
                    Dr Hannay said normal fractures in young, healthy
                    people took approximately six to eight weeks to
                    heal.<br>
                    "It might be possible to significantly reduce the
                    healing time. That would be the goal."<br>
                    Dr Hannay graduated from QUT with a PhD from the
                    Faculty of Built Environment and Engineering.<br>

                    The aim of this project was to evaluate the effects
                    of mechanical strain and indirect electrical
                    stimulation upon the development of bone forming
                    osteoblast cells and any possible synergistic
                    effects of the two stimulants. This aim was achieved
                    by using a novel device, designed and developed with
                    the capability of creating a cell substrate surface
                    strain along with an exogenous electrical stimulant
                    individually or at the same time. Proliferation and
                    differentiation was determined as a measure of
                    cellular development. The indirect electrical
                    stimulation was achieved through the use of pulsed
                    electromagnetic field (PEMF) stimulation while the
                    mechanical strain was produced from the dynamic
                    stretching of a deformable cell substrate. The PEMF
                    signal mimicked a clinically available bone growth
                    stimulator signal. Results showed reduced
                    proliferation and increased differentiation
                    (alkaline phosphatase activity) with SaOS-2
                    osteoblast-like cell cultures, which were exposed to
                    indirect electrical stimulation. MG-63
                    osteoblast-like cell cultures also showed reduced
                    proliferation, however they did not show an increase
                    in their differentiation with PEMF exposure.
                    Mechanical stimulation alone did not have a
                    significant effect over either proliferation or
                    differentiation, while a dual mechanical and
                    electrical stimulation resulted in cellular
                    differentiation significantly increasing. It is
                    possible a synergistic interaction between the two
                    stimulants is occurring on a biological level. <br>
