<div style="text-align: center; color: rgb(0, 102, 0);"><big><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Amateur weatherman predicts January could
be the coldest since 1740</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
</big></div>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Britain should be prepared for more
snow chaos according to a local forecaster who believes January could
be the coldest in 270 years.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Amateur weatherman Harry Kershaw, 84,
from Sale, correctly predicted that last winter would be similar to the
1979 Winter of Discontent.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Now he believes the coming January
could be as bad as in 1740, when the Thames froze in London and daytime
temperatures failed to rise above -9C.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">He said: "Between August and October
the weather seemed to be the same as 1986, which was followed by the
coldest January since 1740.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">"I believe the last three weeks of
January and the first week of February next year could be the coldest
we&#8217;ve had for 270 years."</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Harry, who began forecasting as a
merchant seaman, uses a system developed by the German army during the
Second World War known as &#8216;similarity forecasting'.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">He matches conditions with those of
previous years and then predicts that future weather will follow a
similar pattern &#8211; often with uncanny accuracy.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">In early 2007, his predictions of a
miserable summer were at odds with official forecasts, but he was
right. He also warned of wet weather last year when the Met Office told
us to prepare for a &#8216;barbecue summer&#8217;.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Harry says there have been
similarities between August and November with the conditions before the
bad winter of 1987, such as matches in the Atlantic weather maps.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The January of 1987 was the worst
since 1740, when it was so cold that pigs were roasted at a fair on the
frozen Thames.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Harry believes the current cold spell
will last until about December 7, when the weather will start to get
milder. He believes Christmas Day could be wet. He added: ""I&#8217;m looking
forward to seeing if I'm right. If my forecast is correct it shows that
this is a good system and should be looked at carefully."</span><br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Wait - isn't that the guy from. . . .
It's Shawn something. Or was it
John?</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Then comes the awkward stammer.
Perhaps a discreet peek at the person's
name tag. The rising panic!</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">It is one of society's most common
vexations. Forgetting a name. Now,
scientists at Temple University and the University of Pennsylvania have
hit on an intriguing remedy: a weak dose of electricity to the head.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The amount of current is just 1.5
milliamperes, barely enough to
provoke a faint tingling on the scalp, yet it seemed to work in a
study, published this month in the journal Neuropsychologia. Young
adults were markedly better at recalling the names of semifamous people
while receiving the small doses of electricity, prompting the
researchers to launch a new study of older people.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The technique is called transcranial
direct current stimulation, and it
is being studied as a treatment for a range of ills, among them
depression, attention-deficit disorder, and stroke. At Penn, scientists
are planning to try the technique this fall on stroke patients with
aphasia - a brain disorder marked by a reduced ability to speak. A
companion technology, transcranial magnetic stimulation, is
FDA-approved to treat depression, though the effects are modest.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Perhaps inevitably, nonscientists who
hear about these techniques tend
to bring up the 1975 movie One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, in which
Jack Nicholson's character receives electroconvulsive therapy - a
technique designed to induce a seizure.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Yet the amount of electricity used in
the Temple-Penn study was a tiny
fraction of what is used today in electroconvulsive therapy, which in
turn is much less than what was depicted in the film.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">In fact, the amount of current used in
transcranial direct current
stimulation (tDCS) is so small that some scientists were initially
skeptical that it would be useful, said James Stinear, a
neurophysiologist at the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Stinear, who is studying the use of
tDCS to help stroke patients regain
use of their limbs, said hundreds of studies had now found the
technique to have potential for brain-related ills.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">"I think the skeptics have now been
pretty much put to rest by some
good studies," Stinear said, adding that much work needs to be done to
understand just what is happening.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The way this mild stimulation seems to
work is by making neurons more
likely to fire, said Temple psychologist Ingrid Olson, senior author of
the name-recall study. No adverse effects have been found.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">"It kind of makes them more ready to
act," she said of the neurons.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">In Olson's study, the electric current
was delivered via the scalp to
the brain's anterior temporal lobes, which are located just in front of
the ears. People were shown dozens of photographs of famous and
semifamous people while being subjected to three conditions: current to
the right side, to the left side, and a "sham" condition in which the
power was turned off.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The stimulation had no apparent impact
on overall accuracy, likely
because many of the celebrities were instantly recognizable, so there
was no room for improvement, Olson said.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">But when the scientists analyzed those
celebrities who took people more
than five seconds to identify, the stimulation did seem to make a
difference. When receiving current to the right side of the head, the
subjects were correct 38 percent of the time - up from 27 percent
accuracy in the sham condition.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The researchers think the effect was
seen on the right side because the
right anterior temporal lobe plays a role in processing information
about people's identities.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The 15 research subjects were ages 19
to 37, and some of them could
apparently use a refresher course in current events. One celebrity that
caused many to stumble was former British Prime Minister Tony Blair.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">"You know you've seen him before,"
Olson said, "but remembering who he
is hard for Americans."</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Another puzzler for this younger crowd
was that sex symbol of yore, Mae
West. Everyone knew former President John F. Kennedy.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The 1.5 milliamperes were delivered to
the scalp via pads soaked in
saline solution. The amount of electricity is less than one-tenth of
the current flowing through the earbuds on an iPod, said Richard A. Di
Dio, who teaches physics at La Salle University and did not take part
in the study..</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">While the current boosted the
subjects' recall of famous names, it did
not seem to affect their ability to identify famous landmarks. What is
it about people's names?</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">A person's name is an arbitrary,
"sparsely connected" bit of
information, said David Wolk, an assistant professor of neurology at
Penn, who collaborated with Olson on the study. A person's appearance
has nothing to do with the name picked by his parents.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">"There's nothing about a John Smith
that necessarily tells you anything
about who John Smith is," Wolk said.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">"Proper names," said Temple's Olson,
"are harder to remember than
almost every other category of things in the world."</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The effect of the stimulation was
short-lived. So Olson, somewhat in
jest, imagined a special hat outfitted with memory-stimulating
electrodes. More likely, she said, the technology might be used someday
by applying current while the person is learning new information - in
order to make it stick. She intends to study that possibility.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Meanwhile, scientists elsewhere have
found this type of stimulation can
temporarily boost memory in patients with Alzheimer's.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Olson acknowledges having difficulty
with names herself, though she
tries each semester to learn the names of dozens of new students.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Even without electricity, certain ones
stand out, she said:</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">"You always learn the names of the
best students and the worst
students."</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">

can stop blindness</span><br>

<div style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;<br>
</div>
<div style="text-align: center; margin-left: 80px; font-weight: bold;"><span
 style="font-style: italic;">Food
rich in magnesium reduced the risk of developing diabetic retinopathy,
glaucoma and cataracts. Also helps to combat aging and PMS.</span><br
 style="font-style: italic;">
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The food of the Brazilian is all
wrong. Only 17% of the population
consume the 400 grams recommended by WHO (World Health Organization) of
fruits, vegetables and greens, as surveyed by the Ministry of Health.
Outcome: no magnesium in our diet that protects the eyes and carries
out more 300 vital metabolic functions.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Just to give you an idea, a recent
study published in the British
Medical Journal shows that eating an extra portion and a half of green
vegetables, an important source of magnesium, reduces by 14% the risk
of contracting diabetes. A meta-analysis at the Institute of Metabolic
Science in Cambridge (UK) shows that a diet rich in magnesium lowers
blood pressure and the level of glucose in the blood. Therefore, it may
deter the development of diabetic retinopathy, a major cause of
blindness.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">According to the Institute
ophthalmologists, Penido Burnier and Leoncio
Queiroz Neto, the disease affects 75% of the 10 million Brazilians who
are diabetic and in most cases leads to loss of vision. Although
studies are not conclusive, the expert claims that the nutrient is
essential for eye health. For example, he says, it acts as a blocker of
calcium deposits on the inner walls of arteries. "These deposits cause
the formation of neovessels that hinder the nutrition of the retina and
leads to the death of its cells, the main characteristic of diabetic
retinopathy" he explains. In addition to preventing calcification of
arteries and vessels, he highlights, magnesium hinders the production
of a potent vasoconstrictor, endothelin-1. So, those who have a diet
low in magnesium are more likely to contract hypertension and primary
open-angle glaucoma, due to the lower blood flow to the head of the
optic nerve.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The problems of nutritional deficiency
do not stop there. The expert
says that magnesium helps the absorption of vitamins E, C and B,
essential nutrients for the health of the ocular tissues and other
organs. It also protects against oxidative stress that can cause early
cataracts, serious skin aging and the symptoms of PMS (premenstrual
tension) among women, he says.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Signs of Deficiency and Sources</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The main signs of magnesium deficit
are listed by the physician:</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">&middot; Tremor in hands or eyelids</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">&middot; Cramping and involuntary
movements in the face</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">&middot; Insomnia</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">&middot; Weakness</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">&middot; Tachycardia</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">&middot; Loss of appetite, nausea or
vomiting.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">He says these discomforts do not
appear simultaneously and may still be
associated with other health concerms. Adopting supplementation on your
own, should not even be considered. Queiroz Neto explains that the
absorption of magnesium and calcium are compete. Therefore, consumption
must be combined. Moreover, supplementation requires medical
supervision because excess can cause drops in blood pressure, changes
in bone calcification and respiratory problems.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The main sources of magnesium are:
leafy greens, seafood, nuts and
whole grains.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Diabetic retinopathy is seen only in
its advanced stages</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">There are no symptoms in its early
stages. Diabetic retinopathy is the
death of retinal cells, an ocular membrane eye where images are
processed. The specialist says that half of the patients seeking their
first consultation already have their visual acuity significantly
compromised. The problem, he says, is that you cannot recover lost
vision. To stop the evolution, it can be treated with laser
applications for drying neovascularization, administration of
anti-inflammatory drugs or surgery in more advanced cases.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Half of the glaucomatous lose vision
in one eye</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The glaucoma is also asymptomatic.
This makes the those affected have
similar behavior to that of patients affected by diabetic retinopathy.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">A disease characterized by loss of
visual field is the second leading
cause of blindness worldwide. The doctor says that the difficulty
occurs when the outflow of aqueous humor, the fluid that fills the
eyeball, causes the death of cells in the retina and optic nerve head.
"It is common in glaucomatous to make their first visit after having
lost sight in one eye or half of the axioms of the optic nerve that are
unrecoverable" he says. Treatment is done with eyedrops, laser
applications and, ultimately, surgery.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Cataracts can be associated with
habits</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Cataracts, the largest cause of
treatable blindness, is the clouding of
the lens, the natural lens of the eye responsible for focusing images
on the retina. It is generally associated with aging. According to him,
it may occur early due to nutritional deficiency, excessive sun
exposure or trauma. To eliminate the disease, the only treatment is
surgery that replaces the cloudy lens by an intraocular lens. Surgery
is more advanced in recent years. So much so that it now allows a
person over 60 years of age to see the same as another who is 20 years
old. The increase of glucose into the blood in patients with diabetes
makes the eyes become more vulnerable. To preserve vision, an
ophthalmologist should be consulted annually or whenever a change of
any type is perceived.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">

Terahertz Waves Tear Apart DNA</span><br>
</big></div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><br>
</div>
<div style="text-align: center; margin-left: 80px; font-weight: bold;"><span
 style="font-style: italic;">A
new model of the way the THz waves interact with DNA explains how the
damage is done and why evidence has been so hard to gather</span><br
 style="font-style: italic;">
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Great things are expected of terahertz
waves, the radiation that fills
the slot in the electromagnetic spectrum between microwaves and the
infrared. Terahertz waves pass through non-conducting materials such as
clothes , paper, wood and brick and so cameras sensitive to them can
peer inside envelopes, into living rooms and "frisk" people at distance.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The way terahertz waves are absorbed
and emitted can also be used to
determine the chemical composition of a material. And even though they
don't travel far inside the body, there is great hope that the waves
can be used to spot tumours near the surface of the skin.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">With all that potential, it's no
wonder that research on terahertz
waves has exploded in the last ten years or so.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">But what of the health effects of
terahertz waves? At first glance,
it's easy to dismiss any notion that they can be damaging. Terahertz
photons are not energetic enough to break chemical bonds or ionise
atoms or molecules, the chief reasons why higher energy photons such as
x-rays and UV rays are so bad for us. But could there be another
mechanism at work?</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The evidence that terahertz radiation
damages biological systems is
mixed. "Some studies reported significant genetic damage while others,
although similar, showed none," say Boian Alexandrov at the Center for
Nonlinear Studies at Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico and a
few buddies. Now these guys think they know why.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Alexandrov and co have created a model
to investigate how THz fields
interact with double-stranded DNA and what they've found is remarkable.
They say that although the forces generated are tiny, resonant effects
allow THz waves to unzip double-stranded DNA, creating bubbles in the
double strand that could significantly interfere with processes such as
gene expression and DNA replication. That's a jaw dropping conclusion.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">And it also explains why the evidence
has been so hard to garner.
Ordinary resonant effects are not powerful enough to do do this kind of
damage but nonlinear resonances can. These nonlinear instabilities are
much less likely to form which explains why the character of THz
genotoxic</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">effects are probabilistic rather than
deterministic, say the team.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">This should set the cat among the
pigeons. Of course, terahertz waves
are a natural part of environment, just like visible and infrared
light. But a new generation of cameras are set to appear that not only
record terahertz waves but also bombard us with them. And if our
exposure is set to increase, the question that urgently needs answering
is what level of terahertz exposure is safe.<br>

process in mice &#8211; now for humans</span></big><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
</div>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<div style="text-align: center;"><span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Harvard scientists were
surprised that they saw a dramatic reversal, not just a slowing down,
of the ageing in mice. Now they believe they might be able to
regenerate human organs</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
</div>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Ian
Sample, science correspondent</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
</div>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
 style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Scientists claim to be a step closer
to reversing the ageing process after rejuvenating worn out organs in
elderly mice. The experimental treatment developed by researchers at
the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, turned weak
and feeble old mice into healthy animals by regenerating their aged
bodies.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The surprise recovery of the animals
has raised hopes among scientists that it may be possible to achieve a
similar feat in humans &#8211; or at least to slow down the ageing process.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">An anti-ageing therapy could have a
dramatic impact on public health by reducing the burden of age-related
health problems, such as dementia, stroke and heart disease, and
prolonging the quality of life for an increasingly aged population.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">"What we saw in these animals was not
a slowing down or stabilisation of the ageing process. We saw a
dramatic reversal &#8211; and that was unexpected," said Ronald DePinho, who
led the study, which was published in the journal Nature.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">"This could lead to strategies that
enhance the regenerative potential of organs as individuals age and so
increase their quality of life. Whether it serves to increase longevity
is a question we are not yet in a position to answer."</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The ageing process is poorly
understood, but scientists know it is caused by many factors. Highly
reactive particles called free radicals are made naturally in the body
and cause damage to cells, while smoking, ultraviolet light and other
environmental factors contribute to ageing.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The Harvard group focused on a process
called telomere shortening. Most cells in the body contain 23 pairs of
chromosomes, which carry our DNA. At the ends of each chromosome is a
protective cap called a telomere. Each time a cell divides, the
telomeres are snipped shorter, until eventually they stop working and
the cell dies or goes into a suspended state called "senescence". The
process is behind much of the wear and tear associated with ageing.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">At Harvard, they bred genetically
manipulated mice that lacked an enzyme called telomerase that stops
telomeres getting shorter. Without the enzyme, the mice aged
prematurely and suffered ailments, including a poor sense of smell,
smaller brain size, infertility and damaged intestines and spleens. But
when DePinho gave the mice injections to reactivate the enzyme, it
repaired the damaged tissues and reversed the signs of ageing.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">"These were severely aged animals, but
after a month of treatment they showed a substantial restoration,
including the growth of new neurons in their brains," said DePinho.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Repeating the trick in humans will be
more difficult. Mice make telomerase throughout their lives, but the
enzyme is switched off in adult humans, an evolutionary compromise that
stops cells growing out of control and turning into cancer. Raising
levels of telomerase in people might slow the ageing process, but it
makes the risk of cancer soar.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">DePinho said the treatment might be
safe in humans if it were given periodically and only to younger people
who do not have tiny clumps of cancer cells already living, unnoticed,
in their bodies.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">David Kipling, who studies ageing at
Cardiff University, said: "The goal for human tissue 'rejuvenation'
would be to remove senescent cells, or else compensate for the
deleterious effects they have on tissues and organs. Although this is a
fascinating study, it must be remembered that mice are not little men,
particularly with regard to their telomeres, and it remains unclear
whether a similar telomerase reactivation in adult humans would lead to
the removal of senescent cells."</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Lynne Cox, a biochemist at Oxford
University, said the study was "extremely important" and "provides
proof of principle that short-term treatment to restore telomerase in
adults already showing age-related tissue degeneration can rejuvenate
aged tissues and restore physiological function."</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">DePinho said none of Harvard's mice
developed cancer after the treatment. The team is now investigating
whether it extends the lifespan of mice or enables them to live
healthier lives into old age.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Tom Kirkwood, director of the
Institute for Ageing and Health at Newcastle University, said: "The key
question is what might this mean for human therapies against
age-related diseases? While there is some evidence that telomere
erosion contributes to age-associated human pathology, it is surely not
the only, or even dominant, cause, as it appears to be in mice
engineered to lack telomerase. Furthermore, there is the ever-present
anxiety that telomerase reactivation is a hallmark of most human
cancers."</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><span

make cancer cells vanish<br>
</big></div>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Scottish scientists have made cancer
tumours vanish within 10 days by sending DNA to seek and destroy the
cells.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The system, developed at Strathclyde
and Glasgow universities, is being hailed as a breakthrough because it
appears to eradicate tumours without causing harmful side-effects. A
leading medical journal has described the results so far as remarkable,
while Cancer Research UK said they were encouraging.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Dr Christine Dufes, a lecturer at the
Strathclyde Institute of Pharmacy and Biomedical Sciences and leader of
the research, said: &#8220;The tumours were completely gone within 10 days.
It is fantastic. When you talk about 10 days that is the time frame for
curing a cold. Imagine if within 10 days you could completely make a
tumour disappear.&#8221;</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Researchers around the world are
trying to find ways to use genes as a cancer treatment, but one problem
is ensuring they attack the tumour without destroying healthy tissue.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">In laboratory experiments the
Strathclyde research team used a plasma protein called transferrin,
which carries iron through the blood, to deliver the therapeutic DNA to
the right spot. Once in situ the DNA produced a protein that attacked
the tumour cells.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The findings have been published in
the Journal of Controlled Release, with an accompanying comment from
editor Professor Kinam Park, of Purdue University, Indiana, saying
other attempts to target genes at cancer cells have &#8220;seldom shown
complete disappearance of tumours&#8221;.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The research was initially supported
with a grant from charity Tenovus Scotland, which supports the work of
young scientists to help their ideas get off the ground.</span><br

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Abstract -- Various polymers,
including cationic polyamine polymers and dendrimeric polymers, are
shown to possess anti-proliferative activity, and may therefore be
useful for treatment of disorders characterised by undesirable cellular
proliferation such as neoplasms and tumours, inflammatory disorders
(including autoimmune disorders), psoriasis and atherosclerosis. The
polymers may be used alone as active agents, or as delivery vehicles
for other therapeutic agents, such as drug molecules or nucleic acids
for gene therapy. In such cases, the polymers' own intrinsic
anti-tumour activity may complement the activity of the agent to be
delivered. </span><br>

<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The White House says the BP oil spill
is probably the greatest
environmental disaster the US has faced, but the true impact on
surrounding ecosystems could take months or even years to emerge.
Experts say the unprecedented depth of the spill, combined with the use
of chemicals that broke the oil down before it reached the surface,
pose an unknown threat.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">"It's difficult to marshal resources
to do a thorough job of charting
what the impacts are," Jeffrey Short, an environmental chemist who
worked on the effects of the Exxon Valdez spill, told Nature magazine.
"It's especially difficult when weird things happen to catch the
scientific community bysurprise. That's clearly the case here."</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Louisiana, the nearest state to the
leaking well, some 42 miles
offshore, has been the most impacted. The state's governor, Bobby
Jindal, said more than 100 miles of its 400-mile coast had so far been
polluted.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">State officials have reported sheets
of oil soiling wetlands and
seeping into marine and bird nurseries, leaving a stain of sticky crude
on cane that binds the marshes together. Billy Nungesser, president of
Plaquemines parish, said he had seen dying cane and "no life" in parts
of Pass-a-Loutre wildlife refuge.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Oil debris, in the form of tar balls
and surface sheen, has also been
reported ashore in outlying parts of coastal Mississippi and Alabama.
Tar balls found on Florida beaches a fortnight ago did not come from
the BP spill, tests showed.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">A quarter of US waters in the Gulf of
Mexico are closed to fishing,
hitting the livelihoods of shrimpers, oyster-catchers and charter boat
operators. "Every fish and invertebrate contacting the oil is probably
dying. I have no doubt about that," said Prosanta Chakrabarty, a
Louisiana State University fish biologist.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">In the six weeks since the explosion
that killed 11 workers and started
the leak, wildlife officials say at least 491 birds, 227 turtles and 27
mammals, including dolphins, have been found dead along the US Gulf
coast. Many of these were not related to the spill; only 28 of the dead
birds were covered in oil. More marine creatures, including birds and
mammals will be affected by surface oil, and scientists are also
concerned about possible underwater clouds of dispersed oil.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Researchers say they have found at
least two sprawling underwater
plumes of what appear to be oil or oil derivatives, each hundreds of
metres deep and stretching for miles. A plume reported last week by a
team from the University of South Florida was headed toward the
continental shelf off the Alabama coastline, waters thick with fish and
other marine life.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">No major fish kills have yet been
reported, but federal officials said
the impacts could take years to unfold. "This is just a giant
experiment going on and we're trying to understand scientifically what
this means," said Roger Helm, a senior official with the US Fish and
Wildlife Service.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">David Hollander, an oceanographer at
the University of South Florida
who helped discover one of the plumes, said: "It may be due to the
application of the dispersants that a portion of the petroleum has
extracted itself from the crude and is now incorporated into the waters
with solvents and detergents."</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">He said there could be knock-on
impacts on organisms further up the
food chain. "We think there could be both short-term and long-term
implications."</span><br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">DaoChi Energy of Arizona, Inc. (div.
Williamson Information
Technologies Corp.), the developer of a breakthrough combinations of
existing technology to transform waste streams into liquid fuels,
announced today the filing of its first patent application.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The patent application, &#8220;Apparatus for
Cultivation of Phytoplankton and
Other Aquatic Species&#8221; details DaoChi Energy of Arizona's invention of
a method to cultivate algae with a high concentration of volume
efficiency, without requiring expensive or elaborate artificial
lighting systems, and without expensive cast acrylic tubing or delicate
polythene bag systems.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The process of designing a
concentrated cultivation system was just an
exercise in applied geometry in the opinion of company president
Stafford &#8220;Doc&#8221; Williamson. &#8220;I know that every tenth grader moans, &#8216;What
am I ever going to use this for?&#8217; when they first are forced to face
basic geometry lessons,&#8221; says &#8220;Doc&#8221; Williamson including an imitation
of a whining teen, &#8220;But here we are, doing nothing but increasing the
exposed surface of a regular solid so that light can penetrate a few
inches, and it just might change the world.&#8221;</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Nutrients and the carbon dioxide
necessary for the phenomenal growth
rates of algae (many species can double in weight and volume in less
than 24 hours, some as often as 4 times a day under ideal conditions)
bubble through the liquid in this apparatus much as air does in a home
aquarium. Indeed the device looks quite similar to a giant home
aquarium in its basic rectangular form, though the mirrors and baffles
and harvesting hoist hint at Dr. Frankenstein&#8217;s lab equipment.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Each growth tank is entirely separate;
isolating each batch from every
other batch. There are no circulating elements, and thus the isolation
reduces the risk of total colony collapse. The patent application does
describe possibly using &#8220;concentrating mirrors&#8221; to bring sunlight from
outside. Transparent tank designs are intended for indoor use, outdoor
placements are possible in suitable climates with potentially opaque or
translucent side panels.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Nothing here is custom made.
Everything is off-the-shelf, from the
transparent plexi panels, to the manual pulley hoist overhead,
everything can be bought in your local hardware store the DaoChi Energy
executive claims. &#8220;We have no idea how cheaply you could build these if
you were creating several acres worth,&#8221; &#8220;Doc&#8221; Williamson said referring
to the contrasting complexity of valves and miles of tubing required
for most of the polythene bag algae cultivation systems. &#8220;With our
concentration factor, we know we can achieve the same production
capacity as an acre of raceways or shallow ponds in one fifth to one
tenth the space.&#8221;</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">DaoChi Energy&#8217;s President, Stafford
&#8220;Doc&#8221; Williamson, says that they
are hopeful that using high frequency sound waves to burst the algae
cell walls and again in the separation and settling process will spur
immediate developments in the field, using &#8220;the most promising source
of renewable oil, algae, which can be a real challenger to the
petroleum monopoly on fuels.&#8221;</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">DaoChi Energy of Arizona&#8217;s latest
invention expands on the company&#8217;s
plans for waste to fuel production facilities using various
technologies to convert civilizations&#8217; huge and problematic quantities
of municipal and sewage wastes into valued resource streams, the
development of which will be the fulfillment of many people&#8217;s dreams of
a fully re-cycling society across the entire globe. The DaoChi Energy
algae cultivation system can be stand-alone, or built adjacent to a
&#8220;smokestack&#8221; facility (smelter, power plant, etc.) for the effect of
carbon sequestration of flue gases where such &#8220;rich&#8221; sources of carbon
dioxide can promote the kind of geometric progression pattern of
extremely rapid growth. &#8220;It seems like a miracle, but it is just a
fact. If you have a colony of 100 tons of algae, feed it with plenty of
carbon dioxide, literally overnight you can have 200 to 400 tons of
algae, meaning you can remove 100 to 300 tons daily from this operation
and starting again from the remaining 100 tons the next day the same
thing happens,&#8221; gushes Stafford &#8220;Doc&#8221; Williamson with unbridled
enthusiasm.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">

<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">DaoChi Energy of Arizona, Inc. is
developing a breakthrough
technologies that will transform algae, the most promising source of
renewable oil, and enable the recovery and re-use of waste streams from
city municipal solid waste and sewage sludge into energy. By keeping
the sources of carbon for fuels to only those which are already part of
the organic cycles that already exist in the environment, we can reduce
and eventually reverse the trend toward global climate change as we
stop adding to the carbon load of the earth&#8217;s atmosphere. Because these
waste streams are constantly being produced (and can be supplemented
with algae cultivation as part of the sewage processing, and carbon
dioxide sequestration) they provide an endless supply from which we can
obtain new oils that can be used for many products such as diesel,
gasoline, jet fuel, plastics and solvents without the global warming
effects of petroleum and its fossil sources of carbon. DaoChi (which
means &#8220;the way of energy in harmony&#8221;) technology is aimed at

</div>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Russian researchers developed an
express-technique for testing toxicity of water with high and low
deuterium concentration and discovered an interesting fact &#8211; deuterium
is a crucial element for normal functioning of a living cell.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Natural water normally contains two
hydrogen isotopes: protium and deuterium, which concentration is about
156 parts per million (ppm). Light water (with low deuterium
concentration) is believed to have positive effects on human health.
Heavy water is toxic &#8211; it prevents cells from normal division, if its
concentration in an organism is about 25-50%.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Scientists suggested using a test
organism, an infusorium Spirostomum ambiguum, which is very convenient
to work with due to its size &#8211; about 1 mm. Experiments showed that
deuterium concentration of 50-125 ppm had no effect on infusoria
lifespan, but organisms had quickly died in water with lower or higher
deuterium content. Researchers believe that some certain deuterium
content is crucial for normal functioning of a living cell.</span><br>

 style="font-weight: bold;">
</div>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Russian Institute for Biological
Medicine launched production of light water, differing from ordinary
water by stimulating all human systems&#8217; activities through data-flow
level. Institute&#8217;s vice-president claims such developments are unique
and cannot be found anywhere else in the world.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Natural light water is found in
mountain rivers and melting glaciers. Scientists designed rectifying
columns for water fractional distillation and derived water free from
its heavy components.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Light water normalizes any pathology
found in an organism. It also improves body resistance to harmful
effects of physical, chemical and biological origin. Clinical trials
revealed light water&#8217;s ability to dissolve higher concentrations of
various substances and to penetrate membranes easier than ordinary
water. Light water showed anti-inflammatory effect and eliminated
tissue puffiness.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Recently developed &#8220;Langway&#8221; water is
already available at the US market. Tests proved its potential to
refine cell metabolic processes through accumulating energy inside a
cell. Light water is highly recommended for skin regeneration
stimulation. &#8220;Langway&#8221; tones the skin, reduces its greasiness, narrows
skin pores, slows ageing and helps skin to resist negative
environmental impact. Light water also regulates excretion of toxins,
salts of heavy metals, cellular debris and infectious germs. Another
positive aspect is that such water lowers blood sugar and cholesterol,
thus it can be recommended for patients, suffering from diabetes,
atherosclerosis, obesity and hypertension.</span><br

THE USE OF PROTEOLYTIC (PANCREATIC) ENZYME TREATMENT</span><br

</div>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">At the turn of the century, an
embryologist at the University of Edinburgh, named John Beard was
studying placentas. He noted that in every species, as the placenta
grows in the uterus, it invades like a tumor. Beard wondered exactly
what prevented a normal placenta from growing into a cancer. He
discovered that the placenta stopped growing the day the fetal pancreas
started working. First came the co-relation; then came the leap of
faith. The embryologist figured that if the pancreatic enzymes could
halt placental growth, they might just work against cancerous tumors as
well; but Beard&#8217;s theory was largely forgotten.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Note by J. Buche, ND, on the effect of
pancreatic enzymes</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"> on cancerous
tumors</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">"The effect of pancreatic enzymes on
tumors was first explained in The Enzyme Treatment of Cancer and Its
Scientific Basis by Scottish professor John Beard, DSc, in 1911.
Cancerous tumors grow by producing an enzyme called malignin that
digests left-handed, living protein such as human tissue. As tumors
grow, malignin production increases, which promotes more cancer growth.
Malignin is the mirror image of the pancreatic enzyme Trypsin. Trypsin
breaks down right-handed living tissue, including tumor mass. According
to Dr. Kelley, "Large quantities of Trypsin in the bloodstream stop
Malignin's acceleration of tumor growth. Also, the non-growing tumor
can now be recognized by the human body's defensive warriors, white
blood cells and antibodies. These defensive warriors engulf the
liquefied, dead non-growing tumor debris from the digestive activity of
the enzyme Trypsin." He says that other enzymes are needed to break
down the starch capsule that surrounds a tumor and the intermediate
proteins that are created as Trypsin liquefies the mass. Dr. Kelley
says that the combination of pancreatic enzymes in the Kelley Metabolic
Program "destroy and strip away about 97% of such starch capsules,
thereby enabling tumors to be recognized, digested, liquefied and
removed from persons' bodies via their bloodstreams."</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
Over 93% of the cancer patients who strictly adhere to the Kelley
Metabolic Program for at least 6 months have seen their malignancies
disappear, according to Dr. Kelley's records. For some patients, it
takes 18 months or longer before they are free of cancer. Dr. Kelley
emphasizes that the diet change and pancreatic support must be
continued even after the cancer has disappeared if the person wants to
remain healthy.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">

<br>
<div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-style: italic;">94%
of tumors found using urine samples in early U.S. study</span><br
 style="font-style: italic;">
</div>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">BOSTON Researchers have developed a
simple urine test that appears to detect breast cancer early and
accurately track tumor growth.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The findings are still preliminary,
but if further research supports them, the test could be a major
advance in the effort to catch breast cancer before it turns deadly.
The scientists, who work for Harvard University at Children's Hospital
Boston, are searching for similar markers in urine for other cancers.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Earlier this year, a team at the
National Cancer Institute reported that other tumors, including
prostate cancer, may also be detectable with urine tests. That would be
more convenient and inexpensive than the scans, blood tests and
biopsies commonly used to screen for and diagnose cancers. Scientists
say a screening test that found cancer without needle jabs, intrusive
scopes, surgery or radiation would be widely used, improving the odds
that tumors would be seen before they spread to other organs, when they
are most treatable and least dangerous.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Breast tumors are typically found with
a mammogram, a type of X-ray, or when they become large enough to be
felt by a woman or her doctor. By then, they may have spread. Further,
almost half of women do not get annual mammograms. The result is that
37 percent of breast cancers are diagnosed after they have spread,
according to the American Cancer Society.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The society estimates that 215,000 new
breast cancer cases will be reported this year in the United States and
that about 40,000 women will die of the disease.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Children's Hospital researchers
evaluated their new test, which identifies the presence of an enzyme
called ADAM 12, in experiments using urine samples from 71 women known
to have breast cancer, from early to late stages. The test successfully
identified 67, or 94 percent, of the cases. In a control population of
46 women without cancer, there were seven false positive results, or 15
percent. In these seven women, the amounts of the telltale enzyme were
very low, the researchers said. The findings have been accepted for
publication in the Journal of Biological Chemistry.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">"Our data demonstrate for the first
time that ADAM 12 can be detected in the urine of breast cancer
patients," Marsha Moses, Roopali Roy and their associates wrote in the
paper. "Increased urinary levels of this protein correlate with breast
cancer progression."</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">If the results can be repeated in a
larger group of patients, the urine test would offer the first
noninvasive way to detect breast cancer early, monitor a tumor as it
expands, and perhaps keep track of how well treatment is working.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The Harvard research team focused on
urine as a place to seek early evidence of cancer, Moses said, because
"I wanted something that was noninvasive," a simple, painless and
reliable test that accurately warns when tumor growth is getting under
way.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Her goal is to offer a test kit that
doctors can use routinely in their offices and in hospital
laboratories. Eventually, she hoped the test could be done at home. She
said that a test could be available within a few years.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">"This is important and exciting work,"
said Dr. Catherine Park, a cancer specialist at the University of
California at San Francisco, because it may link an enzyme that plays a
role in the growth of a tumor with a detectable measure of how fast the
tumor is expanding. She added that it remained to be seen whether the
urine test would be accurate enough to provide a "black-and-white
answer."</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Dr. Sudhir Srivastava, chief of
biomarkers research at the National Cancer Institute, said that until
more research is done, ADAM 12 must be considered "a putative marker,
those that are just at the discovery stage and need to be validated
with proper studies."</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Noting the small number of patients
studied by the researchers, he added, "At this point it looks
promising, but it's not ready for prime time."</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">He said it was surprising that a
cancer biomarker, or chemical signal, would be found in urine. The
kidneys and liver tend to remove such enzymes and molecules.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Srivastava's program is spending $23
million this year to find cancer biomarkers, including those in urine.
National Cancer Institute colleagues reported in February in the
Journal of Clinical Oncology evidence that prostate cancer is also
detectable with urine tests. The team, working with the Children's
Hospital and Harvard scientists, found two biomarkers in urine that
seemed to predict the return of cancer in patients who had undergone
treatment for prostate cancer.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The urine test for breast cancer seems
to identify patients with tumors and also warns of a tumor's severity,
distinguishing among patients in varying stages of cancer.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Moses said her experiments showed that
when the amount of ADAM 12 in urine spikes sharply, the tumor may be
entering a more dangerous growth phase. As a breast tumor gets bigger,
and begins sending its deadly "seeds" to lymph nodes and various
organs, the enzyme level increases. Moses said the warning's accuracy
may improve if ADAM 12 can be combined with other biomarkers in the
urine that her lab is studying.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The ADAM 12 enzyme "is a member of a
family of enzymes that were only recently discovered," Moses said.
"Some of them are associated with cancer, but in general their
functions are not well established."</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">ADAM 12 is suspected of playing a role
in remodeling a structure called the extracellular matrix, a cagelike
environment in which each cell lives. It helps the cell see and feel
its neighbors, helps anchor the cell in place, and facilitates the flow
of chemical signals, food and waste into and out of the cell. This
structure seems to change constantly to meet the cell's needs, and
levels of ADAM 12 may increase, Moses said, when it is changing the
extracellular matrix, perhaps to allow the expanding tumor to push
through surrounding tissues, or to draw in new blood vessels it needs
for growth.</span> <br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Most people are unaware that there is
a reliable, scientifically proven laboratory blood test for detecting
over 99% of all cancers. "Why haven't the doctors I see ordered this
test?" people often ask me. Good question. I can only answer that this
is yet another example of the resistance to innovative change that the

antibody in serum." The test is extremely sensitive; blood levels of
this antibody rise early in the course of the vast majority of cancers
of all types, regardless of location in the body. The test is
especially useful when cancer is suspected but has not been confirmed
by a biopsy.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">One study involving the test was
published in the journal Cancer Detection and Prevention in 1994. In
125 patients and controls, 118 were subsequently diagnosed by the time
the article was published. In 21 individuals who were subsequently
proven to have cancer, the AMAS test was elevated. The test was normal
in 94, none of whom were shown to have cancer. In three other subjects
who did not have cancer, the test was elevated when first done but a
second test was normal. The other seven subjects had positive AMAS
tests but remained undiagnosed at the time of the article, but all
showed symptoms of cancer that likely indicated its presence.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The study was consistent with other
published tests that indicate that the AMAS test is over 95% reliable
on the first test, and over 99% reliable when a repeat test is
performed. The test is a standardized, validated assay, developed over
15 years ago by Peter Bogovich, M.D., Ph.D. Dr. Bogovich has conducted
scores of studies and published widely on the test.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Another study published in the Journal
of Cellular Biochemistry in 1994 stated that levels typically rise with
age and are higher in individuals at high risk for cancer because of
family history, but stay within normal levels even when benign growths
occur. "We demonstrated that the concentration is most markedly
increased within weeks of the occurrence of malignant transformation to
clinical breast cancer," these researchers wrote. This study involved
breast cancer, but the test is valid for all cancer types. Other
researchers have written that the test is an excellent screening method.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The AMAS test also is useful in
monitoring the treatment of malignancies. Levels typically return to
normal within two to three months of successful treatment. Other
biological markers in the blood are much less specific and are usually
not elevated early in the course of disease or recurrence. Thus the
AMAS test is an excellent way to screen for and detect cancer or
recurrences, and to track treatment progress during treatment.
Conventional cancer treatment authorities are committed to a host of
expensive but highly profitable diagnostic (and treatment) techniques
(mammograms, MRIs, gastrointestinal series, etc.). Were it not for the
intransigence of established authorities, the AMAS test undoubtedly
would be much more widely used.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">

Less Than The Cost Of A Night At The Movies</span></big><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
</div>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">By <br>
Kelley Eidem</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
</div>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Can stage 4 cancer really be easy to
cure?</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">I'm the author of the book The Doctor
Who Cures Cancer, but today I'd like to talk to you about my easy
victory over my own Stage 4 cancer.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The truth is that I was only able to
come up with a key part of this extremely simple cure from what I
learned from writing the book...</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Please forgive me in advance because
I'm going to be talking about cancer in ways that are going to be quite
different than the types of discussions you've heard before on this
topic.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">And please bear with me if at times it
looks like the discussion has gone into areas that don't fit
conventional wisdom. Going outside the box of what we think we know
might be the best way at this point to get to a cure.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">For several decades, modern medicine
has tried a lot of toxic compounds, hoping to 'out-toxic' the cancer.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">And sure enough, the compounds did
out-toxic cancer. Unfortunately, it usually out-toxics the patient as
well.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The result has been that cancer
treatments are usually an expensive, painful and scary proposition. But
you already knew that.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">I didn't go bald or get sick to my
stomach!</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Fortunately, my Stage 4 cancer was
none of the above for me. My advanced cancer treatment cost less than
two tickets and popcorn at the movies.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">My treatment wasn't painful. And I
wasn't scared...I didn't lose a minute's sleep...because I knew what to
do.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">If we've learned anything about
treating cancer in the last 50 to 60 years it has to be this: half
killing the patient isn't half way successful.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">As I emphatically told a woman in my
store recently, "You gotta be healthy to get well!"</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">In my own case, I knew by the many
lesions I had that I was already sick. I didn't need someone to help
make me sicker. I needed to get healthy, so I could get well.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">UCLA Researchers Confirm My Method!</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Maybe the best place to start with
this would be to let you know that researchers at UCLA garnered lots of
headlines two years ago because they had done something pretty
incredible. (1)</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">What had the UCLA researchers done?
They shrank tumors by 80% with the heat from habaneros peppers. That is
quite extraordinary in terms of what is usually accomplished with toxic
drugs.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">It's also worth noting that in the US
the State of New Mexico has the lowest cancer mortality rate of all 50
states. They probably eat more peppers in New Mexico per capita than
all the other states, too.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">In other words, the researchers at
UCLA made a great choice in examining the anti-cancer properties of hot
peppers.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">My own success in curing myself with
habaneros peppers preceded the UCLA researchers by seven years. And I
didn't shrink my many tumors by 80%...I shrank them 100%.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">UCLA's research results did confirm
that my own method was an extremely powerful weapon against cancer. I'm
eternally grateful for their confirmation.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">But then, I used habaneros peppers
PLUS two more low tech ingredients...running rings around the findings
made by the UCLA guys and gals.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">(By the way, if you absolutely can't
tolerate peppers, you can substitute freshly grated ginger...grated
daily...not from a jar!)</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Research from the Universities of
Michigan and Minnesota just scratch the surface of ginger's power
against cancer. Not only does ginger cause cancer cell death, it also
makes the cancer cells turn on themselves. Speaking technically, that
means the tumors go away. (2) (3)</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">I Had Lesions From Top To Toe</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Well, almost.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Let me start from the beginning. One
morning as I was about to step into the shower, I noticed a couple of
large round looking red splotches on my thigh and calf. They were about
the size of a half dollar.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">I wasn't sure what to make of them,
but they stood out like crazy. By the next day, the two red lesions had
turned brown. Only they were now accompanied by several more large red
splotches.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Some were on my upper back, lower
back, hips, thighs and calves on both sides of my body. Within 24
hours, they turned brown, too.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">At this point, most people would
probably have freaked out. I had a darn good reason not to, however. I
couple years earlier, I had written a book entitled The Doctor Who
Cures Cancer.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Gathering the research for the book
gave me some critically important information that helped me to develop
my own method.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">I figured, if what I had was cancer,
that's not a problem because curing cancer isn't as difficult as we've
been led to believe.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">No, I wasn't pregnant!</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Many years earlier, I'd also learned
that the common pregnancy tests sold in drug stores will sometimes
produce a positive result if the person taking the test has cancer.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">A call to the makers of one of the
products confirmed that this is true: pregnancy screening tests can
sometimes pick up the presence of cancer. It is well known among
physicians that home pregnancy tests can show a false positive for
pregnancy when the person being tested has cancer.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The test isn't real accurate if the
result is negative because the test kit requires that a high threshold
be met before the test will read positive.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Pregnant women easily reach the
threshold, but a person with cancer doesn't necessarily produce enough
of the hormone to register on the test kit.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">But if the kit does show "positive" in
a non-pregnant person, it is highly accurate for uncovering cancer.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">It seemed to me that it was worth a
shot as a screening mechanism. Since I am a male, a positive test
result would tell me what I needed to know.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">I did the test, and sure enough, the
'pregnancy' test result came up positive. You might be wondering why a
pregnancy test would read positive.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">I'm glad you asked. ;-) Pregnancy
tests screen for the presence of a hormone called HCGH (human chorionic
gonaditrophin hormone.)</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">It's the same hormone that is elevated
in cancer patients. But in most cases the level in cancer patients
aren't high enough to trigger a positive test result.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Down below will be listed information
on a more sophisticated pregnancy test that's about 97% accurate for
detecting cancer. I'll tell you more about that test in a minute.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Pregnancy kit 'says' I'm pregnant!</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">In my case, my HCGH was high enough to
score positive on the test. So there I was, a man, with more than a
dozen large lesions AND a positive pregnancy test result!</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">There was no point for me to go to a
physician at that point, because (a) I had no insurance, and far more
importantly, (b) chemo sucks in treating solid mass tumors, and I had
more than a dozen visible tumors! There's no telling how many tumors
there might have been hidden within my body.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Then there was reason (C) for not
going to see a physician!!! The first thing the doctor would have
wanted to do would be to cut out a portion of one of the lesions to
have it examined by a pathologist.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">I had learned something profound when
writing The Doctor Who Cures Cancer which was later confirmed in a book
about Judah Folkman, M.D., (inventor of Angiostatin) that the act of
cutting out a portion of a tumor activates more tumors to sprout wings.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Stage 4 cancer cure, Part 2</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">It seemed to me that there were too
many tumors raging already to let anyone cut on me spurring further
growth.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Here's a real brief recipe list here.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">(1) Grate one habaneros pepper each
day, putting it on bread (2) Grate two cloves of garlic each day,
putting them on bread (3) 1-2 Tablespoons of Emulsified cod liver oil
each day.* TwinLabs makes some wonderfully flavored cod liver oil.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">I used the cod liver oil because I was
not losing any weight or dealing with fluid retention. If I had either
of those conditions, I would have used evening primrose oil or borage
oil instead of the emulsified cod liver oil.*</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">(4)Smother the grated garlic and
habaneros peppers with real butter and eat it. No margarines of any
type, including Smart Balance, etc.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">That's it!</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">* The best way to determine which oil
I would use can be determined easily if there is pain. In fact there
are two ways. One way would be to drink a cup of black coffee with two
boiled eggs. (boiled only.) If that made me feel worse, I'd take 1 or 2
tablespoons of emulsified cod liver oil. If the coffee and eggs made me
feel better, I'd take 6,000 mgs of borage oil or evening primrose oil.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The potent active ingredients from the
peppers and the garlic disperse quickly. So they must be grated each
day, and eaten immediately.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The sophisticated test was developed
by a Philippine Dr. Manuel D. Navarro in the late 1950's! His son, Dr.
Efren Navarro, continues to analyze the test results. The test is
called the "HCG Urine Immunoassay."</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">This HCG test can find cancer 12 to 27
months before other kinds of testing depending on the type of cancer.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">When I checked into this two years
ago, the test cost about $50. To find out more, call Erlinda Suarez at
(847) 359-3634.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The address is 631 Peregrine Dr.,
Palatine, IL 60067.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Please be aware that the turn around
time for the test is about 10 days.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The best to you.</span><br

 style="font-weight: bold;">Can you&nbsp; tell when you are in a
hotel room, restroom,&nbsp; motel etc. with a mirror whether it is in
fact a&nbsp; mirror or 2-way&nbsp; glass? </span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
</big></div>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp; </span><br

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Here's&nbsp;&nbsp;
how:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">I thought it was quite
interesting!&nbsp;&nbsp; And I know in about 30 seconds you're
going&nbsp; do what I did and find the nearest mirror.&nbsp; Do you
know how to determine if a mirror is&nbsp; 2-way or not?&nbsp; This is
not to scare you,&nbsp; but to make you aware. A policewoman who&nbsp;
travels all over the&nbsp;&nbsp; U.S. and gives&nbsp; seminars and
techniques for businesswomen&nbsp; passed this one on.&nbsp; When we
visit&nbsp; toilets, bathrooms, hotel rooms, changing rooms,&nbsp;
etc., how many of you know for sure that&nbsp; the seemingly ordinary
mirror hanging on the&nbsp; wall is a real mirror, or actually a&nbsp;
2-way mirror (i.e., they can see you, but&nbsp; you can't see them)?
There have been many&nbsp; cases of people installing 2-way mirrors
in&nbsp; female changing rooms. It is very&nbsp; difficult to
positively&nbsp; identify the surface by just looking at&nbsp; it. So,
how do we determine with any amount&nbsp; of certainty what type of
mirror we are looking&nbsp; at? Just conduct this&nbsp; simple test -</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Test:&nbsp; Place the&nbsp; tip of
your fingernail against the reflective&nbsp; surface and if there is a
GAP between&nbsp; your fingernail and the image of the nail,&nbsp; then
it is a GENUINE mirror. However, if your&nbsp; fingernail DIRECTLY
TOUCHES the image of your&nbsp; nail, then BEWARE, FOR IT IS A
2-WAY&nbsp; MIRROR! </span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">"No Space.&nbsp; Leave the&nbsp;
Place!"&nbsp; So remember, every time you see a&nbsp; Mirror, do the
"fingernail test."&nbsp; It&nbsp; doesn't cost you
anything.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><br style="font-weight: bold;">

Inconvenient truths about our evolution?</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
</big></div>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">A controversial
scientist claims he can shed light on human behaviour. But not everyone
will like his theories, says Jeremy Laurance</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Why do beautiful people have more
daughters? Because beauty is more important for a woman than a man,
according to evolutionary psychologist Satoshi Kanazawa.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Why are most suicide bombers Muslim?
Because they don't get enough sex. Why are liberals more intelligent
than conservatives? Because liberalism is "evolutionarily novel."</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The London School of Economics
researcher and author of Ten Politically Incorrect Truths about Human
Nature is accustomed to defending his provocative assertions against
outraged critics.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">He acknowledges that some of his ideas
may seem "immoral, contrary to our ideals or offensive". But he insists
they are true and supported by scientific evidence that he has
continued to collect since his book was published in 2007. "Like it or
not, human nature is simply not politically correct," he says.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Now, in a study to be published in
<span style="font-style: italic;">Reproductive Sciences</span>, he has
adduced new evidence for what he
describes as one of the most celebrated principles in evolutionary
biology which explains why attractive people have more female children.
So how does the research stack up?</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">1 Beautiful
people have more daughters</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Known as the Trivers-Willard
hypothesis this states that if parents have any traits they can pass on
to their children and that will be better for one sex than the other,
they they will have more children of that sex.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">A man's value as a mate is largely
determined in evolutionary terms by his wealth, status and power,
according to Dr Kanazawa, whereas a woman's is largely determined by
her youth and physical attractiveness.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">"Physical attractiveness, while a
universally positive quality, contributes even more to women's
reproductive success than to men's. The hypothesis would therefore
predict that physically attractive parents should have more daughters
than sons," Dr Kanazawa writes.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">

Development Study of 17,000 babies who were rated for attractiveness by
their teachers at age 7 and were asked at age 45 for the age and sex of
their babies bears this out. The unattractive children were more likely
to have sons, according to the Reproductive Sciences study.</span><br

<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">2 Liberals are
more intelligent than conservatives</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">A study by Dr Kanazawa, published in
Social Science Quarterly in March, based on the same data showed that
young adults who identified themselves as "very liberal" had an average
IQ of 106 while those who identified themselves as "very conservative"
had an average IQ of 95.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">"The ability to think and reason
endowed our ancestors with advantages in solving evolutionarily novel
problems for which they did not have innate solutions. As a result,
more intelligent people are more likely to recognise and understand
such novel entities and situations than less intelligent people, and
some of these entities and situations are preferences, values, and
lifestyles," Dr Kanazawa said.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Humans are evolutionarily designed to
be conservative, caring mostly about their family and friends. Being
liberal and caring about an indefinite number of genetically unrelated
strangers is evolutionarily novel. So more intelligent children may be
more likely to grow up to be liberals.</span><br

<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">3 Most suicide
bombers are Muslim</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Suicide missions are not always
religiously motivated. But when religion is involved it is always
Muslim, Dr Kanazawa says.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Why? The surprising answer is that it
may have nothing to do with Islam or politics, culture or race. Rather,
it has to do with sex, or in this case the absence of sex.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Writing in Psychology Today, Dr
Kanazawa said the distinguishing feature of Islam was that it tolerated
polygyny &#8211; men taking two or more wives at the same time. By allowing
some men to monopolise all women other men were left out. The prospect
of 72 virgins waiting in heaven for any martyr to Islam then created a
potent cocktail. "It is the combination of polygyny and the promise of
a large harem of virgins in heaven that motivates many young Muslim
suicide bombers," he says.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">4 Men like
blonde bombshells (and women want to look like them)</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Blonde hair is unique in that it
changes dramatically with age, Dr Kanazawa says. Typically, young girls
with light blonde hair become women with brown hair. So blonde hair is
a signal of youth and men who attempt to mate with blondes are
unconsciously seeking younger (and hence healthier and more fecund)
women.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">5 Humans are
naturally polygamous</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Polyandry (one woman married to more
than one man) is rare but polygyny has been widely practised throughout
most of history.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">In societies where rich men are much
richer than poor men, women and their children are better off having a
share of the few wealthy men than having an entire poor man to
themselves. In practice, most industrial societies tend to be
monogamous because men tend to be more equal in their resources than
their ancestors in medieval times.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">6 Having sons
reduces the likelihood of divorce</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">A man's value as a mate is largely
determined by his wealth, status and power whereas a woman's comes
mainly from her youth and physical attractiveness. A father is
important to his son in ensuring he inherits wealth status and power
but he can do little to keep his daughter youthful or beautiful. His
continued presence in the family is important to the son but not as
crucial to his daughter.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">

geniuses have in common with criminals</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The tendency to commit crimes peaks in
adolescence and then rapidly declines. But this curve is not limited to
crime &#8211; it is also evident in every quantifiable human behaviour that
is seen by potential mates and costly (not affordable by all sexual
competitors). In the competition for mates men may act violently or
they may express their competitiveness through their creative
activities.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">8 The myth of
the male mid-life crisis</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Many middle aged men go through a
mid-life crisis but not because they are middle aged. It is because
their wives are. Dr Kanazawa says: "From the evolutionary
psychologist's perspective, a man's midlife crisis is precipitated by
his wife's imminent menopause and end of her reproductive career and
thus his renewed need to attract younger women."</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">9 It's natural
for male politicians to risk everything for an affair</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Powerful men have always married
monogamously but mated polygynously. Men strive to attain political
power, consciously or unconsciously, in order to have reproductive
access to a large number of women.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">10 Men sexually
harass women because they are not sexist</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Men always subjected each other to
abusive, intimidating and degrading treatment at work. It is part of
their reaction to competitive situations. Men are not treating women
differently when they harass them. They do it because they are not
discriminating, Dr Kanazawa says. </span><br style="font-weight: bold;">

<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">A SMALL firm in the Borders is hoping
to solve the problems of Scotland's dirty hospital wards with its
"magic water" product, designed to kill hard-to-beat bugs such as MRSA
and Clostridium difficile.<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">Duns-based Aqualution is in
talks with Aberdeen University School of Medicine to test its invention
- which uses electrodialysed salt water - for effectiveness in wound
cleaning and healing.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The magic water solution, a biocide
called Hypochlorous acid, has already been used successfully in Bupa
care homes and has been proven to reduce bugs to almost nil - where
current products like bleach or other disinfectants are seen as less
reliably effective. The product is natural and even safe to drink, the
firm claims.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The development by Aqualution comes
after Scotland's "dirty dozen" hospitals were named and shamed by the
Healthcare Environment Inspectorate last week. They included
Edinburgh's Western General, Aberdeen Royal Infirmary and Queen
Margaret Hospital in Dunfermline.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The process for creating hypochlorous
acid, a solution that naturally occurs in the human body and a
by-product of mixing chlorine and water, has been known since the
1970s. It was first developed as part of the Russian space programme.
But until recently, the solution has proved unstable and couldn't be
stored. Aqualution believes it has developed a process whereby the
resulting product is stable and can be sold in spray bottles and barrels</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Steve Godber, the chairman of
Aqualution, said: "The product is usually generated in situ for use in
industrial cleaning, for food and drink plants. We have managed to get
it with a shelf-life of about two years. That transforms it to
something that you can use packaged where and when you need it."</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Aqualution has a turnover of less than
&pound;1 million, generated through the manufacture of electrodialysis
machines at Duns, which the firm sells or leases to customers,
particularly in the food and agriculture sector. Clients include drinks
maker Britvic and Glenrath Farms, one of Scotland's largest egg
producers.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Godber aims to scale up the business
through both the leasing of machines and the sale of bottles of biocide
water. The firm will invest &pound;25,000 expand its operation in Duns
to start packaging the product in half-litre and one-litre bottles,
plus five-litre drums.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Aqualution has also applied to have
the solution registered under the European Biocidal Products Directive.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Godber estimates it will take another
year-and-a-half to complete the registration process, but says this
will give the firm's product a competitive edge.he total cost of the
application will reach &pound;1m.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">

aspirin dose 'for everyone over 45'<br>
</big><br>
By <br>

</div>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Everyone aged over 45 should consider
a small daily dose of aspirin to
help protect themselves against heart disease and cancer, a panel of
experts suggested yesterday.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Evidence is building that the benefits
for many healthy middle-aged and
older people &#8220;far outweigh&#8221; the side effects, according to the
academics.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">In particular, individuals at higher
risk from the country&#8217;s two
biggest killers would be helped by taking the painkiller as a
preventive medicine, they added.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The experts were speaking at the Royal
Society of Medicine a month
after research from Oxford University published in The Lancet showed
that taking 75mg of aspirin daily for five years reduces the risk of
getting bowel cancer by a quarter, and deaths from the disease by a
third. A 75mg dose is a quarter of the standard over-the-counter pill.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Earlier studies had already shown that
a low daily dose could reduce
the risk of developing heart disease.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Members of the panel said that the
recent research was potentially of
&#8220;enormous importance&#8221; to public health.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Bowel, or colorectal, cancer is the
third most common form of the
disease in Britain, with 39,000 diagnoses annually and 16,000 deaths.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The Lancet study suggests greater
aspirin use could potentially save
thousands of lives a year in relation to this one cancer alone.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">But research is also looking into
whether aspirin could have a
preventive effect on other types of cancer as well.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Combined, all cancers claim more than
150,000 lives in Britain every
year, while cardiovascular disease accounts for some 200,000 deaths.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Prof Peter Rothwell, the Oxford
neurologist who led the bowel cancer
study and was part of yesterday&#8217;s panel, has started taking a daily
dose of aspirin himself. He said: &#8220;I suspect that in five to 10 years&#8217;
time we will be prescribing aspirin to middle-aged people, not only for
the known vascular benefits.&#8221;</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">But members of the public might take
matters into their own hands
before then, he predicted.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">&#8220;If it becomes clear that there are
benefits for other cancers, then
the balance of risk and benefit will become so clear that people may
take the decision to take it for themselves,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It seems
implausible that this effect on colorectal cancer is going to be a
completely isolated phenomenon in relation to other cancers, given that
we know that there are similarities between how cancers develop.&#8221;</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Prof Rothwell said that he thought it
would be &#8220;sensible&#8221; for people to
start taking aspirin at about 45, when the chance of developing bowel
and other cancers began to rise. &#8220;The risk of cancer goes up
substantially between the age of 40 and 55,&#8221; he said.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">As aspirin had a preventive effect, it
was advisable to start taking it
daily towards the beginning of that period, he explained. However, he
said it was ultimately up to individuals to decide whether to take the
drug, &#8220;rather than us making definitive statements&#8221;.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Prof Peter Elwood, of Cardiff
University&#8217;s School of Medicine, who
conducted the first trial into the effect of aspirin on heart disease
in the 1970s, said: &#8220;I think we are on the brink of another
breakthrough of enormous importance to the community in general.&#8221;</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Prof Gordon McVie, a leading cancer
specialist, from the European
Institute of Oncology, said the discussion among the experts was
whether this was metaphorically a &#8220;put-it-in-the-water moment&#8221;.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Opinion on the subject varies however.
Experts are divided particularly
over the question of to whom aspirin should be recommended as a daily
preventive medicine.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The drug was formulated as a
painkiller more than a century ago but
researchers are finding that it can help in diseases ranging from heart
disease to dementia.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Advocates believe that its active
ingredient is akin to a vitamin that
almost everybody should take, as our modern diet does not provide it.
Others point out that taking the drug is known to double the incidence
of intestinal bleeding, from about one in 1,000 people per year to
about two.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The question is how much of the
population &#8211; in terms of their age and
their risk of developing serious diseases &#8211; should be recommended to
take aspirin on a daily basis.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Prof McVie said: &#8220;I think there&#8217;s a
frankly conservative feeling in
this group, that for [colorectal] cancer, it should be targeted for
people at higher risk.&#8221;</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Prof Sir John Burn, a geneticist at
Newcastle University, said: &#8220;The
problem is, if we recommend something to the whole population, then we
will see side effects.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">&#8220;We know aspirin can cause
gastrointestinal bleeding. That is to some
extent holding back the situation.&#8221; Prof Dion Morton, a colorectal
surgeon at University Hospital Birmingham, was another of those
attending yesterday&#8217;s meeting, which was convened by the Aspirin
Foundation.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">He said that medicine was increasingly
using a &#8220;stratified approach,
where we target the right drugs at the right patients&#8221;.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">He thought regulatory approval should
be sought for doctors to
prescribe aspirin as a preventive medicine for those at a higher risk
of bowel cancer. &#8220;If they have not been told in writing they should be
advocating it, they won&#8217;t advocate it,&#8221; Prof Morton said.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">While intestinal bleeding was serious,
research suggested that aspirin
increased the risk only of less serious cases, said Prof Elwood. He
said there was some evidence that the intestines adjusted to aspirin
over the long term.</span><br>

Deaths, Study Finds -- But Caution UrgeD</span><span

dose of aspirin significantly reduces the number of deaths from a whole

 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">A daily low dose of aspirin
significantly reduces the number of deaths from a whole range of common
cancers, an Oxford University study has found.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The 20% drop in all cancer deaths seen
in the study adds new evidence to the debate about whether otherwise
healthy people in their 40s and 50s should consider taking a low dose
of aspirin each day.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Aspirin is already known to be
beneficial for those at high risk of heart disease. But among healthy
people, the benefit in lower chances of heart problems only marginally
outweighs the small risk of stomach bleeds.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The large size of the effect now seen
in preventing cancer deaths may begin to tip the balance in favour of
taking aspirin, the scientists suggest, but say that it is a matter for
the health bodies who write treatment guidelines.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">"These results do not mean that all
adults should immediately start taking aspirin," cautions Professor
Peter Rothwell of the Department of Clinical Neurology at Oxford
University, who led the work. "But they do demonstrate major new
benefits that have not previously been factored into guideline
recommendations."</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">"Previous guidelines have rightly
cautioned that in healthy middle aged people the small risk of bleeding
on aspirin partly offsets the benefit from prevention of strokes and
heart attacks, but the reductions in deaths due to several common
cancers will now alter this balance for many people."</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">However, he adds: "I don't think it's
necessarily right for the person who did the research to say what
guidelines should be. We can't say with absolute certainty that there
won't be some unknown harm in taking aspirin for 30 years, but it looks
as if there would be pretty large benefits in reducing cancer deaths.
People have to accept there's some uncertainty here."</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Professor Rothwell and colleagues
recently established that a low dose of aspirin (75 mg per day, or a
quarter of the normal dose taken for pain relief) taken for longer than
five years reduces death rates from bowel cancer by more than a third.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">In this new work, scientists from
Oxford, Edinburgh, London and Japan used data on over 670 deaths from
cancer in a range of randomised trials involving over 25,000 people.
These trials compared daily use of aspirin against no aspirin and were
done originally to look for any preventative effect against heart
disease.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The results, published in the Lancet,
showed that aspirin reduced death due to any cancer by around 20%
during the trials. But the benefits of aspirin only became apparent
after taking the drug for 5 years or more, suggesting aspirin works by
slowing or preventing the early stages of the disease so that the
effect is only seen much later.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">After 5 years of taking aspirin, the
data from patients in the trials showed that death rates were 34% less
for all cancers and as much as 54% less for gastrointestinal cancers,
such as oesophagus, stomach, bowel, pancreas and liver cancers.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The researchers also wanted to
determine if the benefits from aspirin continued over time. By using
cancer registries and death records, they were able to follow up what
had happened to participants in three of the trials.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">They showed that risk of cancer death
over a period of 20 years remained 20% lower for all solid cancers
among those who had taken aspirin (even though they would have been
unlikely to have continued taking aspirin after the trials finished),
and 35% lower for gastrointestinal cancers.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">It took about 5 years to see a benefit
in taking aspirin for oesophagus, pancreatic, brain, and lung cancer;
about 10 years for stomach and bowel cancer; and about 15 years for
prostate cancer. The 20-year risk of death was reduced by about 10% for
prostate cancer, 30% for lung cancer, 40% for bowel cancer and 60% for
oesophagus cancer.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">As the evidence points to a delayed
preventative effect against cancer, Professor Rothwell believes that it
would be those who started taking aspirin in their late 40s or 50s --
ie before people's risk of cancer starts increasing -- and then
continued for 20 to 30 years who might eventually see the most benefit.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Professor Rothwell estimates that in
terms of cost-effectiveness, taking low-dose aspirin daily is likely to
be much more cost-effective than those interventions already used for
preventing cancer, such as screening for breast or prostate cancer.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">He does note that more research is
necessary to understand more about the effect aspirin has on cancer.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">While this study looked at how aspirin
affected deaths from cancer, Professor Rothwell and colleagues now aim
to look at any protective effect of aspirin on the incidence or
progression of cancer. The researchers also point out that more trial
data are needed on breast cancer and other cancers that particularly
affect women.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">"Perhaps the most important finding
for the longer term is the proof of principle that cancers can be
prevented by simple compounds like aspirin," says Professor Rothwell.</span><br>

Off Bowel Cancer, Study Finds</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
</big></div>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Even the lowest possible dose of
aspirin (75 mg) can ward off bowel cancer, if taken regularly, finds
research published online in the journal Gut.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">This protective effect is apparent
after just one year and in the general population, not just those
considered to be at risk of developing the disease, which is the second
most common cause of cancer death in the world, killing almost half a
million people every year.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Although previous research has shown
that aspirin protects against bowel cancer, it is not known what the
most effective dose is and how long it needs to be taken for.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The research team investigated just
under 2,800 people with bowel cancer and just under 3,000 healthy
people, matched for age, sex, and residential locality.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">All participants completed food
frequency and lifestyle questionnaires to assess their usual diet and
lifestyle choices, which are known to influence bowel cancer risk.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">NSAID (non-steroidal anti inflammatory
drug) intake was categorised as taking more than four tablets a month
of low dose aspirin (75 mg), other NSAIDs, or a mix.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The likelihood of surviving bowel
cancer once diagnosed or developing the disease anew was then tracked
over five years.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">In all, 354 (15.5%) of those with
bowel cancer were taking low dose aspirin compared with 526 (18%) of
their healthy peers.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Taking any NSAID regularly, curbed the
chances of developing bowel cancer compared with those who didn't take
these painkillers.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">This finding held true, irrespective
of lifestyle choices, age, diet, weight, and level of deprivation</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">After a year, taking daily low dose
aspirin was associated with a 22% reduced risk of developing bowel
cancer, and the magnitude of the reduction in risk was cumulative,
rising to 30% after five years.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Some 1,170 people died out of a total
of 3,417 people diagnosed with bowel cancer (including those who were
healthy at the start of the study) during the monitoring period. Most
of these deaths (1,023) were attributable to the disease.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Information on NSAID intake was
available for 676 of these 1,023 deaths, and it showed that taking
NSAIDs of any kind did not influence the risk of death from any cause
nor did it increase bowel cancer survival.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">But, crucially, the findings show that
high doses of aspirin, taken for a long time, are not needed to help
ward off bowel cancer, say the authors.</span><br>

Reduced Risk Of Dying In Women</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
</big></div>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Women who take low to moderate doses
of aspirin have a reduced risk of death from any cause, and especially
heart disease--related deaths, according to a report in the March 26
issue of Archives of Internal Medicine, one of the JAMA/Archives
journals.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Some studies have provided evidence
that aspirin may reduce the risk of heart disease and some types of
cancer, the two leading causes of death in U.S. women, according to
background information in the article. However, it is unclear whether
aspirin reduces the risk of death overall for women.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Andrew T. Chan, M.D., M.P.H.,
Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, and
colleagues examined the association between aspirin use and death in
79,439 women enrolled in the Nurses' Health Study, a large group of
female nurses who have been followed since 1976. Beginning in 1980 and
again every two years through 2004, the women were asked if they used
aspirin regularly and if so, how many tablets they typically took per
week. At the beginning of the study, the women had no history of
cardiovascular disease or cancer.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">A total of 45,305 women did not use
aspirin; 29,132 took low to moderate doses (one to 14 standard
325-milligram tablets of aspirin per week); and 5,002 took more than 14
tablets per week. By June 1, 2004, 9,477 of the women had died, 1,991
of heart disease and 4,469 of cancer. Women who reported using aspirin
currently had a 25 percent lower risk of death from any cause than
women who never used aspirin regularly. The association was stronger
for death from cardiovascular disease (women who used aspirin had a 38
percent lower risk) than for death from cancer (women who used aspirin
had a 12 percent lower risk).</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">"Use of aspirin for one to five years
was associated with significant reductions in cardiovascular
mortality," the authors write. "In contrast, a significant reduction in
risk of cancer deaths was not observed until after 10 years of aspirin
use. The benefit associated with aspirin was confined to low and
moderate doses and was significantly greater in older participants and
those with more cardiac risk factors."</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">There are several mechanisms by which
aspirin could reduce the risk of death, the authors note. "Aspirin
therapy may influence cardiovascular disease and cancer through its
effect on common pathogenic pathways such as inflammation, insulin
resistance, oxidative stress [damage to the cells caused by oxygen
exposure] and cyclooxygenase (COX) enzyme activity," also linked to
inflammation, they write.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Because the study looked at women who
made the decision themselves whether or not to take aspirin, as opposed
to a clinical trial where women are randomly assigned to aspirin or a
placebo, the results do not suggest that all women should take aspirin.
"Nevertheless, these data support a need for continued investigation of
the use of aspirin for chronic disease prevention," the authors
conclude.</span><br>

 style="font-weight: bold;">Low-Dose Aspirin Reduces Cardiovascular
Events, Analysis Shows</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
</big></div>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Taking low-dose aspirin daily reduces
the risk of heart attack and stroke, as well as the risk of dying,
among patients who previously have had a heart attack or stroke but
whose cardiovascular disease has stabilized, according to a new
analysis by Duke University Medical Center cardiologists.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The study also found that taking
low-dose aspirin daily increases a patient's risk of bleeding, but the
researchers said the protective benefits of aspirin outweigh this side
effect. A daily dose of aspirin is considered low if it is between 81
milligrams and 325 milligrams.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">"Among patients with stable
cardiovascular disease, we found that low-dose aspirin reduced
incidence of heart attack, stroke and death," said cardiology fellow
Jeffrey Berger, M.D., who presented the results of the study on
Wednesday, Nov. 15, at the annual scientific sessions of the American
Heart Association, in Chicago.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">"We also saw an increased risk of
bleeding among patients taking aspirin, but as in the decision-making
process involving any therapy, there is always the weighing of benefits
and risks," Berger added. "Since a great majority of patients can
tolerate aspirin, the benefits appear to outweigh the risks. Aspirin is
a drug that has been used for many years. It is well-understood,
effective, inexpensive and widely available. In aspirin we have a
proven life-saver."</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The study was supported by Duke's
Division of Cardiology.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Aspirin exerts its protective effect
by preventing the clumping together of platelets circulating in the
blood, according to the researchers. It is this anticlotting action
that also causes unwanted bleeding.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">In the Duke study, Berger and
colleagues combined the data from six clinical trials that enrolled
patients with stable cardiovascular disease or stable angina, or chest
pain, and gave them low-dose aspirin. In total, the trials included
9,853 patients.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The researchers found that patients
who took low-dose aspirin had a 26 percent reduction in the risk of a
nonfatal heart attack, a 25 percent reduction in the risk of stroke and
a 13 percent reduction in risk of death, compared with similar heart
patients who did not take aspirin. Taken together, Berger said,
patients on low-dose aspirin had a 21 percent reduction in risk of
experiencing a major cardiovascular event, a measurement that is the
combination of the rates of nonfatal heart attack and stroke and of
cardiovascular death.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">In terms of aspirin's effect in
promoting bleeding, the study found that one patient out of 111 who
received low-dose aspirin experienced a bleeding episode, Berger said.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Putting the results another way,
Berger said, the results suggest that treating 83 patients will prevent
one nonfatal heart attack, treating 40 patients will prevent one
stroke, treating 30 patients will prevent one major cardiovascular
event and treating 71 patients will prevent one death.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">"When compared to other medications
that have been proven effective in preventing cardiovascular events,
aspirin comes off looking very good," Berger said.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">For example, 91 patients would need to
be treated with ACE inhibitors to prevent one death, compared with 71
patients for aspirin, he said. ACE inhibitors dilate blood vessels,
making it easier for the heart to pump blood. Ninety-one patients would
need to be treated with the inhibitors to prevent one heart attack,
compared with 83 for aspirin, and 167 would need to be treated with the
inhibitors to prevent one stroke, compared with 40 patients with
aspirin.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">"These comparisons show that a cheap
and inexpensive medicine like aspirin is just as good, if not better,
than other expensive medicines," Berger said.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Still, there is room for improvement
in aspirin therapy, he said. In particular, he said, more study is
needed to identify what dosage in the low-dose range -- from 81
milligrams to 325 milligrams a day -- will provide the best
benefit-to-risk profile.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Other members of the research team
were Richard Becker of Duke and David Brown of the State University of
New York-Stony Brook Medical Center.</span><br>

Asthma Risk In Women, Study Finds</span></span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(0, 51, 0);">
</big></div>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">A small dose of aspirin on alternate
days can cut the risk of developing asthma among women, suggests a
large study, published ahead of print in Thorax.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The findings are based on almost
40,000 female healthcare professionals, who were part of the Women's
Health Study. The women were all aged 45 and above, and had no serious
illness, allergy, or asthma at the start of the study.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Participants were either randomly
assigned to take 100 mg of aspirin every other day, or a dummy tablet
(placebo). And their health was then monitored for around 10 years.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">During this time, there were 10% fewer
new cases of asthma diagnosed among the women taking aspirin.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">In this group 872 new cases were
diagnosed compared with 963 among those taking the placebo.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The effect was evident, irrespective
of age, menopausal status, exercise levels, and smoking, all factors
that might be expected to influence the findings.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">And vitamin E supplementation, which
was also being tested among the women, to see if it prevented
cardiovascular disease and cancer, did not affect the results either.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">But aspirin did not lessen the risk of
asthma in women who were classified as obese.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Previous research in male doctors
showed that aspirin cut the risks of asthma by 22%, although the dose
was much higher, at 325 mg every other day.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Among people who have already been
diagnosed with asthma, aspirin can worsen symptoms in around one in 10,
say the authors. But exactly how low dose aspirin might reduce
susceptibility to asthma in adults is not clear.</span><br

and the blood turns to the bones to replenish its calcium.</span><br

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Cancer? Carbonated beverages cause
acid reflux, damaging tissues in vulnerable areas, such as the

100,000 times more acidic than water.</span><br

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Salt in carbonated beverages reduces

<span style="font-weight: bold;">The problem of beer&nbsp; That it is
within a 'bottle', i.e. a boundaryless compact 2-manifold homeomorphic
to the sphere.&nbsp; Since beer bottles are not (usually) pathological
or "wild" spheres, but smooth manifolds, they separate 3-space into two
non-communicating regions: inside, containing beer, and outside,
containing you.&nbsp; This state must not remain.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">A proposed solution&nbsp; Clearly the
elegant course is to introduce a non-orientable manifold, which has one
side and does not divide 3-space.&nbsp; When juxtaposed with the
beer-bounding manifold described above, it acts to disrupt the
continuity thereof, canceling the outdated paradigm of distinction
between interior and exterior.&nbsp; This enables the desired

</div>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">A pill that may increase resistance to
cold is being tested at the Arctic Aeromedical Laboratory near
Fairbanks, Alaska. The pill contains glycine, an amino-acid that causes
the body to generate more heat than it can otherwise produce. It is
hoped the pill might enable men to stay alive longer in icy water, and
hasten the warming of a man who has been chilled to a critical point of
exposure. At the laboratory, operated by the Air Force at Ladd Air
Force Base, volunteers are taking the pills with no evidence of ill
effect. If the tests are successful the pills could be included in
survival kits. Glycine also may make possible a technique of heart
surgery in which the heart can be chilled to the point where it stops
for an hour or more without suffering damage. According to scientists
working at the Air Force laboratory, the heart suffers &#8220;ventricular
fibrillation&#8221; when its temperature is lowered to about 78 degrees
Fahrenheit. This is a loss of rhythmic beat, which causes death. Hence,
in heart surgery, the organ can be chilled only enough to stop its
beating for six or eight minutes. Glycine in the bloodstream may enable
the heart to be chilled past this critical temperature. Extensive
research has been carried out at the laboratory with Negroes, Eskimos,
and whites to find out why some ethnic groups seem more resistant to
cold than others. Among Negroes who agreed to act as subjects in the
experiments, basal metabolism&#8212;that is, their rate of energy
production&#8212;fell more rapidly than it did in white men. Similar studies
of Eskimos produced no evidence that their bodies were better equipped
for the cold than those of white men. The Eskimos&#8217; ability to endure
extremely low temperatures seems based on acquired skills and
excellently adapted clothing and diet.</span><br>

<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Human beings (like all other animals)
draw their energy from the food
they eat. Until the last century, all of the food energy available on
this planet was derived from the sun through photosynthesis. Either you
ate plants or you ate animals that fed on plants, but the energy in
your food was ultimately derived from the sun.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">It would have been absurd to think
that we would one day run out of
sunshine. No, sunshine was an abundant, renewable resource, and the
process of photosynthesis fed all life on this planet. It also set a
limit on the amount of food that could be generated at any one time,
and therefore placed a limit upon population growth. Solar energy has a
limited rate of flow into this planet. To increase your food
production, you had to increase the acreage under cultivation, and
displace your competitors. There was no other way to increase the
amount of energy available for food production. Human population grew
by displacing everything else and appropriating more and more of the
available solar energy.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The need to expand agricultural
production was one of the motive causes
behind most of the wars in recorded history, along with expansion of
the energy base (and agricultural production is truly an essential
portion of the energy base). And when Europeans could no longer expand
cultivation, they began the task of conquering the world. Explorers
were followed by conquistadors and traders and settlers. The declared
reasons for expansion may have been trade, avarice, empire or simply
curiosity, but at its base, it was all about the expansion of
agricultural productivity. Wherever explorers and conquistadors
traveled, they may have carried off loot, but they left plantations.
And settlers toiled to clear land and establish their own homestead.
This conquest and expansion went on until there was no place left for
further expansion. Certainly, to this day, landowners and farmers fight
to claim still more land for agricultural productivity, but they are
fighting over crumbs. Today, virtually all of the productive land on
this planet is being exploited by agriculture. What remains unused is
too steep, too wet, too dry or lacking in soil nutrients.1</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Just when agricultural output could
expand no more by increasing
acreage, new innovations made possible a more thorough exploitation of
the acreage already available. The process of &#8220;pest&#8221; displacement and
appropriation for agriculture accelerated with the industrial
revolution as the mechanization of agriculture hastened the clearing
and tilling of land and augmented the amount of farmland which could be
tended by one person. With every increase in food production, the human
population grew apace.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">At present, nearly 40% of all
land-based photosynthetic capability has
been appropriated by human beings.2 In the United States we divert more
than half of the energy captured by photosynthesis.3 We have taken over
all the prime real estate on this planet. The rest of nature is forced
to make due with what is left. Plainly, this is one of the major
factors in species extinctions and in ecosystem stress.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">The Green
Revolution</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">In the 1950s and 1960s, agriculture
underwent a drastic transformation
commonly referred to as the Green Revolution. The Green Revolution
resulted in the industrialization of agriculture. Part of the advance
resulted from new hybrid food plants, leading to more productive food
crops. Between 1950 and 1984, as the Green Revolution transformed
agriculture around the globe, world grain production increased by
250%.4 That is a tremendous increase in the amount of food energy
available for human consumption. This additional energy did not come
from an increase in incipient sunlight, nor did it result from
introducing agriculture to new vistas of land. The energy for the Green
Revolution was provided by fossil fuels in the form of fertilizers
(natural gas), pesticides (oil), and hydrocarbon fueled irrigation.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The Green Revolution increased the
energy flow to agriculture by an
average of 50 times the energy input of traditional agriculture.5 In
the most extreme cases, energy consumption by agriculture has increased
100 fold or more.6</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">In the United States, 400 gallons of
oil equivalents are expended
annually to feed each American (as of data provided in 1994).7
Agricultural energy consumption is broken down as follows:</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">31% for the manufacture of inorganic
fertilizer</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">19% for the operation of field
machinery</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">16% for transportation</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">13% for irrigation</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">08% for raising livestock (not
including livestock feed)</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">05% for crop drying</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">05% for pesticide production</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">08% miscellaneous8</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Energy costs for packaging,
refrigeration, transportation to retail
outlets, and household cooking are not considered in these figures.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">To give the reader an idea of the
energy intensiveness of modern
agriculture, production of one kilogram of nitrogen for fertilizer
requires the energy equivalent of from 1.4 to 1.8 liters of diesel
fuel. This is not considering the natural gas feedstock.9 According to
The Fertilizer Institute (http://www.tfi.org), in the year from June 30
2001 until June 30 2002 the United States used 12,009,300 short tons of
nitrogen fertilizer.10 Using the low figure of 1.4 liters diesel
equivalent per kilogram of nitrogen, this equates to the energy content
of 15.3 billion liters of diesel fuel, or 96.2 million barrels.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;Of course, this is only a rough
comparison to aid comprehension
of the energy requirements for modern agriculture.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">In a very real sense, we are literally
eating fossil fuels. However,
due to the laws of thermodynamics, there is not a direct correspondence
between energy inflow and outflow in agriculture. Along the way, there
is a marked energy loss. Between 1945 and 1994, energy input to
agriculture increased 4-fold while crop yields only increased 3-fold.11
Since then, energy input has continued to increase without a
corresponding increase in crop yield. We have reached the point of
marginal returns. Yet, due to soil degradation, increased demands of
pest management and increasing energy costs for irrigation (all of
which is examined below), modern agriculture must continue increasing
its energy expenditures simply to maintain current crop yields. The
Green Revolution is becoming bankrupt.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">Fossil Fuel
Costs</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Solar energy is a renewable resource
limited only by the inflow rate
from the sun to the earth. Fossil fuels, on the other hand, are a
stock-type resource that can be exploited at a nearly limitless rate.
However, on a human timescale, fossil fuels are nonrenewable. They
represent a planetary energy deposit which we can draw from at any rate
we wish, but which will eventually be exhausted without renewal. The
Green Revolution tapped into this energy deposit and used it to
increase agricultural production.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Total fossil fuel use in the United
States has increased 20-fold in the
last 4 decades. In the US, we consume 20 to 30 times more fossil fuel
energy per capita than people in developing nations. Agriculture
directly accounts for 17% of all the energy used in this country.12 As
of 1990, we were using approximately 1,000 liters (6.41 barrels) of oil
to produce food of one hectare of land.13</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">In 1994, David Pimentel and Mario
Giampietro estimated the output/input
ratio of agriculture to be around 1.4.14 For 0.7 Kilogram-Calories
(kcal) of fossil energy consumed, U.S. agriculture produced 1 kcal of
food. The input figure for this ratio was based on FAO (Food and
Agriculture Organization of the UN) statistics, which consider only
fertilizers (without including fertilizer feedstock), irrigation,
pesticides (without including pesticide feedstock), and machinery and
fuel for field operations. Other agricultural energy inputs not
considered were energy and machinery for drying crops, transportation
for inputs and outputs to and from the farm, electricity, and
construction and maintenance of farm buildings and infrastructures.
Adding in estimates for these energy costs brought the input/output
energy ratio down to 1.15 Yet this does not include the energy expense
of packaging, delivery to retail outlets, refrigeration or household
cooking.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">In a subsequent study completed later
that same year (1994), Giampietro
and Pimentel managed to derive a more accurate ratio of the net fossil
fuel energy ratio of agriculture.16 In this study, the authors defined
two separate forms of energy input: Endosomatic energy and Exosomatic
energy. Endosomatic energy is generated through the metabolic
transformation of food energy into muscle energy in the human body.
Exosomatic energy is generated by transforming energy outside of the
human body, such as burning gasoline in a tractor. This assessment
allowed the authors to look at fossil fuel input alone and in ratio to
other inputs.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Prior to the industrial revolution,
virtually 100% of both endosomatic
and exosomatic energy was solar driven. Fossil fuels now represent 90%
of the exosomatic energy used in the United States and other developed
countries.17 The typical exo/endo ratio of pre-industrial, solar
powered societies is about 4 to 1. The ratio has changed tenfold in
developed countries, climbing to 40 to 1. And in the United States it
is more than 90 to 1.18 The nature of the way we use endosomatic energy
has changed as well.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The vast majority of endosomatic
energy is no longer expended to
deliver power for direct economic processes. Now the majority of
endosomatic energy is utilized to generate the flow of information
directing the flow of exosomatic energy driving machines. Considering
the 90/1 exo/endo ratio in the United States, each endosomatic kcal of
energy expended in the US induces the circulation of 90 kcal of
exosomatic energy. As an example, a small gasoline engine can convert
the 38,000 kcal in one gallon of gasoline into 8.8 KWh (Kilowatt
hours), which equates to about 3 weeks of work for one human being.19</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">In their refined study, Giampietro and
Pimentel found that 10 kcal of
exosomatic energy are required to produce 1 kcal of food delivered to
the consumer in the U.S. food system. This includes packaging and all
delivery expenses, but excludes household cooking).20 The U.S. food
system consumes ten times more energy than it produces in food energy.
This disparity is made possible by nonrenewable fossil fuel stocks.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Assuming a figure of 2,500 kcal per
capita for the daily diet in the
United States, the 10/1 ratio translates into a cost of 35,000 kcal of
exosomatic energy per capita each day. However, considering that the
average return on one hour of endosomatic labor in the U.S. is about
100,000 kcal of exosomatic energy, the flow of exosomatic energy
required to supply the daily diet is achieved in only 20 minutes of
labor in our current system. Unfortunately, if you remove fossil fuels
from the equation, the daily diet will require 111 hours of endosomatic
labor per capita; that is, the current U.S. daily diet would require
nearly three weeks of labor per capita to produce.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Quite plainly, as fossil fuel
production begins to decline within the
next decade, there will be less energy available for the production of
food.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">Soil, Cropland
and Water</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Modern intensive agriculture is
unsustainable. Technologically-enhanced
agriculture has augmented soil erosion, polluted and overdrawn
groundwater and surface water, and even (largely due to increased
pesticide use) caused serious public health and environmental problems.
Soil erosion, overtaxed cropland and water resource overdraft in turn
lead to even greater use of fossil fuels and hydrocarbon products. More
hydrocarbon-based fertilizers must be applied, along with more
pesticides; irrigation water requires more energy to pump; and fossil
fuels are used to process polluted water.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">It takes 500 years to replace 1 inch
of topsoil.21 In a natural
environment, topsoil is built up by decaying plant matter and
weathering rock, and it is protected from erosion by growing plants. In
soil made susceptible by agriculture, erosion is reducing productivity
up to 65% each year.22 Former prairie lands, which constitute the bread
basket of the United States, have lost one half of their topsoil after
farming for about 100 years. This soil is eroding 30 times faster than
the natural formation rate.23 Food crops are much hungrier than the
natural grasses that once covered the Great Plains. As a result, the
remaining topsoil is increasingly depleted of nutrients. Soil erosion
and mineral depletion removes about $20 billion worth of plant
nutrients from U.S. agricultural soils every year.24 Much of the soil
in the Great Plains is little more than a sponge into which we must
pour hydrocarbon-based fertilizers in order to produce crops.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Every year in the U.S., more than 2
million acres of cropland are lost
to erosion, salinization and water logging. On top of this,
urbanization, road building, and industry claim another 1 million acres
annually from farmland.24 Approximately three-quarters of the land area
in the United States is devoted to agriculture and commercial
forestry.25 The expanding human population is putting increasing
pressure on land availability. Incidentally, only a small portion of
U.S. land area remains available for the solar energy technologies
necessary to support a solar energy-based economy. The land area for
harvesting biomass is likewise limited. For this reason, the
development of solar energy or biomass must be at the expense of
agriculture.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Modern agriculture also places a
strain on our water resources.
Agriculture consumes fully 85% of all U.S. freshwater resources.26
Overdraft is occurring from many surface water resources, especially in
the west and south. The typical example is the Colorado River, which is
diverted to a trickle by the time it reaches the Pacific. Yet surface
water only supplies 60% of the water used in irrigation. The remainder,
and in some places the majority of water for irrigation, comes from
ground water aquifers. Ground water is recharged slowly by the
percolation of rainwater through the earth's crust. Less than 0.1% of
the stored ground water mined annually is replaced by rainfall.27 The
great Ogallala aquifer that supplies agriculture, industry and home use
in much of the southern and central plains states has an annual
overdraft up to 160% above its recharge rate. The Ogallala aquifer will
become unproductive in a matter of decades.28</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">We can illustrate the demand that
modern agriculture places on water
resources by looking at a farmland producing corn. A corn crop that
produces 118 bushels/acre/year requires more than 500,000 gallons/acre
of water during the growing season. The production of 1 pound of maize
requires 1,400 pounds (or 175 gallons) of water.29 Unless something is
done to lower these consumption rates, modern agriculture will help to
propel the United States into a water crisis.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">In the last two decades, the use of
hydrocarbon-based pesticides in the
U.S. has increased 33-fold, yet each year we lose more crops to
pests.30 This is the result of the abandonment of traditional crop
rotation practices. Nearly 50% of U.S. corn land is grown continuously
as a monoculture.31 This results in an increase in corn pests, which in
turn requires the use of more pesticides. Pesticide use on corn crops
had increased 1,000-fold even before the introduction of genetically
engineered, pesticide resistant corn. However, corn losses have still
risen 4-fold.32</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Modern intensive agriculture is
unsustainable. It is damaging the land,
draining water supplies and polluting the environment. And all of this
requires more and more fossil fuel input to pump irrigation water, to
replace nutrients, to provide pest protection, to remediate the
environment and simply to hold crop production at a constant. Yet this
necessary fossil fuel input is going to crash headlong into declining
fossil fuel production.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">US Consumption</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">In the United States, each person
consumes an average of 2,175 pounds
of food per person per year. This provides the U.S. consumer with an
average daily energy intake of 3,600 Calories. The world average is
2,700 Calories per day.33 Fully 19% of the U.S. caloric intake comes
from fast food. Fast food accounts for 34% of the total food
consumption for the average U.S. citizen. The average citizen dines out
for one meal out of four.34</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">One third of the caloric intake of the
average American comes from
animal sources (including dairy products), totaling 800 pounds per
person per year. This diet means that U.S. citizens derive 40% of their
calories from fat-nearly half of their diet. 35</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Americans are also grand consumers of
water. As of one decade ago,
Americans were consuming 1,450 gallons/day/capita (g/d/c), with the
largest amount expended on agriculture. Allowing for projected
population increase, consumption by 2050 is projected at 700 g/d/c,
which hydrologists consider to be minimal for human needs.36 This is
without taking into consideration declining fossil fuel production.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">To provide all of this food requires
the application of 0.6 million
metric tons of pesticides in North America per year. This is over one
fifth of the total annual world pesticide use, estimated at 2.5 million
tons.37 Worldwide, more nitrogen fertilizer is used per year than can
be supplied through natural sources. Likewise, water is pumped out of
underground aquifers at a much higher rate than it is recharged. And
stocks of important minerals, such as phosphorus and potassium, are
quickly approaching exhaustion.38</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Total U.S. energy consumption is more
than three times the amount of
solar energy harvested as crop and forest products. The United States
consumes 40% more energy annually than the total amount of solar energy
captured yearly by all U.S. plant biomass. Per capita use of fossil
energy in North America is five times the world average.39</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Our prosperity is built on the
principal of exhausting the world's
resources as quickly as possible, without any thought to our neighbors,
all the other life on this planet, or our children.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">Population
&amp; Sustainability</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Considering a growth rate of 1.1% per
year, the U.S. population is
projected to double by 2050. As the population expands, an estimated
one acre of land will be lost for every person added to the U.S.
population. Currently, there are 1.8 acres of farmland available to
grow food for each U.S. citizen. By 2050, this will decrease to 0.6
acres. 1.2 acres per person is required in order to maintain current
dietary standards.40</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Presently, only two nations on the
planet are major exporters of grain:
the United States and Canada.41 By 2025, it is expected that the U.S.
will cease to be a food exporter due to domestic demand. The impact on
the U.S. economy could be devastating, as food exports earn $40 billion
for the U.S. annually. More importantly, millions of people around the
world could starve to death without U.S. food exports.42</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Domestically, 34.6 million people are
living in poverty as of 2002
census data.43 And this number is continuing to grow at an alarming
rate. Too many of these people do not have a sufficient diet. As the
situation worsens, this number will increase and the United States will
witness growing numbers of starvation fatalities.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">There are some things that we can do
to at least alleviate this
tragedy. It is suggested that streamlining agriculture to get rid of
losses, waste and mismanagement might cut the energy inputs for food
production by up to one-half.35 In place of fossil fuel-based
fertilizers, we could utilize livestock manures that are now wasted. It
is estimated that livestock manures contain 5 times the amount of
fertilizer currently used each year.36 Perhaps most effective would be
to eliminate meat from our diet altogether.37</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Mario Giampietro and David Pimentel
postulate that a sustainable food
system is possible only if four conditions are met:</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">1.&nbsp;&nbsp; Environmentally sound
agricultural technologies must be
implemented.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">2.&nbsp;&nbsp; Renewable energy
technologies must be put into place.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">3.&nbsp;&nbsp; Major increases in
energy efficiency must reduce
exosomatic energy consumption per capita.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">4.&nbsp;&nbsp; Population size and
consumption must be compatible with
maintaining the stability of environmental processes.38</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Providing that the first three
conditions are met, with a reduction to
less than half of the exosomatic energy consumption per capita, the
authors place the maximum population for a sustainable economy at 200
million.39 Several other studies have produced figures within this
ballpark (Energy and Population, Werbos, Paul J.
http://www.dieoff.com/page63.htm; Impact of Population Growth on Food
Supplies and Environment, Pimentel, David, et al.
http://www.dieoff.com/page57.htm).</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Given that the current U.S. population
is in excess of 292 million, 40
that would mean a reduction of 92 million. To achieve a sustainable
economy and avert disaster, the United States must reduce its
population by at least one-third. The black plague during the 14th
Century claimed approximately one-third of the European population (and
more than half of the Asian and Indian populations), plunging the
continent into a darkness from which it took them nearly two centuries
to emerge.41</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">None of this research considers the
impact of declining fossil fuel
production. The authors of all of these studies believe that the
mentioned agricultural crisis will only begin to impact us after 2020,
and will not become critical until 2050. The current peaking of global
oil production (and subsequent decline of production), along with the
peak of North American natural gas production will very likely
precipitate this agricultural crisis much sooner than expected. Quite
possibly, a U.S. population reduction of one-third will not be
effective for sustainability; the necessary reduction might be in
excess of one-half. And, for sustainability, global population will
have to be reduced from the current 6.32 billion people42 to 2
billion-a reduction of 68% or over two-thirds. The end of this decade
could see spiraling food prices without relief. And the coming decade
could see massive starvation on a global level such as never
experienced before by the human race.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">Three Choices</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Considering the utter necessity of
population reduction, there are
three obvious choices awaiting us.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">We can-as a society-become aware of
our dilemma and consciously make
the choice not to add more people to our population. This would be the
most welcome of our three options, to choose consciously and with free
will to responsibly lower our population. However, this flies in the
face of our biological imperative to procreate. It is further
complicated by the ability of modern medicine to extend our longevity,
and by the refusal of the Religious Right to consider issues of
population management. And then, there is a strong business lobby to
maintain a high immigration rate in order to hold down the cost of
labor. Though this is probably our best choice, it is the option least
likely to be chosen.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Failing to responsibly lower our
population, we can force population
cuts through government regulations. Is there any need to mention how
distasteful this option would be? How many of us would choose to live
in a world of forced sterilization and population quotas enforced under
penalty of law? How easily might this lead to a culling of the
population utilizing principles of eugenics?</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">This leaves the third choice, which
itself presents an unspeakable
picture of suffering and death. Should we fail to acknowledge this
coming crisis and determine to deal with it, we will be faced with a
die-off from which civilization may very possibly never revive. We will
very likely lose more than the numbers necessary for sustainability.
Under a die-off scenario, conditions will deteriorate so badly that the
surviving human population would be a negligible fraction of the
present population. And those survivors would suffer from the trauma of
living through the death of their civilization, their neighbors, their
friends and their families. Those survivors will have seen their world
crushed into nothing.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The questions we must ask ourselves
now are, how can we allow this to
happen, and what can we do to prevent it? Does our present lifestyle
mean so much to us that we would subject ourselves and our children to
this fast approaching tragedy simply for a few more years of
conspicuous consumption?</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">

</div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">It sounds like something an insane
doctor might administer to a
depressed plant. Electroshock treatment has been used on plants, but as
a way of deriving useful biochemicals, not for therapy.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The roots of garden pea plants were
exposed to low-level electric
current and subsequently produced 13 times more pisatin, an antifungal
chemical, than plants that were not exposed to electricity.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Joel Cuello, of the University of
Arizona in Tucson, US, says the
technique could be used to generate large amounts of chemicals that
plants typically only produce in trace amounts as a defense against
microbial attack.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">It could be adapted, he says, to make
an inexpensive and efficient
method of producing pharmaceuticals and pesticides.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">'No damage'</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Cuello came up with the idea of
shocking plants after testing a number
of other methods to mimic a biological attack in plants that would
induce chemical production.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">"If [plant] cells are infected with
fungi, they produce these chemicals
as a response to physiological stress," says Cuello of the garden pea
(Pisum sativum). "Anything that stresses the cells should result in
overproduction of whatever they produce in response to that stress," he
adds.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Similar shock treatments applied to
cell cultures of barrel medic
(Medicago truncatula) &#8211; a plant similar to alfalfa &#8211; yielded a 168-fold
increase in production of one chemical and at least a two-fold increase
in 54 other compounds.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">"It's a completely novel approach to
stimulate production of
bio-chemicals in plants," says Fabricio Medina-Bolivar of Arkansas
State University, who was not involved in the study but has examined
other methods of eliciting chemical production in plants.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">"It really opens the door to producing
high-value compounds without
damaging plant tissue that could lead to significant reductions in cost
in producing these compounds," he says.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">Safe method</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">To shock the plants, Cuello applied a
30 to 100 milliamp current to the
growth-medium of plants grown hydroponically, or, in the case of barrel
medic, to the solution surrounding the cell cultures.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Other compounds that have been tested
to stress plant cells include
heavy metals, chemicals such as methyl jasmonate and sodium acetate,
and the cell walls of microorganisms.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">But these methods have drawbacks:
introduced metals and chemical
compounds can taint desired plant chemicals and microbe preparation and
introduction can be costly and time consuming.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">"I thought about electricity because
you can optimise the magnitude and
exposure time of the current," says Cuello, adding that the current he
and colleagues used wouldn't be enough to electrocute a human and
doesn't burn the plant's cells.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">"You just introduce two electrodes and
you can turn it on and off, it's
that convenient," he says.</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Happy cows produce more milk,
according to researchers at Newcastle
University.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Cattle that are named and treated with
a "more personal touch" can
increase milk yields by up to 500 pints a year.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The study, by the university's School
of Agriculture, Food and Rural
Development, involved 516 farmers across the UK.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Published in the journal Anthrozoos,
the study found farmers who named
their cows gained a higher yield than the 54% that did not give their
cattle names.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Dairy farmer Dennis Gibb, who co-owns
Eachwick Red House Farm outside
Newcastle with his brother Richard, said he believed treating every cow
as an individual was "vitally important".</span><br

 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">"We love our cows here at Eachwick and
every one of them has a name.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">"Collectively we refer to them as 'our
ladies' but we know every one of
them and each one has her own personality."</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Dr Catherine Douglas, who led the
research, said: "What our study shows
is what many good, caring farmers have long since believed.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">"Our data suggests that, on the whole,
UK dairy farmers regard their
cows as intelligent beings capable of experiencing a range of emotions.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">"Placing more importance on knowing
the individual animals and calling
them by name can, at no extra cost to the farmer, also significantly
increase milk production."</span><br>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">It is
an ancient slimming remedy with a royal seal of approval.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Now a traditional herb used by King
Charles II to help his mistresses
lose weight could be used in the modern day battle against obesity.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Experts want to re-establish the
humble heath pea to fight the nation's
weight crisis after evidence of its use was discovered during an
archaeological dig.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Heath pea, which is also known as
bitter vetch, was used in medieval
times as a hunger suppressant when the crops failed.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">It was also passed around the court of
King Charles, who gave it to his
lovers who had a propensity for plumpness.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Monks used the plant to treat patients
in the 14th century Soutra Aisle
monastery near Edinburgh, which is currently being excavated.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Dr Brian Moffat, an expert on medieval
remedies, said the idea to
promote heath pea as a slimming aid had been developed after he came
across the remedy during the dig at the Soutra site.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Charles II gave heath pea to his
mistress Nell Gwyn as a hunger
suppressant to keep her weight down</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Dr Moffat, who is director of the dig,
said it appeared the monks cut
up the tubers of the plant to make a potion.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">He said the tubers - which have a
"leathery liquorice" taste - had the
effect of making people forget to eat.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Speaking on a BBC Radio Scotland
documentary to be broadcast next
month, he said: "We have been dealing with some anonymous little
tubers, which have been chopped up in to quarters.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">"The tubers are of heath pea or bitter
vetch.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">"If you ate one of these pea sized
tubers you are meant to 'not eat,
not want to eat and not miss eating for weeks and even in to months'.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">"They were actually used as a measure
to ward off hunger once crops had
failed in the fields.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">"We thought we must take this further
because the plants seemed to
become obsolete really at the time when mass potato cultivation came in.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">"Before that it was a common measure
in crisis.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">"We thought if this can ward off
hunger for weeks in to months, and by
all accounts they are otherwise innocuous, there are possibilities in
this.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">"We have taken our idea forward and
set up a company, just upon the
unlikely assumption that a medieval medicine might have modern
usefulness."</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">He said the commercial possibility
these days would be as a modern
slimming pill for people wanting to lose weight, or for humanitarian
purposes.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Sir Robert Sibbald, joint founder of
the College of Physicians in
Edinburgh and joint founder of the Botanic Gardens, held the plant in
higher esteem than any other.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">He grew it in his therapeutic herbal
collection in 1670.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Dr Moffat added: "We know all about
Heath Pea on the authority of Sir
Robert Sibbald.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">"He was a mainstream medical figure
who actually set out to promote the
heath pea, and in his writings he quite simply gives it more attention
than anything else in Scotland - animal, vegetable or mineral.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">"Sibbald esteemed it high enough that
in his letters to his colleagues
he called it Herba Scotica Miraculosa - the miraculous Scottish herb.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">"It is a plant which is commonly
usually overlooked today. It deserves
a second look."</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Richard Swift, head of the project,
said: "The tubers could help boxers
and other athletes train down to a weight as well as helping dieters
exercise and lose weight.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">"There could be a good long term
market for the tubers."</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Heath Pea (Lathyrus linifolius) is
normally found in poor grazing and
heath land. It sometimes grows alone, but it can also grow in clumps on
banks and verges of roads and tracks.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The plants take two or three years to
mature but require very little
looking after. </span><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Introduction: Baba Vanga, born
Vangelia Goushterova, (31 January 1911 -
11 August 1996) was a famous Bulgarian prophet that lived in the Rupite
area in Rila Mountain, Bulgaria.</span><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Today many people know about Vanga,
the Bulgarian prophet. Her gift is
even in her name, which makes many wonder: translated from Greek,
Vangelia means Herald of the Blessed Word. Vanga, truly, who, one
newspaper wrote, is "the most fantastic reality and the most enigmatic
truth." Her talent of prophecy has thrown many into shock. Her gifts
are unique, she has the gift to foresee, clairvoyance, and she could
talk with flowers, visit different places on the earth. She saw much,
even though she was blind, and her face emanated light.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Vanga was born and lived in Bulgaria
in the town of Petrich. During her
childhood, she was an ordinary girl and did not know about her gifts.
The life of Vanga is like the lives of the Saints, although it's hard
to imagine that an earth-born could stand such calamities like the ones
that happened to the poor Bulgarian prophet. In the First World War her
father was drafted into the Bulgarian Army, and her mother died when
she was too young. The young girl depended on the neighbours for a long
time. Vanga was smart, with blue eyes and blond hair. When she was
young, she loved every subject having its own place. Her gifts were
hidden somewhere deep inside her. She herself thought out games and
loved playing "healing". She prescribed her friends some herbs. When
Vanga was 11 years old, she thought out a strange game, which seemed
dangerous to her father. Vanga put something on the street or in the
house, then put her hands on her eyes imitating blindness, and began to
searching for it. Although her father prohibited playing blind, she
continued.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Her father being a widower, married
eventually a good woman and gave a
stepmother to his daughter. Her father was an animal-farmer, and she
had to drive the milk-can. Once, there was a big storm. The sky was
dark, the wind was blowing and it rooted up the trees. The storm wind
lifted Vanga up and threw her in the field. She was found after a long
search. She was very frightened, and her eyes were covered with sand
and dust, so she couldn?t open them; she was in great pain. No healing
gave results. There were no money for operation, and her eyesight was
failing. Vanga was crying, begging God for a miracle. Then, she did not
know that the miracle had already happened.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">In 1925 Vanga was driven to the Blind
House, where she spent 3 years.
After the death of her second mother she had to go back home, to take
care of her little brothers and sisters. Her family was very poor. The
day was filled with work, and the night with tears. The supernatural
gifts of Vanga appeared step-by-step, nobody noticed the date of their
coming, but many had remembered later, how she helped her father find a
sheep stolen from the flock. She simply described the yard, where the
sheep was hidden. Everybody was astonished, and Vanga said that she
dreamt of it. She herself noticed that she had dreams about bad events
and then they became real. Her talent was developed mostly in the years
of the Wars. Desperate, sad people went to her seeking a few calming
words or any hint where their relatives died.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Her older brother Vasil joined a
partisan party. Vanga cried and begged
him not to go, telling him that he would be killed at the age of 23.
But Vasil did not believe her. He went in June and in October he
surrendered to the Germans. He was tortured, and then executed.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Vanga explained her extraordinary
abilities with the presence of
invisible creatures but she couldn't explain their origin. They gave
her this information about people, which she could not transmit to
them, because distance and time didn't matter. The life of everyone
standing in front of her, was like a film for her, from birth till
death. But to make something to change this, what was written "on the
generation," was not in her power. Beyond prophecy Vanga understood,
that she could heal illness, but only with herbal medicines. She
prescribed washing with infusion from herbs and spices, because they
heal better through the skin. Vanga did not ever say anything against
mainstream medicine, although she thought that taking too much medicine
is bad, because "they close the doors, through which nature restores
the balance in the body with herbs."</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Herbs and flowers were here favorite
medicines. In the medicine Vanga
made a huge place for them. But she said that people had to heal
themselves only with the herbs from the country they live in. Her
prescriptions helped many people. Vanga was not afraid of death. She
told that there is no death: "I have told you, that after death the
body decomposes, like everything alive, but a part of the body the
soul, or something I don?t know how to call it, does not decompose. You
talk about second birth. I do not know what it is. But what remains
from a man - it's the soul. It does not decompose, and continues to
develop to reach higher states. This is the eternity of soul." (part of
a conversation with a theatre man)</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Many witnesses remembered about the
contacts Vanga made with dead
people. A man asked her why she is talking about his dead mother, and
she replied: "You have not taken it with you. They come on their own,
because for them, I am a door to this world. When somebody comes to me,
his dead relatives are around him, ask me questions and answer, and I
only tell the living what I heard." Vanga never allowed anybody to seek
revenge. She believed that a man is born to make good. No bad thing
ever remains unpunished. It is always punished and if it does not
affect the man who made the wrong, it affects his children. Vanga made
prophesies of newborn or unborn children. She saw and talked to people,
who died 100, 200 and more years ago. As the scientists say - this is
the most fantastic of the prophecy.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Vanga talked about the future,
although she did not like to. In her
words: in 200 years man will make contact with brothers in mind from
other worlds. She even said that many aliens have been living on the
earth for years. Where they came from? From the planet, which in their
language is called WAMFIM. This is the third planet from the Earth. Not
so long ago, Vanga left this world. But she left a good memory of her.
She died on the 11 August 1996. Vanga knew the date exactly, and before
she died she said, that a gift like hers was received by a 10-year old
blind girl living in France and that we will soon hear about her.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">There are not many people who believe
in clairvoyants&#8217; predictions.
However, such beliefs stay strong until those predictions begin to come
true. As for the predictions of the Bulgarian remote-viewer and healer
Vanga (Vangelia Gushterova), people began to listen out for her words
long ago. Vanga presumably became known for her predictions of global
disasters.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">For example, Vanga predicted the 9/11
terrorist attacks in the United
States, when she said that American brothers would fall under attacks
of birds of steel. The clairvoyant also predicted the beginning of
WWII, the perestroika in the USSR, the death of Princess Diana and even
the sinking of the Kursk submarine.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Specialists also say that the renowned
fortune-teller also predicted
the events connected with the armed conflict in South Ossetia. Vanga
supposedly said that the Third World War would break out as a result of
attempts on the lives of four government heads and after a conflict in
Hindustan.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The presidents of four countries &#8211;
Ukraine, Estonia, Lithuania and
Poland departed to Georgia in the middle of the conflict to see the
situation with their own eyes.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Vanga predicted that the Third World
War would break out in 2010.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Vanga was illiterate or semi-literate
and she did not write any books
herself. Her speech was difficult to distinguish and she spoke a heavy
dialect (recent TV recordings used subtitles for the Bulgarian
audience). What she said or allegedly said has been captured by staff
members. Later numerous esoteric books on Vanga's life and predictions
were written.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Vanga claimed that her alleged
extraordinary abilities had something to
do with the presence of invisible creatures, but she couldn't clearly
explain their origin. She was saying, that those creatures were giving
her information about people, which she could not transmit to them,
because, distance and time didn't matter. According to Vanga, the life
of everyone standing in front of her, was like a film to her, from
birth till death. But changing "what was written on the generation" was
beyond her power.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Apart from prophesying, Vanga was
believed to be a healer, but only
through herbal medicines. According to her, people had to heal
themselves only with herbs from the country they live in. She
prescribed washing with an infusion of herbs and spices, claiming some
beneficial effect on the skin. Vanga did not oppose mainstream
medicine, although she thought that taking too many medicines is bad,
because "they close the doors, through which nature restores the
balance in the body with herbs".</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Vanga attempted prophesies of newborn
or unborn children. She claimed
that she was "seeing" and "talking" to people, who had died hundreds of
years ago. Vanga talked about the future, although she did not like to.
In her words, in 200 years man will make contact with brothers in mind
from other worlds.[citation needed] She said that many aliens have been
living on the earth for years. They came from the planet, which in
their language is called Vamfim, and is the third planet from the Earth.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Followers of Vanga believe that she
knew the precise date of her own
death, and shortly before that she had said that a 10-year-old blind
girl living in France was to inherit her gift, and that people would
soon hear about her.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Many [heads of government], including
Hitler, visited her and it is
reported that "der F&uuml;hrer" left her house looking upset.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Vanga&#8217;s most shocking prediction
include:</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">&#8220;At the turn of the century, in August
of 1999 or 2000, Kursk will be
covered with water, and the whole world will be weeping over it.&#8221; (1980)</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The prediction did not make any sense
back then. Sadly, twenty years
on, it did make a lot of sense, when a Russian nuclear submarine sunk
in an accident in August of 2000. The submarine was named Kursk. Kursk
- the city (after which the submarine was named), could by no means
have been covered with water (probably that&#8217;s why her prediction seemed
so unrealistic at first).</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">&#8220;Horror, horror! The American brethren
will fall after being attacked
by the steel birds. The wolves will be howling in a bush, and innocent
blood will be gushing.&#8221; (1989)</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Happened as predicted. The World Trade
Center Towers in New York
collapsed following terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. The WTC
Towers were dubbed &#8220;Twins&#8221; or &#8220;Brothers.&#8221; The terrorists drove
passenger planes &#8211;&#8220;the steel birds&#8221;- into the towers. &#8220;The bush&#8221;
obviously relates to the surname of the current U.S. president.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Below I&#8217;m including a big article
about the predictions that she made
about the future, and for visitors who don&#8217;t speak Russian, I&#8217;ve
translated each prediction she had made word to word, with text in ( )
being not my comment but the comment by the editor of a newspaper&#8230; You
can either laugh and dismiss it, or take it word to word and become
paranoid. The fact is no one knows whether any of it is going to come
true or not, so i guess we&#8217;ll have to wait and see, but your comments
are welcome.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">

<div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">A
hormone known as the "love drug" makes men with good memories of early
childhood more nostalgic about their mother's love, say scientists.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">By </span><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Stephen Adams, </span><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Medical Correspondent</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
</div>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">But oxytocin, which is produced in the
brain, makes men with bad memories of their mothers even more critical
of them, psychiatrists found.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Dr Jennifer Bartz and colleagues from
Mount Sinai Medical Centre in New York studied the responses of 31 men
to the hormone, which is released in large quantities when men and
women are in love.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">They asked them to complete
questionnaires about how well they felt their mothers treated them as
children, both before being given oxytocin and afterwards.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;Dr Bartz said those who recalled
being "closer to their mother" tended to exaggerate the maternal bond
after taking the hormone, while the effect on those whose memories
invoked "anxiety" was the opposite.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Studies on oxytocin, which is also
secreted in abundance in the brains of breastfeeding women, have tended
to conclude it is a general mood enhancer.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Writing in the Proceedings of the
National Academy of Sciences, Dr Bartz noted: "These data suggest
caution when hypothesising about the effects of oxytocin for different
individuals or as an intervention.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">"On one hand, we found that oxytocin
exacerbated chronic concerns about closeness and the reliability of
close others that characterize attachment anxiety.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">"On the other hand, less anxious
participants clearly showed a beneficial response to oxytocin,
remembering their relationship with their mother in childhood in a more
positive light.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">"Oxytocin is popularly dubbed the
'hormone of love', but these data suggest that oxytocin is not an
all-purpose attachment panacea."</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Earlier this year scientists unveiled
a synthetic oxytocin spray that they said made men more affectionate
and empathetic, which has been touted as a possible solution for people
with autism. Sprays are available to buy on the internet.</span><br>

</big><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
A nasal spray could cure shyness, a new study suggests.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">By Richard Alleyne<br>
Science Correspondent</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">

<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Scientists have discovered that the
hormone oxytocin could help wallflowers overcome awkwardness in social
situations</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The chemical dubbed "the hormone of
love" is known to increase empathy and bonding &#8211; especially parents and
their children.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">But now researchers have found it
improves the social skills of the shy &#8211; but has little effect on those
who are naturally confident.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The finding could have implications
for those with severe social deficiencies, often apparent in conditions
like autism.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Researchers at Israel's Seaver Autism
Center for Research and Treatment and Columbia University were
examining whether the hormone, which occurs naturally in the body could
make us more understanding of others.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">They conducted a test of 27 healthy
adult men, giving them the hormone or a placebo via a nasal spray and
then asking them to perform an 'empathic accuracy task' - which
measures their powers of reading the thoughts and feelings of others.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">This involved watching others
discussing emotional moments in their lives, then rating how they felt
those people were feeling.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The scientists, whose research is
published in Psychological Science, also measured the participants'
social competency, using a test known as AQ which is usually used in
autistic patients.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">They found that oxytocin did improve
powers of empathy &#8211; but only among those who were less socially
proficient in the first place.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The more socially comfortable
participants performed well on the empathetic task regardless of
whether they were on oxytocin or placebo.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">But less socially proficient
participants performed significantly better on oxytocin, with their
empathetic powers performance identical to that of the more outgoing
participants.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Prof Jennifer Bartz, of the Mount
Sinai School of Medicine, said: "Oxytocin is widely believed to make
all people more empathetic and understanding of others.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">"Our study contradicts that. Instead,
oxytocin appears to be helpful only for those who are less socially
proficient.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">"Our data show that oxytocin
selectively improves social cognition in people who are less socially
proficient, but had little impact on more socially proficient
individuals.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">"While more research is required,
these results highlight the potential oxytocin holds for treating
social deficits in people with disorders marked by deficits in social
functioning like autism."</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">

<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Researchers have found that in the
heat of battle they have the same chemicals running through their
bloodstreams as protective mothers, meaning they develop incredibly
strong bonds with each other but become extremely aggressive to
outsiders.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The effect resolves around the hormone
oxytocin which is released at times of stress and when people socialise
with each other.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">But the scientists have found that
this chemical, often referred to as the love or bonding hormone, also
makes them &#8211; like mothers &#8211; incredibly aggressive to outsiders.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Using a computer simulation game they
found that volunteers given a spray of the hormone bonded more quickly
and deeply with their own group but became much more hostile to
outsiders.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Dr Carsten De Dreu, of the University
of Amsterdam, said that the phenomenon was known as "parochial
altruism" or "tend and defend".</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">This meant that boosted levels of
oxytocin produced "in-group love" and "out-group aggression", he said.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Dr De Dreu, who published the findings
in Science, said: "Oxytocin is a double edged sword. It makes you
kinder to your group but more aggressive to those outside."</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Dr De Dreu thinks that the production
of oxytocin, which increases at times of stress and in new mothers, has
evolved since hunter gathering times when food was scarce and groups
had to compete to survive.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">He said: "Being aggressive to
threatening out-groups makes you a hero, loyal and a patriot to your
own group."</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Holly Arrow, an expert in the
psychology of war at the University of Oregon, said: "Oxytocin is
perhaps an important pathway that bonds men together and makes them
ready to defend the group."</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">In three experiments, all on male
volunteers, they compared the choices of individuals who received a
dose of oxytocin via nasal spray with those who received a placebo.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The volunteers were assigned to
three-person groups and introduced to a game in which they made
confidential decisions that had financial consequences for themselves,
their fellow group members and the competing groups.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The results indicated that oxytocin
drives a &#8220;tend and defend&#8221; response, promoting in-group trust and
co-operation and defensive, but not offensive, aggression toward
competing out-groups.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The hormone appears to have this
effect regardless of how naturally co-operative people are.</span><br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">What is &#8220;humanure&#8221;?</span><br>
Humanure (human manure) is human fecal material and urine. It is a
major source of environmental pollution around the world. It is also a
source of disease organisms. When discarded into the environment as a
waste material, it creates pollution and threatens public health. When
recycled, the pollution and health threats can be eliminated. Humanure
also contains valuable soil nutrients that can enhance plant growth.
For these reasons, humanure should be recycled whenever possible.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">How can humanure be recycled?</span><br>
Humanure can be recycled in two basic ways. First, it can be applied
raw to agricultural land. In this case, humanure may be called &#8220;night
soil.&#8221; Unfortunately, raw applications of human excrement to soil can
still create pollution and spread disease, so this method of recycling
is strongly discouraged.<br>
<br>
The second method of recycling humanure is through a process called
&#8220;composting.&#8221; This is the process used by the humanure compost toilet
system described in this manual.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">What is composting?</span><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">What are organic materials?</span><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">How does one feed these materials to
compost organisms?</span><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Humanure Toilets</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br>
A humanure toilet is a collection device and not a waste disposal
device. The purpose of a humanure toilet is to collect human fecal
material and urine so that the toilet material can be composted. Also
collected in the toilet are all toilet paper as well as paper tubes
from the center of the toilet paper rolls (if any). All urine is
collected in<br>
the humanure toilet and not diverted for collection elsewhere. Also
collected in a humanure toilet are vomit (when sick), and baby diaper
fecal material (scraped off the cloth diaper into the humanure toilet).
Collect food scraps in a separate compost container and deposit them
directly into the same outdoor compost bin. If you collect food scraps
in the humanure toilet, you risk a fruit fly infestation.<br>
<br>
The humanure toilet should be constructed to look like a normal toilet
with a toilet seat. It should be located in a private, comfortable
setting, indoors during cold weather or year-round. The collection
container should have a minimum 20 liter capacity. When properly used,
the humanure toilet will create no unpleasant odors.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">How can a humanure toilet not create
bad odors?</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br>
When any foul smelling material is deposited into a humanure toilet, it
is covered with a clean organic material in order to prevent odor,
absorb moisture and prepare the material for composting. This is how
humanure is mixed with the other organic materials that allow it to be
composted &#8212; by covering it. No manual mixing, stirring or digging of
the humanure is required, only covering. Therefore, the clean organic
materials used in the toilet are called &#8220;cover materials.&#8221; The cover
materials used in the toilet should have a somewhat dry and fine
consistency. Sawdust from trees (rather than dry boards) is ideal, but
other materials can be used depending on what is locally available.
Some areas utilize rice hulls, others utilize coco coir, peat moss,
rotted leaves, etc., even shredded junk mail. Proper cover materials
are absolutely essential to the successful operation of a humanure
toilet.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Can wood ashes be used as a cover
material?</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br>
Wood ashes or coal ashes should not be used as a cover material in
humanure toilets, nor should they be used for making compost. Compost
organisms do not digest such materials. Clean wood ashes (wood ashes
without plastic or other garbage burned in the fire) are good for the
soil. They should be spread over a garden area or saved in an outdoor
pile or in a fire-proof container for later garden use, but not added
to a compost pile.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">How much humanure can be collected
in a 20 liter container?</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br>
A 20 liter container will collect about one week&#8217;s worth of human fecal
material and urine, including cover material, produced by one adult.
Human excrement is mostly liquid. The liquid will fill in the spaces
between the cover material as the toilet container fills up. When using
a humanure toilet, a clean layer of cover material should be kept over
the toilet contents at all times. The simple rule to follow is this: if
the toilet contents have an odor, add more cover material until there
is no odor.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">How is the humanure composted?</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br>
The collected toilet material is taken to a compost bin and added to
the bin&#8217;s contents. If a single adult were using a humanure toilet with
a proper cover material, he or she would produce one full toilet
receptacle once a week. For an average family of four, four toilet
receptacles would be filled per week. For every 20 liter container of
toilet material produced, an equal container of organic cover material
will be necessary. When the toilet user also composts the toilet
material, under normal circumstances, it should take about 20 minutes
to empty and clean four toilet containers. The job of humanure
composting should be conducted by a single family member who is trained
in the use of humanure toilets, although other family members can also
assume this responsibility if they have also undergone proper training.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Building a Humanure Toilet</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br>
The humanure toilet is only one part of a three part compost toilet
system. Those three parts include the toilet, the cover material and
the compost bin(s). All three are necessary for the humanure compost
toilet system to work properly.<br>
<br>
The humanure toilet is a collection device. In order to prevent
environmental pollution caused by humanure and in order to compost
humanure, it must be collected before it comes into contact with the
natural environment.<br>
<br>
It is therefore collected in a waterproof container for the purpose of
depositing it into a contained composting environment. No composting
occurs in the toilet itself. The toilet collection receptacle should be
a minimum 20 liters in capacity because this size container can be
easily moved by one person when full. If a container of this size is
too heavy for one person when full (for example, when moved by a small,
elderly person), then the receptacle can be carried and emptied before
it is full.<br>
<br>
Some compost toilet systems locate the toilet directly above a compost
pile to eliminate the need for a portable toilet receptacle. However,
this is difficult to do indoors without a long-term odor problem and it
is considerably more complicated and expensive than the humanure toilet
discussed in these instructions. Therefore, such a system is not the
subject of this manual.<br>
<br>
The toilet receptacle can be enclosed in a moveable box-like structure,
or it can be permanently built into a toilet cabinet for stability and
aesthetics. As stated earlier, four receptacles should be used with the
toilet and more if the population served by the toilet is greater than
four people. Or, for every person who regularly uses the toilet, there
should be a toilet receptacle available for use. For an average family
of four people, this means four receptacles. The toilet box or cabinet
is built to fit the toilet receptacle, which is why it is important to
have the receptacles on hand when the toilet is built. Twenty liter (5
gallon) receptacles come in all sizes and shapes. If the toilet is
built to fit one particular receptacle, that does not mean it will fit
a different receptacle. If a replacement receptacle is two centimeters
higher than the original receptacle, for example, then the toilet seat
will not go down flat. So begin the toilet construction by first
acquiring a minimum of four toilet receptacles, with lids, that are
exactly the same size and shape.<br>
<br>
Next, build the box or cabinet. A box creates a moveable toilet and a
cabinet is permanently built into a wall.<br>
<br>
The most convenient form of box or cabinet is one with a hinged lid
that allows for easy removal of the compost receptacle. There are a few
simple rules to follow when building a toilet box or cabinet. First,
the top of the toilet receptacle should nearly come in contact with the
bottom of the toilet seat ring. Therefore, the height of the toilet box
is critical and the box has to be built to fit the height of the
particular container that you have acquired.<br>
<br>
Secondly, the front edge of the toilet seat ring should line up with
the front edge of the toilet box. These two design elements are
important because of human anatomy. If the toilet receptacle does not
come nearly into contact with the underside of the toilet ring, then
urine can be ejected above the toilet receptacle, especially by young
boys while defecating. If the toilet seat ring is situated too far back
from the front of the toilet box, then urine can be inadvertently
deposited on top of the front of the box, thereby causing it to
deteriorate prematurely. For a good, solid, long-term toilet, the top
board should be a single piece of wood, such as a piece of exterior
plywood. This wood should be painted, varnished, or otherwise sealed
for long-term performance and for easy cleaning. The side pieces can be
wood, new or salvaged, of various sizes depending on availability and
personal preference. The length of the legs is what determines the
height of the box. Illustrated instructions on how to build a humanure
compost toilet box are available on the internet at
humanurehandbook.com. Examples of owner-built humanure compost toilets
are also shown, as are video clips of humanure<br>
composting and humanure toilet construction.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Acquiring the Cover Materials</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">How To Build a Compost Bin</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br>
The simplest compost bin would be a single bin of a maximum 1.5 meters
square and 1 to 1.5 meters high with an open top and one side
removable. The open side should be closed off
to animal access. This can be achieved by using removable boards or
even bales of hay or straw to
close the open side. The open side covering can be raised as the level
of the compost rises, in order to hold the
compost into the bin. If the top of the compost is accessible to
chickens, dogs, etc., it should also be
covered. A simple wire mesh cover will prevent the compost from being
disturbed by animals and it is easily removable
when adding compost to the pile. The compost bin itself can be built
from scrap wood boards, wire mesh,
bales of hay or straw, other recycled materials, or even masonry
materials.<br>
<br>
A humanure compost toilet system can be used in the same location for
generations. Therefore, the most serious composters will construct a
permanent bin. A minimum three bin system
is recommended. One bin is filled for a one year period, then it is
left to age. Another bin is filled
for one year as the first bin ages. The first bin is gradually emptied
as the second bin nears filling. By the time the
second bin is full, the first bin is empty again and the cycle starts
all over. The third bin, which would be the center
bin, is used to store cover materials. This bin should be covered in
order to keep the cover material dry in the
winter months so the material won&#8217;t freeze.<br>
<br>
A roof over the center bin can also be used for rain water collection,
with the water being conveniently used for cleaning compost toilet
receptacles. A rain water collection system,
however, must be drained during freezing weather.<br>
<br>
The bins should be constructed on a slightly concave soil base so
leachate, if any, will be contained. The soil base also acts as a
conduit for soil organisms to enter the compost.<br>
When scrap lumber is used for the sides of the compost bins, the lumber
will eventually rot. When this happens, the lumber should simply be
replaced. Do not use lumber that is treated
with chemicals for the compost bins. The object of the bins is to
provide a suitable home for compost
microorganisms. Toxic chemicals do not suit that objective. Examples of
compost bins are shown at
humanurehandbook.com.<br>
