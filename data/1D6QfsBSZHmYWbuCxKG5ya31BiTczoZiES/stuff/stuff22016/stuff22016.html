      </b>Light-emitting diodes are in widespread use in both commercial
      and residential settings. New research shows that applying a small
      magnetic field to some devices can boost their luminescence
      efficiency.<br>
      <b><br>
      </b><b>Abstract</b><br>
      <br>
      As carriers slowly move through a disordered energy landscape in
      organic semiconductors, tiny spatial variations in spin dynamics
      relieve spin blocking at transport bottlenecks or in the
      electron-hole recombination process that produces light. Large
      room-temperature magnetic-field effects (MFEs) ensue in the
      conductivity and luminescence. Sources of variable spin dynamics
      generate much larger MFEs if their spatial structure is correlated
      on the nanoscale with the energetic sites governing conductivity
      or luminescence such as in coevaporated organic blends within
      which the electron resides on one molecule and the hole on the
      other (an exciplex). Here, we show that exciplex recombination in
      blends exhibiting thermally activated delayed fluorescence
      produces MFEs in excess of 60% at room temperature. In addition,
      effects greater than 4000% can be achieved by tuning the device’s
      current-voltage response curve by device conditioning. Both of
      these immense MFEs are the largest reported values for their
      device type at room temperature. Our theory traces this MFE and
      its unusual temperature dependence to changes in spin mixing
      between triplet exciplexes and light-emitting singlet exciplexes.
      In contrast, spin mixing of excitons is energetically suppressed,
      and thus spin mixing produces comparatively weaker MFEs in
      materials emitting light from excitons by affecting the precursor
      pairs. Demonstration of immense MFEs in common organic blends
      provides a flexible and inexpensive pathway towards magnetic
      functionality and field sensitivity in current organic devices
      without patterning the constituent materials on the nanoscale.
      Magnetic fields increase the power efficiency of unconditioned
      devices by 30% at room temperature, also showing that magnetic
      fields may increase the efficiency of the thermally activated
      delayed fluorescence process.<br>

      ultraviolet radiation. Researchers investigate, for the first
      time, the ultrafast molecular dynamics of nitrogen as it
      disassociates…<br>
      <br>
      <b>Abstract</b><br>
      <br>
      Studying the interaction of molecular nitrogen with extreme
      ultraviolet (XUV) radiation is of prime importance to understand
      radiation-induced processes occurring in Earth’s upper atmosphere.
      In particular, photoinduced dissociation dynamics involving
      excited states of N2+ leads to N and N+ atomic species that are
      relevant in atmospheric photochemical processes. However, tracking
      the relaxation dynamics of highly excited states of N2+ is
      difficult to achieve, and its theoretical modeling is notoriously
      complex. Here, we report on an experimental and theoretical
      investigation of the dissociation dynamics of N2+ induced by
      isolated attosecond XUV pulses in combination with
      few-optical-cycle near-infrared/visible (NIR/VIS) pulses. The
      momentum distribution of the produced N+ fragments is measured as
      a function of pump-probe delay with subfemtosecond resolution
      using a velocity map imaging spectrometer. The time-dependent
      measurements reveal the presence of NIR/VIS-induced transitions
      between N2+ states together with an interference pattern that
      carries the signature of the potential energy curves activated by
      the XUV pulse. We show that the subfemtosecond characterization of
      the interference pattern is essential for a semiquantitative
      determination of the repulsive part of these curves.<br>

      </div>
      <br>
      As previously reported on by Interesting Engineering, airloys and
      aerogels are proving to be the future of super-materials. In
      recent developments, scientists can now make the incredibly light
      solid out of cellulose fibers from recycled paper, making it
      biodegradable. Typically, aerogels and airloys are expensive to
      make due to their usual composition of silica gel and the process
      required to create the solid. This new method offers up a cheap,
      green alternative to the aerogel industry, possibly bringing the
      material’s usefulness to the next level.<br>
      <br>
      The process to make the new aerogel is surprisingly simple,
      involving the breakdown of paper shreds into cellulose using
      water, developed by the National University of Singapore. Once
      broken down, water and a polymer resin is added to begin forming
      the shape and rigidity of the solid. Water is then extracted from
      the mix using a high frequency sound machine. From this point, the
      material is subjected to freezing for 24 hours, then air-drying,
      with the process finishing with curing in an oven at 114 °C for 3
      hours.<br>
      <br>
      This process results in a cellulose based aerogel that is 98.2 %
      air, yet still flexible and super insulative. A chemical coating
      can also be applied to make the material hydrophobic...<br>

      <div align="center"><b>WO2014178797</b><br>
        <b>Polysaccharide Aerogel</b><br>
      </div>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
      Inventor: DUONG HAI MINH, et al.<br>
      <br>
      A polysaccharide based aerogel comprising a network of
      polysaccharide fibers with pores therebetween, wherein the sizes
      of the pores are in the micrometer range.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Background</b><br>
      <br>
      Aerogels are dried gels that are extremely light, with properties
      such as high porosities and large surface areas. Materials that
      are typically used for aerogels Include silica, carbon, alumina or
      chalcogens. However, silica aerogels are extremely brittle and
      processes to form the above aerogels are costly, with some
      processes requiring solvents that are toxic to the environment.<br>
      <br>
      Due to the low thermal conductivity of the aerogels, they have
      been investigated for use as thermal insulators . Greenhouse
      effect has been warming up the earth and threatening human life.
      It was found that C02emission from buildings contributed more than
      30% of greenhouse gas emission in developed countries in 2005.
      Buildings also accounted for 39 % of energy consumption in this
      year. Improving thermal insulation of buildings is one of the most
      effective solutions for the issue. Therefore, there have been many
      efforts in developing new insulation materials. Silica aerogels
      have been proposed as insulation materials for buildings. However,
      they are very brittle. A flexible aerogel-based insulation
      material (based on a composite containing methylsilylated Silica
      and polyethylene terephthalate) has been developed but it is much
      more expensive than conventional insulation materials . High
      energy consumption, climate changes and the depletion of fossil
      fuels require more sustainable and energy efficient construction
      solutions. In order to meet the demand of improved energy
      efficiency, the thermal insulation of building plays an important
      role. To achieve better thermal insulation with current insulation
      materials, thicker walls are expected. However, this will increase
      the building cost and affect several issues like floor area,
      architectural restrictions, etc. As a result, it is essential to
      develop cheaper insulation materials with low thermal conductivity
      for construction applications. In tropical climates, high humidity
      is an additional factor affecting the lifetime of buildings. As
      the moisture content in the surrounding air is high, this may
      facilitate the growth of harmful microorganisms such as mould or
      bacteria that can cause allergy or respiratory problems. In
      addition, the high humidity of the air may cause condensation to
      form on surfaces that are exposed to the outside air such as
      windows, walls or ceilings, which can be colder than the outside
      air (due to the use of air- conditioners indoors) . The condensed
      moisture potentially damages building materials.<br>
      <br>
      While aerogels have limited applications in environmental cleanups
      such as cleaning chemical spills or removal of heavy metals from
      water, they have not been extensively investigated for use in
      other types of environmental contamination.<br>
      <br>
      In order to clean up oil spills, sorbets have been used instead as
      an alternative to or together with traditional methods such as
      booms, skimmers, dispersants or burning. However, these
      traditional methods are not very effective to remove the oil
      completely from the water and are expensive. Sorbents for oil
      removal can be classified as inorganic mineral, synthetic organic
      and natural organic materials. The absorption capacities of common
      absorbents like polypropylene can be up to 25 times of their
      weight. However, the high cost and low biodegradability are the
      main drawbacks of this technique.<br>
      <br>
      Aerogels also find limited use in applications that require the
      absorption of water. Due to the hygroscopic nature of aerogels
      such as silica aerogels, when the silica aerogels are placed in
      liquid water, the aerogel structure actually collapses due to the
      exertion of strong capillary forces by the absorbed water, leading
      to fracture of the solid silica backbone. Superabsorbent polymers
      are used instead to absorb water. Superabsorbent polymers are
      materials that have the ability to absorb and retain large volumes
      of water. As a result, they are used in water absorbing
      applications such as baby diapers and feminine napkins . They can
      swell in water to form rubbery gels that can be up to 99 wt%
      water. However, the absorbed water can only be removed by drying
      and the absorbents are not biodegradable .<br>
      <br>
      There is a need to provide an aerogel that overcomes, or at least
      ameliorates, one or more of the disadvantages described above ...<br>
      <b><br>
        Example 1</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>Synthesis of cellulose aerogels</b><br>
      <br>
      The raw material used for the synthesis of cellulose aerogels was
      recycled cellulose fibers (see Fig. 1(a)) from paper waste.
      Recycled cellulose fibers were obtained from Insul-Dek Engineering
      Pte. Ltd. of Singapore. Recycled cellulose fibers (1.2 to 4 wt%)
      was dispersed in sodium hydroxide/urea solutions (1.5 to 3 wt% of
      NaOH with 10 to 20 wt% of urea, both chemicals obtained from
      Sigma-Aldrich of Missouri of the United States of America) by
      sonicating for 6 minutes. A probe sonicator was used for
      sonicating the mixture at a frequency of 20 to 25kHz and at a
      power of 1800 W. After sonication, the solution was placed in a
      refrigerator at a temperature of -14°C for more than 24 hours to
      allow gelation of the solution. After the solution has formed a
      gel, it is then thawed at room temperature (of about 25°C) and
      then followed by immersing into ethanol (99%) which functions as a
      coagulation solvent for coagulation. In order to control the
      thickness of the aerogel, a beaker was used as a mold to control
      the thickness at 1 cm and a diameter of 3.5 cm.<br>
      <br>
      After coagulation, solvent exchange was carried out by immersing
      the gel in de- ionised water for 2 days. To dry the sample without
      destroying the structure, freeze drying was carried out. In this
      technique, the sample was frozen and the surrounding pressure was
      reduced to allow the frozen water in the sample to sublimate
      directly from the solid phase to the gas phase, which creates
      minimal force on the pore walls of the aerogel, thereby preventing
      the porous structure from collapsing. Here, the sample was frozen
      in a freezer at -18°C for 12 hours. After this, freeze drying was
      carried out for 2 days with a ScanVac CoolSafe 95-15 Pro freeze
      dryer (from LaboGene™ of Denmark) to obtain the desired cellulose
      aerogel, as shown in Fig. 1(b). Referring to Fig. 1(b), a light
      and porous aerogel was formed after the freeze drying step. The
      aerogel may also be termed hereinafter as "cellulose aerogel" or
      "recycled cellulose aerogel".<br>
      <br>
      Field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) was used to
      investigate the morphology of the cellulose aerogel prepared from
      recycled cellulose fibers. Here, the sample was kept in a dry
      cabinet prior to FE-SEM. The sample was then coated with a thin
      gold layer using sputtering. A Hitachi S4300 scanning electron
      microscope (from Hitachi of Japan) operated at 1/5 kV was used to
      capture structural images of the cellulose aerogel. As seen in
      Fig. 1(c), the cellulose aerogel has an open porous network
      structure of uniform fibers (about 8 μπι wide) , indicating that
      the recycled cellulose fibers successfully self-assembled via
      hydrogen bonding to form a three-dimensional (3D) porous network.
      The width of the recycled cellulose fibers is much larger than
      that of nanocellulose fibers (2 to 100 nm) . From Fig. 1(c), it
      can be observed that the pore size of the pores in the cellulose
      aerogel is in the range of 40 to 200 μπι, indicating the porous
      property of the cellulose aerogel. It is to be noted that aerogels
      formed using nanocellulose fibers are nanoporous, rather than
      having micron-sized pores .<br>
      <br>
      The cellulose aerogel has a density of 0.078
      g/cm&lt;3&gt;calculated from the weight (0.9690 g) and volume
      (12475mm&lt;3&gt;) of the cellulose aerogel (please refer to Table
      1 below) . With a cellulose fiber density of 1.5 g/cm&lt;3&gt;,
      the porosity of the cellulose aerogel sample is 94.8%. This value
      is lower than that of cellulose aerogels made from nanocellulose
      fibers, probably due to the micron-sized porous structure of the
      recycled cellulose aerogel compared to the nanoporous network of
      the nanocellulose aerogel. Example 2<br>
      <br>
      <b>Water Absorption Capability</b><br>
      <br>
      ...The third water absorption test was then carried out. The
      volume of the wet sample after the third test was similar to that
      of the wet sample after the second test (Table 1) indicating that
      no more shrinkage was created in the structure of the aerogel. As
      a result, the absorbed water amount in the third time was almost
      the same of that in the second time. A mrvalue of 0.999 of the
      third water absorption test again indicated that nearly all the
      absorbed water was eliminated after a simple squeezing...<br>

      <b>Example 3</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>Flexibility of Cellulose Aerogel</b><br>
      <br>
      To investigate the flexibility of the recycled cellulose aerogel,
      a test was performed on a cellulose aerogel sample synthesized
      from 1.2 wt% recycled cellulose fibers and 1.5wt% NaOH/10wt% urea,
      sonicated for 6 minutes. As shown in Fig. 3(a), the <b>cellulose
        aerogel can be easily and repeatedly bent 180 degrees without
        damaging the shape of the sample</b> .<br>
      <br>
      A qualitative test was performed for the cellulose aerogel sample
      to investigate its mechanical strength by loading a 200 g weight
      on the sample (Fig 3 (b) ) . It can be seen that the aerogel did
      not change its shape under the heavy loading.<br>
      <br>
      For further understanding of the mechanical property of the
      cellulose aerogel, tensile and compression tests were performed
      with an Instron&lt;®&gt;5500 microtester (from Instron&lt;®&gt;of
      Massachusetts of the United States of America) and the results are
      shown in Fig. 3(c) and Fig. 3(d). The size of the cellulose
      aerogel sample was 38 mm (diameter) by 11 mm (thickness) . The
      sample was compressed at a rate of 1 mm/min.<br>
      <br>
      From Fig. 3 (c) , it can be seen that the yield strength and
      tensile strength of the aerogel are about 1080 N/m&lt;2&gt;and
      1470 N/m&lt;2&gt;, respectively, with a Young' s modulus of 11
      kPa.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>Hydrophobic Cellulose Aerogel</b><br>
      <br>
      Cellulose aerogels synthesized from the method of Example 1 were
      used to develop hydrophobic recycled cellulose aerogels. Here, the
      cellulose aerogels were synthesized from 1.2 wt% recycled
      cellulose fibers and 1.5wt% NaOH/10wt% urea, sonicated for 6
      minutes<br>
      <br>
      For water repellent coating, two different coating methods -
      physical and chemical, were used. In the physical coating method,
      a commercial water repellent spray (ReviveX&lt;®&gt;Nubuck,
      obtained from Gear Aid of McNett Corporation of Washington of the
      United States of America) was used to spray the dried aerogel from
      a distance of 15 cm and then left to dry for one day at room
      temperature. As shown in Fig. 5(a), the surface of the aerogel was
      covered by the water repellent polymer and all the pores on the
      surface (but not within the structure) were fully covered.<br>
      <br>
      In the second method - the chemical method (chemical vapor
      deposition method), a recycled cellulose aerogel sample was placed
      in a big glass bottle. A small open glass vial containing
      methyltrimethoxysilane (MTMS) was added into the glass bottle. The
      glass bottle was then capped and heated in an oven at 70°C for 2
      hours for the silanation reaction. After that, the coated sample
      was placed in a vacuum oven to remove the excess coating reagent
      until the pressure reaches 0.03 mbar. As shown in Fig. 5(b), in
      contrast to Fig. 5(a), the MTMS- functionalized sample still had a
      porous structure.<br>
      <br>
      After being coated with MTMS, the MTMS-coated aerogel shows a
      thermal conductivity value of 0.029 Wm^K&lt;"1&gt;, which is lower
      than the thermal conductivity of the uncoated sample (0.032
      Wm^K&lt;"1&gt;) , indicating an improvement in the thermal
      insulation property due to the MTMS coating...<br>
      <br>
      <b>Synthesis of Aerogel from Pure Cellulose Fibers</b><br>
      <br>
      Pure cellulose fibers (1.2 wt%, obtained from Sigma- Aldrich) were
      dispersed in sodium hydroxide/urea solutions (1.5 wt% of NaOH with
      10 wt% of urea) by stirring for 15 minutes. The solution was
      placed in a refrigerator for more than 24 hours to allow gelation
      of the solution. The gel was then thawed at room temperature (of
      about 25°C) and then followed by immersing into ethanol (99%) for
      coagulation. In order to control the thickness of the aerogel, a
      beaker was used as a mold to control the thickness at 1 cm and a
      diameter of 3.5 cm. After coagulation, solvent exchange was
      carried out by immersing the gel in de-ionised water for 2 days.
      To dry the sample without destroying the structure, freeze drying
      was carried out. The sample was frozen in a freezer at -18°C for
      12 hours. After this, freeze drying was carried out for 2 days
      with a ScanVac CoolSafe 95-15 Pro freeze dryer to obtain the
      desired cellulose aerogel.<br>
      <br>
      The cellulose aerogel synthesized from pure cellulose fibers had
      pores that were in the nanosized range. In addition, the diameter
      of the pure cellulose fibers was in the range of 5 to 20 nm, with
      length of up to several micrometer.<br>
      <br>
      The pure cellulose aerogel was subjected to a flexibility test and
      it was found that the aerogel was not flexible and was brittle.
      The sample broke easily after the test.<br>
      <br>
      In addition, the pure cellulose aerogel was subjected to the same
      oil absorption test as mentioned in Example 6 and it was found
      that the oil absorption capacity of this aerogel was 10 g/g.<br>
      <br>
      Hence, as compared to cellulose aerogels synthesized from recycled
      cellulose fibers, the pure cellulose aerogel had a lower oil
      absorption capacity (which is most probably due to the smaller
      pores in the aerogel) and was inflexible ...<br>

      The most versatile material in the world may be here, and it’s
      going to change everything. Aerogels have been around for a while,
      but new innovations have made the technology even better and more
      useful. An aerogel is a low-density solid created through the
      extraction of liquid from gel using the process of supercritical
      drying. Most commonly, aerogels are made of silica, yet this
      material makes the super-light solid incredibly brittle. After
      years of research, scientists from NASA and other independent
      companies have created a new product, airloy.<br>
      <br>
      Airloys combine the strength and durability of conventional
      plastics with the light weight, super-insulating properties seen
      in aerogels. Part of what makes this material so promising is its
      ability to be engineered for the extremes. Airloys are ultra low
      density, .01 to .9 g/c², which makes them the lightest solids on
      earth. Accompanying this low density are super-insulative
      properties and extreme material strength. Certain polymer based
      airloys can be engineered to handle an excess of 20,000 times
      their own weight. The difference between aerogels and airloys is
      demonstrated best in the video below.<br>
      <br>
      The super-insulative properties observed in the material are
      astounding scientists, and are making thin lightweight insulation
      materials a possibility. Not only does this material insulate
      against temperature, but sound as well. In fact, as an acoustic
      insulator, this material is 100 to 1000 times better than any
      other product on the market. NASA has developed a thin flexible
      airloy, shown below, for use in spacesuits and rocket
      technologies.<br>

          SILICA AEROGELS</b><br>

      <b><br>
      </b><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      Aerogels are chemically inert, highly porous ceramic materials.
      Generally, these materials are produced by forming a gel
      containing a solvent and a porous solid component, and then
      removing the solvent to leave behind the porous solid. Removal of
      the solvent while preserving the porous solid structure is
      difficult because the gel often shrinks upon removal of the
      solvent and causes the porous solid structure to crack and break.
      This obstacle has been overcome by transforming the solvent within
      the gel into a vapor above its supercritical point, and allowing
      the vapor to escape and leave the intact porous solid structure.
      The first true aerogels were producted by exchanging water in the
      gel with alcohol that was then converted to a supercritical fluid
      and allowed to escape. This produced an aerogel that was
      transparent, low density, and highly porous. A major advance took
      place when this technique was combined with the application of
      sol-gel chemistry to prepare silica aerogels. This process
      replaced the sodium silicate that was typically used with an
      alkoxysilane, (for example, tetramethyorthosilicate, TMOS).
      Hydrolyzing TMOS in a solution of methanol produced a gel in one
      step that was called an “alcogel”. This eliminated two of the
      drawbacks of the previously used procedure, namely, the
      water-to-alcohol exchange step and the presence of inorganic salts
      in the gel. Drying these alcogels under supercritical alcohol
      conditions produced high-quality silica aerogels. In subsequent
      years, this approach was extended to prepare aerogels from a wide
      variety of metal oxide aerogels.<br>
      <br>
      Recent advances have produced aerogels that are the product of a
      sol-gel process, whose final stage involves extracting the
      pore-filling solvent with liquid CO2. The latter is gasified
      supercritically and is vented off, leaving behind a very low
      density solid (0.002-0.8 gram/cm&lt;−3&gt;), with the same volume
      as the original hydrogel and a chemical composition identical to
      glass.<br>
      <br>
      Aerogels have been considered for thermal insulation, catalyst
      supports, or as hosts for a variety of functional materials for
      chemical, electronic, and optical applications. However, practical
      application of aerogels has been slow because aerogels are brittle
      and hygroscopic. These properties cause several known aerogels to
      absorb moisture from the environment which causes them to collapse
      due to the capillary forces developing in the pores. Therefore,
      aerogels having superior strength characteristics that would
      overcome the deficiencies of the past would be useful in a large
      variety of applications...<br>
      <br>
      <b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      In one example, the invention provides silica aerogel monoliths
      wherein the strength has been improved by a factor of over 100
      through cross-linking the nanoparticle building blocks of
      preformed silica hydrogels with a cross-linking agent, such as
      poly(hexamethylene diisocyanate). The composite monoliths of the
      invention offer the advantage that they are much less hygroscopic
      than native silica, and they do not collapse when contacted with
      liquids.<br>
      <br>
      Base-catalyzed silica aerogels typically consist of large voids
      (mesopores, ̃50 nm in diameter) in a “pearl-necklace” network of
      microporous, so-called secondary particles (Brinker and Scherer,
      Sol-Gel Science; The Physics and Chemistry of Sol-Gel Processing,
      Academic Press: New York, (1990)) which are the smallest entities
      visible in FIG. 2A (5-10 nm in diameter). Those particles are
      connected by “necks” formed by dissolution and reprecipitation of
      silica during aging (Brinker and Scherer, Sol-Gel Science; The
      Physics and Chemistry of Sol-Gel Processing, Academic Press: New
      York, (1990); Woignier and Phalippou, J. Non-Cryst. Solids, (1998)
      100, 404-408). Reasonably, the strength of monolithic aerogels
      could be improved by making the necks wider. To accomplish this
      with minimum addition of new material, the contour surface of
      silica can be used as a template for the deposition and growth of
      the interparticle cross-linker.<br>
      <br>
      Silica is surface-terminated with silanols (—SiOH). A
      polyurethane, (—CONH—R—NHCOOR/O—)n, is formed by the reaction of a
      diisocyanate (OCN—R—NCO) and a diol (HO—R′—OH) (Smith and March,
      March's Advanced Organic Chemistry Reactions, Mechanism and
      Structure; John Wiley and Sons: New York, 2001). A similar
      reaction of an isocyanate cross-linking agent with the free
      hydroxyl groups of a sol-gel like material provides cross-linked
      aerogels having superior properties that allow them to be used in
      a large variety of applications.<br>
      <br>
      <b>I. General Preparation of Aerogels from Silicon Alkoxide
        Precursors</b><br>
      <br>
      The formation of aerogels, in general, involves two major steps,
      the formation of a sol-gel like material, and the drying of the
      sol-gel like material to form an aerogel. Originally, sol-gel like
      materials were made by the aqueous condensation of sodium
      silicate, or a similar material. While this process worked well,
      the reaction formed salts within the gel that needed to be removed
      by many repetitive washings (a long, laborious procedure). With
      the rapid development of sol-gel chemistry over the last few
      decades, the vast majority of silica aerogels prepared today
      utilize silicon alkoxide precursors. The most common of these are
      tetramethyl orthosilicate (tetramethoxysilane, TMOS, Si(OCH3)4),
      and tetraethyl orthosilicate (tetraethoxysilane, TEOS,
      Si(OCH2CH3)4). However, many other alkoxides, containing various
      organic functional groups, can be used to impart different
      properties to the gel. Alkoxide-based sol-gel chemistry avoids the
      formation of undesirable salt by-products, and allows a much
      greater degree of control over the final product. The balanced
      chemical equation for the formation of a silica gel from TEOS is:<br>
      Si(OCH2CH3)4 (liq.)2H2O(liq.)=SiO2 (solid)+4HOCH2CH3 (liq.)<br>
      <br>
      The above reaction is typically performed in ethanol, with the
      final density of the aerogel dependent on the concentration of
      silicon alkoxide monomers in the solution. Note that the
      stoichiometry of the reaction requires two moles of water per mole
      of TEOS. In practice, this amount of water leads to incomplete
      reaction, and weak, cloudy aerogels. Most aerogel recipes,
      therefore, use a higher water ratio than is required by the
      balanced equation (anywhere from 4-30 equivalents).<br>
      <br>
      <b>Catalysts</b><br>
      <br>
      The kinetics of the above reaction are impractically slow at room
      temperature, often requiring several days to reach completion. For
      this reason, acid or base catalysts are added to the formulation.
      The amount and type of catalyst used play key roles in the
      microstructural, physical and optical properties of the final
      aerogel product.<br>
      <br>
      Acid catalysts can be any protic acid, such as HCl. Basic
      catalysis usually uses ammonia, or ammonia buffered with ammonium
      fluoride. Aerogels prepared with acid catalysts often show more
      shrinkage during supercritical drying and may be less transparent
      than base catalyzed aerogels. The microstructural effects of
      various catalysts are harder to describe accurately, as the
      substructure of the primary particles of aerogels can be difficult
      to image with electron microscopy. All generally show small (2-5
      nm diameter) particles that are generally spherical or egg-shaped.
      With acid catalysis, however, these particles may appear “less
      solid” (looking something like a ball of string) than those in
      base-catalyzed gels. As condensation reactions progress, the sol
      will set into a rigid gel. At this point, the gel is usually
      removed from its mold. However, the gel should typically be kept
      covered by alcohol to prevent evaporation of the liquid contained
      in the pores of the gel. Evaporation causes severe damage to the
      gel and will lead to poor quality aerogels<br>
      <br>
      <b>Single-Step vs. Two-Step Aerogels</b><br>
      <br>
      Typical acid or base catalyzed TEOS gels are often classified as
      “single-step” gels, referring to the “one-pot” nature of this
      reaction. A more recently developed approach uses pre-polymerized
      TEOS as the silica source. Pre-polymerized TEOS is prepared by
      heating an ethanol solution of TEOS with a sub-stoichiometric
      amount of water and an acid catalyst. The solvent is removed by
      distillation, leaving a viscous fluid containing higher molecular
      weight silicon alkoxides. This material is redissolved in ethanol
      and reacted with additional water under basic conditions until
      gelation occurs. Gels prepared in this way are known as “two-step”
      acid-base catalyzed gels. Pre-polymerized TEOS is available
      commercially in the United States from Silbond Corp. (i.e.,
      Silbond® H-5).<br>
      <br>
      These slightly different processing conditions impart subtle, but
      important changes to the final aerogel product. Single-step base
      catalyzed aerogels are typically mechanically stronger, but more
      brittle, than two-step aerogels. While two-step aerogels have a
      smaller and narrower pore size distribution and are often
      optically clearer than single-step aerogels.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Aging and Soaking</b><br>
      <br>
      When a sol reaches the gel point, it is often assumed that the
      hydrolysis and condensation reactions of the silicon alkoxide
      reactant are complete. This is far from the case. The gel point
      simply represents the time when the polymerizing silica species
      span the container containing the sol. At this point the silica
      backbone of the gel contains a significant number of unreacted
      alkoxide groups. In fact, hydrolysis and condensation can continue
      for several times the time needed for gelation. Failure to
      realize, and to accommodate this fact is one of the most common
      mistakes made in preparing silica aerogels. Sufficient time must
      be given for the strengthening of the silica network. This can be
      enhanced by controlling the pH and water content of the covering
      solution. Common aging procedures for base catalyzed gels
      typically involve soaking the gel in an alcohol/water mixture of
      equal proportions to the original sol at a pH of 8-9 (ammonia).
      The gels are best left undisturbed in this solution for up to 48
      hours.<br>
      <br>
      This step, and all subsequent processing steps, are typically
      diffusion controlled. That is, transport of material into, and out
      of, the gel is unaffected by convection or mixing (due to the
      solid silica network). Diffusion, in turn, is affected by the
      thickness of the gel. In short, the time required for each
      processing step increases dramatically as the thickness of the gel
      increases.<br>
      <br>
      After aging the sol-gel like material, all water still contained
      within its pores should be removed prior to drying. This is simply
      accomplished by soaking the sol-gel like material in a solvent,
      such as alcohol, several times until the water is removed. Again,
      the length of time required for this process is dependent on the
      thickness of the sol-gel like material. Any water left in the gel
      will not be removed by supercritical drying, and will lead to an
      opaque, white, and very dense aerogel.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Supercritical Drying</b><br>
      <br>
      The final process in making silica aerogels is typically
      supercritical drying. This is where the liquid within the sol-gel
      like material is removed, leaving only the linked silica network.
      The process can be performed by venting the ethanol above its
      critical point (high temperature-very dangerous) or by prior
      solvent exchange with CO2 followed by supercritical venting. This
      process should be performed in an autoclave specially designed for
      this purpose (small autoclaves used by electron microscopists to
      prepare biological samples are acceptable for CO2 drying). The
      process is as follows. The sol-gel like materials are placed in
      the autoclave (which has been filled with ethanol). The system is
      pressurized to at least 750-850 psi with CO2 and cooled to 5-10
      degrees Celsius (C). Liquid CO2 is then flushed through the vessel
      until all the ethanol has been removed from the vessel and from
      within the sol-gel like materials. When the sol-gel like materials
      are ethanol-free the vessel is heated to a temperature above the
      critical temperature and pressure of CO2 (31° C. and 1050 psi
      respectively). As the vessel is heated the pressure of the system
      rises. The system is held at these conditions for a short time
      followed by the slow, controlled release of CO2 to ambient
      pressure. As with previous steps, the length of time required for
      this process is dependent on the thickness of the gels. The
      process may last anywhere from a few hours to several days.<br>

      FIG. 1 shows the process conditions for both the carbon dioxide
      substitution/drying process and the alcohol drying process.<br>

      What, you may ask, is aerogel? Aerogels are the world's lightest
      solid materials, composed of up to 99.98% air by volume. Aerogels
      are a diverse class of amazing materials with properties unlike
      anything else. Transparent superinsulating silica aerogels exhibit
      the lowest thermal conductivity of any solid known. Ultrahigh
      surface area carbon aerogels power today's fast-charging
      supercapacitors. And ultrastrong, bendable x-aerogels are the
      lowest-density structural materials ever developed.<br>

      distinct locations, separated by a specific distance not less than
      [1/8] the fundamental acoustic wavelength. Various combinations of
      acoustic wavelength, ferromagnetic material type, and source of

      </b><b>Abstract</b><br>
      <br>
      Glasses with high elastic moduli have been in demand for many
      years because the thickness of such glasses can be reduced while
      maintaining its strength. Moreover, thinner and lighter glasses
      are desired for the fabrication of windows in buildings and cars,
      cover glasses for smart-phones and substrates in Thin-Film
      Transistor (TFT) displays. In this work, we report a
      54Al2O3-46Ta2O5 glass fabricated by aerodynamic levitation which
      possesses one of the highest elastic moduli and hardness for oxide
      glasses also displaying excellent optical properties. The glass
      was colorless and transparent in the visible region, and its
      refractive index nd was as high as 1.94. The measured Young’s
      modulus and Vickers hardness were 158.3 GPa and 9.1 GPa,
      respectively, which are comparable to the previously reported
      highest values for oxide glasses. Analysis made using 27Al Magic
      Angle Spinning Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (MAS NMR) spectroscopy
      revealed the presence of a significantly large fraction of
      high-coordinated Al in addition to four-coordinated Al in the
      glass. The high elastic modulus and hardness are attributed to
      both the large cationic field strength of Ta5+ ions and the large
      dissociation energies per unit volume of Al2O3 and Ta2O5.<br>

        Project Overview</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Our design concept aims to take on the problem of food stores
      spoiling in areas with poor access to electricity. The goals of
      our alternate food preservation unit are to not require an
      electricity grid, to be significantly less expensive than a modern
      refrigeration methods and to be able to be incorporated into the
      regions of poverty where it is most needed. The cooling mechanism
      is inspired by temperature regulation approaches seen in mammals
      and insects and is a new way of approaching issues in the food
      system. Coral and termites inspired the first step, kangaroos,
      bees, and elephants the second, and lastly meerkats and burrowing
      animals and leaves the third. In our process an intake structure
      passively draws in air warm ambient air and injects it via the
      venture effect it into a pipe. The second step delivers the air
      into the evaporation chamber, where the pipe is immersed in a
      fluid. The fluid evaporating from the around pipe cools the inside
      air and lastly the third step involves the cooled air entering the
      refrigeration chamber where food is stored.<br>
      <br>
      In adhering to life's principles we have been able to come up with
      the WindChill Food Preservation Unit. It is a tool for not only
      keeping food at low temperatures, but also for changing the lives
      of the people that use it, those who make it and changing the
      future of the food transportation system through an exciting
      proposal for ambitious implementation and development. By
      emulating nature and creating conditions conducive to life we
      believe we have come up with a project can change the world of
      those who need it.<br>

      A team from the University of Calgary came up with a clever way to

      electricity. Jorge Zapote explains how the WindChill works. <br>

        <br>
      </b>Four students in the Schulich School of Engineering looked to
      kangaroos, explored elephant’s ears and studied termites’ nests to
      build a food preservation system that won first prize at an
      international biomimicry design challenge. <br>
      <br>
      WindChill is a cheap, simple device that can keep food cold and
      help people in the developing world who don’t have access to
      electricity. By using biomimicry — sustainable design inspired by
      nature — the students developed a cold food chamber that can
      prevent food from spoiling in remote, poverty-stricken parts of
      the world.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Device mimics how animals regulate their body temperatures</b><br>
      <br>
      The students looked at different ways that animals and insects
      regulate their body temperatures. Take elephants for example:
      “They get their ears wet and when the water evaporates it cools
      their skin,” says Jorge Zapote, a third-year biomedical
      engineering student. “Kangaroos lick their forearms and when it
      evaporates off their skin, it cools their blood and they also dig
      and put their bellies in exposed ground and that cools them down.”<br>
      <br>
      Armed with these and other observations from nature, the students
      — Cissy Cheng, second-year mechanical engineering; Mitchell Weber,
      second-year electrical engineering; and Michelle Zhou third-year
      chemical engineering — created the WindChill. The device starts
      with a funnel that draws outside air into a pipe. The pipe is
      immersed in a fluid. The fluid evaporates, cooling the air, which
      is then sent to an underground refrigeration chamber.<br>

      “What’s great about this is that it’s a global competition; there
      were 70 plus entries from around the world,” says Marjan
      Eggermont, associate dean (student affairs) and a senior
      instructor at Schulich. “For a group of undergrads from Calgary to
      win is fantastic.”<br>
      <br>
      Eggermont, who also designs ZQ, an award-winning magazine about
      biomimicry, worked with the students to finish their design.<br>
      <br>
      “Biomimicry helps develop more sustainable solutions,” she says.
      “Because nature doesn’t tend to foul its own backyard, you come up
      with solutions that can work locally and are benign to the
      environment.”<br>

      <div align="center"><b>Iron-gallium alloy shows promise as a
          power-generation device</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      An alloy first made nearly two decades ago by the U. S. Navy could
      provide an efficient new way to produce electricity. The material,
      dubbed Galfenol, consists of iron doped with the metal gallium. In
      new experiments, researchers from UCLA, the University of North
      Texas (UNT), and the Air Force Research Laboratories have shown
      that Galfenol can generate as much as 80 megawatts of
      instantaneous power per square meter under strong impacts. The
      team describes the findings, which could lead to the development
      of wireless impact detectors and other applications, in a paper in
      the Journal of Applied Physics.<br>
      <br>
      Galfenol is a magnetoelastic material—one in which the state of
      magnetization can be changed by squeezing, pushing or otherwise
      deforming the material. Conversely, when exposed to a magnetic
      field, magnetoelastic materials respond by changing shape. If the
      materials are prevented from deforming—for example, by being held
      in a clamp—they instead will generate a large force.<br>
      <br>
      "In general this means a magnetoelastic material can convert
      mechanical energy into magnetic energy, and vice versa," explained
      John P. Domann, a mechanical engineering graduate student at UCLA
      and first author of the paper. Galfenol converts energy with high
      efficiency; it is able to turn roughly 70 percent of an applied
      mechanical energy into magnetic energy, and vice versa. (A
      standard car, by contrast, converts only about 15 to 30 percent of
      the stored energy in gasoline into useful motion.) Significantly,
      the magnetoelastic effect can be used to generate electricity. "If
      we wrap some wires around the material, we can generate an
      electrical current in the wire due to a change in magnetization,"
      Domann said.<br>
      <br>
      As described in the new paper, Domann and his colleagues—including
      his Ph.D. advisor, Gregory P. Carman, a professor of mechanical
      and aerospace engineering at UCLA, and Bradley E. Martin from the
      Air Force Research Laboratories at Eglin Air Force Base in
      Florida—assessed the power-generating ability of Galfenol in
      experiments using a device called a Split-Hopkinson Pressure Bar
      to generate high amounts of compressive stress (e.g., powerful
      impacts). They found that when subjected to impacts, Galfenol
      generates as much as 80 megawatts of instantaneous power per cubic
      meter.<br>
      <br>
      By way of comparison, a device known as an explosively driven
      ferromagnetic pulse generator produces 500 megawatts of power per
      cubic meter. However, as their name implies, such generators
      require an explosion—one that destroys the ferromagnet, even as it
      produces power. "Destroying a material requires a lot of wasted
      energy, creating only one-shot devices," Domann said. "This
      wasteful energy and destruction is not a concern in our method
      using Galfenol, meaning our devices can be used repeatedly and
      cyclically."<br>

      Among the potential applications, Galfenol-powered devices could
      be used as wireless impact detectors. "Essentially, we could
      fabricate small devices that send out a detectable electromagnetic
      wave when a mechanical pulse moves through it," Domann said. These
      devices could be embedded in vehicles—military or civilian—to
      detect collisions. Because electromagnetic waves travel three
      orders of magnitude faster than mechanical waves, information
      about the impact could be transmitted ahead of the waves created
      by the impact. "In this manner, we could wirelessly determine that
      an impact has occurred, before the majority of the vehicle (or any
      passengers) even have time to feel it. This would allow a fast
      computer to take actions mitigating damage or injury," he added.<br>
      <br>
      Although the concept requires further analysis and testing,
      commercial technologies based on the idea could see the market
      within just a few years, the researchers said.<br>

      This paper presents the experimental measurements of a highly
      magnetoelastic material (Galfenol) under impact loading. A
      Split-Hopkinson Pressure Bar was used to generate compressive
      stress up to 275 MPa at strain rates of either 20/s or 33/s while
      measuring the stress-strain response and change in magnetic flux
      density due to magnetoelastic coupling. The average Young's
      modulus (44.85 GPa) was invariant to strain rate, with
      instantaneous stiffness ranging from 25 to 55 GPa. A lumped
      parameters model simulated the measured pickup coil voltages in
      response to an applied stress pulse. Fitting the model to the
      experimental data provided the average piezomagnetic coefficient
      and relative permeability as functions of field strength. The
      model suggests magnetoelastic coupling is primarily insensitive to
      strain rates as high as 33/s. Additionally, the lumped parameters
      model was used to investigate magnetoelastic transducers as
      potential pulsed power sources. Results show that Galfenol can
      generate large quantities of instantaneous power (80 MW/m3 ),
      comparable to explosively driven ferromagnetic pulse generators
      (500 MW/m3 ). However, this process is much more efficient and can
      be cyclically carried out in the linear elastic range of the
      material, in stark contrast with explosively driven pulsed power
      generators.<br>

      The Christ in substance, the perfect matrimony, and sanctity
      constitute the perfect synthesis of all the religions of the
      world.<br>
      <br>
      When all the religions of the world have disappeared, the cosmic
      Christ and sanctity—the synthesis that is indestructible, and the
      eternal of all eternity—will continue to exist.<br>
      <br>
      In the Aquarian age, the dogmatic type of Christianity will no
      longer be taught. In Aquarius, all dogmatic forms will disappear.
      In the new era, Christ will be comprehended as a substance. <br>
      <br>
      In the new Aquarian age, everything will be atomic and explosive.
      People will then be prepared to study the doctrine of the
      synthesis. Science will be religious, and religion will be
      scientific. Arguments related to the subjects of the spirit and
      matter will disappear, and people will comprehend that both spirit
      and matter are modifications of the universal energy.<br>
      <br>
      In the Aquarian age, devices will be invented to see egos that
      have disembodied. <br>
      <br>
      There shall be a collision of magnetic fields of worlds. Our
      Earth's magnetic field will collide with that of another planet.
      This event will put an end to the present Aryan race.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Root Races</b><br>
      <br>
      The entire Earth will then go through a total and definite
      transformation. The selected, the chosen, will be secretly saved,
      and they shall serve as seeds for the sixth race.<br>
      <br>
      This collision of magnetic fields of worlds is not new. In archaic
      times, the Earth had a similar collision. At that time, our Earth
      was closer to the Sun, and was flung by the collision to the place
      it occupies now.<br>
      <br>
      The age that is about to begin will be governed by Aquarius. This
      sign governs the Earth's atmosphere. Aquarius is in the house of
      Uranus, which we know is atomic and explosive. Therefore, what
      will happen is approaching our atmosphere and is explosive. <br>
      <br>
      The Earth and all its elements will burn intensely with fire. The
      ancient Earth was destroyed by water, and the present Earth will
      be destroyed by fire. In this manner, all the written prophecies
      in all the sacred books of all religions, of east and west, of
      north and south, will be fulfilled. The word of all those who
      incarnated the Cosmic Christ will be totally fulfilled.<br>
      <br>
      In the Aquarian age, atomic wars fought to death will take place.
      The Third World War will be a fact. The result of all these wars
      will be terrible: horrible earthquakes, seaquakes, unknown
      illnesses, hunger, misery, etc.<br>
      <br>
      Very soon, man will conquer the Moon. It is necessary to know that
      man will reach other planets with his rockets. It is urgent to
      comprehend that when the man of Aquarius manages to arm a powerful
      fleet of cosmic ships to violently invade other planets in space,
      then on that day shall be fulfilled all the prophecies of those
      who incarnated the Cosmic Christ in substance. That shall be the
      day of the collision of worlds, the mountains made dust will fly
      through the air, and all that has life shall perish by fire.<br>
      <br>
      The men of the future Earth, the men of the future great race, the
      men of the sixth race that will appear after the great cataclysm,
      will have to begin their lives in the caverns of the transformed
      Earth of this modern civilization, for everything will be
      destroyed. When everything has been destroyed, when the Aryan race
      has disappeared, only the doctrine of the synthesis shall continue
      to exist.<br>

      <div align="center"><b>Samael Aun Weor interview about 2012, the
          end of the World and the Prophecies of Maya</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Question – Master Samael Aun Weor: why has there been so much
      emphasis inthe year 1999? Even you mentioned it as you talked
      about Count Saint Germain. Nostradamus also mentions it as a year
      that will be “decisive for humanity”. What could you tell us about
      it?<br>
      <br>
      Answer of Master Samael Aun Weor :&nbsp; 1999 is a significant
      date. Nostradamus identifies 1999 as the year of the great
      catastrophe. He assures “a terrible king will assault Paris from
      the skies”. He refers, without a doubt, to Hercolubus, and “Paris”
      is deeply symbolical. He refers to our planet Earth in general.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Nostradamus</b><br>
      <br>
      Nostradamus said “Earth will appear as if it were forced out of
      its orbit” (referring to that year) and that there would be “great
      darkness”. Without a doubt he refers to an eclipse. Obviously, as
      Hercolubus falls between the Earth and the Sun, an eclipse has to
      happen. Everyone, all students who have read his “Centurias” await
      the date. However, the Mayans affirm that only during the KATUN 13
      will come that great catastrophe, and they await that to happen
      during the year 2043.<br>
      <br>
      As you can see, there are two concepts in question; one is from
      Michael de Nostradamus and the other from the Mayans of the
      Yucatan Peninsula. I personally believe this can all happen during
      the KATUN 13. I stand behind theMayans.<br>
      <br>
      Question: When it is spoken of the year 2.500 as the year in which
      the present fifth race will be finished, have we take it as a
      symbolic number or is it due to any chronology?<br>
      <br>
      Answer of Master Samael Aun Weor : It is symbolic, and for that
      reason we have mentioned it in the "Secret Doctrine of Anahuac".
      It is a symbolic date which coincides with the moment in which the
      seventh seal of Saint John's Apocalypse is torn. It means that the
      seventh seal is torn because 5 plus 2 is seven. The humanity has
      torn 6 seals till the present moment, the it has to tear the
      seventh seal and it is said, symbolically, that it is the year
      2.500, but it has not to be taken literally, no.<br>
      <br>
      The beginning of the definitive catastrophe is in the year 2.043
      because the Thirteenth Katun (on the Mayans) starts in 2.043. It
      is written and all the wise men of the mayas know it.<br>
      <br>
      I asked an old Maya man from Palenque: "Will your son see it?" and
      then the old man answered: "No, my son will not see it." "Will
      your grandson see it?" He answered: "My grandson will see it."<br>
      <br>
      The Thirteenth Katun, as with the other twelve Katuns will be
      accomplished to the letter. Each one of the twelve Katuns has been
      exact, none has failed.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;The Thirteenth Katun will start between 2.040 and 2.043,
      more or less, that is what the Mayans say.<br>
      <br>
      Question: In the year 2.043?<br>
      <br>
      Answer of Master Samael Aun Weor :&nbsp; Yes, between 2.040 and
      2.043 the thirteenth Katun starts. We are in the twelfth Katun, we
      haven't reached the thirteenth yet. During the thirteenth Katun
      comes the maximum closeness of Hercolubus. It is clear that, when
      approaching in an exaggerated way our planet, it will cause
      catastrophes because it is a very big planet, many thousands,
      almost millions of times, bigger than the Earth.<br>
      <br>
      It is a monster, w ich as approaching our orbit, at the rate, so
      exaggeratedly, that is doing, it will turn over the Earth
      completely. The Earth will not resist it. But before the
      catastrophe happens, before turning it over, with its magnetic
      power, Hercolubus will attract the liquid fire which is in the
      interior of the Earth. This liquid fire, when coming to the
      surface, spreads over the terrestrial crust and burns it totally;
      nothing will be left without being burnt, it burns everything.<br>
      <br>
      So that, everything being burnt, the whole of humanity will
      perish. It will be the day of the great universal fire,&nbsp;
      prophesied<br>
      by Michael of Nostradamus,<br>
      by Peter the Apostle, when he said: "The elements, burning, will
      be destroyed, and the Earth and all the works which are on it,
      will be burnt;"<br>
      by Jesus of Nazareth in his prophetic sermon;<br>
      &nbsp;by the Mayans in their thirteenth Katun;<br>
      by the Nahuatls when they say that the sons of the fifth sun will
      perish by means of fire and earthquakes.Say, it is prophesied
      again and again by everybody (there is a lot of documentation on
      it) that all the terrestrial crust will be burnt totally, that
      none will survive.<br>
      <br>
      <b>The pole shift</b><br>
      <br>
      Now, at the maximum of Hercolubus' closeness it will cause a
      revolution of Earth's axis.<br>
      <br>
      There is, then, a complete movement, the poles will become the
      equator and vice-versa.<br>
      The Earth will turn somersaults, it will be something terrible.An
      extraterrestrial said that if they blow up Hercolubus (they have
      the methods and the could do it) the catastrophe could be so
      terrible that it would destroy all this solar system. You can see
      how big Hercolubus is…<br>

      <div align="center"><b>Prophecies of Mahavatar Babaji</b><b> about
          the Great Revolution and the end of the World</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      (extract from the book Teachings of Babaji)<br>
      <br>
      <b>26 JULY 1979 (Herakhan)</b><br>
      <br>
      Some important observations made by Sri Babaji on the future world
      events.<br>
      <br>
      The change of the present, which is full of turmoil, will be
      brought about by bloody revolution. Peace will return only after
      the revolution reaches its zenith.<br>
      <br>
      In the aftermath of the revolution-which will be total; no country
      will be spared big or small-some countries will be totally erased,
      leaving no sign of their existence.<br>
      <br>
      In some 3% to 5% and up to maximum of 25% of the population will
      be spared and will survive.<br>
      <br>
      Earthquakes, floods, accidents, collisions and wars will bring
      about the destruction.<br>
      <br>
      The destructive elements, which were kept in cheek by Sri Babaji,
      have been released to do their worst.<br>
      <br>
      Those who pray to their chosen divinity will not be affected.<br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      <b>28 JULY 1979 (Herakhan)</b><br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      Giving reference to his earlier prediction Shri Babaji foretold
      that the revolution (like a scythe) will be total and will be from
      one end of the world to another. Revolution spoken about on
      26-7-1979, will increase in tempo, and will reach its culmination
      point. It will not be confined to any particular country, but the
      whole world will be engulfed, big and small countries alike.<br>
      <br>
      People today are full of misery and unhappiness. Misery and
      unhappiness is not confined to the poor, but rich people are
      affected too. All are suffering from difficulties, misery, and
      unhappiness. The leaders of all countries are busy safeguarding
      their positions and have totally ignored their people needs and
      interests. These leaders are misguiding the public. There is
      complete insecurity. There is no safety of person or property. New
      leaders are being trained and prepared to take over from U the
      (corrupt) leaders who will restore just and proper order and bring
      peace.<br>
      <br>
      At present, demonic influences have engulfed men. Man will fight
      and devour men and they will destroy each other. First,
      destruction will take place, then a lull and then peace will
      prevail. Some of the countries will be completely destroyed.
      Prayer will be the only safeguard and saviours against
      destruction.<br>
      <br>
      Forget past and future, abolish all other thoughts, but pray with
      total concentration of mind and soul and have full faith in God.<br>
      Chant OM NAMAH SHIVAYA and you can defy death. Have no thought
      about your life and death.<br>
      No evil influence will ever come near you if you pray with purity
      of heart and mind and with all faith and concentration.<br>
      <br>
      <b>7 NOVEMBER 1981</b><br>
      <br>
      After the evening Aarati, Shri Babaji spoke to His assembled
      devotees about the coming times. Shri Babaji asked that we all
      have courage and that we all become like lions. "We should do our
      work with courage. " He stressed the importance of Karma Yoga. "
      Karma Yoga is what will make you like lions; it will make you
      strong in this life."<br>
      <br>
      "Don't disappoint Babaji. Don't be afraid of death, nor of the
      storm of water and fire. This life itself is water and fire. Don't
      try to stop it, but rather become like lions."<br>
      <br>
      Babaji went on to say that He doesn't need many people; He just
      needs a few people who are really brave. "Be strong in the time of
      great revolution which is coming. <br>
      <br>
      No one can stop the fire coming in the world now. The bells of
      great destruction are already ringing. The war will be such that
      people sleeping will die immediately. There will be atomic war.
      People will die immediately in their houses from gas and atomic
      and nuclear radiation."<br>
      <b><br>
      </b><b>5 MAY 1982</b><br>
      <br>
      Babaji again cautions us to be alert. A great revolution is
      coming. It is not of the ordinary type. Between heaven and earth
      this type of revolution has never been seen before. It win be
      astonishing and terrible.<br>
      <br>
      The destruction will be such that people will die as they work,
      sleep or stand. People will be killed by gas; buildings will
      remain but the danger is to humanity. Babaji reminds us to be
      prepared.<br>
      <br>
      <b>22 MARCH 1983 </b><br>
      <br>
      Every day you hear something and today I will repeat what I have
      said before. A great Revolution is coming. Wherever you live, be
      prepared to face-the Revolution. Whatever occupation you might
      have, take part in the Revolution. Whether one works in the police
      department or in the military, everyone will take part. <br>
      <br>
      Everyone must spread the message of Babaji, wherever he lives.
      Only that person can take part that is prepared to face death,
      which is prepared to die at any moment. Only the man who is daring
      and has courage, who is prepared to die for the sake of
      righteousness, is fit to face the Revolution.<br>
      <br>
      The whole universe will be involved in this Mahakranti (Great
      Revolution). It is not limited to India. I am warning everyone in
      the universe. In whatever area one may live, he must spread this
      message. To whatever profession a person may belong, whatever may
      be his activity, he must take part in this Revolution. This will
      be the greatest Revolution in the history of the world-so all of
      you must be alert and make others alert.<br>
      <br>
      Awake! Arise! Everybody must make a firm resolve. Men and women
      from all over the world must take part. In other Yugas, only men
      took part in revolutions and wars but now women are coming
      forward, so it is necessary for them, too, to take part in this
      Revolution. Everybody must make contacts on all sides of the world
      and unite together.<br>
      <br>
      <b>&nbsp;7 APRIL 1983</b><br>
      <br>
      In the world today fire is bursting out on one side, while nectar
      flows on the other. You must decide if you choose fire or nectar.
      While flames of the fire are spreading, it is up to us to save
      others and ourselves. <br>
      <br>
      We must be alert. At this moment, people are jumping into the fire
      because of their ignorance. We must save these people, and we can
      do so only if we have great courage.<br>
      We should give this courage to others as nothing can be done
      without it. Courage is the most important thing. Shri Mahaprabhuji
      has told you many times to wake up. Wake up yourselves and '
      others. Control your mind and have firm determination.<br>
      <br>
      Whoever comes here must vow to save him and the world. Wherever
      you go, be prepared to save people. Be firm like a rock, deep and
      serious like the sea.<br>
      <br>
      Think of the earth as a mother. This is one earth. Don't be
      divided by thinking of yourselves as belonging to different
      countries. We belong to one earth. Proceed with this in mind. Look
      to the future with a vision of good deeds for the whole world, not
      just one county., Have great courage and patience-and be not
      afraid of water, fire or great storms – face them bravely.<br>
      <br>
      Shri Mahaprabhuji reveals the truth of a mystery to you-the
      Revolution will occur simultaneously everywhere in the world.
      Countries, which believe that they can save themselves through the
      newly invented weapons, can forget this thought, for they will not
      be able to do so. Everyone knows of the present day events taking
      place in lran. No one had ever heard of the name of Khomeini
      before and suddenly he captured everything he wanted.<br>
      <br>
      Shri Mahaprabhuji is preparing for the Great Revolution. When and
      where it will start is not to be disclosed now. When the time
      comes you all will know. In the Treta Yuga, the revolution
      (Kranti) started from Lanka and until it happened, no one, not
      even Rama, knew that it would start from there. In the Dvapara
      Yuga, at the time of Lord Krishna, no one knew where the
      revolution would start. When it began at Kurukshetra, people from
      all over the world collected there for the beginning of a world
      war. <br>
      <br>
      Mahaprabhuji will show his lila to the world in the same way. As
      you know, the flames of revolution are presently spreading in the
      world.There is no power, which can stop the fire and reduce the
      heat. Super powers like Russia and America will not be able to
      face the fire even with their new weapons. Nothing that they have
      invented will be of any use. Everything can be destroyed. All must
      be prepared for this revolution - especially those who are here.<br>
      <br>
      Whether old or young, private or public, those working or not -
      all must take part. It is devotion, love and yoga for you to save
      the world and join in the revolution. For those who are true
      devotees of Babaji, the flames of fire will become cool. Face the
      fire and it will turn to ice. This requires control of mind and a
      firm determination. Everyone must consider himself a soldier and
      be active. Everyone will have to face the fire.<br>
      <br>
      <b>23 NOVEMBER 1983&nbsp; </b><br>
      <br>
      At present, not only humanity is in danger, but all sentient and
      insentient beings of the universe are in danger. I have not only
      to consider human beings but I have to save the entire Creation.
      How is this possible? (A long pause). It is quite impossible.<br>
      <br>
      The calamities, which are coining to this world, are unavoidable.
      Only he who has strong determination to do good acts and who is
      strongly devoted to God can survive this destruction.<br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      <b>17 DECEMBER 1983 </b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      A great Revolution is going to take place such as has never before
      occurred in the world. <br>
      <br>
      The, hearts of the people who read or hear the history of this
      Revolution will melt.<br>
      <br>
      This is an era of great destruction-no other time can be compared
      to this. The Revolution will last not for minutes but only for
      some seconds. <br>
      <br>
      The countries, which have invented these destructive weapons, will
      themselves be destroyed. They should not think they are secure. <br>
      <br>
      Only he who has surrendered completely at the feet of Shri
      Mahaprabhuji (God) is secure.<br>

            Nutrient Ever Discovered for Eye Health</b></big><br>
        <br>

      <big><br>
        Scientists long ago discovered that a class of
        naturally-occurring pigments called carotenoids held powerful
        antioxidant properties that are crucial for your health. But
        only recently has one particular carotenoid jumped to the
        forefront in terms of its status as a "super nutrient," becoming
        the focus of a large and growing number of peer-reviewed
        scientific publications.<br>
        <br>
        This carotenoid is called astaxanthin. Astaxanthin is produced
        by the microalgae Haematococcus pluvialis when its water supply
        dries up, forcing it to protect itself from ultraviolet
        radiation.<br>
        <br>
        Astaxanthin is leaps and bounds more powerful than
        beta-carotene, alpha-tocopherol, lycopene, and lutein--other
        members of its chemical family. Astaxanthin exhibits VERY STRONG
        free radical scavenging activity, and protects your cells,
        organs, and body tissues from oxidative damage.<br>
        <br>
        What makes astaxanthin so different from other nutritional
        elements? And what can it do for your health? The answers to
        these questions will form the basis of the remainder of this
        article, and I think you'll be quite impressed.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Astaxanthin Is in a League of Its Own</b><br>
        <br>
        There are many properties that make this carotenoid special.
        Here are the main differences:<br>
        <br>
        Astaxanthin is by far the most powerful carotenoid antioxidant
        when it comes to free radical scavenging: it is 65 times more
        powerful than vitamin C, 54 times more powerful than
        beta-carotene, and 14 times more powerful than vitamin E.<br>
        <br>
        Astaxanthin is far more effective than other carotenoids at
        "singlet oxygen quenching," which is a particular type of
        oxidation. The damaging effects of sunlight and various organic
        materials are caused by this less-stable form of oxygen.
        Astaxanthin is 550 times more powerful than vitamin E and 11
        times more powerful than beta-carotene at neutralizing this
        singlet oxygen.<br>
        <br>
        Astaxanthin crosses the blood-brain barrier AND the
        blood-retinal barrier (beta-carotene and lycopene do not), which
        has huge implications for the health of your eyes.<br>
        It is soluble in lipids, so it incorporates into cell membranes.<br>
        It is a potent UVB absorber.<br>
        It reduces DNA damage.<br>
        It is a very powerful natural anti-inflammatory.<br>
        No adverse reactions have been found for people taking
        astaxanthin.<br>
        It is virtually impossible to obtain the recommended daily
        amount of astaxanthin from diet alone because there are only two
        prime sources: microalgae and sea creatures that consume the
        algae (such as salmon, shellfish, and krill).<br>
        <br>
        Astaxanthin is the most commonly-occurring, red carotenoid in
        marine and aquatic animals, especially salmon, giving it its
        characteristic pink color. Salmon and other sea creatures, like
        other animals, cannot synthesize astaxanthin themselves and must
        obtain it from their diets, which include zooplankton and krill.
        These smaller organisms feed on the microalgae, which are the
        original producers of the pigment.<br>
        <br>
        Laboratory-made astaxanthin is now commonly used worldwide to
        supplement fish feeds in order to obtain the desired pinkish to
        orange-red color. However, wild salmon are 400 percent higher in
        astaxanthin than farmed salmon, and 100 percent of theirs is
        natural astaxanthin, rather than synthetic.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Astaxanthin's Long List of Health Benefits Is Growing by the
          Day</b><br>
        <br>
        There may be no other single natural substance that performs so
        many beneficial biochemical functions as this little-known
        carotenoid. Its scope is truly amazing. Here are just some of
        the ways astaxanthin can positively impact your health,
        according to the latest research:<br>
        <br>
        Supporting immune function<br>
        Improving cardiovascular health by reducing C-Reactive Proteins
        (CRP), reducing triglycerides, and increasing beneficial HDL<br>
        GREATLY protecting your eyes from cataracts, macular
        degeneration, and blindness (which I will discuss at length
        below)<br>
        Protecting your brain from dementia and Alzheimer's<br>
        Reducing your risk for many types of cancer (including cancers
        of the breast, colon, bladder, and mouth) by stimulating
        apoptosis (cancer cell death) and inhibiting lipid peroxidation<br>
        Improving recovery from spinal cord and other central nervous
        system injuries<br>
        Reducing inflammation from all causes, including arthritis and
        asthma<br>
        Improving endurance, workout performance, and recovery<br>
        Helping to stabilize blood sugar, thereby protecting your
        kidneys<br>
        Relieving indigestion and reflux<br>
        Improving fertility by increasing sperm strength and sperm count<br>
        <br>
        Actually helping to prevent sunburn, and protecting you from the
        damaging effects of radiation (i.e., flying in airplanes,
        x-rays, CT scans, etc.)...<br>
        <br>
        <b>Carotenoids and Your Eyes</b><br>
        <br>
        When you were a child, odds are you were told, "Eat carrots --
        they'll give you good eyesight!" There is some truth to that old
        adage, as carrots contain carotenoids -- many of which are
        important for your eyes. Vitamin A, or retinal, is vital to your
        retina -- without it, you would simply go blind. But vitamin A
        is readily available from your diet.<br>
        <br>
        Of all the carotenoids, only zeaxanthin and lutein are found in
        your retina, which has the highest concentration of fatty acids
        of any tissue in your body. This is because your retina is a
        highly light and oxygen rich environment, and it needs a large
        force of free radical scavengers to prevent oxidative damage
        there.<br>
        <br>
        It is theorized that your body concentrates zeaxanthin and
        lutein in your retina to perform this duty. The concentration of
        these two pigments in the macula of your retina is what gives it
        its characteristic yellow color. (The macula is actually called
        the "macula lutea" which literally means "yellow spot.")
        Zeaxanthin and lutein both cross the blood-brain-retina
        barriers, as astaxanthin does.<br>
        <br>
        It is interesting that your eye preferentially concentrates
        zeaxanthin over lutein in the central macular retinal area
        (called the fovea), where the greatest amount of light impinges
        -- and zeaxanthin is a more effective singlet oxygen scavenger
        than lutein. Your body seems to naturally "know" this and
        accumulates it where it's most needed!<br>
        <br>
        Leading Causes of Blindness: Macular Degeneration and Cataracts<br>
        <br>
        Science is now revealing that astaxanthin may be the ULTIMATE
        carotenoid for eye health and prevention of blindness. Blindness
        is an enormous problem worldwide. These statistics1 might
        disturb you:<br>
        <br>
        Age-related macular degeneration (ARMD) is the leading cause of
        blindness for people over the age of 50.<br>
        <br>
        Sixty million people suffer from ARMD worldwide, and 10 million
        are blind.<br>
        <br>
        Severe, irreversible vision loss affects 30 percent of people
        over the age of 55.<br>
        <br>
        Cataracts are another major cause of blindness, affecting more
        than 20 million people in the U.S. alone. Cataracts are caused
        by lipid peroxidation of the epithelial layer of the lens.
        Although they can have other causes, most are related to aging.<br>
        <br>
        Cataracts result in 3 million cataract surgeries every year.<br>
        <br>
        Clinical studies tell us that photic injury from the cumulative
        effect of repeated "photic insults" and the resulting gradual
        loss of photoreceptor cells is a major cause of ARMD. Therefore,
        anything you can do to cut your losses from these photic insults
        will reduce your risk for developing macular degeneration as you
        age.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Protecting Your Retina with Astaxanthin</b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        Vitamin C can help protect you from retinal injury from
        excessive light energy, and indeed, high levels of vitamin C are
        found in human retinal tissues. But this common nutrient cannot
        do the job alone.<br>
        <br>
        Epidemiological studies have shown that diets high in
        carotenoids (especially lutein and zeaxanthin) are associated
        with a reduced risk of cataracts and ARMD. It has also been
        shown experimentally that regular consumption of lutein
        supplements can increase your macular pigment density, which may
        potentially reduce your risk for later development of ARMD.<br>
        <br>
        Scientists have studied lutein, zeaxanthin, canthaxanthin, and
        astaxanthin for their respective abilities to protect the
        retina. But none functions to the degree that astaxanthin does,2
        in terms of potency as a free radical scavenger and/or
        permeability across your blood-brain-retina barrier.<br>
        <br>
        In studies, canthaxanthin was actually found to be potentially
        damaging to the eye as it caused eye inclusions, which can lead
        to retinopathy. So this carotenoid was ruled out as a
        supplement.<br>
        <br>
        Dr. Mark Tso of the Wilmer Eye Institute at Johns Hopkins
        University (considered by most professionals to be the most
        prestigious ophthalmology training center in the world) has
        clearly demonstrated that astaxanthin is the clear winner when
        it comes to protecting your eyes.<br>
        <br>
        He discovered that astaxanthin easily crosses into the tissues
        of the eye and exerts its effects safely and with more potency
        than any of the other carotenoids, without adverse reactions.
        Specifically, Tso determined astaxanthin could ameliorate or
        prevent light induced damage, photoreceptor cell damage,
        ganglion cell damage, and damage to the neurons of the inner
        retinal layers. He concluded that astaxanthin supplementation
        could be effective in preventing or treating a whole host of eye
        diseases, including:<br>
        <br>
        Age-related macular degeneration (ARMD)<br>
        Diabetic neuropathy<br>
        Cystoid macular edema<br>
        Central retinal arterial and venous occlusion<br>
        Glaucoma<br>
        Inflammatory eye diseases (i.e., retinitis, iritis, keratitis,
        scleritis, etc.)<br>
        <br>
        Other researchers (Shimidzu et al, Bagchi, Martin et al,4 and
        Beutner5) have since confirmed Dr. Tso's finding that
        astaxanthin is the most powerful antioxidant ever discovered for
        eye health, giving your eyes an additional layer of long-term
        protection...<br>

      <div align="center"><big><b>Sweet discovery in leafy greens holds
            key to gut health</b></big><br>
      </div>
      <big><br>
        A critical discovery about how bacteria feed on an unusual sugar
        molecule found in leafy green vegetables could hold the key to
        explaining how 'good' bacteria protect our gut and promote
        health.<br>
        <br>
        The finding suggests that leafy greens are essential for feeding
        good gut bacteria, limiting the ability of bad bacteria to
        colonise the gut by shutting them out of the prime 'real
        estate'.<br>
        <br>
        Researchers from Melbourne and the UK identified a previously
        unknown enzyme used by bacteria, fungi and other organisms to
        feed on the unusual but abundant sugar sulfoquinovose - SQ for
        short - found in green vegetables.<br>
        <br>
        Each year, leafy green vegetables - such as spinach - produce
        the sugar on an enormous scale globally, comparable to the
        world's total annual iron ore production.<br>
        <br>
        The research, published today in the journal Nature Chemical
        Biology, was led by Dr Ethan Goddard-Borger from the Walter and
        Eliza Hall Institute, Professor Spencer Williams from the Bio21
        Institute and University of Melbourne, and Professor Gideon
        Davies from the University of York, UK.<br>
        <br>
        Dr Goddard-Borger said the discovery could be exploited to
        cultivate the growth of 'good' gut bacteria. "Every time we eat
        leafy green vegetables we consume significant amounts of SQ
        sugars, which are used as an energy source by good gut
        bacteria," he said.<br>
        <br>
        "Bacteria in the gut, such as crucial protective strains of E.
        coli, use SQ as a source of energy. E. coli provides a
        protective barrier that prevents growth and colonisation by bad
        bacteria, because the good bugs are taking up all the habitable
        real estate," Dr Goddard-Borger said.<br>
        <br>
        "E. coli is a key bacterial coloniser needed by our gut. We
        speculate that consumption of this specific molecule within
        leafy greens will prove to be an important factor in improving
        and maintaining healthy gut bacteria and good digestive health."<br>
        <br>
        Professor Williams said the team had revealed how bacteria
        extract the sugar from plants in order to fuel their growth. "We
        discovered the enzyme YihQ, which is used by bacteria to absorb
        and metabolise these sulfur-containing sugars as food," he said.<br>
        <br>
        "Sulfur is critical for building proteins, the essential
        components of all living organisms. SQ is the only sugar
        molecule which contains sulfur, and 'digestion' of the molecule
        by bacteria releases sulfur into the environment, where it
        re-enters the global 'sulfur cycle' to be reused by other
        organisms."<br>
        <br>
        Professor Williams said that the pathway was unusual, but
        abundant in biological organisms.<br>
        <br>
        "This work answers a 50-year mystery that has surrounded how
        sulfur - an element essential for life on Earth - was used and
        recycled by living organisms," he said. "What is remarkable is
        that the YihQ enzyme was hiding in plain sight and is produced
        by the humble bacterium E. coli, present in nearly every
        biologist's laboratory."<br>
        <br>
        The discovery also provides crucial insights that may one day be
        exploited to develop an entirely new class of antibiotics, Dr
        Goddard-Borger said. "New antimicrobial strategies are
        desperately needed as more and more bacteria acquire resistance
        to existing classes of antibiotics."<br>
        <br>
        "We think it will be possible to use these widespread enzymes to
        enable highly specific delivery of antibiotics to harmful forms
        of E. coli and other pathogens, such as Salmonella, responsible
        for food poisoning, while leaving the good gut bacteria
        untouched."<br>

        Sulfoquinovose is produced by photosynthetic organisms at a rate
        of 1010 tons per annum and is degraded by bacteria as a source
        of carbon and sulfur. We have identified Escherichia coli YihQ
        as the first dedicated sulfoquinovosidase and the gateway enzyme
        to sulfoglycolytic pathways. Structural and mutagenesis studies
        unveiled the sequence signatures for binding the distinguishing

        <br>
        Contemporary neuroscience suggests the existence of fundamental
        algorithms by which all sensory transduction is translated into
        an intrinsic, brain-specific code. Direct stimulation of these
        codes within the human temporal or limbic cortices by applied
        electromagnetic patterns may require energy levels which are
        within the range of both geomagnetic activity and contemporary
        communication networks. A process which is coupled to the narrow
        band of brain temperature could allow all normal human brains to
        be affected by a subharmonic whose frequency range at about 10
        Hz would only vary by 0.1 Hz.<br>

      <div align="center"><big><b>Chaos Algorithm</b></big><br>
      </div>
      <big><br>
        This algorithm uses a population growth model developed by
        biologist Robert May in 1976. The model represents a logistic
        difference equation used by ecologists for calculating
        demographics of populations over time. The model is a
        modification of the Malthusian scenerio of unrestrained growth
        (x next = rx) a linear growth function developed by Thomas
        Malthus in Essay on the Principle of Population (1798). The
        growth model is an expression of how populations increase
        geometrically to the power x (e.g. 1,3,9,27,81...) while food
        supplies increase at an arithmetic rate ( e.g. 0, 10, 20, 30 40
        ...). When left unchecked, populations will catastrophically
        outpace food supplies. Ecologists added an extra term x next =
        rx(1-x) to reflect the realities of population dynamics and
        survival rates. X is a number between 0 and 1 representing a
        population at a given time. r is a positive number representing
        the rate of reproduction and starvation combined.<br>
        <br>
        Please note that the return values from the chaos algorithm are
        represented by numbers with several decimal places. In order to
        normalize these values the algorithm must use integers;
        therefore, the algorithm uses a multiplier to adjust the
        results.<br>
        <br>
        Users can anticipate the return values from the following
        information:<br>
        <br>
        When r is between 0 and 1 the population will die off, because
        the rate of reproduction is not high enough to sustain a
        population.<br>
        <br>
        When r is between 1 and 2 the population will increase and
        quickly stabilize to a steady state.<br>
        <br>
        When r is between 2 and 3 the population will take longer to
        increase and stabilize to a steady state than values between 1
        and 2.<br>
        <br>
        When r is between 3 and 3.45 the population values will increase
        and bifurcate. The population size alternate between two values
        forever. This phenomenon is called "period 2."<br>
        <br>
        When r is between 3.45 and 3.54 the population values will
        increase until it reaches period 4, a continuos repetition of
        four values.<br>
        <br>
        When r is between 3.54 and 3.56 the values will reach several
        different states: period 8, period 16, period 32 etc...
        depending on the exact value of r.<br>
        <br>
        When r is equal to or greater than 3.57 the population values
        will demonstrate chaotic behavior.<br>

        </b><b>Abstract</b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        Magnetic applications have been used to treat painful stimuli in
        various contexts. Magnetic fields that mimic
        electrophysiological patterns have been referred to as complex
        magnetic fields. In 7 different experiments, the optimal
        parameters for producing a robust analgesia (equivalent to about
        4 mg/kg of morphine) in male rats to thermal stimuli following
        exposures to weak (1 microTesla (μT)) complex magnetic fields
        were explored. Thermal nociceptive thresholds for male Wistar
        rats were examined after exposure to the experimental treatment.
        Two different complex magnetic patterns were investigated for
        their potential analgesic effects. Rats were exposed (whole
        body) to a magnetic field treatment for a pre-defined duration
        usually lasting 30 min unless otherwise specified. The
        parameters evaluated for eliciting analgesia included the
        optimal time delay between successive presentations of the
        magnetic field, total length of magnetic field exposure, and the
        duration the specific values that generated the total pattern
        were activated. Maximum analgesia occurred when patterns of
        magnetic fields with burst-firing-like configurations lasting
        690 msec were presented once every approximately 4 sec for 30
        min rather than 60 min. Rats with histories of epilepsy and
        brain damage showed maintained elevation of nociceptive
        thresholds for at least one week after a single exposure to
        these magnetic fields. A different frequency-modulated pattern
        also produced an analgesic response that lasted for 4 h
        following an exposure of 30 min but not 2 h. A constantly
        generated pattern derived from a chaos (May algorithm) function
        produced similar levels of analgesia. The results of these
        experiments suggest that rational designs of the temporal
        structures of weak magnetic fields may be a novel, inexpensive,
        and, reliable technique for producing analgesia to some classes
        of painful stimuli.<br>

      <big><b> Summary</b><br>
        <br>
        Contemporary neuroscience suggests the existence of fundamental
        algorithms by which all sensory transduction is translated into
        the intrinsic, brain-specific code. Direct stimulation of these
        codes within the human temporal or limbic cortices by applied
        electromagnetic patterns may require energy levels which are
        within the range of both geomagnetic activity and contemporary
        communication networks. A process which is coupled to the narrow
        band of brain temperature could allow all normal human brains to
        be affected by a subharmonic whose frequency range at about 10
        Hz would only vary by 0.1 Hz.  The pursuit of the basic
        algorithms by which all human brains operate can be considered a
        central theme of modern neuroscience. Although individual
        differences are expected to accommodate most of the variance in
        any specific neurobehavioral measure, there should exist basic
        patterns of information and structure within brain space. They
        would be determined by the human genome, i.e., be
        species-specific, and would contribute to or would serve as the
        substrate upon which all phenomena that affect neurobehavioral
        measures are superimposed…<br>

        A revolutionary treatment that could stop cancer from ever
        coming back is close to becoming widely available, scientists
        said yesterday.<br>
        <br>
        Dubbed a ‘living drug’, it will act in a similar way to a
        vaccine, by being constantly alert for the disease returning.<br>
        <br>
        T-cell immunotherapy hit headlines last year when British baby
        Layla Richards became one of the first people in the world to be
        given the treatment, which is made from the body’s own cells.<br>
        <br>
        Now, two landmark studies have revealed the therapy’s stunning
        potential. <br>
        <br>
        One suggests it will last for at least 14 years in the body,
        raising the tantalising prospect of a permanent cure for cancer.
        <br>
        <br>
        In the other, 94 per cent of terminally ill patients saw the
        disease vanish completely. <br>
        <br>
        The ‘extraordinary’ results – seen in so-called ‘liquid’ cancers
        such as leukaemia rather than those that form solid tumours –
        are ‘unprecedented in medicine’, the world’s biggest science
        conference heard.<br>
        <br>
        Researcher Chiara Bonini said: ‘This really is a revolution.’<br>
        <br>
        The treatment is created from T-cells – white blood cells that
        normally fight off viruses and bacteria – which are removed from
        the patient and genetically tweaked to recognise and attack
        their cancer.<br>
        <br>
        The genetically-modified cells are then grown in their millions
        in a lab before being infused back into the patient, where they
        hunt down and destroy the cancer cells. <br>
        <br>
        Scientists around the world are perfecting the technique, and a
        series of trials have shown it to have remarkable potential.<br>
        <br>
        Some of the most exciting results come from the San Raffaele
        Scientific Institute in Milan, where doctors gave ten patients
        infusions of T-cells and watched how long they lasted in the
        body. <br>
        <br>
        One type of T-cell survived for 14 years, the conference of the
        American Association for the Advancement of Science heard.<br>
        <br>
        Dr Bonini said these cells may last for life. If they were also
        genetically engineered to hunt out and destroy cancer, they
        would patrol the body year after year and stop it from ever
        returning.<br>
        <br>
        She likened the therapy to a vaccine that gives protection for
        life against an infection, adding: ‘T-cells are a living drug
        and they have the potential to persist in our body for our whole
        lives. <br>
        <br>
        'Our findings have profound implications for the design of
        T-cell-based immunotherapies.’ <br>
        <br>
        Dr Bonini said patients were ‘very close’ to the first
        treatments becoming widely available.' <br>
        <br>
        Professor Daniel Davis, a Manchester University expert on the
        immune system, described the study as ‘an important advance’.<br>
        <br>
        He said: ‘The implication is that infusing genetically-modified
        versions of these particular T-cells could provide a
        long-lasting immune response. Immunotherapy has great potential
        to revolutionise cancer treatments and this study shows which
        type of T-cells might be especially useful to manipulate.’<br>
        <br>
        A second study, also presented at the conference in Washington
        DC, reinforced the potential of T-cell immunotherapy.<br>
        <br>
        When scientists at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Centre in
        Seattle gave genetically-modified T-cells to leukaemia patients
        with months to live, the cancer disappeared in 94 per cent of
        cases. Patients with other blood cancers saw response rates of
        greater than 80 per cent, with more than half experiencing
        complete remission.<br>
        <br>
        Researcher Dr Stanley Riddell said: ‘These are patients that
        have failed [every other treatment].<br>
        <br>
        ‘Most patients in our trial would be projected to have two to
        five months to live. <br>
        <br>
        'This is extraordinary... unprecedented in medicine to get
        response rates in this range in these very advanced patients.<br>
        <br>
        ‘We have a long way to go. The response is not always durable,
        some of these patients do relapse … but the early data is
        unprecedented.’<br>
        <br>
        Professor Dirk Busch, a T-cell researcher at the Technical
        University of Munich, said: ‘We have now for the first time
        genetically engineered T-cells in patients.<br>
        <br>
        ‘A couple of years ago, nobody would have expected that they
        would work so nicely, that they would survive so nicely. That
        opens the door for getting more creative and making better
        cells.’<br>
        <br>
        The treatment is not without its challenges, including
        side-effects that can be severe and even fatal. Success so far
        has been in leukaemia and other ‘liquid’ cancers, rather than
        prostate, breast and other tumours that form lumps.<br>
        <br>
        Getting T-cells deep inside solid tumours will be difficult.
        Cost is also an issue, as the treatment is tailored to
        individual patients.<br>
        <br>
        Cancer Research UK’s Dr Kat Arney said it was an ‘exciting
        prospect’. <br>
        <br>
        She stressed that it ‘doesn’t yet work for all patients … we
        still need more results from more trials … but there’s a lot of
        hope this type of therapy could save lives’.<br>
        <br>
        ‘Like a vaccine that protects for life.’<br>

        …It only takes a small search to find that most of the Stan
        Meyer research online is obsessed with his VIC (voltage
        intensifier circuits) and resonance in order to create
        abnormally high amounts of commonly ducted water gas (HHO). The
        problem is, this has absolutely nothing to do with what Stan
        Meyer was originally doing. None of the high voltage water
        splitting methods were around until much later in his research
        and its an indisputable fact documented by his own patents and
        other paperwork…<br>
        <br>
        As the video says, Meyer didn’t really claim to condition his
        tubes, but he did post that he was wanting to insulate them with
        Delrin and other methods to prevent current. In any case, I did
        find that I was able to get a lot of gas production from a
        little input but this isn’t even the main point to this post.<br>
        <br>
        Many people tried this but it wasn’t until Ravi, a brilliant
        engineer who started to post his replications of my work that
        people took notice. Many people&nbsp; tried to rewrite history
        about who did what and you can see what Ravi has to say about it
        himself here:<br>

        Now, in Energetic Forum, Michael J.N. and Tutanka were
        mentioning the importance of nitrogen and I was completely open
        to learning what they wanted to share. Michael had built a jet
        engine that runs on water about 25-30 years ago at this point
        during at time that Stan Meyer was traveling to the UK. He knew
        Stan Meyer and Stan admitted to him that his exhaust smelled
        like ammonia. I have personally met a good handful of people
        that personally worked and met with Meyer and they all concur
        that Meyer’s exhaust did indeed smell like ammonia and nitrogen
        was indeed important to the process of creating a synthetic gas
        on demand...<br>
        <br>
        Here is my replication of the jet engine system and I didn’t
        even get to modifying any of the steam to turn it into syngas
        yet at the time, but you can see that I was able to bring the
        propane down to 0 psi on the gauge. The gauge is too big to see
        how much so it is still running on propane but just traces. I
        started out with 8 psi before the mods and again, I got that far
        without even modifying the water vapor, yet…<br>
        <br>
        Meyer did mention that he used “non-combustible gas” to slow
        down the burn rate of the hydrogen gas in his process so that he
        can get it to burn more like gasoline. If you have experimented
        with hydrogen gas, you know it detonates and does not combust so
        you cannot get the real thermal energy out of it. The Meyer
        “experts” spreading disinformation online will tell you that
        nitrogen is not the non-combustible gas, especially (E.M.) – he
        expressed violent opposition to it as evidenced by all his posts
        in Energetic Forum including threatening my life as I mentioned.<br>
        <br>
        I already knew about the non-combustible gas reference and it
        was a member named “Rock” who brought it to my attention that
        Nitrogen was actually spelled out in Meyer’s earlier work so it
        wasn’t speculation. You can see in Meyer’s earlier work he
        spelled out Nitrogen and later in his work, he removed the word
        Nitrogen and only referred to it as a non-combustible gas.<br>
        <br>
        Many people applaud hydrogen cars for having water as an
        exhaust, but that is only showing you evidence that they
        destroyed almost all of the thermal energy they could have
        received from the hydrogen had they PREVENTED the formation of
        the water molecule. That is the key to the Stan Meyer
        technology.<br>
        <br>
        Let’s look at what Meyer’s patent say:<br>
        At this link: <br>
        <br>
        <a href="http://www.google.com/patents/CA1235669A1"
          "><b>http://www.google.com/patents/CA1235669A1 </b></a><br>
        <br>
        you can see it clearly states, “The flame 25 is sustained in
        that the NITROGEN gases 16 a xxx n REDUCES THE VELOCITY AND
        TEMPERATURE OF THE HYDROGEN GAS 14 a xxx n.”<br>
        <br>
        When you dilute the water gas with nitrogen, the ignited
        hydrogen will bind to nitrogen and create NH3 (ammonia) and that
        prevents the formation of the water molecule. It also allows the
        hydrogen to burn slower so that it is more like a slower
        gasoline combustion instead of a fast hydrogen detonation…<br>

        Jeff Masters, the climate guru at Weather Underground, has come
        up with “The Top Ten Reasons to be Hopeful on Climate Change.”
        Actually, Masters is merely quoting from his favorite
        presentation at the annual meeting of the American Geophysical
        Union on 16 December 2015, as delivered by Susan Hassol of
        climatecommunication.org. As implied by the title of this essay,
        I disagree with Hassol and Masters, and I’ll take this
        opportunity to point out why.<br>
        <br>
        At the meeting, Hassol presented her top ten list of reasons to
        be hopeful about climate change. Her list is presented below in
        italics, and my response follows in plain font.<br>
        <br>
        10) President Obama has put climate change at the top of his
        agenda.<br>
        <br>
        I’ve no doubt President Obama has put climate change near the
        top of his agenda, not far below maintaining this set of living
        arrangements. The latter, of course, involves promoting omnicide
        by converting the living planet into “resources,” killing many
        people throughout the world for “our” fossil fuels, and quashing
        every counter-cultural act in this country and beyond. The
        typical American has no idea these actions are occurring,
        because the typical American is willfully ignorant about them.
        Were the typical American informed of these actions, s/he would
        deny them. If the typical American were willing to be convinced
        by overwhelming evidence — an oxymoron so evident it’s tragic —
        s/he would find the actions not only necessary, but desirable.
        “American exceptionalism” has its price.<br>
        <br>
        Considering climate change is merely one symptom among many
        resulting from this set of living arrangements, I believe
        President Obama will pay little heed to climate change. And I
        doubt he ever mentions the topic of abrupt climate change in
        public, a topic about which he is undoubtedly familiar.<br>
        <br>
        9) The Pope has framed climate change as a moral issue.<br>
        <br>
        Well, that’ll fix it. One of the world’s leading voices for
        patriarchal immorality has spoken. Please let me know when the
        Pope redistributes the Vatican’s enormous wealth to benefit the
        world’s poor. Let me know when the Church he heads recognizes
        equal rights for women and ethnic minorities. Let me know when
        he takes a moral stand on industrial civilization, which
        underlies the climate-change predicament in which we are
        embroiled.<br>
        <br>
        8) China has become highly motivated and engaged, and naysayers
        can no longer claim that we shouldn’t do anything because China
        is not.<br>
        <br>
        China’s motivation and engagement has led to no substantive
        positive outcomes. Plenty of fans were motivated and engaged by
        the Super Bowl, and their chosen team still didn’t win.
        Furthermore, whether “we” should or should not do anything is
        irrelevant and certainly is not influenced by China’s motivation
        and engagement. I’ll be interested when Chinese leaders tell the
        citizenry that collapse of industrial civilization is not only
        necessary, but desirable. And I’ll be especially interested when
        politicians in the United States follow China’s lead on this
        topic.<br>
        <br>
        7) Emissions and the economy are decoupling: for the first time,
        we had a year where the economy grew, but emissions of
        greenhouse gases did not.<br>
        <br>
        The economy grew only on computer screens housed deep in the
        vaults of the world’s central banks and governments. Emissions
        fell because the world has fallen into the Great Depression 2.0.
        Actual economic growth is closely tied to emissions of
        greenhouse gases. Still.<br>
        <br>
        6) The cost of solar power is falling fast.<br>
        <br>
        Civilization is a heat engine. Promoting the “new economy”
        maintains the heat engine as well as the omnicide attendant to
        civilization.<br>
        <br>
        5) Solar energy capacity is growing rapidly.<br>
        <br>
        Ditto. And electricity represents less than 20% of energy usage.<br>
        <br>
        4) Wind energy capacity is growing rapidly.<br>
        <br>
        Any port in a shitstorm, eh? See above.<br>
        <br>
        3) Half of all new power resources coming on-line globally are
        in renewable energy, and that percentage is near 70% in the U.S.<br>
        <br>
        As Vladimir Lenin allegedly said (or perhaps it was Joseph
        Goebbels), “A lie told often enough becomes the truth.”<br>
        <br>
        “Renewable” energy is derived from fossil fuels. These
        derivatives require and promote planetary destruction. All this
        was old news when I wrote about it during early November 2013.
        Apparently well-paid, starry-eyed climate scientists are not
        expected to keep up with evidence.<br>
        <br>
        2) Businesses are engaging in promoting climate change action.<br>
        <br>
        Follow the money all the way to the “new economy,” mentioned
        above.<br>
        <br>
        1) The Paris Accord! The nations of the world have now dedicated
        themselves to decarbonizing the world economy.<br>
        <br>
        Climate science James Hansen called the Paris Accord a “fraud”
        and “bullshit.” Mr. Optimist himself, Bill McKibben, correctly
        concluded the agreement reached in Paris will leave us with a
        planet that is “uninhabitable.”<br>
        <br>
        Apparently well-paid, starry-eyed climate scientists are not
        expected to keep up with evidence. But I repeat myself.<br>
        <br>
        Dismantling ignorance and stupidity within a culture that
        promotes both is an unending task. And, obviously, there is
        nothing to be gained by using evidence along the path to truth.
        Some of us will never learn.<br>

        The exhibit displays summaries, sometimes with images, of 43
        clean electricity generators, 18 advanced self-powered electric
        vehicle innovations, 26 radioactivity neutralization methods, 23
        space travel innovations, 10 technical solutions to water
        shortages, and my own design of a torsion field school network.
        It also displays 25 movie posters and 62 Hubble Space Telescope
        images.<br>
        <br>
        Hopefully the Gallery of Clean Energy Inventions and Student Art
        Contest will inspire some young people to become world-class
        inventors, engineers and scientists.<br>

            Anarcapulco for Refusing Body Scanner at LAX </b></big><br>
      </div>
      <big><br>
        Statement of Ken O'Keefe - I am not surprised that the Orwellian
        TSA (Homeland Security) have denied me the ability to board a
        flight from LAX to Acapulco because I opted out of the body
        scanner procedure. I refused this as an ex-US Marine who has
        been given experimental injections and pills during the 1st Gulf
        War (along with 600,000 other American sons and daughters),
        these experimental drugs being administered without informed
        consent due to a “waiver’ provided by the Food &amp; Drug
        Administration (FDA) of the US Government. Many have died from
        ‘Gulf War Syndrome’ due to these experimental drugs, essentially
        many have been murdered by the FDA and US Military who ordered
        American sons and daughters to take experimental drugs. I have
        in the past always opted out of the body scanner and agreed
        (under duress) to a physical body search, today I once again
        agreed to this under duress but again was told I MUST SUBMIT TO
        A BODY SCAN OR BE DENIED THE ABILITY TO TRAVEL/FLY. I have
        refused these terms, which inherently mean radiating myself with
        their dangerous body scanners.<br>
        <br>
        The “officials” responsible for this denial of rights are:<br>
        1) Brandon Brown - TSA Manager LAX - phone 310-258-4848<br>
        2) Tamara Thomas, Deputy Assistant to the Federal Security
        Director - Tamara insisted that I must submit to a body scan -
        it is said that this is due to me being listed by TSA as a
        'security threat' and my boarding passes always having the code
        ‘SSSS’.<br>
        <br>
        Fuck the traitors in all areas of American society. The US
        Constitution is the only answer for Americans.<br>
        TJP,<br>
        Ken O"Keefe<br>
        <br>
        I am literally trapped in the USA unless I can exit the country
        without a body scan, i do not even know how to do this.<br>
        <br>
        I request meaningful help to secure my right to fly without a
        body scan.<br>
        <br>

              scam. They have proven that Ades mosquitos are turning up
              in impossible areas and have to be getting air dropped.<br>
              <br>
              They did this by doing precipitation and temperature
              analysis, and have proven that in the areas the Ades
              mosquitos have shown up, there has been both inadequate
              precipitation, and temperatures that are a full 10 degrees
              celsius too low for Ades to hatch, or even live when
              released alive.<br>
              <br>
              This is first hand information from speaking to the
              doctors directly.</small></font></big></font><b><font

            color="#000000"><small>Additionally, there have been many
              crappy looking 30 plus year old very large helicopters no
              one has seen before flying low over neighborhoods in
              Mexico, and when they fly over, the mosquitos show up.
              Even I have seen these. They look like old RAF Sea Kings
              that have not had maintenance for 20 years. They looked
              like they flew out of a junk yard. It is obvious this is
              where the mosquitos, which clearly do not belong, are
              coming from. (the helicopter to the left here is a similar
              type, and is not in bad condition)<br>
              <br>
              The doctors have stated also that it is obvious the
              mosquitos are being dropped, because areas go from high
              levels of infestation to zero infestation in only 2 days,
              because the winter temperatures are too cold and are
              killing the released mosquitos outright. The helicopters
              have shown up in even my neighborhood and the mosquitos
              subsequently showed up in my house that afternoon, but
              were killed by the cold overnight.<br>
              <br>
              They have also said there have been cases of microcephaly
              in Mexico, and that not one baby born with it had been
              exposed to Zika. They are investigating the new Tdap shot.<br>
              <br>
              They are stressed out, and are blown away by the fact that
              they have proven that even the world health organization
              is involved in a political scam to scare the masses, and
              are additionally stressed out by the complicity of the
              media, which keeps parroting the lies despite being told
              in no uncertain terms what is really going on.<br>
              <br>
              When I conducted similar interviews a month ago, they were
              interested. But this time around, it was like their world
              was shattered.<br>
              <br>
              This is current info, I did the interviews on the 11th.
              The helicopters and mosquitos showed up on the 8th.</small></font></big></font><b><font

              for what it did in Brazil via the medical system and
              vaccination programs, and it woke up doctors everywhere
              because it was too easy to prove Zika was not the cause of
              the problems. This has made doctors question why the
              "official" story is still Zika. The World Health
              organization, media, and many other scam outlets have
              taken a major credibility hit. The doctors clearly know it
              was vaccines that caused the birth defects, and know it
              was done intentionally. This is the main reason why "their
              worlds were shattered" as I mentioned above.<br>
              <br>
              To cover for vaccine damage, certain people in high places
              are pushing a pesticide scam to divert attention away from
              the vaccines. They do not care if people know it was not
              zika, but they DO care if the greater public becomes fully
              aware of vaccines doing it all. They are not focusing on
              fooling the doctors, who know the pesticides being blamed
              are in use everywhere, not only Brazil, and that there is
              no way the pesticides are going to pick Brazil only, or
              suddenly morph into birth defect monsters when they have
              no history of causing problems on such a massive scale.<br>
              <br>
              The NWO info hoaxers are also now trying to diminish the
              impact by undermining reported cases of microcephaly and
              pawning it all off on statistical variations. Be aware of
              these scams, the NWO has been totally busted and they may
              be able to fool the general public, but they are now going
              to have to kill an awful lot of doctors to keep it all
              buried.<br>

              is the dumbing down of populations via sabotage of
              vaccines and destruction of education taking place, We now
              know Zika is a probable scapegoat for it all, and how they
              are going to front the scam. This report is basically a
              red alert, and now I will repeat an old report that lays
              out precisely how vaccines will be used to destroy
              mankind:<br>

              vaccinated, a new DNA modifying virus based bioweapon
              designed to make people less intelligent in a way that
              gets passed along to the children is being distributed via
              vaccines, and the "zika" scam is the first test run.<br>
              <br>
              Modified bacteriophage viruses were the original go-to
              choice for gene manipulation by tyranny<br>
              <br>
              Unlike ordinary viruses which can infect or live in
              several species of animal, bacteriophages - which prior to
              being engineered to do otherwise - only infected bacteria
              and additionally were so selective, they only infected one
              bacteria sub group. This could be compared to a dog
              disease that only killed golden retrievers, while leaving
              a golden lab untouched<br>
              <br>
              This selectivity that phages are capable of has been used
              in Israel's race specific bioweapons program, and
              additionally, can be used in brain eating vaccines which
              contain "viruses" that only attack a specific type of
              neuron.<br>
              <br>
              There have been many reports about genetically engineered
              nanobot viruses being developed that will destroy people.
              Once these viruses are received via a tainted vaccine,
              they insert DNA into your cells which instructs your own
              cells to produce more copies of the virus, which then goes
              to other cells and repeats the process. While doing so, a
              virus that has been programmed to put new DNA into a cell
              and then allow that cell to live can make permanent
              changes to the DNA of people, and make the children those
              people have turn out completely different from what the
              parent originally was.<br>

              The elite are now going for a huge push to get genetically
              modified bacteriophage based "vaccines" put into the
              entire world public via mandated injections AT ONCE. They
              already tried this with ebola and failed. Zika is likely
              to be the next scam, and this time around they are already
              saying that the "virus" is causing permanent genetic
              changes to make people stupid. This is being done by them
              in an effort to meet their goals of subverting mankind by
              creating inferior sub groups while having people be
              oblivious to the fact that the real dumbing down happened
              via the vaccine they received to "protect them from it".<br>
              <br>
              Anyone who is with it enough to find a web site like this
              one ought to know about the NWO plan for global
              depopulation and the establishment of compact slave cities
              that can be managed with ease. What better way could there
              be to manage a massive depopulation than a fake outbreak,
              with the real disease being in mandated shots, peddled as
              vaccines that are supposed to protect? What better way
              could there possibly be to, while administering death
              shots, give all the survivors a massive reduction in
              intelligence that will stay with all future children,
              forever?<br>
              <br>
              Mark my word: THIS is why they are pushing vaccines so
              hard, and now actively working to destroy completely
              legitimate dissent.<br>

              Despite all the public hoopla, all the cases of
              microcephaly being discovered in Brazil have never been
              scientifically linked to the Zika virus. A group of
              doctors from South America are now saying the brain
              deformations the world is witnessing are caused by the
              mass fumigation of low-income Brazilian people with a
              chemical larvicide, not by mosquitoes carrying the Zika
              virus.<br>
              <br>
              What we're seeing with the brain deformations of children,
              in other words, is more like the history of thalidomide, a
              prescription medicine given to pregnant women that caused
              children to be born with limbs missing. But the official
              narrative on all this is pushing a false link with Zika in
              order to justify more chemical fumigation, more vaccines
              and more genetically engineered mosquitoes.<br>
              <br>
              From the doctors at Red Universitaria de Ambiente y Salud
              (the Red University of Environment and Health), with h/t
              to GM Watch: (SOURCE document)<br>
              <br>
              A dramatic increase of congenital malformations,
              especially microcephaly in newborns, was detected and
              quickly linked to the Zika virus by the Brazilian Ministry
              of Health. However, they fail to recognise that in the
              area where most sick persons live, a chemical larvicide
              producing malformations in mosquitoes has been applied for
              18 months, and that this poison (pyroproxyfen) is applied
              by the State on drinking water used by the affected
              population.<br>
              <br>
              It looks like the world's health authorities are using
              Zika virus mosquitoes as a cover story to conceal the
              damage caused by toxic chemicals manufactured by powerful
              globalist corporations.<br>
              <br>
              The larvicide sprayed in Brazil, for example, is called
              "pyriproxyfen," and it's manufactured by Sumitomo
              Chemical, a corporation known to be a "strategic partner"
              of Monsanto. The Argentinian doctors' report lists
              Sumitomo as a "subsidiary" of Monsanto. As GM Watch
              reports, "Pyriproxyfen is a growth inhibitor of mosquito
              larvae, which alters the development process from larva to
              pupa to adult, thus generating malformations in developing
              mosquitoes and killing or disabling them." …</small></font></big></font><br>

              The invention discloses a plant physical therapy device
              based on a high-voltage electrostatic field. The device is
              mainly composed of an upper flow water pipe, a backflow
              water pipe, a nutrient solution supplementing pipe, an
              electromagnetic valve, a pump, an electrostatic shielding
              cover, a positive electrode plate, a negative electrode
              plate, a pair of fans, a culturing groove, a high voltage
              generator, a temperature and humidity sensor, an
              illumination intensity sensor, a computer control
              terminal, an optical sensor, an ion concentration sensor,
              a pH sensor and a measuring cup. Through providing
              appropriate illumination, temperature, humidity and the
              electrostatic field environment for plant growth, nutrient
              absorption and luminous energy utilization of a plant are
              promoted to the greatest degree, so that plant growth and
              development are promoted, and the physiological properties
              of the plant are optimized. Accurate fertilization and
              fertilization according to needs can be achieved, the
              usage amount of fertilizers can be reduced, and the
              utilization rate of the fertilizers can be increased; the
              plant physical therapy device has an electrostatic
              pest-killing function, and pesticide pollution can be
              eliminated. The plant physical therapy device can be
              applied to scientific research on yield increasing of
              pollution-free crops and practical production of the
              pollution-free crops.<br>

              she couldn't afford to access the articles needed for her
              research, and it's since gone viral, with hundreds of

              or pulmonary metastases were treated with electrostatic
              therapy (EST). The patients were treated with either low
              voltage (200 to 1200 V), high voltage (500 to 2500 V), or
              high voltage together with high magnetic field. At six
              months after EST, tumour regression was observed in two
              cases, relief of symptoms, but no change in tumour size,
              in five cases, and no effect of EST in nine patients. In

              was first discovered in 1752 by Benjamin Franklin of
              America, who proved that lightning is caused by
              electricity generated between the clouds and the ground.
              Owing to this discovery, it was later found that
              electricity is effective in the treatment of various kinds
              of ailments.<br>
              <br>
              In 1776, Hiraga Gennai of Japan made an electric generator
              called the “Electriciteit” which was believed to be
              effective for relieving pain and was used widely with
              patients. The Electriciteit continued to enjoy popularity
              among doctors treating rheumatism and neuralgia until the
              19th century.<br>
              <br>
              In Europe, according to medical dictionaries of the 10th
              century, electrostatic potential therapy apparatuses of
              different types from those in Japan were clinically in use
              at the time.<br>
              <br>
              The advances of research and development with regard to
              electrostatic potential therapy apparatuses in Japan led
              to clinical applications that were carried out for more
              than 50 years. Today, many types designed for household
              use are widely available in addition to those for
              professional use in medical institutions.<br>

                Electrostatic Potential Therapy Enhances The Power Of
                Natural Healing<br>
                <br>
              </font></big></font></b><font color="#660000"><big><font
              color="#000000">A human body consists of approximately 6
              billion cells that carry out a wide range of functions.
              The general function of the body activates a feedback
              mechanism that helps to maintain an optimum environment
              for these cells to perform all their vital activities. In
              other words, when the external environment changes, the
              body functions to optimize its internal environment
              including the osmotic pressure of body fluids, the gaseous
              composition and electrolyte composition of the blood, pH
              and body temperature. For the purpose of maintaining this
              constancy of its internal environment, the cells and
              organs of our body are controlled by a feedback mechanism
              that is based upon cooperation among the nervous,
              endocrinal and immune systems.<br>
              <br>
              This constancy that is maintained within the internal
              environment of our bodies is called “homeostasis” and, in
              effect, is maintained by the cooperation among our systems
              and the regulating mechanism of our individual organs.<br>
              <br>
              We need to maintain homeotasis if we are to continue to
              live. We get sick when our homeostasis is significantly
              disturbed, but we also have an automatic mechanism that
              works to maintain homeostasis (the feedback mechanism).
              This is called the “homeostasis mechanism” or “natural
              healing power”. The body can recover from illnesses if the
              degree of the homeostasis disturbance is within the limits
              of our natural healing power. If it exceeds these limits,
              the result is death. Natural healing power, in other
              words, is the power to prevent illness or to help us
              recover from illness. Electrostatic potential therapy
              using an electrostatic potential therapy apparatus works
              to enhance the natural healing power that maintains
              homeostasis within our systems.<br>
              <br>
              “All vital mechanisms, regardless of how varied they may
              be, have only one objective, that objective consists
              solely of the preservation of the conditions of life
              within the internal environment of our bodies.” (19th
              century French physiologist Claude Bernard)<br>
              <br>
              Therapeutic device is a medical instrument that imparts an
              alternating current potential to an electrically insulated
              human body*, thereby surrounding the body with an
              electrical field that has a beneficial effect. The
              electrical field apparatus stimulates the skin’s sense
              receptors via nerves. This stimulation ultimately acts on
              the body’s regulatory mechanisms such as the autonomic
              nervous systems, or hypothalamus, in the brain.</font></big></font><b><font

              color="#000000">Just one of the benefits of these effects
              is that the body’s homeostatic functions are kept in
              healthy levels by restoring the amounts of electrolytes in
              the blood (specifically, sodium, potassium, and calcium
              ions) to their normal values. This enables the body to
              recover from various unpleasant symptoms.<br>
              <br>
              * The virtual absence of an electric current means that
              the user experiences no shocks, tingling, or unpleasant
              sensation whatsoever.<br>

              is usually given after diagnosis. Such diagnosis is based
              on tests designed to discover irregularities in various
              parts of the body. However, it is difficult for tests to
              detect “semi-healthy” conditions, such as headaches, stiff
              shoulders, insomnia, and chronic constipation, which are
              often seen in today’s stressful society. Such conditions
              often fail to be diagnosed as ill health.<br>
              <br>
              Oriental medicines, on the other hand, is based on the
              concept of gozo roppu (five vital and six internal
              organs), whereby health is thought to depend on the normal
              functioning of all these organs to maintain an optimum
              balance (homeostasis). The collapse of this balance causes
              a variety of symptoms to develop, including aches and
              pains, stiffness, hot flushes, and chills. Oriental
              medicine views these symptoms as indicators of
              “semi-health”, and considers them to be warning signs of
              the onset of illness. In order to enhance the human body’s
              natural healing powers, diverse therapeutic methods have
              been practiced from ancient times, including kampo
              (oriental herbal medicine), acupuncture, kyu
              (moxibustion), and amma massage.</font></big></font><b><font

              Last month, a 79-year-old Shanghai citizen in Putuo
              district suddenly died in a crowd. He was in a crush of
              elderly people waiting for free ginseng capsules. A month
              later, however, almost the same free deals are still being
              offered throughout the city under the guise of health
              products and therapies. It seems that the death hasn't
              dampened the senior residents' passion for "free lunches."
              Critics suggest that many of these health deals and

              center across the road sees scores of elderly citizens
              lining up. They're waiting for badges to be handed out by

              compounds," she said.<br>

              lecturer), the machines can treat high blood pressure,
              diabetes, insomnia, constipation, strokes, slipped discs
              and as many other problems as you can name. "Electrostatic
              therapy is essentially a process in which the body cells
              are 'recharged' by these special high-voltage devices that
              transmit safe electric current to human body," she told
              the Global Times.<br>
              <br>
              She elaborated: "Our bodies are made up of some 60
              trillion cells. And every cell in our body has a tiny
              electrical charge of up to 90 millivolts. Pollution and
              city lifestyles mean that these cells have to be
              constantly recharged to stay healthy."<br>
              <br>
              Ruijin Hospital, one of the leading hospitals in town,
              told the Global Times that the hospital is not equipped
              with the so-called electrostatic therapy devices and
              doctors with the hospital's rehabilitation department said
              they had heard of the devices but were totally unaware of
              any scientific backing for a cell recharging theory.<br>
              <br>
              Importantly, the services provided at the center are not
              without drawbacks. "After I had been visiting the place
              for two or three weeks, the manager here suggested that I
              should buy one of the machines and take it home to achieve
              better results. She implied that it would be unnecessary
              for my children to know about the issue as long as I could
              afford it myself. But it's not a small sum. I haven't done

              said that this machine could only be used in the treatment
              of insomnia, constipation and chronic fatigue syndrome,

              elderly people who have paid up. "On average, we sell six
              or seven of these every month," Hong said when pushing to
              make a sale.<br>
              <br>
              Seventy-six-year-old Song is one who bought an
              electrostatic therapy machine. She made the purchase at a
              health care store which was also offering free trials in
              Baoshan district. In September, the old lady, who suffers
              heart problems and high blood pressure, spent 10,000 yuan
              on a machine along with 8,000 yuan on other&nbsp;
              "medicines" at the store.<br>
              <br>
              When Song's children took her to hospital for a health
              check in October, however, she was found to have higher
              blood pressure than before. She finally confessed that
              after using the device and taking the pills from the
              store, she stopped taking the medicines prescribed by the
              hospital doctors.<br>
              <br>
              Her daughter-in-law Li was angry. "We wanted to take the
              device to that store and ask for a refund. But my mother
              insisted that we did not do this." Reportedly the sales
              techniques used by these health care companies, offering
              free trials, friendly service and care for seniors, have
              worked very effectively on many elderly clients.<br>
              <br>
              "It's essentially brainwashing. Many seniors, like my
              parents, truly believe in it. They are now seriously
              considering buying a machine," said 40-something Lin, who
              was checking the registration and product information of
              one of the machines for his parents in a health store on
              Taopu Road in Putuo district. "If I don't buy it for them,
              I will be denounced as being a bad son. It's been the
              cause of arguments in the family for a while."<br>
              <br>
              But city industrial and commercial authorities were quoted
              by Xinmin Evening News as receiving very few complaints
              from residents about these machines.</font></big></font><b><font

              comparatively big sums of money from a small number of
              senior citizens, others have a seemingly less aggressive
              approach. On Xixiang Road in Putuo district, a health care
              store focuses on treatments for heart disease and strokes.
              This store uses magnetic therapy equipment and has been
              offering free services to the elderly.<br>
              <br>
              Zhang Guanmei is the manager there and said the store
              didn't recommend that people buy the machines. "It's more
              than 2,000 yuan a piece. It's not cheap. Old people are
              welcome to come for a treatment every day. It's totally
              free," she told the Global Times.<br>
              <br>
              However, Zhang says that clients must take special pills
              to enhance the treatments. These pills arrive with all the
              information, ingredients and instructions listed in
              English. Chinese regulations insist that all imported
              medicines sold in China have to have the details listed in
              Chinese. The pills have no drug approval number or
              production date and the company's website as shown on the
              package is not accessible.<br>
              <br>
              A bottle of 60 pills recommended by Zhang is priced at 400
              yuan, but a daily dosage of four to six pills means that a
              bottle will only last 10 days. A course of treatment at
              the store lasts six months. Without buying a machine
              there, customers will still have to pay up to 7,200 yuan
              for the pills for a six-month course of treatment.<br>
              <br>
              As well the "high-tech" equipment, magnetic necklaces and
              bracelets, which are advertised to be protection from
              heart disease and high blood pressure, are also cheating
              senior citizens out of their money.</font></big></font><b><font

              "Singapore Young PAP Discussion Forum: A posting (May 1,
              2005) quotes, " SINGAPORE : More than 10,000 senior
              citizens in the heartlands have been getting free
              electrostatic current treatment for their various health
              problems over the last two-and-a-half years. But it is not
              any voluntary welfare organisation that is offering this
              service, but a business corporation. Is there a catch?<br>
              <br>
              For 74-year-old Li Feng Qing, she goes for therapy there
              daily at 7am. But some are sceptical. A lady said: "I have
              tried the therapy seven or eight times but I feel no
              effect at all. Maybe the other elderly are coming here for
              psychological reasons." While getting a buzz in the
              electro-static treatment in a room, they listen to a staff
              member who gives tips on healthy living, and the benefits
              of the product. The machines are priced at some $12,000
              each. (Singapore dollars) They are said to create a 9,000
              volt electric field, and when channelled into the body
              through the chair mats, is said to help raise one's
              metabolism rate and improve the immune system.<br>
              <br>
              But does it really work?<br>
              <br>
              Another lady said: "I have only been using this for less
              than two months and I see results. I no longer suffer from
              headaches and dizziness, or aches at my elbows and legs."
              Kent Tay, Managing Director of COSMO Healthcare, said: "We
              have a lot of certificates, the ISO certificate as well as
              the Singapore safety authority certificate, these are all
              original copies that we have got. "Basically this machine
              is for external usage and they have gone through 28 years
              in Japan, till today they are promoting this technology."<br>
              <br>
              But most doctors think otherwise.<br>
              <br>
              Dr Low Lip Ping, Chairman of the Singapore Heart
              Foundation, said: "There is no scientific evidence that
              there is any benefit from electrostatic therapy. "The
              benefit is largely psychological, there is the well
              known-placebo effect. For example, you give somebody
              placebo, in other words medication that has no effect to
              the person, and his blood pressure can decrease to some
              extent."<br>

              Negatively-charged static electricity exists naturally in

              beneficial to repel the world's maladies. It is a 100%
              naturally occurring energy so it does not yield harmful
              side effects. Static electricity is therefore one of the

              the machine does this is the inventor's trade secret. When
              the body is surrounded by this electric field, it creates
              an environment wherein the cancer cells and viruses cannot
              reproduce and mutate, and will eventually die. All of this

              electrostatic therapy in a matter of one week to one month
              time. However, it might be difficult to expect 100%
              recovery from stage 3 cancer. Chance of recovery starts to
              diminish at stage 3 cancer cases as the cancer cells start
              to metastasize and spread to other organs. For stage 4
              cancer, the chance of recovery is very slim (though not
              impossible), and the PYRO-ENERGEN may only help ease the
              pain and increase the survival rate or life expectancy of
              the patient. If your cancer is stage 0 up to the beginning
              of stage 3, then expect recovery to be amazingly fast and
              satisfactory.<br>
              <br>
              We know that prevention is better than cure. When you are
              healthy, the use of PYRO-ENERGEN can prevent you from

              color="#000000">We are fully aware of the existence of AC
              high voltage therapy machines. They are being marketed
              under several different names: "electrostatic field
              therapy", "high-voltage electric field therapy", "static
              electricity therapy", "high potential therapy", etc. Most
              of these machines have the numbers "9000" affixed on their
              brand names. But they're all entirely the same thing—they
              operate by producing high voltage alternating current (AC)
              with output voltage that varies from 3000-9000 volts.<br>
              <br>
              Although it looks like these devices operate similarly to
              the PYRO-ENERGEN machine, they are completely different.
              The PYRO-ENERGEN machine is way ahead in terms of healing
              technology, efficacy, and safety, compared to machines
              that utilize AC voltage.<br>
              <br>
              AC electric fields are generally man-made and harmful to
              health when exposed for a long period of time. The
              PYRO-ENERGEN uses DC electric field (which exists
              naturally in our environment) to produce
              negatively-charged static electricity, which do not have
              side effects and NO current and voltage penetrate the
              body. It also emits negative ions at the same time, albeit
              in smaller amount.</font></big></font><b><font

              Medicine, the coordination of vital essence, qi, and mind
              is treated as the main guiding principle, especially in
              the respect of qi (so-called energy for the western
              natural medical scholars). When applying drug or non-drug
              therapy to the human body dysfunction, qi is attributed to
              be the effect. Thanks for the help of western science that
              the so-called qi can be measured with instrument by a lot
              of scholars doing research on qi. A portion of qi
              relatively close to material (there is also a portion
              relatively close to spirit) is composed of several kinds
              of micro-energy (Infrared, negative ion current, magnetic
              wave, etc.), which makes using instrument of qi can be a
              possible hope for treating illness. There are already
              so-called Qigong machine in the market; however, the
              treating mechanism and the application scope thereof are
              still quite limited. Inspired by chance, this inventor
              finds a more complete theory regarding this aspect, and
              manufactures an instrument, electrostatic current

              The kinetic energy of liquids can be increased by several
              methods described in the present application. The methods
              include exposure to a magnetic field provided by a
              rotating or vibrating magnet; exposure to an
              electromagnetic field provided by an electrical power
              cord; and placement of the liquid within the vicinity of
              electrostatic energy and/or sound energy. A previously
              described method is the bubbling of electrolysis-generated
              water gas (Brown's Gas) into the liquid. The increased
              kinetic energy can be demonstrated using a previously
              described neutral red dye kinetic assay (NR-Kinetic
              assay). Energized liquids include alcohol, alcoholic
              beverages and water. The use of the energized solutions to
              enhance the alternative cellular energy (ACE) pathway in

              PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED: To apply a negative charged sheet to
              the prevention of bedsores. SOLUTION: This negative
              charged sheet for use in percutaneous electric analgesic
              therapy has its negative charged surface intimately and
              fixedly contacted with the part of the skin where bedsores
              are likely to occur, thereby promoting blood flow in that
              part, and producing a bedsore preventive effect. An
              adhesive is applied in a pattern to the back face of the
              negative charged sheet so as to prevent a negative charge
              from being lost greatly and to assure the adhesiveness of
              the negative charged surface to the skin. The adhesiveness
              of the negative charged sheet to the skin can be secured
              approximately completely even on skin surfaces at bending
              or stretching parts of the body.<br>

      <br>
      When one looks at the deplorable state of the world, one cannot
      help but wonder at the insouciance of the American people. Where
      are they? Do they exist or are they a myth? Have they been put to
      sleep by an evil demon? Are they so lost in The Matrix that they
      cannot get out?<br>
      <br>
      Ever since Clinton’s second term the US has been consistently
      acting internationally and domestically as a criminal,
      disregarding its own laws, international laws, the sovereignty of
      other countries, and the US Constitution. A worse criminal
      government has never existed. Yet, Americans remain subservient to
      the criminals that they have placed in power over themselves.<br>
      <br>
      According to polls, Hillary Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders are
      splitting the Democratic vote 50-50 as preferred Democratic
      presidential candidate. This is extraordinary.<br>
      <br>
      Hillary Clinton represents the interests of Wall Street and the
      mega-banks, the Israel Lobby, and the interests of the
      military/security complex. These interests are totally opposed to
      the interests of the American people.<br>
      <br>
      In his book, What’s the Matter with Kansas, Thomas Frank raised
      the question of why Americans vote against their own interests?
      Why do Americans go to the voting both and do themselves in?<br>
      <br>
      Whether you agree with Thomas Frank’s answer or not, Americans do,
      on a regular basis, harm themselves by voting for people who are
      agents of vested interests diametrically opposed to the interests
      of American citizens.<br>
      <br>
      How is it possible, if Democrats are informed people, that half of
      them prefer Hillary Clinton? Between February 2001 and May 2015
      Bill and Hillary collected $153 million in speaking fees. The fees
      averaged $210,795 per speech.
http://www.commondreams.org/news/2016/02/06/no-artful-smear-clintons-paid-153-million-speaking-fees-analysis-shows<br>
      According to this report, the Clintons are also paid off by
      Zionists: <br>
      <br>
http://www.globalresearch.ca/the-clintons-earned-over-3-5-million-in-paid-addresses-to-pro-israel-organizations/5507562<br>
      <br>
      I can remember when Bill and Hillary were in public office when
      their speeches were free. No one wanted to listen to them when the
      speeches were free. Clearly, Bill is being paid off for his past
      services to the powerful interest groups that control the United
      States, and Hillary is being paid off for her future service to
      the same groups.<br>
      <br>
      How then is it possible that half of Democrats would prefer
      Hillary? Is it because she is a woman and women want a woman
      president more than they want their civil liberties, peace, and
      employment for themselves, their spouses and their children?<br>
      <br>
      Or is it because, given the presstitute character of the American
      media, the people haven’t a clue?<br>
      <br>
      If you vote for Hillary, you are voting for someone who has been
      paid off to the tune of $153 million by powerful vested interests
      who have no concern whatsoever for your interests. In addition,
      Hillary has the necessary campaign funds from the powerful
      interest groups for her presidential nomination campaign. As if
      this isn’t damning enough, Hugh Wharton writes that the National
      Democratic Committee is in league with Hillary to steal, if
      necessary, the nomination from Sanders and the voters.
http://usuncut.com/news/the-dnc-superdelegates-just-screwed-over-bernie-sanders-and-spit-in-the-faces-of-voters/<br>
      <br>
      In contrast, the interest groups who rule America are not
      contributing to Sanders.<br>
      <br>
      Therefore, the choice of Sanders is obvious, but 50% of Democrats
      are too braindead to see it.<br>
      <br>
      Although Hillary is a substantial threat to America, the threat of
      nuclear war is much greater, and the Democratic Obama regime in
      the hands of neoconservatives has just greatly amplified the
      threat of nuclear war.<br>
      <br>
      The United States government, or perhaps we should say the
      exploiter and deceiver of the American people, has announced a
      three-fold increase in its military presence on Russia’s borders.
      The excuse for this great boost in the profits and power of the US
      military-security complex is “Russian aggression.”<br>
      <br>
      But there is no sign of this aggression. So Washington and its
      servile presstitutes in the Western media make it up. They
      proclaim a lie.<br>
      <br>
      “Russia invaded Ukraine” proclaims the propaganda. No mention is
      made of Washington’s coup in Ukraine that overthrew a
      democratically elected government and began a war against the
      Russian populations of eastern and southern Ukraine, former
      provinces of Russia added to the Ukrainian Soviet Republic by
      Soviet leaders. In the presstitute media, no mention is made of
      Washington’s intention of seizing Russia’s only warm water port in
      Crimea on the Black Sea.
http://www.fort-russ.com/2016/02/us-control-over-crimea-aim-of-coup-in.html<br>
      <br>
      Having created a nonexistant Russian invasion in place of the real
      US coup in Ukraine in the minds of the indoctrinated Americans,
      Washington now claims that Russia is going to invade the Baltics
      and Poland. Nothing could be further from the truth, but this lie
      from the Obama regime now determines that the US military presence
      on Russia’s borders will increase three-fold.<br>
      <br>
      The escalation of the US/NATO threat on Russia’s borders forces a
      Russian response. Considering that the Russophobic governments in
      Poland and the Baltic States have unstable judgement, military
      buildups bring risks of miscalculations.<br>
      <br>
      There is a limit to the level of threat that the Russian
      government can tolerate. The impotent Obama is in the firm grip of
      the neoconservatives and the military-security complex. The
      neoconservatives are motivated by their ideology of American world
      hegemony. The military-security complex is motivated by power and
      profit. These motives bring the United States and its vassals into
      conflict with Russia’s (and China’s) sovereign existence.<br>
      <br>
      Within the councils of American foreign policy there is not
      sufficient weight to counter the neoconservative drive to war with
      Russia and China. In conventional war, the US is not a military
      match for the Russian/Chinese strategic alliance. Therefore, the
      war would be nuclear. The power of hydrogen bombs is immensely
      more powerful that the atomic bombs that the US dropped on Japan.
      Nuclear war means the end of life on earth.<br>
      <br>
      Americans can know that democracy has failed them, because there
      is no check on the neoconservatives’ ability to foment war with
      Russia and China.<br>
      <br>
      The neocons control the press, and the press portrays Russia as
      “an existential threat to the United States.” Once this fiction is
      drilled into the brains of Americans, it is child’s play for
      propagandists to create endless fears that deplete taxpayers of
      income in order to create profits for the military-security
      complex by relaunching the Cold War and an armaments race.<br>
      <br>
      That is what is currently going on. The inability of Americans to
      realize that they are being taken into a conflict that benefits
      only the profits and power of the military-security complex and
      the ideology of a small group of crazies demonstrates the
      impotence of American democracy.<br>
      <br>
      Universities and think tanks are replete with ambitious people
      who, chasing grants and influence, fuel the Russophobic hysteria.
      For example, on February 9 the Washington Post published an
      article by Michael Ignatieff, the Edward R. Murrow professor at
      Harvard University’s Kennedy School, and Leon Wieseltier, the
      Isaiah Berlin Senior Fellow at the Brookings Institution in
      Washington. The article is a complete misrepresentation of the
      facts in Syria and called for US measures that would result in
      military conflict with Russia. It was irresponsible for the
      Washington Post to publish the article, but the decision is
      consistent with the Post’s presstitute nature.
https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-era-of-us-abdication-on-syria-must-end/2016/02/09/55226716-ce96-11e5-88cd-753e80cd29ad_story.html<br>
      <br>
      The propaganda line maintained by the US government, the
      neoconservatives, the military/security complex, the presstitutes,
      and fiction-writers such as Ignatieff and Wieseltier is that
      Russia is not bombing the Islamic State jihadists who are
      attempting to overthrow the Syrian government in order to
      establish a jihadish state that would threaten the Middle East,
      Iran, and Russia herself. The official line is that the Russians
      are bombing the democratic “rebels” who are trying to overthrow<br>
      an alleged “brutal Syrian dictator.” The conflict that the US
      government started by sending ISIS to Syria to overthrow the
      Syrian government is blamed on the Russian and Syrian governments.<br>
      <br>
      Ignatieff and Wieseltier say that the US has put its “moral
      standing” at risk by permitting the Russians to bomb and to starve
      innocent women and children, as if the US had any moral standing
      after destroying seven countries so far in the 21st century,
      producing millions of dead and displaced persons, many of whom are
      now overrunning Europe as refugees from Washington’s wars.<br>
      <br>
      The recently retired head of the Defense Intelligence Agency,
      Michael Flynn, has said that the Obama regime made a “willful
      decision” to support ISIS and use ISIS against the Assad
      government in Syria. That the violence in Syria originated in a
      US/ISIS conspiracy against Syria is ignored by Ignatieff and
      Wieseltier. Instead, they blame Russia despite the fact that it is
      Russia’s air support for the Syrian Army that has rolled back
      ISIS.<br>
      <br>
      Where were Ignatieff and Wieseltier when Washington and its
      vassals destroyed Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Afghanistan, Yemen, much
      of Pakistan, overthrew the first democratically elected government
      in Egypt, overthrew the government in Ukraine and started a war
      against the Russian population, and supplied Israel with the
      weapons and money to steal Palestine from the Palestinians? Where
      were they when Clinton destroyed Yugoslavia and Serbia? Where are
      they when ISIS murders Syrians and eats the livers of its executed
      victims?<br>
      <br>
      It would be interesting to know who financed the professorship in
      Edward R. Murrow’s name and the fellowship in Isiah Berlin’s name
      and how these positions came to be staffed with their current
      occupants.<br>
      <br>
      Reagan and Gorbachev brought the Cold War to an end. The George
      H.W. Bush administration supported the end of the Cold War and
      gave further guarantees to Russia. But Clinton attacked Serbia, a
      Russian ally and broke the agreement that NATO would not expand
      into Eastern Europe to Russia’s border. When the neoconservatives’
      plans to invade Syria and to attack Iran were frustrated by
      Russian diplomacy, the neocons turned on Russia with fury.<br>
      <br>
      In 1961 President Eisenhower warned the American people of the
      threat posed by the military-security complex. That was 55 years
      ago. This complex is so strong today that it is able to divert
      massive taxpayer resources to its coffers while the living
      standard and economic prospects of the American people decline.<br>
      <br>
      The military/security complex requires an enemy. When the Cold War
      ended, the “Muslim Threat” was created. This “threat” has now been
      superceded by the “Russian Threat,” which is much more useful in
      keeping Europe in line and in scaring people with prospective
      invasions and nuclear attacks that are far beyond the power and
      reach of jihadists.<br>
      <br>
      Superpower America required a more dangerous enemy than a few
      lightly armed jihadists, so the “Russian threat” was created. To
      drive home the threat, Russia and her president are constantly
      demonized. The conclusion is unavoidable that the insouciant
      American people are being prepared for war.<br>

            color="#000000">A new simple nanowire manufacturing
            technique uses self-catalytic growth process assisted by
            thermal decomposition of natural gas. According to the
            research team, this method is simple, reproducible,
            size-controllable, and cost-effective in that lithium-ion
            batteries could also benefit from it.<br>
            <br>
            In their approach, they discovered that germanium nanowires
            are grown by the reduction of germanium oxide particles and
            subsequent self-catalytic growth during the thermal
            decomposition of natural gas, and simultaneously, carbon
            sheath layers are uniformly coated on the nanowire surface.
            <br>
            <br>
            In a study, reported in the January 21, 2016 issue of Nano
            Letters, the team demonstrated a new redox-responsive
            assembly method to synthesize hierarchically structured
            carbon-sheathed germanium nanowires (c-GeNWs) on a large
            scale by the use of self-catalytic growth process assisted
            by thermally decomposed natural gas.<br>
            <br>
            According to the team, this simple synthetic process not
            only enables them to synthesize hierachially assembled
            materials from inexpensive metal oxides at a larger scale,
            but also can likely be extended to other metal oxides as
            well. Moreover, the resulting hierarchically assembled
            nanowires (C-GeNWs) show enhanced chemical and thermal
            stability, as well as outstanding electrochemical
            properties.<br>
            <br>
            The team states, "This strategy may open up an effective way
            to make other metallic/semiconducting nanomaterials via
            one-step synthetic reactions through an environmentally
            benign and cost-effective approach."</font></big></font><b><font

            Illinois mechanical science and engineering professor Kyle
            Smith and graduate student Rylan Dmello published their work
            in the Journal of the Electrochemical Society.<br>
            <br>
            Smith said: “By publishing this paper, we’re introducing a
            new type of device to the battery community and to the
            desalination community.”<br>
            <br>
            The most-used method, reverse osmosis, pushes water through
            a membrane that keeps out the salt, a costly and
            energy-intensive process. By contrast, the battery method
            uses electricity to draw charged salt ions out of the water.<br>
            <br>
            The researchers were reportedly inspired by sodium ion
            batteries, which contain salt water. Batteries have two
            chambers, a positive electrode and a negative electrode,
            with a separator in between that the ions can flow across.
            When the battery discharges, the sodium and chloride ions –
            the two elements of salt – are drawn to one chamber, leaving
            desalinated water in the other.<br>
            <br>
            In a normal battery, the ions diffuse back when the current
            flows the other direction. The Illinois researchers had to
            find a way to keep the salt out of the now-pure water.<br>
            <br>
            “In a conventional battery, the separator allows salt to
            diffuse from the positive electrode into the negative
            electrode,” Smith said in a statement. “That limits how much
            salt depletion can occur. We put a membrane that blocks
            sodium between the two electrodes, so we could keep it out
            of the side that’s desalinated.”<br>
            <br>
            The battery approach is said to hold several advantages over
            reverse osmosis. The battery device can be small or large,
            adapting to different applications, while reverse osmosis
            plants must be very large to be efficient and cost
            effective, Smith said. The pressure required to pump the
            water through is much less, since it’s flowing the water
            over the electrodes instead of forcing it through a
            membrane. This translates to much smaller energy needs,
            close to the very minimum required by nature, which in turn
            translates to lower costs. In addition, the rate of water
            flowing through it can be adjusted more easily than other
            types of desalination technologies that require more complex
            plumbing.<br>
            <br>
            Smith and Dmello conducted a modelling study to see how
            their device might perform with salt concentrations as high
            as seawater, and found that it could recover an estimated
            80% of desalinated water. Their simulations don’t account
            for other contaminants in the water, however, so they are
            working toward running experiments with real seawater.<br>
            <br>
            “We believe there’s a lot of promise,” Smith said. “There’s
            a lot of work that’s gone on in developing new materials for
            sodium ion batteries. We hope our work could spur
            researchers in that area to investigate new materials for
            desalination. We’re excited to see what kind of doors this
            might open.”<br>

            When practicing and learning a new skill, making slight
            changes during repeat practice sessions may help people
            master the skill faster than practicing the task in
            precisely the same way, Johns Hopkins researchers report.<br>
            <br>
            In a study of 86 healthy volunteers asked to learn a
            computer-based motor skill, those who quickly adjusted to a
            modified practice session the second time around performed
            better than when repeating their original task, the
            researchers found. The results support the idea that a
            process called reconsolidation, in which existing memories
            are recalled and modified with new knowledge, plays a key
            role in the strengthening of motor skills, says senior study
            author Pablo A. Celnik, M.D., professor of physical medicine
            and rehabilitation at the Johns Hopkins University School of
            Medicine.<br>
            <br>
            “What we found is if you practice a slightly modified
            version of a task you want to master, you actually learn
            more and faster than if you just keep practicing the exact
            same thing multiple times in a row,” says Celnik. The work,
            described in the Jan. 28 edition of the journal Current
            Biology, has implications not only for leisure skills, like
            learning to play a musical instrument or a sport, but also
            for helping patients with stroke and other neurological
            conditions regain lost motor function, he says.<br>
            <br>
            “Our results are important because little was known before
            about how reconsolidation works in relation to motor skill
            development. This shows how simple manipulations during
            training can lead to more rapid and larger motor skill gains
            because of reconsolidation,” says Celnik. “The goal is to
            develop novel behavioral interventions and training
            schedules that give people more improvement for the same
            amount of practice time.”<br>
            <br>
            For the study, volunteers came to Celnik’s laboratory to
            learn and perform an isometric pinch task over the course of
            two or three 45-minute sessions. This entailed squeezing a
            device called a force transducer to move a computer cursor
            across a monitor. The screen test featured five windows and
            a “home space.” Participants were asked to move the cursor
            from home to the various windows in a set pattern as quickly
            and accurately as possible.<br>
            <br>
            The volunteers were randomly assigned to one of three
            groups. The first group completed a typical training
            schedule where after the initial training session, they
            repeated the exact same training lesson six hours later —
            based on previous studies, the amount of time believed
            needed to consolidate memories from the first session — and
            again the next day. The second group performed the first
            practice session and, after six hours, completed a second
            training session in which Celnik and colleagues had tweaked
            the test so that the force needed to be changed ever so
            slightly in every trial. In this manner, individuals had to
            constantly adjust their performance despite not being aware
            of the subtle modifications. The next day, these
            participants returned to the lab and were asked to repeat
            the same task they were given during the first session. The
            third “control” group performed the exact same task just
            once each day, skipping the second training session
            altogether.<br>
            <br>
            Celnik says the gains in performance, such as a speedier and
            more accurate completion of the task, nearly doubled among
            those in the second group, who were given the altered second
            session, compared to those in the first group, who repeated
            the same task.<br>
            <br>
            Highest gains were seen among those subjects who were able
            to quickly adapt to the change in conditions. Participants
            in the third group, who skipped the second session,
            performed approximately 25 percent worse than those in the
            first group.<br>
            <br>
            Celnik says the alterations in training have to be small,
            something akin to slightly adjusting the size or weight of a
            baseball bat, tennis racket or soccer ball in between
            practice sessions. Current studies by Celnik’s team, still
            underway and not yet published, suggest that changing a
            practice session too much, like playing badminton in between
            tennis bouts, brings no significant benefit to motor
            learning.<br>
            <br>
            “If you make the altered task too different, people do not
            get the gain we observed during reconsolidation,” he says.
            “The modification between sessions needs to be subtle.”<br>

        spewing LETHAL LEVELS of naturally-occurring Uranium, Radon and
        other radioactive materials&nbsp; into the air around Los
        Angeles. Parts of the city may be "uninhabitable" for years!<br>
        <br>
        In October, 2015, a gas well began leaking in the Aliso Canyon
        gas storage field, in the Porter Ranch area of Los
        Angeles.&nbsp; Now, it has been revealed that
        naturally-occurring radiation from ground Uranium, has also been
        spewing out of that leaking well and so much has come out, that
        the situation constitutes a "Massive Radiation
        Emergency."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The photo below shows how severe
        the well is leaking.&nbsp; The photo is INFRA-RED so you can see
        the otherwise invisible gas:<br>
        <br>
        As you can see from the image above, the leak is huge, and the
        plume of gas stretches literally for MILES above heavily
        populated and wealthy areas of Los Angeles.<br>
        <br>
        Southern California Gas is trying to seal the leak, but things
        aren't going as planned.&nbsp; Below is a graphic showing how
        the Company hopes to seal the leak:<br>
        <br>
        The trouble is that the volume of gas is coming out so
        forcefully, it has been described as being "like a volcano" and
        all efforts to shut the leak down have thus far failed.&nbsp;
        Sadly, those efforts have only served to "destabilize the well"
        causing other leaks to begin in other areas of the gas
        field.&nbsp; Late last week, officials described the leak as
        "totally out of control."<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        <b>RADIATION</b><br>
        <br>
        According to experts from the International Association for
        Protection from Ionizing Rays (AIPRI) in France, lethal levels
        of naturally-occurring radiation are coming out of the well and
        people will die from that radiation.<br>
        <br>
        The “methane” coming out of the well is usually called Natural
        Gas. It normally contains “natural radioactive materials” that
        are made in the inside of exploding stars. They are things like
        Uranium 238 and Radon which have been here since the planet was
        formed. They are in the very dirt of the Earth and thus are in
        natural gas, naturally. You can’t have one without the other.<br>
        <br>
        AIPRI notes the rogue well is spewing huge amounts of Natural
        Gas and about 1.91 Curie an hour maximum of natural radioactive
        material in the natural gas. Not much, you think? That is about
        45.95 Curies per day. It is a really, really big leak of natural
        gas and the radiation it always carries.<br>
        <br>
        A Curie is a unit of measure used in the United States to
        describe very large radioactive releases easily and this is a
        very big radioactive release.<br>
        <br>
        The French Becquerel is a much more human sized unit of measure
        for radiation. One Becquerel is one Radioactive Disintegration
        (Count) per Second. One Curie equals 37 Billion Becquerels or
        Radioactive Counts per Second. One point Seven Trillion
        Becquerels per day spew from the Natural Gas well. That’s a
        number with a bunch of Zeros – a real Fukushima-class&nbsp;
        disaster number, right here in the USA.<br>
        <br>
        From Europe, AIPRI finds:<br>
        <br>
        “In 80 days of viscous and gaseous fumes at a breakneck pace of
        1.7 million m3 per day (1115 tons per day at a rate of 46 tons
        per hour escape from the underground storage), 136 million m3
        Natural gas dispersed in the air could carry with them having
        TBq 301.24 (3,01E14 Bq) is 8.14 KCI natural radioactivity for
        respirable (breathable) emanation of 12.060 Million Sieverts is
        equivalent 2.41 million potential lethal doses by inhalation
        according to the same dose coefficients from the International
        Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP).”<br>
        <br>
        Recently, however, officials in California began to publicly
        acknowledge that the amount of gas spewing from the well had
        been dramatically under-estimated.&nbsp; In fact, officials now
        admit that THREE TIMES AS MUCH GAS has been leaking as
        originally thought!<br>
        <br>
        Using the same analysis from the AIPRI and the ICRP but with the
        newest numbers as to the amount of gas leaking, AIPRI amended
        their report to say the following:<br>
        <br>
        If the leak, as it is now admitted, is actually 3 times greater
        i.e. 5.1 million m3 of effluent per day (3346 tons per day),
        with the same content per meter cube of radon 222 the natural
        radionuclides contained in the underground gas would skyrocket
        to 30.75 MBq (3.53 mCi) per second, of 470.69 GBq (12,72 Ci) per
        hour, 11.30 TBq (305.31 Ci) per day for an excursion in 90 days
        1.02 PBq (27,48 KCi) a dispersion of 40.7 million Sieverts
        representing 8.14 million lethal doses by inhalation.<br>
        <br>
        What it all means is it is time for people in LA and the San
        Fernando Valley to get out of town.&nbsp; All the homes in the
        path of the gas leak are now contaminated with radiation.&nbsp;
        It is on the roofs, on the sidewalks, the grass, the furniture
        in the backyards, children's swings, sliding ponds, play toys
        and sand boxes outside.&nbsp; It has drifted INSIDE those homes
        via open windows.&nbsp; It's on the floor where you walk into
        the house, on the chairs where you sit (after it fell on your
        clothes outside as you walked into the house).&nbsp; It's on
        your pillows in bed, after radiation got onto your hair outside,
        and on your bed sheets, from exposed body parts where radiation
        fell on them outside.&nbsp; It's everywhere.<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        <b>NOSEBLEEDS, VOMITING are from RADIATION SICKNESS!</b><br>
        <br>
        Many residents of Chatsworth, Northridge and Granada Hills have
        been complaining of nosebleeds, vomiting and diarrhea which they
        attribute to smelling the gas or the chemical odorant added to
        it to allow people to smell it.&nbsp; But the symptoms of
        nosebleeds, vomiting and diarrhea are ALSO signs of radiation
        sickness!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sadly, no one has bothered to ask
        their Doctors to check them for radiation sickness, even though
        the cause of these troubles can be directly linked to that exact
        cause!<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        <b>EXPLOSION DANGER GROWING</b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        Natural Gas can explode if exposed to an ignition source like a
        pilot light on a stove or in a hot water heater.&nbsp; Less
        likely is a spark from a light switch, or a bad distributor cap
        or spark plug wire in a car.<br>
        <br>
        Those of you who have seen stories in the past about "gas
        explosions" in homes or buildings, know that such explosions are
        utterly devastating.&nbsp; The photo below shows the results of
        a single home exploding in Indianapolis, IN.&nbsp; The explosion
        destroyed thirty (30) homes!<br>
        <br>
        This is what Chatsworth, Northridge and Granada Hills will look
        like if the gas plume floating above those homes, ignites!&nbsp;
        The only difference will be that the entire communities would be
        flattened, not just a few homes.&nbsp; The deaths and injuries
        from such an event would be mind-boggling, yet people are not
        being told how dangerous this leak is, and many are remaining in
        the area!<br>
        <br>
        <b>KEPT QUIET - DELIBERATELY </b><br>
        <br>
        Why the public in Los Angeles is not being told this by
        authorities is simple to understand: They don't want a panic on
        their hands and, more importantly, they don't want business and
        industry to be shut down, costing jobs and billions in tax
        revenues to be lost.<br>
        <br>
        Put simply, it is better for the government to keep you in the
        dark to collect tax money than it is for them to admit what's
        happening, have you leave, and thus cut-off their cash from your
        labor.&nbsp; The fact that many of you will die is really not
        important to them.<br>
        <br>
        Don't believe us? Buy your own little Geiger Counter and take
        some readings yourself. Folks in the area where this gas is
        blowing will see radiation counts exceeding 2,000
        counts-per-minute.&nbsp; In some cases, exceeding that by many
        times. Then ask the California Highway Patrol what their
        criteria is for a "Radiation Emergency?"&nbsp; They'll tell you
        "Any reading of 500 Counts-Per-Minute CPM or higher is
        considered a radiation emergency."&nbsp; It's been their
        protocol for years.&nbsp; Same thing with the LA Fire
        Department.&nbsp; Ask them.&nbsp; They'll tell you.<br>

      Intelligent windows, capable of cleaning themselves while also
      regulating the temperature of the building and reducing glare from
      sunlight, have been developed in the UK.<br>
      <br>
      A scanning electron miscroscope photograph shows the pyramid-like
      nanostructures engraved onto glass: at 200nm they are 100 times
      smaller than a human hair. Controlling the surface morphology at
      the nanoscale allows scientists to tailor how the glass interacts
      with liquids and light with high precision<br>
      <br>
      <div align="center"><img alt="" src="Window.jpg" height="284"

      <br>
      Buildings consume 40 per cent of the energy used in the developed
      world, with heating and cooling accounting for around two-thirds
      of this.<br>
      <br>
      The smart windows, which have been developed at University College
      London (UCL) with funding from EPSRC, could help reduce the cost
      of cleaning the large number of windows in modern office
      buildings, cut energy use and slash heating bills by up to 40 per
      cent.<br>
      <br>
      The windows are engraved with a series of pencil-like conical
      nanostructures. These trap air and ensure only a tiny amount of
      water touches the surface of the glass.<br>
      <br>
      As a result, any rain hitting the windows forms into spherical
      droplets that simply roll off the glass surface, picking up dust
      and dirt in their path as they do so.<br>
      <br>
      In contrast, raindrops hitting conventional windows cling to the
      glass, causing them to slide down it and leave streaks and dirt
      behind.<br>
      <br>
      The pattern of the nanostructures also gives the windows the same
      anti-reflective properties as the eyes of creatures such as moths,
      which allow them to hide from predators. This reduces glare by
      cutting the amount of light reflected internally within a room, to
      less than five per cent. This compares with 20-30 per cent for
      other prototype energy saving windows.<br>
      <br>
      Finally, the nanostructured windows are then coated with a thin
      film of vanadium dioxide on top. This prevents heat escaping from
      the building on cold days, and stops infrared radiation from
      sunlight passing through the glass on hot days.<br>
      <br>
      That is because vanadium dioxide is a thermochromic material,
      meaning it can switch from blocking all infrared radiation to
      allowing it to pass through, depending on the temperature applied
      to it.<br>
      <br>
      Unlike the gold or silver coatings used in some smart windows,
      vanadium dioxide is a cheap and abundant material. What’s more,
      only a very thin layer of between 5-10 nanometres of the material
      is needed, making it more cost-effective and sustainable than
      other technologies.<br>
      <br>
      The windows are the first to combine this thin thermochromic
      coating with a nanostructure engraving, according to the project
      leader Dr Ioannis Papakonstantinou at UCL.<br>
      <br>
      The two technologies complement each other, with the nanostructure
      helping to enhance the thermochromic properties of the coating, he
      said.<br>
      <br>
      That is because unlike smooth films of vanadium dioxide, which
      require a very large area to achieve a thermochromic effect, the
      nanostructures increase the surface area of the film
      significantly. “If you compare the [surface] area of planar films
      with our nanostructured material, you will see that we have
      enhanced the area by over ten times,” he said.<br>

      This means only a very thin layer is needed to achieve the same
      effect as much thicker smooth films, he said.<br>
      <br>
      The researchers are in discussions with UK glass manufacturers in
      a bid to commercialise the smart windows. This will involve
      scaling up the manufacturing methods the researchers have
      developed to produce the nanostructured glass, as well as the
      coating process used.<br>
      <br>
      If these discussions are successful, the researchers believe the
      smart windows could be commercially available within three to five
      years. They have been awarded a five-year European Research
      Council grant to build the windows and test them under realistic
      conditions.<br>
      <br>
      Meanwhile, the team is also hoping to develop a smart polymer film
      incorporating the nanostructures, which could be applied to
      existing windows to offer the same self-cleaning and energy-saving
      benefits.<b><br>

            awkward and fragile objects</b></big><br>

      <b><br>
      </b>Electrostatic forces are the key to a new kind of gripper that
      can grasp and manoeuvre odd-shaped and fragile objects without
      damaging them<br>
      <br>
      Moving fragile objects is a major issue for many industries,
      notably food and drink. Natural objects like fruits and vegetables
      have unique and unpredictable shapes and sizes, and often must not
      be damaged as they are moved around. This makes packing and
      handling difficult to automate, and necessitates human
      involvement, which pushes up producer costs and therefore
      increases prices.<br>
      <br>
      Soft robotics – making robotic manipulators out of plastics and
      gels – is a promising avenue for development of automated
      equipment which can handle this problem. Generally soft robots
      mimic some aspect of human physiology to gently grip and move
      items while conforming to their shape, exerting enough force to
      take the item’s weight without damaging it. At the Ecole
      Polytechnique Fedéral de Lausanne (EPFL), researchers have
      developed a soft robotic gripper that uses electrostatic forces to
      pick up objects of arbitrary shape and stiffness, such as eggs,
      water-filled balloons of pieces of paper.<br>
      <br>
      The robot’s fingers are flaplike and consist of five layers: a
      pre-stretched elastomer sandwiched between two layers of a
      flexible electrode; this whole assembly is also sandwiched between
      two layers of silicone of differing thicknesses. With no current
      running through the electrode layers, the differing thicknesses of
      the silicone make the flaps bend outwards; when switched on, the
      electrodes first straighten and then bend inwards, mimicking the
      action of muscles. The tips of the electrodes have an
      interdigitated pattern, resembling interlaced fingers; this is
      designed to maximise electrostatic attraction; the effect that
      makes a balloon stick to a wall when it’s been rubbed on hair or
      clothing. The force this generates can lift 80 times the weight of
      the electrodes, the team claims in a paper in Nature Materials.<b><br>

      <br>
      According to NRA (Nuclear Regulation Authority), Cs-134/137
      density in Tokyo tap water is 24% higher than Fukushima.<br>
      <br>
      The report was released on 10/30/2015, titled as “Readings of
      radioactivity level in drinking water by prefecture” to cover from
      July to September in 2015.<br>
      <br>
      From this report, only 0.0015 Bq/Kg of Cs-137&nbsp; was detected
      in Fukushima drinking water. Cs-134 was not supposed to be
      detected. On the other hand, 0.00036 Bq/Kg of Cs-134 and 0.0015 of
      Bq/Kg were detected from Tokyo drinking water.<br>
      <br>
      The measurement of Cs-134 is due to Fukushima accident.<br>
      <br>
      NRA comments each data is based on the reports from prefectures.<br>
      <br>
      It is not mentioned by Fukushima prefectural government why Cs-134
      was not detected in their drinking water.<br>

            leak worsened blowout risk, regulators say </b></big><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Southern California Gas Co… is trying to avoid a blowout, which
      state regulators said is now a significant concern after a seventh
      attempt to plug the well created more precarious conditions at the
      site. If a blowout occurs, highly flammable gas would vent
      directly up through the well… rather than dissipating as it does
      now… State officials said a blowout would increase the amount of
      leaked gas… That natural gas also creates the risk of a massive
      fire… The risk of fire already is so high that cellphones and
      watches are banned from the site… [The gas company's attempts to
      stop the leak] expanded a crater around the wellhead, state and
      gas company officials said. The crater is now 25 feet deep, 80
      feet long and 30 feet wide, those officials said… [The gas
      company] declined repeated requests from The Times… The gas
      company would not provide current photos of the site or allow
      media access… In one internal state report obtained by The Times,
      an agency official described [one] kill effort as a “blowout to
      surface.” “A large column of gas, aerated mud, and rock formed a
      geyser around the wellhead,” the state observer wrote.<br>
      <br>
      Scott McGurk, senior oil and gas field regulator assigned to daily
      watch at Aliso Canyon, Jan 15, 2016: The site and wellhead were
      made more unstable by the gas company’s attempts to stop the leak
      by pumping a slurry directly into the well… The wellhead sits
      exposed within the cavernous space, held in place with cables
      attached after it wobbled during the plugging attempt… During one
      of [the plugging] attempts Nov. 13, a hole in the ground opened 20
      feet north of the well… Gas that had seeped through diffuse rock
      fissures on the western side of the narrow ridge began streaming
      instead from the new vent… the vent allowed a “serious amount of
      gas” to escape...<br>

      Over two decades later, the Brazilian medium Chico Xavier confided
      to close friends that, upon the arrival of man to the moon on July
      20, 1969, occurred a meeting with the heavenly powers of our solar

      Thymosin is a hormone produced by the thymus gland and has been
      directly related to the aging process by University of Texas
      medical researchers. Allan Goldstein, director of the biochemistry
      division of the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston
      reported on his work recently at the annual meeting of the
      American Societies for Experimental Biology (Arizona Republic,
      4/17/73).<br>
      <br>
      Apparently thymosin levels in the blood decrease dramatically with
      age - "significantly between the ages of 25 to 45 in normal
      individuals," Goldstein said. Thymosin is also directly related to
      immunity, and injecting this hormone into mice increases their
      immunity and resistance to disease. (The thymus is the master
      gland of the immune system - the reticulo endothelial or the
      lymphatic system - and it has been known now for more than ten
      years that cells from the thymus migrate to other portions of the
      body and become centers of lymphatic activity.&nbsp; It has not
      been shown, as far as I know, whether these centers of lymphatic
      activity - such as Peyer's patches - also produce the same
      hormones that come from the thymus.) Goldstein reported that
      patients with Hodgkin's disease and chronic leukemia have low
      blood levels of thymosin, and that "failure of the thymus gland to
      function properly is a major factor in a number of debilitating
      and often fatal diseases of children and adults."..<br>

      Researchers from North Carolina State University have discovered a
      new phase of solid carbon, called Q-carbon, which is distinct from
      the known phases of graphite and diamond. They have also developed
      a technique for using Q-carbon to make diamond-related structures
      at room temperature and at ambient atmospheric pressure in air.<br>
      <br>
      Phases are distinct forms of the same material. Graphite is one of
      the solid phases of carbon; diamond is another.<br>
      <br>
      "We've now created a third solid phase of carbon," says Jay
      Narayan, the John C. Fan Distinguished Chair Professor of
      Materials Science and Engineering at NC State and lead author of
      three papers describing the work. "The only place it may be found
      in the natural world would be possibly in the core of some
      planets."<br>
      <br>
      Q-carbon has some unusual characteristics. For one thing, it is
      ferromagnetic – which other solid forms of carbon are not.<br>
      <br>
      "We didn't even think that was possible," Narayan says.<br>
      <br>
      In addition, Q-carbon is harder than diamond, and glows when
      exposed to even low levels of energy.<br>
      <br>
      "Q-carbon's strength and low work-function – its willingness to
      release electrons – make it very promising for developing new
      electronic display technologies," Narayan says.<br>
      <br>
      But Q-carbon can also be used to create a variety of
      single-crystal diamond objects. To understand that, you have to
      understand the process for creating Q-carbon.<br>
      <br>
      Researchers start with a substrate, such as sapphire, glass or a
      plastic polymer. The substrate is then coated with amorphous
      carbon – elemental carbon that, unlike graphite or diamond, does
      not have a regular, well-defined crystalline structure. The carbon
      is then hit with a single laser pulse lasting approximately 200
      nanoseconds. During this pulse, the temperature of the carbon is
      raised to 4,000 Kelvin (or around 3,727 degrees Celsius) and then
      rapidly cooled. This operation takes place at one atmosphere – the
      same pressure as the surrounding air.<br>
      <br>
      The end result is a film of Q-carbon, and researchers can control
      the process to make films between 20 nanometers and 500 nanometers
      thick.<br>
      <br>
      By using different substrates and changing the duration of the
      laser pulse, the researchers can also control how quickly the
      carbon cools. By changing the rate of cooling, they are able to
      create diamond structures within the Q-carbon.<br>
      <br>
      "We can create diamond nanoneedles or microneedles, nanodots, or
      large-area diamond films, with applications for drug delivery,
      industrial processes and for creating high-temperature switches
      and power electronics," Narayan says. "These diamond objects have
      a single-crystalline structure, making them stronger than
      polycrystalline materials. And it is all done at room temperature
      and at ambient atmosphere – we're basically using a laser like the
      ones used for laser eye surgery. So, not only does this allow us
      to develop new applications, but the process itself is relatively
      inexpensive."<br>
      <br>
      And, if researchers want to convert more of the Q-carbon to
      diamond, they can simply repeat the laser-pulse/cooling process.<br>
      <br>
      If Q-carbon is harder than diamond, why would someone want to make
      diamond nanodots instead of Q-carbon ones? Because we still have a
      lot to learn about this new material.<br>
      <br>
      "We can make Q-carbon films, and we're learning its properties,
      but we are still in the early stages of understanding how to
      manipulate it," Narayan says. "We know a lot about diamond, so we
      can make diamond nanodots. We don't yet know how to make Q-carbon
      nanodots or microneedles. That's something we're working on."<br>
      <br>
      NC State has filed two provisional patents on the Q-carbon and
      diamond creation techniques.<br>

      We report the discovery of a new phase of carbon (referred to as
      Q-carbon) and address fundamental issues related to direct
      conversion of carbon into diamond at ambient temperatures and
      pressures in air without any need for catalyst and presence of
      hydrogen. The Q-carbon is formed as result of quenching from super
      undercooled state by using high-power nanosecond laser pulses. We
      discuss the equilibrium phase diagram (P vs. T) of carbon and show
      that by rapid quenching kinetics can shift thermodynamic
      graphite/diamond/liquid carbon triple point from 5000 K/12 GPa to
      super undercooled carbon at atmospheric pressure in air. It is
      shown that nanosecond laser heating of diamond-like
      amorphouscarbon on sapphire, glass, and polymer substrates can be
      confined to melt carbon in a super undercooled state. By quenching
      the carbon from the super undercooled state, we have created a new
      state of carbon (Q-carbon) from which nanodiamond, microdiamond,
      microneedles, and single-crystal thin films are formed depending
      upon the nucleation and growth times allowed for diamond
      formation. The Q-carbon quenched from liquid is a new state of
      solid carbon with a higher mass density than amorphouscarbon and a
      mixture of mostly fourfold sp3 (75%–85%) with the rest being
      threefold sp2 bonded carbon (with distinct entropy). It is
      expected to have new and improved mechanical hardness, electrical
      conductivity, chemical, and physical properties, including
      room-temperature ferromagnetism (RTFM) and enhanced field
      emission. Here we present interesting results on RTFM, enhanced
      electrical conductivity and surface potential of Q-carbon to
      emphasize its unique properties. The Q-carbon exhibits robust bulk
      ferromagnetism with estimated Curie temperature of about 500 K and
      saturation magnetization value of 20 emu g−1. From the Q-carbon,
      diamond phase is nucleated and a variety of micro- and
      nanostructures and large-area single-crystal diamond sheets are
      grown by allowing growth times as needed. Subsequent laser pulses
      can be used to grow nanodiamond into microdiamond and nucleate
      other nanostructures of diamond on the top of existing
      microdiamond and create novel nanostructured materials. The
      microstructural details provide insights into the mechanism of
      formation of nanodiamond, microdiamond, nanoneedles, microneedles,
      and single-crystal thin films. This process allows
      carbon-to-diamond conversion and formation of useful
      nanostructures and microstructures at ambient temperatures in air
      at atmospheric pressure on practical and heat-sensitive substrates
      in a controlled way without need for any catalysts and hydrogen to
      stabilize sp3 bonding for diamond formation.<br>

      <br>
      We report on fundamental discovery of conversion of amorphous
      carbon into diamond by irradiating amorphous carbon films with
      nanosecond lasers at room-temperature in air at atmospheric
      pressure. We can create diamond in the form of nanodiamond (size
      range &lt;100 nm) and microdiamond (&gt;100 nm). Nanosecond laser
      pulses are used to melt amorphous diamondlike carbon and create a
      highly undercooled state, from which various forms of diamond can
      be formed upon cooling. The quenching from the super undercooled
      state results in nucleation of nanodiamond. It is found that
      microdiamonds grow out of highly undercooled state of carbon, with
      nanodiamond acting as seed crystals.<br>

      </b>A team of undergraduates from the Indian Institute of Science
      Education and Research (IISER) at the College of Engineering in
      Trivandrum, India, has designed and constructed a portable
      college-level radio telescope for amateur radio astronomers. The
      students have developed a radio telescope and also data analysis
      tools that are affordable for schools and colleges, combining low
      cost and ubiquitous accessibility of resources needed to build
      these instruments. The team described the project in details in a
      paper published online on Jan. 12 on the arXiv pre-print server.<br>
      <br>
      "The telescope is dedicated to amateur radio astronomers ranging
      from high school students to college graduates," Devansh Agarwal,
      one of the co-authors of the paper, told Phys.org.<br>
      <br>
      While large radio telescopes are needed to detect radio waves from
      astronomical sources, the students have shown that a small one
      could also make great discoveries in the field of radio astronomy.
      A small radio telescope designed by the team was able to measure
      the brightness temperature of the sun. The scientists also
      demonstrated the usefulness of their telescope by detecting point
      sources such as Saturn and extended sources such as the galactic
      arm of our home galaxy Milky Way.<br>
      <br>
      The team revealed that by performing drift scans, the brightness
      temperature of the sun was calculated to near 10,000 K with a
      maximum error of 3.23 percent. Sources like Saturn and the
      galactic arm were confirmed by correlating the time of arrival of
      the source signal in the field of view of the telescope with the
      predicted times via free, open-source planetarium software called
      Stellarium, based on the team's pointing. The flux received from
      the sources was calibrated against the standardized data from
      various geostationary satellites.<br>
      <br>
      Agarwal notes that their radio telescope reached expectations when
      studying the sun and also works very well when detecting other
      astronomical sources.<br>
      <br>
      The radio telescope designed by IISER students consists of a
      satellite antenna, a satellite signal meter called 'satellite
      finder' and a microcontroller board named Arduino Uno.<br>
      <br>
      The antenna has a 68 cm parabolic dish reflector and a low noise
      block (LNB). According to the paper, LNB receives the radio signal
      from the satellite reflected by the dish and amplifies it. There
      is also a set-top box that powers the satellite finder and the
      LNB.<br>
      <br>
      Satellite finder is used for orienting satellite dishes towards
      geostationary satellites.<br>
      <br>
      "We have used a commercially available analog satellite finder (GC
      SF-02). Such a device acts as a square law detector and is used to
      read directly the intensity," the team wrote in the paper.<br>
      <br>
      Arduino Uno is a microcontroller board with a 10 bit analog to
      digital converter. It enables digitizing the intensity from the
      satellite finder at 10Hz sampling rate. The tool is connected to a
      personal computer.<br>
      <br>
      The students emphasize that their radio telescope, assembled from
      commonplace items, is an affordable and a versatile instrument to
      demonstrate the working of a radio telescope and to provide
      crucial hands-on experience with radio astronomy tools. It goes
      without saying that one of the main advantages of their instrument
      is its low cost.<br>
      <br>
      "In India, this telescope cost was less than $75. However, it is
      highly dependent on rates of components available at your place,"
      Agarwal said.<br>
      <br>
      The project also leaves a lot of space for future improvements.
      For instance, an increase in sensitivity would offer the
      opportunity to look at many other sources than just the sun.<br>
      <br>
      "All-sky visibility maps can be generated at a rudimentary level
      that would make one familiar with a bigger part of the radio sky,"
      the team concluded.<br>

      We have developed an affordable, portable college level radio
      telescope for amateur radio astronomy which can be used to provide
      hands-on experience with the fundamentals of a radio telescope and
      an insight into the realm of radio astronomy. With our set-up one
      can measure brightness temperature and flux of the Sun at 11.2 GHz
      and calculate the beam width of the antenna. The set-up uses
      commercially available satellite television receiving system and
      parabolic dish antenna. We report the detection of point sources
      like Saturn and extended sources like the galactic arm of the
      Milky way. We have also developed python pipeline, which are
      available for free download, for data acquisition and
      visualization. <br>

            change in rats</b></big><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      As brain cells age they lose the fibers that receive neural
      impulses, a change that may underlie cognitive decline.
      Researchers at the University of California, Irvine recently found
      a way to reverse this process in rats. The study was published
      Feb. 3, 2016 in The Journal of Neuroscience. Researchers caution
      that more studies are needed, but the findings shed light on the
      mechanisms of cognitive decline and identify potential strategies
      to stem it.<br>
      <br>
      "There's a tendency to think that aging is an inexorable process,
      that it's something in the genes and there's nothing you can do
      about it," said study co-author Gary Lynch. "This paper is saying
      that may not be true."<br>
      <br>
      The researchers studied dendrites—the branch-like fibers that
      extend from neurons and receive signals from other neurons—in
      rats. Evidence from other studies in rodents, monkeys, and humans
      indicates that dendrites dwindle with age and that this
      process—called dendritic retraction—occurs as early as middle age.<br>
      <br>
      The team, led by Lynch, Julie Lauterborn, and Linda Palmer, wanted
      to know whether dendritic retraction was already underway in
      13-month-old or "middle-aged" rats and, if it was, could they
      reverse it by giving rats a compound called an ampakine. Ampakines
      had previously been shown to improve age-related cognitive
      deficits in rats as well as increase production of a key growth
      factor, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the brain...<br>

      </b>A common over-the-counter drug, chopped down into nanoparticle
      size, stopped growth in a cancer tumor.<br>
      <br>
      Engineers at Washington University in St. Louis found a way to
      keep a cancerous tumor from growing by using nanoparticles of the
      main ingredient in common antacid tablets.<br>
      <br>
      The research team, led by Avik Som, an MD/PhD student, and Samuel
      Achilefu, PhD, professor of radiology and of biochemistry &amp;
      molecular biophysics in the School of Medicine and of biomedical
      engineering in the School of Engineering &amp; Applied Science, in
      collaboration with two labs in the School of Engineering &amp;
      Applied Science, used two novel methods to create nanoparticles
      from calcium carbonate that were injected intravenously into a
      mouse model to treat solid tumors. The compound changed the pH of
      the tumor environment, from acidic to more alkaline, and kept the
      cancer from growing.<br>
      <br>
      With this work, researchers showed for the first time that they
      can modulate pH in solid tumors using intentionally designed
      nanoparticles. Results of the research were recently published
      online in Nanoscale.<br>

      </b><b>Preparation of calcium carbonate nano particle material by
        air bubble liquid film process</b><br>
      The invention relates to a bubble liquid membrane method which
      prepares the material of calcium carbonate nanoparticle, belonging
      to the chemical nanometer material manufacture. The invention is
      processed in the bubble liquid membrane reactor. The process is as
      follows: calcium hydroxide aqueous suspension and carbon dioxide
      gas are used as the raw material; carboxylate aqueous solution is
      used as the coating agent; by using the gas strong dispersion
      function of the stirrer with bubble cap dish type, the adequate
      amount carbon dioxide bubble is obtained All calcium hydroxide
      aqueous suspension and carboxylate aqueous solution are separated
      into the liquid membrane which is thin enough by the bubble; the
      bubble is dispersed phase, the liquid membrane is continuous
      phase, the nanometer reaction environment is obtained, the
      interface between carbon dioxide and calcium hydroxide is
      significantly increased, and the mass and heat transfer is
      strengthened. Between the liquid membrane and the bubble or in the
      liquid membrane, the reactant carbonation reacts, nucleates and
      grows to obtain calcium carbonate nanoparticle, and then after the
      in-situ coating, calcium carbonate capsule nanoparticle is
      obtained. The surface of calcium carbonate capsule nanoparticle
      absorbs the massive gas to form the atmosphere interface which
      restrains conglobation, the mineralized vacuolar membrane is
      formed, after the mineralized vacuolar membrane is filtered and
      dried, calcium carbonate capsule nanoparticle powder material is
      formed.<br>

            Cells Are Obliterated By Resonant Frequencies</b></big><br>

      A new cancer treatment is using resonant frequencies to shatter
      various types of cancer cells.<br>
      <br>
      In his Tedx Talk, “Shattering Cancer with Resonant Frequencies,”
      Associate Professor and Director of Music at Skidmore College,
      Anthony Holland, tells the audience that he has a dream….<br>
      <br>
      Holland and a team of researchers … came across the work of a
      Chinese researcher, Dr. Mae-Wan Ho, who conjectured that live
      cells exhibit similar properties much like liquid crystals do.
      With this in mind, Holland and his team wondered if they could
      affect a cell by sending a specific electric signal, much like we
      do with LCD technology.<br>
      <br>
      After searching the patent database for a device that could
      accomplish the latter, they came across a therapeutic device
      invented by a New Mexico physician by the name of Dr. James Bare.
      The device uses a plasma antenna that pulses on and off, which, as
      Holland explains, is important because a constant pulse of
      electricity would produce too much heat and therefore destroy the
      cell.<br>
      <br>
      For the next 15 months, Holland and his team searched for the
      exact frequency that would directly shatter a living
      microorganism. The magic number finally came in the form of two
      inputs, one high frequency and one low. The high frequency had to
      be exactly eleven times higher than the low, which in music is
      known as the 11th harmonic. At this 11th harmonic, micro organisms
      begin to shatter like crystal glass.<br>
      <br>
      After practicing until they got efficient at the procedure,
      Holland began working with a team of cancer researchers in an
      attempt to destroy targeted cancer cells. First they looked at
      pancreatic cancer cells, eventually discovering these cells were
      specifically vulnerable between 100,000 – 300,000 Hz…<br>
      <br>
      In repeated and controlled experiments, the frequencies, known as
      oscillating pulsed electric field (OPEF) technology, killed an
      average of 25% to 40% of leukemia cells, going as high as 60% in
      some cases. Furthermore, the intervention even slowed cancer cell
      growth rates up to 65%. It was a double whammy.<br>
      <br>
      The team also found success attacking ovarian cancer cells. Most
      recently, they tested the treatment against the deadly super bug
      MRSA, an organism that is resistant to many common antibiotics.
      Thousands of people die every year from MRSA, Holland explains,
      and the drugs normally used against the pathogen are known to have
      toxic side effects. Incredibly, the frequency therapy eliminated
      antibiotic resistance, and researchers were able to introduce a
      small amount of antibiotic to kill the bug.<br>

      </b><b> </b><br>
      This was an historic experiment. I slightly altered the program on
      my F125 frequency generator (programming code to be listed below
      soon) and had some amazing results. For the first time in months
      of experiments, many many organisms were either
      immobilized/devitalized or totally disintegrated/destroyed. It was
      a night for dramatic observations and luckily I had my video
      camera with me. ..<br>
      <br>
      <b>Friday, June 22, 2007</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      Seem to have managed to duplicate the results from Feb. 18 2007
      this night. The key seems to be a program I developed on the F125
      frequency generator which uses a second RF carrier (called a
      'backfreq' in the F125 programming). When this second carrier is
      approximately 11X the main frequency for the Blepharisma
      (currently operating under the advice that 924 is a 'main'
      freuqency for Blepharisma), we seem to find at least one organism
      on the slide which is almost immediately affected by the plasma.
      The organism quickly stops all movement and over the course of the
      next 27 minutes becomes terribly mishapen with internal structures
      seeming to disintegrate. The original shape and internal
      structuring of the organism is never regained after running the
      experiment and the organism never swims again. We continue to see
      cilia movement for some time afterwards but the organism is not
      capable of any directed movement. I believe its normal biological
      functions are completely distrupted, meaning it cannot 'feed' in
      any way, cannot grow, cannot reproduce and cannot perform any of
      its normal biological functions. Royal Rife might call this
      organism 'devitalized'. For all practical purposes, the organism
      is rendered helpless and 'deactivated'. Were this a pathogenic
      organism, it's ability to cause disease might be ended.<br>
      <br>
      A series of time lapse photos taken over a period of about 20
      minutes. Note that the initial effects were seen almost
      immediately upon starting the experiment. Further refinement of
      this experiment is needed in order to determine with greater
      precision the most effective frequencies and the shortest amount
      of time possible to achive maximum 'deactivation' of the organism.
      Questions still remain, including: why all such organisms on the
      same slide were not so affected; if there is a relationship
      between the geomotry of the plasma bulb's electrodes and the
      effect induced on this organism, if the plasma wave is producing a
      directed scalar wave and numerous other questions remain. That
      being said, some level of success is seen here and in the February
      '07 experiments...<br>
      <br>
      <b>Sunday, Feb. 18, 2007</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      Here are a series of 'time lapse' photos taken during this
      experiment. Some success was seen in 'devitalizing' some
      Vorticella and also some Blepharisma. The Vorticella experiment
      ran a program on my frequency generator which I named
      "Vorticella10", which uses a second carrier wave whose frequency
      is approximately 10X the value of the audio range square waves
      being used to amplitude modulate the RF signal which is fed into
      the Phanotron plasma tube.<br>
      <br>
      The following photos are of a Blepharisma which underwent a 27
      minute program of frequency treatment using a computer program I
      wrote and named "Blepharisma10", which uses a second carrier
      frequency approximately 10X the frequency of the audio square wave
      being used to amplitude modulate the 27Mhz RF signal. Note how the
      first photos are a blur.... because the blepharisma is normally a
      fast swimmer... but as the plasma wave begins to affect the
      organism, it slows down, eventually stops swimming altogether,
      then slowly deforms, looses internal definition (internally
      disintegrates) and essentially 'disolves' before your eyes (under
      the microscope of course). The photos are sequential. Note how the
      organism gradually looses its normal shape and becomes
      'devitalized', no longer capable of its normal biological
      functions: (note: I later realized that my program
      "Blepharisma10.frq" had been given a second carrier of 11X 924Hz,
      which was actually intended for a program named
      "Blepharisma11.frq". I've since corrected this (June '07) in my
      list of frequency programs. The most effective program to date for
      Blepharisma seems to be "Blepharisma11.frq", which includes a 2nd
      carrier at 11X924HZ)…<br>

      There would appear to be a major discrepancy between what musician
      Antony Holland is saying in this TEDx video about his
      collaboration with professional scientists, and what those
      professional scientists are themselves saying :<br>
      <br>
      I found this radio show talk about Antony Holland's collaboration
      with cancer scientist Jonathan Brody (and there is also a
      transcript of this radio show here).<br>
      <br>
      <a

      </b><br>
      Brody allowed Holland to perform the cancer cell experiments in
      Brody's lab, under his watchful scientific eye. To start with,
      Holland was getting good results, but he was not properly
      following the scientific method (he messed things up with the
      control samples).<br>
      <br>
      So Brody got Holland to repeat his experiments again, this time
      with properly done controls, including a special type of control
      called a sham. This is when it started going wrong... I will quote
      directly from the radio show transcript:<br>
      <br>
      Jonathan Brody<br>
      Well, the pulsing basically caused the cells to become resistant
      to the drugs. And they grew better.<br>
      <br>
      Anthony Holland<br>
      This is really weird, because it's very opposite of what we saw in
      previous experiments.<br>
      <br>
      Jonathan Brody<br>
      Yeah.<br>
      <br>
      Gabriel Rhodes (the narrator of the radio show)<br>
      It's a disaster. It's a huge setback. It's shocking. The data show
      that in the plate of treated pancreatic cells, the ones pulsed
      with electromagnetic waves and given a tiny dose of chemo, 100% of
      the cancer cells were alive after treatment. Meaning not only did
      the pulsing not kill any cancer cells, but somehow, the pulsing
      seemed to protect the cancer cells from being killed by the chemo.
      Anthony is stunned. He keeps saying the same thing again and
      again.<br>
      <br>
      Anthony Holland<br>
      All the other experiments show completely different results. I
      don't understand that. It doesn't make any sense to me.<br>
      <br>
      Jonathan Brody<br>
      It's a slap in the face, isn't it?<br>
      <br>
      Anthony Holland<br>
      Yeah. Yeah.<br>
      <br>
      Jonathan Brody<br>
      Yeah. So I'll go through stepwise, OK? Because there's some things
      we definitely need to discuss here.<br>
      <br>
      Gabriel Rhodes<br>
      They talk for 45 minutes, going over every aspect of the
      experiment. Anthony had used a different microscope this time.
      Maybe that was a problem. The microscope light that Anthony used
      when he took time-lapsed photos of the experiments, was the light
      heating the cells? And the amp for the device had been outputting
      less power than usual. Maybe some of the components were damaged.
      But the upshot of these last experiments is different for Jon and
      Anthony. Anthony sees these results as a fluke, an outlier. The
      other results still seem valid to him.<br>
      <br>
      Jonathan Brody<br>
      But for Jon, there's only one truth. If they want to publish,
      they've got to do more experiments. Anthony has to reproduce and
      confirm those great earlier results with controls. For me, doing
      this for 20-some-odd years or whatever it is, it doesn't surprise
      me that it's going to be this complicated. But I'm in it for the
      long haul, as far as the collaboration is, to try to figure this
      out. And we'll just keep at it, OK?<br>
      <br>
      Anthony Holland<br>
      OK.<br>
      <br>
      Gabriel Rhodes<br>
      But that wasn't what happened. In fact, for an entire year, Jon
      wasn't sure what was going on. And neither was I. He offered to go
      up to Skidmore to set up a lab for Anthony there if he couldn't
      come back down to Philadelphia. But that didn't happen. And then
      Anthony became very hard to reach.<br>
      <br>
      And a couple of weeks after Jon talked to Anthony by phone for the
      first time in several months, I go and see Jon. He's decided to go
      up to Saratoga the following week to talk to Anthony face to face
      about the experiment. In the last year, Jon's become more of a
      skeptic, partly about the device itself, but also about the
      collaboration with Anthony. Why would Anthony just drop out like
      this?<br>
      <br>
      Jonathan Brody<br>
      If he really believes in it and he really believes those results,
      let's do it again. If you cured cancer cells, let's do it again.
      My lab is open. My lab is open. My expertise is open. I'm happy--
      you don't want to do it in Philadelphia? Let's do it in Saratoga.
      Ask him, why hasn't he taken me up on that? Let me ask you a
      question. If you knew you had something that killed cancer cells,
      and you believed in it, you really believed in it, you could wait
      a year to try to prove that because one set of experiments didn't
      work? I mean, come on.<br>
      <br>
      Gabriel Rhodes<br>
      This is one of the big differences between Jon and Anthony,
      between scientist and non-scientist. For Jon, having a year's
      worth of work suddenly thrown into question is a normal day at the
      office. But for Anthony, that's not normal. And it's not OK. The
      time in Jon's lab was a year of his life, where he felt like Jon
      kept moving the goal posts.<br>
      <br>
      I felt that way, too, sometimes as I was watching. Jon kept saying
      he was amazed at what he was seeing and just about convinced. But
      then he'd wake up in the middle of the night with another
      experiment or control that he wanted to run. And there was no
      telling when it would end, which for him, again, is normal. But
      now, Anthony wants to know, before he starts turning his life
      upside down again, what will count as proof enough for Jon? How
      many experiments?<br>
      <br>
      Anthony Holland<br>
      So let's say I do three weeks of experiment, and I only
      concentrate on these leukemia cells. And if I can kill at least
      20% every single time, every week, will that do it? Would that be
      enough? Or do you want to see pancreatic die, or do you want to
      see-- I mean, what exact buttons do I have to hit?<br>
      <br>
      Gabriel Rhodes<br>
      When Jon gets to Saratoga, he and Anthony embrace and smile. And
      they're clearly glad to see each other. But as soon as they start
      talking about the experiments, they start arguing. And they don't
      understand each other. Jon keeps coming back to the same point.<br>
      <br>
      Jonathan Brody<br>
      Why can't you accept that we haven't proven anything? In the court
      of scientific law, we haven't proven anything.<br>
      <br>
      Anthony Holland<br>
      But we have very intriguing results.<br>
      <br>
      Jonathan Brody<br>
      That's fine. I mean, if you want to leave it at that, you could
      say that. But there's a big difference between intriguing and
      promising results and actually showing and demonstrating that
      something works. There's a huge difference. So 10 years from now,
      would you still walk around campus and be like, you know what? I
      killed those cancer cells. I actually did that. I actually proved
      that this worked. Do you think, deep down, that's the way you
      feel? That's what I want to know.<br>
      <br>
      Anthony Holland<br>
      We're not just talking about the last experiment, right? We're
      talking about the whole thing. In general? Are you kidding? I
      would frame this chart showing 43% of the leukemia cells dead. And
      I would say, we nailed them.<br>
      <br>
      Jonathan Brody<br>
      Let me ask you a question. Let me ask you a question. If you're
      sitting on the cure for cancer, why aren't we doing the
      experiments?<br>
      <br>
      Anthony Holland<br>
      I can't afford it.<br>
      <br>
      Jonathan Brody<br>
      So you're telling me, you're willing to say to the world that you
      think you have the cure for cancer, but you can't afford it.<br>
      <br>
      Anthony Holland<br>
      Yeah.<br>
      <br>
      So it looks like at the first sign of difficulty, Anthony Holland
      gives up, and abandons the collaboration, leaving with no proof
      that his pulsed fields can treat cancer.<br>
      <br>
      However, this is not what Anthony Holland says in his video. In
      his video he gives the impression that he has succeed in killing
      cancer cells. But the scientist and cancer research expert he
      collaborated with, Jonathan Brody, says that there is no proof of
      this, and that the experiments did not lead to any conclusion one
      way or the other. So unless Anthony Holland is referring to
      another completely different scientific collaboration in his
      video, he would appear to be misrepresenting the truth of what
      happened.<br>
      <br>
      There is also an article discussing this radio show here.<br>

      All credit to Anthony Holland for trying; he put a year of his
      life into this research. And he did in his first run of the
      experiment on leukemia cells kill 30% more cells than in the
      controls. Sad that he did not persevere a bit longer, in order to
      try to obtain scientific proof.<br>

      <br>
      Time has been one of the most complicated and less studied
      scientific issues since ancient times<br>
      <br>
      Eight years ago, American and British scientists who conducted
      investigations in Antarctica made a sensational discovery. US
      physicist Mariann McLein told the researchers noticed some
      spinning gray fog in the sky over the pole on January 27 which
      they believed to be just ordinary sandstorm. However, the gray fog
      did not change the form and did not move in the course of time.
      The researchers decided to investigate the phenomenon and launched
      a weather balloon with equipment capable to register the wind
      speed, the temperature and the air moisture. But the weather
      balloon soared upwards and immediately disappeared.<br>
      <br>
      In a little while, the researchers brought the weather balloon
      back to the ground with the help of a rope attached to it before.
      They were extremely surprised to see that a chronometer set in the
      weather balloon displayed the date of January 27, 1965, the same
      day 30 years ago. The experiment was repeated several times after
      the researchers found out the equipment was in good repair. But
      each time the watch was back it displayed the past time. The
      phenomenon was called "the time gate" and was reported to the
      White House.<br>
      <br>
      Today investigation of the unusual phenomenon is underway. It is
      supposed that the whirl crater above the South Pole is a tunnel
      allowing to penetrate into other times. What is more, programs on
      launching people to other times have been started. The CIA and the
      FBI are fighting for gaining control over the project that may
      change the course of history. It is not clear when the US federal
      authorities will approve the experiment.<br>
      <br>
      Famous Russian scientist Nikolay Kozyrev conducted an experiment
      to prove that moving from the future to the past was possible. He
      substantiated his views with the hypotheses on instant information
      spreading through physical characteristics of time. Nikolay
      Kozyrev even supposed that "time could execute the work and
      produce energy." An American physics theorist has arrived at a
      conclusion that time is what existed before existence of the
      world.<br>
      <br>
      It is known that each of us feels a different course of time under
      different conditions. Once lightning hit a mountain-climber; later
      the man told he saw the lightning got into his arm, slowly moved
      along it, separated the skin from the tissues and carbonized his
      cells. He felt as if there were quills of thousands hedgehogs
      under his skin.<br>
      <br>
      Russian investigator of anomalous phenomena, philosopher and
      author of numerous books Gennady Belimov published his article
      under the headline "Time Machine: First Speed On" in the newspaper
      On the Verge of Impossible. He described unique experiments
      conducted by a group of enthusiasts led by Vadim Chernobrov, the
      man who began creation of time machines, devices with
      electromagnetic pumping in 1987. Today the group of enthusiasts
      can slow down or speed up the course of time using special impact
      of the magnetic field. The biggest slowing down of time made up
      1.5 seconds within an hour of the equipment's operation in labs.<br>
      <br>
      In August 2001, a new model of the time machine meant for a human
      was set in a remote forest in Russia's Volgograd Region. When the
      machine even operated on car batteries and had low capacity, it
      still managed to change the time by three per cent; the change was
      registered with symmetrical crystal oscillators.<br>
      <br>
      At first, the researchers spent five, ten and twenty minutes in
      the operating machine; the longest stay lasted for half an hour.
      Vadim Chernobrov said that the people felt as if they moved to a
      different world; they felt life here and "there" at the same time
      as if some space was unfolding. "I cannot define the unusual
      feelings that we experienced at such moments."<br>
      <br>
      Neither TV nor radio companies reported the astonishing fact;
      Gennady Belimov says the Russian president was not informed of the
      experiment. However, he tells that already under Stalin there was
      a Research Institute of the Parallel World. Results of experiments
      conducted by Academicians Kurchatov and Ioffe can be now found in
      the archives. In 1952, head of the Soviet secret police
      organization Lavrenty Beria initiated a case against researchers
      participating in the experiments, as a result of which 18
      professors were executed by shooting and 59 candidates and doctors
      of physical sciences were sent to camps. The Institute recommenced
      its activity under Khruschev. But an experimental stand with eight
      leading researchers disappeared in 1961, and buildings close to
      the one where experiments were conducted were ruined. After that,
      the Communist Party political bureau and the Council of Ministers
      decided to suspend researchers of the Institute for an uncertain
      period.<br>
      <br>
      The program was resumed in 1987 when the Institute already
      functioned on the territory of the Soviet Union. A tragedy
      occurred on August 30, 1989: an extremely strong explosion sounded
      at the Institute's branch office on the Anjou islands. The
      explosion destroyed not only the experimental module of 780 tons
      but also the archipelago itself that covered the area of 2 square
      kilometers. According to one of the versions of the tragedy, the
      module with three experimenters collided with a large object,
      probably an asteroid, in the parallel world or heading toward the
      parallel world. Having lost its propulsion system, the module
      probably remained in the parallel world.<br>
      <br>
      The last record made in the framework of the experiment and kept
      at the Institute archives says: "We are dying but keep on
      conducting the experiment. It is very dark here; we see all
      objects become double, our hands and legs are transparent, we can
      see veins and bones through the skin. The oxygen supply will be
      enough for 43 hours, the life support system is seriously damaged.
      Our best regards to the families and friends!" Then the
      transmission suddenly stopped.<br>

      <b>&nbsp;</b><b><br>
      </b><b>Sector of erupting anomalies.</b><br>
      <br>
      Disturbing news has been leaking out from the giant continent at
      the bottom of the world. Some scientists manning lonely outposts
      under the drifting and shifting aurora are nearly paralyzed with
      fear. Their clipped reports are being reviewed by astonished
      superiors back in the home countries.<br>
      <br>
      Russian researchers posted near the giant South Pole sub-glacial
      Lake Vostok have reported eerie anomalies and incidents over the
      past few years that sometimes seem to border on the frayed edge of
      creeping madness.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Artificial structure found under two miles of ice</b><br>
      <br>
      During April 2001 one of the world’s great secrets was revealed:
      an ancient structure or apparatus that lay encased miles under the
      hard Antarctic ice was detected by a roving spy satellite. The US
      military immediately moved to quash the reports and the mainstream
      news media dutifully complied.<br>
      <br>
      Despite the news blackout, reports still surfaced that a secretive
      excavation project had commenced on the heels of the discovery.
      Some European countries formally protested the excavation by the
      US military.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Excavation deep into the ice…What’s down there?</b><br>
      <br>
      “If it’s something the US military has constructed down there,
      then they’re violating the international Antarctic Treaty,” said
      an aide to Nicole Fontaine, at the time he was the European
      Parliament’s French president. “If not, then it’s something that’s
      at least 12,000 years old, which is how long ice has covered
      Antarctica. That would make it the oldest man-made structure on
      the planet. The Pentagon should heed the calls of Congress and
      release whatever it’s hiding.”<br>
      <br>
      The federal government and the Pentagon ignored the calls.<br>
      <br>
      <b>High technology and strange events</b><br>
      <br>
      Soon after, some military observers noted that robotic devices
      were being shipped to the South Pole and speculation erupted about
      the belief by some that the US Air Force had transported their
      mammoth nuclear-powered tunel boring machine, the Subterrene, on a
      C5-A to a secret Antarctic base.<br>
      <br>
      The Subterrene, a cylindrical vessel that is said manned with a
      crew of four to six, is capable of subterranean travel and has
      undergone tests in Nevada, Colorado and New Mexico. Designed to
      bore through hard rock strata, drilling into the ice would be like
      a laser cutting through a marshmallow.<br>
      <br>
      Following the frenzied events, of early 2001, the news broke of a
      mysterious medical emergency that forced an evacuation of unnamed
      personnel during the depths of the Antarctic winter–the first
      event of its kind during the dangerous South Pole winter season.<br>
      <br>
      Shortly after that the region was shaken by an unusual earthquake.
      Seismologists located the temblor at the epicenter of the buried
      structure in East Antarctica.<br>
      <br>
      Yet still the military resisted making any comment.<br>
      <br>
      A magnetic anomaly formed, intensified, and spread to the vicinity
      of the Russian Vostok base. Russian researchers were shocked and
      puzzled.<br>
      <br>
      Meanwhile, the American military airfield buzzed with activity as
      flights came and went at a dizzying pace. Heavy machinery–some
      pretty exotic–appeared on the bleak Antarctic ice sheet.
      Unverified reports claimed that the nuclear-powered earth borer
      Subterrene arrived.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Subterrene sent to explore prehistoric machine?</b><br>
      <br>
      Finally, the American and European media were pressing hard for
      some believable answers when 9-11 occured and the US was suddenly
      under terrorist attack. Domestic and international focus
      immediately shifted from the Antarctic to New York City and
      Washington, D.C.<br>
      <br>
      The mysterious events in Antarctica were forgotten.<br>
      <br>
      <b>2002: TV crew disappears</b><br>
      <br>
      A California TV crew filming in the Antarctic went missing in
      November 2002.<br>
      <br>
      Supposedly, a video discovered among the crews’ personal effects
      by a special U.S. Navy SEAL rescue team tasked to find the
      filmmakers confirmed earlier reports of a huge artifact buried
      under the ice–a prehistoric machine that may be of alien origin.<br>
      <br>
      “The U.S. government said it will seek to block the airing of a
      video found by Navy rescuers in Antarctica that purportedly
      reveals that a massive archaeological dig is underway two miles
      beneath the ice,” stated a press release that appeared briefly on
      the studio production’s website.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Time vortex erupts</b><br>
      <br>
      As one bizarre event followed another, a research team of US and
      UK scientists accidentally came across a mind-numbing discovery.
      While working on a joint weather research project, the team
      witnessed the creation of a spinning vortex of time.<br>
      <br>
      US physicist Mariann McLein allegedly testified that she and her
      colleagues became aware of a “spinning gray fog” in the sky over
      their heads. They initially dismissed the phenomenon as merely
      part of a random polar storm.<br>
      <br>
      The spiraling vortex, however, did not disperse. Stranger still,
      despite gusts of wind and briskly moving clouds overhead, the
      weird spinning gray fog remained stationary.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Intense magnetic anomaly.</b><br>
      <br>
      Deciding to explore the odd phenomenon, the group took one of its
      weather balloons and attached a meteorological instrument to it
      that calibrated temperature, barometric pressure, humidity,
      windspeed and a scientific chronometer to record the times of the
      readings.<br>
      <br>
      After attaching a cable to the balloon, and securing the other end
      to a winch, they released it. The balloon and instrument package
      soared upwards and were immediately sucked into the gaping maw of
      the swirling vortex.<br>
      <br>
      The balloon and instruments disappeared.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Tunnel to the past</b><br>
      <br>
      After a several minutes, they decided to retrieve the balloon.
      Despite some difficulty with the winch they succeeded in bringing
      the balloon back to earth and checked the instruments. McLein
      stated that everyone was stunned by the readout on the
      chronometer. It displayed a date decades in the past: January 27,
      1965.<br>
      <br>
      McLein claimed the experiment was repeated several times with the
      same result.<br>
      <br>
      Later, she said, the entire episode was reported to military
      intelligence and passed on to the White House. Presumably the
      strange vortex phenomenon–a highly magnetic tunnel to the past–was
      code named The Time Gate by military intelligence.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Magnetic time tunnel to the past?</b><br>
      <br>
      As the phenomenon was generated in the same general vicinity as
      the discovery of the giant apparatus deep under the ice, it’s
      thought the two may be related.<br>
      <br>
      If indeed a magnetic time vortex is appearing and disappearing
      over Antarctica–and if the phenomena is not natural, but generated
      by some unknown technology deep under the icecap–it may reveal the
      physics of time and could potentially allow control of the past,
      and by implication the future.<br>
      <br>
      If true, it’s no wonder the military is so intensely interested
      and so closed-mouthed about it.<br>

            Food Deserts</b></big><br>

      <br>
      Wal-Mart's decision to shutter 154 stores across the country means
      that, starting Thursday, residents without cars in a neighborhood
      near a historically black college outside Birmingham, Alabama,
      will have to cross dangerous roadways on foot to get fresh produce
      and meat. Come Friday, folks in Coal Hill, Arkansas, will need to
      drive 15 miles to get to the nearest supermarket and pharmacy.
      Low-income neighbors of Wichita State University in Kansas, too,
      will be losing quick access to fresh groceries.<br>
      <br>
      The store closings by the world's largest retailer are creating
      three new food deserts in these neighborhoods with nearly 15,000
      residents combined, according to an Associated Press analysis.<br>
      <br>
      One of them is in Fairfield, Alabama, a hard-luck suburb of 11,000
      about 8 miles west of Birmingham. The Wal-Mart there sits on a
      highway marked by dreary swaths of abandoned commercial buildings,
      fast-food restaurants, payday lending businesses and gas stations.
      By late last week it was already out of fresh food, and shoppers
      who picked over the remaining items also worried that the store's
      shutdown could affect competitive prices nearby.<br>
      <br>
      "That gives the stores the opportunity to raise their prices
      because you don't have anywhere else to go," 66-year-old Diane
      Jones said as she loaded bags into the trunk of her older sedan.<br>
      <br>
      Besides the three new food deserts, another 31 neighborhoods in 15
      states will lack any place that sells fresh produce and meat once
      the last of the Wal-Mart stores slated for closure turns off the
      lights Feb. 5. However, poverty is not so pervasive in those
      neighborhoods that they would qualify as food deserts, as defined
      by the federal government.<br>
      <br>
      The U.S. Department of Agriculture considers a neighborhood a food
      desert if at least a fifth of residents live in poverty and a
      third live more than a mile from a supermarket in urban areas, or
      more than 10 miles in rural areas, where residents are more likely
      to have cars. Nearly 9,000 neighborhoods are considered food
      deserts by that definition, according to the USDA's most recent
      review..<br>
