          <br>
          <b>by Merkl, George, Ph.D.</b><br>
        </div>
        <br>
        George Merkl is a nuclear physicist and president of Life
        Crystal Incorporated in El Paso, Texas. He has conducted
        research for the past 30 years in his own research laboratories,
        and holds more than 40 U.S., and hundreds of international
        patents on his discoveries and inventions. Dr. Merkl is listed
        in "Who's Who Among the Pioneers in Science Today". His latest
        discovery is the present discovery particle biochemistry and the
        secret of life. He is the author of "Inner Space (Unified
        Theory)", and he has discovered a new treatment which can cure
        AIDS, cancer, and many other degenerative diseases.<br>
        <br>
        <b>LIFE CRYSTAL</b><br>
        <br>
        Before I start, I would like to explain the difference between
        Life Crystal and Chondriana. Life Crystal does not contain
        Chondriana and Life Crystal cannot induce Chondriana into your
        body although some counterfeit products indicate the contrary.
        Life Crystal is produced by extracting adenosine phosphates,
        guanosine phosphates and five carbon sugars from off the shelf
        food items. It is a material with very high purity. The F.D.A.
        in the United States approved adenosine in 1989 and adenosine
        monophosphate 20 years ago, and they know exactly what they do.
        When a patient is taken to the hospital with a coronary attack,
        this is the first thing they give them to save their lives. The
        injection contains three milligrams and it costs $3,000 per
        injection. That makes it a million dollars a gram. We have ten
        grams of adenosine in every bottle of Life Crystal drink.<br>
        <br>
        When the <b>adenosine and adenosine phosphate, guanosine and
          guanosine phosphate</b> are crystallized and dissolved in
        double distilled water, they depolarize the water. The Life
        Crystal has the same tetrahedral structure as the water, with
        matching frequencies, and therefore it can charge the water with
        enough energy to change the polarity of the water. Once it
        changes the polarity of the water, it will lose the affinity to
        hydrophilic molecules and pick up affinity towards hydrophobic
        molecules. In layman's terms, this means it can dissolve double
        carbon bonds, hydrocarbons, waxes, cholesterols, plaques and
        sugar deposits, and this enables it to clean out the blood
        vessels. Most of the time when an organ fails, it fails because
        of lack of respiration and lack of circulation. Once you clean
        out the blood vessels and re-establish circulation, the organs
        will recover.<br>
        <br>
        Life Crystal has a tetrahedral structure like a pyramid. Because
        of the shape of the tetrahedral crystal, it develops a vortex
        field around the pyramid and then the crystal will deposit
        around the pyramid in a vortex coil. This is the reason why Life
        Crystal can tap into the energy of creation. Light is made up of
        free energy, 918 pairs of scrolls which make up one photon, and
        this is the breath of creation, or the breath of God, whatever
        you want to call it. Without that, life cannot exist. We can
        break down light for the first time. The 918 pairs of photons
        then mould into one electron and 918 pairs of electrons mould
        into one neutron. That is the way free energy is moulded into
        light and light is moulded into matter. We are all made of the
        same substance. This is the reason the Life Crystal is capable
        of tapping into the life energy which is a prerequisite for
        life.<br>
        <br>
        <b>CHONDRIANA</b><br>
        <br>
        The Chondriana are human in origin. They are our precursors.
        They are micro-organisms which have been synthesized from human
        DNA. The Chondriana existed three and a half billion years ago.
        We had life forms back then that were capable of reproducing or
        mass producing all our organs. There is a micro-organism which
        has been found fossilized in western Australia dated three and a
        half billion years. It is identical to the Chondriana. Every
        organelle in our cells was at one time produced by similar
        Chondriana. In other words, we had life forms, back three and a
        half billion years ago that were capable of reproducing all our
        organs. We had factories in our cells, which we do not have
        today, which produced the organelles inside our cells.<br>
        <br>
        With a reverse procedure, we can recreate those factories in our
        cells and that is what I have done. I took the organelles inside
        our cells and recreated all the factories from which those
        organelles had originated. I was able to produce Chondriana,
        mass producing centrioles, mitochondria, Golgi apparatus and all
        the different organs, including the cell nucleus and cell
        nucleolus.<br>
        <br>
        This means we can bring back our defence system, the defence
        cells we once used to have but which we lost because the sun is
        cooling and we are losing energy. We are not going through
        evolution; we are going through devolution. Our cells are
        becoming punier and punier as time goes on. The massive carbon
        dioxide blankets we are putting up in the sky is accelerating
        the process. But now, re-introducing Life Crystal into the
        system, we can re-awaken our old immune system. We can bring
        back the old giant lymphocytes which are able to protect us.<br>
        <br>
        <b>CIRCULATORY PROBLEMS AND HEART DISEASE</b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        Many clinics are using Life Crystal for chelation. They are
        replacing E.D.T.A. with Life Crystal to clean the blood vessels
        and they are getting much better results. When someone is on
        Life Crystal, even just as a nutritional supplement taken
        orally, if they take it every day, even if their arteries are
        98% plugged, there is no need for heart surgery, and within one
        year the arteries will be cleaned. The body water will dissolve
        the cholesterol and they will urinate off the fat. Chelation may
        be done in two ways using Life Crystal. We recommend a teaspoon
        three times a day for the oral dose. The intravenous treatment
        is given at half a c.c. per week.<br>
        <br>
        <b>DIABETES</b><br>
        <br>
        Life Crystal cleans out the blood vessels and restores
        circulation. When Life Crystal is administered intravenously to
        a diabetic who needs a kidney transplant, in five weeks, the
        kidneys function normally. If diabetics are scheduled for a leg
        amputation, in five weeks, Life Crystal will dissolve the sugar
        deposits, restore respiration and nutrient flow, eliminate
        claudication, and they can go jogging. We have diabetics now
        whose eyesight has also been restored.<br>
        <br>
        <b>OTHER DISEASES</b><br>
        <br>
        We have ample clinical evidence from all over the world that
        Life Crystal helps restore health. We have had a few cases of
        Parkinson's Disease and our treatment was successful. We are
        very effective against cancer, environmental illness and all
        diseases. We get a 100% response with HIV, AIDS. We have some
        people now who have been cured from AIDS. All the lupus
        diseases, rheumatic arthritis, circulatory problems, diabetes
        and so on. When people have coronary heart attacks, they may
        administer it every day. Someone who has a serious problem such
        as kidney failure, claudications or blindness, should use the
        intravenous method because it is quicker. In five weeks it
        restores the circulation and respiration, and cleans out the
        blood vessels. Because the Chondriana are precursors of our
        origin, they are part of us. Therefore, you are not taking drugs
        or chemicals.<br>
        <br>
        <b>ACTION OF THE CHONDRIANA IN OUR SYSTEM</b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        Q: How do the Chondriana interact with pathogens and viruses? A:
        The Chondriana themselves are militant. They attack the disease
        directly. They attack it physically, consuming it. Their
        membranes are invasive, so they attack the disease, take it
        apart and recycle it. They break down the genetic material all
        the way to ribosomes and recycle them into their own sequence.
        They grow up on it. They can also produce interferon and
        interleuken II. They can stimulate the T-4 and T-8 cell
        production, or they can pick up the frequency of your immune
        cells and reproduce them. They can reproduce dozens of different
        types of macrophages, each of which has a different type of
        function. They produce oscillators of many different types,
        immune cells which break up the disease and then come and clean
        up like a vacuum cleaner. The Chondriana's mouth is like a sack.
        It is like a shutter of a camera. The neck can narrow and open
        and they use it like a vacuum cleaner. They just mop up the
        disease. Because they are super intelligent, they know the
        sequence of life. They can sequence the DNA molecule to make all
        kinds of life forms. They can make life like you make breakfast.
        They are far more intelligent than we are and they are our
        ancestors.<br>
        <br>
        Q: Are the Chondriana not rejected in the same way an organ
        implant from another person is rejected? A: The Chondriana do
        not come from another person. The Chondriana belong to everyone.
        It doesn't type to my person or any person. When the Chondriana
        are injected into your blood stream, the Chondriana's genetic
        material goes into your blood cells, blows itself up four times
        the size, and you start mass producing your own Chondriana.<br>
        <br>
        Q: Does the human system have Chondriana already? A: In
        dormancy. We used to have it, but we don't have it any more.
        Only the information on the DNA.<br>
        <br>
        Q: Is Life Crystal dependent upon Chondriana? A: No because Life
        Crystal by itself is basically rebuilding, restoring,
        rejuvenating and cleaning out the blood vessels, restoring the
        circulation, respiration and providing nutrients. Ninety-five
        percent of your energy comes from ATP, and Life Crystal is
        loaded with ATP. But you can't make Chondriana without Life
        Crystal.<br>
        <br>
        <b>MAKING OF LIFE CRYSTAL</b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        Q: What is Life Crystal and how do you make it? A: Life Crystal
        is made up of adenosine phosphate, guanosine phosphate and five
        carbon sugars. Our DNA molecules are made from it. They are the
        basic building blocks of life. We take this from plants. The
        adenosine and guanosine phosphates come from genetic material of
        plants, like lettuce, tea etc. The five carbon sugars come from
        fruit juices, organically produced, very high purity fruit
        juices. You reap off the carbon and you have five carbon sugars.
        You add a phosphate to it and you have sugar phosphate (fructose
        and glucose phosphates). These are intermediates in the process
        of a new cell making ATP.<br>
        <br>
        <b>DOSAGE OF CHONDRIANA AND LIFE CRYSTAL</b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        Q: Can you take Life Crystal and Chondriana at the same time? A:
        You can take them independently or you can take them together.
        You put Life Crystal under your tongue. Keep it in your mouth
        for a minute or two, let it absorb before swallowing it. We
        usually recommend a teaspoon. There is no shelf life limit. The
        longer you keep it, the better it is. You can keep it on the
        shelf. You don't have to refrigerate it until you open it. We
        recommend that people use Chondriana if they are sick. If they
        have a bacterial or viral disease, they use half and half: half
        Life Crystal and half Chondriana, since the Life Crystal helps
        to open up the fine blood vessels. When the Chondriana go after
        the disease and kill it, the waste and the toxins can be drained
        much faster because your fine blood vessels are open and you
        have a much lower reaction.<br>
        <br>
        <b>SAFETY OF LIFE CRYSTAL AND ITS USE IN PREGNANCY AND FOR
          INCREASING FERTILITY</b><br>
        <br>
        Q: Is Life Crystal safe to take whether you are sick or not? A:
        Absolutely. It is very safe. The youngest person to take it is
        four months old. My wife just gave birth to a baby girl and she
        was taking it all through her pregnancy. She was also on
        Chondriana treatment. It is safe to take the nutritional
        supplement, one teaspoon three times a day, not the injectable.
        It is absolutely safe. It will be very interesting to see what
        effects it had on the child. She is too young to draw blood and
        test it, but I will test her later. We have three Chondriana
        babies from different families. Two of them couldn't conceive
        previously. Once they went on Life Crystal, they conceived
        within two or three months because Life Crystal will speed up
        the proliferation of primordial cells, the sex cells, and make
        them very strong. The children are very strong and very healthy
        and all three of them are pretty close to nine pounds and were
        born at eight months, not nine months, and they turned around at
        three months. My wife and I had three other children before and
        this pregnancy was entirely different from the others.<br>
        <br>
        <b>ASTHMA AND EPILEPSY</b><br>
        <br>
        Q: We have a boy who has chronic asthma. Can he be helped with
        Life Crystal? A: We have a lot of little boys who are just on
        Life Crystal drink alone whose asthma is disappearing. We have a
        lot of children in countries where their mothers were exposed to
        harmful chemicals or insecticides when they were pregnant. All
        these children were born with epilepsy and seizures. They had
        200 to 400 seizures a month, and some had 10 seizures a day.
        They went on Life Crystal drink alone, nothing else, and within
        two months they were normal.<br>
        <br>
        <b>CANDIDA AND EPSTEIN BARR SYNDROME</b><br>
        <br>
        Q: Is Life Crystal effective for Candida? A: Candida occurs most
        of the time in association with Epstein Barr syndrome. It is a
        major epidemic in English speaking countries. United States have
        60 million Epstein Barr cases and only five percent of the
        population know that they have it. It spreads from passing
        around the bottle. You are spreading it by saliva, drinking or
        eating after someone else. It stays dormant for 15 years, but
        once it breaks out and gets into the active state, you start
        developing the Candidas. Candida eats away your glucose and
        deprives you of ATP, because ATP is made from glucose. Your
        organ cells degenerate, and as a result the disease moves in,
        and the immune cells degenerate, so more disease moves in. Your
        immune cells are not capable of defending you. If you supplement
        ATP, you can freeze the disease, sort of put it on the shelf,
        because you keep your organ cells and your immune cells happy.
        Then you can lead a normal life and you eliminate your chronic
        fatigue. Chronic fatigue occurs because your cells are starved.
        They don't have ATP. Ninety-five percent of energy comes from
        ATP. If you want to get rid of the disease, you have to go
        through Chondriana treatment, 30 injections, which give very
        strong reactions, but you can get rid of the virus. Epstein Barr
        is called the cousin of AIDS. AIDS destroys the immune cells
        directly. In Epstein Barr and Candida, the immune cells are
        starved by deprivation of ATP.<br>
        <br>
        Q: How do you know how many injections to use for the Epstein
        Barr virus? A: In order to determine the number of injections to
        use, we do blood tests. We look for the immunoglobulins. The
        level should be below 20. The more advanced your Epstein Barr
        is, the higher the level is. If someone had 600, they have
        probably had Epstein Barr for about 25 years. If they had 1400,
        they may have had Epstein Barr for 35 years. Those are the final
        stages. In the final stages, Epstein Barr attacks the brain and
        the organs and destroys the organs; people cannot function any
        more.<br>

        <b>HEAVY METAL TOXICITY</b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        Q: Is Life Crystal effective against heavy metal toxicity
        including mercury? A: Yes. It is being used as a chelation
        agent. The Life Crystal is a very effective chelating agent but
        not necessarily for the removal of mercury.<br>
        <br>
        <b>LUPUS</b><br>
        <br>
        Q: Have you had any success with lupus? A: We have very exciting
        results with lupus. We have lupus A, B, C and D. The lupus A
        attacks basically joints. Lupus B and C attack organs and lupus
        D attacks the brain. It usually takes about five or six
        injections to be on the safe side, 10 injections for sure gets
        rid of lupus of any kind, either A, B, C or D. Lupus also occurs
        together with hepatitis, because if you have B and C, they also
        attack your organs including the spleen, liver, kidney and bring
        in hepatitis. So in one sweep we can get rid of all the
        problems.<br>
        <br>
        <b>AGING</b><br>
        <br>
        Q: Can Life Crystal be used for rejuvenation? A: We can
        reproduce primordial cells which can be turned into new young
        cells in order to reverse your ageing. You can restore your
        body, your organs and your tissues, and not only slow down, but
        actually reverse ageing.<br>
        <br>
        <b>BALDNESS</b><br>
        <br>
        Q: Can Life Crystal be used for thinning hair and baldness? A:
        Well, look at my hair. Sixty percent of my hair is new and
        whatever I had before was completely white. It grew in about a
        year and a half. You can use it topically.<br>

          <i>Introducing the first safe and sustainable battery</i><i><br>
          </i></div>
        <br>
        Our technology is based on a simple idea: In order to meet the
        challenges of the world’s growing energy needs and increase the
        use of renewable power, we need large-scale energy storage
        systems that are high performance, safe, sustainable and
        cost-effective. Our founder, Professor Jay Whitacre, set out to
        solve this problem and discovered a simple and elegant solution
        that is a twist on a 200 year-old technology: saltwater
        batteries.<br>
        <br>
        Aquion developed this solution into our patented Aqueous Hybrid
        Ion (AHI™) chemistry. Aquion’s Aspen batteries are sealed
        electrochemical energy storage systems based on our unique
        saltwater electrolyte. Unlike flow batteries, lithium ion
        batteries, and lead acid batteries, our Aspen batteries are made
        using abundant, nontoxic materials and modern low cost
        manufacturing techniques.&nbsp; Our saltwater batteries are
        maintenance-free and optimized for daily deep cycling.<br>
        A unique chemistry.<br>
        <br>
        Our unique Aqueous Hybrid Ion (AHI) chemistry is composed of a
        saltwater electrolyte, manganese oxide cathode, carbon titanium
        phosphate composite anode, and synthetic cotton separator. The
        battery utilizes non-corrosive intercalation reactions at the
        anode and cathode.<br>
        Aqueous Hybrid Ion (AHI) Chemistry<br>
        &nbsp; <br>
        <b>What’s inside matters.</b><br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aquion’s batteries are not flammable,
        corrosive, or explosive under any conditions, states of charge,
        or use conditions (with the exception of a severe overcharge
        leading to gas evolution, a situation that is not possible
        during transport).<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AHI batteries have a safe water-based
        electrolyte, as compared to the flammable organic solvent in
        lithium ion batteries and caustic sulfuric acid in lead acid
        batteries.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This water-based system moderates the maximum
        temperature that the battery can reach – it is impossible for
        any internal reactions to drive the battery above 100°C, since
        at this temperature, all of the water will evaporate leading to
        an open circuit condition.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thermal runaway events are simply not
        possible in the AHI chemistry for the reasons described above as
        well as the fact that lithium metal, dendrites, and SEI layers
        cannot form because they are all water soluble species and
        cannot build on the electrode surface and lead to short
        circuits.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AHI batteries have an
        environmentally-friendly electrochemical design that contains no
        heavy metals, toxic chemicals, inorganic solvents, or other
        noxious materials.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AHI batteries rely on no heavy or toxic
        metals, such as lead, or caustic materials such as sulfuric acid
        or lithium hexafluorophosphate.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AHI batteries are safe enough to be disposed
        via traditional waste streams (always follow local regulations
        regarding disposal of any product).<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The batteries are completely sealed and do
        not require maintenance. They are self-balancing and therefore
        do not require an equalizing charge or a battery management
        system (BMS).<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AHI batteries have no moving parts like flow
        batteries, complicated watering systems like some lead acid
        batteries, and do not require active cell balancing like lithium
        ion systems.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The aqueous electrolyte provides natural
        overcharge and overdischarge protection and, along with the high
        impedance of the system, allows AHI batteries to self balance in
        string configurations.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Resilient high-performing</b><br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AHI batteries are tolerant to daily deep
        cycling, wide temperature ranges, and partial state of charge
        cycling with minimal degradation.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to the safety and sustainability
        advantages of using water as electrolyte, another advantage is
        the thermal mass of the embodied water means that AHI products
        neither heat nor cool rapidly. As such, the products can operate
        in a very wide operating temperature window because they simply
        take so long to heat and to cool.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The AHI chemistry relies on charge/discharge
        mechanisms which are unaffected by partial state of charge –
        these batteries can sit indefinitely at partial, or even no
        state of charge, without irreversible capacity loss like lead
        acid batteries.<br>

        <br>
        A team of researchers at MIT has designed one of the strongest
        lightweight materials known, by compressing and fusing flakes of
        graphene, a two-dimensional form of carbon. The new material, a
        sponge-like configuration with a density of just 5 percent, can
        have a strength 10 times that of steel.<br>
        <br>
        In its two-dimensional form, graphene is thought to be the
        strongest of all known materials. But researchers until now have
        had a hard time translating that two-dimensional strength into
        useful three-dimensional materials.<br>
        <br>
        The new findings show that the crucial aspect of the new 3-D
        forms has more to do with their unusual geometrical
        configuration than with the material itself, which suggests that
        similar strong, lightweight materials could be made from a
        variety of materials by creating similar geometric features.<br>
        <br>
        The findings are being reported today in the journal Science
        Advances, in a paper by Markus Buehler, the head of MIT’s
        Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering (CEE) and the
        McAfee Professor of Engineering; Zhao Qin, a CEE research
        scientist; Gang Seob Jung, a graduate student; and Min Jeong
        Kang MEng ’16, a recent graduate.<br>
        <br>
        A team of MIT engineers has successfully designed a new 3-D
        material with five percent the density of steel and ten times
        the strength, making it one of the strongest lightweight
        materials known.<br>
        <br>
        Other groups had suggested the possibility of such lightweight
        structures, but lab experiments so far had failed to match
        predictions, with some results exhibiting several orders of
        magnitude less strength than expected. The MIT team decided to
        solve the mystery by analyzing the material’s behavior down to
        the level of individual atoms within the structure. They were
        able to produce a mathematical framework that very closely
        matches experimental observations.<br>
        <br>
        Two-dimensional materials — basically flat sheets that are just
        one atom in thickness but can be indefinitely large in the other
        dimensions — have exceptional strength as well as unique
        electrical properties. But because of their extraordinary
        thinness, “they are not very useful for making 3-D materials
        that could be used in vehicles, buildings, or devices,” Buehler
        says. “What we’ve done is to realize the wish of translating
        these 2-D materials into three-dimensional structures.”<br>
        <br>
        The team was able to compress small flakes of graphene using a
        combination of heat and pressure. This process produced a
        strong, stable structure whose form resembles that of some
        corals and microscopic creatures called diatoms. These shapes,
        which have an enormous surface area in proportion to their
        volume, proved to be remarkably strong. “Once we created these
        3-D structures, we wanted to see what’s the limit — what’s the
        strongest possible material we can produce,” says Qin. To do
        that, they created a variety of 3-D models and then subjected
        them to various tests. In computational simulations, which mimic
        the loading conditions in the tensile and compression tests
        performed in a tensile loading machine, “one of our samples has
        5 percent the density of steel, but 10 times the strength,” Qin
        says.<br>
        <br>
        Buehler says that what happens to their 3-D graphene material,
        which is composed of curved surfaces under deformation,
        resembles what would happen with sheets of paper. Paper has
        little strength along its length and width, and can be easily
        crumpled up. But when made into certain shapes, for example
        rolled into a tube, suddenly the strength along the length of
        the tube is much greater and can support substantial weight.
        Similarly, the geometric arrangement of the graphene flakes
        after treatment naturally forms a very strong configuration.<br>
        <br>
        The new configurations have been made in the lab using a
        high-resolution, multimaterial 3-D printer. They were
        mechanically tested for their tensile and compressive
        properties, and their mechanical response under loading was
        simulated using the team’s theoretical models. The results from
        the experiments and simulations matched accurately.<br>
        <br>
        The new, more accurate results, based on atomistic computational
        modeling by the MIT team, ruled out a possibility proposed
        previously by other teams: that it might be possible to make 3-D
        graphene structures so lightweight that they would actually be
        lighter than air, and could be used as a durable replacement for
        helium in balloons. The current work shows, however, that at
        such low densities, the material would not have sufficient
        strength and would collapse from the surrounding air pressure.<br>
        <br>
        But many other possible applications of the material could
        eventually be feasible, the researchers say, for uses that
        require a combination of extreme strength and light weight. “You
        could either use the real graphene material or use the geometry
        we discovered with other materials, like polymers or metals,”
        Buehler says, to gain similar advantages of strength combined
        with advantages in cost, processing methods, or other material
        properties (such as transparency or electrical conductivity).<br>
        <br>
        “You can replace the material itself with anything,” Buehler
        says. “The geometry is the dominant factor. It’s something that
        has the potential to transfer to many things.”<br>
        <br>
        The unusual geometric shapes that graphene naturally forms under
        heat and pressure look something like a Nerf ball — round, but
        full of holes. These shapes, known as gyroids, are so complex
        that “actually making them using conventional manufacturing
        methods is probably impossible,” Buehler says. The team used
        3-D-printed models of the structure, enlarged to thousands of
        times their natural size, for testing purposes.<br>
        <br>
        For actual synthesis, the researchers say, one possibility is to
        use the polymer or metal particles as templates, coat them with
        graphene by chemical vapor deposit before heat and pressure
        treatments, and then chemically or physically remove the polymer
        or metal phases to leave 3-D graphene in the gyroid form. For
        this, the computational model given in the current study
        provides a guideline to evaluate the mechanical quality of the
        synthesis output.<br>
        <br>
        The same geometry could even be applied to large-scale
        structural materials, they suggest. For example, concrete for a
        structure such as a bridge might be made with this porous
        geometry, providing comparable strength with a fraction of the
        weight. This approach would have the additional benefit of
        providing good insulation because of the large amount of
        enclosed airspace within it.<br>
        <br>
        Because the shape is riddled with very tiny pore spaces, the
        material might also find application in some filtration systems,
        for either water or chemical processing. The mathematical
        descriptions derived by this group could facilitate the
        development of a variety of applications, the researchers say.<br>
        <br>
        “This is an inspiring study on the mechanics of 3-D graphene
        assembly,” says Huajian Gao, a professor of engineering at Brown
        University, who was not involved in this work. “The combination
        of computational modeling with 3-D-printing-based experiments
        used in this paper is a powerful new approach in engineering
        research. It is impressive to see the scaling laws initially
        derived from nanoscale simulations resurface in macroscale
        experiments under the help of 3-D printing,” he says.<br>
        <br>
        This work, Gao says, “shows a promising direction of bringing
        the strength of 2-D materials and the power of material
        architecture design together.”<br>
        <br>
        The research was supported by the Office of Naval Research, the
        Department of Defense Multidisciplinary University Research
        Initiative, and BASF-North American Center for Research on
        Advanced Materials.<br>

        Having grown up during the second half of the 20th century, I
        don’t recognize my country today. I experienced life in a
        competent country, and now I experience life in an incompetent
        country.<br>
        <br>
        Everything is incompetent. The police are incompetent. They
        shoot children, grandmothers, cripples, and claim that they
        feared for their life.<br>
        <br>
        Washington’s foreign police is incompetent. Washington has
        alienated the world with its insane illegal attacks on other
        countries. Today the United States and Israel are the two most
        distrusted countries on earth and the two countries regarded as
        the greatest threat to peace.<br>
        <br>
        The military/security complex is incompetent. The national
        security state is so incompetent that it was unable to block the
        most humiliating attack in history against a superpower that
        proved to be entirely helpless as a few people armed with box
        cutters and an inability to fly an airplane destroyed the World
        Trade Center and part of the Pentagon itself. The military
        industries have produced at gigantic cost the F-35 that is no
        match for the Russian fighters or even for the F-15s and F-16s
        it is supposed to replace.<br>
        <br>
        The media is incompetent. I can’t think of an accurate story
        that has been reported in the 21st century. There must be one,
        but it doesn’t come to mind.<br>
        <br>
        The universities are incompetent. Instead of hiring professors
        to teach the students, the universities hire administrators to
        regulate them. Instead of professors, there are presidents, vice
        presidents, chancellors, vice chancellors, provosts, vice
        provosts, assistant provosts, deans, associate deans, assistant
        deans. Instead of subject matter there is speech regulation and
        sensitivity training. Universities spend up to 75% of their
        budgets on administrators, many of whom have outsized incomes.<br>
        <br>
        The public schools have been made incompetent by standardized
        national testing. The purpose of education today is to pass some
        test. School accreditation and teachers’ pay depend not on
        developing the creativity or independent thinking of those
        students capable of it, but on herding them through memory work
        for a standardized test.<br>
        <br>
        One could go on endlessly.<br>
        <br>
        Instead, I will relate a story of everyday incompetences that
        have prevented me from writing this week and for a few more days
        yet.<br>
        <br>
        Recently, while away from my home, a heavy equipment operator
        working on a nearby construction site managed to drive under
        power lines with the fork lift raised. Instead of breaking the
        wire, it snapped the pole in half that conveyed electric power
        to my house. The power company came out, or, as I suspect, an
        outsourced contractor, who reestablished power to my home but
        did not check that the neutral wire was still attached.<br>
        <br>
        Consequently for a week or so my house experienced round the
        clock surges of high voltage that blew out the surge protection,
        breaker box, and every appliance in the house. Expecting my
        return, the house was inspected, and the discovery was that
        there was no power. Back came the power company and discovered
        that high voltage was feeding into the house and had destroyed
        everything plugged in.<br>
        <br>
        So. Here we have a moron operating heavy equipment who does not
        understand that he cannot drive under power lines with the lift
        raised. We have a power company or its outsourced contractor who
        does not understand that power cannot be reconnected without
        making certain that the neutral wire is still connected.<br>
        <br>
        So every appliance is fried. Glass everywhere from blown out
        light bulbs. We are talking thousands of dollars.<br>
        <br>
        This is America today. And the incompetents ruling incompetents
        want war with Iran, Korea, Russia, China. Considering the
        extraordinary level of incompetence throughout the United
        States, I guarantee you that we will not win these wars.<br>

        Abstract: By assigning the elementary Planck units to the units
        of Newton?s Gravitational Constant (G), it resulted in G being a
        function of vacuum (zero point) energy (ZPE). ZPE appears to
        reduce gravity, as it is inversely proportional to gravitational
        force. Further, the value of ZPE density-matter equivalent has
        resulted to be equivalent to the Planck mass in a Planck volume,
        rendering a much easier way of calculation.<br>

        <br>
        A man had coconut oil 2 times every day for 2 months and his
        brain changed!<br>
        <br>
        The worst disease in the world is Alzheimer, but this can be
        avoided and memory can be renewed again. Trust us! Here is the
        story of Mary T. Newport, pediatrist who dealt with her
        husband’s illness in the 50s.<br>
        <br>
        Steve her husband, had dementia for 5 years. Then he got MRI and
        he got diagnosis of Alzheimer. This was found at a bad stage.<br>
        <br>
        He was dizzy, confused and had no focus. He did not even work
        with cutlery, spoons and forks and could not even find food in
        the fridge. He forgot messages he received and remembered many
        days later.<br>
        <br>
        His frontal and parietal lobes and hippocampus too and amygdala
        were atrophied a lot. The short term memory was all gone and he
        made up new info in his brain later in those days. His wife made
        radical changes to his diet then.<br>
        <br>
        He got many meds and drugs by the doctors but they did not help.
        He was skinny and had depression. The motions were limited and
        he had tremors too. His wife then looked for options in&nbsp;
        the diet for changes.<br>
        <br>
        This drug was Ketasyn AC 1202 and stopped Alzheimer stages
        progress in just 3 months. The wife examined this and saw the
        main item in it- triglyceride oil. And this means coconut oil of
        the health store.<br>
        <br>
        She gave her husband coconut 2 spoons daily in 2 times, for 2
        months. After a year, he got better, recognized faces and spoke
        normally. He walked in nature and walked on streets again. It
        improved daily.<br>
        <br>
        She swears by this coconut oil for this problem.<br>
        <br>
        HOW IS COCONUT GOOD FOR THIS?<br>
        <br>
        The brain needs food above all and 60% of glucose goes to the
        brain.<br>
        But, the brain does not use up all glucose cells and this is due
        to hypermetabolism and bad cognition. The ketone byproducts of
        fat working up is good for the brain. The feed neurons and
        nerves due to some brain damage.<br>
        <br>
        Some neurons do not use up the glucose and are resistant to
        insulin. Ketones save these cells.<br>
        <br>
        Ketones are seen after starvation and also in MCT when they get
        exposed to oxygen with the liver together and make even more
        ketones. 97% of fats we eat are long chain triglycerides and
        contain 18 carbons. Medium chain is 6-12 carbons.<br>
        <br>
        For the Parkinson’s coconut is also goo, and for drug related
        epilepsy, diabetes and multiple sclerosis.is coconut oil good
        for you<br>
        <br>
        FOR MORE EVIDENCE…<br>
        <br>
        In a 2004 study of Neurobiology of Aging said coconut oil
        improves cognition and memory. Here were tested and monitored 20
        people as they got placebos and coconut too. After 90 minutes,
        the coconut showed better results with more beta-hydroxybutrate
        beta OHB , the strongest ketone.<br>
        <br>
        They fasted and starved before this test and blood check up.
        After 90 min, coconut improved cognition and the dose was just
        40 ml.<br>
        <br>
        Mercola stated that Dr. David Perlmutter a neurologist, claimed
        to avoid fat and carbs during Alzheimer’s.<br>
        <br>
        Both agreed that fasting is good when mixed with coconut and
        this made more glycogen in the liver. Also this removed extra
        fat and you get in keto stage easy. This means healthy weight
        loss and healthy brain, but there is a catch. If ketones get too
        high, blood acidity is higher and you enter ketoacidosis which
        is fatal. Eliminate sugars and gluten and have a healthier gut
        too.<br>

        <br>
        In a new study, MIT researchers have developed nanoparticles
        that can deliver the CRISPR genome-editing system and
        specifically modify genes in mice. The team used nanoparticles
        to carry the CRISPR components, eliminating the need to use
        viruses for delivery.<br>
        <br>
        Using the new delivery technique, the researchers were able to
        cut out certain genes in about 80 percent of liver cells, the
        best success rate ever achieved with CRISPR in adult animals.<br>
        <br>
        "What's really exciting here is that we've shown you can make a
        nanoparticle that can be used to permanently and specifically
        edit the DNA in the liver of an adult animal," says Daniel
        Anderson, an associate professor in MIT's Department of Chemical
        Engineering and a member of MIT's Koch Institute for Integrative

        The tubes are bundled into fuel assemblies similar to those in a
        conventional PWR. These are held in the support structure which
        forms the reactor modules. <br>
        <br>
        The tank is filled with a safe molten salt coolant, which is not
        pressurised like gas or water coolants in today’s power reactors
        and not violently reactive with air and water like sodium in
        today’s Fast Breeder reactors. A second similar coolant salt
        system takes heat from the primary coolant salt to steam
        generators kept well away from the reactor.<br>
        <br>
        Refuelling is simple: Fuel assemblies are simply moved sideways
        out of the core and replaced with fresh fuel assemblies. This
        results in a near on-line refuelling process.<br>
        <br>
        The entire construction is simple, with no high pressure
        systems, few moving parts, and no Pressure Vessel needing
        specialist foundries.<br>
        <br>
        The reactor is continuously cooled by natural air flow, giving
        complete security against overheating in an accident situation<br>
        <b><br>
        </b>Stable Salt Reactors are modular in construction. Their
        rectangular cores can be extended module by module to create
        reactors from 150MW to 1500MW power.<br>
        <br>
        Many versions of Stable Salt Reactors are possible. The first
        being developed now is a "waste burner". This uses fuel produced
        by a new, low cost and very simple process from spent
        conventional reactor fuel. Reduction in the radioactive life of
        that spent fuel from hundreds of thousands of years to just a
        few hundred years will effectively clean up a large part of the
        hazardous residue of the first nuclear era. Second generation
        Stable Salt Reactors will be able to breed new nuclear fuel from
        depleted uranium and thorium.<b><br>

          Lead coolant <br>
        </b><br>
        The use of lead as coolant for a nuclear reactor results in a so
        called "fast" neutron spectrum, which facilitates production of
        fissile fuel from U-238 with a conversion ratio larger than
        unity. Hence, fuel resources increase by two orders of
        magnitude, making nuclear power sustainable for thousands of
        years. Moreover, the fast neutron spectrum makes it possible to
        efficiently transmute the long-lived waste, such as americium
        and curium, into stable or short-lived fission products, with a
        minimum of negative side-effects on the safety of reactor and
        fuel-cycle facilities.<br>
        <br>
        The most important advantage of lead is that it allows to
        combine a closure of the fuel cycle with an outstanding set of
        safety features, including:<br>
        <br>
        No violent exothermic reaction with water<br>
        A very high boiling temperature, reducing the risk for loss of
        coolant<br>
        An excellent potential for decay heat removal by natural
        convection<br>
        Chemical retention of iodine and caesium, should a fuel failure
        occur<br>
        Inherent shielding of gamma radiation from fission products<b><br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          Break-through innovation<br>
          <br>
        </b>A major disadvantage of using lead coolants is the risk for
        corrosion attack on fuel cladding and steam generator tubes. The
        high solubility of nickel in lead makes it necessary to form and
        maintain a protective oxide film on the surfaces of structural
        materials. However, chromium oxide scales forming on
        conventional stainless steels grow too thick after a year of
        full power operation in a lead-cooled reactor, making them
        mechanically unstable. Silicon or aluminium alloyed steels form
        thinner films of silicon and aluminium oxides, respectively,
        rendering the steels corrosion proof over longer exposure times.
        In Russia, a silicon alloyed steel has been developed for use in
        the SVBR-100 and BEST-300 reactors, whereas in Germany, a
        technique for surface alloying of steels with FeCrAlY has
        allowed to improve corrosion and fretting performance
        significantly.<br>
        <br>
        In collaboration with Swedish steel industry, LeadCold materials
        experts have developed an aluminium alloyed steel
        (Fe-10Cr-4Al-Zr) which exhibits perfect corrosion resistance
        during exposure to lead for more than 19 000 hours at T = 550°C.
        The addition of zirconium reduces the risk for formation of
        chromium carbides that may be detrimental for corrosion
        resistance, and allows to keep the aluminium concentration at a
        level low enough to ensure weldability of the material. Based on
        this break-through innovation, LeadCold has designed the SEALER
        reactor for commercial power production in off-grid
        applications. <b><br>

            <br>
          </b></div>
        <b> </b>Terrestrial Energy’s Integral Molten Salt Reactor
        (IMSR®) is designed to meet the rapidly rising demand for
        breakthrough energy technologies that can deliver clean,
        scalable, and cost-competitive heat and power to displace
        fossil-fuel combustion starting in the 2020s. The IMSR® is a
        fundamentally different reactor. It employs advanced molten-salt
        technology, which creates a far superior system to harness clean
        bountiful energy of the atom simply, safely and economically.<b><br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;Low Cost <br>
          <br>
        </b>Using advanced molten salt reactor technology, IMSR® power
        plants are simpler than the Conventional Reactor power plants in
        the market today, which are pressurized-water reactors. IMSR®
        power plants are smaller, and with modular design and
        construction, can be built within 4 years and financed by
        ordinary means. IMSR® power plants will be cost-competitive with
        fossil fuels even in the absence of CO2 emission penalties...<b><br>
          <br>
          How it Works<br>
          <br>
        </b>The fundamental engineering challenge of nuclear
        fission-reactor design is the safe dissipation of fission heat
        in every conceivable set of circumstances. The fundamental
        economic problem with solid-fuel reactors, which have been used
        for the past 60 years, is that a solid-fuel solution to this
        central challenge leads to a nuclear plant that is too complex
        and too challenging to finance and build. It is time to revisit
        this fundamental challenge of heat dissipation with different
        technology choices and with 21st century energy-market needs in
        mind.<br>
        <br>
        The IMSR® is a liquid-fuel reactor system, rather than a
        solid-fuel system, as is used exclusively in conventional
        reactors. The IMSR® dissipates heat using a molten salt. Salts
        are thermally stable and excellent heat-transfer fluids, ideal
        for dissipating heat from the fission process simply and safely.
        In a molten salt reactor (MSR), salt provides a fluid medium to
        carry a nuclear fuel—in the case of the IMSR®, a
        low-enriched-uranium fluoride salt. The IMSR® provides simple,
        safe, and natural mechanisms for heat dissipation. It is a far
        superior system for the simple passive dissipation of fission
        heat. The use of a molten salt is at the heart of many
        engineering and commercial virtues of the IMSR®.<br>
        <br>
        An IMSR® power plant generates 400 MWth of thermal energy (190
        MWe) with a thermal -spectrum, graphite-moderated,
        molten-fluoride-salt reactor system, fueled by low-enriched
        uranium (less than 5% 235U). It incorporates the approach to MSR
        design and operation researched, demonstrated and proven by the
        ARE and MSRE test reactors at Oak Ridge National Laboratory
        (ORNL); these were further developed under the DMSR program.<br>
        <br>
        The IMSR® improves upon the earlier ORNL MSR designs through
        various innovations that are pragmatic and commercial. The key
        challenge to MSR commercialization is graphite’s limited
        lifetime in a reactor core, which is a function of reactor
        power. Commercial power reactors require high core energy
        densities to be economical, but high power densities
        significantly reduce the lifetime of the graphite moderator
        requiring its replacement; this is challenging to do simply,
        safely and economically in an industrial environment. The key
        IMSR® innovation is an elegant solution to this challenge – the
        integration of the primary reactor components, including the
        graphite moderator, into a sealed and replaceable reactor core,
        the IMSR® Core-unit, which has an operating lifetime of 7 years.
        The IMSR® Core-unit is simple and safe to replace, it supports
        high utility factors for IMSR® power plants and high capital
        efficiency. It also ensures that the materials’ lifetime
        requirements of all other reactor core components are met; the
        challenge of achieving these requirements is often cited as an
        impediment to immediate commercialization of MSRs. The result is
        a power plant that delivers the combination of high energy
        output, simplicity and ease of operation, and
        cost-competitiveness essential for widespread commercial
        deployment. IMSR® power plants are a new clean energy
        alternative...<br>

          SCIENCE<br>
          <br>
        </b>The question of whether the phenomenon known as ‘cold
        fusion’ has been proven has captivated scientists ever since
        claims made by Martin Fleischmann and Stanley Pons at the
        University of Utah in 1989. Their observation of heat effects in
        electro-chemically driven palladium–deuterium experiments were
        consistent with nuclear but not chemical or stored energy
        sources. The importance of their discovery cannot be understated
        when the need for energy innovation has never been greater.<br>
        <br>
        A growing number of scientists and engineers worldwide today
        have worked on various approaches to achieving heat effects that
        are consistent with low energy nuclear reactions (LENR). Most
        however, have not been able to achieve the combination of
        reproducibility, controllability, continuity of operation,
        integrity of the materials involved and net energy output that
        Brillouin has achieved.<br>
        <br>
        Brillouin Energy’s Q-Pulse™ can stimulate a Controlled Electron
        Capture Reaction (CECR) to create a safe, controllable, and
        continuous thermal energy source, leading to the potential
        unattended operation of low and high temperature boiler system
        devices capable of producing an inexhaustible supply of safe,
        reliable clean energy. The CECR reaction consumes hydrogen in a
        solid nickel reactor core producing a large amount of heat and a
        negligible amount of harmless helium. The amount of hydrogen
        used in BEC’s reactor is very small, relative to the final heat
        output, and for all practical purposes, the supply is
        inexhaustible.<b><br>
          <br>
          TECHNOLOGY<br>
          <br>
        </b>Brillouin Energy’s technology is based on Low Energy Nuclear
        Reactions (“LENR”), which it generates in its uniquely designed
        reactor core unit that converts ordinary hydrogen into helium
        through a sequence of continuous and controlled nuclear
        reactions. The mass of helium is slightly less than the mass of
        the four hydrogen nuclei that are consumed; that mass difference
        is converted into a relatively large amount of thermal energy in
        accordance with Einstein’s famous formula: E = mc2.<br>
        <br>
        In essence, hydrogen is the “fuel” for the reactions and no
        hydrocarbon energy sources are required for continuous operation
        of the system.<br>
        <br>
        Brillouin Energy has developed and engineered two prototype
        reactor systems:<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A low temperature system operating at up to
        150ºC based on an electrolytic (wet) process. Brillouin Energy’s
        WET™ Boiler systems can supply low temperature thermal energy
        for space and water heating, and other common low temperature
        industrial purposes such as for food processing or healthcare
        applications.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A high temperature system operating at 500ºC
        to 700ºC based on applying high-pressure hydrogen gas to the
        core. Brillouin Energy’s HYDROGEN HOT TUBE (HHT™) Boiler systems
        can supply high temperature process heat and can also be used to
        generate electricity in much the same way as fossil or nuclear
        fuels generate electricity.<b><br>

        </b>Apparatus for recovering energy from water is disclosed.
        Water is heated by application of electrical energy to heaters
        and contacting the water with the heaters in a manner and under
        pressure and temperature conditions such that it is
        instantaneously converted to gas. Energy in excess of that
        supplied to the heaters results from the rapid conversion of
        water to gas.<br>
        <br>
        The present disclosure relates to power generation devices. More
        particularly, the disclosure relates to power generation device
        that supply electrical energy to heaters to heat liquid water in
        a manner that substantially instantaneously changes the water
        from a liquid state to a gaseous state, which releases more
        energy than required by the heaters...<br>

              Dentistry Known to Date</b></font><br>
        </div>
        <b><br>
        </b>Researchers have discovered the world's most ancient dental
        fillings in northern Italy. The fillings were spotted inside a
        pair of 13,000-year-old front teeth and they were made of
        bitumen, a semi-solid form of petroleum. This is the earliest
        example of dentistry known to date.<br>
        <b><br>
          Each Tooth Has a Large Hole<br>
          <br>
        </b>The newly-discovered teeth, two upper central incisors
        appear to belong to the same person and were found at the Riparo
        Fredian site near Lucca in northern Italy. The results of the
        research were published in the American Journal of Physical
        Anthropology , and show that each tooth has a large hole in the
        incisor surface that extends down into the pulp chamber deep in
        the tooth. “It is quite unusual, not something you see in normal
        teeth,” Stephano Benazzi told New Scientist , an archaeologist
        at the University of Bologna. These holes have tiny horizontal
        marks that suggest they were drilled out and it appears that
        bitumen or bitumen was added to the cavity at the same time as
        the drilling. Researchers also found plant fibers and hair
        trapped in the bitumen, which may have been part of the filling
        material.<br>

        molar teeth found at a Neolithic graveyard in Mehrgarh, Pakistan<b><br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          Usage of Fillings Similar to Today<br>
          <br>
        </b>According to Benazzi, the fillings most likely served the
        same purpose they do today: to reduce pain and keep food out of
        the cavities. Archaeologists estimate the bitumen and plant
        matter filler was chosen for its antiseptic qualities; used to
        prevent infection.<br>
        <br>
        Claudio Tuniz, an archaeologist at the University of Wollongong
        in Australia, says that bitumen, as well as some medicinal
        plants, were possibly used as an antiseptic, just like beeswax
        was used in other examples of prehistoric dentistry thousands of
        years later.<br>

        Tuniz claims that these teeth highlight that humans had achieved
        healing dental practices thousands of years before we developed
        the systematic production of foods such as cereals and honey,
        which are believed to have been accountable for an impressive
        growth in dental issues like cavities.<br>
        <br>
        According to Benazzi, during the Upper Paleolithic, when the
        owner of the newly found teeth was alive, Europe was
        experiencing immense cultural changes, as new people kept coming
        to the continent from the near East. He speculates that they
        probably brought with them new kinds of food as well, which led
        to more cavities, “This change in diet and cavities could have
        led to dentistry,” he tells New Scientist .<br>
        <br>
        Ultimately, Benazzi stated that judging by the amount of wear,
        the owner of the teeth was not very young, even though he can’t
        make any solid conclusions with the only samples being two
        teeth. <br>
        Other ancient fillings<br>
        <br>
        Until now, The&nbsp; oldest evidence of a dental filling&nbsp;
        was the discovery in 2012 in Slovenia when a 6,500-year-old
        jawbone demonstrated that a cavity deep enough to impact the
        dentin layer of the tooth had been packed with beeswax.
        Scientists aren’t sure how effective this was, but it probably
        reduced the pain and swelling.<br>
        <br>
        The ancient Egyptians are also known to have used a special
        concoction to treat cavities. The Edwin Smith Papyrus, written
        in the 17th century BC but which may reflect previous
        manuscripts from as early as 3000 BC, includes the treatment of
        several dental ailments, and the Ebers Papyrus, dating to the
        16th century BC, contains eleven recipes which pertain to oral
        issues. Four of these are remedies for loose teeth: the tooth in
        question is filled with a mixture that is akin to a modern day
        composite filling: a filler agent (ground barley) is mixed with
        a liquid matrix (honey) and an antiseptic agent (yellow ochre).
        This is either used as an actual filling, or as a splint to keep
        the tooth in place. Scientists performing CT scans on the head
        of a 2,100-year-old Egyptian mummy also found evidence for
        cavities being filled with linen, which may have first been
        dipped in a medicine such as fig juice or cedar oil.<br>
        <br>
        The study of ancient remains from around the world has
        demonstrated the ingenuity that existed in the application of
        surgical and cosmetic dental practices going back many
        millennia. <b><br>

        In something along the lines of an early warning, researchers at
        the Seattle-based University of Washington claim that they can
        hack into a computer with a small strand of DNA.<br>
        <br>
        The experts presented their findings about a potential DNA
        malware infection experiment at last week’s 26th USENIX Security
        Symposium in Vancouver.<br>
        <br>
        The Daily Mail summarized the results of this malware
        vulnerability demonstration.<br>
        <br>
        Scientists have synthesized a strand of DNA that can be used to
        hack computers in a world first. The malware was encoded into a
        gene and used to take over a computer that analyses DNA code.
        Scientists warn that cyber criminals could one day use faked
        spit or blood samples to steal information from police forensics
        labs, hack into university computers, or infect genome files
        shared by researchers.<br>
        <br>
        In a paper published for the symposium, the authors underscore
        that significant expansion in DNA sequencing technology could
        have security implications:<br>
        <br>
        To our knowledge, ours is the first effort to broadly consider
        this [DNA processing] pipeline, and the first to demonstrate a
        DNA-based exploit....<b><br>

        As the presstitute media has no allegiance to truth, one has to
        wonder if we can even believe obituaries.<br>
        <br>
        For what it is worth, perhaps nothing, the presstitutes report
        that three US aircraft carrier battle groups are off North Korea
        or on the way there.<br>
        <br>
        What for? Why are the morons in Washington following the 19th
        century British practice of sending warships? This is juvenile.
        China has already said that China will allow no attack on North
        Korea unless Korea strikes first. The Russians have indicated
        their opposition as well. Both China and Russia have missiles
        that can wipe out the three aircraft battle groups at will. So
        what is the point of sending obsolete ships, like the
        battleships anchored in Pearl Harbor for the Japanese, other
        than to have them obliterated and to use their demise as an
        excuse to start World War III?<br>
        <br>
        The two-bit punk Washington puppet, NATO Secretary General
        Stoltenberg, has declared that “We recognize that Europe has
        also entered the North Korean missile range, and NATO member
        states are already in danger.” Remember, this was the same lie
        told about Europe being in range of non-existent Iranian
        missiles, an excuse for putting US missiles on Russia’s border
        just as North Korea is being used to put US missiles on China’s
        border.<br>
        <br>
        We also have the report that Vice President Pence visited the
        Minot Nuclear missile base and recklessly and irresponsibly told
        the launch crews:<br>
        <br>
        “We are entering a very dangerous time, and I have come here
        personally to tell you that you may receive a Launch Order in
        the near future.&nbsp; I want you to know that we have planned
        for all contingencies, but it is possible that things may
        escalate beyond what we believe will take place.&nbsp; If you
        receive a properly formatted launch order, you launch.&nbsp;
        Don’t waste time trying to confirm the order, because it is not
        standard operating procedure for you to delay like that.&nbsp;
        If you get a launch order, carry it out.”
http://halturnerradioshow.com/index.php/news/u-s-national-news/1505-vp-pence-makes-history-first-sitting-vp-to-personally-visit-minot-nuclear-missile-base-reportedly-tells-crews-if-the-order-comes-launch<br>
        <br>
        This irresponsible and reckless statement by a US vice president
        comes as the Russians celebrate the Soviet military official who
        refused to believe the Soviet warning system of incoming US
        nuclear missiles and did not start the process that would have
        resulted, for a warning system failure, in nuclear Armageddon.<br>
        <br>
        We should be scared to death that US political leaders are so
        insensitive to the ever present chance of false warnings. The
        moron Pence is a danger to all of humanity. Pence is not a
        patriot protecting us, he is an idiot who should be impeached
        for his utter and total irresponsibility before he destroys us
        all.<br>
        <br>
        Go online and read. False nuclear attack alarms were commonplace
        during the Cold War, but both Washington and Moscow were too
        responsible to act on them. Now we have an idiot vice president
        who wants to act on them!<br>
        <br>
        The idiots in Washington have ordered outmoded B-52 bombers to
        be on 24-hour alert. Why? Not a single one of them could
        penetrate Russian air defense. What is the purpose of this
        nonsensical order except to worsen distrust between nuclear
        powers. What crime is worse than worsening distrust between
        nuclear powers? Why is Washington completely hooked on criminal
        behavior? Who is responsible? Why are they not arrested for the
        endangerment of humanity and life on planet Earth?<br>
        <br>
        Washington’s disregard of urgent warnings from Russia and China
        is the most extraordinary thing I have experienced in my life.<br>
        <br>
        Why is it that Washington and Washington’s vassals can’t hear
        when powers capable of destroying all of them clearly state that
        they have had enough of Washington’s arrogance and hubris?<br>

        </b>A guided WHM breathing excercise by Wim Hof. The actual
        guided exercise starts at 1:40. Made and edited by NoëlKnows by
        Experience. Warning - important message, please read carefully:
        The breathing exercise has a profound effect and should be
        practiced in the way it is explained. Always do the breathing
        exercise in a safe environment (e.g. lying on a couch/floor) and
        unforced. Never practice the exercises before or during diving,
        driving, swimming, taking a bath or in any other
        environment/place where, should you pass out, a serious injury
        could occur. Wim Hof breathing may cause tingling sensations
        and/or lightheadedness. If you’ve fainted, it means that you
        went to far. Take a step back next time. The cold is a powerful
        force. I strongly advise to gradually build up exposing yourself
        to the cold. Always train without force and listen to your body
        carefully. If it is not practiced responsible, there is a risk
        of hypothermia. Do not practice the method during pregnancy or
        when having epilepsy. Persons with cardiovascular health issues,
        or any other (serious) health conditions, should always consult
        a medical doctor before starting with the Wim Hof Method.<br>

        </b>I tried the Wim Hof Breathing &amp; Cold Therapy Method for
        7 Days. The results are pretty profound, but not in the way I
        expected it. The method is pretty intense and extreme. Will I
        continue doing this? Is it safe? Is this just a fad or is this a
        proven method? The Wim Hof Method includes breathing exercises,
        cold therapy, some strength building exercises (push ups) and a
        special stretching technique. It's a widely followed technique
        and the popularity is growing. My interest in this technique
        started when I was fed up with winter and wanted to see what my
        body was capable of. I'm an Australian living in Iceland and I
        don't want to be afraid of the cold. And so my journey of
        discovery has begun. Warning: This is a VERY dangerous technique
        if not followed properly. Never do the breathing exercises
        whilst standing up, driving or underwater. It can result in you
        passing out and there have been deaths linked to people
        incorrectly trying this method. <br>

          <br>
        </b>A bioinspired, reusable, paper-based gold-nanoparticle film
        is fabricated by depositing an as-prepared gold-nanoparticle
        thin film on airlaid paper. This paper-based system with
        enhanced surface roughness and low thermal conductivity exhibits
        increased efficiency of evaporation, scale-up potential, and
        proven reusability. It is also demonstrated to be potentially
        useful in seawater desalination. <b><br>

          Abstract<br>
          <br>
        </b>Non-thermal plasmas under atmospheric pressure are of great
        interest in material surface processing because of their
        convenience, effectiveness and low cost. In this paper, the
        treatment of a glass surface for improving hydrophobicity using
        a non-thermal plasma generated by a dielectric barrier corona
        discharge (DBCD) with a needle array-to-plane electrode
        arrangement in atmospheric air is conducted, and the surface
        properties of the glass before and after the DBCD treatment are
        studied using contact angle measurement, surface resistance
        measurement and the wet flashover voltage test. The effects of
        the plasma dose (the product of average discharge power and
        treatment time) of DBCD on the surface modification are studied,
        and the mechanism of interaction between the plasma and glass
        surface is discussed. It is found that a layer of hydrophobic
        coating is formed on the glass surface through DBCD treatment,
        and the improvement of hydrophobicity depends on the plasma dose
        of the DBCD. It seems that there is an optimum plasma dose for
        the surface treatment. The test results of thermal ageing and
        chemical ageing show that the hydrophobic layer has quite stable
        characteristics.<b><br>

        <b><br>
        </b>This long post has four major parts:<br>
        <br>
        The NSA has been planning for money to "go electronic" for
        decades.<br>
        The new global monetary system will be centrally controlled and
        debt-based.<br>
        Clif High may be a "salesman" for this new monetary system.<br>
        The claimed "basis" (most valued fungible assets) of this new
        system will include silver...<br>
        <br>
        Part 3: Clif High may be a "salesman" for this new monetary
        system.<br>
        <br>
        I love listening to Clif High ... he's my kind of old fart
        computer geek. However ...<br>
        <br>
        In 2008, Clif High was predicting a summer of hell and a bloody
        revolution in America in 2009, followed by alien wars by 2011.<br>
        <br>
        In 2009, Clif High was predicting alien contact and an American
        Revolution, and other catastrophic earth and solar changes,
        leading to the death of a billion people, all by 2011.<br>
        <br>
        In 2010, Clif High was predicting escalating tensions in a
        "crocodile teeth" pattern (the same pattern he is forecasting,
        now in 2017, for the dollar price of bitcoin), building to a
        peek and a major release event, Nov 8-11, 2010, involving
        something such as a November 2010 "global thermonuclear war as
        the Allies take on the TPTB and their stooges, the Israelis and
        the American Military Empire. "<br>
        <br>
        In 2011, Clif High was predicting food hyperinflation, earth
        changes including “planetary earthquakes”, social chaos, and
        government collapse.<br>
        <br>
        Other predictions by Clif High for the period 2009 through 2012
        included massive world wide volcanos, a massive increase in UFO
        sightings, and the collapse of the US Dollar and economy.<br>
        <br>
        In April of 2013, Clif High was predicting a "Global Coastal
        Event" (GCE) by May of 2013. This GCE would be "every much to be
        the greatest event in our current human history".<br>
        <br>
        Clif High went somewhat more quiet in 2014 and 2015 (based on
        frequency of threads mentioning him on ProjectAvalon.net)<br>
        <br>
        In early 2016, Clif High was predicting that 2016 would be a
        "Year of Chaos, Nuclear Fallout, Megaquakes, Epidemics, Weather
        Wars".<br>
        <br>
        By late 2016, Clif High was anticipating that "At some point in
        2017, probably past mid-year, we’re going to be looking at
        hyperinflation so bad that the DOW will be measured around
        $100,000 to $125,000." Since there are still four months
        remaining in 2017, as I write this, this could still happen ...
        but I'm not expecting it.<br>
        <br>
        Currently, in mid 2017, Clif High is predicting major increases
        in the Dollar price of Bitcoins and silver, orders of magnitude
        greater than present. ... Perhaps, based on the success (or lack
        thereof) of his some of his previous predictions, I shouldn't
        invest all my (puny) life savings in Bitcoin and silver.<br>
        <br>
        My guess is that Clif High is hyping forecasts that serve the
        interests of some of the elite bastards. Other "alternative
        media analysts" that I enjoy following, such as Jim Willie, are
        making similar forecasts about silver and/or bitcoin. So I
        conclude that therefore, for some reason, the elite bastards
        want to hype the future of silver and bitcoin.<br>
        <br>
        I also have listened, many times, over many years, to Clif High
        describe the Perl and C code that implements his Webbot, and I
        have ocassionally purchased one of his Webbot reports. I have
        some 40 years of expertise in such scripting and code myself. My
        guess is that Clif High's webbot is less than he presents it to
        be, and that he uses the "magic of code that few could
        understand", but that is rather mundane in its abilities, to
        mystify and obfuscate the true origins of his analysis and
        forecast....<b><br>

        <b><br>
          Due Diligence Clues<br>
          <br>
        </b>These linguistic clues can be used in your due diligence
        work before investing in any crypto offering.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the language of the offering is touting a
        'technological innovation', beware, such are fleeting the world
        of software, being easily replicated. Further if that is the
        only claim to fame then you are betting on technological
        development and not a sound business plan. This rarely ends
        well.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When you read that an offering is going to
        make smart contracts usable, or easy, or accessible, are they
        speaking of running an education program? Or are they touting an
        alleged technical leap that will be most likely both ignored,
        and lept over in mere months by the next technological
        breakthrough. If they are proffering their technological edge,
        be wary of their future. These edges dull quickly, especially
        quickly in the software world. Other words in this category
        would include 'smart contract templates', and 'smart contract
        wizards'.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Legally enforceable smart contracts are yet
        more buzz words to avoid. Legal does not enter into the picture
        with software contracts. The software executes the contract, or
        it fails. Pretty binary, and not much to give to lawyers to
        argue about after the failure. It is simply not within the power
        of the legal system to force software to perform. Smart
        contracts by their very nature disintermediate the legal
        structure of humans.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any ICO that has 'storage' within its claim
        to fame, as in the idea of storing anything, data, pictures,
        fingerprints, et al, is to be avoided. Such language indicates
        either they don't have anyone with experience programming for
        blockchain networks, or their PR people are totally disconnected
        from the reality of the business. Either way, not a good
        situation. It costs too much to store data on the blockchain. It
        is inefficient by orders of magnitude over regular disk storage.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another idea that keeps coming up is the
        'decentralized search engine' as competition to Google. Avoid
        these, and there will be a great many of them. It is not
        possible to have a decentralized search engine, as by their
        nature, searches require centralized indexing in order to be
        efficient.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet another bad crypto idea is the
        decentralized, or blockchain enabled, advertising exchange. The
        idea is extremely appealing as a result of the ongoing
        'adpocalypse', and the even more recent petty fascist actions of
        the advertising exchanges supporting the globalista socialist
        agenda. These exchanges can technically work, but they will need
        to be specific about how they are going to handle the auctions,
        the linkages to web sites, the payment gateways, the security of
        the payment gateways, the placement of advertising on specific
        platform pages (such as Youtube), and a million other business
        questions that don't relate at all to the blockchain. Any ICO
        touting blockchain as the solution to the advertising problem,
        does not understand the workings of online advertising, and/or
        the blockchain.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet more caution words include
        'micro-payments'. Any micro-payments system that is blockchain
        based will also be, by its nature, incredibly computation
        focused, and this is as bad (expensive) on the blockchain as is
        storage. Not going to end well. As the popularity of a
        micro-payments based blockchain driven system increases, so will
        its costs, even more so, until, in the real world, it will cost
        more in processing fees, than the payment itself.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Popular fancy takes the blockchain into areas
        where it should not be going. One of these is the idea of a work
        exchange or job matching system. These are great ideas, but the
        blockchain will not be involved in delivery of resumes, or
        matching work seekers to employers. Why? Cost, of the processing
        to do the matching, and the cost of storage. IF these are being
        done at a computing center and the blockchain is only
        peripherally involved as a token between job and applicant, what
        purpose does the intrusion of the blockchain serve? Lacking a
        compelling business case for it, the blockchain, under these
        kind of circumstances, is merely yet another point of security
        vulnerability.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More bad words for crypto offerings include
        'community control', or any words where the 'community' will be
        'voting' on any aspect of the management of the item under
        offer. These are, by definition, not businesses, but are social
        engineering attempts. These will inevitably intrude on the
        business case for the offering. Collective management belongs in
        the dust bin of history with communism. Please note that there
        will be 'collectives' forming on and around blockchains that
        will become successful. Our data sets have such becoming
        powerful over time, however, we need to note that the data is
        showing that community management systems that do survive
        (precious few) will do so as the business case will dominate all
        the thinking, all the time. Again, please note that these
        'community based ICOs' show up in our data as primary sources
        for 'infighting', and 'internal meltdowns' that will be
        affecting CryptoSpace over the next decade.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Associated with the 'community control type'
        of cryptocurrencies, are the dreaded 'social doctor coins'.
        These ICOs will be touting the blockchain as a 'solution' to
        some form of perceived social problem. These ICOs are business
        disaster pigs painted with all manner of engaging social colors.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The final set of bad words for
        cryptocurrencies include 'distributed computing'. Running
        distributed computing is a nightmare, even when all aspects are
        tightly centralized. In the past it has not proven to be cost
        effective on any project. Merging cryptocurrencies and
        distributed computing is like giving your nightmare a belly
        ache. No good result will come from this.<b><br>

          <br>
        </b>TARPON SPRINGS, FL. 10/25/17. Dr. Ruggero M. Santilli, Chief
        Scientist of Thunder Energies Corporation, a publicly traded
        company with stock symbol (OTC:TNRG), suggest that small&nbsp;
        antimatter&nbsp;&nbsp; asteroids&nbsp; annihilating in our
        atmosphere should be considered, among other possibilities, as
        possible origin of at least some of the recent rapid wildfires
        in California that have caused the death of 42 fellow Americans:

          <br>
        </b>Dr. Santilli states: "Some or the peculiarities of the
        recent wildfires in California are the following: the rapidity
        of their occurrence such to prevent at times residents to leave
        their houses; the burning of cars at such a temperature to melt
        their metals while trees nearby were scorched but unburden; the
        apparent detection of fireballs coming from the sky; and other
        unusual occurrences:<b><br>

          <br>
        </b>Small matter&nbsp; asteroids&nbsp; cannot explain these
        peculiarities since, following an initial incandescence during
        their trajectory in our atmosphere, they cool down and drop to
        the ground without causing any fire. By contrast, small&nbsp;
        antimatter&nbsp;&nbsp; asteroids&nbsp; are known to annihilate
        at the contact with our atmosphere by creating an increasing
        fireball that will either explode in air or at ground by
        releasing all possible electromagnetic radiations without any
        crater on the ground, thus being a plausible origin of at least
        some of the recent rapid wildfires in California:<br>

        "It should ne noted that numerous fireballs followed by
        wildfires have occurred in the U. S. A. as well as abroad. The
        progressive annihilation in our atmosphere of small&nbsp;
        antimatter&nbsp;&nbsp; asteroids&nbsp; is also their most
        plausible interpretation due to the lack of craters in the
        ground, the progressive increase of their incandescence and

        <b> <br>
        </b>Dr. Santilli additionally states: "Unfortunately for serious
        scientific democracy, most of my former academic colleagues
        abuse their authority to dismiss and discredit as "fringe
        science" the existence of&nbsp; antimatter&nbsp;&nbsp;
        asteroids&nbsp; because they are not admitted by Einstein's
        theories. However, said theories were formulated decades before
        the discovery of&nbsp; antimatter . Hence, the dismissal
        of&nbsp; antimatter&nbsp;&nbsp; asteroids&nbsp; without due
        scientific process is deprecable because: done on the basis of
        an inapplicable theory; perpetrated in disrespect of our
        National Security; and voiced under the oblivion of clear
        experimental evidence in support of&nbsp; antimatter&nbsp;&nbsp;
        asteroids , which evidence includes not only the event here
        reported, but also the 1908 Tunguska explosion in Siberia which
        was the equivalent of one thousand Hiroshima nuclear bombs that
        flattened trees on an area as big as New England without any
        crater. To maintain the validity of Einstein theories also
        for&nbsp; antimatter , the widespread position in academia is
        that it was caused by an ice comet. The documented evidence
        ignored by academia is that people could read newspapers
        at&nbsp; midnight&nbsp; without artificial light in most of the
        Northern Hemisphere for days following the explosion. This
        evidence establishes that most of Earth's atmosphere had been
        ionized. This evidence discredits the academic views since an
        ice comet cannot possibly ionize Earth's atmosphere in any
        appreciable amount, and established beyond credible doubt that
        the Tunguska explosion was due to a large&nbsp; antimatter&nbsp;
        asteroid annihilating at contact with our atmosphere (see the
        chronology of the Tunguska explosion .<b><br>

          The Danger to our National Security<br>

        </b>The RMS Foundation supports due scientific process in the
        study of&nbsp; antimatter&nbsp;&nbsp; asteroids&nbsp; due to
        their relevance for National Security because, in the event our
        Country is hit by an&nbsp; antimatter&nbsp; asteroid the size of
        a football, all our civilian, industrial and military
        communications will be disrupted for days. In view of such a

        Meet happy apple (left) and sad apple (right). These are two
        halves of the same apple. On 20 May, I put each in an identical
        container. For the next six weeks, happy apple sang, laughed,
        danced and meditated with me. I spoke lovingly to it and thanked
        it for all its appley splendour. During the same period, I spoke
        a lot of smack to sad apple. I called it a useless, stinking
        piece of fruit, accused it of messing with my blood sugar
        levels, and generally gave it a hard time. I also let it listen
        to Metallica and watch the news. I let the experiment run for as
        long as I could before sad apple started to become a health
        hazard. What you see here are the results. Your words, emotions
        and intentions are probably (far) more powerful than you
        realise. Everything is energy. Just saying.<br>

        <br>
        Solar energy offers a viable solution to our growing energy
        need. While adoption of conventional photovoltaics on rooftops
        and in solar farms has grown rapidly in the last decade, there
        is still plenty of opportunity for expansion. See-through solar
        technologies with partial light transmission developed over the
        past 30 years have initiated methods of integration not possible
        with conventional modules. The large-scale deployment necessary
        to offset global energy consumption could be further accelerated
        by developing fully invisible solar cells that selectively
        absorb ultraviolet and near-infrared light, allowing many of the
        surfaces of our built environment to be turned into solar
        harvesting arrays without impacting the function or aesthetics.
        Here, we review recent advances in photovoltaics with varying
        degrees of visible light transparency. We discuss the figures of
        merit necessary to characterize transparent photovoltaics, and
        outline the requirements to enable their widespread adoption in
        buildings, windows, electronic device displays, and automobiles.<br>

        </b><b>Abstract</b><br>
        <br>
        Most mammalian species produce facial expressions. Historically,
        animal facial expressions have been considered inflexible and
        involuntary displays of emotional states rather than active
        attempts to communicate with others. In the current study, we
        aimed to test whether domestic dog facial expressions are
        subject to audience effects and/ or changes in response to an
        arousing stimulus (e.g. food) alone. We presented dogs with an
        experimental situation in which a human demonstrator was either
        attending to them or turned away, and varied whether she
        presented food or not. Dogs produced significantly more facial
        movements when the human was attentive than when she was not.
        The food, however, as a non-social but arousing stimulus, did
        not affect the dogs’ behaviour. The current study is therefore
        evidence that dogs are sensitive to the human’s attentional
        state when producing facial expressions, suggesting that facial
        expressions are not just inflexible and involuntary displays of
        emotional states, but rather potentially active attempts to
        communicate with others.<br>

        This style of construction is certainly worth considering and
        while I certainly approve of it, it can definitely be improved.
        For example, the “greenhouse” section for growing food could be
        four times more effective if shaped differently. The very
        experienced Les Brown of Canada explains this. Les Brown
        experimented extensively with pyramids. It should be stressed at
        this point in time that while various facts have been observed,
        the effects caused by a pyramid are not fully understood and so
        no “Laws” have yet been deduced. We have therefore, to work on
        the basis of “this is what was done and these were the results”.
        Because of this, the following extract from the work of the late
        Les Brown is reproduced here and you must decide for yourself if
        what he says is true and whether or not it might be worth your
        while trying out some of what he says:<br>
        <br>
        In conducting pyramid experiments you should look daily for
        signs of change and note them meticulously, and above all, be
        patient. Don’t plant a seed one day and expect to have a plant
        six feet tall the very next day. A plant takes just as long to
        develop inside a pyramid as it does outside, but as time passes
        you will see the tremendous difference in size. Also, don’t keep
        moving plants around inside your pyramid during an experiment –
        leave pots stationary so that you can see what the results are.<br>
        <br>
        You can make your own pyramids. They can be constructed entirely
        from inexpensive materials. Cardboard, wire, plywood or anything
        rigid enough to retain the pyramid shape will do. The pyramid
        does not necessarily have to be solid – in experiments, just the
        outline shape is sufficient provided that it is joined at all
        the corners and at the apex.<br>
        <br>
        Remember that with all types of pyramid, positioning is all
        important. One of the square base sides must point towards
        magnetic North. Use a compass to determine the direction of
        magnetic North. Several pyramids correctly orientated and
        stacked on top of one another will produce increased energy,
        cell activity and growth.<br>
        <br>
        Using pyramids, I sincerely believe that I can grow 36 times
        more and better plants in a given area than any farmer or market
        gardener can in the same area using conventional methods.<br>
        <br>
        When all four sides are put together, you must have a pyramid
        which is leaning in at 51 degrees, 51 minutes and 14 seconds. If
        you grow a plant inside a pyramid, it absorbs energy at a high
        intensity and so the result is enormous growth. When this is
        applied to vegetables and fruit, the plants as well as their
        products are immensely oversized. My own experiments have
        convinced me that this energy creates a special reaction in the
        living cells of plants, resulting in larger blooms, leaves and
        fruits on whatever plants are propagated within the pyramid.<br>
        <br>
        The normal life cycle of lettuce from seed to maturity is six to
        eight weeks. Grown under a pyramid the life cycle is still the
        same but the plant is considerably larger. If you allow the vine
        type of tomato to mature to six or seven trusses under a pyramid
        while simultaneously allowing an identical plant to do the same
        outside the pyramid, giving both of the plants the same feeding
        and watering, a startling difference in yield occurs. I should
        mention that if you put your outside plant too near the pyramid
        it will reach for and receive some of the pyramid’s energy, so
        keep it well away to get a fair comparison. The outside tomatoes
        would weigh out at approximately 10 to 14 pounds per plant,
        while the plant grown inside the pyramid will produce between 50
        and 60 pounds of tomatoes per plant. Not every type of plant
        grown under a pyramid will produce this increase but this is the
        average which I have come to expect from tomatoes.<br>
        <br>
        A few more averages which I have obtained repeatedly are:
        lettuce two to three times larger than average; beans 25 inches
        long and 1.25 inches wide; cabbage – when controls were 3 pounds
        each, the pyramid grown plants were 12 to 13 pounds per head;
        radishes that would normally be the size of a quarter were four
        inches in diameter, control cucumbers that averaged fourteen
        inches in length and weighed up to one pound normally, were 21
        inches long and weighed up to four pounds when grown in a
        pyramid.<br>
        <br>
        Energised air in the pyramid also appears to repel small
        insects, so there is no need to use pesticides within its glass
        walls. Pest-free plants grow to maturity inside, with none of
        the setbacks plants subject to normal attack from pests suffer
        in the garden outside. This also means that pyramid-grown
        vegetables need no washing upon harvesting. The mere appearance
        of such plants is more appetising than that of plants grown
        normally. Greens are more vivid and many leaves have a sheen
        which is noticeably absent from kitchen garden plants.<br>
        <br>
        An egg broken out of its shell and left inside a pyramid will
        gradually congeal and become like plastic as the pyramid energy
        works on its cells – harmlessly. The cells do not die or spoil.
        After a period of weeks or months, these congealed eggs can be
        reconstituted in water to the point where they can be eaten with
        complete safety, and they taste even more delicious than eggs
        prepared in the usual way.<br>
        <br>
        One peculiar phenomenon which I have observed under my large
        pyramid is the formation of dew on the plants inside it. This
        happens early in the morning. During all my years of experience
        with greenhouses, I never noticed dew forming on any plants in
        conventional greenhouses. This dew dissipates gently as the sun
        grows stronger, exactly as it would outside. Also, after a
        recent thunderstorm, my pyramid cucumbers grew two to two and a
        half inches in a matter of hours.<br>
        <br>
        I built a pyramid solely for research purposes. When building
        the prototype I encountered and overcame virtually all the
        problems one can expect to meet in a construction of this type.
        Building a pyramid is nothing like building a house, and while a
        slight difference in measurement can be overcome when building a
        house, it is not possible to make a mistake in building a
        pyramid and just carry on building. The particular piece
        containing the error must be pulled out and replaced correctly,
        as any mistake is transferred all the way around the pyramid.<br>
        <br>
        My test pyramid is 30 feet high at the peak. The sides from base
        corner to apex measure 44 feet 4.5 inches and each base edge is
        46 feet 10.5 inches. It contains two additional floors above
        ground level and the sum of the areas of these two floors is
        equal to or greater than that of the ground floor, Thus, the two
        additional floors virtually doubles the growing area.<br>
        <br>
        My first floor is 12 feet above the ground and there is a reason
        for this. I calculated that when the sun was at its highest
        point, the first floor would have to be at 12 feet high to allow
        the sun to shine on the back North edge of the ground floor. The
        12 foot height was perfect, but not absolutely necessary as
        there are as many plants that grow well in shade as there are
        plants that prefer the sun. In future, my pyramid floors will
        all be 8-feet apart and I will put my sun-loving plants in the
        southern half and my shade-loving plants in the back, Northern
        half.<br>
        <br>
        By putting the floors at 8-foot intervals there is much more
        growing area. With floors inside a pyramid, the higher up the
        floor, the higher the temperature there. For example, if the
        ground floor is at 75 degrees F. then the second floor would be
        at 90 degrees F. and the third floor would be at about 105 to
        115 degrees F. and each of the higher floors would also have
        higher humidity. The ground floor is perfect for such crops as
        radishes, lettuce, carrots, beets, tomatoes, etc. The second
        floor is ideal for cucumbers, squash, peppers and plants which
        like it hotter and more humid than the ground floor. The top
        floor can be used for lemons, oranges, figs and especially
        orchids.<br>
        <br>
        The pyramid draws in its own water on the ground floor; I have
        never had to water that level which is built directly on the
        ground. It never draws too much or too little water, always just
        the right amount for growth. Naturally, I have to pump water to
        the upper floors, but because the ground floor provides its own
        water supply, at least half of my pyramid is watered
        automatically for no cost. I grow right in the ground on which
        the pyramid stands, but upstairs I have placed wooden planting
        troughs all around the floors, leaving room to walk, and I grow
        plants in these. It is a major job getting soil to the upper
        floors initially, but that is a one-time task. The troughs are
        14 inches wide and 16 inches deep and have a bottom.<br>
        <br>
        Space in the pyramid is used to the utmost. At the perimeter of
        the low areas I plant the kind of plants that need little
        headroom, and then plant the bigger crops towards the middle.
        This is a matter of common sense, but using the vine type
        tomatoes and stringing them up, one can work better between the
        rows, and if the lower leaves are removed, there is sufficient
        space to grow lettuce, cabbage or any low-lying crop in between
        the tomato plants. The trusses may be left on the tomatoes as
        they will not shade the low-lying plants.<br>
        <br>
        To ensure a steady supply of food, it is wise to plant only a
        few plants of each variety at intervals, which means that in the
        beginning it will take several weeks to reap a full harvest, but
        after that there will be a continuous yield. By planting in such
        a manner, the grower will reap about six full crops each year.
        This method applies only to an enclosed pyramid, which would
        also need heating in the winter. The means of heating is up to
        the individual. Personally, I use a wood-burning stove because I
        have my own supply of wood. However, a wood and oil combination
        is best because it allows one to be away for a couple of days
        when necessary and then if the wood fire gets low, then the oil
        burner takes over...<br>

              kill any cancer cell</font></b><br>
          <br>
          <i>Time traveling hundreds of millions of years to unleash one
            of nature's original kill switches</i><br>
        </div>
        <br>
        CHICAGO --- Small RNA molecules originally developed as a tool
        to study gene function trigger a mechanism hidden in every cell
        that forces the cell to commit suicide, reports a new
        Northwestern Medicine study, the first to identify molecules to
        trigger a fail-safe mechanism that may protect us from cancer.<br>
        <br>
        The mechanism -- RNA suicide molecules -- can potentially be
        developed into a novel form of cancer therapy, the study authors
        said.<br>
        <br>
        Cancer cells treated with the RNA molecules never become
        resistant to them because they simultaneously eliminate multiple
        genes that cancer cells need for survival.<br>
        <br>
        "It's like committing suicide by stabbing yourself, shooting
        yourself and jumping off a building all at the same time," said
        Northwestern scientist and lead study author Marcus Peter. "You
        cannot survive."<br>
        <br>
        The inability of cancer cells to develop resistance to the
        molecules is a first, Peter said.<br>
        <br>
        "This could be a major breakthrough," noted Peter, the Tom D.
        Spies Professor of Cancer Metabolism at Northwestern University
        Feinberg School of Medicine.<br>
        <br>
        Peter and his team discovered sequences in the human genome that
        when converted into small double-stranded RNA molecules trigger
        what they believe to be an ancient kill switch in cells to
        prevent cancer. He has been searching for the phantom molecules
        with this activity for eight years.<br>
        <br>
        "We think this is how multicellular organisms eliminated cancer
        before the development of the adaptive immune system, which is
        about 500 million years old," he said. "It could be a fail safe
        that forces rogue cells to commit suicide. We believe it is
        active in every cell protecting us from cancer."<br>
        <br>
        This study, which will be published Oct. 24 in eLife, and two
        other new Northwestern studies in Oncotarget and Cell Cycle by
        the Peter group, describe the discovery of the assassin
        molecules present in multiple human genes and their powerful
        effect on cancer in mice.<br>
        <br>
        Looking back hundreds of millions of years<br>
        <br>
        Why are these molecules so powerful?<br>
        <br>
        "Ever since life became multicellular, which could be more than
        2 billion years ago, it had to deal with preventing or fighting
        cancer," Peter said. "So nature must have developed a fail safe
        mechanism to prevent cancer or fight it the moment it forms.
        Otherwise, we wouldn't still be here."<br>
        <br>
        Thus began his search for natural molecules coded in the genome
        that kill cancer.<br>
        <br>
        "We knew they would be very hard to find," Peter said. "The kill
        mechanism would only be active in a single cell the moment it
        becomes cancerous. It was a needle in a haystack."<br>
        <br>
        But he found them by testing a class of small RNAs, called small
        interfering (si)RNAs, scientists use to suppress gene activity.
        siRNAs are designed by taking short sequences of the gene to be
        targeted and converting them into double- stranded RNA. These
        siRNAs when introduced into cells suppress the expression of the
        gene they are derived from.<br>
        <br>
        Peter found that a large number of these small RNAs derived from
        certain genes did not, as expected, only suppress the gene they
        were designed against. They also killed all cancer cells. His
        team discovered these special sequences are distributed
        throughout the human genome, embedded in multiple genes as shown
        in the study in Cell Cycle.<br>
        <br>
        When converted to siRNAs, these sequences all act as highly
        trained super assassins. They kill the cells by simultaneously
        eliminating the genes required for cell survival. By taking out
        these survivor genes, the assassin molecule activates multiple
        death cell pathways in parallel.<br>
        <br>
        The small RNA assassin molecules trigger a mechanism Peter calls
        DISE, for Death Induced by Survival gene Elimination.<br>
        <br>
        Activating DISE in organisms with cancer might allow cancer
        cells to be eliminated. Peter's group has evidence this form of
        cell death preferentially affects cancer cells with little
        effect on normal cells.<br>
        <br>
        To test this in a treatment situation, Peter collaborated with
        Dr. Shad Thaxton, associate professor of urology at Feinberg, to
        deliver the assassin molecules via nanoparticles to mice bearing
        human ovarian cancer. In the treated mice, the treatment
        strongly reduced the tumor growth with no toxicity to the mice,
        reports the study in Oncotarget. Importantly, the tumors did not
        develop resistance to this form of cancer treatment. Peter and
        Thaxton are now refining the treatment to increase its efficacy.<br>
        <br>
        Peter has long been frustrated with the lack of progress in
        solid cancer treatment.<br>
        <br>
        "The problem is cancer cells are so diverse that even though the
        drugs, designed to target single cancer driving genes, often
        initially are effective, they eventually stop working and
        patients succumb to the disease," Peter said. He thinks a number
        of cancer cell subsets are never really affected by most
        targeted anticancer drugs currently used.<br>
        <br>
        Most of the advanced solid cancers such as brain, lung,
        pancreatic or ovarian cancer have not seen an improvement in
        survival, Peter said.<br>
        <br>
        "If you had an aggressive, metastasizing form of the disease 50
        years ago, you were busted back then and you are still busted
        today," he said. "Improvements are often due to better detection
        methods and not to better treatments."<br>
        <br>
        Cancer scientists need to listen to nature more, Peter said.
        Immune therapy has been a success, he noted, because it is aimed
        at activating an anticancer mechanism that evolution developed.
        Unfortunately, few cancers respond to immune therapy and only a
        few patients with these cancers benefit, he said.<br>
        <br>
        "Our research may be tapping into one of nature's original kill
        switches, and we hope the impact will affect many cancers," he
        said. "Our findings could be disruptive."<br>

        Radioactive waste - this is an old, unsolved problem of all
        mankind. Chernobyl and Fukushima have shown the destructive
        power of the "evil atom." However, the solution to this problem
        exists. There are many techniques of neutralization (and not a
        simple process) radioactive waste. One of them - biological
        transmutation developed by chemists and biotechnologists
        V.Kurashov and T.Sahno. The technology was introduced at a press
        conference in Switzerland, 21 June 2016. In this video, Victor
        Kurashov talks about the details of this process. Another
        available technology developed by Professor Ruggero Santilli,
        founder of the firm "Magnegaz". Why these technologies are still
        not being used? Prof. Santilli has repeatedly tried to convene
        an international conference on this issue. He ran into strong
        resistance and even physical threats. Alas, but the introduction
        of such technologies is not profitable for government officials
        who control the financial flows, as well as for oil and
        financial corporations, who seeking to maintain the status quo.<br>

        This is Dr. Russell Blaylock (Neurosurgeon) discussing the
        neurodegenerative harm done by Excitotoxins, especially
        Aspartame (Dr. Adrian Gross of the FDA in 1987 Decried Aspartame

        To:&nbsp; Dr. Joseph Thomas / From: "Dr. Betty Martini,D.Hum." /
        Subject: Advantame<br>
        <br>
        ...Dr. Richard Wurtman at MIT wrote: "Possible Neurologic
        Effects of Aspartame, a widely used food additive": He said in
        the abstract: The artificial sweetener aspartame
        (L-aspartyl-L-phenylalanyl-methyl ester), is consumed, primarily
        in beverages, by a very large number of Americans, causing
        significant elevations in plasma and, probably, brain
        phenylalanine levels. Anecdotal reports suggest that some people
        suffer neurologic or behavioral reactions in association with
        aspartame consumption. Since phenylalanine can be neurotoxic and
        can affect the synthesis of inhibitory monoamine
        neurotransmitters, the phenylalanine in aspartame could
        conceivably mediate neurologic effects. If mice are given
        aspartame in doses that elevate plasma phenylalanine levels more
        than those of tyrosine (which probably occurs after any
        aspartame dose in humans), the frequency of seizures following
        the administration of an epileptogenic drug, pentylenetetrazole,
        is enhanced. This effect is simulated by equimolar phenylalanine
        and blocked by concurrent administration of valine, which blocks
        phenylalanine's entry into the brain. Aspartame also potentiates
        the induction of seizures by inhaled fluorothyl or by
        electroconvulsive shock. Perhaps regulations concerning the sale
        of food additives should be modified to require the reporting of
        adverse reactions and the continuing conduct of mandated safety
        research." https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1474447/<br>
        <br>
        After Dr. Wurtman had received 80 cases of seizures from
        aspartame he said it was enough to have it removed from the
        market. The phenylalanine always has affected all consumers, not
        just phenylketonurics. Removing the PKU warning is inexcusable.
        Dr. Wurtman's medical text is "Dietary Phenylalanine and Brain
        Function" - Richard J. Wurtman and Eva Ritter-Walker<br>
        <br>
        Industry knows about the warnings so The International Dairy
        Foods Association (IDFA) and the National Milk Producers
        Federation (NMPF) filed a petition with FDA to allow aspartame
        in milk and 17 other dairy products unlabeled. This is against
        the law but instead of telling Big Dairy they wouldn't permit it
        FDA states its a way to get them to drink their milk. (Dr. David
        Hattan). In other words the children are warned not to use
        anything low fat or with aspartame so they won't be harmed by
        the poison and the FDA sacrifices them for the profit of Big
        Dairy. I remember when this came out I was in Chicago visiting
        Jerome Bressler. I was sitting on his bed in a nursing home
        showing him the paperwork and he said, "Betty, the FDA can't
        allow this, it's absolutely against the law." I said, "Jerome,
        they sealed the two mouse studies and the cover letter, in your
        Bressler Report so the public wouldn't know aspartame causes
        birth defects, one of the most hideous crimes in FDA history,
        why would you think they would change now?" He just hung his
        head and said, "no protection of the public". Even before he
        became bedridden he told people in the nursing home "don't drink
        diet pop, its poison"!<br>
        <br>
        So now we have Ajinomoto saying Advantame can be used to flavor
        dairy drinks. Will it be labeled or used unlawfully like
        aspartame? First lets get this out of the way. Aspartame was
        never proven safe and you know it. (<b>"Sweet Misery: A Poisoned
          World" - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZI7_8FDzuJE</b>).
        Here in this hour and a half documentary Attorney James Turner
        explains how aspartame was marketed because of the political
        chicanery of Don Rumsfeld...<br>

        <br>
        Synopsis -- The author has spent many years analyzing the
        construction and power that is generated from this engine. He
        has obtained 2 patents from the US Patent Office, and the
        physicists, mathematicians, and scientists, at the patent office
        have also examined the propulsion system. They have put their
        stamp of approval on the design that it will work, and concluded
        that it would be a benefit to mankind. First of all, the
        hypothesis of the power generated by this engine, disagrees with
        one of the first laws of physics, which involves the
        "conservation of energy". More specifically, MORE ENERGY CAN NOT
        BE GOTTEN OUT OF AN ENGINE THAN IS PUT INTO IT. As an engineer,
        this was one of the first laws that I had to memorize, but now,
        I know, beyond any doubt, that "this law is wrong! Please read
        my entire book and understand it, before making any preconceived
        judgments about my above statements. This may be hard to do, if
        you are not a very good engineer. Later, the principles of the
        working parts of this engine, will be taught as a separate
        subject in college, and will be an anomaly to this general rule
        of the conservation of energy. The power generated by this
        engine would be equivalent to the falsely taught axiom in
        physics for centuries that stated "matter could not be created
        or destroyed". This axiom was destroyed when the first atomic
        bomb was exploded in 1945, and henceforth, this axiom has not
        been taught in our colleges. As you analyze the equation that
        powers this engine, that allows it to run indefinitely, you will
        see how Sir Charles Coulomb's "Electrostatic Force Equation",
        and more specifically "the speed of light squared" in this
        formula, that tremendous power can be generated, far beyond the
        power that is put into this engine. As you will see later the
        calculations show that, using the given data shown in this
        report, the ratio (output) to the energy (input) is 302 to 1.
        This is incredible, and will literally change the world as we
        know it. This book will prove with US Patents, how an engine can
        be designed, that can literally run without any petroleum
        products, that can be used to run automobile engines, electric
        generators, engines for outer space, and "free electric power"
        for use on this earth as well as outer space. OTHER BOOKS/DVDs

              motivates behavior change discovered</font></b><br>
        </div>
        <br>
        Have you ever been stuck in a rut, going through the same
        motions day in and day out? How do you motivate to change your
        behavior?<br>
        <br>
        Researchers from the University of Pennsylvania, Yale
        University, Columbia University and Duke University now better
        understand how this happens, and it has to do with a region in
        the brain called the posterior cingulate cortex. They learned
        that neurons in this central location ramp up firing rates,
        peaking just before a divergent behavior occurs. They published
        their findings in the journal Neuron.<br>
        <br>
        "The circuits in our brain that allow us to focus on a
        particular task, especially a task that leads to reward, are
        well known," said Michael Platt, the James S. Riepe University
        Professor in Penn's psychology, neuroscience and marketing
        departments. "These evolved very early in the history of life on
        this planet."<br>
        <br>
        What's less established is which trigger in the brain causes
        people to break from a routine, especially when doing so poses
        potential risks.<br>
        <br>
        Two experiments the research team conducted -- one called the
        patch-leaving task, the other dubbed the traveling salesman --
        provided some important insights.<br>
        <br>
        In the first, Platt and colleagues looked at the foraging
        behaviors of rhesus macaques, a non-human primate species the
        researchers have studied both in the lab and in the wild. The
        animals had the choice between harvesting a juice reward that
        depleted over time but was guaranteed and immediate or moving to
        a new "patch," which would require more time and energy but
        offered a potentially larger reward.<br>
        <br>
        "Imagine you're picking berries in a tree," he said. "At first
        it's easy, but after a while you have to climb farther and
        farther out on weaker branches to get the berries, most of which
        probably aren't ripe. At some point it makes sense to take the
        time and energy to go to the next tree."<br>
        <br>
        To understand the second experiment, think about an effective
        traveling salesman. The merchant moves from door to door,
        interacting with people in the hopes of making a deal. Not
        everyone purchases a product, though there is an ideal pattern
        for success. Once the salesman understands this, he follows that
        pattern until it stops working and a behavior change is
        necessary for continued prosperity.<br>
        <br>
        Monkeys in the traveling-salesman experiment had the option to
        visit six different locations, two of which contained rewards,
        one large and one small. The reward spots were randomized, and
        they changed each time the experiment ran.<br>
        <br>
        "The optimal solution is to develop a routine where you visit
        all of them in a circle. That's the best you can do; you go from
        nearest neighbor to next neighbor. That's what monkeys do in the
        wild. That's what bumblebees do in the wild," Platt said.
        "Occasionally, these animals break off to explore for something
        that might be better, kind of like what people do in a grocery
        store. Suddenly monkeys here would break off and go out of
        order. We didn't know why."<br>
        <br>
        Simultaneous to watching the macaques' behavior in both
        experiments, Platt and his colleagues recorded neuron behavior
        in the posterior cingulate cortex. Neural activity there built
        up until it peaked, at which point the animals changed course,
        revealing correlational evidence that this spike in brain
        function leads to the divergent thinking and action rather than
        happens because of it.<br>
        <br>
        "If you increased activity in the area exogenously, if I put an
        electrode in there and stimulated, then you would break off from
        the routine, you would become more exploratory," Platt said.
        "Similarly, if you could suppress activity, you'd see the
        opposite. You'd become hyper-focused on one option, and you may
        never make a change."<br>
        <br>
        These findings have potential business applications in terms of
        innovation and exploration. Techniques that directly activate
        the posterior cingulate cortex like brain stimulation or game
        play that promotes distraction, particularly within situations
        that don't allow a routine to form, can lead to more creativity.<br>
        <br>
        "People who have more activity there have more mind-wandering,
        and they tend to be more creative," according to Platt. "It
        suggests that capacity to be more creative evolved for a very
        specific purpose, which is to allow you to forage efficiently in
        a landscape that's always changing."<br>

        <b>Summary</b><br>
        <br>
        Foraging for resources is a fundamental behavior balancing
        systematic search and strategic disengagement. The foraging
        behavior of primates is especially complex and requires
        long-term memory, value comparison, strategic planning, and
        decision-making. Here we provide evidence from two different
        foraging tasks that neurons in primate posterior cingulate
        cortex (PCC) signal decision salience during foraging to
        motivate disengagement from the current strategy. In our
        foraging tasks, salience refers to the difference between
        decision thresholds and the net harvested reward. Salience
        signals were stronger in poor foraging contexts than rich ones,
        suggesting low harvest rates recruit mechanisms in PCC that
        regulate strategic disengagement and exploration during
        foraging.<br>
