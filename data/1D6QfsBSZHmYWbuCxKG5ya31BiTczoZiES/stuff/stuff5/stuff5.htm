      ...In the journal Nature, scientists -- who conducted much of
      their work in the secretive, high-containment biological
      laboratory maintained by USAMRIID at Fort Detrick, Maryland --
      have reported the discovery of a small molecule that rescues
      rodents and monkeys from various hemorrhagic fevers. Even more,
      the drug exhibited activity against a wide range of viruses.<br>
      <br>
      The molecule, named BCX4430... can be accidentally used by the
      virus when it is trying to grow inside of our cells. For the
      virus, this is a fatal mistake. BCX4430 blocks further growth and
      reproduction...<br>
      <br>
      The most compelling experiment the research team ran involved the
      infection of cynomolgus macaque monkeys with deadly Marburg virus.
      Macaques were given twice daily doses of BCX4430 for 14 days
      beginning 1 hour, 24 hours, or 48 hours post-infection. (See
      graph. There were six monkeys in each treatment group.)<br>
      <br>
      As shown above, all of the monkeys that did not receive BCX4430
      (labeled "vehicle") died by day 12. However, every monkey (except
      for one) that received a dose of BCX4430 survived, even if the
      initial dose came 48 hours after infection. In total, 17 out of 18
      treated monkeys lived...<br>
      <br>
      Amazingly, in vitro experiments showed that BCX4430 could
      potentially work against a wide range of viruses, including SARS,
      MERS, influenza, dengue, and measles.<br>

            by a novel broad-spectrum nucleoside analogue BCX4430</b><br>

      Filoviruses are emerging pathogens and causative agents of viral
      haemorrhagic fever. Case fatality rates of filovirus disease
      outbreaks are among the highest reported for any human pathogen,
      exceeding 90% (ref. 1). Licensed therapeutic or vaccine products
      are not available to treat filovirus diseases. Candidate
      therapeutics previously shown to be efficacious in non-human
      primate disease models are based on virus-specific designs and
      have limited broad-spectrum antiviral potential. Here we show that
      BCX4430, a novel synthetic adenosine analogue, inhibits infection
      of distinct filoviruses in human cells. Biochemical,
      reporter-based and primer-extension assays indicate that BCX4430
      inhibits viral RNA polymerase function, acting as a non-obligate
      RNA chain terminator. Post-exposure intramuscular administration
      of BCX4430 protects against Ebola virus and Marburg virus disease
      in rodent models. Most importantly, BCX4430 completely protects
      cynomolgus macaques from Marburg virus infection when administered
      as late as 48 hours after infection. In addition, BCX4430 exhibits
      broad-spectrum antiviral activity against numerous viruses,
      including bunyaviruses, arenaviruses, paramyxoviruses,
      coronaviruses and flaviviruses. This is the first report, to our
      knowledge, of non-human primate protection from filovirus disease
      by a synthetic drug-like small molecule. We provide additional
      pharmacological characterizations supporting the potential
      development of BCX4430 as a countermeasure against human filovirus
      diseases and other viral diseases representing major public health
      threats.<br>

      </div>
      <br>
      <b>newwatersources.org</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Water is still being created by geological forces. That water,
      usually in a potable form, comes to the earth's surface in
      thousands of places, some well known like Jericho and Bahrain
      where it has provided drinking water for thousands of people for
      thousands of years. It pours into deep mines all over the world.
      Hundreds of houses on the rocky shores of Maine get their fresh
      water from wells drilled into the shoreline granite. Copenhagen
      gets all its water from a few wells. In Northern Europe, water
      that can be tapped by wells that do not depend on aquifers is
      called "ground water". The hallmark of new, or primary, water
      springs and wells is that they provide water at constant
      temperature and flow.<br>
      <br>
      But this world-wide source of "new water" has been ignored by
      geologists and laymen in most countries including the United
      States. They were taught that all potable water comes from the
      "hydrological cycle" which merely recycles water already on the
      surface of our earth.<br>
      <br>
      Michael H. Salzman, an engineer and administrator, researched,
      wrote and published a book providing detailed information on "new
      water". As published in 1960, it can be read and/or downloaded
      from this website. It is not readily available in libraries.<br>
      <br>
      Mike was a long time friend. He handed me one of his last copies
      in 1970 and asked me to see if I could get some recognition for
      it. He told me some wealthy people wanting to get approval for
      funds to build an aqueduct to bring water from the Colorado River
      to southern California (they succeeded) had bought up and burned
      all the copies they could find. They also tried (and failed) to
      have him fired as Director of the Los Angeles Housing Authority.<br>
      <br>
      Today, there is renewed interest in "new water". Two companies are
      working on projects to bring potable "new water" to areas where
      surface and ordinary well water are contaminated or nearly
      exhausted. Including wells for primary water drilled in Australia,
      Southern California and elsewhere, it appears more than 1,000 such
      wells have been drilled in recent years.<br>

      Space energy exists , as scientists give - but to harness it is
      not yet . Stubbornly holding in the free-energy scene rumored that
      space power converter only therefore are not yet on the market ,
      because powerful interests prevent this. The " Coler - power
      generator " seems to confirm this suspicion. Invented in the 1920s
      by the German researcher Hans Coler supplied the device ,
      according to respected scientists actually have more energy than
      it consumed . But the outbreak of World War II stopped the
      development. After the war, the British Coler brought to their
      island , and soon after the inventor died. Dr. Thorsten Ludwig and

      Introduction to the dimmer Sun<br>
      <br>
      In December 2012 the plasma physicist David LaPoint published a
      series of videos about a phenomenon that he called: 'The Primer
      Fields.' With his discovery he takes aim at long-held mistaken
      theories about the physical universe, including black holes, dark
      matter, and dark energy, which are not required to interpret the
      observed evidence of the universe.<br>
      <br>
      In his videos David LaPoint illustrates the existence, and the
      operating principles, of the most basic electromagnetic fields
      that shape the solar system, the galactic system, and ultimately
      the cosmic environment. He suggests that these basic primal
      fields, which he discusses, are fundamental to the order and
      operation of the universe, and are even reflected in the
      transmission of light and the structure of matter itself, all the
      way down to its smallest subatomic forms.<br>
      <br>
      On the gigantic scale the electromagnetic fields that he
      recognized to exist, and has explored in the laboratory, shape
      entire galaxies. They are so fundamental to almost everything,
      that he calls them "The Primer Fields." In fact, without the
      Primer Fields and their effects on our Sun and planets, even the
      galaxy itself, might not have been created, so that nothing would
      actually exist without them. <br>
      <br>
      Star formation in a galaxy typically occurs in intensely focused
      and compressed plasma that the Primer Fields facilitate, to the
      point that nuclear fusion occurs, by which atoms, stars, planets,
      and entire galaxies are formed.<br>
      <br>
      The term, Primer Fields, is also justified, because on the '
      smaller' stage of our solar system, the operation of the Primer
      Fields, though they are correspondingly smaller in size than on
      the galactic scale seen here, is critical for the dynamic
      operation of our solar system as a single functional unit. <br>
      <br>
      David LaPoint also discovered that the principles of the fields,
      that he calls the Primer Fields, is such that the galactic plasma
      streams that flow through the solar system become concentrated to
      a high degree of density around the Sun, which he replicated in
      principle in laboratory experiments. The result of his work brings
      a radically new dimension to the perception of the Sun and also of
      the dynamics of the ice ages.<br>
      <br>
      The perception of the Sun as an electrically powered star has
      existed for a long time already. A large body of evidence exists
      to support the electric Sun theory. But it had a weak point. For
      the theory to work, a high concentration of electric plasma is
      required to exist around the Sun, which put the theory in doubt.
      As an alternative, the theory of the nuclear fusion-powered Sun
      was created, except the observed evidence doesn't support this
      theory either.<br>
      <br>
      The sunspots on the surface of the Sun show the Sun to be darker
      below the surface. We should see the opposite if the Sun was
      internally powered, instead of it being electrically powered at
      the surface.<br>
      <br>
      Also the fusion Sun theory cannot readily explain the 11-year
      solar activity cycles in which the brightness of the Sun varies by
      a factor of 20 when observed in the high ultraviolet band. The
      fusion Sun theory has it that the photon travel time from the
      Sun's deemed fusion center to the surface, is deemed to be in the
      range between 10,000 and 170,000 years, while the assumed
      energy-transfer time itself, from the center of the sun to the
      surface, is deemed to be on the order of 30 million years. This
      hardly supports the 11-year solar cycles, in which the Sun's
      magnetic field changes direction at every cycle.<br>
      <br>
      The contribution that David LaPoint brings to the table in this
      debate weighs enormously in support of the electric-Sun theory by
      illustrating how the high density plasma field is created around
      the Sun that the theory depends on. The Primer Fields theory takes
      away the barrier against the electric-Sun theory, which thereby
      becomes totally plausible, together with a number of related
      theories that thereby likewise become plausible. However, the
      Primer Fields theory takes us one critical step beyond merely
      supporting the electric-Sun theory. It renders the functioning of
      the electric Sun subject to a minimal threshold of conditions that
      must be met for the Sun to be powered, which, when it is not met,
      causes the Sun to become inactive, dim, and 'cold.'<br>
      <br>
      While David LaPoint may not have intended to support the
      electric-sun theory, his work illustrates that the process that
      creates a dense plasma sphere around the Sun happens, because the
      Primer Fields have that effect. It is known in plasma physics that
      these fields themselves depend for their existence on a minimal
      density in the plasma that flows through the system. If the
      threshold is not reached, the fields do not form. If the fields do
      not form, or cannot be maintained, the Sun does not have the
      condition established for it to be powered.<br>
      <br>
      The Sun simply turns off to an inactive state in which it glows
      dimly by its stored up energy and some nuclear decay processes
      within it.<br>
      <br>
      The required threshold, therefore, becomes an important factor in
      considering the dynamics of the ice ages. Just imagine the
      consequences on the Earth when our brilliant sun is suddenly
      turned off as the Primer Fields collapse, and looses more than
      two-thirds of its energy output in possibly a single day.<br>
      <br>
      The conventional theories of the ice age dynamics all regard the
      ice age glaciation as the result of a gradual cooling of the
      Earth. One theory sees the cooling being caused by cyclical
      variations of the orbit of the Earth around the Sun, with the Sun
      remaining an invariable constant by this theory. In the fusion-Sun
      theory, the Sun is deemed to be an invariable constant, so that
      the ice ages are caused by anything else except the Sun.<br>
      <br>
      The resulting orbital-variation theory, known as the Milankovitch
      theory, however has so many holes in its fabric that it is
      generally no longer seriously considered as a cause for the ice
      ages.<br>
      <br>
      The standard electric-sun theory doesn't have this problem. Plenty
      of evidence exists that the power output of the Sun does vary with
      the density of the electric input. The large temperature
      fluctuations that are known to have occurred over the last half
      billion years are evidently the result of cyclical electric input
      fluctuations. The Primer Fields theory does not change that, but
      it does open the gate to the recognition that the entire process
      of the powered Sun can collapse when a minimal power-input
      threshold is not met, as we have seen happening during the ice
      ages.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      The Primer Field theory brings a huge difference to the table. In
      the past it was believed that ice age conditions develop slowly
      and gradually over extended periods, so that humanity can adjust
      itself to the changing conditions, even in cases when the Earth
      becomes five times colder than the Little Ice Age had been, over
      the span of 50 years. The Primer Fields theory jolts us out of
      this dream, or at least it should.<br>
      <br>
      If the fields are not maintained sufficiently that they collapse
      and vanish, extremely radical changes occur in as short a time as
      possibly a single day. The Primer Fields theory takes away the
      general notion that we have a long time to prepare for the coming
      Ice Age and don't need to respond yet. It tells us that the
      opposite is true; that we need to get prepared as fast as
      possible, which almost no one is yet willing to even consider. In
      this context the Primer Fields theory presents us a great blessing
      in disguise.<br>
      <br>
      It forces us, if we are willing to respond, to re-develop our
      humanity as fast as possible, which we urgently need in the
      present to avoid the catastrophe of nuclear war that no one will
      likely survive, for which the preparations are evermore intensely
      pursued in numerous ways. <br>
      <br>
      In this regard the potentially near, rapid ice age transition that
      the Primer Fields theory brings into view, offers us an incentive
      to get our act together, which would be the greatest salvation
      that we could experience on every front where civilization is
      presently fast collapsing.<br>
      <br>
      The Primer Fields theory illustrates a single basic principle that
      applies to all complex systems, including civilization. In
      economics, when the creative and productive power of a nation
      diminishes below a minimal threshold, the entire economic system
      disintegrates. It becomes inactive. The nations collapse. The
      world becomes cold. The people die. <br>
      <br>
      This happens to cultures too when the recognized value of our
      humanity drops below a minimal threshold. Nuclear war happens
      then, when the humanist culture disintegrates. <br>
      <br>
      We are close to the minimal threshold on a number of these vital
      fronts, especially in economics. <br>
      <br>
      For example, when the assumed value of money drops below the point
      where the value of money becomes uncertain in the markets, it
      becomes meaningless at this point. At this point the financial
      markets collapse, banks close, stores close, gas stations close,
      transportation collapses, the food supply system stops, the entire
      platform of physical infrastructures becomes inactive. <br>
      <br>
      The world's money-value system can unravel in a single day. No one
      knows how close we are to this day. The Glass Steagall law that
      once protected the value of money in the USA, has been repealed in
      Congress in 1999 by a bunch of traitors who were bribed to do so
      with a $350 million slush fund. To date all efforts have failed to
      restore even this minimal protection of the value of currency that
      the repealed law had afforded for the 66 years in which it was
      active. Against the background of the now fast collapsing value of
      money the entire economic system can collapse in a single day,
      just as the presently powered Sun can go inactive in a day when
      the fields collapse that prime its operational environment.<br>
      <br>
      David LaPoint's work illustrates that the electric Sun, which
      varies only slightly during the interglacial warm period that we
      are presently enjoying, will with great certainty go completely
      inactive when the plasma density of the electric streams feeding
      into the solar system falls below the threshold level where the
      primer fields collapse.<br>
      <br>
      In astrophysics, that's the point where the ice age transition
      begins. That's what happened 120,000 years ago.<br>
      <br>
      The current trend suggests that we will cross the cut-off
      threshold in the near future. An ice age begins when the minimal
      conditions no longer exist for the system to function, that powers
      the Sun.<br>
      <br>
      The Sun reverts to its default state then - its inactive state. It
      turns dim in a single short step, and the climate on earth that
      looses two thirds of its energy input, turns cold. At this point
      rapid deep cooling begins all across the Earth.<br>
      <br>
      Before this point is upon us, all the preparations for the
      dramatic changes in the Earth's environment will have to be
      completed. To fail is not an option if we want to continue to
      live. For this reason it is not an option either that we raise the
      value of our humanity far above the present level and protect it
      on all fronts. And this needs to begin now.<br>
      <br>
      The analysis of ice cores drilled from the ice sheets of Greenland
      indicates that the Sun became inactive 120,000 years ago. That's
      when the last Ice Age started. The ice core records also tell us
      that the Sun became activated for short periods, every 1470 years,
      throughout the entire glaciation period. The periodic re-warming
      may have prevented the Earth from freezing up completely.<br>
      <br>
      The inactive periods of the Sun were nevertheless long enough to
      create the huge cooling on earth that lays up ice sheets across
      the northern hemisphere more than 10,000 feet deep, which are
      known to have existed.<br>
      <br>
      It is here, that the theoretical becomes important for us all in a
      critical practical manner. The present trends suggest that the
      turn-off transition that makes the Sun inactive, might be upon us
      in 30 to 50 years time. When this happens the entire world will
      have to live with a dimmer Sun on a colder earth. Of course this
      poses some challenges for maintaining our food supply.<br>
      <br>
      The chlorophyll in plants will have to function at reduced energy
      levels and with a shifted radiation spectrum.<br>
      <br>
      Here a great challenge arises for humanity as a whole, to work
      together to create infrastructures that are needed to maintain our
      food supply in the coming dimmer and colder world. While it is
      technologically and economically possible to meet this challenge,
      the question remains whether we will do what is needed to maintain
      our existence?<br>
      <br>
      The wide range of considerations that come into focus in the
      context of the dimming Sun, evidently determines the topics that
      this video is focusing on. The video focuses on the theories and
      the evidences, and how they will impact us all when the changing
      conditions unfold as expected. And at the end, the video will also
      focus on the dimension of our response to the expected conditions.
      This remains presently the biggest open question of them
      all.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      <b>The effect of the Primer Fields on the Sun</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The shape of the galaxy shown here illustrates to some degree, in
      principle, the shape of the plasma environment in our solar
      system, though the density in the solar system is presently too
      low for the organizing plasma streams to be seen.<br>
      <br>
      However, by replicating the shaping process in the very small, in
      the laboratory environment, we can explore the forces that shape
      these types of phenomena.<br>
      <br>
      David LaPoint discovered in laboratory experiments that the Primer
      Fields, when they exist and are functioning, physically prime the
      environment of the solar system with a densely compressed sphere
      of plasma centered on our Sun. <br>
      <br>
      The principle is illustrated here.<br>
      <br>
      The effects, however, that David LaPoint discovered, are so
      amazingly critical that great problems arise for humanity when
      their functioning is impeded or is collapsing.<br>
      <br>
      The evidence tells us that the dense plasma environment that is
      focused on the center of the solar system enables our Sun to be
      electrically powered from the outside by electric arc reactions.
      In these reactions the condensed plasma interacts with the Sun's
      photosphere.<br>
      <br>
      The condensing process is a multi-stage process that is
      illustrated to some degree in the Red Square nebula. The nebula is
      not the remnant of an exploding star as nebulas are often
      regarded. Instead it is an example of the typical features of the
      Primer Fields in operation. The fields form by the principles
      inherent in the flow of electric plasma in space. The details will
      be discussed later, though the overall effect is noteworthy here.
      The effect of the fields is that plasma streams that exist in
      galactic space in wide channels, becomes drawn together, like by a
      wide funnel, and becomes magnetically focused from the funnel onto
      a central sun, or a system of multiples suns that become intensely
      powered by this process. The planets exist outside of this densely
      powered sphere, on an ecliptic centerd on the Sun, between the two
      Primer Field structures. The plasma concentration process that we
      see in operation here, which is basically the same for every sun,
      renders our Sun as an intensely powered catalytic energy
      converter, that is powered not from within, but is powered
      externally at its surface.<br>
      <br>
      The evidence that the Sun is externally powered is fairly obvious.
      When we look beneath the high-powered photosphere, through the
      open space at the umbra of the sunspots, the Sun reveals itself as
      being much darker, and therefore cooler inside. The photosphere
      has been measured at a whopping 5,870 degrees Kelvin, and the
      surface below at a mere 3,000 degrees. This means that the Sun's
      great brilliance is electrically generated at its very surface and
      does not emanate from within from nuclear fusion reactions as it
      is generally believed.<br>
      <br>
      The plasma concentration process that enables a sun to be
      electrically powered, has been replicated in lab experiments.
      There a highly compressed plasma sphere was formed in a thinly
      filled chamber of gas between two bowl-type permanent magnets that
      replicate the functional elements of the Primer Fields. <br>
      <br>
      The result, which is shown here, was develop by the functions of
      the magnetic fields acting on the plasma flow to concentrate it.<br>
      <br>
      It is interesting to note that in the lab experiment the plasma
      sphere at the center did not form instantly. The operating
      environment needed to be established first.<br>
      <br>
      However, in the real world this establishing-function also
      includes the forming of the bowl-shaped magnetic fields themselves
      by which the plasma becomes concentrated. In the lab, the magnetic
      fields were provided with manufactured magnets. In the real world
      the bowl-shaped magnetic fields are electrically created
      structures that are formed by moving electricity in plasma
      streams.<br>
      <br>
      This means that the plasma sphere in which our sun is located, is
      the composite result of complex processes working together, for
      which a certain level of plasma input density is required for the
      forming of the magnetic bowl structures to happen. <br>
      <br>
      I will illustrate later how the bowl-shaped magnetic structures
      are formed, that furnish the Primer Fields, which in turn create
      the conditions that focus plasma onto our Sun that lights it up to
      great brilliance.<br>
      <br>
      It has become evident in lab experiments that when the input
      density of the plasma streams that feed into the system drops
      below a certain minimum threshold, the critical fields can no
      longer be maintained. They simply collapse, whereby the entire
      process stops. When this collapse happens in the real world, the
      brilliant photosphere of our sun is no longer being powered. It
      becomes in effect, turned off. It fades into a thin haze, leaving
      in the wake a colder, darker, yellow sun that glows dimly by its
      internally stored-up energy like ambers of a fire gone out, which
      too, then slowly diminish. <br>
      <br>
      This means that the transition to the next ice age will not be a
      slow process that is drawn out over thousands of years, but will
      be a radical turn-off transition in which the Sun grows dim in
      possibly a single day. <br>
      <br>
      There exists plenty of evidence in ice core samples that the kind
      of rapid transformation of the climate on earth has happened that
      reflects an on-off transition, from an active Sun, to a
      deactivated Sun. <br>
      <br>
      Nothing short of such a radical transition can explain the
      massive, rapid cooling that occurred when the last Ice Age began
      120,000 years ago.<br>
      <br>
      It takes a massive reduction in solar energy input into the
      Earth's climate to cause the formation of the enormous ice sheets
      that become spread across much of the northern hemisphere as it is
      shown here, which piled up 10,000 feet thick, or more in some
      places.<br>
      <br>
      When the input plasma streams for the solar system diminish below
      the cut-off threshold where the Sun turns off, a radically
      different world unfolds. The actual timeframe in which the
      collapse of the climate follows may be extremely short, probably
      spanning less than a single year for all practical purposes. <br>
      <br>
      We are presently near the cut-off point. We have come to the end
      phase of the actively powered period of the sun, and the beginning
      of the next 90,000-year glaciation period. <br>
      <br>
      Of course we don't know the precise day or year at which the
      Primer Fields will collapse and the plasma sphere around the Sun
      will vanish, but do we really need to know this. We know already
      enough to be inspired to take the appropriate actions to build new
      infrastructures for our food supply and for our living. We know
      with measured evidence on hand that the Earth has been in a
      diminishing trend for 3,000 years already, that appears to be now
      accelerating towards the critical cut-off point. <br>
      <br>
      We also know that when the Sun's powered state ends, that is when
      it gets turned off to a lower intensity state, the big ice sheets
      will form. It takes a big change in the incoming energy that warms
      our planet, for big effects to happen.<br>
      <br>
      Let's hope that the cut-off point that we are moving towards is
      still more distant in time than it appears to be, because at the
      present time no one of humanity is prepared for the consequences.
      <br>
      <br>
      Not the least preparations are even considered to be made, much
      less are made, even while the consequences, when they begin,
      promise to be far bigger than most people dare yet to imagine.<br>
      <br>
      <b>The Digital Ice Age</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      At the beginning of the last Ice Age the temperature derived from
      ice core samples in North Greenland dropped off steeply to about
      the mid-point of the deep glaciation level. This made the Earth
      about 20 times colder than the Little Ice Age had been. <br>
      <br>
      However, the sharp drop-off doesn't show up in ice core samples
      drilled from the ice in Antarctica, nor do the rapid oscillations
      show up that span the entire glaciation period, which are clearly
      evident in the Greenland ice core samples. <br>
      <br>
      Does this mean that the rapid oscillations did not occur, or might
      be local occurrences? It is tempting to assume this, because
      without the Primer Fields theory that makes it rather plain that
      the Sun can rapidly alternate between on and off states, it is
      almost impossible to explain the large and fast climate
      oscillations that the Greenland ice core samples tell us of. <br>
      <br>
      But with the Primer Fields theory considered, the enigma resolves
      into simply a series of events in which the Sun is actively
      powered for a brief span, followed by a longer span of the Sun
      becoming inactive again. <br>
      <br>
      The Greenland ice is much more sensitive, and able to preserve
      these fast fluctuations, than the ice in Antarctica. <br>
      <br>
      Antarctica, being an ice desert, one of the driest spots on earth,
      it would be naturally less responsive to short-term variations of
      the type that we would expect to see when the Sun switches from
      its powered state to its non-powered state, where it shines only
      'dimly' with its internally stored up energy. <br>
      <br>
      The type of rapid fluctuation that would be indicative of on-off
      transitions of the Sun would evidently be more strongly apparent
      in the ice core samples drilled from the ice sheets in Greenland,
      which is far from being a desert. <br>
      <br>
      The temperature record that is shown here is from the North
      Greenland project where the temperature range gleamed from the ice
      samples is several times larger than the equivalent in Antarctica.
      In both cases the temperature gradient is gleamed from the ratio
      of the heavy oxygen isotope O18 in the air. This ratio is
      temperature sensitive. Colder temperatures produce a greater
      concentration of O18.<br>
      <br>
      The baseline concentrations also vary somewhat between the
      drilling sites, both in Antarctica and in Greenland, but show the
      same pattern. What we see in the Greenland patterns presents
      strong evidence of the type that one would expect for solar on-off
      conditions, of which the Antarctic ice shows only the washed out
      major trends.<br>
      <br>
      The rapid fluctuations that are detected in the Greenland ice, are
      called the Dansgaard Oeschger oscillations. These are transitions
      from deep glaciation conditions, almost all the way back to
      interglacial conditions.<br>
      <br>
      These are enormous fluctuations. They tell us that the Earth
      heated up from full ice age conditions to near interglacial
      temperatures in twenty to thirty years, and then cooled down
      again, gradually, to deep glaciation conditions, in a few hundred
      years. This rapid warming, and gradual cooling, is evident in all
      of the big Dansgaard Oeschger oscillations. All told, 25 of these
      big fluctuations have been recognized.<br>
      <br>
      In some cases where the interval is long - where the gradual
      cooling spans a longer period - we see evidence of small, sharp,
      upwards spikes along the way, suggesting that numerous short
      bursts of the powered state of the Sun have occurred that have
      caused a periodic re-warming of the Earth, and also of the Sun
      itself, internally.<br>
      <br>
      The evidence suggests that the last entire ice age, and those
      before, were created by a long series of the power-off state of
      the Sun interspersed with short periods of the Sun being fully
      powered. It appears that whenever the Primer Fields are
      established, the Sun is actively powered to roughly its full
      potential, and that both the Sun and the Earth cool down during
      the longer powered-off periods.<br>
      <br>
      It may seem irrational to assume that such a giant system, as that
      which feeds our sun, can turn on or off in the space of the day.
      However, in electric systems, such rapid transitions are totally
      natural and are readily observed in the natural environment. When
      storm clouds reach high into the atmosphere, an electric field
      becomes established at times that extends into the stratosphere
      and causes a plasma-flow connection. When this happens the basic
      pattern of the Primer Fields appear in the sky. They flicker on
      strongly in the shape of giant red sprites, and then vanish just
      as fast. They rarely last for more than a second. The Primer
      Fields that activate our Sun, evidently can 'flicker' on and off
      in a similar rapid manner.<br>
      <br>
      What we see in the resulting relationship between the on-and-off
      periods for our Sun has an enormous impact on what will happen to
      the agriculture that we depend on, the moment that the turn-off
      happens that marks the start of the next Ice Age. While we may see
      a gradual cooling of the climate of the Earth after the Sun turns
      off, the effect of the cooler Sun will have an immediate impact on
      agriculture. Not only will there be radically less energy
      available for the chlorophyll of the green plants to function, but
      the radiation spectrum will also shift away from the wavelengths
      of the visible light that are critical for the absorption by
      chlorophyll, without which plants cannot grow. <br>
      <br>
      When the Sun turns off, we will see an immediate 70% reduction of
      the total energy coming from the Sun, and an immediate shift of
      the energy profile towards the red. We can compensate for the
      energy loss by placing our agriculture into the tropics, enhanced
      with artificial lighting, and by placing some parts of it directly
      into indoor facilities with 100% artificial environments.<br>
      <br>
      While the Sun becoming inactive poses some challenges, the
      challenges are not insurmountable. As you can see, both types of
      chlorophyll get most of their energy from the shorter wavelengths
      below 500 manometers, which the Sun provides even less of when it
      dims down. However, since the absorption spectrum of chlorophyll
      is narrow and specific, only small amounts of energy are required
      when the lighting is tuned to the absorption bands. At the present
      time, only 2% of the solar energy received is actually utilized by
      the plants. The entire amount then, can be provided with relative
      ease with the use of nuclear or more advanced types of electric
      power systems.<br>
      <br>
      This means that when the Sun enters its off-state, that is its
      inactive residual heat-state, the remaining sunlight will be
      essentially useless for most types of agriculture existing today.
      This means that all the new agricultural platforms that need to be
      built to maintain our food supply, will have to be in place and be
      operating, before the day the Sun becomes inactive. This is the
      new reality. The transformation of the Earth will happen almost
      'instantly,' possibly in the span of just a single day, or less. <br>
      <br>
      When the solar off-transition happens, and it will happen, all of
      the temperate-zone agriculture, where presently nearly all of the
      world's food is produced, will be 'instantly' disabled. The
      transition won't happen gradually. It will happen 'instantly.' It
      will happen without warning. And when it happens, the consequences
      will begin immediately, on the very day. That's what we have to be
      ready for. That's what we must prepare for. The larger climate
      transition that unfolds along the way, in which the snows no
      longer melt, but increase, as big as this will all be, will
      actually be of lesser importance then. <br>
      <br>
      The impending ice age transition thus forces us to begin the
      greatest world development ever imagined, and to do this on a
      gigantic scale, like placing 90% of the world's agriculture afloat
      on the equatorial seas, all connected by floating bridges, and it
      being serviced by a new society living in floating cities along
      the way.<br>
      <br>
      The requirements that we must meet for the future, demand us to
      start a new age of automated industrial production in the present
      - this means now and without fail - utilizing nuclear-powered
      high-temperature processes with the use of basalt as the
      feedstock. Basalt is none-corrosive and is lighter and stronger
      than steel, and is infinitely available. This also means that
      houses must be produced in automated industries, where they are
      produced at such a low cost in efforts that they can be given away
      for free as a part of the new infrastructures for living that must
      be produced, for the human journey to continue during the long
      nights of deep glaciation.<br>
      <br>
      If no preparations are made that compensate for the loss of the
      traditional food supply that results from the instant
      transformation of our planet when the Sun turns off, then most of
      humanity will simply starve to death. This isn't something to aim
      for, is it?<br>
      <br>
      For this reason the floating agriculture will be built, with
      enhanced lighting, complete with floating cities to service them.
      These things will happen, because if we fail, the resulting effect
      will be worse than the effect of a nuclear war. The present global
      food reserves won't last for no longer than just a few months. It
      won't be a pleasant thing to watch seven billion people to starve
      to death. Only a few million made it through the last glaciation
      cycle alive. <br>
      <br>
      We want to do far better this time around. And we will do better.
      The Primer Fields theory opens the door to understanding what we
      are up against, and what we must prepare for. This gives us an
      advantage that did not exist in the earlier times, but which
      exists now for the first time in the entire history of life on our
      planet. Likewise the technological power exists for this to
      happen, which makes it possible for the first time too, to build
      the infrastructures that we require to 'weather' an ice age with.<br>
      <br>
      To get there, our entire civilization will likely have to be
      rebuilt and set afloat in the tropics where land is scarce. This
      will happen. Shifting our agriculture into the tropics, where the
      sunlight is the strongest, will offset the early portion of the
      loss of the solar energy as the Sun is powered off. Some form of
      minimal artificial lighting will likely have to be added, and
      artificial climate control will likely have to be added even in
      the tropics, together with increased CO2 concentrations for
      increased plant growth. <br>
      <br>
      These infrastructures will require some extensive scientific
      advances in plant biology and in physical engineering technology
      for the floating new environments, and the whole thing will have
      to be in place, and the infrastructures be operational, without
      fail, before the transition happens. This means we should get
      started now. We still have a chance to get this critical work
      done. We better not waste this chance before us, by doing
      nothing.. It may be our last chance.<br>
      <br>
      The ice age transition will happen without fail. We can count on
      that. We are close to the transition to the next deep glaciation
      to begin, though we don't know how close, close is.<br>
      <br>
      We also know that the trend towards the next glaciation has been
      progressing for 3000 years already, and is accelerating. We don't
      know exactly where the cut-off level is, beyond which the Primer
      Fields collapse and the Sun turns off. It may not be far below the
      level of the Little Ice Age. At the present trend, we may get to
      this point in twenty or thirty years, or fifty at the most. <br>
      <br>
      NASA's Ulysses spacecraft saw a 30% reduction in the solar wind
      pressure happening in just a single decade. That's not a small
      drop-off. And the trend is continuing. If our agriculture has not
      been transferred to the tropics before the high-power solar system
      stops, its game-over for humanity. Humanity will likely become
      extinct then, by the lack of food, except for a minuscule remnant
      of a few million that might escape the universal death. If death
      by starvation is what you wish for yourself and your children,
      then sit back and do nothing, because that way your desired fate
      will be assured with great certainty.<br>
      <br>
      The stepping away from this fate begins with the recognition that
      our Sun would not be the brilliant life-giving 'fire' in the sky
      without a dense plasma sphere surrounding it from which it draws
      its electric power that lights up its photosphere with electric
      plasma interaction. <br>
      <br>
      If this realization is made, half the battle is won, because
      everything follows, and the needed steps become logical. And this
      realization shouldn't be hard to make.<br>
      <br>
      It has been recognized a long time ago that our Sun is not the
      steady state nuclear fusion furnace, which it is widely said to
      be, but is powered by one of the vast networks of plasma streams
      that pervade the galaxies and the cosmos as a whole. Since plasma
      has mass, the plasma surrounding the Sun becomes attracted by the
      Sun's gravity and interacts with its outer atmosphere, the
      photosphere, which thereby becomes excited to 5,780 degrees
      Kelvin. It is that simple. <br>
      <br>
      The Primer Fields prime the environment in which the simple
      process unfolds for as long as the fields exist. Once you realize
      that this presently operating system will vanish in the near
      future, and that solutions are possible for humanity to move
      forward in spite of the dimmer Sun, you may become inspired
      thereby to get out of the easy chair to gain a fuller
      understanding of how the critical process operates on which your
      continued existence depends. <br>
      <br>
      <b>The Primer Fields dynamics</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The plasma physicist David LaPoint suggests that there is much
      more to the Primer Fields dynamics than what meets the eye. He
      suggests that our sun operates within a sphere of highly
      concentrated plasma that is generated by powerful magnetic fields,
      which he calls the " Primer Fields," and that the plasma sphere
      around the Sun is magnetically confined by these fields.<br>
      <br>
      If this was not so, our sun would be but a dim speck in the sky,
      without the large magnetic fields acting on it that surround it
      with a sphere of concentrated plasma. The Earth would be a cold
      planet then, extensively covered with ice, as it once was 700
      million years ago. But is David LaPoint correct? Do they Primer
      Fields really exist outside the laboratory environment? Can they
      be seen? And if they do exist and are visible, is it possible for
      these vital fields to collapse?<br>
      <br>
      So, let's explore what stands behind it all.<br>
      <br>
      The key component of the Primer Fields theory is the existence of
      one or two bowl shaped electromagnetic fields. David LaPoint uses
      two bowl-shaped magnets of opposite magnetic polarity for his
      experiments conducted in a vacuum chamber.<br>
      <br>
      In the environment of space, however, no bowl-shaped magnets hang
      in the sky. For the required magnetic fields to exist, they must
      be generated by the natural phenomenon of electricity flowing as
      plasma in space. And this is exactly what happens.<br>
      <br>
      The term, plasma, refers to electrically charged particles that
      exist in free flowing form in space, primarily as protons and
      electrons, the stuff that atoms become made of when they are bound
      together. In space they are free flowing. However, flowing
      electricity creates magnetic fields, and by these fields the
      flowing electricity becomes pinched together.<br>
      <br>
      When electricity is carried by two parallel wires, with the
      current flowing in the same direction, the wires are attracted to
      each other by the Lorentz force. The same happens in plasma in
      space where electricity is flowing freely without wires. Here the
      effect is called the Zeta Pinch effect. <br>
      <br>
      In space the flowing electric plasma particles are drawn to each
      other by the same magnetic forces that attract wires to each
      other. However while the wires remain physically fixed, plasma
      currents in space become compressed into ever-smaller magnetic
      confinement. By the confinement the current density is increased,
      which in turn pinches the plasma currents still tighter and
      tighter, forming a bowl-shaped magnetic field in the process at
      the very end of the pinched plasma stream. <br>
      <br>
      But something happens in the bowl when the plasma currents exceed
      a critical limit, as they converge to ever-tighter confinement.
      The currents and the resulting magnetic fields become unstable by
      the pinch effect, past a critical point. The currents become
      'twisted into complex knots' whereby the bowl-shaped magnetic
      field that forms, opens up at the center. There, below the
      opening, an electromagneticly confined 'high-density' plasma
      stream is formed by a number of interacting effects. <br>
      <br>
      On the platform of the Primer Fields the entire structure that we
      see that extends across 50 kilometers from top to bottom, forms in
      a fraction of a second. Typically the sprite remains active for
      about a single second, until the plasma flow becomes too weak to
      maintain the Primer Fields. At the point when the Primer Fields
      collapse, the entire structure simply vanishes.<br>
      <br>
      In comparing the sprite with the larger scale of the solar system,
      the sprite's one second active time is comparable to the solar
      system's interglacial period of the Sun's active time of roughly
      12,000 years. The on-off process is the same in both cases, though
      different in scale. <br>
      <br>
      Let me illustrate now how the process functions that forms the
      Primer Fields. This is best illustrated by looking at another lab
      experiment, that is carried out with an instrument called the,
      Dense Plasma Focus Device. <br>
      <br>
      The device is made up of a ring of electrodes that surround a
      hollow electrode at the center.<br>
      <br>
      When an electric field is applied, a plasma sheet forms.<br>
      <br>
      The plasma sheet is instantly drawn towards the opening of the
      central electrode, and is then drawn into it.<br>
      <br>
      By it being drawn into the opening, the plasma becomes extremely
      pinched together.<br>
      <br>
      There, it becomes unstable and begins to twist.<br>
      <br>
      At first, the plasma twists itself into a spiral.<br>
      <br>
      The more it becomes compacted the more unstable the spiral
      becomes, and becomes twisted.<br>
      <br>
      Eventually, the twisting forms a complex knot.<br>
      <br>
      The illustrations are snapshots taken from a video about the Dense
      Plasma Focus Device. <br>
      <br>
      In space the plasma instabilities that form the complex knots open
      the magnetic bowls that form at the end of the concentrated plasma
      currents. As the process unfolds further, a high-density plasma
      concentration forms outside of the magnetic holes. That's where
      the sun is located in a solar system and is powered thereby.<br>
      <br>
      When, however, the plasma streams are too weak to cause an extreme
      pinch effect to happen, the plasma streams simply flow through the
      solar system without activating anything. The Sun thereby remains
      dim and not actively powered.<br>
      <br>
      When the Sun is powered by a dense plasma sphere surrounding it,
      the flow-through process still happens. Plasma flows out of the
      plasma sphere, since the Sun utilizes only a small portion of it.
      In the outflow another magnetic field is generated, but with the
      opposite polarity. The evidence suggests that all large
      electromagnetic structures that exist in space, when they are
      drawn to a sun, or on the larger scale to a galaxy, whereby the
      Primer Fields form, exist typically in complementary pairs.<br>
      <br>
      Between the two giant complementary electromagnetic bowls, a
      number of interesting effects come to light with interesting
      principles that are critical for the overall dynamic interactions.
      <br>
      <br>
      The magnetic fields are the strongest at the focal point of the
      bowl-shaped magnetic structures. In the narrow space between the
      two complementary structures lies typically a solar system with a
      sun, or several suns, on the central axis, and with the planets
      orbiting on a thin ecliptic plain in the space between the two
      electromagnetic bowl-type fields.<br>
      <br>
      While the two bowl-type electromagnetic fields are each separate
      entities, they work together functionally as a whole.<br>
      <br>
      Their function is to concentrate the plasma flows that pervade all
      space and focus them into a tightly confined sphere in which our
      sun is located and is powered by it. <br>
      <br>
      The remarkable concentration is accomplished in the laboratory by
      a set of two bowl-type structures, shown in red and blue, facing
      one-another with opposite (complementary) polarities. <br>
      <br>
      The small point in the middle between the two magnetic bowl
      structures is where a polarity flip point is located. The flip
      point appears to be responsible for flipping the polarity of the
      Sun's magnetic field with every solar cycle.<br>
      <br>
      The location of the flip point moves slightly when one of the two
      bowl structures becomes weaker than the other. This effect causes
      the polarity of the magnetic field of the Sun to assume the
      dominant polarity, and thus flip with the 11-year solar cycles
      that are simply resonance cycles between the complementary
      magnetic structures. <br>
      <br>
      The plasma concentration that is required for the Sun to function
      is dynamically produced in the illustrated structure by the
      interaction of its three functional magnetic elements that are
      structured around the respective hole in the magnetic bowls.<br>
      <br>
      Each of the three structures has a specific function to fulfill.
      The flip ring flips the orientation of plasma. It flips it under
      the magnetic confinement dome, while the choke ring below helps to
      keep it there.<br>
      <br>
      The plasma particles that flow into the big red bowl are flipped
      upwards as they pass the flip ring (yellow). They are collected
      together there into a massive accumulation. The plasma particles
      become concentrated by this process. The concentration creates a
      'high-pressure' environment.<br>
      <br>
      The magnetic choke ring, within the opening of the magnetic bowl,
      focuses the 'escaping' plasma flow into a tightly concentrated
      stream beneath the hole. In some lab experiments, the focused
      stream expands into a sphere.<br>
      <br>
      When plasma is drawn out of the sphere in the flow-through
      process, a complementary bowl structure is formed with opposite
      orientation and opposite magnetic polarity. In this structure the
      out-flowing stream of lesser density is drawn into the bowls where
      expands in the reverse process, reverting back to the 'normal'
      density of the prevailing plasma stream. <br>
      <br>
      The process that is illustrated here can be verified with
      laboratory experiments.<br>
      <br>
      In a high-power plasma experiment of the type that is conducted at
      the Los Alamos National Laboratory, the complementary bowl
      structure that the plasma currents form by their own interaction,
      is clearly visible. Also the containment dome that forms inside
      the bowls is visible in the experiment that is illustrated here.<br>
      <br>
      In this particular experiment the magnetically focused plasma
      stream that flows between the bowls, did not form a sphere, for
      which a catalyst would be required, but it did form a distinct
      plasma ring around the focused stream, centered between the bowls.<br>
      <br>
      Evidence exists that the lab-created shape of plasma formed by the
      Primer Fields, was visible in ancient time in the sky. Archetypal
      drawings collected from widely separated regions on earth, show a
      remarkable similarity of their design with the lab-created plasma
      formations. The similarity suggests that the complementary plasma
      bowl shapes were common occurrences at one time, appearing and
      disappearing in the skies like so many UFO sightings today, or
      like the sprites still do under special conditions.<br>
      <br>
      David LaPoint also discovered two more features of the Primer
      Fields, for which widely known evidence exists, which are the
      plasma jets and the magnetic flip point. He discovered that when
      the plasma pressure under the confinement dome becomes too great,
      the dome will rupture at its weakest point, by which excess plasma
      escapes in a burst until the rift closes up again under the
      resulting lower pressure. By this plasma venting process the
      magnetic strength of the respective bowl structure weakens
      somewhat. The resulting imbalance shifts the convergence of the
      magnetic fields, and with it it shifts a magnetic flip point that
      David LaPoint also discovered, forms below the opening of the
      magnetic bowl. <br>
      <br>
      In the case of the solar system the resulting imbalance, which
      shifts the flip point, flips the Sun's magnetic field at the high
      point of the 11-year solar cycles are thereby recognized to be
      simply resonance cycles that oscillate between the two
      complementary electromagnetic structures of the solar system. <br>
      <br>
      What the complete Primer Fields system that powers our solar
      system and the sun may look like in practice, can be seen
      illustrated in the operation of the Red Square Nebula that can
      serve as a model for this purpose. In this model we see all the
      essential features of the Primer Fields system clearly visible. <br>
      <br>
      We see the two complementary bowl-type structures in operation.
      One concentrates the galactic plasma streams like a funnel. In the
      funnel we can see the flip ring, and below it the choke ring,
      below which a cone of concentrated plasma extends that focuses
      onto a sun, or a number of them. And we see the reverse happening
      for the outgoing plasma stream. <br>
      <br>
      We can see all the essential features reflected here that have
      been observed in a laboratory plasma-flow experiment. <br>
      <br>
      Our galaxy, when it is observed as a whole, also operates on
      essentially the same dynamic platform, though on a vastly larger
      scale than a solar system. But here too, we see unmistakable
      evidence of two complementary electromagnetic bowls that form
      highly condensed plasma concentrations under their respective
      confinement domes. The concentration is visible in x-ray and
      gamma-ray emissions. We can also see the the extremely
      concentrated plasma sphere below the confinement domes and between
      the two bowl structures that are indicated by the existence of the
      confinement domes. The concentrated plasma sphere is also the
      center of the galaxy. <br>
      <br>
      Large intergalactic plasma streams feed into and out of the Primer
      Fields that form the confinement domes. These two long
      intergalactic connecting streams, one incoming and one out-going,
      both have very long resonance cycles. These very long electric
      resonance cycles that correspond to the long distances between the
      galaxies, evidently affect the strength of the Primer Fields that
      power the galaxy, and are thereby the cause for the two long
      climate cycles that have been observed on Earth.<br>
      <br>
      These very long electric resonance cycles - the sixty-two million
      year cycle, and the hundred-forty million year cycle - show up as
      long climate cycles that have been preserved in sediment records
      that enable us to look back in time more than 500 million years. <br>
      <br>
      Presently, the two very long climate cycles are both near their
      minimum point, whereby the weak plasma conditions have been
      created that have gripped the Earth for the last two million
      years, in which the ice ages happened.<br>
      <br>
      During these weak conditions that have been slowly developing for
      the last five million years, which are getting still weaker, the
      breakdown of the Primer Fields that power our solar system has
      become a regular occurrence during the weakest times. <br>
      <br>
      Then, when the plasma streams that flow through the solar system
      become so weak that they drop below a threshold, a point is
      reached when the pinch effect in the plasma streams is no longer
      strong enough to twist the plasma currents into knots to create
      the bowl-type magnetic structures with the void at the center that
      make up the Primer Fields. And so the Primer Fields cannot form.
      What once existed, suddenly exists no more. <br>
      <br>
      The plasma currents become no longer concentrated then, but simply
      flow through the solar system without becoming focused around the
      Sun.<br>
      <br>
      At this point the Sun simply turns off. It becomes inactive, dim,
      and cold. An Ice Age begins. <br>
      <br>
      The ice ages didn't last as long in the earlier phase of the
      weakening conditions. They lasted only 41,000 years then. As the
      general weakening continued, the 100,000 years long ice ages
      began. This became named the Pleistocene Epoch.<br>
      <br>
      Throughout the ice ages, in which the Primer Fields fail, the Sun
      becomes inactive for long periods. It becomes a dim yellow star
      that glows mostly by its stored up energy and whatever nuclear
      decay may be ongoing within it.<br>
      <br>
      However, evidence exists that the Sun remains not totally shut
      down during the long ice age glaciation periods, which typically
      last 100,000 years. The Earth would turn into a snowball if the
      Sun would remain inactive for 100,000 years. Fortunately, this
      doesn't happen. Periodically short pulses of high-density
      conditions do occur during the ice ages, which re-invigorate the
      plasma streams that enable the Primer Fields to form anew, whereby
      the Sun to becomes powered again. Unfortunately these pulses are
      short in duration. The Sun remains powered by these pulses for
      only a few decades, and then turns off again. <br>
      <br>
      Evidence exists that these pulses occurred on a fairly regular
      basis. Their occurrence has created large climate oscillations.
      Evidence has been detected in ice core samples drilled from the
      Greenland ice sheets that these short periods when the Sun becomes
      active again, have occurred in intervals of 1470 years. The
      resulting oscillations have been named, the Dansgaard-Oeschger
      oscillations.<br>
      <br>
      <b>The Dansgaard Oeschger oscillations</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      During the extremely weak conditions in the galaxy that enable the
      ice ages on earth, the Sun remains constantly active only during
      the timeframe of the interglacial pulses. In this timeframe the
      solar system is in its high-power mode. During the long glacial
      periods, between these pulses, the Dansgaard-Oeschger oscillations
      in which the Sun turns on and off, rule the scene and determine
      the climate. That's when we see the large fluctuations happening
      that prevent the Earth from freezing up completely.<br>
      <br>
      Researchers have identified 25 major Dansgaard-Oeschger pulses,
      spaced 1470 years on average. Since these pulses become
      significant during the low-power environments, they can serve as
      points of reference for determining the next potential cut-off
      point for the Primer Fields, and with them the powered Sun.<br>
      <br>
      We can make a reasonable determination by looking at the last
      three of the Dansgaard-Oeschger events that occurred at the end of
      the most recent Ice Age.<br>
      <br>
      We see evidence of three such events there, spaced 1470 years
      apart. The first started with a major upswing, followed by a down
      slope. The second event started on the down slope, but was of
      short duration. The last upswing was much larger again, and it
      didn't collapse this time.<br>
      <br>
      If we run the clock forward from these three steps, in steps of
      1470 years, then the most recent Dansgaard-Oeschger event should
      have occurred roughly two to three hundred years ago. This happens
      to be the point in time where we see the Little Ice Age ending. <br>
      <br>
      With this coincidence, a high probability exists that the warming
      of the world that broke us out of the Little Ice Age may have been
      a Dansgaard-Oeschger event. If this is so, a Dansgaard-Oeschger
      pulse may have saved civilization, and humanity with it, by
      preventing the collapse of the climate from the Little Ice Age
      into the big one.<br>
      <br>
      The previous Dansgaard-Oeschger event, which occurred 1470 years
      earlier, takes us back to 1670 years before the present. This
      earlier pulse had ended steeply. If the current Dansgaard-Oeschger
      pulse ends in the same manner as the previous one, humanity will
      be in deep trouble, because nothing has been prepared for the kind
      of world we will then have to live in. <br>
      <br>
      Unfortunately we like to play fantasy games, such as the global
      warming game, instead of being concerned with what is really going
      on.<br>
      <br>
      This means that all the global warming hoopla that was started in
      the 1970s, was essentially a fairy tale spun around an
      astrophysical Dansgaard-Oeschger event that was in progress at the
      time and was beginning to peak in the 1970s. <br>
      <br>
      Let's hope that the currently weakening electric environment will
      remain sufficiently strong a bit longer, so that it will hold back
      the cut-off point for the Sun by at least a few more decades.
      These few extra decades would give us time to prepare the world
      for the dim and cold glacial environment that awaits us beyond the
      cut-off point of the powered Sun.<br>
      <br>
      The sunspot cycles are definitely getting weaker. By the current
      trend, the 25th solar cycle may not have any sunspots at all. The
      drop-off that we see happening here, may be the ending of the
      current Dansgaard-Oeschger pulse that had its beginning during the
      Little Ice Age. It then peaked in the 1950s through to the 1990s.<br>
      <br>
      The great danger of our time is that when the current
      Dansgaard-Oeschger pulse ends, there is nothing much left of the
      interglacial pulse either, so that a free-fall collapse may occur.
      The large re-warming events during the previous Ice Age that were
      caused by the Dansgaard-Oeschger pulses, were historically of
      short duration. How close we are to the current Dansgaard-Oeschger
      pulse ending, which appears to be driving the current climate,
      cannot be determined. The remaining time will likely be in the
      range of decades, seeing that the Sun is already on a weakening
      trend.<br>
      <br>
      <b>The UFO phenomenon</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The Dansgaard_Oeschger oscillations are just one type of example
      in which rapid on-off conditions are natural occurrences for
      electric plasma phenomena. The so-called UFO phenomenon is another
      example of the same type. <br>
      <br>
      Many cases of UFO 'sightings' have been reported. Many have been
      photographed. But note, what has been photographed conforms
      perfectly to the shape of the electromagnetic bowl-type structure
      that forms the Primer Fields that in turn form a sphere of
      concentrated plasma at their focal point. This happens also to be
      the typical shape that has been captured in UFO photographs. <br>
      <br>
      We see the bowl-type electromagnetic structure, and the plasma
      sphere at the focal point of it. Both are clearly evident in this
      photograph. Reports say that the UFOs suddenly appear, that they
      can stand still, and that they can move quickly. They are seen
      existing in space, and are even hovering above the moon. They can
      accelerate immensely fast in their movement, and make extremely
      sharp sudden turns. They can do all this, because the so-called
      UFOs are not space ships, but are electromagnetic phenomena that
      have no mass, which would impede such movements. They are merely
      shapes created by electromagnetic interaction of plasma flowing in
      the atmosphere, which can become visible in the atmosphere. Some
      are seen as moving points of light, even pulsating light, some
      appearing in groups. <br>
      <br>
      By being electric plasma concentrations, the UFO phenomena also
      reflect radio waves, whereby they are seen on radar. However, when
      aircraft are launched to intercept them, the electric field around
      the aircraft affects the field that forms the UFO, which thereby
      changes its position, or causes it to simply vanish. All this
      makes interception quite impossible.<br>
      <br>
      Of course interception is also impossible for reasons that no UFO
      craft do actually exist. Extraterrestrial visitors travelling in
      physical spacecraft to our planet would have to fly against all
      the known laws of the physical universe and time. It would take a
      spacecraft 12,000 years to reach the earth from our closest star,
      flying at a speed of 360,000 km per hour, which is roughly 30
      times the speed of the Apollo 11 flight to the moon, which might
      be the limit for spacecraft velocities against the plasma
      background in space. Exotic theories have been invented in
      attempts to side-step the physical limits and barriers, in order
      to support the UFO theory, while the obvious reality is being
      ignored.<br>
      <br>
      In real terms the UFO phenomenon stands as a simple example of
      electromagnetic structures that form in space with gigantic
      effects and in the atmosphere with minute effects, by the Primer
      Fields being created in electric plasma streams. <br>
      <br>
      The UFOs, thus, become comparable to the sprites that appear in
      the upper atmosphere. The resulting effects, of course, depend on
      the coincidence of conditions that enable them, which are
      inherently rare and fragile in nature, and are specific for the
      type of atmosphere in which they occur. When the conditions occur
      in the lower atmosphere, they often enable a number of small
      plasma events simultaneously, which then become seen as multiple
      UFO sightings.<br>
      <br>
      This fragility of the sprites and UFO events evidently also
      applies to the complex structures and magnetic fields that create
      the conditions for our Sun to be electrically powered, and for
      these conditions to form and to vanish. <br>
      <br>
      Both the UFO phenomenon and the Dansgaard_Oeschger oscillations
      illustrate to some degree how fragile the conditions inherently
      are that affect the powered state of our sun.<br>
      <br>
      The powered state of our Sun has actually become a rather rare
      occurrence during last two million years of the great ice ages. A
      few long periods with a constantly active Sun, called the
      interglacial periods, have interrupted the 'normal' dark and cold
      world of the long ice ages, that few people came through alive,
      where the climate conditions are fragile, depending on the
      Dansgaard_Oeschger events to occur every fifteen hundred years. <br>
      <br>
      This fragile nature that applies to our solar system, applies to
      the UFO phenomenon too. It is not coincidental, therefore, that
      the UFO sightings became more frequent from the 1950s on, through
      to the 1990s, when the current Dansgaard_Oeschger pulse peaked,
      whereby the solar activity became the strongest in recent time, in
      which the electric conditions on earth were likewise the
      strongest.<br>
      <br>
      With the electric environment around our Sun now getting rapidly
      weaker again, as the Ulysses satellite reported, we have entered a
      transition zone of extremely fragile conditions. <br>
      <br>
      The resulting critical warning that science affords us on this
      basis, unfortunately, is not precise to the day, but it is the
      best that scientific correlation of the numerous elements in the
      astrophysical arena can provide. The exact day for the Sun
      reverting to its unpowered state, which will disable our
      agriculture, cannot be determined. The evidence before us,
      presents nevertheless a strong case for us all to make extreme
      efforts towards building the vast new infrastructures that our
      continued existence on this planet WILL most certainly depend on.<br>
      <br>
      It is tempting to assume that only the far northern countries and
      regions, like Canada, Europe, Russia, and China, are affected by
      the coming ice age transition in which the Sun becomes inactive.
      This is a foolish assumption. When the Sun turns dim and the food
      supply is collapsing, the entire world is affected. Thus it
      becomes the task of humanity as a whole to build the
      infrastructures to protect human existence on this planet. Not to
      act decisively on this front amounts to committing universal
      suicide. The changing astrophysical environment that affects our
      world will affect everything. It affects even the magnitude of
      earthquakes. It is highly likely on this front too, that we
      haven't seen anything yet in terms of consequences, which of
      course we can avoid by placing our civilization afloat onto the
      sea.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Orbit dynamics of the planets </b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Evidence exists that the Sun will likely shed a major portion of
      its mass when its inactive state begins. It might eject as much as
      30% of its mass. <br>
      <br>
      A sun absorbs large amounts of mass in the form of plasma, during
      its actively powered state. The accumulation of plasma, which
      carries an electric charge, creates an internal electric pressure
      in the Sun. <br>
      <br>
      This internal pressure becomes released when the external
      high-pressure plasma environment around the Sun vanishes. Some
      evidence that this gigantic mass-ejection happens, is found in the
      orbits of the planets. <br>
      <br>
      At the present time the planets orbit at a mere 71% of the
      velocity that a stable orbit requires. This means that the Sun's
      gravitational attraction is presently 29% stronger than the
      centrifugal force of the planets in orbit. The large difference is
      evidently compensated for by the electromagnetic effects of the
      Primer Fields that maintain the orbits against the stronger
      gravity.<br>
      <br>
      In a lab experiment, non-magnetic steel balls were laid on a sheet
      of glass. They were drawn into a specific orbit around the center
      of two bowl-shaped magnets. The steel balls seen here are
      magnetically self-spacing. If they are disturbed and let go, they
      return to their magnetically determined positions. <br>
      <br>
      The experiment illustrates to some degree how the orbits of the
      planets are assisted magnetically.<br>
      <br>
      But during the long off-times during the ice ages, when the Primer
      Fields no longer exist, or exist only during the short periods of
      the Dansgaard_Oeschger warming events, the Sun's gravity would
      then have to be much weaker than it is today for the orbits to
      remain intact. Without the weaker solar gravity the orbits would
      collapse over time. The fact that the collapse of the orbits did
      not happen during the ice ages, indicates that the Sun's gravity
      was lower during its inactive time in which gravity alone
      determines the orbits of the planets, balanced against the
      centrifugal force generated by their orbital velocity. <br>
      <br>
      In order for stable orbits to be possible without magnetic
      existence, the Sun must have shed a large part of its mass, and
      its gravitational attraction with it; maybe up to 25%. <br>
      <br>
      This means that we will see enormously large mass ejections
      happening when the Primer Fields collapse that maintain presently
      a strong plasma pressure around the Sun, and thereby within the
      Sun.<br>
      <br>
      The plasma mass ejection will likely be strong at first when the
      external plasma pressure no longer exists. The Sun will then
      loose, probably quite rapidly, a large portion of the mass it has
      absorbed during the 12,000 years of its high-power conditions in
      the interglacial period.<br>
      <br>
      After the initial burst, the mass ejection will likely diminish
      exponentially over a span of several thousand years. <br>
      <br>
      The result will likely be the kind of phenomenon that in the
      fusion-sun theory is referred to as the 'red giant' stage of the
      Sun that is deemed to result from perceived hydrogen depletion,
      which is said to enable the assumed helium fusion phase. <br>
      <br>
      In real terms, the red giant stage is merely a plasma mass
      ejection event that results when the input power streams diminish
      below the threshold level where the Primer Fields collapse.<br>
      <br>
      Some of the mass-ejection events accumulate the ejected solar mass
      in large plasma fields that are termed planetary nebula. The more
      powerful mass-ejection events may rip a portion of a sun apart in
      extremely large electric stress explosions. These events are
      termed Super Nova events. In the fusion Sun theory, they are
      deemed to be star explosions. In the real universe they are
      nothing more than just mass-ejection events.<br>
      <br>
      For us, when the Sun's great mass ejection event begins in
      possibly 30 to 50 years from now, it won't be hugely cataclysmic
      in nature, no matter how large the event may appear from a
      distance, but it will result in major earthquakes and volcanic
      eruptions that we need to be prepared for.<br>
      <br>
      The Earth's magnetic field won't protect us then either, because
      it too, will likely have collapsed by then, with the collapse of
      the Primer Fields.<br>
      <br>
      The only real cataclysmic event that happens typically among aging
      stars, occurs when their accumulated mass becomes so great,
      especially during strong active periods, that the accumulation
      results in internal electric stress fracturing that breaks a sun
      up into two or more fragments that then form a binary, triple, and
      quadruple star system. <br>
      <br>
      According to a survey, singular star systems like our own, are
      actually a minority among stars. With our sun being a mediocre
      star, however, it is extremely unlikely that any type of electric
      stress fracturing will occur in our Sun, including during the
      coming ice age transition. <br>
      <br>
      Nevertheless we will see extremely large electric stress
      fracturing events occur on Earth in the form of earthquakes and
      volcanic eruptions, especially along the San Andreas Fault that is
      extremely stressed already. We would want to be far away from this
      area and be safely afloat on the oceans by then.<br>
      <br>
      The Sun is presently charged with plasma like a car tire is pumped
      up with air. When a car tire blows, its air bursts out. When the
      equivalent happens to the Sun, great showers of plasma will burst
      from it and hit the Earth and cause those electric-stress
      'explosions' that trigger earthquakes at unprecedented magnitudes
      that we must prepare for, before they happen. We have no historic
      records available of how large these events were that will happen
      again. The last transition to an ice age occurred 120,000 years
      ago, that only few may have survived.<br>
      <br>
      Our modern infrastructures and cities may not fare well. They may
      not be able to withstand the seismic forces that might be
      unleashed. We really don't know what this means, except that we
      should prepare for the worst. The changing astrophysical
      environment that causes our Sun to become inactive, may cause
      enormous seismic events as we have never seen before in all the
      millennia of what we call civilization. The building of floating
      cities and industries may prove to be the only safe path for
      humanity to survive the critical times ahead. <br>
      <br>
      It won't be easy, of course, to let go what we have built up over
      long periods, but this is what we may have to choose in order to
      protect our existence.<br>
      <br>
      However, on the wider horizon, the dark cloud that severely
      challenges our willingness to adapt ourselves to the changing
      environment before us, comes with a silver lining, or maybe even a
      golden lining, that is more valuable than anything that we have
      built and may have to let go. <br>
      <br>
      <b>The dawn of humanity, civilization, and God</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Our development into a highly advanced and capable species with
      creative and productive powers that no other form of life can
      equal, may have been made possible by one of the special
      conditions that exist on the Earth only during Ice Age
      environments. <br>
      <br>
      The development of the human species didn't happen until the ice
      age epoch began. The critical factor here, is the increased
      galactic cosmic radiation that results when the shielding effect
      of the heliosphere becomes disabled as the Primer Fields collapse.
      <br>
      <br>
      Without the Primer Fields, the solar heliosphere cannot exist,
      which is a sphere of plasma created by the solar winds that flow
      from the high-powered electric sun at the center. Without the
      heliospheric plasma shell surrounding our solar system, the full
      cosmic radiation flux then impacts the Earth. The increased
      cosmic-ray flux appears to aid neurological development and lesser
      biological functions, including plant biology. <br>
      <br>
      The universe thus has given us a great gift with the two distinct
      environments that together aid our development on all fronts. It
      has given us alternately, an environment for spiritual nourishment
      with high cosmic-ray flux, and another environment with a
      brilliant Sun for easy living. We appear to need both. It may be
      for this reason that the dawn of humanity did not begin until the
      required conditions were met.<br>
      <br>
      Those conditions didn't exist until the ice ages began. 'Cosmic
      rays' are not rays in the standard sense, like rays of light, but
      are high-energy electrons and protons in motion at upwards to the
      speed of light. With the cosmic-ray particles being electrically
      charged, they typically pass right through our body without
      damaging anything. However, as they path through us, they generate
      electric currents within our biological systems that appear to be
      beneficial for the high-level functioning of our body. They tend
      to facilitate critical functions like the air we breathe,
      according to intelligently arranged principles.<br>
      <br>
      Our biological and neurological systems, are extremely complex
      electric systems that evidently benefit from increased electric
      activity over long periods of time. Our cognitive, scientific, and
      what may be called, spiritual powers, appear to be derived from
      this high-level nourishment, which in turn may have enabled, and
      then aided, our continuing self-development as a high-level
      species.<br>
      <br>
      The interaction between cosmic-ray flux and human development is
      surprisingly evident already in the weak cosmic-ray environment of
      the interglacial period.<br>
      <br>
      The great developments in civilization have all began during cold
      periods when the cosmic-ray flux is denser than normal. <br>
      <br>
      In the cold periods the heliosphere tends to be weaker, which
      results from the weakening of the solar winds, which NASA's
      Ulysses satellite has given us an example of.<br>
      <br>
      For the same reason was the period of the Maunder Minimum in solar
      activity - where no sunspots have occurred - which is coincident
      with the Little Ice Age - a period in which enormous scientific
      and cultural development occurred. This period of high cosmic-ray
      flux gave us the greatest peace treaty of all times, the Treaty of
      Westphalia that still stands as the foundation for civilization.
      This period also gave us great musical geniuses and scientific
      geniuses.<br>
      <br>
      The occasions when the Primer Fields for the Sun collapse, so that
      the Sun turns off, are evidently rare in geologic history. The
      general condition in the galaxy in which a sun can become inactive
      has not existed for over 400 million years prior to the current
      ice age epoch. <br>
      <br>
      The condition may have existed only twice before in Palaeozoic
      history, once some 450 million years ago, and once more than 700
      million years ago when the entire Earth froze up into a giant
      snowball and remained frozen for more than ten million years until
      the Sun became reactivated again. The snowball-earth theory, of
      course, is controversial. It seems too unlikely. However in the
      context of the Primer Fields dynamics, the snowball-earth event is
      totally plausible. It would have been nothing more than the
      natural occurrence of a weak electric plasma environment within a
      weak period for the galaxy as a whole.<br>
      <br>
      More significant for life on earth is the massive Ice Age 450
      million years ago when the extensive proliferation of life on our
      planet began. The only other ice epoch of equal significance,
      where the condition exist for the Sun to turn off, is the modern
      ice age epoch, the Pleistocene epoch that coincides with the dawn
      of man. <br>
      <br>
      The coincidence of the dawn of man with the Pleistocene epoch is
      significant, as it indicates that our very existence as a highly
      developed species may have been the result of the high cosmic-ray
      flux density that occurs in times when the Sun is deactivated.<br>
      <br>
      In this sense we are the children of an extremely rare occurrence,
      an ice epoch that is rich with great cosmic-ray showers. <br>
      <br>
      Since this rich condition for human development gets interrupted
      during the interglacial periods, the enriching conditions did not
      exist during the entire span of the development of what we call,
      civilization, which has occurred exclusively during the last
      interglacial period. This means that we really don't know, in
      terms of available evidence, what 'normal' living is like, even as
      we are about to become drawn into it again.<br>
      <br>
      During the lean period of the interglacial, we have seen only
      occasionally some marginal increases in cosmic-ray flux. History
      tells us that these occasions produced amazing effects. Great
      cultural breakthroughs were made in these times. The development
      of written languages, for example, occurred in one of these times.
      <br>
      <br>
      History also tells us that the great developments that did occur
      in these electrically rich time, were typically cognitive and
      scientific in nature, which makes them forms of spiritual
      development that is the pinnacle of the mental realm.<br>
      <br>
      In a very real and powerful way, the rise and fall of civilization
      follows the ebb and flow of the recognition of spiritual values in
      society. The rise and fall of spiritual recognition in turn,
      reflects the historic rise and fall of the galactic cosmic ray
      flux reaching the Earth, which is typically the inverse trend of
      solar activity. While we have no control over these trends, we
      should hold onto the developments that the trends, during rich
      periods, have provided. <br>
      <br>
      Spiritual recognition appears to be the pinnacle of our cognitive
      functions, such as, reason, love, care, generosity, creativity,
      productivity, and so forth, in which we see our humanity defined,
      and with it our civilization. <br>
      <br>
      The Spanish painter Francisco Goya illustrated the connection in
      his etching 'The Sleep of Reason Produces Monsters', of the
      Caprichos series of 1798. <br>
      <br>
      All this means that the pinnacle of our humanity, our cognitive
      and spiritual capability, is most affected by the changing
      cosmic-ray flux. For example, the cultural developments that led
      up to the founding of the USA were all wrought in the timeframe of
      high cosmic-ray flux that is coincident with the 'weak' sun of the
      Little Ice Age.<br>
      <br>
      Benjamin Franklin grew up in the high-intensity timeframe. His
      discoveries were carried forward by society. His leadership
      inspired America's declaration of Independence. This occurred even
      while the cosmic-ray flux was already diminishing again. This
      thrust came from the developments in earlier time that was carried
      forward on the wings of great leadership.<br>
      <br>
      The coincidence between cosmic-ray flux and the unfolding
      spiritual sense of humanity, is also strongly reflected in the
      history of America's most spiritual and scientific religion, named
      Christian Science. Its development began during the Dalton
      Minimum.<br>
      <br>
      The discoverer and founder of Christian Science, Mary Baker Eddy,
      was born in 1821 and grew up in a period of high cosmic-ray flux.
      Her breakthrough discovery occurred much later, in 1866, on the
      wings of her own scientific 'self-leadership.' But with the
      cosmic-ray flux being relatively low at this time, her discovered
      Christian Science didn't gain wide public acceptance until after
      1875 when the conditions improved.<br>
      <br>
      The period in which Christian Science took off and spread to many
      parts of the world, coincides with a period of relative high
      cosmic-ray flux density. However, when the high flux rate began to
      diminish, the advance faltered and began to reverse.<br>
      <br>
      Available statistics indicate that the Christian Science movement
      collapsed from 1970 onward, which coincides with the highest rate
      of solar intensity that gives us consequently the lowest
      cosmic-ray flux. The Christian Science movement collapsed from
      then on to the mere 7% that remains today.<br>
      <br>
      The same steep collapse also occurred in civilization generally,
      during this critical period of low cosmic-ray flux. The general
      collapse is reflected in high rates of spiritual insanity. <br>
      <br>
      This period, that spans slightly more than half a century,
      coincides with the most tragic revival of the system of empire the
      world may have ever seen, which forged the revival of fascism,
      terror, economic destruction, and the grand looting of society
      that is now culminating in mass genocide. <br>
      <br>
      The modern period of tragedy might be referred to some day as the
      pre-ice-age period of insanity. It is here in this period where we
      find the dawn of the Cold War nuclear terrorism that has not yet
      ended, and the devolution of science that enabled the global
      warming terrorism to emerge for genocidal purposes. <br>
      <br>
      This is the current period that was marked by the banner being
      raised that declares that the Earth has cancer and that this
      cancer is man. Under this banner the de-industrial era was
      unleashed in which evermore industries were dynamited and imports
      were brought into the West from slave-wage countries, which made
      up for the loss of production at home. On this path huge profits
      were stolen from society. <br>
      <br>
      This was the time when clever tricks for massive profiteering by
      deception began to reign, primarily in the financial markets where
      no wealth for society is actually produced. <br>
      <br>
      This period also became the period of the rise of the depopulation
      ideology that blocked economic development on all fronts and gave
      rise to AIDS, and as of late, the mass-burning of food in
      automobiles in a starving world.<br>
      <br>
      While the coincidence of the rise and fall in civilization with
      the rise of fall of cosmic-ray density does not prove a causative
      connection of the two trends with empirical certainty, the trends
      are nevertheless interesting, because their coincidence suggests
      that we may experience a dramatically enriched spiritual and
      scientific environment in the coming Ice Age when the cosmic-ray
      flax is expected to dramatically increase once the ice age
      transition unfolds, which to some degree has already begun. This
      does not mean, however, that the state of our civilization and of
      human development as a whole, is totally dependent on the
      conditions created by the changing cosmic-ray flux.<br>
      <br>
      History has shown that humanity has the power as human beings to
      raise itself above the 'floor' conditions that the cosmic-ray flux
      sets up as a kind of default state. When society doesn't exercise
      the power of its humanity, it rides the default train with all the
      consequences the changing terrain brings with it. However, when
      humanity empowers itself, which has been demonstrated on many
      occasions, it can achieve miracles that are completely
      uncharacteristic for the times. We will have to develop this
      process of self-empowerment as a pre-condition to meeting the ice
      age challenge before us. <br>
      <br>
      This challenge cannot be met with the current convention of riding
      the default train.<br>
      <br>
      Let me present an example of what self-empowerment can accomplish
      when it is built on the highest achievements of the past as a
      starting point. The issue of slavery in the USA is a perfect
      example. The issue of slavery was understood as a part of a
      greater issue, the issue of human freedom versus empire. Abraham
      Lincoln understood this, while society at large did not. Society
      was riding the default train. Slavery should have been stopped in
      the 1830s before Andrew Jackson developed it into a national
      tragedy. But it wasn't stopped. It festered and became a civil war
      that threatened the survival of the nation. And even at this
      stage, slavery wasn't stopped by an act of Congress. This type of
      breakthrough isn't made on the default train. <br>
      <br>
      Slavery was abolished by an executive order of a highly educated
      self-qualified leader. The Emancipation Proclamation was an
      Executive Order of the President to the Armed forces under his
      control. It became universally applied, subsequently. If the
      President had waited for the default train to get to this point,
      the nation would have been lost long before this would have
      happened. <br>
      <br>
      What President Lincoln has achieved was totally uncharacteristic
      for the time. This type of leadership is required again, and again
      it appears totally uncharacteristic for our time. <br>
      <br>
      The struggle for freedom versus empire must still be fully won.
      But are there any qualified leaders standing in the hustings. <br>
      <br>
      This ancient struggle must be won before we can even begin to
      consider the ice age challenge. If the needed kind of leadership
      doesn't exist yet, it needs to be developed, and fast. We can't
      afford to wait for the default train to get us to where we need to
      be, to master the ice age challenge.<br>
      <br>
      Society is presently dying on the default train. Its currency is
      being destroyed, which is no longer protected. It is being
      destroyed with excessive looting. It was once protected with the
      Glass Steagall law that a great self-developed leader had enabled
      in the USA, that had blocked the looting of the currency. The
      masters of empire spent 350 million dollars in bribery to bribe
      Congress to repeal the law. And so it was repealed. On the default
      train the robbers rule and society stands unprotected and dies by
      default for the lack of its self-leadership. There is a movement
      unfolding to restore the Glass Steagall law, but the power for
      this isn't found on the default train. Thus the law won't likely
      be restored until society pulls itself out off the default train
      and redevelops its humanity, and develops with it a higher-level
      self-leadership outside the domain that the robbers rule.<br>
      <br>
      At the present, society is so tragically rotting on the default
      train that it even tolerates to have its bank deposits stolen to
      pay of the banks' gambling losses. This happened in Cypress in
      2013, which was instigated to become the 'template' for the world.
      The process is called, 'bail in.' The laws that legalize the
      bail-in thievery to save the gamblers have already been passed in
      Europe, Canada, the USA, and in Australia and New Zealand. Unless
      you buy insurance, or such insurance exists for your bank deposits
      and is viable, your assets are fair game to be ceased. In the face
      of this exposure society lays itself down and lets it all be,
      instead of developing its power to get off the default train and
      assure its self-protection.<br>
      <br>
      The Christian Science movement is dying on the default train. The
      pioneers who would raise the platform of science within the
      framework that Mary Baker Eddy had established, were shunned or
      excommunicated. The same fate awaited, and still awaits, the
      pioneers of advanced science on many fronts, especially in the
      critical astrophysical and physical sciences where the face of
      science is controlled, dominated, and abused for political ends,
      and made subject to approval.<br>
      <br>
      The same fate is also experienced in the religions, or even more
      so there. Everything rides on the default train there. The
      outstanding leaders were few and far between, who raised the value
      of the human being and humanity far above the default concepts of
      God and man, far above doctrines, creeds, conventions and
      traditions. The high-level leadership here, would be one that
      stands on universal spiritual grounds, because the highest level
      in cognitive development is the spiritual level where we find
      love, truth, integrity, honour, generosity, humanity, and so on.<br>
      <br>
      If we develop a concept of God that includes all the concepts
      without which a high-level civilization cannot function, so that
      civilization would collapse if a single one was missing, then the
      spectrum that defines the composite of God would include Love,
      Truth, Spirit, Mind, Soul, Life, and Principle. The divine Love
      would then be reflected in love individually; Truth be reflected
      in truthfulness; Mind be reflected in wisdom and discovery; Soul
      in beauty, poetry, and song; Life in the abundance of human
      living, and Principle be reflected in powers of expression,
      production, and creation; and so on. <br>
      <br>
      This composite of the qualities that define the term God, was
      developed in the late 1800s in the USA by Mary Baker Eddy. <br>
      <br>
      What she presented after decades of self-directed, and God
      directed, scientific development was so far above the background
      of her time, that it took quite a few years for society to accept
      it and to move with it. She was a leader who stood far above the
      default train. Her development occurred against the background of
      the prayers of many, to end slavery in the land. There was a
      movement afoot away from the default train. She evidently stepped
      further towards what no one had accomplished before. Her
      breakthrough discovery may be seen as God's answer to a nation
      searching for freedom. What came out of it may also have been just
      a stepping stone towards meeting the greater challenge that now
      lays before us to adapt our world to the dark and cold environment
      of an inactive Sun.<br>
      <br>
      None of the qualities that Mary Baker Eddy laid onto the table, as
      the composite of the highest concept of God, were developed on the
      default train. High-level spiritual concepts are foreign there.
      Nevertheless they all need to become common hallmarks of
      expression that define the society of human beings, because the
      task before us, to maintain a civilization in a world under an
      inactive Sun, is extremely demanding. It is a task that requires
      the greatest qualities to be expressed on the near universal
      platform. Where in the past great leadership pointed the way, the
      future demands require that this quality is developed universally,
      or nearly so. <br>
      <br>
      When seen in the long sweep of universal history, the advent of
      Christ Jesus, and later of Christian Science, may be seen as
      critical steps for advancing the world towards the necessary
      spiritual qualities for meeting the ice age challenge before us. <br>
      <br>
      This isn't accomplished on the easy chair or on the default train.<br>
      <br>
      The easy chair needs to be banned, and fast. Our modern society is
      still riding the default train. This is dangerous. <br>
      <br>
      By the lack of its self-directed spiritual development, society
      has rendered itself unqualified to make the grade required for
      survival. Technologically, the ice age challenge can be easily
      met, but the human footsteps to accept the challenge and fulfill
      the task, are far from even being considered.<br>
      <br>
      We should become determined as never before, to get ourselves out
      of the easy chair, and off the default train, into a race to meet
      the higher and fuller expressions of our humanity in all that we
      do. And we should do this decisively as if our survival in the
      world depends on our succeeding, because, evidently, it really
      does.<br>
      <br>
      With this in mind it needs to be noted that we already see a faint
      turnaround happening towards greater expressions of the spiritual
      values in which our humanity comes more fully to light, and that
      this trend is unfolding, weak as it may be, while the money god of
      empire still rules the default scene - which is the only scene
      where empire can rule.<br>
      <br>
      The turnaround, away from the default scene, as small as this
      turnaround may presently be, leads towards scientific progress and
      an increased humanity with new spiritual paradigms that are slowly
      gaining notoriety, coupled with a sense of optimism in the air
      that the long epoch of empire is finally ending, together with the
      empire policies of looting, war, fascism, monetarism, terrorism,
      and so on.<br>
      <br>
      Our hope lies not so much in the fact that the cosmic-ray flux is
      increasing again, and that in time it will become the gold trim of
      the silver lining of the dark cloud of the coming Ice Age with its
      dimmer Sun. <br>
      <br>
      Our hope lies in the power of our self-development that builds on
      the riches that we have already won for ourselves as human beings.<br>
      <br>
      Nevertheless the coming new Ice Age isn't something to cry over,
      but is rather something that's worth celebrating. We celebrate the
      closing of what may some day be called a spiritual lean period in
      which we achieved wonders nevertheless. Let us celebrate that when
      the heliosphere vanishes that is presently created by our
      electrically powered Sun, a new age for humanity may dawn that
      will be brighter in the things that really matter than anything
      that we have seen thus far.<br>
      <br>
      When the next Ice Age begins we can expect to see a radical
      increase of the profound humanist developments to occur that have
      shaped us for the last two million years, which now, from a flying
      start, promise to be of a magnitude and quality, which we cannot
      imagine as yet, provided we survive the present world long enough
      to get there and build the infrastructures that we require to live
      in this new world that we will built for ourselves for the coming
      ice age environment.<br>
      <br>
      Getting there also means that we must end the long epoch of
      empire; that we shut down its deepening cesspools, the terror
      projects of empire, the nuclear war build-up, and the monetarism
      that empire has forged that is collapsing the world. Getting there
      further means that we scrap the depopulation ideology that is
      championed by empire, that is wrecking the economies - that we
      banish the system of empire altogether, especially its fascism
      that demands the wholesale burning of food in a starving world.<br>
      <br>
      Yes, in a physical sense, a winter is coming that promises to be
      harsh, but this winter promises to be rich in blessings that
      promise a new age of exciting potentials and many more steps
      forward in the advance of civilization on all fronts, especially
      in science, spirituality, and Christian Science. <br>
      <br>
      Yes, the ice age transition before us comes with exciting
      potentials that stand before us as a powerful incentive for us to
      awake, to open our eyes, and to let go of the nightmarish dreams
      of empire and its shackles and chokeholds<br>
      <br>
      <b>The Giza pyramids and Stone Henge</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The development of humanity appears to have always been
      intertwined with 'grasping the fire,' both mentally and
      physically. On this road humanity wrought many great wonders
      throughout the long history of its self-development. Some of the
      wonders stand as giant structures that still puzzle us today. How
      were they built? What where they built for?<br>
      <br>
      In asking these questions, some of the ancient structures that we
      marvel at, ironically, also come to light to serve as a link to
      the future. They give us a hint of what the ancient builders may
      have seen in the sky, which can no longer be seen, because the
      modern age unfolds in an electrically collapsing solar environment
      that is trending towards its impending solar cut-off point.<br>
      <br>
      The builders of the pyramids may have experienced both of the
      solar extremes: A more brilliant Sun than we have today; and the
      inactive Sun that would have created the Younger Dryas period of
      renewed glaciation, in which researchers suggest the Giza pyramids
      have been built.<br>
      <br>
      Contrary to assertions by Egyptology, the Giza pyramids were
      likely built 12,800 years ago, and not as tombs, for which they
      were later used. The distant date is derived by running the
      astrophysical clock backwards until a point is reached at which
      the Sphinx of the Giza complex is seeing its own image in the sky
      on a solstice sunrise. <br>
      <br>
      The suggested date seems to be confirmed by the complete absence
      of inscriptions inside the pyramids. Inscriptions became customary
      much later, during the time of the pharaohs. Numerous other
      features likewise place the Giza pyramids far outside the
      timeframe of the pharaohs. <br>
      <br>
      One of these features is the quality of their design, and the
      precision in construction. These place the Giza complex distinctly
      into a category of its own that nothing which the Egyptians had
      produced, and had been capable of at the time, comes even close
      to.<br>
      <br>
      Assuming that the pyramids were built 12,800 years before the
      present, which is the most reasonable estimate to date, what would
      have been the motive for the people at the time to build the giant
      structures that they built? <br>
      <br>
      It appears that the motive may have been religious in a sense,
      while it was built around astrophysical phenomena.<br>
      <br>
      During the great warming period, 2000 years previous to the
      building of the pyramids, a very large Dansgaard-Oeschger event
      broke the deep chill of the last ice age. At this time when the
      Sun became extremely active, the people may have seen with their
      naked eye the plasma images of the Primer Fields in action,
      centered on the Sun. <br>
      <br>
      The type of image that we see today in the Red Square nebula may
      have been seen 'bright' and clear in the ancient skies. The full
      image may have been seen in the time of a solar eclipse, while a
      part of the image may have been 'blazing' in the night skies from
      dusk to dawn. <br>
      <br>
      The people may have seen in the sky two pyramid shapes of light,
      with the Sun between then. On this basis the Sun may have became
      an object of worship - the giver of abundant life resting on a
      pyramid. Then, suddenly, the Sun becomes inactive again. The idea
      must have emerged at this time to build a pyramid for the Sun - a
      house for the gods, provided on the Earth <br>
      <br>
      When a thousand years later the Sun became brilliant once more and
      soon thereafter went inactive again, a deep crisis may have
      erupted that inspired the building of the greatest pyramid of all
      times to entice the Sun god to restore its shiny face for his
      people.<br>
      <br>
      The people may also have seen among the plasma images in the sky,
      perhaps right at the center of them, the famous three stars of the
      belt of the constellation Orion. <br>
      <br>
      These three stars appear to have determined the positions of the
      pyramids, their alignment to each other, and their relative size.<br>
      <br>
      When the great pyramid building project was launched, it appears
      that the ancients did not built not just one pyramid, to inspire
      the gods, but have built all three pyramids together as a single
      project, with each pyramid being exactly aligned and proportioned
      in accord with the three stars of the belt of Orion.<br>
      <br>
      In this manner the pyramids of Giza stand for us as a silent
      testimony that the brilliance of the Sun is not a permanent
      feature, but is a fleeting phenomenon at times, which once had
      inspired a monumental response by a 'nation' to get the shiny face
      of the Sun back.<br>
      <br>
      The pyramids also tell us another significant story. The evident
      fact that the Giza project was built 12,800 years ago is
      important, as it tells us that the region in which it was built
      was biologically sufficiently strong to support a large
      population.<br>
      <br>
      Giza is located near Cairo on the thirty degree latitude in the
      northern part of the Sahara.<br>
      <br>
      Petroglyphs indicate that the Sahara was a lush region before it
      became drowned in sand, perhaps by a swarm of comet fragments that
      became electrically fractured into sand while strafing the
      ionosphere, or even the atmosphere, in an event that no one lived
      to tell about. <br>
      <br>
      Since the Sahara was lush before this time and supported a
      civilization during the times of the inactive Sun, the northern
      boundary of the Sahara appears to be also the northern boundary of
      the ice age safe zone, coinciding with the thirty-five degree
      latitude.<br>
      <br>
      The safe line stretches across California in the USA, north of Los
      Angeles, and from there through the middle of the Mediterranean
      Sea, and in the East it cuts through the middle of China near
      Lianyungang, and through Japan south of Tokyo. Anything north of
      that, typically along the 40 degree line, from Beijing to Madrid
      to Philadelphia, was permafrost country during the last ice age.<br>
      <br>
      This means that large portions of the Earth become 'difficult,' if
      not impossible, to live in during the solar inactive times. This
      includes primarily Russia, China, Canada, the USA, and Europe,
      which share a common problem, and thereby are natural partners for
      building the required solution.<br>
      <br>
      If the solution requires to place agriculture onto the sea, since
      land is scarce in the tropical areas, a perfect zone exists for
      doing this right along the equator. A narrow zone exists along the
      equator that is free of hurricanes. Placing agriculture onto
      floating modules made out of basalt and produced in nuclear
      powered, automated industrial processes, is probably more easily
      accomplished than greening the Sahara in laborious manual
      operations. The same is evidently also true for the automated
      production of complete housing-modules, as a necessary and free
      infrastructure to mobilize our humanity.<br>
      <br>
      Some protest here, that this is too hard to do.<br>
      <br>
      If the people of a small culture, as far back as 12,800 years ago,
      were able to mobilize the economic resources to cut 4 million
      stone blocks out of the bedrock, weighing several tonnes each,
      transport them to the building site, and to place them with
      precision on a structure with a steep slope reaching 480 feet into
      the sky, in comparison with that, the building of bridges across
      the oceans with floating agriculture and floating pre-manufactured
      cities, is small stuff, considering the power of high-temperature
      automated industrial processes, motivated with nuclear power. A
      single 1 gigawatt plant should be able to produce 2,000 housing
      units an hour. We can have a whole new world coming online on this
      basis with comparatively little effort. No one needs to starve or
      perish when the Sun becomes inactive.<br>
      <br>
      That's what the pyramids are telling us.<br>
      <br>
      This means that the future of Canada, Russia, and Europe is
      logically located on the sea along the equator, and to a lesser
      degree the future of China and the USA. It also means that we
      better get busy soon, to transform our world. <br>
      <br>
      Another large construction project from ancient times tells us a
      similar story. The Stone Henge project, like the pyramid building
      project, reflects features that the ancient builders must have
      seen in the sky, as the features that were constructed, replicate
      critical aspects of high-power plasma physics that were only
      recently discovered in laboratory experiments.<br>
      <br>
      The Stone Henge monument features a ring of 56 chalk pits, a meter
      wide and three quarters of a meter deep, name the Aubrey holes in
      honour of the discoverer of them. Their purpose remains a puzzle
      unless one connects them with the sky.<br>
      <br>
      It was discovered in a lab experiment, published in 2003, that “A
      solid beam of charged particles tends to form hollow cylinders
      that may then filament into individual currents. When observed
      from below, the pattern consists of circles, circular rings of
      bright spots, and intense electrical discharge streamers
      connecting the inner structure to the outer structure.“ The
      maximum number of the filaments has been found to be 56.<br>
      <br>
      Another experiment shows that the concentrated plasma that flows
      between the two complementary bowl structures of the Primer
      Fields, forms a ring of 56 distinct plasma filaments, which in the
      real world, under extreme conditions, appear to have been visible
      in the sky.<br>
      <br>
      It has been noted that over long distances the filaments merge in
      groups of two or three, as can be seen in this image of the
      Supernova 1987A. <br>
      <br>
      The image shown here is giving us a cross-section view of a strong
      Birkeland current flowing in space.<br>
      <br>
      In another experiment a more perfect cross section image of a
      very-high power plasma stream has been recorded that shows the
      structure of the 56 plasma filaments self-aligned into a circle,
      and streamers flowing into two other circles, and so on.<br>
      <br>
      It is surprising to note how closely the layout of the Stone Henge
      monument, built so long ago, matches the plasma flow patterns that
      became visible only recently in experiments produced in the
      laboratory. <br>
      <br>
      The surprising similarity that we find in these two cases suggests
      that the plasma-flow patterns had been seen in the sky in ancient
      times, probably seven or eight thousand years ago in times when
      the interglacial Sun was at it peak power level. The pattern that
      was seen then, which was replicated in the monument, would have
      been the outflow pattern of the concentrated plasma that was at
      the time visibly focused onto the Sun.<br>
      <br>
      That we no longer see these types of patterns, is the natural
      consequence of the weak plasma environment today. There is simply
      not enough density left remaining for any of the plasma features
      forged by the Primer Fields to be visible. Soon, the Primer Fields
      themselves will collapse and the Sun become inactive again for
      long intervals, as it had been during the previous ice age period.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Politics versus science</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      It may well be that humanity urgently requires the ice age
      challenge that now stands before us, to awake the world from its
      current rut before the 'sleep of reason' causes humanity to become
      extinct by the nuclear war that the world's leaders of empire have
      been building weapons for, for more than 50 years already. It
      would only take an hour and a half of thermonuclear war to create
      the conditions that causes the extinction of humanity and most
      forms of life with it. <br>
      <br>
      We need to raise the value of our humanity sufficiently high to
      take the steps required to cleanse the human landscape of the
      terror of nuclear war and everything that is linked to it. This is
      a spiritual task, more than a political task. The correlation of
      cosmic-ray flux with solar activity, indicates that the advance of
      civilization is a spiritual task. This alone should inspire us to
      pursue spiritual development as the highest priority objective of
      modern time, in order to become sufficiently spiritual minded to
      protect ourselves.<br>
      <br>
      We wield weapons not out of strength. We wield weapons out of
      weakness. We wield them because of our inability to face one
      another as human beings. Let's hope that the ice age challenge
      will awake us enough to consider what human living is all about,
      before we throw it away without ever having really lived.<br>
      <br>
      We face a choice therefore. The choice is between the system of
      empire for which all wars are fought, and the platform for freedom
      on which human culture and human development depends. So far
      humanity stands impotent and tied to the ground. It stands latched
      to the system of empire where it hails the weapon and throws away
      its humanity, as if it was already dead, unable the choose life
      and to choose it more abundantly.<br>
      <br>
      In many respects humanity still lives in the Roman age, reflecting
      the grand fascist arena of monetarism married to terror,
      inhumanity, and depopulation. Large segments of humanity are
      presently being killed under the new Roman banner, and brutally
      starved, torn, and despised, while much of the world looks on
      silently, betting on the indexes for profits.<br>
      <br>
      While we no longer burn people alive by the dozen as in the grand
      arenas long ago, we simply starve them to death at a rate of
      300,000 a day by burning their food in automobiles in the form of
      biofuels.<br>
      <br>
      We need the ice age challenge as a new paradigm for living, in
      order that we may heal us of the tragedies that we have allowed to
      come upon us. <br>
      <br>
      If we fail to become human above everything else; above politics,
      economics, religion, status, and sex, and fail to see ourselves as
      a single humanity honouring one another in love, we find ourselves
      unfit to meet the ice age challenge, which, technologically is not
      a great challenge to meet.<br>
      <br>
      However, if we fail the ice age challenge, as we have failed in
      the past by not preventing the great wars, destruction, and
      looting carried out in the name of empires, then the coming ice
      age will bury us, with few exceptions. Perhaps then, in a thousand
      generations, or a million years, a new humanity will rise again
      and will not fail those challenges that we presently have no
      intention to even address. The universe won't be cheated by us
      failing ourselves. Only we lose by our failing. But why should we
      fail?<br>
      <br>
      We only need to rekindle that flame in the heart that rekindles
      our humanity and our human productive and creative power, and the
      beauty of our human soul and its scientific honesty. The world has
      become a desert landscape in all of these areas. We need to begin
      by turning the desert into an oasis across the world. The fading
      little flame of today, needs to be nourished to become a great
      fire in civilization. Surely, we can do this.<br>
      <br>
      When we get to this point, not even the sky will be a limit for
      us, much less the conditions that we find on the Earth. But will
      we do this? Will we dare to step up onto the wings and fly? Will
      we trust ourselves, for the great task? These remain still-open
      questions.<br>
      <br>
      Evidently the greatest danger before us, is not the astrophysical
      one. This one we can deal with fairly easily and protect ourselves
      from the astrophysical changes. <br>
      <br>
      The greatest danger that we face, then, is that we will do
      nothing, that we won't respond to the astrophysical challenge
      before us and die of starvation by not having created the
      infrastructures for our food supply that enables us to live richly
      in the dimmer world. <br>
      <br>
      The danger is that we keep up the present course, that we continue
      debating global warming and manmade climate change, and that we
      continue to bow to the monetarism of empire till the Sun turns off
      and goes into its sleep mode.<br>
      <br>
      We have been brainwashed to commit ourselves to the present tragic
      course by the choruses of the professional scoundrels that the
      masters of empire have bought with their money bags to keep the
      dream of empire alive. Those, who sing the empire song, are people
      who have sold their soul for a song and have turned civilization
      into a desert of starvation already, before the big challenge even
      begins. That's what the global warming hoopla; the nuclear war
      terror; and depopulation are all about, standing against the
      future of humanity, aren't they?<br>
      <br>
      A similar type a brainwashing has also been applied to keep the
      fusion-sun theory alive at all cost, as it serves the policies of
      empire well. It prevents economic development, energy development,
      and scientific development. Humanity is being kept tied into knots
      by debating the fusion-sun theory, because the outcome of the
      brainwashing promises to facilitate the cherished objectives of
      empire, which is to eliminate 6 billion people from the face of
      the planet from the present 7 billion to about 1 billion. That's
      the officially stated policy for depopulation. Would you like to
      be 'depopulated?'<br>
      <br>
      Would you like to see your children to become depopulated? This is
      what will happen if the ice age challenge is denied. If your
      answer is, yes, to the depopulation question, then sit back and do
      nothing, as you may do together with most of humanity, and you
      will have what you wish for. There is today little evidence on the
      horizon for a breakout from society's commitment to its
      small-minded thinking that has been imposed on it, such as in the
      context of the global warming scam and the fusion-sun. <br>
      <br>
      The train of the fusion-sun continues on track, even while the
      evidence is monumental that the Sun is an electrically powered
      star.<br>
      <br>
      However, behind the scene of denial of the evidence that we see -
      a denial that is political and artificial in nature - stands the
      humanity that we are - a highly intelligent species that will
      always remain what it fundamentally is, which tends to assert
      itself in times of deep crisis.<br>
      <br>
      The intelligence of humanity will make its claim, slowly as this
      may unfold, and stand for truth, and will thereby prevent the
      greatest catastrophe of all times from occurring, which would
      result with certainty if the astrophysical processes that
      evidently loom before us, would remain too long ignored and not be
      responded to.<br>
      <br>
      It is inherent in the design of humanity that the leading-edge
      thinkers will break through the fog of political games and open
      their eyes to the mountains of bodies of evidence that
      astrophysical processes have a powerful impact on earth.<br>
      <br>
      It is inherent in the intelligence that we embody and reflect as
      humanity, that the most alert scientists and truth-seekers do see
      the phase changes before they happen, by understanding the
      processes involved, and that they will inspire society to move
      with the requirements of the future that can be shaped with
      intelligent actions.<br>
      <br>
      Scientific progress remains the hallmark of humanity. Even if the
      options are at times obscured, and the paths seem tied into knots,
      enormous scientific efforts have been made, and continue to be
      made, to push forward our understanding of the universe and its
      operation, and of ourselves in the unfolding process.<br>
      <br>
      The more we move forward with our exploration on this front, the
      more will a great renaissance take shape before us, with unlimited
      energy resources that give us access to unlimited building
      materials and food supplies, all with the kind of density that
      enables us to respond to the changing solar system, which then can
      no longer endanger our civilization nor hinder its advances.<br>
      <br>
      In fact these potentials stand before us right now, to be realized
      now, and be developed fully before the Sun reverts to its inactive
      state as it did during the previous ice ages.<br>
      <br>
      In the previous ice ages the great potential that we have today to
      create a new world, did not exist, but it does exist now. As an
      intelligent species, the most advanced that ever existed on the
      Earth, we will not squander this potential. Maybe this is what the
      Universe recognized and put to our credit. Humanity had proven its
      worth before the Little Ice Age began.<br>
      <br>
      During the Little Ice Age, for the first time ever, a process was
      set in motion to create a society without empire on the distant
      shores of America. <br>
      <br>
      The pilgrims' determination for the first time in history to raise
      the finger to empire eventually resulted in the founding of the
      USA as the first sovereign nation state on the planet - the city
      on a hill that the eyes of the world were indeed fixed upon. <br>
      <br>
      The remarkable achievement that had begun, which was a radical new
      development in civilization - for a people to collectively take a
      stand against the system of empire - would likely have been lost
      together with much of humanity if the Little Ice Age had
      progressed to become the big Ice Age. But this train to near
      extinction was blocked with a major Dansgaard-Oeschger pulse that
      ended the Little Ice Age and extended the interglacial period by a
      few more hundred years from the late 1700s on. <br>
      <br>
      The extension of the interglacial was extremely critical for the
      development of civilization. It set the stage for the greatest
      economic and scientific development the world has ever seen, even
      though much was squandered away in recent years. <br>
      <br>
      The 200-year period of warm climates after the Little Ice Age,
      which was by its timing evidently a major Dansgaard-Oeschger
      pulse, gave us the population increase that is required as an
      economic base for carrying out the redevelopment of the world in
      preparation for the coming ice age period when the Sun goes on and
      off for typically 90,000 years. Was this ideal coincidence,
      accidental? Was it a gift from heaven, to save the world? Or was
      it earned by humanity?<br>
      <br>
      While the war against empire has not yet been won, the challenge
      of having to prepare the world for the environment of the dimming
      Sun will bring back to light the great achievements of the past
      and thereby swing the balance from empire and its wars and its
      money, to freedom and to the fulfillment of the common aims of all
      mankind. <br>
      <br>
      This trend away from empire towards the freedom of humanity
      started in the 1620s with the Pilgrims that settled in
      Massachusetts, who came there to set up a New World on the
      American shores, far from empire. The Peace of Westphalia that
      occurred later in 1648, to end the Thirty Years War, also started
      a movement in the same direction in Europe, which still stands to
      some degree as the foundation for modern civilization.<br>
      <br>
      On this same type of path, as the power of society's self-directed
      spiritual development is stepped up far above the default train,
      the threat of nuclear war will vanish and become forgotten history
      as though it never existed, together with all the ugly garments
      that empire still parades: its monetarism, terrorism, fascism,
      greed, slavery, genocide, poverty, hatred, lies, and so on and on.<br>
      <br>
      The requirement to meet the human need in the grandest style
      possible and with the greatest freedoms unfolding from it, has
      been the basic dream and hope in every religion that ever was,
      which is a dream that has so far never been fully realized, but
      might be realized at last as we step forward in our self-directed
      progression from religion to the scientific realization of the
      grand humanity that is inherent in us all, in which we are One.<br>
      <br>
      The astrophysical challenge of the dimming Sun puts a new type of
      challenge before us that inspires new paradigms, since the old
      paradigms no longer apply.<br>
      <br>
      This is something to celebrate. It inspires us to reclaim our
      humanity, raise it up anew, explore it in new novels, new poetry,
      and new songs, on the road of our intentional development of our
      unlimited potentials.<br>
      <br>
      This makes our future bright in spite of the dimming Sun, or
      because of it, for the challenge it imposes.<br>

      <b><br>
      </b>Perhaps you've performed that old camping trick before, where
      you created a lantern by shining a flashlight into a water-filled
      bottle. While that may have helped you find your marshmallows in
      the dark, imagine how much brighter that bottle would have been if
      it were lit directly by the Sun. Bright enough, it turns out, that
      it could brilliantly light up the interior of a one-room house.
      That's the idea behind the Isang Litrong Liwanag (A Liter of
      Light) project - it's bringing daytime indoor lighting to the
      homes of the poor in the Philippines, by installing water-filled
      plastic pop bottles through holes in their roofs.<br>
      <br>
      Isang Litrong Liwanag is run by the Philippines' MyShelter
      Foundation, which was in turn established by social entrepreneur
      Illac Diaz. The group was founded to promote social enterprise,
      appropriate technology and alternative construction in the region.<br>
      <br>
      The Solar Bottle Bulb, as it is called, was originally designed by
      students from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Its
      construction and installation is simple. A clear one-liter pop
      bottle is filled with water, chlorine is added, then the bottle is
      squeezed part way through a hole in a piece of corrugated tin. A
      corresponding hole is cut in the tin roof of a house, the
      tin-and-bottle is secured over the hole so that the bottom of the
      bottle hangs down through the ceiling/roof, then caulking is
      applied to prevent rain from getting in.<br>
      <br>
      When sunlight hits the roof and the top of the bottle, its rays
      are carried down through the water and dispersed into the interior
      of the home, giving off about as much light as a 55-watt bulb.
      Given that many of these homes lack windows, they might otherwise
      be nearly pitch black inside.<br>
      <br>
      Not only does the system produce light during daylight hours, but
      it is also providing a living for locals who build and install the
      Solar Bottle Bulbs, and it diverts bottles that might otherwise
      end up in a landfill. While the bottles don't provide light once
      the Sun sets, homeowners do at least have the option of performing
      indoor activities that require illumination during the day, when
      the light is available. They could also turn to solar-powered
      lamps such as the Solar Pebble.<br>
      <br>
      Additionally, some homes do have limited electrical lighting, but
      the Solar Bottle Bulbs allow their owners to save electricity by
      not using that lighting before dark.<br>
      <br>
      Illac Diaz has stated that he hopes to outfit one million homes
      with his system by 2012. We wish him luck in his endeavor.<br>

      <div align="center"><big><b><b>Scientists discover how to make
              ethanol using just water and CO2</b></b></big><br>
      </div>
      <b><b><br>
        </b></b>Scientists at Stanford University in the state of
      California say they’ve developed a procedure for making potent
      liquid ethanol that doesn’t rely on corn or any other crops
      traditionally involved in the process.<br>
      <br>
      The researchers disclosed their discovery in the latest online
      edition of the journal Nature, and in it they say that in less
      than three years’ time they expect to have a prototype device
      ready that will make biofuel from using not much more than carbon
      monoxide, easily derived from carbon dioxide.<br>
      <br>
      "We have discovered the first metal catalyst that can produce
      appreciable amounts of ethanol from carbon monoxide at room
      temperature and pressure – a notoriously difficult electrochemical
      reaction," wrote Stanford’s Matthew Kanan, a co-author of the
      report released this week.<br>
      <br>
      The scientists say that they are still a ways from developing said
      prototype, but believe they are on the right track towards
      achieving a goal that has the potential of providing people with a
      new, less-costly biofuel that could essentially revamp the energy
      industry.<br>
      <br>
      "I emphasize that these are just laboratory experiments today. We
      haven't built a device," Kanan said. "But it demonstrates the
      feasibility of using electricity that you could get from a
      renewable energy source to power fuel synthesis — in this case
      ethanol. There are some real advantages to doing that relative to
      using biomass to produce ethanol."<br>
      <br>
      Indeed, for one the new process unveiled out of the Ivy League
      school this week would eliminate crops from the equation needed to
      make biofuel, a change that is certain to revamp America’s
      agriculture landscape if the resources once required were no
      longer needed. According to the scientists, this alone could help
      push food prices down by no longer diverting thousands of acres
      worth of key crops to the energy sector. The traditional biofuel
      conversion process requires a single bushel of corn, for example,
      in order to make just three gallons of ethanol — along with
      hundreds upon hundreds of gallons of water, the Stanford News site
      reported this week.<br>
      <br>
      Instead, the researchers say that biofuel would be generated by
      using a state-of-the-art device still in development that uses two
      electrodes, including one made of an "oxide-derived copper," to
      convert it into fuel.<br>
      <br>
      “Copper,” the researchers wrote in their abstract, “…is the only
      known material with an appreciable [carbon monoxide
      electroreduction activity, but in bulk form its efficiency and
      selectivity for liquid fuel are far too low for practical use.”<br>
      <br>
      But using a two-stop conversion process, the Stanford scientists
      say it’s entirely feasible to create a device that would create
      potent liquid fuel without requiring acres upon acres of farmland.<br>
      <br>
      "The electrochemical conversion of CO2and H2O into liquid fuel is
      ideal for high-density renewable energy storage and could provide
      an incentive for CO2capture," they wrote.<br>
      <br>
      "Most materials are incapable of reducing carbon monoxide and
      exclusively react with water," Kanan told the Stanford News site.
      "Copper is the only exception, but conventional copper is very
      inefficient."<br>
      <br>
      "Prior to our study, there was a sense that no catalyst could
      efficiently reduce carbon monoxide to a liquid. We have a solution
      to this problem that's made of copper, which is cheap and
      abundant,” he added. “We hope our results inspire other people to
      work on our system or develop a new catalyst that converts carbon
      monoxide to fuel."<br>
      <br>
      According to the Renewable Fuels Association, the US leads the
      world in ethanol production by generation around 13.3 billion
      gallons of the biofuel during the last calendar year. <br>

        </b></b>The article says, "...make biofuel from using not much
      more than carbon monoxide, easily derived from carbon dioxide."<br>
      <br>
      Except carbon monoxide is NOT easily derived from carbon dioxide.
      In fact, carbon DIOXIDE is easily derived from carbon MONOXIDE.
      That's simple oxidation of the CO molecule, which is a gaseous
      fuel. Going the other direction, from CO2 to CO, is like trying to
      run uphill. It's a heck of a lot harder, and it takes a ton of
      energy.<br>
      BTW, Stanford is NOT an Ivy League school. That's probably the
      least consequential error in this article.<br>

          Heterogeneous Electrocatalysis for Renewable Fuel Synthesis<br>
          <br>
        </b></b>The ability to convert H2O, CO2 and N2 into fuels using
      renewable energy inputs could in principle provide a viable
      alternative to the current dominance of fossil fuels. This
      prospect faces great technical challenges, the foremost of which
      is the lack of efficient and robust electrocatalysts for the
      various multi-electron processes that fuel synthesis demands. We
      are working to address this deficiency for the two most
      challenging reactions: CO2 reduction and N2 reduction.<br>
      <br>
      We have developed a new class of catalysts called “oxide-derived”
      metal nanoparticles, which are prepared by electrochemically
      reducing a metal oxide precursor. The process of metal oxide
      reduction kinetically traps metastable nanoparticle structures
      that exhibit catalytic properties not found in nanoparticles
      prepared by conventional syntheses. Oxide-derived nanoparticles
      exhibit unprecedented efficiency for CO2 reduction at potentials
      close to the thermodynamic minimum, enabling energetically
      efficient reductions under ambient conditions. The ultimate goals
      of this research are to develop catalyst design principles that
      are applicable to multiple materials and to provide viable
      candidate electrode materials for practical devices.<br>

          Electrostatic Control of Selectivity in Catalytic Reactions<br>
          <br>
        </b></b>Current strategies for controlling selectivity in
      chemical reactions rely principally on molecular recognition
      elements. As an alternative, we are developing catalysts and
      catalyst–surface interfaces that exploit non-bonding electrostatic
      interactions to control selectivity. We are particularly
      interested in using externally-applied interfacial electric fields
      to modulate the activation barriers of competing reactive
      pathways. We have designed a reaction cell wherein the charge
      density at an electrode surface coated with an insulating layer
      can be controlled by a voltage source. By confining catalysts to
      this interface, we can externally modulate the local electrostatic
      environment in which a reaction takes place.<br>
      <br>
      We have shown that local charge density can change the selectivity
      of reactions catalyzed by both solid-state and molecular
      catalysts. Additionally, we are developing homogeneous catalysts
      with strategically placed ionic functionalities to maximize the
      influence of ion pairing and solvent effects on selectivity. The
      ultimate goals of these efforts are to link selectivity to readily
      adjustable external parameters and to address selectivity
      challenges that are particularly difficult for traditional
      approaches.<br>

      Hard-to-heal wounds, like diabetic ulcers, fester because of
      insufficient blood supply at the wound site. However, the
      application of an electrical stimulus can promote the growth of
      blood vessels, and new UC research examines the best stimulus
      parameters (such as frequency and magnitude) for successful
      therapy.<br>
      <br>
      And externally applied low-amplitude electric fields have been
      shown to help hard-to-heal chronic wounds, like those associated
      with diabetes, where there is insufficient blood supply and drug
      treatments are not effective. The externally applied electric
      field manipulates the body’s naturally occurring electricity, such
      that the new vessels are formed, and blood supply to the wound is
      increased.<br>
      <br>
      University of Cincinnati physics and biomedical engineering
      researchers recently tested for the most-effective magnitude and
      frequency when applying an external low-amplitude electric field
      to vascular cells, which are key to healing chronic wounds.
      Physics doctoral student Toloo Taghian will present the results at
      the March 3-7 American Physical Society meeting in Denver. The
      title of her presentation is “Co-Regulation of Cell Behavior by
      Electromagnetic Stimulus and Extracellular Environment.”<br>
      <br>
      The team discovered that high-frequency electrical stimulus,
      similar to that generated by cell phones and Wi-Fi networks,
      increased the growth of blood vessel networks by as much as 50
      percent, while low-frequency electrical stimulus did not produce
      such an effect. As part of their work, the UC team has developed a
      specialized antenna to apply the electrical signals to a localized
      wound, and that design is now the subject of a provisional patent.<br>
      <b><b><br>
          HOW HIGH-FREQUENCY ELECTRICITY AFFECTS VASCULAR CELL GROWTH<br>
        </b></b><br>
      The high-frequency electrical stimulus is able to change the ionic
      environment surrounding the endothelial cells, which form the
      lining of blood vessels. Inside the cells, this stimulus can
      create links with proteins (proteins have existing charges that
      react with the applied electrical field) to activate pathway
      signals leading to growth in the capillary network. The
      high-frequency electrical stimulus also causes cells to produce
      chemicals called “growth factors” that help sustain growing
      vascular networks.<br>
      <br>
      Said Taghian, “Electrical stimulation activates the pathway for
      angiogenesis (formation of new blood vessels), and the vascular
      network growth is enhanced. We can expect that, as a result, wound
      closure would be enhanced, leading to a faster healing.”<br>
      <br>
      The potential for electrical-based treatment of wounds is far
      reaching. Given the targeted, localized nature of such wound
      treatment, the application of electrical stimulus could replace or
      reduce the need for drug-based treatments which affect the entire
      body and may carry side effects. Importantly, such therapy could
      be applied using a hand-held device without the need to remove the
      wound dressing.<br>
      <br>
      The stimulus frequency used by the team was as high as&nbsp; 7.5
      billion cycles per second (Gigahertz, or GHz), and as low as&nbsp;
      60 cycles per second (Hertz, or Hz), which is the same&nbsp;
      frequency used in 120V power outlets in the United States. The
      vascular tissue cells were exposed to the electrical fields for
      one hour per day for seven days, and the rate of wound healing was
      observed for 24 hours after each treatment.<br>

      Theresa Dankovich, a chemist who did her PhD at McGill University

      <br>
      Dankovich has partnered with WATERisLIFE, an international

      need them. They've come up with an ingenious idea: the Drinkable

      <br>
      Stacks of Danvovich's paper are bound into a single volume and
      placed in a 3-D printed box that doubles as a filter container.
      The whole thing couldn't be easier. Tear a perforated sheet out of
      the book, slide it into the container, pour contaminated water,
      and presto: you've got clean drinking water in the amount of time

      </b><b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      This study demonstrates the susceptibility of a variety of
      medically important bacteria to inactivation by 405-nm light from
      an array of light-emitting diodes (LEDs), without the application
      of exogenous photosensitizer molecules. Selected bacterial
      pathogens, all commonly associated with hospital-acquired
      infections, were exposed to the 405-nm LED array, and the results
      show that both gram-positive and gram-negative species were
      successfully inactivated, with the general trend showing
      gram-positive species to be more susceptible than gram-negative
      bacteria. Detailed investigation of the bactericidal effect of the
      blue-light treatment on Staphylococcus aureus suspensions, for a
      range of different population densities, demonstrated that 405-nm
      LED array illumination can cause complete inactivation at high
      population densities: inactivation levels corresponding to a
      9-log10 reduction were achieved. The results, which show the
      inactivation of a wide range of medically important bacteria
      including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, demonstrate
      that, with further development, narrow-spectrum 405-nm
      visible-light illumination from an LED source has the potential to
      provide a novel decontamination method with a wide range of
      potential applications.<br>
      <br>
      Inactivation of microorganisms using methods involving exposure to
      light is an area of increasing research interest in part because
      of the intractable problem of microbial antibiotic resistance.
      Ultraviolet (UV) light is well established as a light inactivation
      treatment, inducing effects ranging from DNA damage, primarily as
      a result of UV absorption by DNA at wavelengths of 240 nm to 280
      nm (3), to sublethal damage of DNA repair systems caused by
      near-UV light (24). The use of UV light, however, has limitations
      due to its detrimental effects on skin tissue and components of
      the eye (28). On the other hand, visible-light inactivation, which
      traditionally requires the addition of photosensitizing molecules
      and is termed photodynamic inactivation (PDI), has been developed
      as a treatment for cancer and other medical ailments (11). The
      rapidly increasing problem of microbial antibiotic resistance has
      ignited research interest into the use of PDI as an alternative
      antimicrobial treatment. Numerous in vitro PDI studies have been
      made involving microbial inactivation, with successful results for
      bacteria, fungi, yeasts, viruses, and parasites (29, 7, 12, 2, 5).
      Furthermore, recent work has shown that photosensitization of
      bacterial cells is independent of the antibiotic resistance
      spectrum (17).<br>
      <br>
      The focus of the present study, however, concerns the
      photoinactivation of bacterial cells without the involvement of an
      applied photosensitizer. Previous studies have shown that exposure
      to visible light, more specifically, blue-light wavelengths,
      causes inactivation of certain bacterial species, including
      Propionobacterium acnes, Helicobacter pylori, and some oral
      pigmented bacteria (1, 8, 22). This inactivation mechanism, known
      to be oxygen dependent (6), is thought to be a result of the
      photoexcitation of naturally occurring endogenous porphyrins,
      which act as endogenous photosensitizers within the bacterial
      cells. This porphyrin excitation leads to energy transfer and,
      ultimately, the production of highly cytotoxic, oxygen-derived
      species, most notably, singlet oxygen (11, 26).<br>
      <br>
      Previous work has demonstrated that Staphylococcus aureus can be
      photodynamically inactivated using 400- to 420-nm visible-light,
      with maximum visible-light inactivation at 405 nm (13, 9, 10, 14),
      through an oxygen-dependent process (15). This inactivation of S.
      aureus is thought to be the result of a porphyrin-mediated process
      similar to that demonstrated with P. acnes. A previous study by
      Maclean et al. (14) utilized a broad-spectrum xenon white-light
      source combined with a range of optical filters to identify the
      sensitivity of S. aureus to wavelengths of light within the
      visible region. The present study investigates specifically the
      use of 405-nm light as the inactivating wavelength and also
      extends the scope of previous studies by producing new information
      on the sensitivities of a range of bacterial pathogens to the
      bactericidal effects of 405-nm light.<br>
      <br>
      The inactivating light used in the present study was generated
      from 405-nm light-emitting diodes (LEDs). Investigations were
      carried out on the use of the 405-nm light from the LED array
      source for the inactivation of methicillin-resistant S. aureus
      (MRSA) and a range of other important nosocomial bacterial
      pathogens—both gram-positive and gram-negative types—in the
      absence of any chemical pretreatment. The results are discussed
      with regard to the possible cellular mechanisms involved in this
      light-based inactivation and to the potential use of this method
      for environmental decontamination applications in both clinical
      and nonclinical environments....<br>

      </b><b>LED light source.</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      High-intensity 405-nm light was achieved with the LEDs in the form
      of a close-packed rectangular array of 99 individual LEDs in an 11
      by 9 matrix. The light of these 405-nm LEDs is generated in the
      active region of an InGaN/GaN semiconductor junction. These arrays
      (OD-405-99-070) are produced by OptoDiode Corp (CA). The emission
      spectrum of the 405-nm LED array is shown in Fig. ?Fig.1.1. It can
      be seen that the center wavelength for maximum emission is close
      to 405 nm, and the bandwidth is ~10 nm at full-width half-maximum.
      The LED array was bonded to a heat sink and fan to minimize the
      temperature of the semiconductor junction. The junction
      temperature was maintained at around 30°C, well below the
      specified maximum operating temperature of 100°C. This arrangement
      also ensured that the heat produced by the complete light system
      was low and had no effect on the test samples exposed to the
      405-nm light. The arrangement was mounted in a polyvinyl chloride
      housing designed to fit on top of a 12-well microplate (without
      lid), with the LED array positioned directly above a single sample
      well. The LED array was powered by a direct current supply with
      the output controllable in the range 0 to 3 A and 0 to 15 V. For
      all experiments the current was set to 0.5 ± 0.05 A at a voltage
      of 11.2 ± 0.1 V...<br>
      <br>
      <b>RESULTS</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Results for the inactivation of a selection of gram-positive and
      gram-negative bacterial samples, each with an initial population
      density 105 CFU/ml, are shown in Fig. ?Fig.22 and Fig. ?Fig.3,3,
      respectively. The control trend lines in both Fig. ?Fig.22 and
      Fig. ?Fig.33 are averages of the data from all the experiments and
      demonstrate that the unexposed populations show no significant
      change throughout the duration of the experiments. In the
      conventional manner for expression of inactivation data,
      log10(N/N0) is plotted as a function of exposure time, where N0
      and N are the bacterial populations in CFU/ml prior to and
      following inactivation, respectively. When exposed to 405-nm
      light, the different gram-positive bacteria behaved in a similar
      manner, with the exception of Enterococcus faecalis. For the
      Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, and Clostridium strains, the
      highest levels of inactivation were recorded, with an
      approximately 5-log10 reduction in CFU counts observed following
      exposure between 60 and 90 min to 405-nm light with an irradiance
      of 10 mW/cm2. Exposure of E. faecalis suspensions, however, to the
      same irradiance of 10 mW/cm2 for up to 120 min resulted in
      negligible inactivation. Nevertheless, as shown in Fig. ?Fig.3,3,
      longer exposure times did result in some inactivation of E.
      faecalis. Significant inactivation, compared to the nonexposed E.
      faecalis control sample, was demonstrated for a 240-min exposure
      period, and a 2.6-log10 reduction was recorded following exposure
      for 360 min...<br>
      <br>
      Significant inactivation of the gram-negative bacteria (Fig.
      ?(Fig.3)3) was seen following exposure to 405-nm light with an
      irradiance of 10 mW/cm2. In general, for a given reduction in
      population, the gram-negative species required longer exposure
      times than the gram-positive species. For example, a 180-min
      exposure was required to achieve a 4.2-log10 reduction with
      Acinetobacter baumannii, and 300-min exposure was required to
      achieve a 3.1-log10 reduction with Escherichia coli.<br>
      <br>
      The absolute dose in J/cm2, given by the irradiance (W/cm2) times
      the exposure time (in seconds), and the mean germicidal
      efficiency, defined as the log10 reduction of a bacterial
      population [log10(N/N0)] by inactivation per unit dose in J/cm2,
      for bacterial inactivation was calculated. Details of the
      inactivation parameters, including germicidal efficiencies, for
      all bacteria investigated following exposure to the 405-nm light
      are given in Table ?Table2.2. S. aureus NCTC 4135 displayed the
      highest level of inactivation, and the lowest germicidal
      efficiency was shown by E. faecalis...<br>

      <b>DISCUSSION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      This study has successfully demonstrated the bactericidal effect
      of visible 405-nm light on selected medically important
      gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Experiments were
      carefully conducted to ensure that the inactivation effects
      recorded were due only to the direct effects of 405-nm light and
      not to any indirect temperature effects. The results show, for the
      range of bacteria tested, that in general gram-positive bacteria
      require a much lower dose of 405-nm light for inactivation than do
      gram-negative bacteria. An exception is E. faecalis, which of the
      bacteria studied was found to be the least susceptible to
      inactivation by 405-nm light.<br>
      <br>
      The inactivation curves shown in Fig. ?Fig.2,2, ?,3,3, and ?and44
      have a shape consistent with those obtained in an earlier study
      (14), where S. aureus was inactivated using visible light of a
      wavelength greater than 400 nm. Visible-light inactivation—as
      established for other bacteria such as P. acnes, H. pylori, and
      some black-pigmented bacteria (1, 8, 22)—has been credited to the
      photostimulation of endogenous intracellular porphyrins by visible
      light in the wavelength region of 400 nm to 500 nm and, more
      specifically, 400 nm to 420 nm in the cases of P. acnes and H.
      pylori (1, 8). Stimulation of these porphyrins leads to the
      production of reactive species, predominantly singlet delta oxygen
      (1O2), which is a well-recognized trigger of cell death (11).<br>
      <br>
      A study by Nitzan et al. (17), which exposed bacteria pretreated
      with d-aminolevulinic acid (d-ALA) to 407- to 420-nm blue light,
      proposed that the different photoinactivation rates for the
      various bacteria examined (Staphylococcus, Streptococcus,
      Bacillus, Escherichia, Acinetobacter, and Aeromonas) were the
      result of the types of porphyrins produced in the different
      bacterial cells. They determined the porphyrins produced in a
      range of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria upon induction
      with d-ALA and found that the predominant porphyrin produced in
      both S. aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis was coproporphyrin,
      whereas there was no predominant porphyrin produced in the
      gram-negative E. coli, Acinetobacter, and Aeromonas strains. The
      amount of coproporphyrin produced by the staphylococcal strains
      was two to three times higher than in the gram-negative strains.
      Nitzan et al. reported that Streptococcus faecalis, reclassified
      as E. faecalis (19), did not demonstrate any inactivation for a
      dose of 100 J/cm2. This is in agreement with the present results
      (Fig. ?(Fig.22 and ?and3),3), where inactivation of E. faecalis
      was observed only for doses above this value.<br>
      <br>
      In the present study, where no photosensitizing agent was used,
      the high level of photoinactivation of staphylococcal strains is
      also likely due to the presence of high levels of coproporphyrin,
      photosensitized through blue-light illumination. Two other results
      lend support to this conclusion. One is that P. acnes, which is
      readily inactivated by visible light through photostimulation of
      endogenous porphyrins, also contains high levels of coproporphyrin
      (16), and the other is that S. aureus inactivation through
      exposure to visible light has been found to be an oxygen-dependent
      process (15). Some of the variation in germicidal efficiency
      between bacteria (Fig. ?(Fig.3)3) may follow from the use of a
      source of narrow spectral distribution. Because different bacteria
      produce different porphyrins and because the peak absorption
      wavelengths of these porphyrins may differ, different wavelengths
      may be required for their optimum photostimulation. It must also
      be noted that the bacteria used in the present study were produced
      under laboratory cultivation conditions and that the levels of
      cellular constituents such as porphyrins as well as the
      physiological status of the cells may differ considerably from
      bacteria that are found in the natural environment, such as those
      that have been shed from a mammalian host.<br>
      <br>
      The general result from the present study, that visible-light
      inactivation of gram-negative bacteria is much less efficient than
      the inactivation of gram-positive bacteria, agrees with results
      obtained by several other workers in studies involving bacteria
      pretreated with d-ALA (17, 18, 25, 23). These studies with d-ALA
      used a range of light sources including blue light, 630-nm laser
      light, and white light.<br>
      <br>
      The results of the present study, compared to the similar results
      of previous studies, add strength to the probability that the
      inactivation of the bacteria used in this study through exposure
      to 405-nm light is the result of the photostimulation of
      endogenous porphyrin molecules. However, a limitation of the
      current study is that this aspect was not specifically
      investigated, and further work is required to fully elucidate the
      exact role of porphyrins in the inactivation process resulting
      from exposure to 405-nm irradiation. In addition to this, we are
      currently developing a mathematical model for inactivation through
      exposure to 405-nm light, based on the inactivation kinetics of
      the microorganisms used in the present study.<br>
      <br>
      Visible-light inactivation of bacteria is a much less efficient
      process than is ultraviolet light inactivation. For example, Wang
      et al. (27) examined the UV inactivation of E. coli as a function
      of wavelength and calculated a maximum germicidal efficiency of
      430 log10 per J/cm2 at a wavelength of 270 nm. This compares with
      the highest value of germicidal efficiency found in the present
      work with 405-nm blue light (for a 105-CFU/ml population density
      of S. aureus) of 0.14 log10 per J/cm2. In spite of the three
      orders of magnitude difference in germicidal efficiency,
      visible-light inactivation has clear advantages in terms of its
      ease of use and substantially greater safety. In addition to
      safety benefits, prolonged exposure of materials to 405-nm visible
      light would not induce the problematic levels of photodegradation
      that are associated with similar periods of exposure to UV light,
      particularly in the UV-C region of around 254 to 260 nm typically
      used with germicidal UV lamps.<br>
      <br>
      A method that can inactivate a wide range of medically important
      microorganisms, including MRSA, using exposure to visible light
      and no requirement for pretreatment has potential for widespread
      application. Further development of this 405-nm narrow-spectrum
      illumination method could lead to potential applications as
      decontamination systems for air, contact surfaces, and medical
      instruments within the clinical environment. Due to visible
      light's much greater operational safety than UV light, an
      attractive potential method of environmental decontamination could
      involve the continuous irradiation of clinical areas, in the
      presence of patients and staff, with light of the appropriate
      photodynamic wavelengths in order to contribute to the control of
      infections in hospitals and other clinical environments. The broad
      spectrum of the bactericidal effect of the 405-nm-centered
      wavelengths against a wide range of bacteria also suggests other
      possible applications such as providing additional measures for
      controlling food-borne pathogens and food spoilage bacteria as
      well as for possible applications in water treatment and
      disinfection industries.<br>
      <br>
      Although the present study has substantially extended the range of
      bacteria that have been shown to be susceptible to 405-nm visible
      light, much more work is required to establish if this type of
      light sensitivity is a widespread phenomenon among diverse types
      of bacteria. The sensitivity of Mycobacterium spp. would, for
      example, be of considerable interest due to the medical importance
      and environmental survival and persistence characteristics of
      these organisms. It would also be of interest to determine whether
      types of bacteria that are found in environments that are normally
      exposed to natural illumination also show similar levels of
      sensitivity to irradiation around 405 nm or if these types have
      developed protective features or mechanisms to counteract the
      inactivating effects of these visible-light wavelengths.<br>

      A pioneering lighting system that can kill hospital superbugs —
      including MRSA and C. difficile — has been developed by
      researchers at the University of Strathclyde in Glasgow, Scotland.
      The technology decontaminates the air and exposed surfaces by
      bathing them in a narrow spectrum of visible-light wavelengths,
      known as HINS-light.<br>
      <br>
      Professor Anderson said: “The technology kills pathogens but is
      harmless to patients and staff, which means for the first time,
      hospitals can continuously disinfect wards and isolation rooms.<br>
      <br>
      “The system works by using a narrow spectrum of visible-light
      wavelengths to excite molecules contained within bacteria. This in
      turn produces highly reactive chemical species that are lethal to
      bacteria such as meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, or
      MRSA, and Clostridium difficile, known as C.diff.”<br>
      <br>
      Dr Maclean added: “The clinical trials have shown that the
      technology can help prevent the environmental transmission of
      pathogens and thereby increase patient safety.”<br>
      <br>
      The technology uses HINS-light which has a violet hue, but the
      research team have used a combination of LED technologies to
      produce a warm white lighting system that can be used alongside
      normal hospital lighting.<br>
      <br>
      Professor Scott MacGregor, Dean of the Faculty of Engineering,
      said: “New approaches to disinfection and sterilisation are
      urgently needed within the clinical environment, as traditional
      methods have significant limitations.<br>
      <br>
      “Decontamination methods involving gas sterilants or UV-light can
      be hazardous to staff and patients, while cleaning, disinfection
      and hand washing, although essential routine procedures, have
      limited effectiveness and problems with compliance.<br>
      <br>
      (I remember an article long, long ago about the original Priore
      discovery that seems to not be on the net in its entirety. I’m not
      sure if it’s by omission or that few even know about it.<br>
      <br>
      That article described the original Priore basement experiment
      where he was ill and in hiding. He always felt better after
      sleeping while bathed in a peach blossom violet color that was
      reflected from sunlight illuminated peaches in a basement that
      cured his illness and kept nearby oranges from rotting.<br>
      <br>
      Seems like no one else saw this or remembers it because every
      article I’ve seen about Priore speaks only of the EM radiations as
      being key to his cures.<br>
      <br>
      I suspect only years later did Priore realize this was too simple,
      that anyone could use a violet light and thats when the ‘revised’
      history came about with the electrical equipment and the peaches
      and violet light part of it was removed from the story. This
      mutated into the godawfully complex and costly Priore tube which
      at its heart had…you guessed it, a powerful violet light. Think
      not?<br>
      <br>
      “Tests made with the Prior machine on cancer tissues ALWAYS caused
      total remission in all tissues exposed to the peach blossom violet
      color which the machine emitted.”<br>
      <br>
      “The second, more powerful Prioré machine produces a magnetic
      field of about 1,240 Gauss. According to one scientist, the
      machine contains a gas-filled vacuum tube which contains a plasma
      of mercury (blue) and neon (red) gas. A pulsed 9.4 Gigahertz
      electromagnetic wave is modulated onto a 17 Megahertz wave in this
      plasma. However, the true nature of the machine is revealed by the
      fact that the 9.4 Gigahertz wave is joined in the “lamp” by 17
      radiations of unspecified frequency and nature.”<br>
      <br>
      “The (Priore) machine was working during the visit to Floirac. One
      could see the exit of the tube beneath which the biological
      targets are placed. There was a certain amount of rumbling and
      crackling, and the pinkish luminescent plasma appeared to be
      turbulent.”<br>
      <br>
      “The Master Violet Ray used different gas mixtures produce
      different glowing colours, usually purple, red, blue, or pink.”<br>
      <br>
      “In 1892 Tesla met with Paul Oudin in Paris. They discussed ways
      of building therapeutic high frequency oscillators, and months
      later Oudin produced the first device that became known as the
      “violet ray.” Paul Oudin began to experiment with skin disorders.
      Acne, eczema and psoriasis were easily treated with the new
      device. After a few treatments the skin patches would begin to
      break up and disappear completely in 2-3 months. When the devices
      were used to spark warts or skin cancer, they often were removed
      within weeks. The violet ray often took away pain, and many times
      it was practically a miracle.”<br>
      <br>
      “T. Henry Moray built a somewhat similar machine – though very
      much smaller – which provided a direct radiation from extensive
      “peach blossom violet” colored sparkgaps inside a quartz tube, and
      which greatly stimulated the health of an individual exposed to
      the radiation. In fact, the device would promptly cure the
      radiation burns Moray frequently suffered as a result of his
      continual experimentation with uranium compounds and other
      radioactive substances.”<br>
      <br>
      “…red light – regardless of intensity – fails to dislodge
      electrons in metals, while even very low levels of violet light
      stimulate measurable electrical currents. Clearly the rate at
      which light vibrates has a power all its own.”<br>
      <br>
      “The frequency of visible light is referred to as color, and
      ranges from 430 trillion Hz, seen as red, to 750 trillion Hz, seen
      as violet. Again, the full range of frequencies extends beyond the
      visible spectrum, from less than one billion Hz, as in radio
      waves, to greater than 3 billion billion Hz, as in gamma rays.”<br>

        <b>INACTIVATION OF GRAM-POSITIVE BACTERIA</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      A method for inactivating medically important Gram-positive
      bacteria including Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus
      (MRSA), Coagulase-Negative Staphylococcus (CONS), Streptococcus,
      Enterococcus and Clostridium species, comprising exposure to
      visible light, and in particular light within the wavelength range
      400-500 nm&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      [0001] The present invention relates to a method for inactivating
      medically important Gram-positive bacteria including
      Staphylococcus aureus and methicillin (multi)-resistant
      Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Coagulase-Negative Staphylococcus
      (CONS), Streptococcus, Enterococcus and Clostridium species.<br>
      <br>
      BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
      <br>
      [0002] Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is
      becoming an increasingly problematic micro-organism, with
      infection rates rising and effective methods of control becoming
      more and more limited. In addition to the resistance of MRSA to
      antibiotics, there is a significant problem due to the
      availability of few effective sterilisation methods for
      environmental decontamination; for example in air and on contact
      surfaces. Public and media interest in the transmission and
      control of MRSA is escalating and it is becoming one of the most
      significant problems within the healthcare industry. Hospitals and
      nursing homes are the worst affected areas. Furthermore,
      community-acquired MRSA is also now being recognised as an
      increasing problem, with transmission occurring in public and
      social areas such as public gyms and sports centres.<br>
      <br>
      [0003] As well as MRSA, other Gram-positive bacteria are known to
      cause health problems, particularly in the hospital environment.
      For example, Staphylococcus epidermidis, which is a
      Coagulase-Negative Staphylococcus (CONS), can cause infection,
      particularly in infants and in hospitalised patients who have
      received prosthetic implant surgery. Streptococcus pyogenes is a
      Gram-positive coccus commonly associated with infections such as
      pharyngitis, pyoderma, scarlet fever, erysipelas, cellulitis,
      streptococcal toxic-shock syndrome, rheumatic fever,
      glomerulonephritis, bacteraemia and necrotizing fasciitis, often
      referred to as "flesh-eating bacteria". Enterococcus faecalis
      (another Gram-positive coccus) is a common cause of urinary tract
      and wound infections, as well as other infections including
      bacteraemia, endocarditis and meningitis in severely ill
      hospitalised patients. Multi-antibiotic resistance is also
      becoming a well-documented problem with enterococcal infections.
      Clostridium species, in particular C. difficile, have been
      associated with high mortality in elderly patients due to
      diarrohea-associated dehydration, medically known as
      antibiotic-associated pseudomembranous colitis.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] Many techniques have been proposed for destroying harmful
      bacteria, such as MRSA. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 6,251,127
      describes a photodynamic process for the inactivation of bacteria
      and fungal wound infections using methylene blue or toluidene
      blue. Light energy in combination with photosensitising agents is
      used to treat or detect pathologies of living tissue, including
      cancer and microbiological pathogens. The light used has
      wavelengths ranging from about 450 nm to about 850 nm. Tests
      demonstrate the efficacy of the light treatment in combination
      with the photosensitising agents for the destruction of
      Staphylococcus aureus in in-vivo infected wounds; and for in-vitro
      destruction of antibiotic-resistant Staphylococcus, Streptococcus,
      Enterococcus, E. coli, Pseudomonas, Haemophilus influenza and
      Candida albicans. In addition, wavelength spectra of activation of
      methylene blue and toluidene blue in the presence of various
      concentrations of the above bacteria and Candida have been
      provided.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] Whilst in some environments, the methodology of U.S. Pat.
      No. 6,251,127 may be useful, it nevertheless suffers from the
      significant practical disadvantage that photosensitising agents
      must be applied to the bacteria that are to be inactivated. A
      similar problem arises with US2005/0049228, which also requires
      the combined use of a photosensitiser and light; in this case, in
      the range of 500 nm to 580 nm. The need for photosensitising
      agents is a significant limitation of these techniques.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] An objective of the present invention is to provide a
      simple and effective technique for inactivating selected bacteria,
      in particular MRSA, and more generally the Staphylococcus,
      Streptococcus, Enterococcus and Clostridium species.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0007] A method for inactivating one or more pathogenic
      gram-positive bacterial comprising exposure of the bacteria to
      visible light without using a photosensitiser.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] Preferably said bacteria are selected from Staphylococcus,
      in particular MRSA, CONS, Streptococcus, Enterococcus and
      Clostridium species...<br>
      <br>
      [0011] Exposing these bacteria to blue light, or white light
      containing blue light, has been found to stimulate an inactivation
      process. An advantage of using light in the visible-wavelength
      region is that there is no detrimental effect on human or animal
      health. Consequently, the method can be used for an extensive
      range of applications, such as air disinfection, contact-surface
      and materials disinfection and, most noteworthy, wound protection
      and tissue disinfection.<br>

      [0043] The use of 400-500 nm, in particular 400-450 nm,
      wavelengths of visible light (blue light) has proved to be an
      effective means of inactivation of Staphylococcus strains,
      including MRSA, as well as CONS, Streptococcus, Enterococcus and
      Clostridium, with increased inhibition rates in the 400-420 nm
      range and in particular, around 405 nm. This demonstrates that a
      light source (continuous source, flashlamp, laser etc.) with
      output at wavelengths in these regions could potentially be used
      in clinical environments for the reduction in levels of
      methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and other medically
      important Gram-positive species, present in the air and on contact
      surfaces and materials, and most importantly, could be used for
      wound protection and tissue treatment. The exact parameters
      required would depend on the bacterial strain, the wavelength of
      the light being used and the light intensity. These can be readily
      determined experimentally.<br>

      <br>
      Use of DMSO (Dimethyl sulfoxide) in medicine dates back decades.
      It was predominantly used as a topical anagesic, anti-inflammatory
      and antioxidant. Today, we know that DMSO can treat a variety of
      disorders including arthritis, mental illness, emphysema, and even
      cancer. While this is now considered a superb cancer treatment,
      orthodox medicine is not interested in discussing its benefits. If
      DMSO were to be implemented and used in cancer treatment, the
      “true cure rate” for orthodox medicine would rise from 3% to above
      90%! Here’s why.<br>
      <br>
      Supporters of DMSO have long supported the claim that it can cause
      cancerous cells to become noncancerous, or benign, and can slow or
      stop the progress of cancer in the bladder, colon, ovary, breast,
      and skin. Some evidence even suggest it is useful in treating
      leukemia, and it has also been used as a part of some metabolic
      cancer therapies.<br>
      <br>
      DMSO was first discovered in the mid- to late nineteenth century.
      In the 1950s, it was discovered that DMSO could protect cells from
      the damage of freezing. In the 1960s, Dr. Stanley Jacob, one of
      the main proponents of DMSO, began to study other medicinal
      properties of the substance. In the 1970s, DMSO was approved for
      use as an anti-inflammatory treatment in dogs and horses and as a
      prescription drug for a type of bladder inflammation in humans.<br>
      <br>
      If orthodox medicine were truly interested in curing cancer, don’t
      you think they would look for a way to target cancer cells with
      the intent of killing them while sparing normal cells?<br>
      <br>
      Chemotherapy does not target cancer cells, and because of this,
      chemotherapy:<br>
      1) Kills far more normal cells than cancer cells, and<br>
      2) Damages and toxifies many of the normal cells that do survive.<br>
      <br>
      If a “magic bullet” were used FIRST by orthodox medicine, meaning
      thecut/burn/slash/poison treatments were avoided, a 90% true cure
      rate would be easy to achieve. But the fact of the matter is that
      the leaders in the medical community have absolutely no interest
      in finding a “magic bullet.” A “magic bullet” would cost the drug
      companies hundreds of billions of dollars, patients would have
      less hospitalization, less doctor visits, etc. The fact is, no one
      wants a “magic bullet” to be found. The evidence that this is true
      is that two “magic bullets” are already known to exist, but no one
      is using them except for a handful of doctors.<br>
      <br>
      What Causes Cancer?<br>
      <br>
      Most people believe that it is DNA damage that causes cancer.
      While in rare situations, DNA can have a negative affect on a
      person’s immune system, DNA normally has absolutely nothing to do
      with the development of cancer.<br>
      <br>
      The fact is that cancer is caused by a special type of microbe
      which gets inside of normal cells and turns the cells cancerous.<br>
      <br>
      Cancer is an invading disease that attacks the body’s immune
      system. Once detected, cancer has already had enough time to
      establish its web network. Treating the tumor is not good
      enough–it is only the start.<br>
      <br>
      Actually, everyone has cancer cells forming in their body at all
      times. The immune system generally safely kills them. However,
      this means that a weakened immune system, and many other things,
      can allow cancer cells to overcome the immune system. But the
      actual formation of cancer cells is exclusively caused by microbes
      which get inside of normal cells.<br>
      <br>
      Dr. Royal Rife did an enormous amount of research into the
      relationship between microbes and cancer in the 1930s. He would
      inject mice with a virus and in 100% of the cases the mice would
      get cancer.<br>
      <br>
      Dr. Rife proposed a cure for cancer which did nothing but kill the
      viruses/microbes which were inside of the cancer cells. His cure
      was 100% successful. However, note that his cure had no intention
      of killing cancer cells or fixing DNA (which had not been
      discovered in the 1930s); its only goal was to kill microbes which
      were both inside and outside of the cancer cells. Once the
      microbes were dead the cancer cells were able to revert back into
      normal, differentiated cells.<br>
      <br>
      Dr. Rife was well aware that the critial microbes which needed to
      be killed were inside the cancer cells. The electromedicine device
      he used killed microbes inside and outside of cancer cells.<br>
      <br>
      But almost all natural substances do not normally get inside of
      cells, thus it is almost impossible for natural substances to kill
      the microbes inside the cancer cells. Natural substances can kill
      cancer cells and build the immune system, but they generally
      cannot kill microbes inside the cancer cells.<br>
      <br>
      There is no single cure for treating cancer; cancer must be
      approached and treated holistically. The cellular process in
      developing cancer takes many years–with the exception of high
      radiation or other toxic exposure, a compromised immunity and cell
      damage does not happen overnight. Treatment must be approached
      defensively and directly; focus on the cause and do not treat
      cancer in reverse. Target your treatment mentally and physically
      from the very origin.<br>
      <br>
      DMSO<br>
      <br>
      You might ask your oncologist why your chances of survival are
      only 3% (ignoring all of their statistical gibberish such as
      “5-year survival rates” and deceptive terms like “remission” and
      “response”), when your chance of survival would be over 90% if
      they used DMSO.<br>
      <br>
      It would be better for medical doctors to treat cancer patients
      with the right treatment than to have patients treat themselves at
      home. Medical doctors can diagnose better, treat better, watch for
      developing problems better, etc. Unfortunately, doctors are using
      treatments that have been chosen solely on the basis of their
      profitability rather than their effectiveness.<br>
      <br>
      DMSO is a highly non-toxic, 100% natural product that comes from
      the wood industry. But of course, like so many other potential
      cancer cures, the discovery was buried. DMSO, being a natural
      product, cannot be patented and cannot be made profitable because
      it is produced by the tonin the wood industry. The only
      side-effect of using DMSO in humans is body odor (which varies
      from patient to patient).<br>
      <br>
      The FDA took note of the effectiveness of DMSO at treating pain
      and made it illegal for medical uses in order to protect the
      profits of the aspirin companies (in those days aspirin was used
      to treat arthritis). Thus, it must be sold today as a “solvent.”
      Few people can grasp the concept that government agencies are
      organized for the sole purpose of being the “police force” of
      large, corrupt corporations.<br>
      <br>
      While it is generally believed that orthodox medicine and modern
      corrupt politicians persecute alternative medicine, this is not
      technically correct. What they do is persecute ANY cure for
      cancer, it doesn’t matter whether it is orthodox or alternative.
      The proof of this is DMSO. It appears that orthodox medicine
      persecutes alternative medicine only because there are far more
      alternative cancer treatments that can cure cancer than orthodox
      treatments.<br>
      <br>
      Another substance that targets cancer cells is being researched at
      Purdue University and other places: folic acid. This too will be
      buried unless it can lead to more profitable cancer treatments.<br>
      <br>
      But alternative medicine is rightfully not interested in combining
      DMSO with chemotherapy. DMSO will combine with many substances,
      grab them, and drag them into cancer cells. It will also blast
      through the blood-brain barrier like it wasn’t even there.<br>
      <br>
      DMSO has been combined successfully with hydrogen peroxide (e.g.
      see Donsbach), cesium chloride, MSM (though it may not bind to
      MSM), and other products.<br>
      <br>
      DMSO – Vitamin C Treatment<br>
      <br>
      Vitamin C is so simlar to glucose, that cells, and especially
      cancer cells, consume vitamin C the same way they would consume
      glucose.<br>
      <br>
      Cancer cells are anaerobic obligates, which means they depend upon
      glucose as their primary source of metabolic fuel. Cancer cells
      employ transport mechanisms called glucose transporters to
      actively pull in glucose.<br>
      <br>
      In the vast majority of animals, vitamin C is synthesized from
      glucose in only four metabolic steps. Hence, the molecular shape
      of vitamin C is remarkably similar to glucose. Cancer cells will
      actively transport vitamin C into themselves, possibly because
      they mistake it for glucose. Another plausible explanation is that
      they are using the vitamin C as an antioxidant. Regardless, the
      vitamin C accumulates in cancer cells.<br>
      <br>
      If large amounts of vitamin C are presented to cancer cells, large
      amounts will be absorbed. In these unusually large concentrations,
      the antioxidant vitamin C will start behaving as a pro-oxidant as
      it interacts with intracellular copper and iron. This chemical
      interaction produces small amounts of hydrogen peroxide.<br>
      <br>
      Because cancer cells are relatively low in an intracellular
      anti-oxidant enzyme called catalase, the high dose vitamin C
      induction of peroxide will continue to build up until it
      eventually lyses the cancer cell from the inside out! This
      effectively makes high dose IVC a non-toxic chemotherapeutic agent
      that can be given in conjunction with conventional cancer
      treatments. Based on the work of several vitamin C pioneers before
      him, Dr. Riordan was able to prove that vitamin C was selectively
      toxic to cancer cells if given intravenously. This research was
      recently reproduced and published by Dr. Mark Levine at the
      National Institutes of Health.<br>
      <br>
      As feared by many oncologists, small doses may actually help the
      cancer cells because small amounts of vitamin C may help the
      cancer cells arm themselves against the free-radical induced
      damage caused by chemotherapy and radiation. Only markedly higher
      doses of vitamin C willselectively build up as peroxide in the
      cancer cells to the point of acting in a manner similar to
      chemotherapy. These tumor-toxic dosages can only be obtained by
      intravenous administration.<br>
      <br>
      Over a span of 15 years of vitamin C research, Dr. Riordan’s
      RECNAC (cancer spelled backwards) research team generated 20
      published papers on vitamin C and cancer. RECNAC even inspired its
      second cancer research institute, known as RECNAC II, at the
      University of Puerto Rico. This group recently published an
      excellent paper in Integrative Cancer Therapies, titled
      “Orthomolecular Oncology Review: Ascorbic Acid and Cancer 25 Years
      Later.” RECNAC data has shown that vitamin C is toxic to tumor
      cells without sacrificing the performance of chemotherapy.<br>
      <br>
      Intravenous vitamin C also does more than just kill cancer cells.
      It boosts immunity. It can stimulate collagen formation to help
      the body wall off the tumor. It inhibits hyaluronidase, an enzyme
      that tumors use to metastasize and invade other organs throughout
      the body. It induces apoptosis to help program cancer cells into
      dying early. It corrects the almost universal scurvy in cancer
      patients. Cancer patients are tired, listless, bruise easily, and
      have a poor appetite. They don’t sleep well and have a low
      threshold for pain. This adds up to a very classic picture of
      scurvy that generally goes unrecognized by their conventional
      physicians.<br>
      <br>
      Because cancer cells consume 15 times more glucose than normal
      cells, under the right conditions, cancer cells should consume 15
      times more vitamin C than a normal cell. While normal cells
      benefit from vitamin C, the microbes inside of the cancer cells
      may be killed by vitamin C. It is microbes which are inside of the
      cancer cells which cause cancer and which force a cancer cell to
      remain cancerous.<br>
      <br>
      It should be mentioned that two-time Nobel Prize winner Linus
      Pauling, and an associate, Dr. Ewan Cameron, M.D., were able to
      extend the lives of cancer patients more than 10-fold using only
      10 grams of vitamin C a day by I.V.<br>
      <br>
      This protocol will modify the Pauling/Cameron protocol four
      different ways:<br>
      1) It will include DMSO in the evening dose to help Vitamin C
      target cancer cells and get inside of cancer cells,<br>
      2) It includes a very, very low glucose diet so that the cancer
      cells will feast on Vitamin C instead of glucose,<br>
      3) It includes 15% or less potassium ascorbate, which has a
      special affinity for cancer cells,<br>
      4) It will include as little sodium ascorbate (or other sodium
      forms of Vitamin C) as possible because these types of Vitamin C
      do not get inside of cancer cells very well.<br>
      <br>
      Regarding the use of potassium ascorbate, a foundation in Italy
      has proven that potassium ascorbate can be used to cure cancer
      (WARNING:no more than 15% of the Vitmain C you take should be a
      potassium version!!). See: Pantellini Foundation (Italy)<br>
      <br>
      WARNING: Do NOT use potassium ascorbate or any other form of
      potassium as your primary source of Vitamin C!!! If you use
      potassium ascorbate work with the vendor of this product to insure
      you are taking safe doses relative to non-potassium forms of
      Vitamin C!!! If your vendor does not make a recommendation, then
      use 15% as the maximum portion of Vitamin C that is a potassium
      form!!<br>
      <br>
      The second thing this treatment uses is DMSO. DMSO is used to
      “open” the ports on the cancer cells to assist getting vitamin C
      inside the cancer cells. DMSO is very well known to target cancer
      cells and open their ports. To better understand this concept see
      this article.<br>
      In summary, there are three things that help get the vitamin C
      inside the cancer cells:<br>
      1) Cancer cells consume 15 times more glucose than normal cells
      and cancer cells cannot tell the difference between glucose and
      vitamin C.<br>
      2) The use of potassium ascorbate as a part of the Vitamin C
      protocol.<br>
      3) The use of DMSO.<br>
      A fourth unique thing about this protocol is the “cancer diet.”
      The cancer diet for this treatment focuses on a LOW GLUCOSE cancer
      diet. In this way, the cancer cells have less glucose to interfere
      with their consumption of vitamin C!<br>
      <br>
      <b>Possible Swelling and Inflammation</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      There are two possible results when large amounts of vitamin C get
      inside of a cancer cell. First, the vitamin C can kill the
      microbe(s) inside the cancer cell and the cell will safely revert
      into a normal cell; or second, the vitamin C can kill the cancer
      cell itself.<br>
      <br>
      While the first of these two options will not cause any swelling
      or inflammation, the second option may cause swelling and
      inflammation.<br>
      <br>
      For this reason, anyone on this protocol who would be put at risk
      by swelling and/or inflammation (e.g. in a tumor), should
      carefully and slowly build-up to the theraputic dose of vitamin C,
      watching carefully for any potential swelling or inflammation.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Details of the Treatment</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Many people have difficulties working with DMSO. In some cases,
      when taken transdermally (through the skin) there is a skin rash
      which is simply too severe to continue the treatment. When you get
      your bottle of DMSO put one drop on your skin, spread it around a
      little bit and see if you have an allergic reaction (i.e. severe
      rash). If not, an hour later put 10 drops on your skin and spread
      it thin.<br>
      <br>
      If you do have a reaction, you may still be able to take the DMSO
      orally (added to 4 ounces of water). But if you cannot take the
      DMSO orally, and you have a skin reaction to the DMSO, you will
      have to abandon this treatment.<br>
      <br>
      If you want to know more about DMSO, see this website:<br>
      <br>
      <b>http://www.dmso.org/articles/information/muir.htm</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      <b>The Importance of the DMSO</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      This treatment uses DMSO (in the evening) and vitamin C (twice a
      day). The theory of this treatment is that the DMSO will be used
      first (in the evening dose), either taken orally (with water) or
      transdermally (through the skin). In about 10 minutes the DMSO
      will have targeted the cancer cells and will start “opening up”
      their ports.<br>
      <br>
      In the evening dose, about ten minutes after taking the DMSO, the
      vitamin C will be taken with water. When the vitamin C gets to the
      cancer cells the cells natural affinity for consuming vitamin C
      (because the cancer cells “think” the vitamin C is glucose) should
      be enhanced by the fact that the cancer cells have been “opened
      up” by DMSO.<br>
      <br>
      The theory is that the DMSO will allow a larger concentration of
      vitamin C to get inside the cancer cells than would normally
      occur.<br>
      <br>
      As already mentioned, once vitamin C can get inside of a cancer
      cell the cell may revert into a normal cell or it may be killed.
      If enough cancer cells are killed, some swelling may occur.<br>
      <br>
      <b>The Vitamin C To Be Used **VERY Important**</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      There are several different types of vitamin C. The most common
      type of vitmain C is ascorbic acid, which is not bound to a
      mineral. This type of vitamin C is largely useless until it has
      bound to minerals already in the body.<br>
      The ideal vitamin C product will have both ascorbic acid, no more
      than 15% potassium ascorbate or potassium carbonate and other
      forms of mineral ascorbates or carbonates or other forms of
      Vitamin C.<br>
      <br>
      Since sodium is generally found outside of cells and potassium is
      generally found inside of cells, to get vitamin C inside of cells
      it is best to use a potassium ascorbate. However, for safety
      reasons, most of the Vitamin C cannot be a potassium version of
      Vitamin C (talk to your vendor). If you can avoid sodium ascorbate
      and use some other non-potassium form of Vitamin C (e.g. ascorbic
      acid) use it.<br>
      <br>
      Some buffered vitamin C products have ascorbic acid and several
      different kinds of mineral ascorbates or carbonates (e.g. zinc
      carbonate). This is good, but it may be necessary to add some
      potassium ascorbate to get the percentage of potassium up to 15%
      (or whatever maximum your potassium vendor tells you). Include as
      little sodium ascorbate as possible.<br>
      <br>
      <b>The DMSO and Vitamin C Protocol</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      This treatment will be taken twice a day.<br>
      <br>
      The morning dose will only include Vitamin C. Remember to take
      VERY LITTLE glucose during this treatment!!<br>
      <br>
      The evening treatment will include two phases.<br>
      <br>
      In the evening, Phase One will be 1 TEAspoon of DMSO, taken orally
      or transdermally or some combination thereof.<br>
      <br>
      Phase Two of the evening dose should follow Phase One by 10
      minutes and will consist of 5 grams of vitamin C taken orally in
      water.<br>
      <br>
      <b>The Morning Dose – Vitamin C Only</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The morning dose, which should be taken about twelve hours before
      the evening dose, should contain 5 grams of vitamin C. Fifteen
      percent or less (or whatever your potassium vendor tells you)
      should be a form of potassium carbonate (or some other potassium
      version of Vitamin C). The other eighty-five percent should
      contain zero potassium Vitamin C and as little sodium Vitamin C as
      possible.<br>
      <br>
      <b>The Evening Dose (DMSO and Vitamin C): Phase One: Taking the
        DMSO</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The DMSO used in this protocol should be at least 99% pure DMSO
      mixed with 30% water. In other words, you should buy “70/30? DMSO,
      which means 70% pure DMSO and 30% water. Some DMSO vendors
      sellDMSO Gel or DMSO Liquid.<br>
      <br>
      The amount of DMSO taken during this treatment is so low that
      normally it can be taken orally if it is mixed with 4 ounces of
      water. However, if for any reason the DMSO cannot be taken orally
      it can be spread over the skin (such as the arms, legs or stomach)
      and taken transdermally (through the skin).<br>
      <br>
      The DMSO should be put in a glass of water before taking it
      orally. The glass of water should have at least 4 ounces of water
      in it!<br>
      <br>
      <b>The Evening Dose:</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      1a DMSO Orally) If you are taking the DMSO orally, put 4 ounces of
      a quality bottled water in a glass. Then put ONE TEAspoon of DMSO
      in the water. Drink the water (and thus the DMSO).<br>
      <br>
      Because the DMSO may cause stomach irritation, you may want to
      build up to the theraputic dose of DMSO. For example, you might
      use the following build-up:<br>
      Day 1 – Evening) Use 1/4 TEAspoon of DMSO in 4 ounces of water,<br>
      Day 2 – Evening) Use 1/2 TEAspoon of DMSO in 4 ounces of water,<br>
      Day 3 – Evening) Use 3/4 TEAspoon of DMSO in 4 ounces of water,<br>
      Day 4 – Evening) Use 1 TEAspoon of DMSO in 4 ounces of water,<br>
      Day 5 – Evening) Continue using the 1 TEAspoon of DMSO in 4 ounces
      of water.<br>
      <br>
      1b – DMSO Transdermally) If you are taking the DMSO transdermally
      (through the skin), put ONE TEAspoon of DMSO on your arms, legs or
      stomach (as close to the cancer as possible). Spread the DMSO very
      thin (i.e. over a wide area of skin). Ten minutes after spreading
      the DMSO on the skin, and AFTER the DMSO has penetrated the skin
      (and the skin is dry), you can put a skin cream on where you
      rubbed the DMSO to prevent a rash.<br>
      <br>
      <b>The Evening Dose: Phase Two: Taking the Vitamin C</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The evening dose, which should be taken about ten minutes after
      taking the DMSO, should contain 5 grams of vitamin C. Fifteen
      percent or less (or whatever your potassium vendor tells you)
      should be a form of potassium carbonate (or some other potassium
      version of Vitamin C). The other eighty-five percent should
      contain no potassium Vitamin C and as little sodium Vitamin C as
      possible. (Of course, the vitamin C may be pre-mixed).<br>
      <br>
      Here is one highly recommended potassium vitamin C vendor (Fifteen
      percent or LESS of the Vitamin C should be a potassium version
      unless your vendor of potassium ascorbate tells you differently):<br>
      Excellent Buffered Vitamin C Product<br>
      <br>
      One rounded teaspoon contains 4 grams of absorbic acid and 700 mg
      of potassium ascorbate. It also has zero mg of sodium (which is
      ideal). The ideal product will have potassium ascorbate without
      sodium ascorbate, but with other forms of Vitamin C.<br>
      <br>
      As with all vitamin C products, keep this product out of the reach
      of children! It can be very dangerous if very high doses are
      taken.<br>
      <br>
      If you have a type of cancer which could lead to a dangerous
      situation if swelling and inflammation resulted from this
      treatment, SLOWLY build up the dose of Vitamin C.<br>
      <br>
      For example, you might use the following build-up (for both
      morning and evening):<br>
      Day 1) Use 1/4 TEAspoon of vitamin C, in 6 ounces of water<br>
      Day 2) Use 1/2 TEAspoon of vitamin C, in 6 ounces of water<br>
      Day 3) Use 3/4 TEAspoon of vitamin C, in 6 ounces of water<br>
      Day 4) Use 1 level TEAspoon of vitamin C, in 6 ounces of water<br>
      Day 5) Start the full treatment at full doses<br>
      <br>
      If you experience any potentially dangerous swelling or
      inflammation during any of the days, DISCONTINUE THIS TREATMENT.<br>
      <br>
      <b>The Cancer Diet</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Any time you use a protocol which is designed to kill microbes it
      is very, very critical to avoid eating foods and drinks which feed
      or excite the microbes. This includes cancer because cancer is a
      microbial disease.<br>
      An acidic diet of foods and drinks will make this protocol less
      effective because microbes will breed much faster and be more
      aggressive in the presence of an acidic diet. In other words, the
      microbes will breed faster than you can kill them!! This includes
      the microbes which are inside the cancer cells.<br>
      <br>
      What this means is that without a solid “cancer diet” there is no
      way this cancer protocol, or any other cancer protocol, is going
      to be effective!! The “cancer diet” is also the number one way to
      stop the spreading of cancer!!<br>
      <br>
      An alkaline diet includes, among other things:<br>
      1) ZERO sugar,<br>
      2) ZERO white flour,<br>
      3) ZERO soda pops (even diet soda pops are forbidden),<br>
      4) ZERO meat,<br>
      5) ZERO dairy products (except cottage cheese during the Budwig
      Diet)<br>
      After eliminating all the foods that feed or excite microbes, what
      is left over is basically whole foods, non-sugar fruit and
      vegetable drinks and other healthy foods and drinks.<br>
      <br>
      Also, for this protocol, pay extra attention to avoiding anything
      with sugar, glucose, etc. in it (you do not have to worry about
      whole foods). <br>
      <br>
      Remember this is not only an alkaline diet but also a low-glucose
      diet.<br>
      See this article (you may need to modify this diet to avoid
      glucose not in whole foods): Cancer Diet article<br>
      <br>
      <b>Other Comments About the Protocol</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Starting 45 minutes before taking either the morning or evening
      treatment, until 45 minutes after taking the vitamin C, you should
      not eat any foods or take any other supplements. The reason is
      that the DMSO will open-up the cancer cells and the vitamin C
      should have as little competition as possible to get inside the
      cancer cells.<br>
      <br>
      In taking the evening treatment the DMSO is taken first, and the
      vitamin C is taken 10 minutes AFTER the DMSO is taken.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, the MORNING schedule may look like this:<br>
      0800 – 5 grams of vitamin C mixed in 6 ounces of water (with 15%
      or less a potassium Vitamin C)<br>
      <br>
      2000 (8 PM) – 1 TEAspoon of DMSO, mixed in 4 ounces of water<br>
      2010 (8:10 PM) – 5 grams of vitamin C in 6 or more ounces of water<br>
      <br>
      NOTICE: The evening dose, because of the DMSO, will likely create
      severe body odor. One hour after taking the DMSO the person should
      take a shower and change clothes and underware. In the morning
      they should take another shower and change their underware again.
      For some people even these precautions will not be enough. Have
      trusted people (WHO HAVE NOT TAKEN DMSO) be the judge of how bad
      you smell after the two showers and two changes of clothes and
      underware.<br>
      <br>
      <b>How Long Should the Treatment Be Taken?</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      This treatment should be taken indefinitely. Every six weeks the
      patient should take the Navarro Urine testIf the Navarro Urine
      test number does not increase each time it is taken, continue with
      this treatment.<br>
      <br>
      If the Navarro Urine test number increases, discontinue this
      treatment and use a more proven alternative cancer treatment, such
      as the Cellect-Budwig protocol or the Life One protocol of Dr.
      Howenstine.<br>
      <br>
      Then, 6 or 8 weeks AFTER the treatment is finished, please take
      another Navarro urine test. Because the Navarro urine test
      measures the amount of HCG molecules in your body, even if the
      cancer is cured, and the cancer cells are removed, the score many
      not drop as much as it should because it can take several months
      for the body to flush HCG molecules out of the body, even after
      the cancer is cured.<br>
      <br>
      What this means is that it is difficult, even using the Navarro,
      to measure the success of this treatment because there is no way
      to actually measure how many cancer cells there are in a patient’s
      body without using a PET scan or CT scan.<br>

      <b>&nbsp; </b><br>
      To solve the rising number of plastic bottles filling up landfills
      around the world, a trio of designers has created an alternative -
      a container made from an edible algae balloon.<br>
      <br>
      Called Ooho, the spheres can be produced in different sizes,
      hygienically protect the liquid inside, and cost just 2 cents
      (less than a penny) each. <br>
      <br>
      The design was recently crowned one of 12 winners of the second
      annual Lexus Design Award and is due to go on sale in Boston later
      this year.<br>
      <br>
      <b>HOW IS THE OOHO MADE?</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The Ooho sphere has a double gelatinous membrane.<br>
      <br>
      It is made using a mixture of sodium alginate, taken from brown
      algae, and calcium chloride.<br>
      <br>
      The spheres are created using gelification - a technique used in
      cooking to turn liquids into gel by adding an edible gelling
      agent.<br>
      <br>
      The inventors experimented with various spherification techniques,
      using different ingredients and proportions, before settling on
      the Ooho final ‘recipe’.<br>
      <br>
      Packaging labels can be added to the Ooho, between the two layers,
      without adhesive, and are edible too, if they’re made from rice
      paper, for example.<br>
      <br>
      'Liquid forms drops because the liquid exhibits surface tension,’
      said Ooho's creators Rodrigo Garcia Gonzalez, Pierre Paslier and
      Guillaume Couche, ‘Bounded completely or almost completely by free
      surfaces.<br>
      <br>
      ‘Ooho replicates this behaviour, encircling the water in an edible
      membrane of algae.<br>
      <br>
      ‘It is a new way of packaging that proposes an alternative to the
      plastic bottle.’<br>
      <br>
      The Ooho sphere has a double gelatinous membrane made up of sodium
      alginate, taken from brown algae, and calcium chloride.<br>
      <br>
      The spheres are created using gelification - a technique used in
      cooking to turn liquids into gel by adding an edible gelling
      agent.<br>
      <br>
      Gonzalez said the final package is ‘simple, resistant, hygienic,
      biodegradable and even edible.’<br>
      <br>
      The double membrane hygienically protects the liquid inside and
      can be expanded for different sized Oohos, pictured. The inventors
      experimented with various spherification techniques, using
      different ingredients and proportions, before settling on the Ooho
      final 'recipe'<br>
      <br>
      Around 50 billion water bottles are produced each year, and many
      end up in landfills, stock image pictured. The Ooho was designed
      as an alternative to these bottles in a bid to reduce waste and
      the impact plastic production has on the environment<br>
      <br>
      The inventors experimented with various spherification techniques,
      using different ingredients and proportions, before settling on
      the Ooho final ‘recipe’.<br>
      <br>
      This double membrane, continued the designers, hygienically
      protects the liquid inside and can be expanded for different sized
      Oohos. <br>
      <br>
      Packaging labels can be added between the two layers without
      adhesive, and are edible too if they’re made from rice paper, for
      example.<br>
      <br>
      ‘Nowadays only big companies have the infrastructure to
      manufacture packaging,’ continued Gonzalez.<br>
      <br>
      ‘The main idea of Ooho is that everyone could make them at their
      kitchen, modifying and innovating the recipe. From DIY to CIY
      (Cook It Yourself).’<br>

      <div align="center"><big><b>Newly discovered catalyst could lead
            to the low-cost production of clean methanol</b></big><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      An international research team has discovered a potentially clean,
      low-cost way to convert carbon dioxide into methanol, a key
      ingredient in the production of plastics, adhesives and solvents,
      and a promising fuel for transportation.<br>
      <br>
      Scientists from Stanford University, SLAC National Accelerator
      Laboratory and the Technical University of Denmark combined theory
      and experimentation to identify a new nickel-gallium catalyst that
      converts hydrogen and carbon dioxide into methanol with fewer
      side-products than the conventional catalyst. The results are
      published in the March 2 online edition of the journal Nature
      Chemistry.<br>
      <br>
      "Methanol is processed in huge factories at very high pressures
      using hydrogen, carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide from natural
      gas," said study lead author Felix Studt, a staff scientist at
      SLAC. "We are looking for materials than can make methanol from
      clean sources under low-pressure conditions, while generating low
      amounts of carbon monoxide."<br>
      <br>
      The ultimate goal is to develop a large-scale manufacturing
      process that is nonpolluting and carbon neutral using clean
      hydrogen, the authors said.<br>
      <br>
      "Imagine if you could synthesize methanol using hydrogen from
      renewable sources, such as water split by sunlight, and carbon
      dioxide captured from power plants and other industrial
      smokestacks," said co-author Jens Nørskov, a professor of chemical
      engineering at Stanford. "Eventually we would also like to make
      higher alcohols, such as ethanol and propanol, which, unlike
      methanol, can be directly added to gasoline today."<br>
      <br>
      <b>Industrial methanol</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Worldwide, about 65 million metric tons of methanol are produced
      each year for use in the manufacture of paints, polymers, glues
      and other products. In a typical methanol plant, natural gas and
      water are converted to synthesis gas ("syngas"), which consists of
      carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and hydrogen. The syngas is then
      converted into methanol in a high-pressure process using a
      catalyst made of copper, zinc and aluminum.<br>
      <br>
      "We spent a lot of time studying methanol synthesis and the
      industrial process," Studt said. "It took us about three years to
      figure out how the process works and to identify the active sites
      on the copper-zinc-aluminum catalyst that synthesize methanol."<br>
      <br>
      Once he and his colleagues understood methanol synthesis at the
      molecular level, they began the hunt for a new catalyst capable of
      synthesizing methanol at low pressures using only hydrogen and
      carbon dioxide. Instead of testing a variety of compounds in the
      lab, Studt searched for promising catalysts in a massive
      computerized database that he and co-author Frank Abild-Pedersen
      developed at SLAC.<br>
      <br>
      "The technique is known as computational materials design,"
      explained Nørskov, the director of the SUNCAT Center for Interface
      Science and Catalysis at Stanford and SLAC. "You get ideas for new
      functional materials based entirely on computer calculations.
      There is no trial-and-error in the lab first. You use your insight
      and enormous computer power to identify new and interesting
      materials, which can then be tested experimentally."<br>
      <br>
      Studt compared the copper-zinc-aluminum catalyst with thousands of
      other materials in the database. The most promising candidate
      turned out to be a little-known compound called nickel-gallium.<br>
      <br>
      "Once we got the name of the compound out of the computer, someone
      still had to test it," Nørskov said. "We don't do lab experiments
      here, so we have to have a good experimental partner."<br>
      <br>
      Nørskov turned to a research group at the Technical University of
      Denmark led by co-author Ib Chorkendorff. First, the Danish team
      carried out the task of synthesizing nickel and gallium into a
      solid catalyst. Then the scientists conducted a series of
      experiments to see if the new catalyst could actually produce
      methanol at ordinary room pressure.<br>
      <br>
      The lab tests confirmed that the computer had made the right
      choice. At high temperatures, nickel-gallium produced more
      methanol than the conventional copper-zinc-aluminum catalyst, and
      considerably less of the carbon monoxide byproduct.<br>
      <br>
      "You want to make methanol, not carbon monoxide," Chorkendorff
      said. "You also want a catalyst that's stable and doesn't
      decompose. The lab tests showed that nickel-gallium is, in fact, a
      very stable solid."<br>
      <br>
      While these results show promise, a great deal of work lies ahead.
      "We'd like to make the catalyst a little more clean," Chorkendorff
      added. "If it contains just a few nanoparticles of pure nickel,
      the output drops quite a bit, because pure nickel is lousy at
      synthesizing methanol. In fact, it makes all sorts of chemical
      byproducts that you don't want."<br>
      <br>
      Nickel is relatively abundant, and gallium, although more
      expensive, is widely used in the electronics industry. This
      suggests that the new catalyst could eventually be scaled up for
      industrial use, according to the authors. But to make methanol
      synthesis a truly carbon-neutral process will require overcoming

      The use of methanol as a fuel and chemical feedstock could become
      very important in the development of a more sustainable society if
      methanol could be efficiently obtained from the direct reduction
      of CO2 using solar-generated hydrogen. If hydrogen production is
      to be decentralized, small-scale CO2 reduction devices are
      required that operate at low pressures. Here, we report the
      discovery of a Ni-Ga catalyst that reduces CO2 to methanol at
      ambient pressure. The catalyst was identified through a
      descriptor-based analysis of the process and the use of
      computational methods to identify Ni-Ga intermetallic compounds as
      stable candidates with good activity. We synthesized and tested a
      series of catalysts and found that Ni5Ga3 is particularly active
      and selective. Comparison with conventional Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalysts
      revealed the same or better methanol synthesis activity, as well
      as considerably lower production of CO. We suggest that this is a
      first step towards the development of small-scale low-pressure
      devices for CO2 reduction to methanol.<br>

      A catalytic composition is provided for methanol production. The
      composition includes an alloy of at least two different metals M
      and M', where M is selected from Ni, Pd, Ir, and Ru, and M' is
      selected from Ga, Zn, and Al. A molar ratio of M to M' is in the
      range of 1:10 to 10:1, and the alloy is configured to catalyze a
      reduction of CO2 to methanol.<br>

              cellulose into energy storage devices</b></big></big><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Based on a fundamental chemical discovery by scientists at Oregon
      State University, it appears that trees may soon play a major role
      in making high-tech energy storage devices.<br>
      <br>
      OSU chemists have found that cellulose – the most abundant organic
      polymer on Earth and a key component of trees – can be heated in a
      furnace in the presence of ammonia, and turned into the building
      blocks for supercapacitors.<br>
      <br>
      These supercapacitors are extraordinary, high-power energy devices
      with a wide range of industrial applications, in everything from
      electronics to automobiles and aviation. But widespread use of
      them has been held back primarily by cost and the difficulty of
      producing high-quality carbon electrodes.<br>
      <br>
      The new approach just discovered at Oregon State can produce
      nitrogen-doped, nanoporous carbon membranes – the electrodes of a
      supercapacitor – at low cost, quickly, in an environmentally
      benign process. The only byproduct is methane, which could be used
      immediately as a fuel or for other purposes.<br>
      <br>
      "The ease, speed and potential of this process is really
      exciting," said Xiulei (David) Ji, an assistant professor of
      chemistry in the OSU College of Science, and lead author on a
      study announcing the discovery in Nano Letters, a journal of the
      American Chemical Society. The research was funded by OSU.<br>
      <br>
      "For the first time we've proven that you can react cellulose with
      ammonia and create these N-doped nanoporous carbon membranes," Ji
      said. "It's surprising that such a basic reaction was not reported
      before. Not only are there industrial applications, but this opens
      a whole new scientific area, studying reducing gas agents for
      carbon activation.<br>
      <br>
      "We're going to take cheap wood and turn it into a valuable
      high-tech product," he said.<br>
      <br>
      These carbon membranes at the nano-scale are extraordinarily thin
      – a single gram of them can have a surface area of nearly 2,000
      square meters. That's part of what makes them useful in
      supercapacitors. And the new process used to do this is a
      single-step reaction that's fast and inexpensive. It starts with
      something about as simple as a cellulose filter paper –
      conceptually similar to the disposable paper filter in a coffee
      maker.<br>
      <br>
      The exposure to high heat and ammonia converts the cellulose to a
      nanoporous carbon material needed for supercapacitors, and should
      enable them to be produced, in mass, more cheaply than before.<br>
      <br>
      A supercapacitor is a type of energy storage device, but it can be
      recharged much faster than a battery and has a great deal more
      power. They are mostly used in any type of device where rapid
      power storage and short, but powerful energy release is needed.<br>
      <br>
      Supercapacitors can be used in computers and consumer electronics,
      such as the flash in a digital camera. They have applications in
      heavy industry, and are able to power anything from a crane to a
      forklift. A supercapacitor can capture energy that might otherwise
      be wasted, such as in braking operations. And their energy storage
      abilities may help "smooth out" the power flow from alternative
      energy systems, such as wind energy.<br>
      <br>
      They can power a defibrillator, open the emergency slides on an
      aircraft and greatly improve the efficiency of hybrid electric
      automobiles.<br>
      <br>
      Besides supercapacitors, nanoporous carbon materials also have
      applications in adsorbing gas pollutants, environmental filters,
      water treatment and other uses.<br>
      <br>
      "There are many applications of supercapacitors around the world,
      but right now the field is constrained by cost," Ji said. "If we
      use this very fast, simple process to make these devices much less
      expensive, there could be huge benefits."<br>

      <b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Here, we present a simple one-step fabrication methodology for
      nitrogen-doped (N-doped) nanoporous carbon membranes via annealing
      cellulose filter paper under NH3. We found that nitrogen doping
      (up to 10.3 at %) occurs during cellulose pyrolysis under NH3 at
      as low as 550 °C. At 700 °C or above, N-doped carbon further
      reacts with NH3, resulting in a large surface area (up to 1973.3
      m2/g). We discovered that the doped nitrogen, in fact, plays an
      important role in the reaction, leading to carbon gasification.
      CH4 was experimentally detected by mass spectrometry as a product
      in the reaction between N-doped carbon and NH3. When compared to
      conventional activated carbon (1533.6 m2/g), the N-doped
      nanoporous carbon (1326.5 m2/g) exhibits more than double the unit
      area capacitance (90 vs 41 mF/m2).<br>
