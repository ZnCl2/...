          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wreck for the fleet near the Adriatic Sea:<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The land trembles stirred up upon the air
          placed on land:<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Egypt trembles Mahometan augment,<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Herald surrenders himself, to cry is
          commissioned. (C.2:86)<br>
          <br>
          Nostradamus has predicted a great naval battle in the Adriatic
          Sea. Line two indicates an earthquake. Egypt is threatened by
          Muslims, as also is prophesied in line 3 of C.5:27 ("to
          tremble Pharos") and in the following quatrain. Line 4
          suggests that a new prophet will arise, or that a diplomat or
          religious leader will taken hostage.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Arab prince Mars, Sun, Venus, Lion<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The reign of the Church will succumb to the
          sea<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Toward Persia well near a million<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Byzantium, Egypt will resist the
          temptation. (C.5:25)<br>
          <br>
          Mars, Sol and Venus conjoin in Leo in <b>August 2015</b>,
          and&nbsp; in <b>August 2019</b>.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One whom the gods of infernal Hannibal<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will bear to be reborn, terror of humans<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Never more of horror nor worse days<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the past than will come by Babel to
          Romans. (C.2:30)<br>
          <br>
          The ancient Carthaginian conqueror Hannibal will reincarnate
          and attack Rome again. Carthage in North Africa was founded by
          the Phoenicians. This suggests that Libya (Carthage) will
          attack Italy first. Babel (line 4) is now Iraq; apparently
          Libya and Iraq will join forces under the aegis of ISIS, the
          CIA-Mossad-MI6 proxy army.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How many times will you be taken, Solar
          City.<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Changing the Barbarian and vain laws,<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your end approaches: you will be more
          tributary,<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The great Adria will recover through your
          veins. (C.1:8)<br>
          <br>
          The "Solar City" probably is Rome, since it is mentioned in
          relation to "the great Adria" (Adriatic Sea).<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the Orient will come the Punic heart<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To vex Adria and the heirs of Romulus,<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Accompanied by the Libyan fleet<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Malta to tremble and nearby islands empty.
          (C.1:9)<br>
          <br>
          "The Punic heart" refers to the Carthaginian Hannibal of
          C.2:30, attacking Italy ("the heirs of Romulus") with the
          Libyan fleet in the Adriatic Sea. Italy will be invaded by sea
          (C. 2: 43). The islands of the Mediterranean Sea will be
          pillaged:<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Naples, Palermo, and all Sicily<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The entire coast will remain desolated:<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There will remain no suburb, city or town<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not pillaged and robbed by the Barbarians.
          (C.7:6)<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The chief of Persia will occupy great
          Olchades<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The trireme fleet against the Mahometan
          people<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From Parthia, and Media: and the Cyclades
          pillaged:<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Long rest at the Ionian port. (C.3:64)<br>
          <br>
          The Muslims will invade southwest Spain (Olchades). The
          Cyclades are islands in the Aegean Sea. Parthia and Media were
          located in what is now Iran. "The Ionian port" is either
          Venice or Trieste.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From Monaco to near Sicily<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The entire coast will remain desolated:<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There will remain no suburb, city or town<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not pillaged and robbed by the Barbarians.
          (C.2:4)<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The legion in the marine fleet<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will burn lime, lodestone, sulfur and
          pitch:<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The long rest in the secure place:<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Port Selyn and Monaco, fire will consume
          them. (C.4:23)<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Greater calamity of blood and famine,<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seven times it approaches the marine shore:<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Monaco from hunger, place captured,
          captivity,<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The great one led crunched in an iron cage.
          (C.3:10)<br>
          <br>
          These quatrains are reasonably clear, spelling doom for the
          inhabitants of the Mediterranean coast of Europe. A ruler or
          military commander will be captured and put in a cage or
          armored vehicle. ISIS is fond of cages, as shown in their
          propaganda videos.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the country of Arabia Felix<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There will be born one powerful in the law
          of Mahomet<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To vex Spain, to conquer Granada,<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And more by sea against the Ligurian
          people. (C.5:55)<br>
          <br>
          Arabia Felix is the area between Yemen and Aden. Liguria is
          now Genoa, Italy.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The year that Saturn and Mars are equally
          fiery<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The air hot, dry, long trajectory<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From secret fire, the great heat burns the
          place to ashes<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Little rain, hot, arid, wars, incursions.
          (C.4:67)<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The strange nation will divide spoils,<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Saturn in Mars his aspect furious:<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Horrible slaughter of Tuscans and Latins,<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Greeks, who will desire to strike. (C.1:83)<br>
          <br>
          This quatrain repeats the schedule of C.4:67 above. "The
          strange nation" ( the new Muslim Caliphate ) will pillage and
          slaughter the Italians and Greeks, who will continue to resist
          the invaders. The French too will be attacked by the
          Muslims.&nbsp; "Saturn in Mars" is meaningless per se, unless
          a conjunction is meant. Both planets will be in Leo in the <b>summer





            of 2019 and 2023</b>. Nostradamus repeatedly warned the
          French navy not to overextend itself in the Mediterranean Sea,
          but the advice will be ignored:<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If France you pass beyond the Ligurian Sea,<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You will see yourself in the isles and seas
          enclosed:<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mahomet contrary, more so the Adriatic Sea:<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of horses and asses you will gnaw the
          bones. (C.3:23)<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gallic fleet, do not approach Corsica,<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Less Sardinia, you will repent of it:<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Every single one will die frustrated of the
          end of the cape:<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You will swim in blood: captive you will
          not believe me. (C.3:87)<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The great Satyr and Tiger of Hyrcania<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gift presented to those of the Ocean:<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A chief of the fleet will come from
          Carmania<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who will take land at Tyrren Phocaean.
          (C.3:90)<br>
          <br>
          In this quatrain, a naval commander who hails from Hyrcania
          (now part of Iran) will attack Marseilles ("Tyrren Phocaean").
          These quatrains may have been fulfilled in 1655, when the
          French fleet was sunk in the Gulf of Lyon, or in 1940 when the
          British navy destroyed the French fleet off the coast of
          Algiers.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because of Gallic discord and negligence<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A passage will be open to Mahomet<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Blood soaks the land and sea of Senois<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Phoenician port covered with sails and
          ships. (C.1:18)<br>
          <br>
          "The Phoenician port" is Marseilles, where the Muslims will
          enter France, which will be weakened by subversive immigrants
          and civil disorder, and will be unable to repel the invaders.
          The Senois (line 3) are the Senons, an ancient Gallic tribe.
          Venice will be captured.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; France because of Negligence assailed on
          five sides,<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tunis, Algiers stirred up by Persians:<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Leon, Seville, Barcelona having failed,<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the Venetians there will be no fleet.
          (C.1:73)<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The inhabitants of Marseilles completely
          changed,<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Flight and pursuit up to near Lyon,<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Narbonne, Toulouse wronged by Bordeaux<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Killed and captive nearly a million.
          (C.1:72)<br>
          <br>
          According to the apparent interpretation of these clear
          visions, the Muslims will penetrate deep into France. Nearly a
          million persons will be killed or captured as they flee or
          fight. See also C.1:92.<b><br>

      Comment: Be aware that it's become clear that ISIS is supported,
      supplied and funded by AIPAC - who is ran by the US/Israel as well
      as the other powers that seeks to create the chaos that we are now
      seeing. This manufactured threat has real life consequences, such
      as what will come from tens of thousands of migrants seeking to
      get into Italy and other European countries.<br>
      <br>
      ISIS has threatened to flood Europe with half a million migrants
      from Libya in a 'psychological' attack against the West, it was
      claimed today.<br>
      <br>
      Transcripts of telephone intercepts published in Italy claim to
      provide evidence that ISIS is threatening to send 500,000 migrants
      simultaneously out to sea in hundreds of boats in a 'psychological
      weapon' against Europe if there is military intervention against
      them in Libya.<br>
      <br>
      Many would be at risk of drowning with rescue services unable to
      cope. But authorities fear that if numbers on this scale arrived,
      European cities could witness riots.<br>
      <br>
      Separately, the militants hope to cement their control of Libya
      then cross the Mediterranean disguised as refugees, according to
      letters seen by Quilliam the anti-terror group, reported by the
      Telegraph.<br>
      <br>
      Italian Minister for the Interior Angelino Alfano said on Monday
      that Libya was the 'absolute priority' and insisted there was 'not
      a minute to lose' for the international community.<br>
      <br>
      He said: 'If the militias of the Caliphate advance faster than the
      decisions of the international community how can we put out the
      fire in Libya and stem the migration flows? We are at risk of an
      exodus without precedent.'<br>
      <br>
      More than 170,000 migrants arrived in Italy by boat last year.
      Since last Friday almost 4,000 have been rescued.<br>
      <br>
      The spread of militancy across Libya was predicted by the
      country's deceased leader Muammar Gaddafi, who warned the
      Mediterranean would become 'a sea of chaos'.<br>
      <br>
      ISIS had not yet made frightening inroads into Libya when he made
      this chilling prophecy during his last interview in March 2011.<br>
      <br>
      But the Arab Spring uprising that year sparked a civil war in
      Libya and opposition forces - backed by NATO - deposed Gaddafi in
      violent coup just five months after his ominous prediction.<br>
      <br>
      In October 2011, forces loyal to the country's transitional
      government found the ousted leader hiding in a culvert in Sirte
      and killed him.<br>
      <br>
      Four years later, Islamic State kidnapped 21 Egyptian Coptic
      Christians in Sirte - Gaddafi's birthplace - before releasing
      gruesome footage of their beheading on the shores of the
      Mediterranean, just 220 miles south of Italy. In it the terrorists
      warned that they 'will conquer Rome'.<br>
      <br>
      In response, Italian security chiefs have approved plans to put
      4,800 soldiers on the country's streets to help prevent terrorist
      attacks.<br>
      <br>
      The statement from the Interior Ministry said they would guard
      'sensitive sites' until at least June and reports claim 500 will
      be deployed in Rome - where soldiers are already guarding
      diplomatic residences, synagogues and Jewish schools.<br>
      <br>
      The troops are also expected to be deployed at tourist venues such
      as archaeological sites and monuments.<br>
      <br>
      A treaty between Gaddafi and the Italian premier provided for
      joint boat patrols which curtailed the departure of migrant boats
      from Libya.<br>
      <br>
      But, as the Libyan despot predicted back in 2011, if the Gaddafis
      were brought down, Islamists would exploit the power vacuum.<br>
      <br>
      Still holding court in a Bedoin tent while holed up in the
      fortified citadel of Bab Al Azizya, Gaddafi warned: 'If, instead
      of a stable government that guarantees security, these militias
      linked to Bin Laden take control, the Africans will move en mass
      towards Europe.'<br>
      <br>
      He added: 'The Mediterranean will become a sea of chaos.'<br>
      <br>
      That very sea ran red with blood when Islamic State brutally
      executed 21 Egyptian Christians on its shores.<br>
      <br>
      The accompanying video, released on Sunday, showed the men dressed
      in orange jumpsuits and shackled - kneeling in the sand before the
      militants slit their throats and watched them bleed to death.<br>
      <br>
      Egypt retaliated furiously by launching coordinated airstrikes on
      ISIS targets in Libya.<br>
      <br>
      The European powers were putting their own security at risk by
      helping the rebels, Gaddafi pointed out.<br>
      <br>
      He told Il Giornale, the Italian newspaper owned by his former
      friend Silvio Berlusconi he was saddened by the attitude of his
      friend. They no longer spoke.<br>
      <br>
      'I am shocked at the attitude of my European friends. They have
      endangered and damaged a series of great security treaties in
      their own interest.'<br>
      <br>
      Without his harsh, but effective, regime, the entire North African
      Mahgreb 'would become another Gaza,' he claimed.<br>
      <br>
      Overrun: The majority of Libya's coastal cities have surrendered
      control to Islamic State and other rebel extremist groups created
      to oppose the NATO-led invasion which removed Gaddafi from power<br>
      <br>
      The telephone transcripts, seen by Il Messaggero newspaper claimed
      to provide evidence 'that IS will use the migrants as a
      "psychological weapon" against countries that say they want to
      intervene in Libya, in particular, against Italy.'<br>
      <br>
      'As soon as our country mentioned armed intervention on Libya the
      jihadists suggested they let drift, bound for Italy, hundreds of
      boats full of migrants. The figure discussed is five hundred
      thousand, most of the 700,000 that are on the coast waiting to
      board,' the newspaper reported.<br>
      <br>
      Following the dire threat Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi
      immediately backtracked from his government's previous rhetoric
      saying that 'it was not the time for military intervention'.<br>
      <br>
      Foreign Minister Paolo Gentiloni said this morning that Italy does
      not want to embark on 'adventures, never mind Crusades' in Libya.<br>
      <br>
      But former President Giorgio Napolitano said that the 'biggest
      error' in the post-Gaddafi's period was the European Unions 'lack
      of involvement' in the country.<br>
      <br>
      Meanwhile following direct threats on Rome, the commander of
      Vatican City's 110-man Swiss Guard said his forces are ready to
      defend Pope Francis if ISIS attempt a strike .<br>
      <br>
      Colonel Christoph Graf said 'Following the terrorists' threats,
      we're asking the guards to be more attentive and observe peoples'
      movements closely. If something happens we're ready, as are the
      men of the Gendarmerie.'<br>

      <br>
      Hola Folks!<br>
      <br>
      You might want to check into this;<br>
      <br>
      NEO Keshe based plasma reactor generator;<br>
      <br>
      <b>https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/KeelyNet_Interact/conversations/messages/2220</b><br>
      <br>
      NEO main page;<br>
      <br>
      <b>http://neo.sx/index-neo3.html</b><br>
      <br>
      The NEO device is based on the Keshe plasma reaction patents you
      can download at;<br>
      <br>
      <b>http://neo.sx/patentes-neo.html</b><br>
      <br>
      Claimed to last 35 years, power comes from 'the atmosphere' with
      no batteries or panels of any kind.<br>
      <br>
      Claims to use the Keshe plasma reactor to capture 'radiant'
      energy, the reason theirs works is the use an element that
      deteriorates over time. no moving parts. Even when turned off, it
      will produce energy. The units can be parallel connected for more
      power.<br>
      <br>
      What makes them special is they claim to have a unique element
      used in the reactor which decays over time but can be refurbished.<br>
      <br>
      (This is kind of like LENR cold fusion claims where the materials
      become corroded over time due to internal transmuatuions, thus
      requiring replacement. Currently Rossi is claiming over 1MW of
      heat tested over a one month period, yet they still aren't testing
      them in the real world of homes or businesses. Piantelli has prior
      patents and his group is working on 1kw, 5kw, 10kw, 20kw, 100kw
      and higher models...much more logical)<br>
      <br>
      3500 watts for 1.980 euros - $2,244.23 US Dollar<br>
      6500 watts for 2.860 euros - $3,241.67 US Dollar<br>
      <br>
      CONDITIONS OF PURCHASE:<br>
      - The delivery of the order is 5-7 business days.<br>
      - The unit price includes shipping to the customer.<br>
      - The price include customs tax and administrative expenses in the
      country of the customer.<br>
      - All units are guaranteed for 5 years against failure of
      faricacion. In case of drive failure in warranty period is NEO who
      is responsible for removing the unit and replace it with a new one
      without any cost to the customer. Check warranty conditions here<br>
      <br>
      For the purchase of 5 or more units will automatically apply the
      discount wholesale 20%.<br>

      Panamá - +507 8339964<br>

      USA - +1 7864058854<br>
      <br>
      They accept visa, mastercard, american or bank withdrawal through
      paypal and claim 100% guaranty.<br>
      <br>
      Now both Paypal and these credit card companies allow you to
      reverse charges for a fraudulent claim. We saw something similar
      with the Canadian claim of a water generator where they too
      accepted credit cards, but they seem to have fallen off the map.<br>
      <br>
      So it would seem you are protected UNLESS there is some trick
      description in the claims for what you are actually buying that
      can be disputed for them to keep the money.<br>
      <br>
      I've not been a Keshe fan from day one, but these guys seem to
      have put a lot of time into this and claim working products
      available within 2 weeks of purchase.<br>
      <br>
      Maybe we could do a crowdfunding project to buy one and test it???
      Or someone with extra bucks buy and test it and let us know.<br>
      <br>
      At any rate, it is a most interesting claim with more details than
      normal for such devices. Thanks to Michael J for sharing this.<br>

      <br>
      I've not found anyone who has bought one of the NEO devices or
      gone through the buying process...I did find this on youtube;<br>
      <br>
https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/KeelyNet_Interact/conversations/messages/2221<br>
      <br>
      I did a search on youtube and found this video where the guy is
      really pissed even though he hasn't bought one but is guessing as
      to what is inside, saying it is a ripoff and more;<br>
      <br>
      https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu7omTs10ak<br>
      <br>
      but it doesn't look like he has actually purchased one that I can
      tell. He postulates how they could trick people and explains his
      version of how they would do it.<br>
      <br>
      I see no changes on the NEO homepage;<br>
      http://neo.sx/index-neo3.html<br>
      <br>
      You'd think their website would post testimonials to encourage
      sales. Something fishy here.<br>
      <br>
      Might be like that idiot Alek using ultracaps to hold charges and
      claiming free energy and electric bikes that run forever,
      etc...he's on some weird ego trip so I give him no oxygen.
      Checkered past with claims and all...<br>
      <br>
      NEO claims to use a special material (unspecified) for the plasma
      electrode saying once you start the thing, it will generate power
      continually even if you remove all loads and as a result of it
      burning all the time, it will burn out in about 5 years at which
      point you can refurbish it.<br>
      <br>
      Sounds like every LENR project I've ever read...exotic
      batteries...the transmutation that occurs from the heat generation
      process pollutes the elements and 'electrolyte' over time so the
      heat slowly dies.<br>
      <br>
      However, you can refurbish it just we do with lead acid batteries.
      Rossi makes these outrageous power claims of 1MW and more...lab
      queens so far, not tested powering a house or business...but
      Piantelli and his group claim the generators will be in the 100
      watt to seven kilowatt range...much is way more rational and
      comparing Piantellis granted patent to Rossis application and it
      looks like a university professor compared to a plumber.<br>
      <br>
      How many free energy claimants have you heard over the years
      spouting super high power output using 18-26 gauge
      wire...&lt;lol&gt;...like that idiot Don Smith who might be dead
      by now.<br>
      <br>
      And yet NONE of them can meet Hal Puthoffs' One Watt Challenge;<br>
      <br>
http://www.zpenergy.com/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=1144<br>
      <br>
      Just ONE WATT...surely they can scrape that out of their 100kw
      free energy machine! But no, not to my knowledge.<br>
      <br>
      Here is the Rossi and Piantelli info;<br>
      <br>

      COP 11!<br>
      http://www.keelynet.com/news/110914b.html<br>
      ---<br>
      My point being that NEO appears like LENR becuase you can
      REFURBISH the consumed electrode in the NEO unit...which makes
      sense, burning matter <br>
      in another form than wood or gas...seems like there would be some
      radiation associated with its operation.<br>
      <br>
      But no one has a unit to test that I can find...it LOOKS like the
      buyer is protected by using a credit card...if it doesn't work as
      you were told, return it and file a charge reversal.<br>
      <br>
      The water generator guy from Canada had a similar scheme but he
      has gone off the map. George Wiseman sent a guy out to the guys
      location and it was an empty building...<br>

      But I think their contract might be tricked up so they can dispute
      it and win to keep the money if you try to reverse the charges as
      a defrauded or item misrepresented customer...<br>

      NEO Energy Units<br>
      Energy NEO Units are small in size and appearance is practically
      the same as a UPS, or common and similar in size UPS.<br>
      <br>
      Our innovative system allows the sum of all units that have
      connected. Each unit provides an output power of 400W, if required
      4000W, simply interconnect 10 units each other.<br>
      <br>
      HOW LONG DOES A GENERATOR?<br>
      All generators are NEO designer to provide energy continuously
      guaranteed for 35 years.<br>
      <br>
      WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE 35 YEARS pass?<br>
      Once this period of time has elapsed, the generator starts to
      produce energy with very low power, then the generator must
      recycle new one.<br>
      <br>
      WHAT FUEL USED?<br>
      NEO Energy Generators are designed and manufactured to not need
      fossil fuels of any kind.<br>
      <br>
      WHERE DID TAKE THE POWER?<br>
      All generators extract energy from the atmosphere as does a solar
      panel sun, but in the case of our generators, must not have
      batteries or panels of any kind. You can view our website the
      documentation section where you will find some of the patents that
      NEO was inspired to make the generators.<br>
      <br>
      HOW DOES INTERNALLY?<br>
      Our optimized system collects the abundant radiant energy from the
      atmosphere and is excited the system using a plasma reactor also
      NEO manufacturing. The ensemble performs the operation to capture
      the radiant and is magnified by the reactor. The part or key
      element of our system is the reactor and is the element that after
      life deteriorates and disables the system.<br>
      <br>
      IS THERE TO DO ANY INVESTMENT BUY AFTER THE GENERATOR?<br>
      When you buy a generator NEO should not perform any additional
      investment if you want to install an electrician at home the cost
      is extremely low, because the installation is very simple.<br>
      <br>
      HOW MUCH DOES NOISE?<br>
      All NEO generators are soundproofed and the noise is very similar
      to that can produce a new refrigerator.<br>
      <br>
      GASES does it make?<br>
      By not consuming any fossil fuel no combustion occurs and
      therefore there is no smoke and exhaust gases, so that you can
      have the generator inside a home, that if, with ventilation to
      capture the radiant energy atmosphere.<br>
      <br>
      DOES THE GENERATOR VIBRA?<br>
      No, no moving parts inside no vibration occur.<br>
      <br>
      WHAT HAS WARRANTY?<br>
      All NEO generators have 2 years warranty against manufacturing
      defects Total. In case of problems with a unit under warranty our
      after-sales service it is replaced free of charge and sent him to
      the country where you made the purchase.<br>
      <br>
      CAN PUT in the open?<br>
      Our generators can be installed on the outside and work without
      problems in extreme weather conditions, withstanding rain or snow.<br>
      <br>
      CAN CONNECT MORE OF A GENERATOR IN PARALLEL?<br>
      Yes, the XT102 Moledos can be interconnected to add the power of
      all generators who wants to have connected simultaneously.<br>
      <br>
      HOW IS IN OPERATION?<br>
      The entire range of Generators NEO have a button on and off. The
      drive is manual, so if the user wishes not produce energy must
      turn it off manually, it will continue producing energy while not
      being exploited.<br>

      reactor with a similar name;<br>

      Our nuclear tower is the size of a residential jacuzzi, ie about
      1.5 meters wide. Capable of generating 25 MWe, ie, enough to
      supply a population of 20,000 households electricity. This
      portable reactor is based on a new nuclear fission technology
      patented by Otis Peterson, scientist Los Alamos National
      Laboratory (ANLL) in 2003 and was later made ??available to
      Hyperion Power Generation for manufacturing. It can be transported
      by truck, plane or boat.<br>
      <br>
      The reactor is interred at a considerable depth and does not emit
      any gas harmful to the atmosphere and above all, no residual
      radiation emitted. A nuclear reactor that does not generate
      radiation ? That would be like saying a rain that wets or a tax
      not bugs. It really seems a challenge but the company explains
      claiming that they use a fuel that is unlike anything used in
      nuclear weapons. This reactor consumes only a reactive uranium
      enriched to 10% while that of military use is around 98%. They
      also sell the completely sealed and ready to be buried caldera.
      And if accidentally opened, the fuel will cool quickly without
      harming anything that is outside. And the stack is able to
      generate power without stopping for five years. Sounds good right?<br>
      <br>
      The downside (as I said) is that the finished cell fission, leaves
      a cake of radioactive material the size of an orange that to see
      who is the handsome guard in his garden.<br>
      <br>
      And where's the scoop? Well, they already have 3 factories
      producing reactors by 2013 are expected to be 4,000 HPG but for
      now have received a firm order for 100 units to a few industries
      in remote areas. The device costs $ 25 million (20 million euros)
      and considering that provides power to 20,000 homes a very
      favorable monetary amount (about 1000 euros per household) is
      obtained.<br>
      <br>
      That's all I've been able to find so far...<br>
      <br>
      Good luck!<br>

            ultra-fast propulsion</b></big><br>
        <br>
        <img alt="" src="octopusrobotprop.jpg"><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Scientists have developed an octopus-like robot, which can zoom
      through water with ultra-fast propulsion and acceleration never
      before seen in man-made underwater vehicles.<br>
      <br>
      Most fast aquatic animals are sleek and slender to help them move
      easily through the water but cephalopods, such as the octopus, are
      capable of high-speed escapes by filling their bodies with water
      and then quickly expelling it to dart away.<br>
      <br>
      Inspired by this, scientists from the University of Southampton,
      Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and the Singapore-MIT
      Alliance for Research and Technology built a deformable
      octopus-like robot with a 3D printed skeleton with no moving parts
      and no energy storage device other than a thin elastic outer hull.<br>
      <br>
      The 30cm long self-propelling robot is inflated with water and
      then rapidly deflates by shooting the water out through its base
      to power its outstanding propulsion and acceleration, despite
      starting from a non-streamlined shape. As the rocket contracts, it
      can achieve more than 2.6 times the thrust of a rigid rocket doing
      the same manoeuvre.<br>
      <br>
      It works like blowing up a balloon and then releasing it to fly
      around the room. However, the 3D printed polycarbonate skeleton
      inside keeps the balloon tight and the final shape streamlined,
      while fins on the back keep it going straight.<br>
      <br>
      The robot is capable of accelerating up to ten body lengths in
      less than a second. In recent laboratory tests, the robot
      accelerated a one kilogram payload up to 6mph in less than a
      second. This is comparable to a mini-cooper carrying an additional
      350kg of weight (bringing the total weight of the car to 1,000kg)
      accelerating from a standstill to 60mph in one second –
      underwater.<br>
      <br>
      This performance is unprecedented in man-made underwater vehicles.<br>
      <br>
      Dr Gabriel Weymouth, Lecturer for the Southampton Marine and
      Maritime Institute at the University of Southampton and lead
      author of the study, says:<br>
      <br>
      “Man-made underwater vehicle are designed to be as streamlined as
      possible, but with the exception of torpedoes, which use massive
      amounts of propellent, none of these vehicles achieve speeds of
      even a single body length per second or accelerations of 0.1g,
      despite significant mechanical complexity.<br>
      <br>
      “Rigid bodies always lose energy to the surrounding water, but the
      rapidly shrinking form of the robot actually uses the water to
      help propel its ultra-fast escape, resulting in 53 per cent energy
      efficiency, which is better than the upper estimates for
      fast-starting fish.”<br>
      <br>
      The researchers calculate that making the robot bigger would
      improve its fast-starting performance, which could have
      applications in the development of artificial underwater vehicles
      that can match the speed, manoeuvrability and efficiency of their
      biological inspirations. The understanding this study provides
      could also have an impact in other engineering fields where drag
      is critical, such as airplane wing design, and to the study of
      different shape-changing biological systems.<br>
      <br>
      The study, which is published in Bioinspiration and Biomimetics,
      was funded with support from the Singapore-MIT Alliance for
      Research and Technology and from the MIT Sea Grant program.<br>

      </b><b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      We design and test an octopus-inspired flexible hull robot that
      demonstrates outstanding fast-starting performance. The robot is
      hyper-inflated with water, and then rapidly deflates to expel the
      fluid so as to power the escape maneuver. Using this robot we
      verify for the first time in laboratory testing that rapid
      size-change can substantially reduce separation in bluff bodies
      traveling several body lengths, and recover fluid energy which can
      be employed to improve the propulsive performance. The robot is
      found to experience speeds over ten body lengths per second,
      exceeding that of a similarly propelled optimally streamlined
      rigid rocket. The peak net thrust force on the robot is more than
      2.6 times that on an optimal rigid body performing the same
      maneuver, experimentally demonstrating large energy recovery and
      enabling acceleration greater than 14 body lengths per second
      squared. Finally, over 53% of the available energy is converted
      into payload kinetic energy, a performance that exceeds the
      estimated energy conversion efficiency of fast-starting fish. The
      Reynolds number based on final speed and robot length is *** . We
      use the experimental data to establish a fundamental deflation
      scaling parameter $\sigma *$ which characterizes the mechanisms of
      flow control via shape change. Based on this scaling parameter, we
      find that the fast-starting performance improves with increasing
      size.<br>

      A method and apparatus for providing reduced drag on a body moving
      in a direction D through a selected fluid medium at a speed U
      which is normally sufficient to cause turbulence. Reduced drag is
      generally accomplished by flexing at least the outer surface of at
      least the rear third of the body to produce a wave-like motion of
      the body having a wavelength of between 0.5 and 2.0 times the
      length of the body, a reduced frequency value OMEGA between 0.1
      and 0.5 and a time delay between successive points on the body
      reaching peaks for their flex motion which is directly
      proportional to the distance xi in the direction D of the point
      from a reference point on the body and inversely proportional to
      the phase speed cp of the wave. A variety of techniques are
      described for achieving the desired wave-like motion.<br>

      <div align="center"><big><b>How to move a boat without an engine,
            paddles or sails</b></big><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Researchers say technology they have developed would let boats or
      small aquatic robots glide through the water without the need for
      an engine, sails or paddles.<br>
      <br>
      A University of Pittsburgh research team has designed a propulsion
      system that uses the natural surface tension that is present on
      the water's surface and an electric pulse to move the boat or
      robot, researchers said. The Pitt system has no moving parts and
      the low-energy electrode that emits the pulse could be powered by
      batteries, radio waves, or solar power, researchers said in a
      statement.<br>
      <br>
      The system bio-mimics the propelling skill of some insects that
      float on the water and move by leaning one way or the other. For
      example, researchers said they were inspired by the way beetle
      larvae move on water.&nbsp; Like any floating object, larva
      resting in the water causes the surface tension to pull equally on
      both sides. To move forward, the larva bends its back downward to
      change the tension direction behind it. The forward tension then
      pulls the larva through the water, said Sung Kwon Cho, senior
      researcher and a professor of mechanical engineering and materials
      science in Pitt's Swanson School of Engineering.<br>
      <br>
      One of the system's primary applications could be as a&nbsp;
      cheap, environment-friendly robot that could traverse the world's
      oceans, gathering research data, Cho said.<br>
      <br>
      Pitt researchers said that in their experiments, an electrode
      attached to a 2-centimeter-long "mini-boat" emitted a surge that
      changed the rear surface tension direction and propelled the boat
      at roughly 4 millimeters per second. A second electrode attached
      to the boat's front side served as the rudder.<br>
      <br>
      The Pitt system is similar to the MIT developed robot known as a
      Robostrider.<br>

      WATCHING Sung Kwon Cho's model boat glide silently across the
      still water with no propellers or sails, you'd be forgiven for
      thinking a phantom hand was drawing the vessel forward. The boat
      is actually being driven by water surface tension, the same force
      that allows some insects to skate across the surface of a pond.<br>
      <br>
      The design is inspired by Pyrrhalta beetle larvae, which also use
      surface tension to propel themselves. Since it requires no moving
      parts, the method should be more robust than those involving
      propellers and may use just a hundredth of the power. This could
      be ideal for extending the working life of cheap,
      environment-sensing robots that roam the world's oceans, says Cho,
      who is at the University of Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania. Normally,
      the surface tension of the water surrounding a floating object is
      equal on every side. To upset this balance and create a forward
      thrust, Cho's team attached an electrode to the back of the boat
      that alters the curve of the water's meniscus.<br>
      <br>
      The electrode is coated in an insulating polymer and Teflon, which
      is normally hydrophobic. Applying a potential to the electrode
      changes the insulating layer's charge distribution and makes the
      electrode more attractive to water - a process called
      electrowetting. This extra attraction changes the shape of the
      water's meniscus so that it curves upwards rather than downwards
      at the back of the boat, changing the balance of forces and
      pushing the boat forward (see diagram).<br>
      <br>
      In tests to be presented later this month at the MEMS 2009
      conference in Sorrento, Italy, the team propelled a
      2-centimetre-long prototype at roughly 4 millimetres per second.
      "By streamlining the boat and optimising the electrodes, we could
      achieve speeds of 10 centimetres per second," says Cho (a video of
      the boat in action is at www.snipurl.com/9ut8wMovie Camera).<br>
      <br>
      Ramin Golestanian from the University of Sheffield in the UK is
      impressed with the work. "It's a very clever trick that puts
      fundamental physics into practice," he says. He thinks it should
      be simple to manufacture robots with a series of these electrodes
      along their side to provide very precise motion control.<br>

            universal mechanism of aging</b><br>
        </big><br>
        <b>by David Cameron</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      BOSTON, Mass. (Nov. 26, 2008)--Like our current financial crisis,
      the aging process might also be a product excessive deregulation.<br>
      <br>
      Researchers have discovered that DNA damage decreases a cell's
      ability to regulate which genes are turned on and off in
      particular settings. This mechanism, which applies both to fungus
      and to us, might represent a universal culprit for aging.<br>
      <br>
      "This is the first potentially fundamental, root cause of aging
      that we've found," says Harvard Medical School professor of
      pathology David Sinclair. "There may very well be others, but our
      finding that aging in a simple yeast cell is directly relevant to
      aging in mammals comes as a surprise."<br>
      <br>
      These findings appear in the November 28 issue of the journal
      Cell.<br>
      <br>
      For some time, scientists have know that a group of genes called
      sirtuins are involved in the aging process. These genes, when
      stimulated by either the red-wine chemical resveratrol <br>
      <br>
      Nearly a decade ago, Sinclair and colleagues in the Massachusetts
      Institute of Technology lab of Leonard Guarente found that a
      particular sirtuin in yeast affected the aging process in two
      specific ways -- it helped regulate gene activity in cells and
      repair breaks in DNA. As DNA damage accumulated over time,
      however, the sirtuin became too distracted to properly regulate
      gene activity, and as a result, characteristics of aging set in.<br>
      <br>
      "For ten years, this entire phenomenon in yeast was considered to
      be relevant only to yeast," says Sinclair. "But we decided to test
      of this same process occurs in mammals."<br>
      <br>
      Philipp Oberdoerffer, a postdoctoral scientist in Sinclair's
      Harvard Medical School lab, used a sophisticated microarray
      platform to probe the mammalian version of the yeast sirtuin gene
      in mouse cells. The results in mice corroborated what Sinclair,
      Guarente, and colleagues had found in yeast ten years earlier.<br>
      <br>
      Oberdoerffer found that a primary function of sirtuin in the
      mammalian system was to oversee patterns of gene expression (which
      genes are switch on and which are switch off). While all genes are
      present in all cells, only a select few need to be active at any
      given time. If the wrong genes are switched on, this can harm the
      cell. (In a kidney cell, for example, all liver genes are present,
      but switched off. If these genes were to become active, that could
      damage the kidney.) As a protective measure, sirtuins guard genes
      that should be off and ensure that they remain silent. To do this,
      they help preserve the molecular packaging -- called chromatin --
      that shrink-wraps these genes tight and keeps them idle.<br>
      <br>
      The problem for the cell, however, is that the sirtuin has another
      important job. When DNA is damaged by UV light or free radicals,
      sirtuins act as volunteer emergency responders. They leave their
      genomic guardian posts and aid the DNA repair mechanism at the
      site of damage.<br>
      <br>
      During this unguarded interval, the chromatin wrapping may start
      to unravel, and the genes that are meant to stay silent may in
      fact come to life.<br>
      <br>
      For the most part, sirtuins are able to return to their post and
      wrap the genes back in their packaging, before they cause
      permanent damage. As mice age, however, rates of DNA damage
      (typically caused by degrading mitochondria) increase. The authors
      found that this damage pulls sirtuins away from their posts more
      frequently. As a result, deregulation of gene expression becomes
      chronic. Chromatin unwraps in places where it shouldn't, as
      sirtuin guardians work overtime putting out fires around the
      genome, and the unwrapped genes never return to their silent
      state.<br>
      <br>
      In fact, many of these haplessly activated genes are directly
      linked with aging phenotypes. The researchers found that a number
      of such unregulated mouse genes were persistently active in older
      mice.<br>
      <br>
      "We then began wondering what would happen if we put more of the
      sirtuin back into the mice," says Oberdoerffer. "Our hypothesis
      was that with more sirtuins, DNA repair would be more efficient,
      and the mouse would maintain a youthful pattern gene expression
      into old age."<br>
      <br>
      That's precisely what happened. Using a mouse genetically altered
      to model lymphoma, Oberdoerffer administered extra copies of the
      sirtuin gene, or fed them the sirtuin activator resveratrol, which
      in turn extended their mean lifespan by 24 to 46 percent.<br>
      <br>
      "It is remarkable that an aging mechanism found in yeast a decade
      ago, in which sirtuins redistribute with damage or aging, is also
      applicable to mammals," says Leonard Guarente, Novartis Professor
      of Biology at MIT, who is not an author on the paper. "This should
      lead to new approaches to protect cells against the ravages of
      aging by finding drugs that can stabilize this redistribution of
      sirtuins over time."<br>
      <br>
      Both Sinclair and Oberdoerffer agree with Guarente's sentiment
      that these findings may have therapeutic relevance.<br>
      <br>
      "According to this specific mechanism, while DNA damage
      exacerbates aging, the actual cause is not the DNA damage itself
      but the lack of gene regulation that results," says Oberdoerffer.
      "Lots of research has shown that this particular process of
      regulating gene activity, otherwise known as epigenetics, can be
      reversed--unlike actual mutations in DNA. We see here, through a
      proof-of-principal demonstration, that elements of aging can be
      reversed."<br>
      <br>
      Recent findings by Chu-Xia Deng of the National Institute of
      Diabetes, Digestive and Kidney Diseases, has also found that mice
      that lack sirtuin are susceptible to DNA damage and cancer,
      reinforcing Sinclair's and Oberdoerffer's data.<br>

      SANTIAGO Sat Nov 15, 2008 <br>
      (Reuters) - Copper socks? Copper towels? How about copper subway
      poles? These are only a few of the ways Chile, the world's biggest
      copper producer, is utilizing the red metal which is more commonly
      found in the construction and auto sectors.<br>
      <br>
      Used since ancient times to make tools, weapons and plumbing
      systems, Chilean innovators are experimenting with ways to exploit
      copper's bacteria- and fungus-fighting characteristics.<br>
      <br>
      "Public transport systems, where germs can be transmitted and
      there are large numbers of people, are a potential market for
      applications for surface-metal copper," said Jurgen Leibbrandt,
      head of market development for the Chilean state copper giant
      Codelco.<br>
      <br>
      "In clothes there is another venue ... where it has excellent
      anti-fungus qualities," he said.<br>
      <br>
      Scientists say the power of copper to fight germs lies in the fact
      that copper ions separate on contact with bacteria and cause
      irreversible damage to the bacteria's cells.<br>
      <br>
      Codelco is already working with the private sector to market
      socks, towels, pillow cases and underwear sewn with copper
      fibresthat fight fungi and even help combat acne.<br>
      <br>
      And the private sector is in a drive to join Chile's leading
      export, copper, with another major exporter, the salmon industry,
      to cut disease in fish stocks.<br>
      <br>
      Chile is the world's second largest salmon producer after Norway,
      but the industry has high costs because of expensive solutions to
      controlling infections.<br>
      <br>
      "Joining these two industries to finding a solution that is
      economically viable is certainly viable," said Leibbrandt.<br>
      <br>
      One Chilean entrepreneur, Joaquin Ruiz, has invented copper sponge
      filters to purify water on salmon farms, eliminating disease and
      fungi and reducing the large amounts of costly antibiotics
      currently employed to do the same job.<br>
      <br>
      "That means huge savings. Instead of using large quantities of
      antibiotics and germ killing agents, with this you are just
      putting up a simple sanitary barrier," Ruiz, the developer of the
      Metal Foam sponges, told Reuters.<br>
      <br>
      Codelco is experimenting with bacteria-repellent cages for the
      industry.<br>
      <br>
      Investigators are also looking into where they can use the metal
      to reduce levels of infection in hospitals. They have found the
      metal helps to kill Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus
      (MRSA), a bacterium responsible for difficult-to-treat infections
      in humans.<br>
      <br>
      "If you prevent one MRSA infection, you save $21,000, so your
      return on investment will be very very short, perhaps one
      patient," said Michael Schmidt, of the University of South
      Carolina medical school.<br>
      <br>
      "So this is going to be a fairly efficient and inexpensive
      solution to combat infections."<br>
      <br>
      Some hospitals in the United States are testing copper as a
      germ-resistant surface material in place of stainless steel. A
      British study several years ago showed that drug-resistant staph
      germs survived for three days on stainless steel surfaces but were
      not detectable on copper surfaces after 90 minutes.<br>

      The pill contains glycine, an amino-acid that causes the body to
      generate more heat than it can otherwise produce. It is hoped the
      pill might enable men to stay alive longer in icy water, and
      hasten the warming of a man who has been chilled to a critical
      point of exposure. At the laboratory, operated by the Air Force at
      Ladd Air Force Base, volunteers are taking the pills with no
      evidence of ill effect. If the tests are successful the pills
      could be included in survival kits.<br>

      </div>
      <b> </b><br>
      A cleaning agent that not only kills potentially harmful bacteria,
      germs, mold and mildew, but removes odours and stains as well. The
      secret lies in the machine that puts ozone into the H20 from your
      kitchen tap.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;"We're taking the oxygen in that water and just converting
      it to super oxygen," explains inventor Steve Hengsperger. "So
      we're taking the O2 and converting it to O3." <br>
      <br>
      He calls ozone a "natural sanitizer" that's 50 percent stronger
      than bleach and works 3,000 times faster. And he maintains that
      not even mutated germs can survive its power. <br>
      <br>
      Water that's treated with the substance is harmless to kids, pets
      and plants and doesn't hurt the environment, unlike some cleaners
      laced with ammonia or other chemicals. It breaks down completely
      after about 15 minutes and is always potable. Researchers say you
      can spray it on a diaper pail or a laundry hamper as a
      disinfectant. <br>
      <br>
      You can use it to kill invisible nasties lurking on stove and
      kitchen countertops. And scientists swear you can even spray it on
      food to kill any microorganisms lurking there. <br>
      <br>
      The invention comes with a variety of different models, including
      one for your kitchen and food and even one for your toothbrush.
      Treating the water requires buying the unit and that involves a
      not so minor monetary outlay, although the manufacturers believe
      you'll make it back by not having to purchase any other clearing
      products at your store. <br>
      <br>
      It costs around Cdn.$200 to get it into your home, but once you've
      got one, it's supposed to last for years. <br>

            greenhouse emissions<br>
          </big></b></div>
      <br>
      It is made of wax, is barely three inches across and comes in any
      colour you like, as long as it's black. And it could save more
      greenhouse gas emissions than taxes on gas guzzling cars, low
      energy light bulbs and wind turbines on houses combined. It is the
      e-cube, and it is coming soon to a fridge near you. <br>
      <br>
      Invented by British engineers, the £25 ($49USD) gadget
      significantly reduces the amount of energy used by fridges and
      freezers, which are estimated to consume about a fifth of all
      domestic electricity in the UK. <br>
      <br>
      The patented cube mimics food and is designed to fit around a
      fridge's temperature sensor, which usually measures the
      temperature of the circulating air. Because air heats up much more
      quickly than yoghurt, milk or whatever else is stored inside, this
      makes the fridge work harder than necessary. <br>
      <br>
      With the cube fitted, the fridge responds only to the temperature
      of the food, which means it clicks on and off less often as the
      door is open and closed. Trials are under way with supermarkets,
      breweries and hotels. <br>
      <br>
      One of the largest, the Riverbank Park Plaza hotel in London,
      fitted the device to each of the hotel's 140 major fridges and
      freezers. David Bell, chief engineer, says energy use decreased by
      about 30% on average - enough to slash the hotel's annual
      electricity bill by £17,000<br>

        How Refrigeration Works</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Refrigeration units work in a series of cycles. This is when the
      unit starts and stops to maintain the required storage
      temperature. Air cycles (on/off) typically produce a minimum of 12
      cycles per hour and, in some open display cases, 20 cycles per
      hour.<br>
      <br>
      Refrigeration units usually monitor circulating air temperature in
      order to decide when to switch on and off. However, circulating
      air temperature tends to rise quickly, far more quickly than food
      temperature and, as a result, refrigeration works harder than
      necessary to maintain stored products at the right temperature.
      This in turn leads to excessive electricity consumption and undue
      wear and tear on the equipment.<br>
      How the eCube Works<br>
      <br>
      The eCube consists of a food stimulant contained in a
      double-skinned enclosure. The food simulant mimics food
      temperature at around 10mm below the surface. It is like having
      your thermostat regulating the temperature by the temperature of
      the yogurt, instead of the air temperature. Due to its specific
      design, the eCube ensures that refrigeration keeps food at the
      correct temperature.<br>
      <br>
      When fitted to the thermostat sensor, which controls the
      compressor, the eCube significantly reduces the frequency of the
      refrigeration cycles as they are now based on food temperature
      rather than fluctuating air temperature.<br>
      <br>
      By using the eCube as a cycle control mechanism, refrigeration
      cycles last longer but can be reduced by as much as 80%.<br>
      <br>
      For example, a Dairy Case air cycles 3 minutes on, 2 minutes off =
      12 cycles per hour. With an eCube fitted, the cycles change to 8
      minutes on, 7 minutes off = 4 cycles per hour. This equates to a
      66.7% reduction in starts.<br>
      <br>
      As the start-up of a refrigerator compressor uses 3 times more
      power (i.e. start-up 12 amps, run 4 amps) considerable energy
      savings are achieved. In addition, the more efficient
      refrigeration cycle leads to a more efficient unit, which then
      leads to a colder storage area. Consequently, by re-adjusting the
      thermostat back to its normal temperature settings, there are
      further substantial energy savings, without compromising food
      safety and quality. <br>

      <b>[ Excerpt ]<br>
        <br>
      </b><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      This invention relates to a method and apparatus for controlling
      refrigeration apparatus. An example of the application of the
      invention is to a method and apparatus for controlling the
      operation of domestic and commercial food storage refrigeration
      apparatus including deep freeze apparatus. However, the invention
      also provides, as such, the apparatus which operates in accordance
      with the aforesaid method for controlling such refrigeration
      apparatus, and provides temperature sensing apparatus.<br>
      <br>
      Further aspects of the invention relate to the use of the method
      and apparatus for the control of apparatus for raising the
      temperature of food and the like, for example microwave cooking
      apparatus. Further aspects of the invention relate to a method and
      apparatus for conducting thermal tests and calibration in relation
      to refrigeration and heating apparatus.<br>
      <br>
      There is disclosed in WO 94/10546 (reference P51957WO) a method
      and apparatus applicable to temperature sensing in relation to
      refrigeration equipment in which provision is made for a means to
      enable visual inspection, of temperature sensing apparatus (for
      example a conventional bulb and meniscus column-type thermometer)
      which has been stored in a refrigerator and then removed for
      inspection, without the attendant inaccuracy of temperature
      measurement arising from immediate response of the thermometer to
      the raised air temperature outside the refrigerator or, if such
      inspection is effected without removal from the refrigerator, the
      effect of the ingress of external warm air into the refrigerator.<br>
      <br>
      For this purpose, the apparatus of the WO 546 specification
      provides for the thermometer to be entirely encased within a
      transparent capsule containing ethylene glycol.<br>
      <br>
      In this way the WO 546 apparatus seeks to offset the effect of
      sudden changes of air temperature on temperature sensing apparatus
      used in relation to refrigeration equipment.<br>
      <br>
      In a similar way, the disclosure in DE 30 32 684 A1 provides for
      the use of a thermal barrier material to surround the temperature
      sensor in a refrigerator in order that the effect of opening the
      door of the refrigerator will be cushioned.<br>
      <br>
      In the references cited against the WO 546 specification there are
      related disclosures concerning the use of thermal inertia and
      barrier systems for similar or related reasons.<br>
      <br>
      We have discovered that the technical approach adopted in these
      prior proposals to the sensing of temperatures in refrigeration
      apparatus and to the control of such apparatus, is technically
      subject to significant shortcomings in terms of seeking to
      alleviate the symptoms of the mallaise (inaccurate temperature
      sensing) without looking to see what is the actual technical step
      needed for the purpose in terms of the real function of the
      temperature sensing system.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      In accordance with the principles of our discovery, the proper
      basis for evaluating the only temperature of interest within a
      refrigerator (namely the temperature of the food therein enclosed)
      is to, in essence, sample the food temperature therein. Now, while
      invasive food temperature sampling by use of inserted probes and
      the like is fraught with practical difficulties and liberally
      fenced-around with food hygiene regulations, (so that actual food
      internal temperature sensing becomes a practical impossibility),
      we have discovered that there is a practical alternative approach
      which is not foreshadowed in the prior art, and in accordance with
      this principle the proper approach to the sensing of such
      temperatures is by internal sensing within a simulated body of
      food. Thus, in accordance with this approach, the method and
      apparatus of the invention provides the means whereby temperature
      can effectively be sensed from within food stored within the
      refrigerator, or in the case of a heating system (such as a
      microwave oven) from within food being heated in such a heating
      appliance.<br>
      <br>
      By adopting an approach in which, instead of seeking to damp out
      the effect of incoming warm air and providing instead the means to
      sense temperature from within the food itself, yet without the
      hygiene and related problems of invasive probes, there is provided
      a method and apparatus which has the capability of providing the
      user with that which he or she actually wants namely the
      temperature of the food in question.<br>
      <br>
      This latter factor is of great relevance, we have discovered,
      since although (as the prior art teaches) the air temperature
      within a refrigerator or deep freeze rises rapidly when the door
      is opened, the actual effect of the air temperature on the stored
      food is often quite marginal and there can be a temperature
      difference between the air and the stored food of 10[deg.] C. or
      more while an unmodified air temperature sensing system in a
      refrigerator (as is conventionally provided in domestic
      appliances) will react relatively wildly to such fluctuations, and
      such is obviously undesirable for energy conservation reasons.
      Equally there is the converse situation where the approach has
      been taken that such over-reaction of the temperature control
      system is ineffective and wasteful, but it is equally true that
      mere damping of the system is not the effective answer either
      because damping merely lowers the amplitude of the reactive peaks
      of the system without addressing the underlying problem or
      question.<br>
      <br>
      The method and apparatus of the embodiments of the present
      invention does address that underlying question and provides the
      means for addressing it in a repeatable and scientifically based
      manner which avoids the hygiene implications of invasive probes
      yet addresses the question to be answered directly without merely
      seeking to ameliorate the technical consequences of the problems
      which arise in practice with existing apparatus.<br>
      <br>
      Thus in the embodiments of the present invention the temperature
      sensor is located within a body of food simulant and at a distance
      from the surface thereof which corresponds to an average stored
      food article size, with the result that the sensed temperature
      corresponds closely to that of an article of food located
      alongside the food-simulant article within the refrigerator.<br>
      <br>
      Of course, in the case of a food article placed in the
      refrigerator a relatively short time previously, there will be the
      potential for temperature inaccuracy, but such temperature
      divergences are inherent in any temperature changing system of the
      refrigeration or heating kind, and the question to be addressed is
      how does the system respond (after newly-added articles have
      temperature-adjusted) to fluctuations caused by door-opening or
      automatic defrosting or the like?<br>
      <br>
      An important aspect of the embodiments of the present invention
      concerns the nature of the food simulant material itself, and in
      the principal embodiments described below the food simulant
      simulates food by being a material adapted for repetitive use over
      a significant period (whereby repetitious unacceptable servicing
      replacement in a regularly used domestic article of this kind is
      avoided), but which is capable of simultaneously responding
      thermally in the manner of a foodstuff by being such a material
      itself. Thus, the embodiments of the present invention as
      described below provide an exact simulation of the thermal
      properties of a foodstuff by providing for the selective use of a
      such a material itself to model the thermal characteristics
      required to be sensed. In this manner the embodiments enable the
      apparatus and method to provide a signal which can be used either
      for controlling refrigeration apparatus or for indicating food
      temperature, or indeed both, so as accurately to reflect the
      thermal behaviour of an item of foodstuff place alongside the
      temperature-sensing and food-simulating article. Actual examples
      of the materials to be employed are described below. These
      materials are usually in gel or wax-like format and thus require
      suitable encasement for practical handling in the refrigeration
      and/or heating appliance environment. Accordingly, the food
      simulant material is provided with a casing which typically may
      comprise a plastic moulding corresponding in size to a typical
      food article for refrigerational storage in the envisaged use
      environment, and which may additionally be provided with one or
      more further layers of material to simulate the thermal effects of
      packaging which is conventionally employed in relation to articles
      stored in refrigerators or deep freezers. This latter aspect of
      the thermal characteristics of the simulated article of food may
      be incorporated into the overall thermal package without the need
      for providing specific physical counterparts of the packaging as
      such. For example, the effect of such packaging might be
      reasonably closely approximated to by adopting a somewhat larger
      size for the overall simulated food article. However, such an
      approach is not strictly in accordance with the principles of some
      of the embodiments of the present invention, for which the
      approach is to adopt, for temperature sensing purposes, a
      simulated food article of a size corresponding to a typical stored
      food article and having within it not only simulated food with the
      temperature sensing device therein, but also simulated packaging
      to correspond with the conventional packaging, but not of course
      overlooking the requirement for durability in terms of the
      intended use of the device within the refrigeration or other
      apparatus over a period of years.<br>
      <br>
      In relation to the temperature sensing devices used in the
      embodiments of the invention themselves, conventional hardware may
      be employed and such will usually be in the form of
      electrically-responsive thermosensor means as employed in known
      refrigeration apparatus. From such a thermosensor, the output emf
      may be fed to the control port or input gate of the refrigeration
      apparatus control system and/or the corresponding connection of a
      digital or analogue thermal readout.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, using presently available technology, there will usually be
      a requirement for a hard-wired connection to the thermal sensing
      device within the food-simulating article and for this purpose
      suitable convenient and durable means may be provided. For
      example, in the case where the method and apparatus is employed
      for the control of the temperature of a refrigerator or deep
      freeze various approaches may be adopted to the positioning of the
      sensing article. In one approach the article may be a single
      article and chosen for placement within the refrigeration cabinet
      at a suitable location corresponding reasonably closely with that
      of the food article which will be most likely to affected by the
      thermal change (such as door opening) with which the system is
      intended to cope. Alternatively, a series of food-simulating
      articles may be provided within the thermal cabinet for placement
      amongst the food articles and with suitable hard-wiring
      connections, for example disconnectable plug-in connectors, though
      such is not deemed to be commercially attractive practical option
      for conventional domestic use, despite the fact that the hard
      wiring transmits voltages only of the order of millivolts.
      Alternative technical solutions to the signal transmission
      question may be evolved including wireless transmission or other
      transmission systems not requiring the physical use of hard wiring
      loose connectors. One option might be to provide a series of
      food-simulating articles plugged into the cabinet of the apparatus
      at suitable locations and from which the signals would be
      monitored and evaluated on an overall assessment basis.<br>
      <br>
      Another aspect of the invention relates to the use of the
      food-simulating article and the contained thermal sensor therein
      in relation to a method for controlling the operation of
      refrigeration or deep freeze apparatus so as to achieve
      significant energy savings in relation to power consumption for
      driving the pump of conventional refrigeration apparatus. In
      accordance with this aspect of the invention the control method
      and apparatus are adapted to provide a degree of control of the
      refrigerant pump (or other driveable thermal transfer apparatus)
      such that the extent of operation of the pump matches to a close
      approximation that which is actually required to produce the
      desired level of refrigeration of the food, avoiding the peaks and
      troughs associated with conventional control systems which sense
      air temperature only and the corresponding thermally damped peaks
      and troughs of the prior art apparatus discussed above. Thus,
      these embodiments of the invention provide improved refrigeration
      unit response pattern (in terms of pump drive periods and/or
      formal heat transfer quantum per unit time). This result is
      achieved by providing in accordance with the principles of the
      invention a refrigerant drive system control signal which is
      generated on the basis of a food-originating temperature-dependent
      control signal. This has the result that the power consumption of
      the refrigerant system matches the actual requirements of the
      apparatus and its enclosing cabinet instead of being related to
      relatively irrelevant factors such as the air temperature in the
      cabinet and/or a perceived requirement to damp the responsiveness
      of the control system. In this manner there are achieved
      significant energy savings which tests have indicated will
      frequently amount to as much as 33% of overall consumption.<br>
      <br>
      Accordingly, the embodiments of this aspect of the invention
      provide method and apparatus whereby energy conservation is
      achieved by driving the heat-transfer refrigeration apparatus in
      accordance with control signals derived from a sensor system
      providing control based upon signals effectively emanating from
      the very food within the temperature control cabinet which is to
      be temperature controlled, such signals being based upon a food
      simulant, which may indeed be a foodstuff itself, approximating in
      physical characteristics (including size and heat transfer
      properties) to an average or typical foodstuff to be stored. In
      this way there is provided a system in which the power consumption
      characteristics are based upon a model closely approximating to
      that which heat transfer theory would devise to conform with the
      objective of minimisation of fuel consumption for actual food
      refrigeration purposes.<br>

      temperature of the food simulant changes in the same way as food
      stored in its vicinity and is unaffected by the movement of the

      an accurate reading and recording of stored food temperature and
      the regulation of the temperature within an enclosed refrigerated
      space by a thermostat. Its uses are mainly for frozen, chilled and
      refrigerated food, but can extend to any refrigerated item that is
      concerned with staying at a constant temperature by desire or

      that it will decrease the amount of electrical energy used by the

      </div>
      <b> </b><br>
      The geometric arrangement of lines most commonly known as the
      swastika, has found a new application in photonics. <br>
      <br>
      Researchers at Southampton University have produced tens of
      thousands of gold swastika’s on a square millimetre to form new
      optical “metamaterials” that can artificially change the
      polarisation state of light.<br>
      <br>
      The swastika has number of special features, it is entirely made
      up of vertical and horizontal straight lines, it is square and yet
      can still provide the feeling of left-handed or right-handed
      rotation known as chirality. <br>
      <br>
      Dr Bagnall of Electronics and Computer Science at Southampton
      University says, “when we started to consider which chiral
      geometries would be most suitable for our experiments it was
      impossible for us to ignore the swastika, it's squareness equates
      to an absence of optical birefringence at normal incidence, and
      the straight horizontal and vertical lines can be readily drawn at
      nanolength scales using electron beam lithography.” <br>
      <br>
      The team at Southampton have found that the interaction between
      light and their two dimensional chiral metamaterials, can cause
      changes in the polarization state that were only previously
      observed as a result of interactions with three dimensional
      materials. The group are continuing to experiment with the wide
      range of chiral geometries, <br>
      <br>
      “Triskella (such as the symbol that represents the Isle of man),
      spirals and some chiral fractals can gain us additional
      functionality, and while we are still at an early stage in our
      experiments we can already anticipate applications in
      optoelectronics, laser physics and optical communications”, says
      Dr Bagnall. <br>
      <br>
      This is especially true, as technologists are increasingly using
      the polarization state as a means of carrying information in
      applications such as quantum cryptography…<br>

      <b> </b><br>
      A new recipe for "nanorust" could give developing nations a cheap
      tool for removing arsenic from drinking water. Arsenic
      contamination is linked to bladder cancer and is a big problem in
      many places, especially in Bangladesh and the neighbouring Indian
      state of West Bengal. <br>
      <br>
      Chemists know that arsenic binds particularly well to iron oxides,
      including rust, but practical techniques for doing this have been
      slow and laborious. <br>
      <br>
      Vicki Colvin and colleagues at Rice University in Houston, Texas,
      realised that the efficiency of this process could be improved by
      reducing the size of the iron oxide particles employed. This is
      because a given weight of smaller particles has more surface area
      available for binding than the same weight of larger particles. <br>
      <br>
      "One kilogram of nanorust has the same surface area as a football
      field," says Colvin. "Basically, you can treat a whole lot more
      arsenic with less material." <br>
      <br>
      The team added nanoscale iron oxide to contaminated water, where
      it clumped together with the arsenic. They then magnetised the
      nanoparticles with an electromagnet and pulled them out. <br>
      <br>
      "We only needed a surprisingly weak magnetic field," says Colvin.
      "In fact, we could pull then out with just a hand-held magnet,
      making this a very practical method." <br>
      <br>
      They believe that only a small field was needed because the
      magnetised nanoparticles line up to form a single giant magnet and
      drag each other along.<br>

      Chicago First Black Inventors Entrepreneurs now has 127 members in
      21 states. The organization is black-run and based in Chicago, but
      Flowers said that should not deter inventors of all stripes from
      contacting them. “We target people with limited resources,” said
      Daniels, who is now secretary of the company. Inventors have been
      vocally responsive, often calling the organization a godsend. At
      any given time, they have 100 patents or patents pending that
      members would likely not have pursued if they had been working
      alone. Thomas Ross invented a bike with three sprockets, making
      one half-turn of the pedal sufficient to power the bike for a half

      <br>
      A Berthold-area farmer and his crew are ready to take their
      invention into production. <br>
      <br>
      Their invention feeds discarded rubber tires into one end, and
      spits energy out the other end - in a process that the inventors
      say recovers almost every bit of energy expended to produce the
      tires. <br>
      <br>
      What's the big attraction? It seems Delta Energy has answered a
      question that scientists have been trying to answer for decades. <br>
      <br>
      What they've accomplished is a system to take one of the world's
      biggest pollution problems - discarded tires - some 300-million of
      them each year - and turn them into usable fuel. <br>
      <br>
      Alan Lee of Delta Energy say, "Each tire produces about 2.8, or
      the equivalent of 2.8 gallons of oil." <br>
      <br>
      Lee says 99 percent of the original tire is turned into something
      useful, from natural gas to diesel fuel to carbon that can be
      reused in the rubber and plastics industry. <br>
      <br>
      "It's energy friendly because we're returning fuel." <br>
      <br>
      But it's not a process that was arrived at easily - this gadget -
      Lee says it doesn't really have a name - they call it "the
      reactor" - was five years in the making - with many bumps along
      the road. <br>
      <br>
      Lee and Erickson say they're very close to getting the major
      financial support from a big-name company they need to spread out
      this technology across the nation. <br>
      <br>
      It's a technology that was made possible by a secret chemical
      compound that unlocked the door that was keeping rubber recycling
      from being clean and profitable. <br>
      <br>
      Duane Erickson of Delta Energy says, "That's our magic powder."<br>

            anything together</b><br>
        </big></div>
      <br>
      Researchers at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute have developed a
      new method to bond materials that don’t normally stick together.
      The team’s adhesive, which is based on self-assembling nanoscale
      chains, could impact everything from next-generation computer chip
      manufacturing to energy production.<br>
      <br>
      Less than a nanometer – or one billionth of a meter – thick, the
      nanoglue is inexpensive to make and can withstand temperatures far
      higher than what was previously envisioned. In fact, the
      adhesive’s molecular bonds strengthen when exposed to heat.<br>
      <br>
      The glue material is already commercially available, but the
      research team’s method of treating the glue to dramatically
      enhance its “stickiness” and heat resistance is completely new.
      The project, led by Rensselaer materials science and engineering
      professor Ganapathiraman Ramanath, is featured in the May 17 issue
      of the journal Nature.<br>
      <br>
      Like many key scientific discoveries, Ramanath and his team
      happened upon the novel, heat-hardened nanoglue by accident.<br>
      <br>
      For years Ramanath has investigated ways of assembling layers of
      molecular chains between two different materials to enhance the
      structural integrity, efficiency, and reliability of semiconductor
      devices in computer chips. His team has shown that molecular
      chains with a carbon backbone – ending with appropriate elements
      such as silicon, oxygen, or sulfur – can improve adhesion and
      prevent heat-triggered mixing of atoms of the adjoining
      substances. Recently, Ramanath’s group and other researchers have
      found these nanolayers to be useful for creating adhesives,
      lubricants, and protective surface coatings.<br>
      <br>
      The nanolayers, however, are extremely susceptible to heat and
      begin to degrade or simply detach from a surface when exposed to
      temperatures above 400 degrees Celsius. This severe limitation has
      precluded more widespread use of the nanolayers.<br>
      <br>
      Ramanath’s team decided to sandwich a nanolayer between a thin
      film of copper and silica, thinking the extra support would help
      strengthen the nanolayer’s bonds and boost its adhesive
      properties. It proved to be an insightful venture, and the
      research team found more than it bargained for.<br>
      <br>
      When exposed to heat, the middle layer of the “nanosandwich” did
      not break down or fall off – as it had nowhere to go. But that was
      not the only good news. The nanolayer’s bonds grew stronger and
      more adhesive when exposed to temperatures above 400 degrees
      Celsius. Constrained between the copper and silica, the
      nanolayer’s molecules hooked onto an adjoining surface with
      unexpectedly strong chemical bonds.<br>
      <br>
      “The higher you heat it, the stronger the bonds are,” Ramanath
      said. “When we first started out, I had not imagined the molecules
      behaving this way.”<br>
      <br>
      To make sure it wasn’t a fluke, his team recreated the test more
      than 50 times over the past two years. The results have been
      consistent, and show heating up the sandwiched nanolayer increases
      its interface toughness – or “stickiness” – by five to seven
      times. Similar toughness has been demonstrated using
      micrometer-thick layers, but never before with a nanometer-thick
      layer. A nanometer is 1,000 times smaller than a micrometer.<br>
      <br>
      Because of their small size, these enhanced nanolayers will likely
      be useful as adhesives in a wide assortment of micro- and
      nanoelectronic devices where thicker adhesive layers just won’t
      fit.<br>
      <br>
      Another unprecedented aspect of Ramanath’s discovery is that the
      sandwiched nanolayers continue to strengthen up to temperatures as
      high as 700 degrees Celsius. The ability of these adhesive
      nanolayers to withstand and grow stronger with heat could have
      novel industrial uses, such as holding paint on hot surfaces like
      the inside of a jet engine or a huge power plant turbine.<br>
      <br>
      Along with nanoscale and high heat situations, Ramanath is
      confident the new nanoglue will have other unforeseen uses.<br>
      <br>
      “This could be a versatile and inexpensive solution to connect any
      two materials that don’t bond well with each other,” Ramanath
      said. “Although the concept is not intuitive at first, it is
      simple, and could be implemented for a wide variety of potential
      commercial applications.<br>
      <br>
      “The molecular glue is inexpensive – 100 grams cost about $35 –
      and already commercially available, which makes our method
      well-suited to today’s marketplace. Our method can definitely be
      scaled up to meet the low-cost demands of a large manufacturer,”
      he said.<br>
      <br>
      Ramanath and his team have filed a disclosure on their findings
      and are moving forward toward a patent, which will complement the
      robust portfolio of other intellectual property they hold in this
      field. The team is also exploring what happens when certain
      variables of the nanoglue are tweaked, such as making taller
      nanolayers or sandwiching the layers between substances other than
      copper and silica.<br>
      <br>
      Along with Ramanath, Rensselaer materials science and engineering
      graduate students Darshan Gandhi and Amit Singh contributed to the
      paper. Other co-authors include Rensselaer physics professor Saroj
      Nayak and graduate student Yu Zhou, IBM researcher Michael Lane at
      the T.J. Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights, N.Y., and
      Ulrike Tisch and Moshe Eizenberg of the Technion-Israel Institute
      of Technology.<br>
      <br>
      Ramanath’s ongoing research is supported by the National Science
      Foundation, the U.S.-Israel Binational Science Foundation, the
      Alexander von Humboldt Foundation, and New York state through the
      Interconnect Focus Center.<br>
      <br>
      LaVerne Hess, the NSF program official most familiar with
      Ramanath’s work, applauded the interdisciplinary nature and strong
      technical relevance of the nanoglue project.<br>
      <br>
      “It’s a good example of basic materials science research motivated
      by an understanding of engineering needs in the electronics field,
      and involving fundamental chemistry concepts to create new
      materials capabilities to enable progress in a field important to
      U.S. competitiveness,” Hess said.<br>

            Panel Can Change the World</b></big><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      SALEM, Utah--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Following a successful high-volume
      run of its new breakthrough solar panels, International Automated
      Systems, Inc. (OTCBB:IAUS) has been conducting tests to identify
      the parameters of its new product. The new panels have delivered
      an exciting performance that is in line with preliminary
      expectations.<br>
      <br>
      IAUS’s unique thin-film solar panels have a solar insolence
      transmittance efficiency of nearly 92%- virtually the highest
      transmittance physically possible of any material. These
      breakthrough solar panels have shown a conversion of solar energy
      from the sun into temperatures of over 1,300 degrees F.<br>
      <br>
      Initial IAUS data has demonstrated that IAUS’s new solar panels
      focus as high as 30% more solar energy onto its receiver than
      traditional solar power trough systems typically achieve. Recent
      advancements will likely increase this number again to more than
      50%. IAUS’s solar panels have an estimated life-span of greater
      than fifty years when properly maintained, and are inexpensive to
      replace.<br>
      <br>
      IAUS’s unique thin-film solar panel can be produced at a fraction
      of the cost of today’s traditional photovoltaic solar panels. IAUS
      believes its new product is the first solar power technology with
      legitimate potential to compete with gas and other fossil fuels.
      Low-cost energy produced by IAUS’s new patented and patent-pending
      solar technology can be used to generate electricity or produce
      clean fuels such as hydrogen and green methanol (gasoline
      replacements) at a competitive price. Many experts had predicted
      that no solar power technology would likely accomplish this
      milestone before the year 2025.<br>
      <br>
      During its first high-volume run, nearly 1,000 Kilowatts of IAUS’s
      solar panels were manufactured in a short 24-hour period. On a
      24/7 operating schedule, an estimated 350 Megawatts of IAUS panels
      can be produced annually. In comparison, a traditional
      photovoltaic (PV) solar module manufacturing plant with a yearly
      capacity equal to IAUS would cost an estimated $840 Million to
      construct. <br>
      <br>
      <b>http://www.iaus.com/home.html</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Solar Panels- IAUS’s panel fabrication is a unique, patented,
      molding process never-before done with a radial Fresnel lens. This
      process allows for inexpensive, high-volume, mass production that
      can be expanded for ultra-high volumes in a comparatively short
      amount of time.<br>
      <br>
      These thin solar panels focus the sun’s energy to a small,
      high-temperature point. The energy generated can be used for both
      electricity production and thermal heat for manufacturing, water
      purification, chemical refinement, and other heat-based processes.<br>

            Turbine </b></big><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Coal-fired steam plant turbines are costly, high maintenance,
      large, difficult to manufacture, extremely temperamental, and
      dangerous. IAUS’s patented, bladeless turbine has none of these
      issues. While maintaining similar efficiencies as today’s
      expensive steam turbines, IAUS’s turbine is small, low-cost,
      scalable, and operates minus most of the expensive surrounding
      components and maintenance issues.<br>
      <br>
      Traditional turbine performance relies upon the environment within
      its blade chambers. Super-heated, high-velocity steam particles
      are continuously striking the titanium turbine blades to turn the
      shaft. If steam condenses on the blades, a sharp drop in
      efficiency and damage to the turbine can result. Traditional
      multi-stage turbines require dry, high-quality steam.<br>
      <br>
      IAUS’s new turbine is structurally unaffected by low quality
      steam. It blows the energy away from its components instead of on
      them to turn the shaft. As mentioned, it is smaller than
      traditional turbines, less expensive, and requires very little
      maintenance, and because of its low-pressure working chamber, it
      is much less dangerous. Also, unlike traditional turbines, IAUS’s
      turbine can operate without corrosion or system failure on both
      high quality and low quality steam. It has bi-phase flow
      capability.<br>
      <b><br>
      </b><b>IAUS Turbine Eliminates Need for Boiler</b><br>
      <br>
      IAUS’s proprietary turbine steam cycle does not need an expensive,
      sophisticated, high-maintenance boiler. Instead IAUS’s turbine
      operates on high-pressure, super heated water (supercritical
      fluid) from a series of high-pressure tubing, which is much safer,
      less expensive and easier to manage. The expansion or phase change
      (flashing) from water to steam happens right in the working
      chamber of IAUS’s turbine. This makes the Balance of Plant (BOP)
      steam production, and monitoring equipment less complicated. These
      are significant advantages over traditional boiler systems
      required by conventional turbines.<br>
      <b><br>
      </b><b>Modular</b><br>
      <br>
      IAUS’s turbine can be custom designed for smaller to medium size
      applications. This allows for staging power in and out, and
      inexpensively segmenting a power plant into smaller sectors which
      improves issues of downtime while offering low-cost redundancy in
      on-site equipment.<br>

            cheaper than gasoline</b></big><br>
        <br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
      PORTLAND, Ore. — The hydrogen economy is getting a shot in the arm
      from a start-up that says its nanoparticle coatings could make
      hydrogen easy to produce at home from distilled water, and
      ultimately bring the cost of hydrogen fuel cells in line with that
      of fossil fuels.<br>
      <br>
      QuantumSphere Inc. says it has perfected the manufacture of highly
      reactive catalytic nanoparticle coatings that could up the
      efficiency of electrolysis, the technique that generates hydrogen
      from water. Moreover, the coatings could also eliminate the need
      for expensive metals like platinum in hydrogen fuel cells.<br>
      <br>
      Boasting 1,000 times the surface area of traditional materials,
      the coatings can be used to retrofit existing electrolysers to
      increase their efficiency to 85 percent -- exceeding the
      Department of Energy's goal for 2010 by 10 percent. The scheme
      holds the promise of 96 percent efficiency by the time cars
      powered by hydrogen fuel cells hit automobile showrooms, according
      to the Santa Ana, Calif., company.<br>
      <br>
      "Instead of switching 170,000 gas stations over to hydrogen, using
      our electrodes could enable consumers to make their own hydrogen,
      either in the garage or right on the vehicle," said Kevin Maloney,
      president, chief executive officer and co-founder of
      QuantumSphere. "Our nanoparticle-coated electrodes make
      electrolysers efficient enough to provide hydrogen on demand from
      a tank of distilled water in your car."<br>
      <br>
      The first commercial product inspired by QuantumSphere's
      technology will debut later this year: a battery using a cathode
      coated with the startup's nanoparticles, thereby increasing its
      energy density 5x over alkaline cells and boosting power by 320
      percent. The first commercial nonrechargeable batteries with this
      increased capacity will be announced by an as-yet-unnamed major
      U.S. battery maker in the second half of 2008.<br>
      <br>
      QuantumSphere also claims to be able to improve rechargeable
      nickel-metal-hydride batteries to the point where they perform
      better than the less environmentally friendly lithium-ion
      batteries popular today.<br>
      <br>
      QuantumSphere's plan is first to retrofit existing electrolysis
      equipment with its nanoparticle electrodes to boost efficiency.
      Next, it intends to partner with original equipment manufacturers
      to design at-home and on-vehicle electrolysers for making hydrogen
      from water for fuel cells. Finally, the company wants to work with
      fuel cell makers to replace their expensive platinum electrodes
      with inexpensive stainless-steel electrodes coated with
      nickel-iron nanoparticles.<br>
      <br>
      QuantumSphere's nanoparticles are available in four formulations:
      nickel cobalt, iron cobalt, nickel iron and silver copper.
      According to the Freedonia Group Inc. (Cleveland), the
      nanoparticles can be sold directly into the catalyst metals
      market, which it predicts will edge up to $4.7 billion this year.
      <br>
      <br>
      QuantumSphere is also expected to have an impact on the battery
      market, which Freedonia estimates will grow to more than $5
      billion by 2009. Portable fuel cells and direct hydrogen
      generation are markets that are growing even faster, with fuel
      cells estimated to top $11 billion by 2013, according to
      Wintergreen Research Inc. (Lexington, Mass.), and hydrogen
      generation to exceed $15 billion by 2016, according to Clean Edge
      Inc. (Portland, Ore.).<br>
      <br>
      QuantumSphere was founded in 2002 with just $100,000 of private
      funding and still has not taken in any venture capital, although
      it did have a public funding round last year. The company's
      founding goal was to create a thimble full of the nanoparticles it
      invented. But now, just over five years later, it claims to have
      surpassed its original goal with a manufacturing plant capable of
      producing tons of nanoparticles per year.<br>
      <br>
      QuantumSphere claims its current manufacturing capacity is enough
      for both the battery and electrolysis markets. With an eye on
      future growth, however, the company has partnered with the OM
      Group Inc. (Cleveland) for mass-producing nanoparticles when
      QuantumSphere can no longer meet demand.<br>
      <br>
      After perfecting the original invention, for which QuantumSphere
      was awarded a patent last year, the company hired an engineering
      team to adapt the nanoparticles for particular applications.
      Leading that team was director of fuel cell research Kimberly
      McGrath, a protg of George Olah, the 1994 Nobel Prize winner in
      chemistry. Olah, inventor of the direct liquid-methanol fuel cell,
      serves as a scientific adviser to QuantumSphere.<br>
      <br>
      "We have formulated a nanoparticle coating that has a very high
      surface area, enabling inexpensive coated stainless-steel
      electrodes to exceed the performance of the expensive platinum
      electrodes used today," said McGrath. "We start with raw material
      that covers about the size of a sheet of paper, but after
      converting into nanoparticles, it covers a soccer field."<br>
      <br>
      The nanoparticles are perfect spheres, consisting of a couple
      hundred atoms measuring from 16 to 25 nanometers in diameter. They
      are formed by means of a vacuum-deposition process that uses vapor
      condensation to produce highly reactive catalytic nanoparticles,
      for which the engineering team has formulated several end-use
      applications.<br>
      <br>
      "Our biggest engineering challenge was finding a way to get the
      nanoparticles to stick to metal electrodes," McGrath said. The
      company has solved that problem, she said, "enabling existing
      electrolysis equipment to realize a 30 percent increase in
      hydrogen output just by retrofitting our coated electrodes."<br>
      <br>
      QuantumSphere projects that the efficiency of electrolysis using
      its nanoparticle-coated electrodes, now at 85 percent, can be
      increased to 96 percent by the time hydrogen fuel cell automobiles
      are in wide use. Adjusting for rising gasoline prices,
      QuantumSphere projects that performing electrolysis at home to
      power hydrogen fuel cells will then be less expensive than burning
      fossil fuels.<br>
      <br>
      The company has also made progress in its quest to eliminate the
      need for expensive platinum electrodes inside the fuel cell
      itself, claiming that today it can replace half a fuel cell's
      platinum with nanoparticle-coated stainless steel. QuantumSphere
      hopes to demonstrate fuel cells with no platinum at all in the
      coming years. <br>

            Protection Has Just Been Leaked</b></big><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Up and coming site http://www.gas-miser.com offers a rare and
      effective engine metal treatment that can provide vast
      improvements to a variety of vehicles.<br>
      <br>
      A revolutionary engine product is becoming more available to the
      public thanks to http://www.gas-miser.com. For years, specialized
      mechanics in the aircraft, racing and transport industries have
      been using a product called Microlon to increase their engine's
      performance and life. This remarkable invention helps reduce
      friction in all functions of the engine, making it more efficient
      and causing less overall wear. This promotes a list of benefits,
      like increased gas mileage, more horsepower and longer engine
      life.<br>
      <br>
      It's important to distinguish this treatment from oil or fuel
      additives. Microlon engine metal treatment gives more effective
      friction reduction than any lubricant on the market today, yet it
      works in conjunction with conventional lube to give optimal
      performance and protection. The treatment is so effective, it
      lasts the entire life of an engine and never wears out. In
      addition to improved gas mileage and horsepower, the more
      efficient engine will have reduced exhaust emissions, thus
      protecting the environment.<br>
      <br>
      In fact, studies show that engines treated with Microlon have
      reduced hydrocarbon emissions by 24 percent, carbon monoxide by 43
      percent and nitrous oxide by 21 percent. An independent study by
      Porsche revealed that the treatment increased fuel economy by
      almost 10 percent. By that measure, the savings that a customer
      will experience will pay for the product in the first year alone.
      A motorcycle company reported an 11 percent increase in horsepower
      in one of their main models. Many other tests results show
      astonishing improvements in other factors of engine performance,
      all of which are available on the website.<br>
      <br>
      According to the U.S. Department of Energy, only 12 percent of the
      energy from the gasoline burned in an automobile engine goes to
      moving the tires; the remaining energy gets wasted in various
      ways. By far, the largest waste is due to engine friction,
      constituting 62 percent of the initial energy supply. Much of this
      friction is due to metal-on-metal contact. By adding Microlon,
      high quality resins embed themselves into the metal, making the
      surface contact points very slippery, thus allowing more energy to
      affect the drive train.<br>
      <br>
      Clearly, the benefits of this technology are extensive, and they
      apply to diesel and gas engines, aircraft, boat and snowmobile
      engines. On top of the performance benefits, the one-time use is
      only about twice as expensive as a regular oil change, and most
      consumers can do the installation themselves. To further entice
      its interested parties, the site is now offering Microlon at a 10
      percent discount from the factory direct price, as well as free
      shipping on all orders. Visit http://www.gas-miser.com to get more
      information about engine protection with this revolutionary
      product.<br>

      Friction in your Engine. What every car and truck owner ought to
      know … that most mechanics don’t.<br>
      <br>
      Microlon Engine Treatment will increase your gas mileage up to 8
      MPG, and increase your horsepower by up to 12%. Microlon Is Not An
      Oil Additive, It Is a Metal Treatment. Microlon is a
      Scientifically Advanced Metal Technology used By Aircraft and Race
      Car Mechanics, Fleet Mechanics, and even Metal Tooling, for More
      Than 30 Years ... Because It Works. The FAA has approved Microlon
      Since 1978, For Use In Aircraft Engines.<br>
      <br>
      Microlon was awarded the “Medaille De Vermeil” at the “Salon
      International des Techniques Nouvelles” in Geneva, Switzerland, in
      1978, for being the first among its class of new product
      innovations. This was only the 7th time in 100 years the award has

      <b>About Us</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Microlon's first product, known then as WZ-127, was created in
      1964 by Bill Williams, inventor of the Microlon Metal Treatment.
      At that time Mr. Williams was working as a gunsmith on weapons and
      sold modified .223 caliber ammunition to be used in .17 rifles.
      This bullet, which used a huge charge of powder, created a
      tremendous amount of heat due to friction where the bullet came in
      contact with the rifling of the barrel. This friction caused a
      considerable amount of wear and ruined new barrels after only a
      few hundred rounds. To solve this problem, he developed a liquid
      that combined a cleaning complex with a durable anti-friction
      resin. The compound was held in a powerful suspension agent to
      ensure even distribution down the length of the barrel. He
      garnered immediate success with this product as it extended the
      life of the .17 caliber barrels used in testing. Soon, he began to
      realize the potential of other applications. Viewing the gun
      barrel as a single-stroke engine, where the bullet acted as a
      piston and the inside of the barrel acted as a cylinder wall, he
      began developing and testing a formula that would treat automotive
      engines.<br>
      <br>
      In 1978 he entered this invention and won the coveted first place
      medal "Medaille de Vermeil" at the SALON INTERNATIONAL DES
      INVENTIONS DE GENEVE in Geneva, Switzerland. This noted win still
      stands unchallenged today! In 1979 he developed the CL-100
      Aircraft Formulation for aircrafts and after exhaustive testing by
      the FAA was granted certification for usage. Over the years,
      Microlon has grown in reputation as the best one-time metal
      treatment to use for lubricating and reducing friction in
      everything from jet engines, machinery, car engines, firearms,
      bicycle chains to pocket knives. Today distribution is both
      national and international.<br>
      <br>
      The focus of the business remains the same today as it was 40
      years ago; offer the finest products possible utilizing
      state-of-the-art treatment technology. Microlon believes in great
      customer service, old-fashioned hard work and continues to expand
      and improve their product lines through constant research and
      development.<br>
      <br>
      <b>FAQ</b><br>
      <br>
      WHY SHOULD I USE MICROLON? <br>
      Microlon works by reducing friction inside of your engine and
      helps it to operate more efficiently. An engine that has been
      Microlon-treated will save you real dollars by reducing wear and
      tear, increasing fuel economy, and cutting down on trips to the
      shop for unscheduled maintenance. An engine that operates more
      efficiently will feel more powerful. Since Microlon is a one-time
      treatment, you can enjoy the benefits of a smoother,<br>
      <br>
      WHY ISN'T MICROLON A MORE FAMOUS BRAND NAME? <br>
      For over 40 years, Microlon has been successfully selling
      treatment products by word-of-mouth advertising from enthusiastic
      customers. Unlike the majority of our competitors, Microlon is a
      family-owned business and does not have the huge corporation
      funding needed to pay for advertising campaigns. However,from this
      grass-roots growth within the enthusiast and car buff communities,
      Microlon has become known as the only one-time metal treatment to
      use. About 20 years ago we expanded into the International market
      though KYOWA Developing and Materials, Inc., a distributor in
      Japan, where the Microlon brand has become a well-known household
      name.<br>
      <br>
      WHAT ABOUT OTHER PRODUCTS THAT MAKE SIMILAR CLAIMS? <br>
      Microlon has been in business since 1964 and we have seen dozens
      of similar products come and go. Most of the other products are
      oils or oil treatments while Microlon is a one-time metal
      treatment. Microlon can be used to treat the top end of the engine
      through the fuel and the rest of the engine through the crankcase.
      Microlon CL-100 has been accepted for use in aircraft engines up
      to 1000 C.I.D. since May 1979. Microlon was entered into an
      invention competition and won the gold Medaille de Vermeille in
      Geneva in 1978. No one has been able to duplicate the formulation
      or its effects since it was invented in 1964.<br>
      <br>
      WILL MICROLON STOP AN ENGINE FROM BURNING OIL? <br>
      Microlon will reduce oil consumption if the problem is caused by
      sticking rings. Rings stick if deposits of carbon and varnish form
      on the rings or ring grooves. These deposits slow down or stop
      normal ring action. The cleaning complex in Microlon attacks the
      bad deposits and leaves behind the Microlon film which helps your
      engine run smoothly and efficiently.<br>
      <br>
      DO I USE MICROLON ON EVERY OIL CHANGE? <br>
      NO! Microlon is a ONE-TIME treatment of the metal inside of your
      engine,not an EVERY TIME treatment to the oil. Using Microlon
      treatment is a one time investment in the life of your car.<br>
      <br>
      DOES THE OIL HAVE TO BE CHANGED BEFORE TREATMENT? <br>
      Due to the tremendous cleansing action of Microlon, deposits of
      carbon and varnish are put into suspension in the lubrication
      system. These by-products of imperfect combustion may put a burden
      on the filtering system. So it is advisable, especially in older
      engines, to change the oil before treating your engine with
      Microlon.<br>
      <br>
      HOW MUCH MICROLON DOES MY ENGINE NEED? <br>
      Microlon treats the metal in your engine not the oil. Engines have
      various cubic inch displacement. Microlon treats each engine
      according to the total amount of surfaces that need friction
      reduction, different amounts of metal and different Microlon
      needs. Microlon engine treatments have two parts. The 4 ounce Fuel
      System treatment goes in with the fuel. Most of the Microlon
      liquid used to treat an engine goes into the crankcase. The chart
      below will help you get the right amount of Microlon for your
      car's engine.<br>
      <br>
      Diesel engines have different requirements. Please call (512)
      295-9895 for diesel specifications.<br>
      <br>
      WHY DOES A DIESEL ENGINE REQUIRE ADDITIONAL PRODUCT? <br>
      The Microlon resin is driven deeper into the pore structure of the
      metal by the higher compression found in diesel engines. Since the
      benefits of the Microlon film come from Microlon-to-Microlon
      contact inside of the engine, more product is required to
      adequately form the film. It is the Microlon film on the surface
      of the metal that protects the engine from wear. Turbo-charged and
      Super turbo-charged diesel engines have even higher than normal
      compression and require more Microlon liquid than an average
      diesel engine.<br>
      <br>
      HOW LONG DO I LEAVE MICROLON IN BEFORE CHANGING MY OIL? <br>
      The Microlon film forms within 1,000 miles (1,600 km) in
      automobiles. This time is needed for the Microlon resin to get
      burnished into the pore structure of the metal and form the
      protective micro-thin film. At this point, you should check your
      oil. If the Microlon cleaning complex has removed deposits from
      your engine, the oil will be dirty and should be changed to
      prevent stress on your filtering system. Any resin that is unused
      will come out with the dirty oil. Microlon will not change
      tolerances or replace metal which had been worn away.<br>
      <br>
      WHY DO I PUT MICROLON IN THE FUEL? <br>
      Unlike oil additives, Microlon is a metal treatment. Microlon is
      compatible with gasoline, diesel and oil. The fluids in the engine
      are used only to carry the Microlon resin to all of the bearing
      surfaces reached by those fluids. The Microlon added to the fuel
      treats the top end of the engine, while the Microlon added to the
      crankcase treats the rest of the engine.<br>
      <br>
      IS IT POSSIBLE TO OVERTREAT? <br>
      When you treat your engine with Microlon the first time, the
      Microlon resin is forced into the pore structure of the metal.
      When the micro-thin film has formed and no more resin can be
      squeezed into the surface of the metal, the rest of the Microlon
      resin will hang in suspension until your next oil change when it
      goes out with the waste oil. Additional treatments will not form a
      better film than the first one, so continually re-treating an
      engine is a waste of money.<br>
      <br>
      HOW MUCH INCREASED FUEL ECONOMY WILL I GET? <br>
      It is hard to state an exact amount of fuel savings coming from
      using the Microlon metal treatment because every engine is
      different. Typically, we give a benefit of 10% in fuel savings,
      but if you use the benefits of Microlon to get a little more power
      out of your engine, the horse power will go up and not the miles
      per gallon (or gallons per hour for aviation users). One of the
      other real benefits of the protective Microlon film is savings in
      the long term on maintenance and extended engine life.<br>
      <br>
      HOW LONG WILL THE MICROLON TREATMENT LAST? <br>
      The Microlon film will last until removed. Microlon penetrates the
      pore structure of the metal and becomes an integral part of the
      metal. In a properly treated engine all wear happens at
      Microlon-to-Microlon surfaces instead of metal-to-metal surfaces,
      reducing friction. The micro-thin film can only be removed by
      machining it out or by heating the metal to 775 degrees
      Fahrenheit. If the film is damaged by anything that makes it past
      the air filter, the Microlon film has a self-healing property that
      will repair and thin spots or scuffs. There are millions of
      engines that are performing as well today as when they were first
      treated.<br>
      <br>
      HOW DOES MICROLON WORK IN A MOTORCYCLE WITH A WET CLUTCH? <br>
      Forming the Microlon film is important in a wet clutch or a
      positraction limited slip rear differential, because they are high
      friction environments. The Microlon resin does not stick to the
      fiber in the wet clutch plates, but it does allow for easier
      action in the splines. Using Microlon reduces clutch hang up and
      reduces wear.<br>
      <br>
      CAN MICROLON HARM AN ENGINE? <br>
      The Microlon engine treatment works in two stages. First, the
      Microlon cleaning complex clears the engine of the carbon,
      varnish, and sludge that can accumulate through normal use. After
      the engine is clean, the Microlon film forms on the bearing
      surfaces. None of that process is inherently harmful to any
      engine. There have been a couple of cases where we have
      recommended that an engine not be treated, and those cases dealt
      with very old engines that were essentially held together by the
      gunk that Microlon will remove. Microlon Incorporated has full
      faith in its products and is proud to offer their customers a
      three-year unconditional money back guarantee.<br>
      <br>
      WILL MICROLON VOID MY WARRANTY? <br>
      No. To void a warranty the equipment manufacturer must prove that
      a particular product did damage to an engine. There is nothing in
      Microlon to damage an engine when properly used. Although many
      original equipment manufacturers threaten to 'void the warranty'
      if recommended lubricants are not used, none of them will put it
      in writing. The Microlon CL-100 aircraft engine treatment has been
      accepted for use in aircraft engines by the FAA since May 1979. In
      thirty-five years, there has never been a damage claim against any
      Microlon products.<br>
      <br>
      HOW LONG WILL MICROLON EXTEND THE LIFE OF AN ENGINE? <br>
      We cannot state that definitely. Oil analysis reports consistently
      show wear at an average of 75% to 100% greater in an untreated
      engine. We can quote from the Aviation Consumer (June 1, 1978
      issue) which reported on tests conducted by Caterpillar. These
      tests showed an estimated increase of expected engine life of
      between 20% and 40%. Since Microlon is a one-time treatment, the
      Microlon film will last the life of the engine, however long that
      may be.<br>
      <br>
      DOES MICROLON JUST WORK IN ENGINES? <br>
      Microlon can be used anywhere it would be beneficial to reduce
      friction. Microlon Incorporated manufactures a product called Gun
      Juice which is formulated for use in firearms. Microlon can be
      used on bicycle chains, squeaky hinges and pocket knives to name a
      few of the places you want to reduce friction and preserve metal.
      Microlon should never be used anywhere friction is beneficial,
      such as automotive brake systems.<br>
      <br>
      CAN I SPLIT A LARGE CONTAINER OF MICROLON TO TREAT SEVERAL SMALL
      ENGINES? <br>
      Yes. Just keep in mind, inexact measuring can result in an under
      treatment which might keep the Microlon film from forming, or over
      treatment which could result in wasted money. Microlon
      Incorporated suggests purchasing the recommended amount of product
      required to treat a specific engine or piece of equipment.
      Microlon packages its products in sizes from 1 ounce containers to
      55 gallon drums.<br>
      <br>
      CAN I USE MICROLON IN TWO CYCLE ENGINES? <br>
      Yes. The Microlon film reduces friction and enhances performance
      in all sizes and types of engines. Treating a two-cycle engine
      with Microlon is easier than treating other types of engines.
      Microlon treating a two-cycle engine does not require separate
      amounts in the oil and fuel since they are already combined. Just
      follow the instructions supplied by the Microlon Corporation.<br>
      <br>
      HOW MUCH DIFFERENCE CAN MICROLON MAKE ON A NEW ENGINE? <br>
      In new engines, Microlon acts as a preventative maintenance
      measure. The durable Microlon film will increase efficiency,
      giving greater fuel economy or greater horse power. The longer an
      engine runs, the greater the chance for dramatic performance
      decay. The more problems and engine has, the bigger difference
      Microlon can make.<br>
      <br>
      DOES THE MICROLON FILM DETERIORATE FROM HIGH TEMPERATURES OR ACIDS
      FOUND IN THE ENGINE? <br>
      No. The Microlon film is resistant to harmful chemicals and acids.
      The Microlon film will withstand continuous operating temperatures
      much higher than those present in an engine.<br>
      <br>
      WHY DOES AN ENGINE WITH AN ALUMINUM BLOCK REQUIRE ADDITIONAL
      PRODUCT? <br>
      The Microlon resin fills in the pore structure of the metal inside
      of the engine. Since aluminum has a much more open pore structure,
      more of the Microlon resin is required to fill in the surface of
      the metal and form the Microlon film. The key to the Microlon
      effect is forming the film and it simply takes more product to
      fill in the pore structure of the metal in an aluminum block.<br>
      <br>
      HOW IS AN ENGINE TREATED IF IT HAS A FRANTZ TYPE OIL FILTER? <br>
      The particles of the Microlon resin range in size and some of the
      larger particles may not pass through the Frantz type oil filter.
      This cartridge must be removed or by-passed during the treatment
      period to avoid a possible loss of some of the particulate. A
      Frantz type oil filter resembles a toilet paper roll, not a
      conventional oil filter. Nothing is bigger than 5 microns. <br>

      <b>Microlon vs. Oil Additives</b><br>
      <br>
      In any discussion about Microlon it is interesting to note that
      this product was not developed as an automotive "additive" but as
      a lubricant for high velocity rifles. The engine and multitude of
      other uses and applications were only realized after the use of
      the product for many years in its' originally intended
      mode.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unlike oil "additives", Microlon does not
      attempt to increase the lubricity of the oil. Microlon treats the
      actual metal surfaces and simply uses the oil, fuel, water,
      grease, cutting fluids, etc., as a transportation medium.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Most Oil Additives Have Shortcomings</b><br>
      <br>
      Oil additives usually come under the classifications of:<br>
      <br>
      chlorides<br>
      sulfur compounds<br>
      phopsphorus compounds<br>
      nitrogen compounds <br>
      <br>
      They have the following disadvantages:<br>
      <br>
      Chlorine compounds: Oils blend with chlorine compounds show an
      increase in film strength. It is common for those selling chlorine
      based oil additives to demonstrate the high film strength on the
      Timken or similar bearing machine. However, the most stable of
      chlorine compounds, when burned on the cylinder surface or piston
      tops, form hydrochloric acid which is corrosive. It is also known
      that chlorides add to oil drag.<br>
      <br>
      Sulfur compounds: Sulfur compounds also add to film strength.
      However, in high temperatures and the presence of moisture they
      are apt to break down. They thus produce corrosion and high
      resistance to motion.<br>
      <br>
      Phosphorous compounds: Phosphorous compounds likewise breakdown
      with the result being corrosive phosphorous acid.<br>
      <br>
      Nitrogen compounds: At elevated temperatures the oil film will
      break down and the bearings seize. Invariably, the presence of the
      above materials which increase the extreme pressure (E.P.)
      qualities of lubricants cause it to have high drag and produce
      early bearing fatigue. Therefore some additives which are in
      common use could produce relatively rapid engine deterioration.<br>
      <br>
      Metal treatment: Metal treatments are supposed to treat the metal
      only and not change the characteristics of oils. Some oil
      additives claim to be metal treatments, but by using bearing test
      machines to demonstrate the immediate increase in film strength of
      oil and when having to be used regularly, it's apparent to see
      they are more of an oil additive than an actual metal treatment
      and probably fall into one of the above classifications. <br>
      <br>
      <b>MICROLON</b><br>
      <br>
      Microlon is a one time metal treatment using oil and fuel only as
      a carrier for the Microlon resin. Results from using a bearing
      test machine to demonstrate Microlon usually turn out negative
      because Microlon is a true and proven metal treatment only. <br>

      <div align="center"><i>A new process uses sunlight and a
          nanostructured catalyst to inexpensively and efficiently
          generate hydrogen for fuel. </i><i><br>
        </i></div>
      <br>
      Nanoptek, a startup based in Maynard, MA, has developed a new way
      to make hydrogen from water using solar energy. The company says
      that its process is cheap enough to compete with the cheapest
      approaches used now, which strip hydrogen from natural gas, and it
      has the further advantage of releasing no carbon dioxide. The
      technology uses titania, a cheap and abundant material, to capture
      energy from sunlight. The absorbed energy releases electrons,
      which split water to make hydrogen. <br>
      <br>
      Other researchers have used titania to split water in the past,
      but Nanoptek researchers found a way to modify titania to absorb
      more sunlight, which makes the process much cheaper and more
      efficient, says John Guerra, the company's founder and CEO. Guerra
      says that chip makers have long known that straining a material so
      that its atoms are slightly pressed together or pulled apart
      alters the material's electronic properties. He found that
      depositing a coating of titania on dome-like nanostructures caused
      the atoms to be pulled apart. <br>
      <br>
      "When you pull the atoms apart, less energy is required to knock
      the electrons out of orbit," he says. "That means you can use
      light with lower energy--which means visible light" rather than
      just ultraviolet light. The strain on the atoms also affects the
      way that electrons move through the material. Too much strain, and
      the electrons tend to be reabsorbed by the material before they
      split water. <br>
      <br>
      Guerra says that the company has had to find a balance between
      absorbing more sunlight and allowing the electrons to move freely
      out of the material. Nanoptek has also developed cheaper ways to
      manufacture the nanostructured materials.<br>

      Titania is a semiconductor and photocatalyst that is also
      chemically inert. With its bandgap of 3.0, to activate the
      photocatalytic property of titania requires light of about 390 nm
      wavelength, which is in the ultra-violet, where sunlight is very
      low in intensity. A method and devices are disclosed wherein
      stress is induced and managed in a thin film of titania in order
      to shift and lower the bandgap energy into the longer wavelengths
      that are more abundant in sunlight. Applications of this
      stress-induced bandgap-shifted titania photocatalytic surface
      include photoelectrolysis for production of hydrogen gas from
      water, photovoltaics for production of electricity, and
      photocatalysis for detoxification and disinfection.<br>

            Created in Laboratory</b></big><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Take a gold sample the size of the head of a push pin, shoot a
      laser through it, and suddenly ore than 100 billion particles of
      anti-matter appear.<br>
      <br>
      The anti-matter, also known as positrons, shoots out of the target
      in a cone-shaped plasma "jet."<br>
      <br>
      This new ability to create a large number of positrons in a small
      laboratory opens the door to several fresh avenues of anti-matter
      research, including an understanding of the physics underlying
      various astrophysical phenomena such as black holes and gamma ray
      bursts.<br>
      <br>
      Anti-matter research also could reveal why more matter than
      anti-matter survived the Big Bang at the start of the universe.<br>
      <br>
      "We've detected far more anti-matter than anyone else has ever
      measured in a laser experiment," said Hui Chen, a Livermore
      researcher who led the experiment. "We've demonstrated the
      creation of a significant number of positrons using a short-pulse
      laser." Chen and her colleagues used a short, ultra-intense laser
      to irradiate a millimeter-thick gold target. "Previously, we
      concentrated on making positrons using paper-thin targets," said
      Scott Wilks, who designed and modeled the experiment using
      computer codes. "But recent simulations showed that
      millimeter-thick gold would produce far more positrons. We were
      very excited to see so many of them."<br>
      <br>
      In the experiment, the laser ionizes and accelerates electrons,
      which are driven right through the gold target. On their way, the
      electrons interact with the gold nuclei, which serve as a catalyst
      to create positrons. The electrons give off packets of pure
      energy, which decays into matter and anti-matter, following the
      predictions by Einstein's famous equation that relates matter and
      energy. By concentrating the energy in space and time, the laser
      produces positrons more rapidly and in greater density than ever
      before in the laboratory.<br>
      <br>
      "By creating this much anti-matter, we can study in more detail
      whether anti-matter really is just like matter, and perhaps gain
      more clues as to why the universe we see has more matter than
      anti-matter," said Peter Beiersdorfer, a lead Livermore physicist
      working with Chen.<br>
      <br>
      Particles of anti-matter are almost immediately annihilated by
      contact with normal matter, and converted to pure energy (gamma
      rays). There is considerable speculation as to why the observable
      universe is apparently almost entirely matter, whether other
      places are almost entirely anti-matter, and what might be possible
      if anti-matter could be harnessed. Normal matter and anti-matter
      are thought to have been in balance in the very early universe,
      but due to an "asymmetry" the anti-matter decayed or was
      annihilated, and today very little anti-matter is seen.<br>
      <br>
      Over the years, physicists have theorized about anti-matter, but
      it wasn't confirmed to exist experimentally until 1932.
      High-energy cosmic rays impacting Earth's atmosphere produce
      minute quantities of anti-matter in the resulting jets, and
      physicists have learned to produce modest amounts of anti-matter
      using traditional particle accelerators. Anti-matter similarly may
      be produced in regions like the center of the Milky Way and other
      galaxies, where very energetic celestial events occur. The
      presence of the resulting anti-matter is detectable by the gamma
      rays produced when positrons are destroyed when they come into
      contact with nearby matter.<br>
      <br>
      Laser production of anti-matter isn't entirely new either.
      Livermore researchers detected anti-matter about 10 years ago in
      experiments on the since-decommissioned Nova "petawatt" laser -
      about 100 particles. But with a better target and a more sensitive
      detector, this year's experiments directly detected more than 1
      million particles. From that sample, the scientists infer that
      around 100 billion positron particles were produced in total.<br>
      <br>
      Until they annihilate, positrons (anti-electrons) behave much like
      electrons (just with an opposite charge), and that's how Chen and
      her colleagues detected them. They took a normal electron detector
      (a spectrometer) and equipped it to detect particles with opposite
      polarity as well.<br>
      <br>
      "We've entered a new era," Beiersdorfer said. "Now, that we've
      looked for it, it's almost like it hit us right on the head. We
      envision a center for antimatter research, using lasers as cheaper
      anti-matter factories."<br>
      <br>
      Chen will present her work at the American Physical Society's
      Division of Plasma Physics meeting Nov. 17-21 at the Hyatt Regency
      Reunion in Dallas. S.C. Wilks, E. Liang, J. Myatt, K. Cone ,L.

      Physicists usually rely on electromagnetic magnetic fields to
      harness the power of plasma, the fourth state of matter, in fusion
      power experiments. But University of Missouri researchers have
      managed to create rings of plasma that can hold their shape
      without the use of outside electromagnetic fields—possibly paving
      the way for a new age of practical fusion power and leading to the
      creation of new energy storage devices.<br>
      <br>
      Traditional efforts to achieve nuclear fusion have relied upon
      multi-billion-dollar fusion reactors, called tokamaks, which
      harness powerful electromagnetic fields to contain the
      super-heated plasmas resulting from the fusion reactions. The
      ability to create plasma with self-confining electromagnetic
      fields in the open air could eliminate the need for external
      electromagnetic fields in future fusion experiments, and with it,
      much of the expense.<br>
      <br>
      The researchers created plasma rings about 15 centimeters in
      diameter that flew through the air across distances up to 60
      centimeters. The rings lasted just 10 milliseconds, but reached
      temperatures greater than the sun's fiery fusion core surface at
      around 6600 to 7700 degrees K (6327 to 7427 degrees C). Plasma
      physicists suspect that magnetic fields are still involved—but
      that the plasma rings create their own.<br>
      <br>
      "This plasma has a self-confining magnetic field," said Randy
      Curry, an engineer and physicist at the University of Missouri in
      Columbia. "If one can generate and contain it without large
      magnets involved, of course fusion energy would be an
      application." But the researchers' success in creating
      self-contained plasma rings came as a surprise. "We did not expect
      that," Curry says.<br>
      <br>
      The researchers had been working with exploding wires that
      vaporize when pulsed power is applied and release a cloud of
      plasma energy. They had previously only succeeded in making clouds
      of plasma that lasted less than a millisecond, Curry said.<br>

      This disclosure relates to methods and devices for generating
      electron dense air plasmas at atmospheric pressures. In
      particular, this disclosure relate to self-contained toroidal air
      plasmas. Methods and apparatuses have been developed for
      generating atmospheric toroidal air plasmas. The air plasmas are
      self-confining, can be projected, and do not require additional
      support equipment once formed.<br>
      <br>
      <b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0003] The present invention relates to a method and apparatus for
      generating self-sustaining air plasmas at atmospheric pressures.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0004] An air plasma is an electrically conductive state of matter
      composed of ions, electrons, radicals, and other neutral species
      formed at atmospheric pressure that exist in an independent state.
      Air plasmas may be used in a variety of applications, such as
      nonlethal weapons, fusion, plasma processing, propulsion,
      disinfection applications, and Shockwave mitigation.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] However, current plasma sources have been unable to
      generate an air plasma with an electron density sufficient to
      protect against the consequences of the overpressure caused by a
      Shockwave at atmospheric pressure. Furthermore, current plasma
      sources have been unable to generate self-containing or
      self-confining air plasmas that have lengthy lifetimes without the
      use of expensive and unwieldy support equipment or large magnets.
      Therefore, there remains a need for a versatile, scalable, and
      repeatable method and apparatus to generate air plasmas.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0006] The present invention relates to a method and an apparatus
      for generating self-confined and self-stabilized air plasmas at
      atmospheric pressures. In particular, the method and apparatus
      generate toroidal air plasmas (TAPs) at atmospheric pressure
      having an electron density sufficient for a number of
      applications. The method and apparatus may be configured to
      generate TAPs at a high repetition rate.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] The method includes generating a self-contained air plasma
      at an atmospheric pressure. The air plasma is generated in a first
      ignition region and restricted in radial expansion. The method
      also includes applying a high voltage pulse to the air plasma in a
      secondary ignition region to heat and accelerate the air plasma
      away from the second ignition region. Heating the air plasma
      causes the air plasma to expand and become self-contained.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] The apparatus for generating a self-contained air plasma at
      an atmospheric pressure includes a primary ignition region that
      includes a first shielding material defining a first cavity, that
      may be elongated or another configuration, to contain a plasma
      source. The apparatus also includes an ignition device to generate
      the air plasma from the plasma source and a secondary ignition
      region that includes a second shielding material defining a second
      region, that may be elongated or another configuration, wherein
      the second cavity is in fluid communication with the first cavity
      to receive the air plasma. In one embodiment, the second region is
      defined, at least in part, by a wire mesh that allows a current to
      be discharged through the air therein and form a plasma discharge.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] The apparatus includes a high voltage circuit that includes
      at least one capacitor and is in communication with a voltage
      source in order to apply a high voltage pulse to the air plasma.
      The high voltage pulse heats and accelerates the air plasma away
      from the apparatus to form the self-contained air plasma at the
      atmospheric pressure. In various other embodiments, the plasma
      source is at least one member of a group consisting of an
      exploding wire, an explosive, a puffed gas plasma, a hollow
      cathode plasma, a hypervelocity plasma source, a railgun, a
      microwave-driven plasma source, or other compact plasma source
      that can be directed into the second region. The plasma source may
      also be provided by a one or more laser-induced plasma channels.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] In another embodiment, a method for generating a self-
      contained air plasma at an atmospheric pressure includes applying
      a first high voltage pulse across a wire to explode the wire and
      generate the air plasma in a first ignition region located between
      an anode and a cathode. The method also includes restricting
      radial expansion of the air plasma, such that the air plasma
      travels parallel to a longitudinal axis of the wire to a second
      ignition region between the cathode and an accelerator electrode.
      A second high voltage pulse is applied across the cathode and the
      accelerator electrode to heat the air plasma, wherein heating the
      air plasma causes the air plasma to expand, accelerate, and form a
      toroidal structure. The method also includes discharging the
      self-contained toroidal air plasma from the second ignition region
      at the atmospheric pressure.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] The method further includes providing rigid electrically
      insulating materials between the anode and the cathode, as well as
      between the cathode and the accelerator electrode. The insulating
      materials define cavities, which may be elongated. The elongated
      cavity between the anode and the cathode receives the wire and
      restricts the radial expansion of the air plasma. The cavity
      between the cathode and the accelerator electrode allows the air
      plasma to expand. Both cavities may have generally cylindrical or
      spiral configurations. The cavities may have equal or different
      diameters and may be configured to increase or decrease the
      diameter of the toroidal plasma. In addition, the cavities may be
      configured to increase or decrease the velocity of the toroidal
      plasma.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] In another embodiment, a method for generating a self-
      contained air plasma at an atmospheric pressure includes
      generating the air plasma in a first ignition region, directing a
      velocity of expansion of the air plasma out of the first region,
      and imparting energy to the air plasma in a secondary ignition
      region, wherein the imparted energy causes the air plasma to
      expand, accelerate out of the second ignition region, and become
      self-contained. Alternately, the method may include restricting
      radial expansion of the air plasma.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] In various embodiments, the wire has a gauge in the range
      between 00 AWG and 80 AWG. In other embodiments, the first high
      voltage pulse is between 10kV and 50kV and has a duration between
      0.1 s and 200 ms, while the second high voltage pulse is between
      100V and 300V or up to many thousands of volts and has a duration
      between 1 ns and 1000 ms.<br>
      <br>
      [0014] In another embodiment, an apparatus for generating a self-
      contained air plasma at an atmospheric pressure includes a first
      shielding material positioned between an anode and a
      semi-permeable cathode in a primary ignition region. The first
      shielding material has a first longitudinal cavity to contain a
      conductive wire extended between and in communication with the
      anode and the cathode. The apparatus also includes a primary high
      voltage circuit with at least one voltage source and at least one
      capacitor. The primary high voltage circuit is in communication
      with the anode and the cathode to apply a first high voltage pulse
      across the wire causing it to explode and generate the air plasma.
      The first longitudinal cavity restricting radial expansion of the
      air plasma.<br>
      <br>
      [0015] The apparatus also includes a secondary ignition region
      defined by a second shielding material positioned between the
      cathode and a semi-permeable electrode. The second shielding
      material has a second longitudinal cavity extending between the
      cathode and the electrode wherein the second longitudinal cavity
      is in fluid communication with the first longitudinal cavity to
      receive the air plasma. The apparatus also includes a secondary
      high voltage circuit with at least one other capacitor that is in
      communication the voltage source. The secondary high voltage
      circuit further communicates with the cathode and the electrode to
      apply a second high voltage pulse across the gap between the
      cathode and the electrode, wherein the second high voltage pulse
      further heats and accelerates the air plasma as it traverses the
      electrode to form the self-contained air plasma at the atmospheric
      pressure.<br>
      <br>
      [0016] In various embodiments, the self-contained air plasma may
      be formed by a laser induced plasma and subsequently heated by a
      laser, a microwave pulse, or any means for imparting energy. The
      plasma formed in air is self-confined by electrostatic or
      electromagnetic fields and interactions. As such, the air plasma
      inherently has a long lifetime. The self-confined air plasma may
      have a lifetime on the order of milliseconds to multiple seconds
      or even minutes.<br>
      <br>
      [0017] The density of the plasma may be increased by using a
      pressurization system that may increase the pressure in the
      apparatus to a range between 1 ATM- 2000 ATM or higher. In
      addition, the air within and/or around the apparatus may be
      modified to optimize the size and electron density of the
      generated air plasmas. For example, the air within and/or around
      the apparatus may include one or more gas mixtures or gases seeded
      with nanoparticles or various chemical compounds.<br>
      <br>
      [0018] In various embodiments, the self-contained air plasmas have
      an electron density of at least 10&lt;10&gt;/cm&lt;3&gt; and may
      be as high as 10&lt;19&gt;/cm&lt;3&gt;. In addition, the geometry
      of the apparatus leads the air plasma to form a toroidal
      structure. <br>

      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b>[0026] The present invention relates to the generation of
      high- density air plasmas at atmospheric pressure that are
      sustainable for a sufficient duration and have an electron density
      sufficient to be used in a variety of applications. As used
      herein, an air plasma at atmospheric pressure refers to an air
      plasma having pressures substantially equal to the surrounding
      atmosphere. In addition, air plasmas at atmospheric pressure do
      not require specialized high- pressure or low-pressure vessels. In
      one aspect, the geometry of the air plasma generating apparatus
      gives rise to the shape and the self-containing nature of the air
      plasma. Once formed, the air plasmas are self-containing and do
      not require additional support equipment. For example, the air
      plasma generator may be configured to generate a toroidal air
      plasma (TAP). A TAP is an air plasma having a substantially
      toroidal shape.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] For example, the generated air plasmas may be used for
      shock wave mitigation, used as fusion sources for Tritium-Tritium
      or Deuterium- Tritium reactions or any other advanced fusion
      cycle, or plasma capacitors. In addition, the generated air
      plasmas may be used in nonlethal applications, including but not
      limited to electroshock weapons, such as a Taser. The air plasmas
      may also be used for a number of industrial applications,
      including but not limited to: plasma surface modification
      including semiconductor processing, polymer modification, directed
      energy applications, microwave generation, energy storage and
      generation, UV generation for semiconductor manufacturing, plasma
      chaff, surface disinfection, and microwave channeling at a
      distance. The air plasmas may also be used as an ignition source
      for turbines, combustion engines, and rocket engines. The
      generated plasmas may also be used in other applications, for
      example, the generated air plasmas may be precursors to ball
      lightning.<br>
      <br>
      <b>The Air Plasma Generator Apparatus</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0028] An embodiment of an air plasma generation apparatus 100
      that generates a toroidal air plasma (TAP) is shown in FIGS. 1 -3.
      The apparatus 100 includes an TAP generator 102 that is in
      electrical communication with a primary high-voltage circuit 104
      and a secondary circuit 106.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] The TAP generator 102 is capable of generating a TAP
      discharge, generally indicated as 130, that has a finite duration.
      According to one embodiment, the TAP generator 102 uses an
      exploding wire 108 to form the TAP discharge 130.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] As shown, the exploding wire 108 may be formed of a single
      strand of wire positioned within the TAP generator 102.
      Alternately, the exploding wire 108 may consist of a single stand
      of wire that is woven or looped back and forth within the TAP
      generator 102, such that multiple lengths of the wire may be
      exploded simultaneously. In various other embodiments, the
      exploding wire 108 may consist of multiple stands of distinct or
      looped wires.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] By way of example and not limitation, the exploding wire
      106 may be a 40-gauge copper wire; however, any suitable wire that
      heats and vaporizes in air may be used. In other examples, the
      exploding wire 108 may be any gauge of wire ranging from 00 AWG to
      80 AWG. In addition, the exploding wire 108 may be a solid wire, a
      plated wire, a wire that is doped with other materials, or a
      wire-clad in another material. The exploding wire 108 is suspended
      between an anode 1 10 and a cathode 1 12. To ignite the exploding
      wire 108, a high voltage current is applied across the anode 1 10
      and a cathode 1 12 and through the wire 108. In various
      embodiments, the high voltage current superheats at least a
      portion of the exploding wire 108, thereby causing it to expand
      explosively.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] The anode 1 10 and the cathode 1 12 define a primary
      ignition region 1 14 in which the exploding wire 108 is ignited.
      The primary ignition region 1 14 also includes a non-conductive
      primary shielding material 1 16 that fills a portion of the space
      between the anode 1 10 and the cathode 1 12. The primary shielding
      material 1 16 has a thickness equal to the spacing between the
      anode 1 10 and the cathode 1 12. In one example, the primary
      shielding material 1 16 may have a thickness between 5 cm and 20
      cm; however, other thickness and spacing distances may be used. In
      one embodiment, the primary shielding material 1 16 defines an
      primary elongated cavity 1 18 that receives the exploding wire
      108. The diameter of the elongated cavity is larger than the
      diameter of the exploding wire, such that the exploding wire 108
      does not contact the primary shielding material 1 16, thereby
      allowing the exploding wire 1 14 to ignite in air at atmospheric
      pressure. The primary elongated cavity 1 18 restricts the radial
      expansion of air, as indicated by 120, within the elongated cavity
      following the explosion from the exploding wire 108. Restriction
      the radial expansion 120 of the air, along with the momentum from
      the explosion directs the velocity of expanding air out of the
      primary ignition region 1 14.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] The composition of the exploding wire 108 may also
      contribute to the formation of the air plasma. By way of example
      and not limitation, the explosion of the wire 108 generates
      Shockwaves of electrons, ions, plasmas, UV waves and/or metal
      particles, as well as a number of other conditions, which may
      augment the formation of the TAP discharge 130. The exploding wire
      108 also generates a pressure pulse that imparts momentum to the
      gas molecules in a secondary ignition region 122 of the TAP
      generator 102. Similarly, the exploding wire 108 imparts energy
      and momentum to the TAP discharge 130 within the secondary
      ignition region 122.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] In one embodiment, the primary elongated cavity 1 18 is
      generally cylindrical. In another embodiment, the primary
      elongated cavity 1 18 has a spiral configuration. Similarly, other
      configurations of the primary elongated cavity 1 18 may be used;
      however, in all embodiments, the TAP discharge 130 from the
      exploding wire 108 is substantially restricted to axial
      acceleration along the axis of the central axis of the elongated
      cavity in order to generate boundary conditions that help form and
      shape the TAP discharge 130 in the secondary ignition region 122.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] The secondary ignition region 122 is defined, in part, by
      the cathode 1 12 and an accelerator electrode 124. In one
      embodiment, the cathode 1 12 and the accelerator electrode 124 are
      a semi-permeable materials, such as but not limited to a mesh or
      screen, such that the TAP discharge 130 may traverse the cathode
      and the accelerator electrode. By way of example and not
      limitation, the accelerator electrode 124 may be composed of
      stainless steel or any other semi-permeable conductive material.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] The secondary ignition region 122 includes a secondary
      shielding material 126. The secondary shielding material 126 is
      non-conductive and may have the same composition as the primary
      shielding material 1 16. Alternately, the secondary shielding
      material 126 may have a different composition than the primary
      shielding material 1 16.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] In one embodiment, secondary shielding material 126 has a
      thickness equal to the spacing between the cathode 1 12 and the
      accelerator electrode 124. In one example, the secondary shielding
      material 126 has a thickness ranging between approximately 2 mm
      and 2 cm depending upon the distance between the cathode 1 12 and
      the accelerator electrode 124; however other thickness and spacing
      distances may be used. The secondary shielding material 126 also
      defines a secondary cavity 128 that is axially aligned with the
      primary elongated cavity 1 18 of the primary shielding material 1
      16.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] In one embodiment, the diameter of the secondary cavity 128
      is greater than the diameter of the primary elongated cavity 1 18
      to allow the TAP discharge 130 to expand as it travels through or,
      alternately, is formed in and by the secondary ignition region
      122. In another embodiment, the diameter of the secondary cavity
      128 may be equal to or less than the diameter of the primary
      elongated cavity 1 18. Similarly, the length of the secondary
      cavity may be greater than, equal to, or less than the length of
      the first elongated cavity. In various other embodiments, the
      secondary ignition region 122 has multiple cavities that,
      optionally, may be aligned in parallel to one another and the
      primary elongated cavity 1 18.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] While a single primary ignition region 1 14 and a single
      secondary ignition region 122 are shown in FIGS. 1 -3, in other
      embodiments multiple ignition regions may be used to further
      amplify the effects of the TAP discharge 130. For example,
      multiple plasma sources may be ignited in multiple primary
      ignition regions and/or multiple secondary ignition regions may be
      used to amplify, accelerate, augment, and/or shape the TAP
      discharge 130.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] In various embodiments, the diameters of the primary and
      secondary cavities can be formed or otherwise configured to
      increase or decrease the diameter of the air plasma and to
      increase or decrease the velocity of the air plasma. The geometry
      of the self-contained air plasmas may also be enhanced through
      optimization of the air plasma generation apparatus 100 and the
      surrounding environment. For example, the TAP generator may be
      configured to generate stable plasmoids or spheres of plasma
      similar to ball lightning.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] The TAP generator 102 is electrically connected to a
      primary high voltage circuit 106 that is configured to deliver a
      high-voltage pulse to the anode 1 10 and the cathode 1 12. The TAP
      generator 102 is also electrically connected to a secondary
      circuit 106 configured to discharge energy through the plasma in
      the secondary ignition region 122.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] The primary high voltage circuit 106 includes one or more
      capacitor banks, one or more high voltage power sources, and one
      or more high- voltage switches, and suitable pulse generating
      circuitry to deliver a high-voltage pulse across the anode 1 10
      and the cathode 1 12. In one embodiment, the primary high voltage
      circuit 106 includes a capacitor bank energized to between
      approximately 2 kV and approximately 100 kV to deliver a high
      voltage pulse having a duration between about 10 ns and 200 ms
      pulse through the anode 1 10 and the cathode 1 12 to the exploding
      wire 108. In this embodiment, the anode 1 10 is solid or a
      semi-permeable conductor while the cathode 1 12 is semipermeable
      conductor.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] As shown in FIG. 4, a particular embodiment of the primary
      high voltage circuit 106 is an RLC circuit 400 that includes a
      number of resistors 402A-C, one or more inductors 404, and one or
      more capacitors or capacitor banks 406. The primary high voltage
      circuit 106 also includes as a power source 408, a three-plate
      pressurized air gap switch 410, a lead 412 connected to the anode
      1 10, another lead 414 connected to the cathode 1 12, and
      additional protection and safety circuitry, including but not
      limited to switches and diodes, generally indicated as 416. [0044]
      In one embodiment, the power source 408 is a direct current (DC)
      power source that supplies approximately 30kV to the primary high
      voltage circuit 106. The capacitor bank 406 has a capacitance of
      approximately 1 1 F to store and release approximately 4.4 kJ
      generate a 6 kA, 46 s current pulse (full- width half maximum)
      through the wire 108, causing the wire to explode. The inductor
      404 is typically an 1 1 .77 µ? air-core inductor. The inductor 404
      and a 5.5 O aqueous-electrolyte shaping resistor 402A are used to
      shape the current pulse.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] The circuit inductance and resistance are both variable
      parameters that affect the amount of current and energy delivered
      to and deposited into the wire 108. To determine the effects of
      circuit inductance on the current pulse delivered to the wire 108,
      the air core inductor 404, was replaced in various embodiments
      with other inductors having inductance values of 0.6 µ? and 27.5
      µ?. Similarly, in other embodiments, the aqueous-electrolyte
      resistor was replaced with resistors having resistances of
      approximately 20 O to approximately 300 ?t?O. Non
      aqueous-electrolyte resistors may also be used.<br>
      <br>
      [0046] When varying the inductance of the primary high-voltage
      circuit 104, a shaping resistor 402A with a resistance of
      approximately 5.2 O was used. Likewise, the inductor 404 had a
      resistance of approximately 1 1 .77 µ? when the resistance of
      resistor 402A was varied.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] The current pulse generated by the primary high-voltage
      circuit 104 with a typical 1 1 .77 µ? inductor 404 and a typical
      5.2 O shaping resistor 402A delivers approximately 6 kA with a
      pulse width of approximately 46.08 µe. It was observed that the
      peak and width of the current pulse varied with changes in
      inductance. For example, when the inductor 404 had an inductance
      of approximately 27.5 µ? the current pulse delivered to the wire
      104 had a peak current of approximately 5.48 kA and a pulse width
      of approximately 53.55 µe. While the current pulse generated when
      the inductor 404 had an inductance of 0.6 µ? results in higher
      current (approximately 6.88kA) delivered in a smaller pulse width
      (approximately 35.9 s). As expected in view of traditional circuit
      theory, it was observed that the current pulse decreases in
      amplitude yet spreads in pulse width as the inductance increases.
      Further, it was observed that varying the inductance of the
      primary high-voltage circuit 104 did not result in a significant
      change in the height or duration of the TAP discharge 130.<br>
      <br>
      Similarly, no significant effect was observed in the distance
      traveled data by the TAP discharge 130. As such, the inductance of
      the primary high-voltage circuit 104 may be varied according to
      the desired application of the air plasma generation apparatus 100
      without diminishing the generated TAPs.<br>
      <br>
      [0048] Conversely, it was determined that varying the resistance
      in the primary high-voltage circuit 104, did however, affect the
      generated TAPs. For example, the current pulse from a typical
      configuration of the primary high- voltage circuit, where the
      resistance of the shaping resistor 402A is<br>
      <br>
      approximately 5.2 O, is approximately 6 kA with a pulse width of
      approximately 46.08 s. The current pulse, when the resistor 402A
      has a resistance of approximately 20 O, however, reaches a peak of
      only about 2.02 kA with a pulse width of approximately 130.85 s.<br>
      <br>
      [0049] Further, by removing the typical aqueous-electrolyte
      resistor 402A from the circuit and directly connecting the
      inductor 404 to the anode 1 10, through lead 412, resulted in a
      stray resistance of approximately 300 ?t?O. In this configuration,
      the primary high-voltage circuit 104 is underdamped, rather than
      the typical overdamped configuration. As such, the resultant
      current oscillates about four times in approximately 288 s while
      reaching a peak of approximately 23.6 kA.<br>
      <br>
      [0050] Changing the resistance of the resistor 402A yields
      appreciable differences in the size and the duration of the TAP
      discharge 130. For example, when the resistor 402A has a
      resistance of approximately 20 O the TAP discharge 130 has a
      shorter duration and smaller diameter when compared to a shaping
      resistance of approximately 5.2 O. Further, when the resistor 402A
      is removed or otherwise reduced to yield a resistance of
      approximately 300 ?t?O, the TAP discharge 130 is approximately
      twice as large in diameter and has a longer duration when compared
      to TAP discharges with a 5.2 O resistor. In additionally, the TAP
      discharge 130 generated with a 300 ?t?O resistor for the shaping
      resistor 402A travels approximately twice as far as the TAP
      discharges generated using a 20 O resistor or a 5.2 O resistor for
      the shaping resistor. In this configuration, additional energy has
      been deposited into the TAP discharge 130 formed by the exploding
      wire 108. This results in an increase in the volume and duration
      of the TAP discharge 130 and may be caused, at least in part by
      the reduction in dampening of the primary high-voltage circuit
      104.<br>
      <br>
      [0051] Preferably, the secondary circuit 106 includes a capacitor
      bank charged to a voltage suitable for heating the TAP discharge
      130. For example, when the secondary high voltage circuit 106 is
      charged to between 100V and 300V, the TAP discharge 130 entering
      the secondary ignition region 122 completes a circuit between the
      cathode 1 12 and the accelerator electrode 124. The energy
      imparted by the secondary high voltage circuit 106 enhances the
      duration and velocity of the TAP discharge 130. In one embodiment,
      the secondary high voltage circuit 106 is connected to the same
      high voltage power source as the primary high voltage circuit 106.
      In another embodiment, the secondary high voltage circuit 106 is
      powered by another high voltage source. In yet another embodiment,
      the primary high voltage circuit 106 and the secondary high
      voltage circuit 106 may be incorporated into a single high voltage
      system.<br>
      <br>
      [0052] By way of example and not limitation, the secondary circuit
      106 may include a secondary 8.8 mF electrolytic capacitor bank 132
      that is charged to approximately 250 V to heat the plasma in the
      secondary ignition region 122. The post-explosion heating has been
      shown to enhance both the size and duration of the TAP discharge
      130.<br>
      <br>
      [0053] The additional heating provided by the secondary circuit
      106 also plays a role in forming the toroidal shape of the TAP
      discharge 130. For example, the elongated cavity 128 defined by
      the secondary shielding material 126 allows for the plasma
      generated by the explosion of the wire 104 to expand. During
      expansion, when the area between the cathode 1 12 and the
      accelerator anode 124 is filled with plasma, the secondary
      capacitor bank 132 discharges stored energy through the plasma. In
      one embodiment, a 400 A current drawn by the plasma from the
      secondary capacitor bank 132 has a pulse width of approximately 4
      ms. After the discharge from the secondary capacitor bank 132, the
      bulk of the TAP discharge 130 detaches from a portion 134 of the
      discharge that remains in the secondary ignition region 122 and
      exits from the TAP generator 102, as shown in FIG. 5. After the
      bulk of the TAP discharge 130 has separated from the remaining
      portion, the capacitor bank 132 may continue to discharge and
      energize the remaining plasma in the TAP generator 102.<br>
      <br>
      [0054] A cross sectional view of the evolution of the toroidal
      structure 500 of the TAP discharge 130 is shown in FIG. 5. For
      approximately the first millisecond after ignition, the discharge
      130 is still expanding from the secondary ignition region 122 and
      has a very homogeneous profile.<br>
      <br>
      Approximately 1 .5 ms after ignition, the toroidal shape begins to
      form. These two images illustrate the toroidal shape of the
      discharge at 6 ms and 7 ms after ignition. FIG. 5 also shows the
      remaining discharge 134 within the secondary ignition region 122.<br>
      <br>
      [0055] In one embodiment, the TAP discharge 130 can last up to 15
      ms while travelling approximately 30 cm from the TAP generator
      102. In other embodiments, the TAP discharge 130 may have a
      lifetime in the range of milliseconds to multiple seconds and
      multiple minutes. The toroidal structure 400 of the TAP discharge
      103 may expand to approximately 12 cm in diameter. In other
      embodiments, the toroidal structure 400 may expand to other
      diameters including those less than or greater than 12 cm. The
      electron density of the TAP is preferably at least
      10&lt;10&gt;/cm&lt;3&gt; and may be as high as
      10&lt;19&gt;/cm&lt;3&gt;. In various embodiments, the electron
      density is determined to be approximately
      10&lt;14&gt;-10&lt;15&gt;/cm&lt;3&gt; based upon the measured
      current passing through the plasma while it is in the secondary
      ignition region 122.<br>
      <br>
      [0056] The density of the plasma may be increased by using a
      pressurization system (not shown) that may increase the pressure
      in the apparatus to a range between 1 ATM- 2000 ATM or higher. In
      addition, the air within and/or around the apparatus may be
      modified to optimize the size and electron density of the
      generated air plasmas. For example, the air within and/or around
      the apparatus may include one or more gas mixtures or gases seeded
      with nanoparticles or various chemical compounds.<br>
      <br>
      [0057] In various embodiments, the radial expansion 120 of the
      shock wave and heat generated by the explosion of the wire 108 is
      confined within the primary and secondary cavities 1 18 and 128,
      respectively. The discharge from the exploding wire 108 is thus
      dissipated, predominantly, through axial expansion along the axis
      of the primary elongated cavity 1 18 and the secondary cavity 128.
      This imparts hydrodynamic effects upon the TAP discharge 130 and
      therefore, the geometry of the TAP generator 102 lends itself to
      the self-containing characteristics of the TAP discharge 130.<br>
      <br>
      [0058] The combined effects of the initial axial expansion from
      the exploding wire 108 and the secondary excitation in the
      secondary ignition region 122 result in the formation of the
      toroidal structure 400. In various other embodiments, the
      secondary ignition region 122 may have any geometry that can
      transfer energy into the TAP discharge 130. In these embodiments,
      the temperature and subsequent absorption and emission of light by
      the TAP discharge 130 can be tailored to specific requirements
      based upon the geometry of the secondary ignition region 122. The
      duration and amount of energy delivered to the plasma in the
      secondary ignition region 122 can be optimized to generate
      characteristics of the TAP discharge 130 that are required for the
      desired application. For example, by increasing the energy
      imparted to the TAP discharge in the secondary ignition region
      122, the lifetime of the TAP discharge may be extended from
      milliseconds to minutes thereby allowing the long-range projection
      of the plasma.<br>
      <br>
      [0059] Although the TAP generator 102 has been described using the
      exploding wire 108 as the initial plasma source, other plasma
      sources may be used. By way of example and not limitation, other
      plasma sources include explosives, puffed gas plasmas, hollow
      cathode plasmas, microwave driven sources, high power laser
      arrays, railguns, hypervelocity plasma accelerators, and any other
      plasma source that has a high repetition rate to generate ionized
      particles. In these embodiments, the plasma source is activated by
      a suitable activation device corresponding to the plasma course.
      For example, an activation device for an explosive is a detonator,
      while an activation device for a microwave driven source is a
      microwave generator.<br>
      <br>
      [0060] In another example, one or more lasers is used to form or
      further heat the TAP discharge 130. For example, a laser may be
      used to form a laser-induced air plasma in the primary ignition
      region 1 14. Alternately, a laser may be used to heat a plasma
      discharge within the secondary ignition region 122.<br>
      <br>
      [0061] In various embodiments, the air plasma generation apparatus
      100 is configured for single or multi-shot operation. As such, the
      air plasma generation apparatus 100 may generate a single or
      multiple self- contained air plasmas at a high rate of repetition.<br>
      <br>
      <b>The Toroidal Air Plasma</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0062] The TAP discharge 130 has a very homogenous profile
      immediately after the ignition of the exploding wire 108 as it
      expands from the first primary elongated cavity 1 18. In one
      embodiment, the TAP discharge 130 begins to take on the toroidal
      structure 400 approximately 1 .5 ms after ignition. The toroidal
      structure 400 of the TAP discharge 200 is shown at approximately 6
      ms and approximately 7 ms after ignition in FIGS. 5A and 5B,
      respectively.<br>
      <br>
      FIGS. 6A and 6B also show the secondary ignition 600 of the TAP
      discharge 130 within the secondary ignition region 122. When the
      TAP discharge 130 exits the TAP generator 102, the discharge has a
      circulating current or field reversal that generates a
      self-magnetic field as well as a rotating plasma region on the
      minor radius of the toroid structure 400. The self-magnetic field
      confines the TAP discharge 130 and significantly increases the
      lifetime of the TAP discharge to effectively produce a
      self-sustaining TAP discharge by reducing interactions that may
      recombine molecules of the air plasma with atmospheric gas
      molecules.<br>
      <br>
      [0063] In various embodiments, the TAP discharge can be sustained
      for approximately 2-30 ms and may travel approximately 10-40 cm
      away from the TAP generator 102 at up to 200 m/s. The toroidal
      shape 500 may expand up to approximately 12 cm in diameter. The
      electron density of the TAP discharge 130 is approximately
      10&lt;14&gt;-10&lt;15&gt;/cm&lt;3&gt; as determined by the
      measured current passing through the TAP discharge 130 during the
      secondary heating of the discharge in the secondary ignition
      region 122. In various other embodiments, the TAP discharge 130 is
      scalable to higher energies, densities and can be used for a
      number of advanced applications.<br>
      <br>
      [0064] For example, 1 kilojoule to 1 gigajoule or higher of energy
      may be imparted to the TAP discharge 130 in the secondary ignition
      region 122. Increasing the energy will increase the lifetime of
      the TAP discharge 130 from an order of milliseconds to minutes
      allowing for the long-range projection of the TAP discharge.<br>
      <br>
      [0065] FIG. 7 is a flowchart illustrating one embodiment of a
      method 700 for generating a TAP discharge 130. At step 702, a
      first high voltage pulse is applied across the anode 1 10, the
      cathode 1 12, and the exploding wire 108 in the primary ignition
      region 1 14. The first high voltage causes the wire to explode
      thereby producing the TAP discharge 130. At step 704, the radial
      expansion of the AP discharge is restricted such that the TAP
      discharge travels along the longitudinal axis of the wire to a
      second ignition region defined by the cathode 1 12 and the
      accelerator electrode 124. [0066] In the second ignition region
      122, a second high voltage pulse is applied across the cathode 1
      12 and the accelerator electrode 124 to further heat and expand
      the TAP discharge 130, at step 706. Within the secondary ignition
      region 122, the TAP discharge becomes self-sustaining and takes on
      the toroid structure 200. At step 708, the self-contained TAP
      discharge is discharged from the second ignition region 122,
      wherein it may be used to mitigate the effects of a shock wave or
      another propagating wave.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example Method for Generating a Toroidal Air Plasma</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0067] By way of example and not limitation, an exemplary method
      for generating a TAP discharge, such as the discharge 130 is
      provided. The primary high voltage circuit 104 of the air plasma
      generation apparatus 100 included an 1 1 F capacitor bank
      energized to approximately 30kV to deliver a 4 kA pulse for a
      duration of approximately 200 s pulse through two strands of 40
      AWG silver-plated copper wire 108 within the TAP generator 102.
      The anode 1 10 connected to the wire 108 was a copper screen while
      the cathode 1 12 was a stainless steel screen. The primary
      shielding material 1 16 was a polycarbonate material having a
      thickness of approximately 10 cm and the elongated cavity 1 18 had
      a diameter of approximately 1 .25 cm.<br>
      <br>
      [0068] The secondary circuit 106 used an 8.8 mF electrolytic
      capacitor bank 132 charged to 250V to heat the TAP discharge 130.
      The secondary primary shielding material 126 was plastic
      approximately 7 mm thick and defined another elongated cavity 128
      with a diameter of approximately 3 cm. The secondary circuit 106
      discharged approximately 400A into the TAP discharge 130 over
      approximately 4 ms. The TAP discharge 130 exiting the TAP
      generator 102 has an electron density of approximately
      10&lt;16&gt;-10&lt;17&gt;/cm&lt;3&gt; as determined by the
      measured current that passed through the discharge during the
      secondary heating. <br>

            Warming</b></big><br>
        <br>
        <div align="left">A method is described for reducing atmospheric
          or global warming resulting from the presence of heat-trapping
          gases in the atmosphere, i.e., from the greenhouse effect.
          Such gases are relatively transparent to sunshine, but absorb
          strongly the long-wavelength infrared radiation released by
          the earth. The method incudes the step of seeding the layer of
          heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere with particles of
          materials characterized by wavelength-dependent emissivity.
          Such materials include Welsbach materials and the oxides of
          metals which have high emissivity (and thus low
          reflectivities) in the visible and 8-12 micron infrared
          wavelength regions.<br>

      <div align="center"><big><b>A British company has invented a
            boiler that generates electricity as well as heat</b></big><br>
        <br>
        <b>Stefano Pozzebon</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      A British company has launched an innovative boiler that could
      totally change the way people pay for their energy and heat their
      homes.<br>
      <br>
      The Flow boiler provides both hot water and heat for the flats and
      apartments it is installed in but, on top of that, it also
      produces electric energy that can power household appliances.<br>
      <br>
      It aims at covering several energy needs with one single energy
      source, potentially allowing customers to generate their own power
      inside their homes. The more people will be able to generate
      electricity on their own, the less demand there will be on the
      national grid.<br>
      <br>
      Flow believes that its boiler can reduce a household's emissions
      by 20%.<br>
      <br>
      By switching electricity sources from an external service to the
      Flow boiler, a family can save up to £80 a month, according to the
      developers.<br>
      <br>
      Here is how it works: In a traditional boiler, gas is burned to
      heat water, which then passes through the home's pipes and
      radiators.<br>
      <br>
      The Flow boiler instead uses the gas to heat a high-pressure
      liquid coolant that is sealed inside the system. The vapour
      created then moves through a dynamo called a "scroll expander,"
      which spins and acts as a mini electric generator.<br>
      <br>
      The hot vapor then moves through a heat exchanger, heating up the
      hot water for the house. The vapor returns to the boiler as the
      hot water is pumped around the house.<br>
      <br>
      The Flow is using gas from the national grid to do two jobs
      (create heat and drive a turbine) where a normal boiler does one,
      in other words.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Flow Energy</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The product was 10 years in development. Flow CEO Tony Stiff is
      looking forward to seeing how it performs in the market. "I think
      it is a game-changer for a family," he said to Business Insider. <br>
      <br>
      Stiff said that the company has stocked up interests for 15,000
      boilers prior to launch, but the company has the capacity to
      produce 200,000 units per year. If that is the case, the company
      will be able to hire 700 people at its headquarters in Ipswich,
      the Ipswich Star reports.<br>
      <br>
      The boilers are also produced in the UK: in Livingston, Scotland,
      by the American manufacturer Jabil.<br>

      Flow is a reliable and really efficient boiler with a bit of magic
      inside.<br>
      <br>
      This is the world's first affordable electricity-generating
      boiler. It uses patented technology to generate electricity as
      it's heating your home. No other company anywhere else in the
      world has a boiler like this. <br>

      </div>
      <b><br>
      </b><b>What is Hemp Adobe?</b><br>
      <br>
      Hemp Adobe is a Proprietary Mix of&nbsp; - Hemp Adobe Brick Home
      Interior View- Family Room of HouseRefractories, Mineral Dust,
      Natural Fibers, Sand and Water.<br>
      <br>
      The advantage to using this mix is there is no toxic off-gas from
      casting the materials into the finished product.&nbsp; Its primary
      function is to gather, or sequester carbon dioxide from the
      environment as a part of the curing process and then forming to a
      petrified state.<br>
      <br>
      Hemp Adobe can be engineered to any volume of space, and into any
      shape desired. Hemp Adobe is 60% of the weight of conventional
      concrete. The strength of this material eliminates the need for
      rebar reinforcement.<br>
      <br>
      Basalt&nbsp; is another of Hemp Adobe’s base materials of choices,
      as spalling or corrosion does not occur, because of the inclusion
      of basalt.<br>
      <br>
      The Material Mix is highly efficient, a natural insulator, and
      allows for thermal exchange.<br>
      <br>
      Hemp is a Natural Biocide.<br>
      <br>
      Mold growth, and insects are are negated due to hemp’s innate
      qualities as it functions as a natural biocide.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Applications</b><br>
      <br>
      The application of Hemp Adobe is Unlimited. We are just&nbsp;
      realizing it amazing possibilities.<br>
      <br>
      We do envision applications in; home construction, large
      industrial structures, sub-terrain, roads, transportation
      projects, bridges and spans.<br>
      <br>
      We are also seeing hemp adobe applications in; gardens, roofing
      and panel construction.<br>
      <br>
      The beauty of this material is that it can assume any shape we
      wish.<br>

      <br>
      Correlated magnetics is a fundamental breakthrough in magnetics.
      By combining many magnetic fields, CMR’s patented Polymagnet
      technology transforms ordinary magnets into precision-tailored
      magnetic systems that produce complex functions not possible with
      conventional magnets. Magnetic functions are created with the
      world’s first magnetic printer, the CMR MagPrinter. The MagPrinter
      creates patterns of small magnetic regions called maxels on
      rare-earth, ferrite or flexible magnetic materials. Each
      Polymagnet pattern creates a unique function.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Polymagnet means many magnets</b><br>
      <br>
      Polymagnets contain many smaller magnetic elements that can
      produce superior attachment forces, safer magnets, precision
      alignment, shear and torque stiffness, and complex,
      multi-level/multi-force functions never before achieved with
      traditional bulk magnets.<br>
      <br>
      Polymagnet technology enables unprecedented control over magnet
      interaction by applying the principles of signal processing theory
      and correlation methods to a pattern of magnetic elements on the
      magnet surface. Each Polymagnet comprises a number of pixel-like
      elements called maxels. The arrangement or pattern of these maxels
      creates a unique magnetic circuit that defines the function of the
      Polymagnet device and its interaction with other magnets and
      ferrous metals.<br>
      <br>
      The basic principle behind the interaction of Polymagnets is
      correlation, in which magnetic fields add to or subtract from the
      aggregate forces depending on the orientation of the maxels.
      Patterns can vary according to the number, location, size, shape
      and amplitude of the maxels that constitute the Polymagnet... the
      possible combinations reach toward infinity...<br>
      <br>
      Among the many advantages of Polymagnets are…<br>
      <br>
      Stronger forces : By concentrating magnetic flux at the surface of
      the magnet, more magnetic force is created ... can be tuned to
      thickness of metal... down to thousandths of an inch.<br>
      <br>
      Safer magnets : reduces stray magnetic fields that can
      accidentally attract nearby metal or other magnets. Concentrating
      the available magnetic flux into a prescribed near-surface region
      ... to achieve incredible attach force while reducing the risk of
      unintended attraction and acceleration of metal objects or other
      magnets... can even protect volatile magnetic storage devices from
      damaging stray fields.<br>
      <br>
      Precision alignment : By varying the number of magnetic elements,
      materials, and maxel pattern ... the positioning can be “assisted”
      by the magnetic field ... to attach at one position only, or at
      multiple positions, at prescribed rotation angles, lateral
      translation, or other spatial arrangement.<br>
      <br>
      Shear stiffness : Magnetic shear forces are traditionally weak
      relative to the attract and repel forces developed normal to a
      magnet surface... Polymagnets can ... significantly increase the
      shear forces... by improving the magnetic shear densities ... and
      the attach force between a magnet and a metal target surface. This
      Polymagnet advantage is even more pronounced as the magnet and/or
      metal surface thickness decreases. Better magnetic attach
      performance with less material, lower weight, smaller volume, and
      reduced costs.<br>
      <br>
      Torque transfer : Magnetic gears and couplings offer decided
      advantages over mechanical couplings because they eliminate wear
      and suppress vibration... Polymagnet technology provides superior
      torque density, and can be tuned for specific applications by
      varying the spatial frequency (transition from north polarity to
      south polarity) of the maxel regions.<br>
      <br>
      Multi-level magnetic systems : Polymagnet technology confers to
      the magnet designer precise control over magnetic fields in terms
      of reach, flux density, and three-dimensional shape of the field.
      In addition, the polarity mix for a given pattern can produce
      local attract or repel forces. These fields and forces can be
      combined to produce magnets that attract at a distance and repel
      in close proximity. Conversely, a multi-level design approach can
      produce a Polymagnet system where the components repel each other
      at a distance and attract each other in close proximity. The
      resulting behavior becomes a useful design functionality for
      attachment devices, motion actuators, and much more.<br>
      <br>
      Complex magnetic fields : Pixel-like magnetic elements (maxels)
      can be aggregated to form very intricate magnetic fields...
      enabling a nearly limitless set of unique magnetic field
      designs...<br>

      <br>
      An often overlooked aspect of water is its unique ability to take
      on and hold a charge of energy by forming crystals in its atomic
      substructure,<br>
      reflecting the stored energy.&nbsp; Like a rose reflects color to
      the eye, the water crystals reflect color and the energy that has
      been loaded into their network. Many methods have been tried to
      achieve the perfect water crystal for the body to use and to
      recognize as natural and beneficial to its restoration and
      cleansing processes. Unfortunately, we use prepared water stored
      in bottles, carried through pipes, and treated for human
      consumption by various electrically charged antibacterial
      processes.<br>
      <br>
      Using these methods have destroyed the naturally occurring life
      force in clean, fresh, well water and clear aquifer water. Those
      waters all contain a natural "Earth charge" that can actually be
      measured when first taken from their source. All the processing
      eliminates the very reason we drink water - which is for the life
      forces released in&nbsp; the body when it breaks water down into
      the hydrogen and oxygen used in maintaining life.<br>
      <br>
      The problem begins when we bring water from wells and treat it
      with various chemicals and electricity. This was graphically shown
      in photographs presented at the International Water Conference
      held in Pasadena in May 2001.&nbsp; Dr. Masaru Emoto showed his
      research involved freezing water to subzero temperatures and then
      photographing the crystals that are formed to show the result of
      their exposure to stimuli. The pictures reveal that the water
      structure is severely damaged by electrical processing. Not even
      micro-clustering or any other process will recreate water's
      original cold vortex in the Earth, a "perfect crystal of stored
      energy." According to many modern researchers.<br>
      <br>
      In our presentation at the conference, Tom's research showed a new
      type of water crystal, created using a previously unknown method
      of interacting with the core atoms of hydrogen and elements of
      natural primal energy.<br>
      <br>
      The result is an absolutely perfectly structured, rotating water
      crystal, created from the ultra pure distilled water we start
      with. We go into the interior of the water crystal to reorganize
      the energy structure and reprogram it to emit high levels of this
      so called "living energy." This natural, organic process causes
      the crystal&nbsp; to spin rapidly and give off strong
      electromagnetic pulses (natural earth pulses) that are easily felt
      by most people. These are the vital lost electrical signals the
      body uses to guide the water through the aquaporins.<br>
      <br>
      This activity was first videotaped by the internationally known
      molecular water-energy researcher, Dr.Randy Ziesenis, in his lab
      in Oklahoma using a 20,000-power microscope. (Dr. Zeiseneis
      does&nbsp; research with Dr. Bill Tiller, Professor Emetrius,
      Stanford University, on water.) The study revealed high-speed
      spinning vortexes in our water, "releasing balls of pure light,
      disseminating their energy into whatever they touch."<br>
      <br>
      Starchamber first gave a paper on these phenomena at the
      International Forum on New Sciences Conference at Colorado State
      University in 1991, where we discussed the process of restoring
      the human system using this discovery. Our water adds this
      tremendous force to whatever it is placed into or on.<br>
      <br>
      Our water is made using natural earth currents and the unified
      field as described by Einstein and by our new research into Nikola
      Tesla's studies on free energy.&nbsp; The charging tool is an
      organic device designed to collect the natural energies around us.
      The tool "creates cold vortical amplification and enhancement"
      into the water to create the spinning effect we see in the
      photos...&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      Pure distilled water is used as a carrier of our charging process.
      The water is sealed in the holding tank and the charging tool is
      placed outside around the tank.&nbsp; After a prescribed time, the
      water inside has been permanently charged and restructured with
      the naturally enhanced energy, by a process known as "biomagnetic
      entrainment".<br>
      <br>
      The charging device consists of hundreds of organic sands and
      metallic elements, with the magnetic ability to transfer their
      natural organic electric energy to the water inside the holding
      tanks.<br>
      <br>
      This moving natural Earth energy field causes the water molecules
      to restructure in a cold vortical form, and rotate at high speed,
      as seen in the actual laboratory video shot by Dr. Randy
      Zeiseneis, world renowned water researcher.&nbsp; Dr. Zeiseneis
      visually confirmed VEW as free high speed cold vortical rotating
      energetic molecules, same as described by Dr. Gerald Pollack Ph.D.
      Director of University of Washington's research, on water's
      ability to hold charges and the ability to properly transfer it to
      the cells, if structured as a vortex.<br>

      <br>
      A water charging machine wherein the water being treated is moved
      downwardly through a vertically extending outer vortex and then
      moved in an upwardly extending inner vortex within the outer
      vortex. Oxygen may be introduced into the stream of water either
      upstream of the outer vortex or at the point of reversal of the
      water between the outer vortex and the inner vortex, or both, to
      provide a long shelf life incorporation of the gaseous oxygen in
      the water. The water and oxygen may also be exposed to a negative
      or positive magnetic field and a piezoelectric field to provide a
      substantial Zeta potential.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      It is now generally recognized that most people suffer from a lack
      of adequate oxygen for optimal body functions. For example, it is
      generally recognized that the oxygen level in the air is much
      below what it was many years ago. Many efforts have been made to
      provide a supplemental supply of oxygen. The most obvious way is
      to provide a mask connected to a supply of gaseous oxygen;
      however, such use is inconvenient and can be dangerous if not
      properly monitored.<br>
      <br>
      Other efforts have included incorporation of additional oxygen in
      water based products, such as drinking water. Heretofore, however,
      such attempts have not been adequate for a variety of reasons,
      such as the inability of presently known techniques for
      incorporating gaseous oxygen in water in such a manner that the
      oxygen will be retained in the water over extended periods of
      time, particularly after the container for the water is opened to
      atmospheric pressure.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      In accordance with the present invention, a stream of water in
      which oxygen is to be incorporated is first directed downwardly in
      an outer vortex, and then directed upwardly through an inner
      vortex within the outer vortex. The oxygen could be incorporated
      into the stream of water by being introduced into the stream
      before the stream is moved through the first outer vortex, as well
      as being introduced at the point of reversal of the stream from
      the outer vortex to the inner vortex, or both.<br>
      <br>
      In a preferred embodiment, the gaseous oxygen introduced into the
      stream prior to the stream entering the first outer vortex is
      introduced in smaller bubbles than is the gaseous oxygen
      introduced into the stream at the point of reversal between the
      outer and the inner vortexes. Also, in the preferred embodiment,
      the water is moved in each vortex in a clockwise direction looking
      in the direction of movement of the stream...<br>

      <br>
      Enhances water's natural ability to hydrate and nourish cells and
      tissues, providing superior health and productivity for plants,
      animals and people while reducing the amount of water needed.<br>
      <br>
      Farmers and ranchers have long known of the positive effects of
      rainwater on their fields. The Rainmaker™ mimics one of nature’s
      greatest miracles of natural cleansing and regeneration. We have
      created the same revitalizing effect the earth's atmosphere has on
      rainwater. When it rains, some of the molecules of water (H2O) are
      changed into natural peroxide (H2O2), hydronium (H3O) and ozone
      (O3). Peroxide is water with an extra oxygen atom attached to it.
      Hydronium is water that has an extra hydrogen atom attached to it
      and ozone is an oxygen molecule with an extra oxygen atom attached
      to it.<br>
      <br>
      Although rarely discussed in the general or scientific literature,
      it is the presence of "hydrogen," that is the real determinant of
      cellular pH, also known as the acid/alkaline balance, a vital
      component in the health of all plants, animals and people
      everywhere on the earth. In addition, the extra supply of hydrogen
      ions attract vital, life-restoring and life-sustaining energy and
      information from the natural environment, with the bulk water
      (H2O) acting, in effect, like a "carrier wave."<br>
      <br>
      Ozone is one of nature's greatest cleansers and sanitizers that
      de-activates bacteria and viruses 3125 times faster and 50% more
      efficiently than chlorine. This allows for the control of common
      bacteria like E. coli, as well as fecal coliforms, viruses, fungi,
      mold, mildew and cysts. Unlike chlorine, however, which produces
      trihalomethane (a toxic chemical by-product), ozone is not
      carcinogenic. In fact, it is extremely beneficial.<br>
      <br>
      Water is the very substance of life and oxygen is its breath. As
      stated above, oxygen-rich, life-giving rainwater is loaded with
      natural ozone and peroxide that are both found in the chlorophyll
      of plant greens you eat. Water in this form oxygenates and
      revitalizes your plants as well as your body.<br>
      <br>
      Human impact on the soil has increased across the globe. In the
      course of trying to provide a favorable environment for life,
      people everywhere have manipulated nature resulting instead in
      serious damage to the entire ecosystem. The Rainmaker™ helps to
      reverse these negative effects by providing more available
      life-enhancing water and nutrients for your plants which results
      in far higher nutrient density and much greater crop yields.<br>

      A new app that claims to be able to improve people's eyesight by
      'training' them with a series of exercises has become a hit.<br>
      <br>
      Called GlassesOff, it uses a series of patterns to create 15
      minutes exercises for users.<br>
      <br>
      If done three times a week, its makers say it could mean they no
      longer need reading glasses after three months.<br>
      <br>
      The app uses a series of games, puzzles and tests to improve a
      user's eyesight - if they can play for 15 minutes three times a
      week for three months.<br>

      The app uses a series of games, puzzles and tests to improve a
      user's eyesight - if they can play for 15 minutes three times a
      week for three months.<br>
      <br>
      <b>HOW IT WORKS</b><br>
      <br>
      GlassesOff uses a completely different approach that is
      exclusively aimed at teaching the visual system of the brain to
      better use its potential.<br>
      <br>
      This allows the brain to compensate for blurred information
      captured by the eyes as we age.<br>
      <br>
      The foundation for this technology is provided by the brain's
      ability to adapt, the app makers say.<br>
      <br>
      The app uses patterns designed to strengthen&nbsp; connections
      within circuits relevant to a task, such as recognizing letters
      when reading.<br>
      <br>
      'Traditionally, near distance reading improvement solutions were
      limited to optical corrections such as glasses, contact lenses and
      refractive surgery,' said said Nimrod Madar, CEO of GlassesOff.<br>
      <br>
      'However, human vision performance is in fact limited by two
      factors: the quality of an image captured by the eye and the image
      processing capability of the brain as it interprets such images.<br>
      <br>
      'Our solution is designed to improve reading by enhancing the
      image processing function of the visual cortex, demonstrating the
      amazing potential of the human brain. <br>
      <br>
      The app uses patterns as well as games to train the user's eyes<br>
      <br>
      'We created this app because we wanted to empower people who
      experienced natural age-related changes in reading ability to take
      control of their vision and improve their quality of life.<br>
      <br>
      'Our personalized app constantly adapts according to users’
      progress, with the ultimate goal of freeing them from dependency
      on magnifying devices such as reading glasses.”<br>
      <br>
      The GlassesOff app is free to download from the App Store and
      offer users access to a vision evaluation and the first segment of
      the GlassesOff program.<br>
      <br>
      After Using the GlassesOff app for approximately two weeks, users
      will be given the option to subscribe to the full version, which
      includes additional advanced segments, for $59.99.<br>
      <br>
      However, during the launch, subscriptions will be offered at a
      special price of just $9.99.<br>
      <br>
      <b>App claims exercise will improve eyesight</b><br>
      <br>
      The app gives users regular tests to check their progress, giving
      them a 'brain speed' ranking as they improve<br>
      <br>
      The researchers have also published several studies backing up the
      app's effectiveness.<br>
      <br>
      In a study carried out at the University of California at Berkeley
      and published in Nature Scientific Reports, all subjects who
      completed the GlassesOff program were able to read standard
      newspaper font size without the use of reading glasses, while
      improving their 'Eye Age' by an average of 8.6 years.<br>
      <br>
      A second study looks at the correlation between the fovea, which
      is part of the retina, and crowding, processing speed and vision
      sharpness.<br>
      <br>
      The findings demonstrate that the GlassesOff technology may be
      applicable to improved performance of daily tasks, such as sports,
      reading, driving, and more.<br>
      <br>
      'This study results reaffirm our product’s ability to help reading
      by improving visual processing speed.<br>
      <br>
      'The results are encouraging and relevant for our planned launch
      of a series of pipeline products for mass market segments,
      including those designed to improve visual functions in sports and
      reading speed,' said Madar.<br>

      <br>
      Human vision is limited by two main factors:<br>
      <br>
      The quality of an image captured by the eyes.<br>
      <br>
      The image processing capabilities of the brain as it interprets an
      image captured by the eyes.<br>
      <br>
      GlassesOff scientists have developed a proprietary method for
      improving near vision sharpness, by improving the image processing
      function in the visual cortex of the brain.<br>
      <br>
      eople can impact their vision by increasing the quality of images
      captured by their eye (e.g., wearing glasses, going through
      corrective eye surgery), or by enhancing their brain’s image
      processing abilities.<br>
      <br>
      At some point, every person will suffer from the inevitable
      natural deterioration in near distance reading capabilities. This
      deficiency has typically been addressed by traditional products
      for improvement of reading capabilities, mainly magnification
      devices such as reading glasses or contact lenses that support
      reading.<br>
      <br>
      GlassesOff scientists have developed a patented method for
      boosting the image processing function in the visual cortex of the
      brain, thereby improving a person’s near vision sharpness and
      reading capabilities.<br>
      Scientifically Proven Solution<br>
      <br>
      Our technology is based on extensive scientific research and
      achievements that have been published in the leading scientific
      publications, such as Nature, Science, PNAS, Vision Research,
      Scientific Reports and others.<br>
      <br>
      During the last two decades, scientists have demonstrated that
      contrast-driven neural responses are robustly affected by lateral
      propagations between neurons in the visual cortex. A positive
      effect of this interaction is called “collinear facilitation”,
      which amplifies weak and slow responses and their underlying
      mechanism of neuronal excitations. This function strengthens
      selective synapses to elevate weak stimuli above the noise, and is
      the foundation of GlassesOff technology.<br>
      <br>
      Weaker and slower neuronal responses in the visual cortex, either
      as a consequence of blurred input from the eyes or abnormal
      development, result in degraded basic visual functions both in the
      spatial domain, e.g. contrast sensitivity, and the temporal
      domain, e.g. processing speed. These changes eventually affect
      high-level visual tasks, such as letter identification. GlassesOff
      scientists have shown that using neuronal plasticity retained in
      the adult brain, it is possible to increase collinear facilitation
      to compensate for spatial and temporal deficiencies.<br>

      The effectiveness of the GlassesOff product was examined in a
      recent study conducted at the University of California at Berkeley
      and published in Nature’s Scientific Reports. This study clearly
      demonstrated the significant benefit of the GlassesOff training
      program for reading abilities and eye age. Moreover, cutting-edge
      optometric equipment allowed the scientists to unequivocally
      determine that the actual source of the observed benefits is
      solely in the brain and not in the optics of the eyes.<br>

      <br>
      Perceptual training was applied to an adult visual system with
      abnormal development of the primary visual cortex of the brain
      leading to amblyopia (“lazy eye”). Training yielded significant
      benefits that transfer to higher visual tasks, resulting in a
      two-fold improvement in contrast sensitivity and in
      letter-recognition tasks in patients between 9 and 55 years old.
      This is the first evidence for a remarkable vision improvement
      following perceptual learning in a condition previously
      acknowledged as untreatable in adults.<br>

      <br>
      Generalization, or transfer, of gains acquired on a trained task
      to other functions is crucial for both understanding the neural
      mechanisms and the practical values of the training. This study
      describes a perceptual learning method applied to amblyopia (“lazy
      eye”), myopia (near-sightedness) and presbyopia (age-related near
      vision decline). The gains were transferred to visual acuity,
      processing speed and reaction time. Thus, perceptual learning can
      become a practical method for improving visual functions in people
      with impaired or blurred vision.<br>

        </big></div>
      <br>
      In the ancient struggle between man and fish, man has a new
      weapon. Forget fancy lures, depth charges or precision casting
      guns. The new weapon requires vision -- ultraviolet vision. <br>
      <br>
      Called Fool-a-Fish, it comes in a bottle that sprays titanium
      dioxide on fishing lures and bait. The chemical lights up the
      watery depths like a disco ball, luring fish from half a mile
      away. <br>
      <br>
      "You catch three or four times more fish, and the biggest fish,"
      Jeckle contended. <br>
      <br>
      Researchers have discovered that while humans see in three colors
      -- red, yellow-green and blue -- fish and birds see a fourth color
      in the ultraviolet range, which shows up as a white glow, Jeckle
      said. This color is invisible to humans. <br>
      <br>
      Working with David Cleary, a chemistry professor at Spokane's
      Gonzaga University, Jeckle came up with the formula combining
      titanium dioxide, which is used in sunscreens, and several other
      chemicals. The whitish liquid dries quickly, and will stay on a
      lure for some two hours, he said. <br>
      <br>
      It is nontoxic, odorless and washes off with soap and water. But
      underwater it shines like a beacon to fish. Jeckle said many of
      the spray products currently used to lure fish are scent-based,
      because fish are known to search for food by smell. <br>
      <br>
      "This is based entirely on vision," Jeckle said. "This is a new
      way to fish." <br>
      <br>
      "It's not just blood that attracts sharks," he added. "They can
      see a swimmer half a mile away."<br>
      <br>
      Jeckle makes up batches of Fool-A-Fish in his kitchen. The spray
      is sold in some outdoor stores in the region, and it can be
      ordered on Jeckle's Web site. <br>
      <br>
      It is also getting written up in fishing magazines. Northwest
      Angler said the formula "makes it super easy for fish to see lures
      or baits from great distances."<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;Jeckle has also adapted his formula to produce Fool-A-Bird,
      which works on a reverse principle. Birds use ultraviolet vision
      to avoid humans, so Jeckle created a formula that when sprayed on
      a hunter's clothes, body and gun will absorb ultraviolet rays. <br>
      <br>
      "You spray it on yourself and they treat you like a tree trunk or
      a dead stump," Jeckle said. "They ignore you."<br>

      <b>BACKGROUND OF INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>[0002] 1. Field of Invention</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0003] The present invention relates generally to apparatus used
      in fishing activities, and more particularly to a spray coating
      applied to baits and lures which reacts with ultraviolet light to
      increase perceptibility by fish and crustaceans.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0004] 2. Background and Description of Prior Art</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0005] Color is an interpretation of light waves having a
      particular wavelength. While it is an organism's eye that receives
      light waves, it is the organism's brain that interprets those
      light waves and "sees" colors.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] A transparent lens called the cornea is at the front of the
      eye to allow light waves into the eye. Behind the cornea is the
      iris, which gives the eye its color. By changing size, the iris
      regulates the amount of light entering the pupil, which is the
      orifice defined by the iris. Located behind the iris is a
      crystalline lens which focuses the light rays entering the eye
      onto the retina. The retina is the inner most layer of the eye and
      is covered with photo receptor cells. Light waves enter the eye
      through the cornea, pass through the pupil are focused by the lens
      and strike the photo receptors on the retina.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] There are two types of photo receptors, rods and cones,
      which are named for their relative shapes. Rod type photo
      receptors perceive the intensity of light and enable an organism
      to see at night. Cone type photo receptors perceive the
      wavelengths of various light waves and enable the organism to
      distinguish colors.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] Humans are among the minority of mammals that have color
      vision. In the human eye, rods are found at the peripheral regions
      of the retina but are nearly absent from the center of the visual
      field, known as the fovea, where the cones are concentrated. The
      human eye has about 150,000 cones (color receptors) per square
      millimeter of fovea area. Humans' eyes have three variants of
      photo-receptive cones (known as red cones, blue cones and green
      cones) and for that reason humans are classified as trichromic
      organisms. Each variant of photo receptive cone carries a unique
      protein, called an opsin, that reacts when struck by light waves
      having wavelengths that correspond to the opsin's light
      sensitivity. It is unknown whether the reaction is physical,
      chemical or both. The reaction of the opsin is communicated to the
      brain allowing the organism to distinguish between red, blue and
      green colors. Thus, the world visually perceived by humans is
      dominated by light having wave lengths ranging from 400-750
      nanometers, or blue to red respectively.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] In contrast to humans, bony fish and crustaceans have
      tetra-chromic vision. The eyes of tetra-chromic organisms have
      four variants of photo receptive cones. In addition to having
      three variants of cones with opsins sensitive to red, green and
      blue light, bony fish and crustaceans have a fourth variant of
      cone with an opsin that is sensitive to UV light which
      presumptively enables the organism to perceive ultra violet light
      that is invisible to humans. The peak sensitivity of the opsin on
      this fourth variant of photo receptive cone is at about 358
      nanometers which is known as Ultra Violet A (UVA) light.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] As noted above, while a human eye has about 150,000 cones
      per square millimeter of fovea area, the eyes of bony fish and
      crustaceans have more than one million cones per square millimeter
      of fovea area. This large difference in the number of cone type
      photo receptors in the fovea presumptively provides bony fish and
      crustaceans with greater visual acuity than humans, as well as an
      ability to perceive UV light that is invisible to humans.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] Ultra violet light penetrates more deeply into water than
      visible light and ultraviolet light is abundant in near surface
      marine ecosystems. It is estimated there is sufficient UV light
      for UV vision down to a depth of approximately 200 meters in clear
      ocean water, while visible light penetrates clear ocean water to a
      depth of only approximately 20-40 meters. The current prevailing
      hypothesis is that UV vision is primarily used by fish and
      crustaceans to improve detection of prey.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] The prior art discloses various compositions and
      substances, commonly known as scents that allegedly make baits and
      lures more appealing to fish and crustaceans by means of olfactory
      stimulation. The instant composition is distinguishable from
      scents because it does not stimulate the olfactory senses but
      rather is a composition that presumptively appeals to the visual
      senses of fish and crustaceans.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] The instant invention reflects light, and especially UV
      light, off treated surfaces making baits and lure more perceptible
      to bony fish and crustaceans and theoretically more likely to
      cause the fish and crustacean to attempt to eat the treated bait
      or lure.<br>
      <br>
      [0014] The instant invention is a spray-on, quick drying, water
      resistant composition that promotes and enhances the effectiveness
      of natural and synthetic baits and lures in attracting fish and
      crustaceans. The composition presumptively functions by various
      methodologies including reflecting light waves, and especially UV
      light waves, at incident wave lengths, reflecting light waves at
      altered wave lengths, leaving a trail of light reflecting crystals
      as treated baits and lures move through the water, and it appears
      the composition may be doing more than merely reflecting light
      waves, and especially UV light waves, although the nature of how
      this might be occurring is presently unknown.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      [0015] My invention provides a spray-on, water resistant colloidal
      composition that reflects light and especially "UV" light. The
      composition is made in three individual phases which are heated
      and thereafter combined. The composition comprising distilled
      water, Carbopol ETD, Versene 100, Phenonip, Propylene glycol,
      Dermacryl 79, Triethanolamine, Tegosoft TN 2, Titanium dioxide,
      Tego Care 450 and Dow Corning 200/10 CST....<br>
      <br>
      <b>DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0028] The chemical ingredients used in the preferred embodiment
      of the composition are identified by chemical name and common
      trade name in Table 1. The International Nomenclature for Cosmetic
      Ingredients (INCI) chemical names have been provided. Other
      chemicals having the same properties but produced by other
      manufacturers and having different trade names may be equally
      suitable for manufacture of the composition.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] The instant invention provides a stable spray-on water
      resistant ultraviolet (UV) light reflective composition having the
      following ingredients:<br>

      Distilled Water&nbsp; water&nbsp; carrier medium<br>
      <br>
      [0030] The described process of manufacture forms a stable liquid
      colloidal composition that may be applied with a spray applicator
      or otherwise, and when dry forms a layered water resistant matrix
      having light reflective material, and especially UV light
      reflective material, therein.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] The light reflective Titanium dioxide crystals of the
      instant invention are insoluble in water by nature. Forming of a
      stable colloidal composition with such crystals requires that the
      crystals be stabilized so they will not separate from the carrier
      medium. Tego Care 450 and Tegosoft TN 2 are elongate molecules
      having one end portion that is hydrophilic and an opposing end
      portion that is hydrophobic. These elongate molecules adhere to
      the Titanium dioxide crystals so they do not coalesce and
      settle-out of the composition. The result is a stable colloidal
      composition with a water carrier medium holding the Titanium
      dioxide crystals in suspension. The inclusion of Phenonip, which
      is a preservative, and Dow Corning 200/10 CST, which is a surface
      smoother, in the composition is not essential to operability but
      is preferable to provide longer shelf-life and give the
      composition more appealing texture to both fish and user.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] The composition is made in three phases to maintain the
      proper pH balance for each phase and to ensure that the
      intermediate chemical reactions occur as desired. Manufacture in
      three separate phases also prevents undesirable premature
      reactions between ingredients of the separate phases with each
      other.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] Phase A. 309.60 milliliters of distilled water is added to
      a 5 liter beaker. A magnetic stir bar is placed in the beaker
      containing the water and operated to create a vortex in the water.
      0.90 grams of Carbopol ETD, which is a thickener, is slowly added
      to the beaker containing the distilled water and mixed for
      approximately 15 minutes while maintaining a vortex in the mixture
      throughout the mixing. Following the mixing, the Carbopol ETD
      should be evenly dispersed and all "fish-eyes" should have
      disappeared. 0.77 grams of Versene 100, which is a pH adjuster and
      chelating agent, is slowly added to the mixture of distilled water
      and Carbopol ETD and mixed with the magnetic stir bar at a
      moderate speed of approximately 5 revolutions per second. 0.35
      grams of Phenonip, which is a preservative, optionally is added to
      the mixture in the beaker to prevent bacterial or fungal growth in
      the composition. Phase A is mixed as described because the pH of
      the mixture is material. Versene 100 is a weak base and pH
      adjuster and also a chelating agent. When combined with water, the
      Versene 100 increases the pH of the mixture so that the Carbopol
      ETD is more completely drawn into colloidal suspension. Without
      inclusion of Versene 100, the Carbopol ETD has less colloidal
      suspension. The Phase A mixture is set aside.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] Phase B. 20.18 grams of Propylene Glycol, which is a
      solvent and cross-linking agent, is placed in a 2 liter beaker.
      10.00 grams of Dermacryl 79, which is a water resistant film
      forming polymer, is added to the beaker containing the Propylene
      Glycol and mixed by hand with a glass stir rod until all
      "fish-eyes" have disappeared. The result is a thick white oily
      paste. 3.55 grams of Triethanolamine, which is a pH buffer,
      emulsifier and chelating agent, is added to the mixture of
      Propylene Glycol and Dermacryl 79 and mixing is continued with the
      glass stir rod until the mixture appears to be a uniform thick
      white oily paste. The Dermacryl 79 combines with the
      Triethanolamine to create a reaction product which is soluble in
      water. The Propylene Glycol is an additional solvent that ensures
      that the Dermacryl 79 dissolves into the mixture completely.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] Combining Phase A and Phase B. The mixture made in Phase B
      is transferred into the 5 liter beaker containing the mixture made
      in Phase A. A stir bar is used to mix the Phase A and Phase B
      mixtures while heating the combined mixtures to 80[deg.] C. At
      first, the mixture of Phase B forms a separate layer on the
      surface of the Phase A mixture, but as the mixing and heating is
      continued the two mixtures thin and combine to form a homogeneous
      white mixture. The combined Phase A and Phase B mixture is
      maintained at 80[deg.] C.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] Phase C. 65.00 milliliters of distilled water, which is a
      carrier medium, is added to a 2 liter beaker and stirred with a
      magnetic stir bar at a moderate speed of approximately 5
      revolutions per second. 30.02 grams of Tegosoft TN2, which is an
      emulsifier and wetting agent, is added to the beaker containing
      the distilled water. The Tegosoft TN2 does not mix with the
      distilled water, but instead forms a separate layer on the surface
      of the distilled water. 25.06 grams of finely particulated forms
      of Titanium dioxide, which is a light reflectant, is added to the
      beaker containing the distilled water and the Tegosoft TN2. The
      Titanium dioxide does not immediately mix with either the Tegosoft
      TN2 or the distilled water but rather appears to settle in the
      bottom water layer as a combined suspension and sludge. 15.01
      grams of Tego Care 450, which is an emulsifier, is added to the
      beaker containing the foregoing Phase C mixture. The particles of
      Tego Care 450 do not combine with any of the other ingredients in
      the beaker, but instead fall to the bottom of the mixture. Because
      a magnetic stir bar is unable to stir the mixture by itself, a
      glass stir rod is used in combination with the magnetic stir bar.
      The combined methods of mixing cause a large portion of the Tego
      Care 450 particles to break up forming a suspension in the
      mixture. 15.05 grams of Dow Corning 200/10 CST, which is a surface
      smoother and lubricant for spray nozzles, is added to the beaker
      containing the Phase C mixture while the magnetic stir bar and
      glass stir rod mixing is continued and the mixture is heated to
      80[deg.] C. As the mixing and heating continue, the ingredients
      combine to form a homogenous liquid mixture having a light yellow
      color that thickens as it is heated. The Tegosoft TN2 and the Tego
      Care 450 hold the Titanium dioxide crystals in suspension. The
      Tegosoft TN 2 also enhances the uniform distribution of the
      Titanium dioxide crystals throughout the mixture.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] Combining Phase C with the Phase A and Phase B combination.
      After being heated to 80[deg.] C., Phase C is added to the 5 liter
      beaker containing the combination of Phase A and Phase B mixtures
      already at 80[deg.] C. The newly combined mixture is held at
      80[deg.] C. for approximately 15 minutes while mixing with a
      magnetic stir bar continues until a thick white homogenous mixture
      forms in the beaker.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] The mixture is allowed to cool to approximately 35[deg.] C.
      and is then diluted with distilled water at a volume ratio of four
      parts distilled water to one part mixture. Thereafter, the diluted
      colloidal mixture is mechanically homogenized at approximately
      25,000 rpm for a period of approximately five minutes.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] Testing of the ultraviolet light reflectance of this
      composition showed the following:<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 1</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0040] A transparent coating of the colloidal composition was
      applied to a glass slide with a spray bottle and allowed to dry.
      The transparent layer is not visible on a test slide without
      magnification. An uncoated glass control slide provided a
      comparison measurement for reflectance. The slides were
      simultaneously exposed to a single light source and reflectance of
      the light from the test slide and the control slide was measured
      for light having wave lengths of 350 nanometers and 450
      nanometers. The measurements showed the test slide, having the
      transparent layer of the composition, reflected approximately 43%
      more 350 nanometer light waves than the control slide, and 50%
      more 450 nanometer light waves than the control slide.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 2</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0041] A translucent layer of the composition was applied to a
      glass slide with a spray bottle and allowed to dry. The
      translucent layer has a slightly milky appearance and is visible
      on a test slide without magnification, but is not opaque. An
      uncoated glass control slide provided a comparison measurement of
      reflectance. The slides were simultaneously exposed to a single
      light source and reflectance of the light from the test slide and
      the control slide was measured for light having wave lengths of
      350 nanometers and 450 nanometers. The measurements showed the
      test slide, having the translucent layer of the composition,
      reflected approximately 292% more 350 nanometer light waves than
      the control slide, and 275% more 450 nanometer light waves than
      the control slide.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] Having described the structure and composition of my
      ultraviolet light reflective colloidal composition its use and
      operation may be understood.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] In the preferred method of application, a bait 10 or lure
      (not shown) is secured to a fishing line 12 or hook 11 in
      customary fashion, or the bait 10 is placed in a bait apparatus
      such as a crustacean trap. The bait 10 or lure is coated with the
      instant composition, preferably using a spray type applicator of
      known construction, such that the exterior surfaces of the bait 10
      or lure are coated. The composition is allowed to dry, which takes
      approximately 1-5 minutes depending upon temperature and humidity
      conditions. Thereafter the bait or lure is used in a customary
      fashion.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] Although the composition is stable and water resistant, it
      may be necessary to reapply the composition to baits and lures
      after a period of use and after extended exposure to the water and
      strikes by fish.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] Use of the ultraviolet light reflecting coating composition
      on a worm is shown in FIG. 1 wherein there is seen a bait 10, a
      worm in this illustration, carried on a hook 11 attached to a
      fishing line 12, with or without an intervening lure or flasher
      (not shown). Light rays 13 striking and reflected from the bait 10
      are as indicated by the arrows thereon. This illustration would
      represent a relatively static positioning of the bait 10 in water
      as in the case of still fishing.<br>
      <br>
      [0046] The illustration of FIG. 2 shows the bait of FIG. 1 as it
      would appear if moving forwardly, to the left, in a body of water,
      as in the case of trolling or casting and retrieving. Here, some
      of the diagrammatically illustrated crystals of Titanium dioxide
      14 are removed from, and with portions of the instant coating
      composition (not shown), to leave a particulated trail about and
      behind the coated bait 10 as it passes through the surrounding
      water to further attract fish and ultimately draw the attention of
      fish to the bait 10.<br>

      <div align="center"><big><b>Welcome Back to Medieval Dark Ages</b></big><br>
      </div>
      &nbsp;<br>
      Welcome!<br>
      <br>
      It is the dawn of The Great Dark Ages – again. The glorious age of
      ruthless oppression and tyranny, the era when all the wealth and
      resources of the land and the people were the property of the
      feudal lords, is almost upon us.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      During those glorious days, the kings and lords owned the land and
      the people. People worked for their lords until they die. It was
      with the grace of the lord that they had the sustenance to survive
      to the next day. When they wed, the first night their wives were
      the property of the lord – Lords loved the tenderness of the
      virgins.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      People owned nothing. Whatever they had was at the mercy of the
      lords. The lords could block the exit and entry to their shoddy
      homes – inflicting death by starvation.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      The word of the lord was the ‘Law’. And, the lords has the
      enforcers to establish the ‘rule of law’. The enforcers of the law
      – the police of the lords, had the license to harass, torture,
      rape, and kill anyone with impunity. People had no rights – no
      education, no health care, and no amenities. They lived to serve
      their lords, and die serving the lords.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      After a short respite, back we go to the glorious Dark Ages of The
      Medieval Times – to faithfully serve the masters again.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      <b>The Medieval Times:</b><br>
      <br>
      Until the later part of the 16th century, the entire western
      Europe, with the exception of Moorish Europe – Spain, Portugal,
      southern France and Italy, was in the ‘Dark Ages’ – under the
      harsh feudal rule, zero tolerance, and extreme poverty, the life
      for ‘common people was a living hell. Thanks to malnutrition,
      infectious diseases, lack of sanitary and personal hygiene, and
      non-existence of health care, the life expectancy of common people
      was well under 32 years.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      <b>The Brief Respite:</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      With the fall of the Moore Empire in 1492, the door to Knowledge
      and Science got opened and the Era of Renaissance downed upon
      Europe. People came to realize that Earth was not flat, and they
      too were humans – And, with that realization came the era of
      awareness and unrest in the region. The resulting public awareness
      forced the lords to bestow some rights back to the people.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      It was the dawn of the Golden Age for the West.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      People – the subject of the same old lords, were allowed to enjoy
      their new found ‘freedom’ for almost two centuries while producing
      more wealth for the masters – and killing each others in millions.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      While the people in the West were allowed to enjoy there freedom,
      the Lords of the Darkness had shifted their loving attention to
      the East. The rest of the was put under the yolk of slavery. In
      the world beyond Europe, it was suppression of human rights,
      freedom, and civil liberties. In the land of lawlessness, the word
      of the master was The Law.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      While the masses all over the world suffer, West had the good
      times. The West – Europe and the US, were perceived as the
      “beacon” of freedom, democracy, and human rights in the world –
      The land of the Free – The land of the Rule of Law, Reasoning, and
      Logic. The land where the individual safety, security and peaceful
      enjoyment was guaranteed.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      <b>Back to Medieval Dark Ages:</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Now, the lords have gotten fed up with the ever increasing demands
      and self-indulgence of their western subjects, and have decided to
      put them back into the Era where they belong – The Era of Glorious
      Medieval dark Ages.<br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      The Wheel of Fortune has been made to make 180° turn. While the
      freedom and human rights are taking the front row seat in the rest
      of the world, the West is turning into a suffocating hell of
      tyranny, oppression, and intolerance.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      The process of unraveling, dismantling, and tearing apart the
      social and civil fabrics of the western society at the seams is in
      full swing.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      The Lords of the Dark Ages are systematically dismantling, and
      tearing down the mask of ‘civilization and humanity’ from the face
      of West. The processes are in full swing to usher in the Golden
      Age of the Medieval Feudal tyranny again – Albeit with one twist,
      this time around the lords will not be responsible to feed their
      subjects.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      Coming to you is the Fascism married to Feudalism, with the
      ruthless Dictatorship as the favorite Concubine.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      <b>The Pillars Supporting The Feudal Fascist System:</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      <b>The Police State:</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The moment one lands at any of the airports in the West, it is
      difficult to escape the realization that one has entered into an
      occupied and hostile region – your life is at the mercy of those
      with badges and guns.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      Police has been fully militarized and acts like an occupation
      force. Police brutality is beyond description. They shoot and kill
      people with impunity – it is a force created and trained to
      terrorize the public. Its task is to protect the interests of the
      ruling elites. As the US Supreme Court clarified in its recent
      ruling, police’s job is NOT to protect people, its job is to
      enforce the ‘law’ – The law of the lords.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      <b>Welcome to the Medieval Age of Feudal Lords.</b><b><br>
      </b>&nbsp;<br>
      <b>State of Lawlessness:</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      There is no more Rule of the Law in the West. Laws are made at the
      whim of those who rule. Judges are selected by the ruling elites
      to serve the interests of the masters. Any judge who dares to
      deviate from the given command or directive is “suicided” to make
      an example. Court’s job is to rubber-stamp the dictate of the
      lords and guard the interests of the lords – Recall: The Affluenza
      Ruling in Texas!<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      <b>The Age of the Executive Orders:</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The heads and the figureheads of the governments, on behalf of
      their masters, rule the nations by way of executive orders.
      Legislative bodies’ job is, on cue, to simply prompt the executive
      head to make the EO’s as deemed necessary for imposition of the
      Medieval Time.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      <b>Secret Courts, Secret Laws, and Secret Interpretations:</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Beside the rule by EOs, a system of secret courts has been
      established to prosecute the ‘undesired’ elements. these courts
      follow the ‘secret laws’ whose interpretations are also secret!<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      <b>Indefinite Detentions – Guilty until Proven Innocent:</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The governments can snatch anyone without ever charging or even
      acknowledging the arrest. You may simply disappear – like many
      already have. Government doesn’t need to bring any charges. You
      have no rights.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      <b>Gag Orders:</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The accused, if he were lucky to be charged in the first place,
      can be put under a ‘Gag Order’. You are not allowed to defend
      yourself – Neither is your attorney. You are gagged!<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      <b>The Land of The Inhuman Tortures :</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Torturing innocent people, snatched and kidnapped by the
      governments, is an accepted way of controlling the people. Inhuman
      assaults on detainees, including rape and beating to death are
      acknowledged practices. Such tortures are deliberately “leaked” to
      further terrorize the public even more.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      Secret trials, gag orders, indefinite detentions, and inhuman
      tortures – the hallmark of a dictatorial fascist system, are the
      norm.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      <b>Consolidation of Wealth &amp; Ownership:</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The Financial collapse of 2008 was thoughtfully created to
      decimate the public equity, confiscate the wealth of common
      people, create a population of millions of homeless families,
      disconnect millions more from the credit system, and, through
      hyper inflation and mass unemployment, destroy the lives of a very
      large segment of the population.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      Through the real estate market crash and the subsequent
      foreclosures, the wealth-base of millions of people all over the
      West was destroyed. Now, the super wealthy class, the new lords of
      the descending Medieval Age, control almost all the national
      resources, and own more than 80% of the worthwhile assets. <br>
      <br>
      <b>Public ownership is on fast decline</b><b><br>
      </b>&nbsp;<br>
      Further to increase the gap between the Lords and the poor public,
      the working classes are skinned to death with the ever increasing
      tax burden, cost of utilities, food prices, and the housing
      expenses. People are practically in bondage already.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      <b>Privatization of Public Assets:</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      All over the West, public assets – from land, water, and food to
      roads, railways, and airways, have been handed over to the super
      rich. Public is at the mercy of the lords again. The Working class
      owns nothing; neither money nor assets.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      <b>Dwindling Income and Rising Cost:</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Vast majority of people have been forced work on meager wages
      insufficient to sustain and maintain even the basic essential for
      living. With the ever increasing cost of living, they are forced
      to survive on government ‘dole outs’ – An old tactic of the feudal
      lord – keep them hand-to-mouth – always looking for the mercy of
      the lords.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      <b>Education Beyond the Reach of Public:</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The entire education system, the pride jewel of the West – built
      over a period of centuries, has been hollowed and dynamited –
      serving the needs of the lords by stamping out the faithful
      servants of the masters. Further, the cost of higher education has
      been inflated so much that it is beyond the means of ordinary
      people.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      For the most, education is not required – actually, made
      prohibited by virtue of exorbitant cost that they cannot afford.
      Like the Golden days of the Feudal system.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      Through planned inflation of the cost of education, housing, and
      all the other major necessities of living, an economy of debt has
      been created – A society made ready to fall prey to the feudal
      lords.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      <b>Suppression of Freedom of Speech:</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      No Freedom of Speech here – unless it is approved!<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      You have the complete freedom of speech, as long as you toe the
      line of the masters. Selective protection of the “Freedom of
      Speech”, while targeting and prosecuting the ‘undesired Freedom of
      Speech’, is the rule – The doctrine of Freedom of Speech doesn’t
      apply to the likes of 70-year-old writer, publisher and civil
      rights activist, Ernst Zundel or the British cartoonists, Stephen
      Whittle and Simon Sheppard or the French comedian Dieudonné.
      Freedom doesn’t fit the model of Medieval Feudal system.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      <b>Dumbification of the Masses:</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Free thinking and intelligent public doesn’t belong in the
      Medieval times. The populace, therefore, has been ‘dumbified’ to
      such a degree that they are incapable of analyzing the fact and
      making rational decisions to protect themselves and their
      communities – A collection of sheeples ready for the butcher’s
      block of the Feudal Lords – Thanks in great part to the shows like
      ‘Kardashain’s’ and Duck Dynasty’.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      <b>Legalization of Drugs &amp; Prostitution:</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Drugs are already being legalized across the board. An intoxicated
      population is easy to dupe into serving the the lords – Recall:
      The ‘Opiumization’ of China. It has come full circle – the
      roosters have come back home to roost.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      Prostitution, already ‘Legal’ in many places, is next in line to
      be legalized and promoted as ‘essential service’ – Remember Russia
      of Yeltsin era? Wives, even the wives of generals, had to do the
      ‘street job’ to supplement the husband’s meager wages. It is
      coming to you too.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      But here is the Silver Line: As an acknowledgment of the dedicated
      service, the Lords, as a favor to their subject, will do the
      promotion and marketing for the prostituting wives, sisters, and
      daughters of the subject for free!<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      Prostitution is going to be an important sector of the economy –
      an integral part of GDP. The wealthy Chinese will have a good time
      while you will be able to put loves of bread on the tiny table.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Mass Surveillance:</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      A system of mass surveillance has been imposed in which no one has
      the right to privacy. From your phone calls and emails to the
      details of your shopping, very thing is monitored. You are a state
      property. Even your thoughts belong to the lords – Like the old
      days<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      <b>Private Security and Mercenary forces:</b><b><br>

      On the lines of the old Medieval Feudal system, provisions have
      been made into the law for the major businesses and super wealthy
      to hire and maintain their own private ‘security forces’, with
      power to arrest and detain the citizens who may be perceived as
      posing a threat to the interests of their masters -The dawn of the
      era of Feudal Fascism.<br>

      This blog is dedicated to the idea of presenting the big picture —
      the biggest possible — of what is going on in the world. The
      abiding areas of interest that make up the big picture have
      included the following:<br>
      <br>
      1. The terminal decay and eventual collapse of industrial
      civilization as the fossil fuels that power it become more and
      more expensive to produce in the needed quantities, of lower and
      lower resource quality and net energy and, eventually, in
      ever-shorter supply.<br>
      <br>
      The first guess by Hubbert that the all-time peak of oil
      production in the US would be back in the 1970s was accurate, but
      later prediction of a global peak, followed by a swift collapse,
      around the year 2000 was rather off, because here we are 15 years
      later and global oil production has never been higher. Oil prices,
      which were high for a time, have temporarily moderated. However,
      zooming in on the oil picture just a little bit, we see that
      conventional oil production peaked in 2005 — just 5 years late —
      and has been declining ever since, and the shortfall has been made
      up by oil that is difficult and expensive to get at (deep
      offshore, fracking) and by things that aren't exactly oil (tar
      sands).<br>
      <br>
      The current low prices are not high enough to sustain this new,
      expensive production for much longer, and the current glut is
      starting to look like a feast to be followed by famine. The direct
      cause of this famine will not be energy but debt, but it can still
      be traced back to energy: a successful, growing industrial economy
      requires cheap energy; expensive energy causes it to stop growing
      and to become mired in debt that can never be repaid. Once the
      debt bubble pops, there isn't enough capital to invest in another
      round of expensive energy production, and terminal decay sets in.<br>
      <br>
      2. The very interesting process of the USA becoming its own
      nemesis: the USSR 2.0, or, as some are calling, the USSA.<br>
      <br>
      The USA is best characterized as a decomposing corpse of a nation
      lorded over by a tiny clique of oligarchs who control the herd by
      wielding Orwellian methods of mind control. So far gone is the
      populace that most of them think that things are just peachy —
      there is an economic recovery, don't you know — but a few of them
      do realize that they all have lots of personal issues with things
      like violence, drug and alcohol abuse, and gluttony. But don't
      call them a nation of violent, drug-abusing gluttons, because that
      would be insulting. In any case, you can't call them anything,
      because they aren't listening, for they are too busy fiddling with
      their electronic life support units to which they have become
      addicted. Thanks to Facebook and the like they are now so far
      inside Plato's cave that even the shadows they see aren't real:
      they are computer simulations of shadows of other computer
      simulations.<br>
      <br>
      The signs of this advanced state of decomposition are now
      unmistakable everywhere you look, be it education, medicine,
      culture or the general state of American society, where now fully
      half the working-age men is impaired in their ability to earn a
      decent living. But it is now particularly obvious in the endless
      compounding of errors that is the essence of American foreign
      policy. Some have started calling it “the empire of chaos,”
      neglecting to mention the fact that an empire of chaos is by
      definition ungovernable.<br>
      <br>
      A particularly compelling example o failure is the Islamic
      Caliphate, which now rules large parts of Syria and Iraq. It was
      initially organized with American help topple the Syrian
      government, but which now threatens the stability of Saudi Arabia
      instead. This problem was made much worse by alienating Russia,
      which, with its long Central Asian border, is the one major nation
      that is interested in fighting Islamic extremism. The best the
      Americans have been able to do against the Caliphate is an
      expensive and ineffectual bombing campaign. Previous ineffectual
      and expensive bombing campaigns, such as the one in Cambodia, have
      produced unintended consequences such as the genocidal regime of
      Pol Pot, but why bother learning from mistakes when you can
      endlessly compound them?<br>
      <br>
      Another example is the militarized mayhem and full-blown economic
      collapse that has engulfed the Ukraine in the wake of
      American-organized violent overthrow of its last-ever
      constitutional government a year ago. The destruction of the
      Ukraine was motivated by Zbigniew Brzezinski's simplistic calculus
      that turning the Ukraine into an anti-Russian NATO-occupied zone
      would effectively thwart Russian imperial ambitions. A major
      problem with this calculus is that Russia has no imperial
      ambitions: Russia has all the territory it could ever want, but to
      develop it it needs peace and free trade. Another slight problem
      with Zbiggy's “chessboard” is that Russia does have an overriding
      concern with protecting the interests of Russians wherever they
      may live and, for internal political reasons, will always act to
      protect them, even if such actions are illegal and carry the risk
      of a larger military conflict. Thus, the American destabilization
      of the Ukraine has accomplished nothing positive, but did increase
      the odds of nuclear self-annihilation. But if the USA manages to
      disappear from the world's political map without triggering a
      nuclear holocaust, we will still have a problem, which is that...<br>
      <br>
      3. The climate of Earth, our home planet, is, to put it as
      politely as possible, completely fucked. Now, there are quite a
      few people who think that radically altering the planet's
      atmospheric and ocean chemistry and physics by burning just over
      half the fossilized hydrocarbons that could possibly be dug up
      using industrial means nothing, and that what we are observing is
      just natural climate variability. These people are morons. I will
      delete every single one of the comments they submit in response to
      this post, but in spite of my promise to do so, I assure you that
      they will still submit them... because they are morons.<br>
      <br>
      What we are looking at is a human-triggered extinction episode
      that will certainly be beyond anything in human experience, and
      which may rival the great Permian-Triassic extinction event of 252
      million years ago. There is even the possibility of Earth becoming
      completely sterilized, with an atmosphere as overheated and toxic
      as that of Venus. That these changes are happening does not
      require prediction, just observation. The only parameters that
      remain to be determined are these:<br>
      <br>
      1. How far will this process run? Will there still be a habitat
      where humans can survive? Humans cannot survive without plenty of
      fresh water and sources of carbohydrates, proteins and fats, all
      of which require functioning ecosystems. Humans can survive on
      almost any kind of diet — even tree bark and insects— but if all
      vegetation is dead, then so are we. Also, we cannot survive in an
      environment where the wet bulb temperature (which takes into
      account our ability to cool ourselves by sweating) exceeds our
      body temperature: whenever that happens, we die of heat stroke.
      Lastly, we need air that we can actually breathe: if the
      atmosphere becomes too low in oxygen (because the vegetation has
      died out) and too high in carbon dioxide and methane (because the
      dead vegetation has burned off, the permafrost has melted, and the
      methane currently trapped in oceanic clathrates has been released)
      then we all die.<br>
      <br>
      We already know that the increase in average global temperature
      has exceeded 1C since pre-industrial times, and, based on the
      altered atmospheric chemistry, is predicted to eventually exceed
      2C. We also know that industrial activity, thanks to the aerosols
      it puts into the atmosphere, produces an effect known as global
      dimming. Once it's gone, the average temperature will jump by at
      least another 1.1C. This would put us within striking range of
      3.5C, and no humans have ever been alive with Earth more than 3.5C
      above baseline. But, you know, there is a first time for
      everything. Maybe we can invent some gizmo... Maybe if we all put
      on air-conditioned sombreros or something... (Design contest,
      anyone?)<br>
      <br>
      2. How fast will this process happen?<br>
      <br>
      The thermal mass of the planet is such that there is a 40-year lag
      between when atmospheric chemistry is changed and its effects on
      average temperature are felt. So far we have been shielded from
      some of the effects by two things: the melting of Arctic and
      Antarctic ice and permafrost, and the ocean's ability to absorb
      heat. Your iced drink remains pleasant until the last ice cube is
      gone, but then it becomes tepid and distasteful rather quickly.
      Some scientists say that, on the outside, it will take 5000 years
      for us to run out of ice cubes, causing the party to end, but then
      the dynamics of the huge glaciers that supply the ice cubes are
      not understood all that well, and there have been constant
      surprises in terms of how quickly they can slough off icebergs,
      which then drift into warmer waters and melt quickly.<br>
      <br>
      But the biggest surprise of the last few years has been the rate
      of arctic methane release. Perhaps you haven't, but I've found it
      impossible to ignore all the scientists who have been ringing
      alarm bells on Arctic methane release. What they are calling the
      clathrate gun — which can release some 50 gigatons of methane in
      as little as a couple of decades — appears to have been fired in
      2007 and now, just a few years later, the trend line in Arctic
      methane concentrations has become alarming. But we will need to
      wait for at least another two years to get an authoritative
      answer. Overall, the methane held in the clathrates is enough to
      exceed the global warming potential of all fossil fuels burned to
      date by a factor of between 4 and 40. The upper end of that range
      does seem to put us quite far towards a Venus-type atmosphere, and
      the surviving species may be limited to exotic thermophilic
      bacteria, if that, and certainly will not include any of the
      species we like to eat, nor any of us.<br>
      <br>
      Looking at such numbers has caused quite a few researchers to
      propose the possibility of near-term human extinction. Estimates
      vary, but, in general, if the clathrate gun has indeed gone off,
      then most of us shouldn't be planning to be around beyond
      mid-century. But the funny thing is (humor is never in poor taste,
      no matter how dire the situation) that most of us shouldn't be
      planning on sticking around beyond mid-century in any case. The
      current oversized human population is a product of fossil
      fuel-burning, and once that's over, human population will crash.
      This is called a die-off, and it's something that happens all the
      time: a population (say, of yeast in a vat of sugary liquid)
      consumes its food, and then dies off. A few hardy individuals
      linger on, and if you throw in a lump of sugar, they spring to
      life, start reproducing and the process takes off again.<br>
      <br>
      Another funny aspect of near-term human extinction is that it can
      never be observable, because no scientist will ever be around to
      observe it, and therefore it is a non-scientific concept. Since it
      cannot be used to do science, the scientists who throw it around
      must be aiming for an emotional effect. This is quite
      uncharacteristic of scientists, who generally pride themselves on
      being cool-headed and prefer to deal in the observable and the
      measurable. So, why would scientists go for emotional effect?
      Clearly, it is because they feel that something must be done. And
      to feel that something must be done, they must also feel that
      something can be done. But, if so, what is it?<br>
      <br>
      Always first on the list is the effort to lobby governments to
      limit carbon emissions. This has not been a success; as to one of
      the many reasons why, consider point 2 above: the USA is one of
      the biggest offenders when it comes to carbon emissions, but the
      rotting corpse of America's political system is incapable of any
      constructive action. It is too busy destroying countries: Iraq,
      Libya, Syria, Ukraine...<br>
      <br>
      Second on the list is something called geoengineering. If you
      don't know what it is, don't worry; it's largely a synonym for
      mental masturbation. The idea is that you fix things you don't
      understand by using technologies that don't exist. But given many
      humans' irrational belief that every problem must have a
      technological solution, there is always some fool willing to throw
      money at it. Previous efforts along these lines involved the idea
      of seeding the oceans with iron to promote plankton growth, or
      putting bits of tin foil in orbit to reflect some of the sunlight,
      or painting the Sahara white. These are all fun projects to think
      about. How about using nuclear weapons to put dust into the
      atmosphere, to block out some of the sunlight? Or how about nuking
      a few big volcanos, for the same effect? If that's politically
      difficult, how about something politically easy: a limited nuclear
      exchange? That will darken the skies, bringing on a mini nuclar
      winter, and also reduce the population, which will cut down on
      industrial activity. There are enough nuclear weapons to keep the
      planet cool for as long as it takes us all to die of radiation
      poisoning. This geoengineering solution, along with all the
      others, is in line with the popular dictum “If you can't solve a
      problem, enlarge it.”<br>
      <br>
      And so it seems to me that all the talk about near-term human
      extinction is just so much emotional hand-flapping designed to
      motivate people to try things that won't work. Still, I believe
      the topic is worth pondering, for a simple reason: what if you
      don't want to go extinct? We've already established that human
      extinction (whenever it might be said to occur) will never be
      observable, because no human will be around to observe it. We also
      know that population die-offs happen all the time, but they don't
      always result in extinction. So, who will be most likely to die,
      and who might actually make it?<br>
      <br>
      First on the list are the invisible victims of war. By now lots of
      people have seen photographs of piles of dead Ukrainian soldiers
      left to rot after another failed attack, or videos of residents of
      Donetsk expiring on the sidewalk after being hit by a government
      artillery shell or mortar. But we don't know how many children and
      women are dying in childbirth because the government has bombed
      maternity clinics and hospitals: such casualties of war are
      invisible. Nor will we be shown footage of all of the Ukrainian
      retirees expiring prematurely because they can no longer afford
      food, medicine or heat, but we can be sure that many of them won't
      be around a year hence. When it comes to war, there are just two
      viable survival strategies: refuse to take part; and flee. Indeed,
      the million or so Ukrainians that are now in Russia, or the
      million or so Syrians who are no longer in Syria, are the smart
      ones. The Ukrainians who are volunteering to fight are the idiots;
      the ones who are fleeing to Russia to sit out the war are the
      smart ones. (However, the Russians, who are volunteering to
      protect their land and their families from what amounts to an
      American invasion, are clearly not idiots. They are also winning.)
      In this sense, war is a Darwinian process, delivering extinction
      to the foolish.<br>
      <br>
      Next on the list of extinction episodes to avoid happens in major
      cities during a heat wave. It's happened across Europe in 2003,
      and resulted in 70,000 casualties. In 2010, a heat wave in the
      Moscow region (which is quite far north) resulted in over 14,000
      deaths in Moscow alone. The urban heat effect, which is caused by
      heat soaked up by pavement and buildings, produces much higher
      local temperatures, driving them over the threshold for heat
      stroke. While the fossil fuel economy continues to operate, cities
      remain survivable because of the availability of air conditioning;
      once it shuts down, urban heat wave extinction episodes will
      become widespread. Since 50% of the population lives in cities,
      half of the human population is at risk of extinction from heat
      stroke. Therefore, if you don't want to go extinct, don't spend
      your summers in a city.<br>
      <br>
      The list of places you don't want to be if you wish to avoid
      extinction gets rather long. You wouldn't want to live in
      California, for example, or in the arid southwestern states,
      because there won't be any water there. You wouldn't want to live
      along the coasts, because they are likely to be flooded by the
      rising oceans (they will eventually rise over 100 meters, putting
      all coastal cities underwater). You wouldn't want to live in the
      eastern half of North America, because, paradoxically, a
      dramatically warmer Arctic region causes the jet stream to
      meander, producing increasingly fierce winters, which, minus
      fossil fuels, will cause widespread deaths from exposure. Even
      now, a bit of extra snow, which is likely to become the new
      normal, has caused the entire transportation infrastructure of New
      England (where, luckily, I am not) to roll over and play dead. Nor
      would you want to live in any of the places where the water source
      comes from glacial melt, because the glaciers will soon be gone.
      This includes much of Pakistan, large parts of India, Bangladesh,
      Thailand, Vietnam and so on. The list of places where you wouldn't
      want to be if you don't want to go extinct for this or that reason
      gets to be rather long.<br>
      <br>
      But the entire northern half of Eurasia looks quite nice for the
      foreseeable future, so if you don't want to go extinct, you better
      start teaching your kids Russian.<br>
