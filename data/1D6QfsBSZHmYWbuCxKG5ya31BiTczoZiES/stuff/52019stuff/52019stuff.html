              population has declined by three quarters in the last 30
              years and many species have become extinct. And it's all
              man's fault. This documentary looks at the dramatic
              consequences of this hitherto unrecognized catastrophe.<br>
              <br>
              The results of long-term monitoring published in 2017 have
              confirmed that as much as 75 percent of the world’s insect
              population has disappeared in the last 30 years. The
              extent of species extinction is so vast that many
              researchers fear that it will knock the entire natural
              cycle of life out of balance. Not only the decline of the
              bee population but mass insect mortality as a whole will
              have devastating consequences for all the Earth’s
              inhabitants. Top scientists from around the globe are
              warning that the developments are much more widespread and
              serious than anyone had realized. Many animals feed on
              insects. Insects also help to convert dead tissue into
              nutrient-rich soil. In addition, they even regulate each
              other. Species that humans see as pests are often the
              preferred prey of useful predators. But massive human
              intervention has thrown the functioning balance in the
              insect world out of whack. Chemical poisons, the
              progressive sealing of soils and the widespread use of
              fertilizers are affecting the world's most species-rich
              animal class. This documentary looks at current studies
              and explains what is going wrong and where urgent action
              is needed. There's still some hope: although many species
              have been irrevocably lost, mass extinction in the insect
              kingdom could still be stopped - but only if humans
              finally begin to act against it. And we're running out of
              time.</font><b><font color="#000000"><br>

              the addition of extrinsic chronic ultraviolet
              radiation-induced damage on intrinsic ageing and accounts
              for most age-associated changes in skin appearance. In
              this study, we evaluated the effect of 38% BPF, a highly
              concentrated extract of the bergamot fruit (Citrus
              bergamia) on UVB-induced photoageing by examining
              inflammatory cytokine expression, telomere
              length/telomerase alterations and cellular viability in
              human immortalized HaCaT keratinocytes. Our results
              suggest that 38% BPF protects HaCaT cells against
              UVB-induced oxidative stress and markers of photoageing in
              a dose-dependent manner and could be a useful supplement
              in skin care products. Together with antioxidant
              properties, BPF, a highly concentrated extract of the
              bergamot fruit, appears to modulate basic cellular signal
              transduction pathways leading to anti-proliferative,
              anti-aging and immune modulating responses.<br>

              </font></b><font color="#000000">Aging is one of the main
              risk factor for the onset of cardiovascular diseases; one
              of the possible explanations could be linked to the
              age-associated overproduction of free radicals. This
              increase of oxidative stress can be overcome with a high
              intake of food antioxidants. In this context, a number of
              studies have been addressed to assess the antiaging
              potential of natural antioxidant compounds. Recently, it
              has been shown that the juice of bergamot (Citrus bergamia
              Risso et Poiteau), a fruit mostly produced in the Ionian
              coastal areas of Southern Italy (Calabria), is a valuable
              source of health-promoting constituents with, among other,
              antioxidant properties. In order to investigate the
              potential antiaging effects of this Mediterranean natural
              antioxidant source, bergamot juices of three different
              cultivars (“fantastico,” “femminello,” and “castagnaro”)
              were herein characterized by the mean of high-performance
              liquid chromatography-photodiode array-electrospray
              ionization-tandem mass spectrometry. Then, juices were
              investigated for the evaluation of total polyphenolic and
              flavonoid contents, cell-free model antioxidant
              activities, and in vitro antiaging properties on two
              different cellular models of induced myocardial
              senescence. The best performing juice was also assessed in
              vivo. The phytochemical profiles confirmed that juices
              were rich in flavonoids, both flavone and flavanone
              glycosides. In addition, two limonoid glycosides were also
              identified in all cultivars. Each cultivar showed
              different phenolic and flavonoid contents. In tube results
              showed the juice robust antioxidant activities that
              correlate with their phenolic and flavonoid contents.
              Moreover, for the first time, the ability of juice to
              counteract the chemical-induced senescence was here
              demonstrated in both cellular models. Lastly, the in vivo
              data obtained from mouse hearts evidenced an increase in
              transcription of genes involved in antiaging and
              antioxidant responses. The overall results suggest that
              bergamot juice exerts antioxidant and antisenescence
              effects, making it useful for nutraceutical purposes....<br>

              </font></b><font color="#000000">Essential oils are used
              for their reputed health benefits; reversal of
              inflammation, oxidative damage, and infection are some of
              the therapeutic effects that essential oils are believed
              to possess. In many cases, there is scientific evidence to
              back these claims. However, the purported anti-aging
              effects of essential oils are not yet supported by the
              literature. We set out to evaluate the effects of 31 oils
              on telomere length, believed to play a role in cellular
              senescence. Cells were subjected to oils in the presence
              or absence of hydrogen peroxide, and changes in telomere
              length were measured using a PCR-based assay. Two oils
              which showed telomere-protective effects were further
              characterized using a cytogenetic assay, staining for
              telomeres. Significant variability was seen among these
              oils with respect to their ability to induce an apparent
              increase or decrease in telomere length, and to protect
              against peroxideinduced telomere damage. Expression
              analysis showed that telomere-protective oils did not
              increase telomerase (hTERT) gene transcription, but
              reduced TERF-1, a suppressor of telomere length. Though
              this mechanism is not yet understood, these data provide a
              base upon which the community can build, and represent the
              first formal scientific foray into the study of essential
              oils on the telomere. Conclusion: Certain essential oils,
              including those from basil and rosemary, appear to have
              telomere-protective effects, mediated through a reduction
              of the TERF-1 telomere-suppressive protein...<br>
              <br>
              It is of interest to note that some essential oils cause
              apparent increases in telomere length over those seen in
              untreated cells, when administered alone. In many cases,
              and especially following treatment with basil, clove or
              rosemary oils, the telomere-shortening effects of hydrogen
              peroxide are mitigated by EO treatment, leading to
              telomeres 60-80% of the size of those in untreated control
              cells. These data prompted us to verify the
              telomereprotecting effects of these oils in additional
              assays...<br>

                Conclusion<br>
              </font></b><font color="#000000">After evaluation of 31
              commonly-used therapeutic essential oils, we have shown
              here that certain of these, including oils from basil
              (Ocimum basilicum) and rosemary Rosmarinus officinalis CT
              cineol are capable of increasing the apparent length of
              telomeres in cell culture, when administered at low
              (subtoxic) doses. This effect was demonstrated using a
              previously-described PCR-based telomere length assay, and
              verified by qualitative cytogenetic analysis. Gene
              expression analysis revealed that these oils did not cause
              a concomitant increase in the expression of hTERT, the
              gene coding for the catalytic subunit of the telomerase
              protein complex, but instead downregulated the TERF-1
              telomere length suppressor. We conclude that essential
              oils may have potential use as a supplement to impact
              cellular senescence, once this mechanism has been fully
              elucidated....<br>

          <font color="#660000"><font color="#000000"><br>
              Thymoquinone (TQ), a chemical constituent of Cumin and
              Thyme essential oils, has been shown to promote cellular
              health in many previous research studies. This specific
              property of TQ is attributed to its ability to inhibit
              telomerase activity. Biophysicists from the United Arab
              Emirates recently published a new study elucidating the
              mechanism of how TQ interacts with telomeres.3 They found
              that TQ molecules intercalate into G-quadruplex complexes,
              which are the 4-stranded helical DNA structures that form
              at the telomeres. TQ’s presence at the quadruplex prevents
              the DNA from being accessed by the telomerase enzyme,
              inhibiting the lengthening of telomeres by telomerase.3
              The inhibitory activity of TQ on telomerase is exactly
              opposite of the activity of toxic pollutants like arsenic
              and benzene, which actually increase telomerase activity,
              resulting in longer telomeres in cultured cells. <br>
              <br>
              In contrast with the circular chromosomes found in
              bacteria, human and animal chromosomes are linear. One
              simple fact of mitosis is that every round of cell
              division is accompanied by a loss of a few DNA bases from
              both ends of the chromosome.1 Telomeres are repeats of
              meaningless DNA sequences that are found on the ends of
              chromosomes.1 Telomeres prevent the loss of important
              genes, even after repeated cell division, because they
              surround the DNA in the coding regions of the genome.
              During repeated cell division, the telomeres are slowly
              eaten away rather than the coding regions of DNA. However,
              once the telomeres are gone, a cell will die due to loss
              of important genetic material found in the genomic DNA.<br>
              &nbsp;<br>
              Telomerase is an enzyme that adds DNA repeats to the ends
              of the chromosomes, lengthening the telomeres. Telomerase
              activity is observed in stem cells and body cells during
              times of repeated cell division, like during embryogenesis
              and development. However, telomerase is generally
              deactivated in adult somatic cells, which should normally
              die after a few rounds of division. This might sound
              counterintuitive, but allowing old cells to die is
              actually beneficial because it makes it possible for newly
              differentiated cells to take their place. Thus,
              controlling telomerase activity is an important part of
              maintaining good health and quality of life while aging.<br>
              &nbsp;<br>
              Thymoquinone (TQ), a chemical constituent of Cumin and
              Thyme essential oils, has been shown to promote cellular
              health in many previous research studies. This specific
              property of TQ is attributed to its ability to inhibit
              telomerase activity. Biophysicists from the United Arab

              resulting in longer telomeres in cultured cells.4,5<br>
              <br>
              This discovery explains the protective effects of TQ on
              body tissues. It also supports other data from
              experimental studies suggesting that Cumin and Thyme
              essential oils work to promote healthy cellular function.*</font><b><font

              Wherever I look at US policy, foreign or domestic, I see
              only insanity, ignorance, and incompetence.<br>
              <br>
              Take the issue of tariffs, which is Trump’s mistaken
              approach to bringing the jobs back home. The tariff
              “solution” overlooks that offshored US production counts
              as imports when US firms bring their goods into the US to
              be marketed.<br>
              <br>
              The Chinese did not steal American jobs by selling below
              US cost.&nbsp; The jobs were taken to China by US global
              corporations, along with the technology and business
              know-how, for the sole reason of maximizing US corporate
              profits.&nbsp; Labor, made as productive as US labor by
              offshored US capital, technology, and business know-how,
              could be hired at much less cost in China and elsewhere in
              Asia due to the enormous excess supply of labor that
              overhangs Asian labor markets.&nbsp; The enormous cost
              savings went directly into US corporate profits, capital
              gains for shareholders, and bonuses for executives.&nbsp;
              Half and perhaps more of the “cheap goods” imported from
              China are the goods of American firms, such as Apple,
              Levi, Nike.&nbsp; They are products of US firms that are
              made in China for sale in the US.&nbsp; They are not
              “cheap Chinese goods.”&nbsp; Do you think an iPhone is
              cheap or a MacBookPro is cheap?<br>
              <br>
              The tariffs fall on American goods produced offshore by
              American firms for sale in America. For example, on May 13
              the office of the US Trade Representative (USTR) released
              a list of “Chinese” products subject to a 25% ad valorem
              duty.&nbsp; The list includes cell phones, footwear,
              textiles.&nbsp; Do the cell phone imports from China
              exclude Apple’s iPhone? Do the footwear imports from China
              exclude Nike’s shoes? Do the textiles exclude Levis?&nbsp;
              I have not seen any information that Trump’s tariffs are
              only for Chinese owned exports to US markets. <br>
              <br>
              &nbsp;The tariffs will reduce the profits of American
              overseas production exported to the US and raise prices to
              US consumers, who have already lost the incomes from the
              manufacturing jobs that American companies moved
              abroad.&nbsp; <br>
              <br>
              In other words, tariffs are not a solution....<br>

              The Rex Research Institute is an organization of doctors
              and scientists who were creating various types of medicine
              in an attempt to prolong life. Gradually, they changed
              their objective into trying to find a way to make humans
              immortal. Due to their continuous experiments on living
              things, their plans backfired and had instead created a
              dangerous virus, dubbed the Rex Virus. This caused humans
              to turn into the undead, the zombies. The zombies managed
              to escape from the lab, during Chaos chapter, and started
              infecting the others. This was also the place where
              Jennifer was captured and kept alive as a human
              experimental subject... <br>

              At Mach 5 (3,836 mph), a hypersonic vehicle enters a dense
              atmospheric layer, the ambient gas undergoes not only
              density change, but also a significant temperature
              increase. This physical-chemical reaction is associated
              with the flight speed is converted into heat and chemical
              energy, which is a considerable heat barrier that had
              researchers around the world scrambling for new materials
              that could withstand temperatures far higher than the
              melting point of metal.<br>
              <br>
              It seems that researchers in central China, studying
              hypersonic heat transfer, a subdivision of aerodynamics
              that studies gas motion laws, have developed a
              non-carbon-based heat-resistance material for hypersonic
              flight, according to the Global Times.<br>
              <br>
              The lead scientist, Fan Jinglian from Central South
              University in Central China's Hunan Province, developed a
              composite of ceramics and refractory metals that can
              endure hypersonic flight at Mach 5-20 within the
              atmosphere for several hours, or temperatures of about
              5,400 Fahrenheit.<br>
              <br>
              Jinglian said the composite of ceramics and refractory
              metals makes the new material far more superior to Western
              technologies that use "traditional refractory metals and
              carbon-carbon materials."<br>
              <br>
              She said the composite is like concrete cobble.<br>
              <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Think of the ceramics as the
              cobblestones, or the pellets, and the refractory metals
              are like the concrete. In high temperatures, the ceramics
              will act as pellets that pin the refractory metals, so
              they will not soften and deform."<br>
              <br>
              As a result, the material has a melting point higher than
              metal, but also important characteristics such as low
              density and high malleability, according to the Hunan
              Television report...<br>

                <br>
              </font></b><font color="#000000">Chinese scientists have
              developed a new heat-resistant material for hypersonic
              aircraft which can endure over 3,000 C from friction
              caused by a Mach 5-20 flight within the atmosphere.<br>
              <br>
              The lead scientist on the project said the material
              outperforms all similar foreign-made ones with its high
              melting point, low density and high malleability.<br>
              <br>
              The new material enables a hypersonic aircraft to fly at
              Mach 5-20 within the atmosphere for several hours, as the
              high heat resulting from the friction between the aircraft
              and the air reaches between 2,000 C to 3,000 C, a
              temperature normal metal would not be able to
              endure.&nbsp; <br>
              <br>
              Normal metals melt at around 1,500 C, but this new
              material can bear over 3,000 C for an extended period,
              state-owned Hunan Television reported recently.<br>
              <br>
              Unlike foreign technologies that use traditional
              refractory metals and carbon-carbon materials, the
              China-made new material is a composite of ceramics and
              refractory metals, Fan Jinglian, the lead scientist who
              developed the material and a professor at Central South
              University in Central China's Hunan Province, told the
              Global Times.<br>
              <br>
              The combination of ceramics and refractory metals makes
              the material far more efficient than foreign-made ones,
              and this technology is world-leading, Fan said.<br>
              <br>
              In a simple analogy, Fan likened her composite to concrete
              cobble. "Think of the ceramics as the cobblestones, or the
              pellets, and the refractory metals are like the concrete.
              In high temperatures, the ceramics will act as pellets
              that pin the refractory metals, so they will not soften
              and deform."<br>
              <br>
              As a result, the material not only has a high melting
              point, but also valuable characteristics such as low
              density and high malleability, according to the Hunan
              Television report.<br>
              <br>
              China launched a major hypersonic aircraft project in
              2009, and most Chinese scientists considered using
              carbon-carbon materials instead of metals back then.<br>
              <br>
              Fan was questioned for her proposal to use such a
              material, but she insisted on making a sample, which came
              into being in 2012 and showed great potential.<br>
              <br>
              As of March, the material has been used for products in a
              variety of fields including aviation, space exploration,
              shipbuilding and national defense, Hunan Television
              reported.<br>
              <br>
              Hypersonic aircraft is not the only area in which
              materials made of ceramics and refractory metals can
              shine, Fan said. Any field that involves extreme high
              temperature, such as engines, space rockets and nuclear
              reactors, will have a great demand for the material, Fan
              noted.<br>
              <br>
              China launched the Xingkong-2 waverider hypersonic flight
              vehicle via a rocket in a target range located in
              Northwest China in August 2018.<br>
              <br>
              On Tuesday, East China's Xiamen University launched the
              Jiageng-1 hypersonic aircraft with a double-waverider
              design.<br>
              <br>
              The test was part of the university's project to try to
              quintuple the current speed of civil aircraft to achieve
              global direct access within two hours, the Xinhua News
              Agency reported on Tuesday.<br>
              <br>
              It is unknown whether Fan's material was used in these two
              cases.<br>

              <br>
              For the last century, researchers have used what's called

              sing to their plants may not be altogether mad, says Joel
              Sternheimer, a French physicist and musician. Sternheimer
              writes melodies that allegedly help plants grow, and has
              recently applied for an international patent covering his
              method of music making. The tunes are not random melodies:
              he chooses each note to correspond to an amino acid in a
              protein, and the full tune corresponds to an entire
              protein. Sternheimer claims that when plants ‘hear’ the
              appropriate tune, they produce more of that protein. He
              also writes tunes that inhibit the synthesis of proteins.<br>
              <br>
              He claims to be able, using simple physics, to translate
              into audible vibrations of music the quantum vibrations
              that occur at the molecular level as a protein is being
              assembled from its constituent amino acids. ‘Each musical
              note is a multiple of original frequencies that occur when
              amino acids join the protein chain,’ explains Sternheimer.<br>
            </font><font color="#000000"><br>
              Playing the tune stimulates synthesis of its protein. ‘The
              length of a note corresponds to the real time it takes for
              each amino acid to come after the next,’ says Sternheimer,
              who studied quantum physics and mathematics at Princeton
              University in New Jersey.<br>
              <br>
              His patent includes melodies for cytochrome oxidase and
              cytochrome C, two proteins involved in respiration,
              troponin C, which regulates calcium uptake in muscles, and
              the tune for inhibiting chalcone synthase, an enzyme
              involved in making plant pigments.<br>
              <br>
              Sternheimer claims that in experiments, tomatoes exposed
              to his tunes grew two-and-a-half times as big as controls.
              Some were sweeter as well, he says. The tunes played
              included those for three tomato growth promoters,
              cytochrome C, and for thaumatin, a flavouring compound.
              ‘Six molecules were being played to the tomatoes for a
              total of three minutes a day,’ he says.<br>
              <br>
              He also claims to have stopped an infection of the
              tomatoes with a mosaic virus by playing tunes that
              inhibited enzymes vital to the virus.<br>
              <br>
              The tunes are very short, he says, and need only be played
              once. The one for cytochrome C, for example, lasts just 29
              seconds. ‘On average, you get four amino acids played per
              second,’ he says.<br>
              <br>
              Sternheimer warns scoffers to be careful tinkering with
              the tunes because they can affect people as well. ‘Don’t
              ask a musician to play them,’ he says. ‘You must be very
              careful.’ Sternheimer says that one of his musicians had
              difficulty breathing after playing the tune for cytochrome
              C too often.<br>
              <br>
              Sternheimer says that support for his methods is spreading
              ‘by word of mouth’. One admirer, he says, is a leading
              Swiss industrialist who paid <br>
              for the patent to be filed. The patent covers applications
              in agriculture, health care and the textiles </font><b><font

              cm) were glued together and provisions were made for
              electrical connections. Platinum wires were made to run
              beneath the tank between the glass slabs. The circuit was
              completed by adding water to the tank.<br>
              <br>
              It is a new method of pretreatment of legume seeds. The
              legumes such as green gram and pea seeds were selected for
              the experiment due to its fast growth and also its
              economic value. About 100 seeds were presoaked in water
              for 24 hours to soften the cells. They were then placed in
              the tank containing water. The cathode and anode were then
              connected. 240V alternate current was converted to 27V
              direct current and the final treatment was 10m Amp current
              for 1 hour.<br>
              <br>
              The seeds were then removed and tested for germination in
              soil. A control of non-treated seeds was placed
              simultaneously. The results found were interesting.
              Electrically treated seeds showed 100 per cent germination
              where as in control 95 per cent was observed. Further the
              amount of growth was 3 times as much as the control was.
              When tested for disease resistance, the treated seeds
              showed higher resistance. In treated seeds maximum root (5
              cm) and shoot length (9 cm) was observed than in control
              room (2 cm) and shoot (2 cm) after 10 days of germination.<br>

              ...With the release of Helm, that [ private server hassles
              ] has changed. Helm is a triangle-shaped personal server
              that can host email (on your own custom domain name),
              contacts, calendar, and a file server, and is about as
              easy to set up as a new smartphone. For being basically a
              sophisticated product for hosting your most private data —
              where there are many opportunities to screw up — Helm’s
              technical choices and business model are surprisingly
              well-thought-out. All you need is internet access at your
              home and an iPhone or Android phone to configure it.<br>
              <br>
              The biggest hurdle prospective users will face, I suspect,
              is the price: You have to drop $500 to buy Helm to get
              started, and then pay a $100 per year subscription to
              continue using its cloud gateway and encrypted backup

                Phosphorene nanoribbons<br>
              </font></b><font color="#000000">Some of the most famous
              scientific discoveries happened by accident. From Teflon
              and the microwave oven to penicillin, scientists trying to
              solve a problem sometimes find unexpected things. This is
              exactly how we created phosphorene nanoribbons - a
              material made from one of the universe's basic building
              blocks, but that has the potential to revolutionise a wide
              range of technologies.<br>
              <br>
              We'd been trying to separate layers of phosphorus crystals
              into two-dimensional sheets. Instead, our technique
              created tiny, tagliatelle-like ribbons one single atom
              thick and only 100 or so atoms across, but up to 100,000
              atoms long. We spent three years honing the production
              process, before announcing our findings.<br>
              <br>
              The two-dimensional ribbons have a number of remarkable
              properties. Their width to length ratio is similar to the
              cables that span the Golden Gate Bridge. Their incredibly
              uniform but manipulable width allows their properties,
              such as whether and how they conduct electricity, to be
              fine-tuned. They are also incredibly flexible, which means
              that they can follow the contours of any surfaces they're
              put on perfectly, and even be twisted.<br>
            </font><b><font color="#000000"><br>
                Transformative potential<br>
              </font></b><font color="#000000">More than 100 scientific
              papers predicted the transformative potential of these
              nanoribbons, should it be possible to create them, across
              a range of technologies - some as many as five years prior
              to the publishing of our discovery in Nature.<br>
              <br>
              Perhaps the most important of these is in the area of
              battery technology. The corrugated structure of
              phosphorene nanoribbons means that the charged ions that
              power batteries could soon move up to 1000 times faster
              than currently possible. This would mean a significant
              decrease in charging time, alongside an increase in
              capacity of approximately 50%. Such performance gains
              would provide massive boosts to the electric car and
              aircraft industries, and allow us to much better harness
              renewable energy to eliminate reliance on fossil fuels
              even on grey, calm days.<br>
              <br>
              It also means that in future, batteries could use sodium
              ions instead of lithium ions. Known lithium reserves may
              not be able to meet huge projected increases in battery
              demand, and extraction of the metal can be environmentally
              harmful. Sodium, by contrast, is abundant and cheap.<br>
              <br>
              The field of electronics may also be thankful for
              nanoribbons. Moore's law observes that computer processing
              power doubles every two years, but this rate is in danger
              of slowing down as the physical limits of materials are
              being fast approached. Using '2D' materials like ours
              could redefine these limits, allowing us to make
              ever-smaller and faster devices.<br>
              <br>
              The ribbons could solve another major roadblock in this
              area - how to electrically connect nanomaterials without
              creating large resistance (and therefore energy loss) at
              the joins. Several-layer thick versions of phosphorene
              nanoribbons can be seamlessly split into ribbons with
              different heights and electrical properties, circumventing
              the usual engineering requirements of connections. Thanks
              to this, high-efficiency solar cells could now be much
              closer to entering into reality.<br>
            </font><b><font color="#000000"><br>
              </font></b><font color="#000000">The phosphorene
              nanoribbons' flexibility and thermoelectric properties
              mean that they could also be embedded in wearable fabrics,
              and used to convert waste heat into useful electricity.
              For example, we could soon see thermoelectric t-shirts
              that function as heart and blood sugar level monitors, all
              powered by body heat alone.<br>
              <br>
              The technology could unlock the potential of hydrogen as
              an efficient and low-carbon fuel. The gas is abundantly
              available in water and only produces oxygen as a byproduct
              when extracted. However, finding a way to do this cheaply
              has thus far eluded scientists. Water molecules can be
              split through a process called photocatalysis, but the
              method requires a material that absorbs lots of light, and
              whose energy properties match up well with water.
              Nanoribbons are predicted to have exactly these qualities,
              as well as a high surface area that would maximise contact
              with water, making it a promising candidate to crack the
              hydrogen-production conundrum.<br>
              <br>
              Encouragingly, phosphorene nanoribbons have already
              navigated major obstacles on the route to
              commercialisation. Finding a scalable production method
              like ours takes years for most new materials, and some
              never see the light of day. Added to this, phosphorus is a
              relatively abundant and easily extracted material in the
              Earth's crust. And since our ribbons are already formed in
              liquids, inks or paints can easily be produced to
              manipulate them at scale using low-cost methods such as
              spray-coating or ink-jet printing.<br>
              <br>
              Producing these ribbons is however just the first step
              towards revolutionising the above technologies. Much
              research now needs to be carried out to test theoretical
              predictions, and investigate the extent to which the
              properties of the ribbons can be tailored for specific
              applications. As the 20-year plus journeys of Teflon,
              lithium batteries, and Velcro show us, the road from
              discovery to use can be long. But with society
              increasingly moving away from fossil fuels, we expect that
              road to soon be well-travelled.<br>

                Abstract</font></b><font color="#000000"><br>
              Phosphorene is a mono-elemental, two-dimensional (2D)
              substance with outstanding, highly directional properties
              and a bandgap that depends on the number of layers of the
              material. Nanoribbons, meanwhile, combine the flexibility
              and unidirectional properties of one-dimensional
              nanomaterials, the high surface area of 2D nanomaterials
              and the electron-confinement and edge effects of both. The
              structures of nanoribbons can thus lead to exceptional
              control over electronic band structure, the emergence of
              novel phenomena and unique architectures for applications.
              Phosphorene’s intrinsically anisotropic structure has
              motivated numerous theoretical calculations of phosphorene
              nanoribbons (PNRs), predicting extraordinary properties.
              So far, however, discrete PNRs have not been produced.
              Here we present a method for creating quantities of
              high-quality, individual PNRs by ionic scissoring of
              macroscopic black phosphorus crystals. This top–down
              process results in stable liquid dispersions of PNRs with
              typical widths of 4–50 nm, predominantly single-layer
              thickness, measured lengths of up to 75 µm and aspect
              ratios of up to 1,000. The nanoribbons are atomically flat
              single crystals, aligned exclusively in the zigzag
              crystallographic orientation. The ribbons have remarkably
              uniform widths along their entire lengths, and are
              extremely flexible. These properties—together with the
              ease of downstream manipulation via liquid-phase
              methods—should enable the search for predicted exotic
              states=, and an array of applications in which PNRs have
              been predicted to offer transformative advantages. These
              applications range from thermoelectric devices to
              high-capacity fast-charging batteries and integrated
              high-speed electronic circuits.<br>

              Maxwell's demon at nanoscale</b><br>
            <b>by University of Barcelona </b><br>
          </div>
          <br>
          Maxwell's demon is a machine proposed by James Clerk Maxwell
          in 1867. The hypothetical machine would use thermal
          fluctuations to obtain energy, apparently violating the second
          principle of thermodynamics. Now, researchers at the
          University of Barcelona have presented the first theoretical
          and experimental solution of a continuous version of Maxwell's
          demon in a single molecule system. The results, published in
          the journal Nature Physics, have applications in other fields,
          such as biological and quantum systems.<br>
          <br>
          "Despite its simplicity and the large amount of work in the
          field, this new variant of the classical Maxwell demon has
          remained unexplored until now," notes Fèlix Ritort, professor
          from the Department of Fundamental Physics of the UB. "In this
          study, we introduced a system able to extract large amounts of
          work arbitrarily per cycle through repeated measurements of
          the state of a system."<br>
          <br>
          <b>Finding the favourable moment</b><br>
          Waiting for such a propitious occasion to get benefits is the
          same behavioural pattern of a speculator waiting for the right
          moment in stock exchange, or a predator waiting for a prey to
          come near. "From a thermodynamics point of view, that certain
          intuitive aspect in trying to look for the right moment is
          what takes more energy. The answer is whether it is possible
          to get the same energy from the propitious moment than the
          inverted one in the searching process, i.e. through a
          thermodynamically reversible process," notes Marco Ribezzi,
          researcher at the UB and the School of Industrial Physics and
          Chemistry (ESPCI Paris/CNRS).<br>
          <br>
          "Our experiments demonstrate it is possible to find the right
          moment, and not very common at the same time, and to use it in
          a reversible way. These results show the underlying
          thermodynamic structure to a general problem that can find
          many applications, for instance, in the field of biology,"
          notes Ribezzi.<br>
          <br>
          According to the researchers, the new version of Maxwell's
          demon could have consequences in self-organization and
          selection processes that occur during biological evolution.
          For instance, this device could be relevant in the regulation
          of biological networks in generation, transmission and
          transduction of signals through cell membranes.<br>
          <br>
          The experimental testing has been conducted in a system of
          optical tweezers, which enables the manipulation of a molecule
          each time, in this case a DNA molecule. With the right force
          on this structure, it is possible to unfold it, but if the
          force is small enough, the unfolded state becomes rare, so it
          finds the precise moment it was looking for. When the molecule
          is in a rare state, it has more energy and it is possible to
          use it. "The rarer the episode, the harder for us to find it,
          but the more energy we can get from it," notes Ribezzi.<br>
          <br>
          "The astonishing complexity of the living matter could be seen
          as the result, over several evolutionary timescales, of a big
          process of energy extraction in proper environments to store
          big amounts of information that are hidden by noise and
          randomness," concludes Ritort, also member of the
          Bioengineering, Biomaterials and Nanomedicine Networking
          Biomedical Research Centre (CIBER-BBN). <br>

              Quantum Superposition of Possible Futures</b><br>
            <b>by Gu Mile</b><br>
          </div>
          <b><br>
          </b>Unlike classical particles, quantum particles can travel
          in abquantum superposition of different directions.<br>
          <br>
          Mile Gu, together with researchers from Griffith harnessed
          this phenomena to design quantum devices that can generate a
          quantum superposition of all possible futures.<br>
          <br>
          In the 2018 movie 'Avengers - Infinity War,' a scene featured
          Dr. Strange looking into 14 million possible futures to search
          for a single timeline in which the heroes would be victorious.<br>
          <br>
          Perhaps he would have had an easier time with help from a
          quantum computer. <br>
          <br>
          A team of researchers from Nanyang Technological University,
          Singapore (NTU Singapore) and Griffith University in Australia
          have constructed a prototype quantum device that can generate
          all possible futures in a simultaneous quantum superposition.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When we think about the future, we are
          confronted by a vast array of possibilities," explains
          Assistant Professor Mile Gu of NTU Singapore, who led
          development of the quantum algorithm that underpins the
          prototype.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "These possibilities grow exponentially as
          we go deeper into the future.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For instance, even if we have only two
          possibilities to choose from each minute, in less than half an
          hour there are 14 million possible futures.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In less than a day, the number exceeds the
          number of atoms in the universe."<br>
          <br>
          What he and his research group realized, however, was that a
          quantum computer can examine all possible futures by placing
          them in a quantum superposition - similar to Schrödinger's
          famous cat, which is simultaneously alive and dead.<br>
          <br>
          To realize this scheme, they joined forces with the
          experimental group led by Professor Geoff Pryde at Griffith
          University.<br>
          <br>
          Together, the team implemented a specially devised photonic
          quantum information processor in which the potential future
          outcomes of a decision process are represented by the
          locations of photons - quantum particles of light.<br>
          <br>
          They then demonstrated that the state of the quantum device
          was a superposition of multiple potential futures, weighted by
          their probability of occurrence.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The functioning of this device is inspired
          by the Nobel Laureate Richard Feynman," says Dr. Jayne
          Thompson, a member of the Singapore team.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When Feynman started studying quantum
          physics, he realized that when a particle travels from point A
          to point B, it does not necessarily follow a single path.
          Instead, it simultaneously transverses all possible paths
          connecting the points.<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our work extends this phenomenon and
          harnesses it for modeling statistical futures."<br>
          <br>
          The machine has already demonstrated one application -
          measuring how much our bias towards a specific choice in the
          present impacts the future.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Our approach is to synthesize a quantum
          superposition of all possible futures for each bias." explains
          Farzad Ghafari, a member of the experimental team.<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "By interfering these superpositions with
          each other, we can completely avoid looking at each possible
          future individually.<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, many current artificial
          intelligence (AI) algorithms learn by seeing how small changes
          in their behavior can lead to different future outcomes, so
          our techniques may enable quantum enhanced AIs to learn the
          effect of their actions much more efficiently."<br>
          <br>
          The team notes while their present prototype simulates at most
          16 futures simultaneously, the underlying quantum algorithm
          can in principle scale without bound.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is what makes the field so exciting,"
          says Pryde.<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It is very much reminiscent of classical
          computers in the 1960s. Just as few could imagine the many
          uses of classical computers in the 1960s, we are still very
          much in the dark about what quantum computers can do.<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each discovery of a new application
          provides further impetus for their technological development."<br>
          <br>

          Quantum-Enhanced Stochastic Simulation) is featured in a

              Find Anti-fertility Agent in UN Tetanus Vaccine</b><br>
          </div>
          <b><br>
          </b>According to LifeSiteNews, a Catholic publication, the
          Kenya Catholic Doctors Association is charging UNICEF and WHO
          with sterilizing millions of girls and women under cover of an
          anti-tetanus vaccination program sponsored by the Kenyan
          government.<br>
          <br>
          The Kenyan government denies there is anything wrong with the
          vaccine, and says it is perfectly safe.<br>
          <br>
          The Kenya Catholic Doctors Association, however, saw evidence
          to the contrary, and had six different samples of the tetanus
          vaccine from various locations around Kenya sent to an
          independent laboratory in South Africa for testing.<br>
          <br>
          The results confirmed their worst fears: all six samples
          tested positive for the HCG antigen.<br>
          <br>
          The HCG antigen is used in anti-fertility vaccines, but was
          found present in tetanus vaccines targeted to young girls and
          women of childbearing age. Dr. Ngare, spokesman for the Kenya
          Catholic Doctors Association, stated in a bulletin released
          November 4:<br>
          <br>
          “This proved right our worst fears; that this WHO campaign is
          not about eradicating neonatal tetanus but a well-coordinated
          forceful population control mass sterilization exercise using
          a proven fertility regulating vaccine. This evidence was
          presented to the Ministry of Health before the third round of
          immunization but was ignored.” <br>

          </b>How to account for Americans being the most anxious,

          nations? Do we not live in the world’s greatest democratic
          utopia where dreams come true?<br>
          <br>
          What if the dreaming part is actually driving us insane? What
          if we have engineered a society in which fantasy has so
          grotesquely over-run reality that coping with daily life is
          nearly impossible. What if an existence mediated by pixel
          screens large and small presents a virtual world more
          compelling than the real world and turns out to be a kind of
          contagious avoidance behavior — until reality is so fugitive

          You end up in a virtual world of advertising and agit-prop
          where manipulation is the primary driver of human activity.
          That is, a world where the idea of personal liberty (including
          any act of free thought) becomes a philosophical sick joke,
          whether you believe in the possibility of free will or not.
          You get a land full of college kids trained to think that
          coercion of others is the highest-and-best use of their time
          on earth — and that it represents “inclusion.” You get a news
          industry that makes its own reality, churning out narratives
          (i.e. constructed psychodramas) to excite numbed minds. You
          get politics that play out like a Deputy Dawg cartoon. You get
          a corporate tyranny of racketeering that herds spellbound
          citizens like so many sheep into chutes for shearing, not only
          of their money, but their autonomy, dignity, and finally their
          will to live.<br>

          Can a people recover from such an excursion into unreality?
          The USA’s sojourn into an alternative universe of the mind
          accelerated sharply after Wall Street nearly detonated the
          global financial system in 2008. That debacle was only one
          manifestation of an array of accumulating threats to the
          postmodern order, including the burdens of empire, onerous
          global debt, population overshoot, fracturing globalism,
          worries about energy, disruptive technologies, ecological
          havoc, and the specter of climate change — things that hurt to
          think about.<br>
          <br>
          The sense of gathering crisis persists. It is systemic and
          existential. It calls into question our ability to carry on
          “normal” life much farther into this century, and all the
          anxiety that attends it is so hard for the public to process
          that a dismaying number of citizens opt for suicide. There is
          no coherent consensus about what is happening and no coherent
          proposals to do anything about it. Bad ideas flourish in this
          nutrient medium of unresolved crisis. Lately, they dominate
          the scene on every side.<br>
          <br>
          A species of wishful thinking that resembles a primitive cargo
          cult grips the technocratic class, awaiting magical rescue
          remedies to extend the regime of Happy Motoring, consumerism,
          and suburbia that make up the crumbling armature of “normal”
          life in the USA. The political Right seeks to Make America
          Great Again, as though we might return to a 1962 heyday of
          industrial mass production by wishing hard enough. The Left
          seeks the equivalent of an extended childhood for all, lived
          out in a universal safe space, where all goods and services
          come magically free from a kindly parent-like government, and
          the sunny days are spent training unicorns to find rainbows.<br>
          <br>
          The decade-long “recovery” from the Great Financial Crisis of
          2008 amounted to ten years of fake-it-til-you-make-it — with
          the prospect nil of actually making it to something like
          economic and cultural soundness. Are we too far gone now? Some
          kind of shock therapy is surely in the offing, and probably in
          the form of a violent financial readjustment that will alter
          the terms of getting and spending so drastically as to topple
          the matrix of rackets that masquerades as the nation’s
          business.<br>
          <br>
          That financial shock has been coiling and coiling in the
          fantasyland that banking has become in the new zero interest
          rate regime where notions that pretend to be money get levered
          into new ways of destroying life on earth and the human
          project with it. At some cognitive level the people of this
          land sense what is coming and the wait for it is driving them
          crazy. Tom Petty was right: the waiting is the hardest part,
          and a hard way to learn that a virtual life is not an adequate
          substitute for an authentic one.<br>

          <b>Abstract<br>
          </b>Outbreaks of airborne infectious diseases such as measles
          or severe acute respiratory syndrome can cause significant
          public alarm. Where ventilation systems facilitate disease
          transmission to humans or animals, there exists a need for
          control measures that provide effective protection while
          imposing minimal pressure differential. In the present study,
          viral aerosols in an airstream were subjected to non-thermal
          plasma (NTP) exposure within a packed-bed dielectric barrier
          discharge reactor. Comparisons of plaque assays before and
          after NTP treatment found exponentially increasing
          inactivation of aerosolized MS2 phage with increasing applied
          voltage. At 30?kV and an air flow rate of 170 standard liters
          per minute, a greater than 2.3 log reduction of infective
          virus was achieved across the reactor. This reduction
          represented ~2 log of the MS2 inactivated and ~0.35 log
          physically removed in the packed bed. Increasing the air flow
          rate from 170 to 330 liters per minute did not significantly
          impact virus inactivation effectiveness. Activated
          carbon-based ozone filters greatly reduced residual ozone, in
          some cases down to background levels, while adding less than
          20 Pa pressure differential to the 45 Pa differential pressure
          across the packed bed at the flow rate of 170 standard liters
          per minute.<br>

          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Joe Tippens, of Oklahoma was diagnosed with
          late-stage small cell lung cancer in 2016<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By January 2017, it had spread throughout
          his body <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Joe's life expectancy was three months, but
          doctors enrolled him in a clinical trial that they hoped could
          give him up to a year longer<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A veterinarian suggested he try the dog
          de-worming drug, fenbendazole, which has shown cancer-fighting
          properties in cell studies <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By May 2017, all cancer had disappeared
          from Joe's scans <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, two years later, he is still cancer
          free and Oklahoma medical researchers plan to look into Joe's
          case<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WARNING: There have been no trials of
          fenbendazole for treating cancer, there may be risks involved
          and the medication is not recommended by doctors<br>
          <br>
          In January 2017, Joe Tippens was certain that he would die of
          small cell lung cancer. <br>
          <br>
          But then a veterinarian suggested he try something
          unconventional, to say the least: a drug for dogs.<br>
          <br>
          The medication, fenbendazole, is an anti-worm compound used to
          treat hookworms, roundworms and other gut parasites in
          animals, primarily dogs. <br>
          <br>
          In recent years, studies suggesting anti-worm drugs might have
          cancer-fighting properties have been cropping up in a growing
          number of journals. <br>
          <br>
          It's far from a proven treatment, but with three months to
          live and nothing to lose, Joe decided to take a chance on it.
          <br>
          <br>
          Joe was diagnosed with small cell lung cancer in 2016, turning
          his plans upside down, just two days before he was set to move
          to Switzerland from Oklahoma.&nbsp; <br>
          <br>
          He kept up a fighting attitude, but in January 2017, he got
          the news that no one is prepared to hear. <br>
          <br>
          The aggressive cancer was everywhere. It had spread to his
          liver, pancreas, bladder, stomach, neck and bones. <br>
          <br>
          His PET scan 'lit up like a Christmas tree,' he says on his
          website.<br>
          <br>
          At that late stage of small cell lung cancer, Joe's odds of
          survival were less than one percent, and the average life
          expectancy was three months. <br>
          <br>
          He had a trans-Atlantic move planned. He was expecting a
          grandson. And now everything had to come to a halt. <br>
          <br>
          Doctors at MD Anderson Cancer Center in Texas told him they
          wouldn't give up, and would put him in a clinical trial that
          wouldn't save Joe, but might give him a year or so to live. <br>
          <br>
          He might get to meet his grandson. <br>
          <br>
          'A year (or so) sounds a lot better than 3 months, so I said
          "let's go for it,"' Joe writes.&nbsp; <br>
          <br>
          Browsing an online forum for his alma mater, Oklahoma State
          University, Joe saw a post that caught his eye that same
          month: 'If you have cancer or know someone who does, give me a
          shout.' <br>
          <br>
          He did, and from the poster, a veterinarian, he learned that
          scientists had accidentally discovered that a dog de-worming
          drug seemed to combat many cancers in mice. <br>
          <br>
          The same scientist that had conducted that research, as it
          happened, had stage 4 brain cancer, and the same prognosis Joe
          had been given, according to the vet. <br>
          <br>
          She started popping the dog pills, and within six weeks, as
          the vet told it, the scientist's cancer was gone. <br>
          <br>
          Joe, who was 'a skeleton with skin hanging off of it' at half
          his previous weight, he told KOCO 5 News, placed an order of
          fenbendazole. <br>
          <br>
          His new dosage of dog pills cost just $5 a week. His insurance
          company had spent '$1.2 million on me with traditional means,'
          he said.<br>
          <br>
          According to a study published in Nature, the drug compound
          essentially starves cancer cells and kills them. <br>
          <br>
          It also is, of course, already in production, cheaper, and,
          according to cell studies and reports from people who have
          tried it, not very toxic, especially compared to chemo and
          immunotherapies.<br>
          <br>
          That said, it was a risk. <br>
          <br>
          Joe stayed in the clinical trial (he does not disclose what
          therapy he received) added vitamin E, CBD, bioavailable
          curcumin and, of course, the dog medicine. <br>
          <br>
          He didn't mention the de-worming drug to his doctors. <br>
          <br>
          In May, Joe's first grandchild, Luke, was born. Joe was there
          to meet him. <br>
          <br>
          Two-and-a-half weeks later, he had another PET scan. <br>
          <br>
          'Three months earlier...There was cancer in my body from head
          to toe. And it was a terrifyingly dangerous metastasis that
          leaves virtually 100% of its victims dead within 3 months.
          Here I was 3 months later and the PET scan was completely
          dark......void of any light.....anywhere,' Joe writes. <br>
          <br>
          He was dumbfounded. His oncologist was dumbfounded, according
          to Joe's account. <br>
          <br>
          Joe writes that his doctor told him, 'We don't quite know what
          to make of this as you are the only patient on the clinical
          trial with this kind of response.'<br>
          <br>
          In September 2017, Joe went for yet another scan, and was
          still cancer free. At last he told his doctor what he'd been
          doing outside the hospital. <br>
          <br>
          There was no way at that point to prove that it was the
          de-worming drug that vanished Joe's cancer, but his doctor did
          tell him that he was an 'outlier' of the trial, Joe writes. <br>
          <br>
          Joe's final scan was taken in January of 2018, and when he had
          a follow-up appointment that April, he writes that his
          oncologist kicked him out of the cancer center - because Joe
          had no cancer to treat. <br>
          <br>
          His results seem too-good-to-be true, but Joe claims to have
          collected over 40 examples of similar success stories. <br>
          <br>
          And his results were good enough to pique the interest of the
          president of the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation, Dr
          Stephen Prescott. <br>
          <br>
          'I'm usually skeptical, and I was and maybe still am about
          this one, but there's interesting background on this' he told
          KOCO. <br>
          <br>
          Now, Dr Prescott and Joe are working on a case study report,
          according to KOCO.&nbsp; <br>
          <br>
          Joe is careful to note that he's not a doctor, and is 'only
          one man with limited resources.' <br>
          <br>
          'I am not prescribing medicine and I am not qualified to give
          advice on medical treatments. <br>
          <br>
          BUT.....I am qualified to tell my story to as many people as
          possible.'&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>

          A study by North Carolina State University researchers finds
          that a new cookstove design, which makes use of compressed
          wood pellets, reduces air pollution by about 90% for a range
          of contaminants associated with health problems and climate
          change. The findings stem from a Rwanda field study designed
          to test the performance of the stoves in real-world
          conditions.<br>
          <br>
          "We wanted to evaluate these new, pellet-fueled stoves, and
          secured funding from the Clean Cooking Alliance and the
          Climate and Clean Air Coalition based on our experience
          conducting field evaluations," says Andy Grieshop, an
          associate professor of environmental engineering at NC State
          and corresponding author of a paper on the work.<br>
          <br>
          "There have been numerous attempts to develop cleaner
          cookstoves for use in developing countries, but while they've
          often done well in lab testing, they've had disappointing
          performance when tested in real-world conditions," Grieshop
          says. "However, we found that the pellet-fed stoves performed
          well in the field. We saw drastic cuts in pollutant
          emissions."<br>
          <br>
          The pellet-fueled stoves rely on battery-powered fans to burn
          the pellets efficiently, reducing pollutant emissions. The
          stoves come with solar panels for recharging the batteries,
          making long-term use feasible in areas where plugging a
          battery charger into the wall isn't an option.<br>
          <br>
          The researchers worked with residents in Rwanda, monitoring
          air emissions when people prepared food using conventional
          wood fires, which are common in rural areas; when using
          conventional charcoal-burning cookstoves, which are common in
          urban areas; and when using the new pellet-fueled cookstoves.<br>
          <br>
          The researchers tested for a range of air pollutants,
          including fine particulate matter (PM) and carbon
          monoxide—both of which pose health risks—and black carbon,
          which is a major contributor to climate change. A large
          fraction of global black carbon emissions comes from heating
          and cooking in homes.<br>
          <br>
          "For the most part, we saw pollutant levels across the board
          cut by 90% or more using the pellet-burning stoves," Grieshop
          says.<br>
          <br>
          For example, the researchers found that mean reduction in PM
          emissions from pellet-fueled stoves was 97% compared to wood
          fires and 89% compared to charcoal cookstoves. The
          pellet-fueled stoves are also the first cookstoves that have
          met the International Organization for Standardization's (ISO)
          highest standard—Tier 5—for carbon monoxide emissions. The
          stoves also met stringent emission rate targets for carbon
          monoxide set by the World Health Organization, though they
          fell slightly short of the PM emission target.<br>
          <br>
          "The ISO standard was developed with lab testing in mind, and
          we got these results in the field, which is remarkable,"
          Grieshop says.<br>
          <br>
          "The only exceptions we found to these emission cuts were when
          a pellet stove was used improperly," Grieshop says. "For
          example, when people used sticks or other materials to start
          the fire instead of kerosene, as suggested by the
          manufacturer, we found higher emissions in roughly 10% of the
          59 pellet stove research tests. But even the worst performance
          from a pellet stove was comparable to the best performance
          from a wood or charcoal cooking test."<br>
          <br>
          While these results are promising, the real challenge will be
          whether the pellet-fueled stove concept can be scaled up to
          meet the demands of millions or billions of people in low-
          income regions. Test results showing how effective the
          pellet-fueled stoves are at reducing air pollution are new,
          but the concept of introducing new cookstoves is not.<br>
          <br>
          "The stoves we tested are essentially provided for free by a
          company that makes money by selling the necessary wood fuel
          pellets," Grieshop says. "Anecdotally, we found in Rwanda that
          the cost of the pellets was comparable to the cost of the
          charcoal people buy for their cooking needs. However, right
          now, the fuel pellets are made using sawdust waste from timber
          operations. We just don't know to what extent that is
          scalable."<br>

          <b>Abstract</b><br>
          Nearly all households in Rwanda burn solid fuels for cooking.
          A private firm in Rwanda is distributing forced-draft
          pellet-fed semi-gasifier cookstoves and fuel pellets. We
          measured in-use emissions of pollutants including fine
          particulate matter (PM2.5), organic and elemental carbon (OC,
          EC), black carbon (BC) and carbon monoxide (CO) in 91
          uncontrolled cooking tests (UCTs) of both pellet and baseline
          (wood; charcoal) stoves. We observed &gt;90% reductions in
          most pollutant emission factors/rates from pellet stoves
          compared to baseline stoves. Pellet stoves performed far
          better than gasifier stoves burning unprocessed wood, and
          consistent with ISO tiers 4 and 5 for PM2.5 and CO,
          respectively. Pellet stoves were generally clean, but
          performance varied; emissions from the dirtiest pellet tests
          matched those from the cleanest traditional stove tests. Our
          real-time data suggest that events occurring during ignition
          and the end of testing (e.g., refueling, char burnout) drive
          high emissions during pellet tests. We use our data to
          estimate potential health and climate cobenefits from stove
          adoption. This analysis suggests that pellet stoves have the
          potential to provide health benefits far above previously
          tested biomass stoves and approaching modern fuel stoves
          (e.g., LPG). Net climate impacts of pellet stoves range from
          similar to LPG to negligible, depending on biomass source and
          upstream emissions.<b><br>
