            Colin McKay is an Australian born entrepreneur living in New
            South Wales. From 2010-2014 he blogged on finance,
            economics, and Australian politics and in 2010 he served as
            board member and bookkeeper for the Center for Economic
            Stability. In 2011 he presented his own concept for Deror,
            an alternate currency ecosystem where "everyone is their own
            central banker.” McKay blogs at Psalmistice.com and is
            presently writing a book tracing the foundations of
            double-entry accounting to ancient Semitic cults.<br>
            <br>
            Colin is with us to provide a detailed overview of his essay
            “The Money Shot: Even Banking Is All About Sex,” which
            presents the history and mechanisms of el modo vinegia (“the
            Venetian method”) of double-entry bookkeeping. He explains
            how this Hermetic-Kabbalist system for calculating debts
            that was formalized during the early Renaissance period has
            been used for deliberately concealing the immoral practice
            of usury in the banking system. Colin describes how the
            ancient Semitic worship of the androgynous goddess
            Inanna-Ishtar and the principle of the unity of opposites
            (male/female, order/disorder, creation/destruction), used in
            combination with trickery in the form of deceitful words, is
            the fundamental underlying concept of creating “money” out
            of nothing. He illustrates how this “magick” is represented
            by the Hermetic-Kabbalist alchemical symbol of the hexagram
            (Seal of Solomon) and breaks down the two-sided, sexual
            nature of the process at the heart of usury. Then, we
            discuss Professor Richard Werner’s investigations of the
            central banking system in Japan and his legal perspective of
            credit. Colin also talks about the practice of money lending
            within the Catholic church and the 14th century
            transformation of modern banking that occurred when the
            church adopted the Venetian method.<br>
            <br>
            In the members’ segment, Colin addresses the importance of
            understanding the mechanisms of the central banking system
            and the creation of credit by private banks. He explains how
            the predatory banking system’s core fraud revolves around
            the changing of labels that lead borrowers to mistake
            substance for form. Then, Colin introduces his alternate
            currency, Deror, an honor based system that can be
            understood by looking at ancient Cuneiform record keeping,
            which used a bartering system of IOUs overseen by central
            authorities such as temple priests. He lays out how the
            algorithm works on the concept of a triangular balance
            sheet, with credits on one side, debts on another, and an
            honor rating at the top, and he gives examples of the
            exchange as a social interaction based on trust. Colin says
            the idea behind this system is that everyone is able to be a
            “money god” with infinite potential to create money. Later,
            we look at the idea that Bitcoin shares similar problems
            with conventional money in that its worth is based in a
            value that can be increased through saving rather than
            spending. At the end, Colin illuminates the occult concept
            of expanding or lengthening balance sheets as a metaphor for
            the power of lenders over those they manipulate.<br>

            <br>
            This paper presents the first empirical evidence in the
            history of banking on the question of whether banks can
            create money out of nothing. The banking crisis has revived
            interest in this issue, but it had remained unsettled. Three
            hypotheses are recognised in the literature. According to
            the financial intermediation theory of banking, banks are
            merely intermediaries like other non-bank financial
            institutions, collecting deposits that are then lent out.
            According to the fractional reserve theory of banking,
            individual banks are mere financial intermediaries that
            cannot create money, but collectively they end up creating
            money through systemic interaction. A third theory maintains
            that each individual bank has the power to create money ‘out
            of nothing’ and does so when it extends credit (the credit
            creation theory of banking). The question which of the
            theories is correct has far-reaching implications for
            research and policy. Surprisingly, despite the longstanding
            controversy, until now no empirical study has tested the
            theories. This is the contribution of the present paper. An
            empirical test is conducted, whereby money is borrowed from
            a cooperating bank, while its internal records are being
            monitored, to establish whether in the process of making the
            loan available to the borrower, the bank transfers these
            funds from other accounts within or outside the bank, or
            whether they are newly created. This study establishes for
            the first time empirically that banks individually create
            money out of nothing. The money supply is created as ‘fairy
            dust’ produced by the banks individually, "out of thin
            air"….<br>
            <br>
            <b>5.2. The empirical evidence: credit creation theory
              supported</b><br>
            <br>
            The second contribution of this paper has been to report on
            the first empirical study testing the three main hypotheses.
            They have been successfully tested in a real world setting
            of borrowing from a bank and examining the actual internal
            bank accounting in an uncontrolled real world environment.<br>
            <br>
            It was examined whether in the process of making money
            available to the borrower the bank transfers these funds
            from other accounts (within or outside the bank). In the
            process of making loaned money available in the borrower's
            bank account, it was found that the bank did not transfer
            the money away from other internal or external accounts,
            resulting in a rejection of both the fractional reserve
            theory and the financial intermediation theory. Instead, it
            was found that the bank newly ‘invented’ the funds by
            crediting the borrower's account with a deposit, although no
            such deposit had taken place. This is in line with the
            claims of the credit creation theory.<br>
            <br>
            Thus it can now be said with confidence for the first time –
            possibly in the 5000 years' history of banking - that it has
            been empirically demonstrated that each individual bank
            creates credit and money out of nothing, when it extends
            what is called a ‘bank loan’. The bank does not loan any
            existing money, but instead creates new money. The money
            supply is created as ‘fairy dust’ produced by the banks out
            of thin air.32 The implications are far-reaching.<br>

            </b><b>Abstract</b><br>
            <br>
            There has been a largely unrecognized explosion of chronic
            disease in the US.&nbsp; More than 170 million Americans are
            currently suffering from diseases and conditions that can be
            vastly improved or even reversed by reducing levels of a
            single molecule called peroxynitrite. Elevated levels of
            peroxynitrite have been associated with more than 60 chronic
            diseases, yet can be controlled through moderate changes in
            lifestyle, reducing exposures to a few environmental toxins,
            improving diet plus introducing non-prescription
            supplementation. While thousands of scientists recognize the
            pivotal role of peroxynitrite in disease, few policy makers
            and physicians are aware of the opportunity they have to
            heal a nation suffering from chronic diseases. The annual
            economic burden of just forty fast-growing chronic diseases
            tracked in this paper is more than $2.5 trillion. With
            increased public awareness coupled with enlightened action
            this cost to society can be reduced to a fraction by simply
            implementing the knowledge we already have.<br>

            <br>
            These numbers came from a work carried out from 2002 to 2006
            by Richard Lynn, a British Professor of Psychology, and Tatu
            Vanhanen, a Finnish Professor of Political Science, who
            conducted IQ studies in more than 80 countries.<br>
            <br>
            Richard and Tatu argues that differences in national income
            are correlated with differences in the average national
            intelligence quotient (IQ). They further argue that
            differences in average national IQs constitute one important
            factor, but not the only one, contributing to differences in
            national wealth and rates of economic growth.<br>
            <br>
            These results are controversial and have caused much debate,
            they must be interpreted with extreme caution….<br>

            </b><small><b>Natural DHT Blockers: List of Herbs that
                Inhibit DHT</b><br>
            </small><br>
            It is known that the main antagonist in the fight against
            genetic hair loss is DHT. DHT is short for
            dihydrotestosterone. Therefore, the principal part of
            anyone’s hair loss prevention regime should be DHT blockers.
            The conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone and
            the hormones’ interactions within the human body is believed
            to not only shape the progression of balding, but also play
            a role in benign prostate hypertrophy (enlarged prostate)
            and even prostate cancer. There are many shampoos, vitamins,
            and ‘hair loss pills’ that are being sold these days with
            some pretty wild claims on their effectiveness in halting
            the conversion process of testosterone to DHT. The evidence
            is cloudy to say the least. It is still very much up to the
            individual to run their own trial and error.<br>
            <br>
            DHT-Blocker is a prevalent term used to describe a number of
            methods or products whose primary aim is to prevent DHT from
            miniaturizing the hair follicles. Eventually the hair
            follicle will become so damaged that it will lie dormant and
            stop growing hair altogether. Sometimes the term
            ‘DHT-Blocker’ is incorrectly used as marketing lingo or by
            those who simply do not understand the process. As such,
            ‘DHT-Blocker’ has become a term associated with any product
            that works through the following mechanisms:<br>
            <br>
            Lower baseline production of DHT<br>
            Inhibit global production of DHT, by reducing production of
            the enyzme 5 alpha reductase that converts into DHT<br>
            Prevent DHT from binding to the receptors in hair follicles<br>
            Reduce cholesterol, too much cholesterol can produce enyme 5
            alpha reductase which turns testosterone into DHT<br>
            Purify the scalp and remove any excess sebum and scalp DHT<br>
            <br>
            Saw palmetto is likely the most popular natural DHT blocker.
            A lot of evidence has been gathered showing its efficacy in
            preventing or slowing hair loss. It is a potent herbal DHT
            inhibitor and considered the best natural DHT blocker by
            many. Saw palmetto is approved in Europe as a treatment for
            hair loss. It is also widely used to keep men’s prostates
            healthy, just like the medication Finasteride. Propecia is
            the name brand of Finasteride. Both saw palmetto and
            Propecia are known to be&nbsp; 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors.
            Saw palmetto is tolerated very well by the majority who take
            it. Mild side effects such as upset stomach are sometimes
            experienced by users.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Ground Pygeum Bark</b><b><br>
            </b><br>
            Pygeum bark, or Pygeum Africanum is another herbal remedy
            that has been shown to alleviate unpleasant side effects of
            benign prostatic hyperplasia (enlarged prostate). Pygeum
            Africanum is thought to be a hormone balancer. It will aid
            the user in reducing and regulating levels of DHT. Like saw
            palmetto, it also partially blocks the action of 5 alpha
            reductase. Pygeum is known to block another enyzme called
            aromatase as well.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Pumpkin Seed</b><b><br>
            </b><br>
            Pumpkin seeds and the derived oil has been discovered to
            break down DHT via the liver. Eating raw pumpkin seeds was a
            method in the old days to prevent benign prostatic
            hyperplasia. In Germany, the regulatory agency that acts
            like the United States’ FDA is called the German E
            Commission. The E Commission has approved pumpkin seed oil
            for the treatment of prostate disorders. The Physicians’
            Desk Reference for Herbal Medicines believes the DHT
            blocking properties are thanks to the presence of rare amino
            acids such as cucurbitin and several plant steroids.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Stinging Nettle Root</b><b><br>
            </b><br>
            Stinging nettle is a botanical with a long history of human
            use. Like saw palmetto, stinging nettle is used widely in
            Europe to treat BPH. There was also a double blind study in
            2013 with 100 patients you can read about here. It is
            sometimes combined with pygeum bark and saw palmetto for a
            potent blend of DHT blockers. This herbal combination is
            found to effectively reduce prostate swelling. Since
            androgenetic alopecia is caused by a similar mechanism (DHT)
            as prostatic hyperplasia, this blend of herbs has been seen
            to be particularly effective at warding off hair loss.<br>
            <br>
            <b>β-Sitosterol</b><b><br>
            </b><br>
            Beta sitosterol is actually a mixture of phytersterols.
            These phytersterols have anti-androgenic properties, which
            are known to fight off DHT. Most plant species contain
            sterols, for example, even saw palmetto has sterols. Beta
            Sitosterol actually contains more sterols than saw palmetto.
            Beta sitosterol also lowers cholesterol levels which is
            associated with higher DHT levels. It is a completely
            organic product, and is not known to have any negative side
            effects.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Emu Oil</b><b><br>
            </b><br>
            100% natural emu oil contains a high concentration of
            linolenic acid. Some research has indicated that linolenic
            acid is a mild antiandrogen. It is sometimes used to treat
            acne and hirsuitism. While it may not be the best DHT
            blocker, many associate using emu oil with promoting new
            hair growth. The oil is not greasy and can be applied to the
            scalp at night.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Soy Beans</b><b><br>
            </b><br>
            Soy Isoflavones are extracted from soybeans. This is another
            natural DHT remedy that generally comes in tablet form.
            These isoflavones indirectly block DHT by regulating bad
            cholesterol. High levels of cholesterol can elevate
            production of enzyme 5 alpha reductase, which in turn
            converts testosterone into DHT. Consuming soy products have
            also been shown to regulate hormones, increase bone
            strength, promote cardiovascular health, and seen to have
            positive effects on the prostate. This is a good DHT blocker
            for women as it reduces the risk of breast cancer, prevents
            osteoporosis, and protects against uterine cancer.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Green Tea</b><b><br>
            </b><br>
            Some research has indicated that epigallocatechin 3 Gallate
            (EGCG), one of the active components of green tea, also
            blocks the formation of DHT. At Harvard Medical School, a
            team of scientists reported in an issue of The Journal of
            Nutrition that green tea had significantly decreased DHT and
            testosterone concentration in the blood. A more recent study
            was conducted by British researchers. This was published in
            a peer reviewed medical journal Cancer Prevention Research
            in 2009. It found that EGCG decreased cell proliferation in
            cancerous prostate cells by inhibiting DHT.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Giant Dodder Seed</b><b><br>
            </b><br>
            This is a botanical that has been shown to block DHT by
            inhibiting 5 alpha reductase. However, the documented
            success thus far is limited to cultured skin cells. Giant
            dodder has yet to be clinically studied on humans. The
            study, which was published in September of 2008 issue of the
            Journal of Cosmetic Dermatology, showed DHT conversion was
            prevented when giant dodder extract was added to skin cells
            taken from mice with testosterone induced alopecia.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Gotu Kola</b><b><br>
            </b><br>
            Known by the scientific community as centella asiatica, the
            gotu kola herb has been used in India, China, and Indonesia
            (particularly in Ayurveda and Brahmi medicine) to treat many
            conditions for thousands of years. It has been used for
            things from anti-aging to a cure for diabetes. One of its
            constituents, called asiaticoside, has been found to
            stimulate and repair hair, nails, and other connective
            tissues. A study that was published in March 2011 of the
            International Journal of Pharmacy and Pharmaceautical
            Sciences concluded that gotu kola extract increased hair
            length and density in rats. It is thought to improve blood
            circulation to the hair.While no definitive human studies
            have been completed, many herbal hair loss products will
            include this ingredient in their mix.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Muira Puama Root</b><b><br>
            </b><br>
            Known as ‘nature’s viagra’, this is a male tonic that
            increases libido and strengthens sexual function. It is
            sometimes called ‘potency wood” as it is found in bark in
            certain trees native to the Amazon rain forest. It has been
            used for a long time in South America for mainly impotency,
            but reducing hair loss and balding was found to be another
            helpful benefit.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Eleuthero Root</b><b><br>
            </b><br>
            Known formerly as Siberian Ginseng, Eleuthero is utilized in
            many healthy hair supplements. It is also known to reduce
            hormones that are related to stress. It is used as a herbal
            antioxidant in Russia and China, but also as a natural hair
            loss cure. To date, there is no clinical proof of its
            positive effects on preventing hair loss.<br>
            <br>
            <b>L-Lysine</b><b><br>
            </b><br>
            Some hair loss product manufacturers will promote L-Lysine
            as a DHT blocker. That is not the case. It has no
            androgenetic properties. However, researchers have found
            that those that supplement DHT inhibitors with L-Lysine get
            better results. It was used by patients taking Propecia and
            found to bolster their results when compared to the control
            group.<br>

            " All cement structures that have re-bar are subject to
            various electrical assaults from various sources such as
            high powered transmission lines and cell phone transmitters
            and consequently will suffer from accelerated corrosion.
            Simple theory is: Radio frequency radiation or magnetic
            fields will penetrate cement to some small degree and thus
            induce currents to flow and then the currents cause
            corrosion. Thus concrete structures within range of cell
            towers will crumble and fail much more quickly.<br>
            &nbsp;<br>
            Canada’s Hydro British Columbia power company is replacing
            10,000 failing concrete poles with wooden poles. A Quebec
            organic pig farmer’s barn structure is being adversely
            affected. Calgary’s Bow River railroad bridge has corroded
            more quickly. Lille, France, has had a disastrous water
            tower structural failure. An overpass in Quebec has fallen
            down. High-frequency electromagnetic fields also affect the
            surfaces of Canada’s Parliament."<br>

            enough to open the blood brain barrier which protects the

      <font color="#660000"><big><font color="#000000">There have been
            many questions about the countries forecast specially the
            one focusing on the United States of America (USA). They
            won't be answered one by one but below you can find some
            explanation, thoughts and reflections. We are going to keep
            this as short as possible.</font></big></font><br>
      <br>
      <font color="#660000"><big><font color="#000000">The majority of
            the economic and demographic data used in the making of the
            forecasts is widely available by institutions such as the
            CIA, IMF, UN, USG, etc. You can see the most relevant data
            at every single country's page. There is a tiny part of data
            coming from a variety of shadow sources such as Internet
            gurus, unsigned reports and others. But all these sources
            are from the internet and are of public domain for at least
            a minority. For example, several years ago Dagong, the
            Chinese ratings agency, published a report analyzing the
            physical economy of the States comparing it with those of
            China, Germany and Japan. The conclusion was that the US GDP
            was something between $5 to $10 trillion instead of $15
            trillion as officially reported by the USG. We assume that
            the official data, especially economic, released by
            governments is fake, cooked or distorted in some degree.
            Historically it is well known that the former Soviet Union
            was making up fake statistics years before its collapse.
            Western as well as other countries are making up their
            numbers today to conceal their real state of affairs. We are
            sure that many people out there can find government
            statistics in their own countries that by their own personal
            experience are hard to believe or are so optimistic that may
            belong to a different country.</font></big></font><br>
      <br>
      <font color="#660000"><big><font color="#000000">Despite the
            numeric data "quantity" there is a "quality" model which has
            not a direct translation into numeric data. The 2014 strain
            of Ebola has a death rate of 50-60% but try to imagine what
            would happen if there is a pandemic of Ebola with hundreds
            of thousands or millions infected with the virus. So far the
            few cases of Ebola-infected people have "enjoyed" intensive
            healthcare with anti-viral and breathing assistance but
            above all with abundant human support by Physicians and
            nurses. In a pandemic scenario that kind of healthcare won't
            be available for the overwhelming number of infected leading
            to a dramatic increase of the death rate due to the lack of
            proper healthcare. The "quality" factor is that the death
            rate could increase to 80-90% in a pandemic scenario from
            the stated 50-60% rate. The figure itself is not important
            what is relevant is the fact that the scenario can evolve
            beyond the initial conditions from a 50% death toll to more
            than 90%. By the way, no pandemic or nuclear war is included
            in the forecast.</font></big></font><br>
      <br>
      <font color="#660000"><big><font color="#000000">The key element
            to understand the process that the USA will enter in the
            upcoming decade is migration. In the past, specially in the
            20th century, the key factor that allowed the USA to rise to
            its colossus status was immigration with the benefits of a
            demographic expansion supporting the credit expansion and
            the brain drain from the rest of the world benefiting the
            States. The collapse of the Western financial system will
            wipe out the standard of living of its population while
            ending ponzi schemes such as the stock exchange and the
            pension funds. The population will be hit so badly by a full
            array of bubbles and ponzi schemes that the migration engine
            will start to work in reverse accelerating itself due to
            ripple effects thus leading to the demise of the States.
            This unseen situation for the States will develop itself in
            a cascade pattern with unprecedented and devastating effects
            for the economy. Jobs offshoring will surely end with many
            American Corporations relocating overseas thus becoming
            foreign Corporations!!!! We see a significant part of the
            American population migrating to Latin America and Asia
            while migration to Europe - suffering a similar illness -
            won't be relevant. Nevertheless the death toll will be
            horrible. Take into account that the Soviet Union's
            population was poorer than the Americans nowadays or even
            then. The ex-Soviets suffered during the following struggle
            in the 1990s with a significant death toll and the loss of
            national pride. Might we say "Twice the pride, double the
            fall"? Nope. The American standard of living is one of the
            highest, far more than double of the Soviets while having
            added a services economy that will be gone along with the
            financial system. When pensioners see their retirement
            disappear in front of their eyes and there are no servicing
            jobs you can imagine what is going to happen next. At least
            younger people can migrate. Never in human history were so
            many elders among the population. In past centuries people
            were lucky to get to their 30s or 40s. The American downfall
            is set to be far worse than the Soviet Union's one. A
            confluence of crisis with a devastating result.</font></big></font><br>
      <br>
      <font color="#660000"><big><font color="#000000">The Demographic
            crisis in the former Soviet Union countries has extended for
            over two decades, if we accept that it ended early in this
            decade (2010s). The demographic crisis will hit the World in
            the near future and is projected to last between three and
            eight decades more or less depending on technological
            breakthrough and environmental issues. The aftermath is more
            likely a frozen picture with the population numbers staying
            the same for a very, very long period of time. The countries
            forecast population numbers do reflect birth/deaths but also
            migratory movements. Many countries are going to increase
            their gross population due to immigration while their native
            population may shrink.</font></big></font><br>
      <br>
      <font color="#660000"><big><font color="#000000">Over the past two
            thousand years we have witnessed the Western civilization
            built around the Mediterranean Sea shifting to Northern
            Europe and then by the mid 20th century shifting to an
            Atlantic axis to finally get centered into the States in the
            past 30 years. The next move will see the civilization being
            centered in Asia with Russia and China on top. Historically
            a change in the economic paradigm has resulted in a death
            toll that is rarely highlighted by mainstream historians.
            When the transition from rural areas to large cities
            happened in Europe many people unable to accept the new
            paradigm killed themselves. They killed themselves by a
            psychological factor. This is not mainstream but it is true.
            A new crisis joins old, well known patterns with new ones.</font></big></font><br>

            Schmalfuss.....The reference is found in a book called
            'Chronica Majora', a summary of world history from biblical
            Creation to the year of the author's death.&nbsp;&nbsp; It
            was written by Matthew Paris (d.1259), a pious Christian
            monk, described by the church 'as an historian who holds the
            first place among English chroniclers'.&nbsp; From his
            quaint specimen of Abbey records, the erudite Monk explained
            how Mohammed started an 'impious religion':</font></big></font><br>

      <font color="#660000"><big><font color="#000000"> It is well known
            that Mohammed was once a cardinal, and became heretic
            because he failed to be elected pope.&nbsp; Also (later in
            life) having drunk to excess, he fell by the roadside, and
            in this condition was killed by swine.&nbsp; And for that
            reason, his followers abhor pork even unto this day.</font></big></font><br>

      <font color="#660000"><big><font color="#000000"> Monk Matthew
            Paris called Mohammed 'cardinal'; a term that today
            signifies councilors of the pope, and the origin of that
            category of priesthood reveals another area of censored
            information in Christian development.&nbsp; The 16th Century
            church said that 'the office of cardinal (incardinatus)
            first came into being in the 6th Century...its true origin
            to this day remains unanswered for in none of the Councils
            (records) do we find authority for the distinguishing
            features of the office'.&nbsp; However, the position of
            cardinal was created by special decree at a French synod in
            January 560 and that information is recorded church
            history.&nbsp; 'The Synods which were held during the sixth
            century were confined to France and Spain'....</font></big></font><br>
      <font color="#660000"><big><font color="#000000"> &nbsp;</font></big></font><br>
      <font color="#660000"><big><font color="#000000"> ...It was at one
            of those Synods that the 'creatio' of cardinals occurred and
            the deliberations involved in its manufacture were termed
            'frivolous' by the 19th Century church.&nbsp; At that
            gathering a group of seven old bishops 'of carnal nature'
            established for themselves a special office to protect their
            earthly privileges.&nbsp; Many bishops of the time 'were
            given up to worldliness and gain, and we hear of worse
            scandals' and the creation of a new hierarchal
            administrative body of churchmen was one of those
            disgraces.&nbsp; Under the guise of 'bearers of hidden
            knowledge' they generated a new upper level class of
            ecclesiastics that were sworn by oath never to reveal the
            true origins of Christianity outside their select
            group.&nbsp; Professional clergymen were now entering the
            church and to protect the knowledge of Constantine's
            deification of his descendants at Nicaea from reaching new
            priests, a directorial code of silence was developed by the
            Incardinatus.</font></big></font><br>

            were naive about the true Christian origins and the basis of
            their preaching was not revealed until they achieved and
            maintained the office of bishop.&nbsp; They were then
            eligible to enter the College of Cardinals, and after
            swearing a vow of secrecy, were enlightened as to the
            invented nature of the Christian deity.&nbsp; Mohammed had
            achieved the position of cardinal, knew the false essence of
            Christianity, and having being passed over for the top papal
            job at around the age of forty, departed and established his
            own religion." </font></big></font><br>

        <br>
        This is a brief video of pyrolytic (destructive) distillation in
        plant alchemy work as taught by the adept Isaac Hollandus.<br>
        <br>
        This alternate method of working in the plant kingdom was
        initially brought to my attention by the New Zealand alchemist
        Rubaphilos.<br>
        <br>
        I created a local working group last year (dubbed CORE group)
        and we did this process so that everyone in the group could see
        the ‘white fume’ and ‘red fume’ for themselves, instead of just
        listening to me rant about it excitedly in discussions and
        classes. Though the segments were filmed last fall, workload as
        well as moving and reconfiguring my life (yet again) delayed me
        by a few months from getting this short video compiled...<br>
        <br>
        This was nearly an 18-hour process with setup and breakdown, and
        about 15 hours of process itself. The results seen at the end
        are what Hollandus called the White Fume and Red Fume. Raymond
        Lully called these same materials the White Wine and Red Wine,
        and yet other alchemists called them Mercury and Sulphur, or
        sometimes White Mercury and Red Mercury. When watching the
        process, you can see how Hollandus’ terms represent how the
        materials appear before condensing and how Lully’s terms point
        to what the materials look like after condensing, thus an
        example of how alchemists referred to the same things but by
        differing names based on how things appear during different
        parts of a process.<br>
        <br>
        This process has to be done multiple times to begin to get
        enough total working materials to progress further in this
        particular work. Since each working of this first process takes
        15 to 18 hours every time (not considering actual cleaning of
        the equipment which adds more time), and needing really good
        ventilation or ability to work outside in a protected way (which
        I don’t have here at the moment), it will be some time before I
        can resume this particular process. I have plenty of Ens work
        and other alchemy work to make my time productive, but I just
        felt very strongly that this process should be seen at least
        once by those in my small working group while we are also
        focused on other processes. Additionally, when I give talks on
        alchemy, I discuss this process as a deeper aspect to what is
        traditionally taught in (Prima) plant work. Because it has
        become such a focal point in clarifying distinctions in
        differing versions of how prima work is currently taught, I
        think it is beneficial to be able to see it rather than just
        hear about it… so I’ve posted it live for anyone that wants to
        view it.<br>

        <br>
        Proponents of clean energy will soon have a new source to add to
        their existing array of solar, wind, and hydropower: osmotic
        power. Or more specifically, energy generated by a natural
        phenomenon occurring when fresh water comes into contact with
        seawater through a membrane.<br>
        <br>
        Researchers at EPFL's Laboratory of Nanoscale Biology have
        developed an osmotic power generation system that delivers
        never-before-seen yields. Their innovation lies in a three atoms
        thick membrane used to separate the two fluids. The results of
        their research have been published in Nature.<br>
        <br>
        The concept is fairly simple. A semipermeable membrane separates
        two fluids with different salt concentrations. Salt ions travel
        through the membrane until the salt concentrations in the two
        fluids reach equilibrium. That phenomenon is precisely osmosis.<br>
        <br>
        If the system is used with seawater and fresh water, salt ions
        in the seawater pass through the membrane into the fresh water
        until both fluids have the same salt concentration. And since an
        ion is simply an atom with an electrical charge, the movement of
        the salt ions can be harnessed to generate electricity.<br>
        <br>
        <b>A 3 atoms thick, selective membrane that does the job</b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        EPFL's system consists of two liquid-filled compartments
        separated by a thin membrane made of molybdenum disulfide. The
        membrane has a tiny hole, or nanopore, through which seawater
        ions pass into the fresh water until the two fluids' salt
        concentrations are equal. As the ions pass through the nanopore,
        their electrons are transferred to an electrode - which is what
        is used to generate an electric current.<br>
        <br>
        Thanks to its properties the membrane allows positively-charged
        ions to pass through, while pushing away most of the
        negatively-charged ones. That creates voltage between the two
        liquids as one builds up a positive charge and the other a
        negative charge. This voltage is what causes the current
        generated by the transfer of ions to flow.<br>
        <br>
        "We had to first fabricate and then investigate the optimal size
        of the nanopore. If it's too big, negative ions can pass through
        and the resulting voltage would be too low. If it's too small,
        not enough ions can pass through and the current would be too
        weak," said Jiandong Feng, lead author of the research.<br>
        <br>
        What sets EPFL's system apart is its membrane. In these types of
        systems, the current increases with a thinner membrane. And
        EPFL's membrane is just a few atoms thick. The material it is
        made of - molybdenum disulfide - is ideal for generating an
        osmotic current. "This is the first time a two-dimensional
        material has been used for this type of application," said
        Aleksandra Radenovic, head of the laboratory of Nanoscale
        Biology<br>
        <br>
        <b>Powering 50'000 energy-saving light bulbs with 1m2 membrane</b><br>
        <br>
        The potential of the new system is huge. According to their
        calculations, a 1m² membrane with 30% of its surface covered by
        nanopores should be able to produce 1MW of electricity - or
        enough to power 50,000 standard energy-saving light bulbs. And
        since molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) is easily found in nature or
        can be grown by chemical vapor deposition, the system could
        feasibly be ramped up for large-scale power generation. The
        major challenge in scaling-up this process is finding out how to
        make relatively uniform pores.<br>
        <br>
        Until now, researchers have worked on a membrane with a single
        nanopore, in order to understand precisely what was going on. ''
        From an engineering perspective, single nanopore system is ideal
        to further our fundamental understanding of membrane-based
        processes and provide useful information for industry-level
        commercialization'', said Jiandong Feng.<br>
        <br>
        The researchers were able to run a nanotransistor from the
        current generated by a single nanopore and thus demonstrated a
        self-powered nanosystem. Low-power single-layer MoS2 transistors
        were fabricated in collaboration with Andreas Kis' team at at
        EPFL, while molecular dynamics simulations were performed by
        collaborators at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign<br>
        <br>
        <b>Harnessing the potential of estuaries</b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        EPFL's research is part of a growing trend. For the past several
        years, scientists around the world have been developing systems
        that leverage osmotic power to create electricity. Pilot
        projects have sprung up in places such as Norway, the
        Netherlands, Japan, and the United States to generate energy at
        estuaries, where rivers flow into the sea. For now, the
        membranes used in most systems are organic and fragile, and
        deliver low yields. Some systems use the movement of water,
        rather than ions, to power turbines that in turn produce
        electricity.<br>
        <br>
        Once the systems become more robust, osmotic power could play a
        major role in the generation of renewable energy. While solar
        panels require adequate sunlight and wind turbines adequate
        wind, osmotic energy can be produced just about any time of day
        or night - provided there's an estuary nearby.<br>

        <br>
        To move the world toward sustainability, scientists are
        continuing to explore and improve ways to tap the vast power of
        sunlight to make fuels and generate electricity. Now they have
        come up with a brand-new way to use light—solar or artificial—to
        drive battery power safely. Their "photo battery," reported in
        ACS' The Journal of Physical Chemistry C, uses light and
        titanium nitride for the anode.<br>
        <br>
        Metal-ion batteries such as those based on lithium ions run most
        of our gadgets. But they take a long time to charge. They can
        also overheat and catch fire if they're defective or damaged.
        These problems are often related to the unstable material used
        for the anode, the negative side of the battery. Musthafa
        Ottakam Thotiyl and colleagues wanted to address these flaws in
        a unique way.<br>
        <br>
        The researchers developed a battery with a titanium nitride
        photoanode that is highly stable and thus far safer than
        conventional options. Under normal indoor lighting, it
        discharged electric current and recharged within 30 seconds
        without an external power source. The photo battery worked for
        more than 100 cycles and could power a light-emitting diode
        (known as an LED). Although not yet strong enough to run
        commercially available devices, the researchers say their design
        is a promising first step toward a more sustainable and safer
        battery technology.<br>

        </b><b>Abstract</b><br>
        <br>
        Here we show a surrogate strategy for power production, wherein
        light is used to actuate a discharge chemistry in the cathode of
        an aqueous rechargeable battery (ARB). The proposed photo
        battery consists of a titanium nitride photoanode, promising
        cathode material iron(III) hexacyanoferrate(II) as the battery
        active species and Na2S2O8 as the chemical charging agent. The
        photo battery delivered negligible capacity in the dark and the
        capacity shot up to 77.8 mAh/g when artificially shined light,
        confirming that the battery chemistry is light driven. In the
        ambient light, the device retained 72% of its artificial light
        discharge capacity with a stable cycling for more than 100
        cycles. Further, an unprecedented means for charging the battery
        rapidly is presented using Na2S2O8 and it revitalized the
        battery in 30 s without any external bias. This methodology of
        expending a photoanode extends to a battery that is free from
        dissolution of active materials, irreversible structural
        changes, spontaneous deinsertion reactions, and safety concerns
        commonly encountered in the state of the art anode materials in
        ARBs. Apart from bringing out a sustainable way for power
        production, this device opens up avenues for charging the
        battery in the likely events of electrical input unavailability,
        while solving the critcial issues of longer charging time and
        higher charging voltage.<br>

        <b>Summary</b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        Researchers working in Iceland say they have discovered a new
        way to trap the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide (CO2) deep
        underground: by changing it into rock. Results published this
        week in Science show that injecting CO2 into volcanic rocks
        known as basalt triggers a reaction that rapidly forms new
        carbonate minerals—potentially locking up the gas forever. Most
        other tests of carbon capture and storage (CCS) have taken place
        in sandstone formations. But sandstone is too chemically inert
        to foster CO2-trapping reactions, and scientists worry that gas
        injected into it could leak back into the atmosphere. Scientists
        say the new results could help solve some of the technical
        problems that have kept CCS projects from being commercially
        successful. But they say the main obstacle—high cost—is one that
        only changes in policy can overcome.<br>

        <br>
        Responding to political pressure and popular demand for a
        largely untested cancer drug, Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff
        signed into law today a measure that allows the renegade
        compound—synthetic phosphoethanolamine—to be produced and sold
        legally as a cancer therapy in Brazil.<br>
        <br>
        Scientists poured scorn on the decision, contending it puts
        patients at risk and undermines the authority of the Brazilian
        Health Surveillance Agency (the equivalent of the U.S. Food and
        Drug Administration) to regulate research and approval of new
        drugs based on internationally accepted safety and efficacy
        protocols. This was a “political decision inspired by a
        messianic surge of pseudoscience,” says Gustavo Fernandes,
        president of the Brazilian Society of Clinical Oncology in
        Brasília. “It was the worst possible way of dealing with this
        problem.”<br>
        <br>
        The “cancer pill” sparked a national debate last year after
        Brazilian media carried testimonials of patients claiming that
        it relieved symptoms or even cured their cancer. The compound
        was developed in the early 1990s by Gilberto Chierice, an
        analytical chemist at the University of São Paulo whose lab
        distributed it to patients free of charge for several years,
        without any regulatory approval or clinical oversight.<br>
        <br>
        Apart from a few studies in mouse models and in cell lines,
        there is no laboratory evidence that synthetic
        phosphoethanolamine works as a cancer drug. The university tried
        to shut down Chierice’s operation in June 2014, but since then
        more than 15,000 people sued the university, forcing it to
        continue providing them with the pills. Advocacy groups,
        meanwhile, pressured politicians and health authorities to
        legalize use of the compound as a cancer drug. Brazil’s congress
        passed a bill to do just that last month.<br>
        <br>
        Officials in the ministries of health, industry, and science
        advised Rousseff to veto the bill, according to O Estado de S.
        Paulo newspaper. But with Rousseff fighting for her political
        life—the congress is attempting to impeach her over allegations
        of fiscal improprieties—her executive office recommended signing
        the bill, sources say.<br>
        <br>
        The law authorizes production, prescription, and consumption of
        synthetic phosphoethanolamine as a cancer therapy
        “independently” of registration with the Brazilian Health
        Surveillance Agency. To acquire the pills, consumers must show
        medical proof that they have a malignant tumor and sign a
        consent form.<br>
        <br>
        Under the new law, the substance can only be produced and
        distributed by “licensed agents.” On 1 April, the University of
        São Paulo closed Chierice’s former research lab, which had until
        then been producing the pills under court orders. The only place
        the compound is currently being produced is a private lab
        contracted by the São Paulo state government to supply it for an
        upcoming clinical trial. The lab is preparing the pills
        according to a formula patented by Chierice and six colleagues;
        they claim their preparation is different from the synthetic
        phosphoethanolamine available on the international market as a
        dietary supplement.&nbsp; <br>
        <br>
        Late last year, the science ministry committed to spending
        nearly $3 million on preclinical studies of synthetic
        phosphoethanolamine. Initial results, made public last month,
        were not promising. According to the experiments, conducted at
        four academic and private labs, the pills produced by Chierice’s
        group contained only 30% synthetic phosphoethanolamine, and the
        substance failed to kill cancer cells. It doesn’t appear to be
        toxic.<br>
        <br>
        At a 5 April hearing in Brazil’s Federal Senate, Chierice
        charged that the government-sponsored studies are being done in
        “bad faith,” and stated that his group is obtaining clinical
        data from overseas. The University of São Paulo in 2015 lodged a
        complaint with the police accusing Chierice of “curandeirismo,”
        or illegally dispensing unproven medical treatments. A criminal
        investigation is underway, according to news reports. “Maybe
        [Chierice] was well intentioned, but he did a lot of wrongs,”
        Fernandes says.<br>
        <br>
        The new law may please desperate cancer patients, but it’s an
        unfortunate move, says biochemist Luiz Fernando Lima Reis,
        research director at Hospital Sírio-Libanês in São Paulo, where
        high-profile politicians have been treated for cancer, including
        Rousseff in 2009 and former President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva
        in 2011. “Decisions like this should be based on scientific
        evidence,” Reis says.<br>

        <br>
        ...What substance is this? It is the combination of a very
        common substance used in many hair shampoos, called
        monoethanolamine, and phosphoric acid, which is a food
        preservative. The combination of these two compounds produces a
        substance called phosphoethanolamine, which is a marker of
        differentiated cells, which are considered cancer cells.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;As it acts in the body? This substance ourselves
        manufacture within the long muscle cells and liver endoplasmic
        reticulum. So we can not call it natural product because it is
        synthesized, but your body already makes for the same purpose:
        to defend you at all times of your life cells that
        differentiate.<br>
        <br>
        In practice, this substance reinforces what we already have? How
        it acts in the cancer cell? First, it passes the digestive tract
        to the bloodstream, it goes to the liver and forms a reaction
        with the fatty acid. What is this fatty acid? It is the
        substance that is fed to the tumor. It tumor energy. And it goes
        along with this substance inside the cell. When she comes in,
        that cell is relatively still, ie the main organelle her, called
        mitochondria, is stopped. It forces the mitochondria to work and
        when it forces, it denounces to the immune system and the cell
        is settled, is called apoptosis…<br>
        <br>
        Is there any contraindications? The capsule has to be ingested
        before the person to do chemotherapy? There is no “before”
        because it does not work as an adjunct. If you blow the immune
        system of the person, the results are not good because the
        action of fosfoamina requires that the immune system is intact.
        If there is no chemotherapy which destroys the immune system,
        perfect, may be combined. You have an idea of ​​how many people
        have benefited from this substance in the last 20 years? Lately
        we made about 50,000 capsules per month. This equates to 60 each
        person, 800 people or close to a thousand people a month. Now
        how many people have benefited I am not able to say because many
        of them, who were terminally ill, are there, alive. So I can not
        say how many people were healed. You published this study in
        several scientific journals. How many in total? Today I suppose
        there are nine to ten work in the best oncology journals in the
        world, which are international journals, along with the staff of
        the [Institute] Butantan, and explain the fosfoamina mechanism
        of action<br>

        The hope in the therapeutic potential of phosphoethanolamine,
        the "cancer pill", suffered a new setback in tests sponsored by
        the federal government.<br>
        <br>
        Mice and rats with cancer that received doses of the substance
        had no improvement - the tumors in the animals' organisms
        continued to grow.<br>
        <br>
        Posted on the website of the Ministry of Science, Technology,
        Innovation and Communications (MCTIC, in its Portuguese
        acronym), the results add to other evidence that "phospho", as
        it is called, may not have a good performance against cancer.<br>
        <br>
        Until now, the only positive result was the indication that
        phosphoethanolamine would not be toxic even when ingested at
        relatively high concentrations.<br>
        <br>
        The data have been challenged by researchers who work with the
        substance, led by chemist Gilberto Chierice, a retired professor
        at the University of São Paulo.<br>
        <br>
        Chierice and colleagues as Durvanei Augusto Maria, of Butantan
        Institute, argued that the concentration of "phospho" used in
        the in vitro tests were much lower than those employed in their
        own studies, and that the individual's metabolism as a whole
        (and not single cells) would be necessary for the pill to work.<br>
        <br>
        The team published some studies showing anti-tumor effects of
        "phospho", both in vitro and in vivo (in live animals),
        involving different types of tumor.<br>
        <br>
        Folha tried to speak to the researchers that vouch for the
        benefits of phospho, but they did not answer until the
        conclusion of this edition. <br>

              unprecedented protection against UVA radiation</b><br>
            <br>
          </big></div>
        A new compound developed by University of Bath scientists in
        collaboration with King’s College London offers unprecedented
        protection against the harmful effects of UVA radiation in
        sunlight, which include photo-ageing, cell damage and cancer.<br>
        <br>
        Most sunscreens on the market protect well against solar UVB
        radiation but have limited effectiveness against UVA-induced
        damage, relying on the reflective properties of creams to defend
        against dangerous UVA rays.<br>
        <br>
        However this compound, called the ‘mitoiron claw’ by the team,
        offers strong protection within our cells precisely where the
        greatest damage from UVA occurs, and doesn’t interfere with rest
        of the cell.<br>
        <br>
        The researchers from the Department of Pharmacy and Pharmacology
        at University of Bath, working with colleagues at Kings College
        London, hope to see the mitoiron claw compound added to
        sunscreens and skin care products within 3-4 years.<br>
        <br>
        Free iron concentration is particularly high within
        mitochondria, the batteries of the cell, where it is needed for
        several vital functions. However upon exposure to UVA in
        sunlight, excess free iron acts as a catalyst for the production
        of toxic reactive oxygen species (ROS), damaging cell components
        such as DNA, fat and proteins thereby increasing the risk of
        cell death and cancer.<br>
        <br>
        However this custom-designed iron chelator (a molecule that
        binds to an iron atom like a claw) moves directly to
        mitochondria where it safely binds the excess free iron,
        preventing it from reacting upon exposure to UVA rays.<br>
        <br>
        Tests with human skin fibroblast cells exposed to UVA radiation
        equivalent to 140 min of uninterrupted sun exposure at sea
        level, showed cells treated with the mitoiron claw were
        completely protected against cell death. Untreated cells
        suffered significant cell death.<br>
        <br>
        The research is published in the Journal of Investigative
        Dermatology.<br>
        <br>
        Dr Charareh Pourzand, from the Department of Pharmacy and
        Pharmacology at the University of Bath, said: “The role of
        iron-mediated damage induced upon exposure of skin cells to UVA
        has been underestimated for many years. For efficient protection
        against UVA-induced iron damage of skin strong chelators are
        needed, but until now these risked toxic effects caused by
        non-targeted iron starvation of cells.<br>
        <br>
        “Our mitochondria-targeted compound provides a solution to this
        problem and can address an unmet need in the skincare and
        sunscreen fields. This mitoiron claw is a highly effective
        compound, offering unprecedented protection against UVA-induced
        mitochondrial damage.”<br>
        <br>
        Now that the protective effects of the compound have been
        demonstrated the team, Dr Charareh Pourzand and Dr Olivier
        Reelfs from University of Bath and Prof Robert Hider and Dr
        Vincenzo Abbate at Kings College London, plans further work to
        explore the potential of this new type of compound.<br>
        <br>
        This includes the possibility of developing therapies for
        diseases involving mitochondrial iron overload, such as
        Friedreich's ataxia.<br>

        Mitochondria are the principal destination for labile iron,
        making these organelles particularly susceptible to oxidative
        damage on exposure to ultraviolet A (UVA, 320–400 nm), the
        oxidizing component of sunlight. The labile iron-mediated
        oxidative damage caused by UVA to mitochondria leads to necrotic
        cell death via adenosine triphosphate depletion. Therefore,
        targeted removal of mitochondrial labile iron via highly
        specific tools from these organelles may be an effective
        approach to protect the skin cells against the harmful effects
        of UVA. In this work, we designed a mitochondria-targeted
        hexadentate (tricatechol-based) iron chelator linked to
        mitochondria-homing SS-like peptides. The photoprotective
        potential of this compound against UVA-induced oxidative damage
        and cell death was evaluated in cultured primary skin
        fibroblasts. Our results show that this compound provides
        unprecedented protection against UVA-induced mitochondrial
        damage, adenosine triphosphate depletion, and the ensuing
        necrotic cell death in skin fibroblasts, and this effect is
        fully related to its potent iron-chelating property in the
        organelle. This mitochondria-targeted iron chelator has
        therefore promising potential for skin photoprotection against
        the deleterious effects of the UVA component of sunlight.<br>

        excellent effects of resisting methicillin-resistant

        inhibited so that bacteria cannot normally grow. The
        3-hydroxy-4-pyridone high-molecular iron chelating agent cannot
        be absorbed by skin because of macro-molecule characteristics,

        The invention discloses a use of a 3-hydroxy-4-pyridone
        high-molecular iron chelating agent. The 3-hydroxy-4-pyridone
        high-molecular iron chelating agent has antibacterial effects
        and can be used as an antibacterial material. The
        3-hydroxy-4-pyridone high-molecular iron chelating agent has
        excellent effects of resisting methicillin-resistant
        staphylococcus aureus. According to a mechanism of cation
        simulative antibacterial peptide formation from tertiary amine
        or secondary amine positive ion structures in a high-molecular
        iron chelating agent, interaction between a positive charge area
        and a negative charge area on a cell membrane, and iron
        chelating effects of an iron chelating agent, the normal growth
        environment around bacteria is destroyed and bacterium growth is
        inhibited so that bacteria cannot normally grow. The
        3-hydroxy-4-pyridone high-molecular iron chelating agent cannot
        be absorbed by skin because of macro-molecule characteristics,
        does not produce toxic or side effects and can be used as an
        antibacterial material with dual antibiosis effects.<br>

        The milk crystals of the Pacific beetle cockroach are beautiful.
        Slice open an embryonic roach under a microscope, and the
        crystals spill out in a shower of nutrient-dense glitter.<br>
        <br>
        But the flavor of cockroach milk is nothing to write home about.
        Subramanian Ramaswamy, a biochemist at the Institute for Stem
        Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine in Bangalore, India, told
        The Washington Post as much early Tuesday. As a party dare —
        he’d lost a drinking competition — one of Ramaswamy’s colleagues
        once ate a sprinkling of the crystals.<br>
        <br>
        “He said it doesn’t taste like anything special,” Ramaswamy
        said.<br>
        <br>
        Most roaches lay eggs. Not the Pacific beetle cockroach. It
        gives birth to live young, sort of like humans if we kept babies
        by the dozen in fleshy organs called brood sacs. Also like
        humans, mother Pacific beetle cockroaches produce food for their
        offspring. The embryos dine on a liquid substance packed with
        fats, sugars and protein. You can think of this like cockroach
        milk.<br>
        <br>
        It gets weirder.<br>
        <br>
        Insect experts have long known that this cockroach species
        secreted liquid food. But they thought baby roaches simply
        digested the stuff. When Barbara Stay, a zoologist at the
        University of Iowa, first stumbled upon a cache of crystals
        tucked inside the embryos, scientists were stumped.<br>
        <br>
        “We didn’t believe these crystals were actually protein
        crystals,” Ramaswamy said.<br>
        <br>
        Close inspection of the crystals using X-rays proved otherwise.
        Experiments suggest that cockroach milk is among the most
        nutritious and highly caloric substances on the planet,
        according to research published recently in the journal for the
        International Union of Crystallography, IUCRJ. Pound-for-pound,
        cockroach milk crystals contain three times more energy than
        buffalo milk, according to the analysis by Ramaswamy and his
        colleagues. Buffaloes, he said, were the previous top contender
        for producing a protein with the most calories.<br>
        <br>
        “It’s a complete food,” Ramaswamy said of the roach crystals. In
        the brood sac, the embryos gulp down the liquid. There, the
        proteins turn to hard crystals in their guts. Nothing is wasted
        — “the mouth is open and the backside is closed,” as Ramaswamy
        described the embryos. Within the sac, the baby roaches rely on
        these concentrated nutrients to grow large with an alien speed.<br>
        <br>
        The discovery comes at a time when dairy milk is under
        increasing environmental scrutiny, as cow burps add to
        greenhouse gases.&nbsp; Alternatives like almond milk, too, have
        not always fared better; growing the nuts is a famously
        water-intensive process.<br>
        <br>
        So what about a roach drink? When asked if the energy-efficient
        cockroach crystals might end up in more human mouths, Ramaswamy
        described the potential as fantastic. “I could see them in
        protein drinks,” he said. Then he described the hurdles.<br>
        <br>
        Lacking nipples, cockroaches cannot be milked in the county fair
        sense. A cockroach-inspired thirst-quencher, if it ever existed,
        would more likely come via yeast, he said. Bioengineered yeast
        is already used in the food industry to produce synthetic
        sweeteners, for instance.<br>
        <br>
        Plus, the roach brand is bad for business.<br>
        <br>
        “I don’t think anyone is going to like it if you tell them, ‘We
        extracted crystals from a cockroach and that is going to be
        food,’ ” Ramaswamy said. Further examination of the crystals
        will also tell if the roach crystals are toxic to humans.<br>

        Macromolecular crystals for X-ray diffraction studies are
        typically grown in vitro from pure and homogeneous samples;
        however, there are examples of protein crystals that have been
        identified in vivo. Recent developments in micro-crystallography
        techniques and the advent of X-ray free-electron lasers have
        allowed the determination of several protein structures from
        crystals grown in cellulo. Here, an atomic resolution (1.2 Å)
        crystal structure is reported of heterogeneous milk proteins
        grown inside a living organism in their functional niche. These
        in vivo-grown crystals were isolated from the midgut of an
        embryo within the only known viviparous cockroach, Diploptera
        punctata. The milk proteins crystallized in space group P1, and
        a structure was determined by anomalous dispersion from the
        native S atoms. The data revealed glycosylated proteins that
        adopt a lipocalin fold, bind lipids and organize to form a
        tightly packed crystalline lattice. A single crystal is
        estimated to contain more than three times the energy of an
        equivalent mass of dairy milk. This unique storage form of
        nourishment for developing embryos allows access to a constant
        supply of complete nutrients. Notably, the crystalline
        cockroach-milk proteins are highly heterogeneous with respect to
        amino-acid sequence, glycosylation and bound fatty-acid
        composition. These data present a unique example of protein
        heterogeneity within a single in vivo-grown crystal of a natural
        protein in its native environment at atomic resolution.<br>

        good? Well, you've come to the right article! Included here are
        many ideas which could help you with your plight. Read on to
        find out what you can do to fix the problem - home remedies for
        cockroaches.<br>
        <br>
        How to Kill Cockroaches: Before you decide to rid your home of
        pests you should consider the moral implications. For example,
        if you have a mouse problem you may want a method that just
        removes them, but does not kill them. These days most
        exterminators offer this to their customers, but it may be
        somewhat more expensive - killing cockroaches.<br>
        <br>
        How to Kill Roaches: Mix equal parts of sugar and borax together
        for an all natural pest control. Place the concoction into a
        glass jar &amp; punch holes in the lid for a reusable container.
        Sprinkle the all-natural product along the outside of your
        house. Ants will be attracted to the concoction &amp; will carry
        it back to their nest effectively ridding your home of ants -
        best way to get rid of cockroaches.<br>
        <br>
        Best Way to Get Rid of Roaches: If you are having a pest control
        problem at your home, take a look at your garbage for clues to
        why this is happening. Garbage needs to be in air tight bags and
        disposed of on a regular basis. Keep your trash outside your
        home and not inside your kitchen to reduce the chances of having
        a pest problem - how to get rid of cockroaches naturally.<br>
        <br>
        Home Remedies for Roaches: Make sure that when you install your
        windows, they come equipped with screens for protection. Screens
        can serve as a very strong line of defense for bugs, as most
        will not get into your home if you have a good screen up. This
        small investment can save a lot of trouble in the future - how
        to get rid of german cockroaches.<br>
        <br>
        How to Get Rid of German Roaches: If you have any leaky pipes or
        anything that drips water, make sure that you get them repaired.
        Leaving water around is a good way of keeping pests in your
        home. They will not want to leave because you are giving them a
        way to get the water that they need - how to prevent
        cockroaches.<br>
        <br>
        How to Get Rid of Roaches Fast: Are their cockroaches in your
        home? The best way to kill these creatures is to sprinkle borax
        in places where cockroaches hide. Put all your food away &amp;
        leave a few scraps to attract the cockroaches to a certain area
        sprinkled with borax, such as a cupboard or a crack where they
        hide - how do you get rid of roaches.<br>
        <br>
        How to Get Rid of Roaches Naturally: Go through the foundation
        and roof of your house to ensure that there are no cracks or
        holes that pests can get into. If you find any, make sure you
        seal them up as soon as possible. Try to avoid using typical
        caulk as they usually can chew through this. Your best bet is to
        use something made with copper or mesh - home remedies to get
        rid of roaches.<br>
        <br>
        Best Way to Kill Roaches: Did you see rodents in your home? Look
        over your home for cracks these rodents can fit through. Use
        steel wool to fill the holes &amp; put some poison out. Mustard
        oil may work as well - home remedy for roaches.<br>
        <br>
        How to Kill German Roaches: Sometimes calling a professional
        exterminator is a necessity. While many do it yourself, remedies
        work wonderfully, infestations can reach beyond the control of
        your average house owner. While it may be more expensive to call
        in a professional or service, it is definitely worth it to
        effectively rid your home of pests - killing roaches.<br>
        <br>
        How to Get Rid of Roaches for Good: You should under no
        circumstances tolerate pest into your home. If you do not take
        action right away, the situation will get worse. An
        pest-infested home will lose its value, the pest will damage the
        home &amp; some pest can actually transmit diseases to pets
        &amp; in some cases to humans - how do you get rid of
        cockroaches.<br>
        <br>
        Kill Cockroaches: Use peanut butter in your mousetrap. Many
        people follow the old tradition of using a piece of cheese, but
        the truth is that is does not works nearly as good as peanut
        butter does. Cheese goes stale &amp; does not have nearly as
        strong of an odor. Use peanut butter &amp; see how much faster
        it is to get rid of the rodent - how to get rid of cockroaches

        The organized Democrats - the Democratic National Committee -
        have shown themselves to be even more venal and corrupt than the
        Republicans. Leaked emails document that the Democratic National
        Committee conspired with the Hillary campaign in order to steal
        the nomination from Bernie Sanders. It is clear that Sanders was
        the choice of Democratic Party voters for president, but the
        nomination was stolen from him by vote fraud and dirty tricks.<br>
        <br>
        The DNC and the media whores have tried to discredit the
        incriminating emails by alleging that the leaked emails resulted
        from a plot by Russia's President Vladimir Putin in behalf of
        "Putin's American agent," Donald Trump. "A vote for Trump is a
        vote for Putin," as the presstitute scum put it.<br>
        <br>
        This diversionary tactic has not worked. Not even Americans are
        stupid enough to fall for it.<br>
        <br>
        Consequently, the corrupt "leader" of the DNC had to resign and
        was unable to deliver her speech at the nominating convention
        from fear of being booed off the stage.<br>
        <br>
        Sanders' supporters have abandoned Hillary and the fake
        "Democratic Party." Probably most of them will vote for the
        Green Party candidate.<br>
        <br>
        The organized Republicans - the Republican National Committee -
        and the zionist neoconservatives wanted to block Donald Trump
        from the nomination just as the DNC blocked Sanders, but could
        not. The neoconservatives are organizing for Hillary as she is
        their warmonger and Trump says he is not, but as the
        Presidential contest is really a contest between the two
        Republican parties about which gets to be the whore for the One
        Percent, the RNC, impressed with Hillary's lack of voter
        support, seems to be sticking with Trump. Better to be a
        well-paid whore than to be out in the cold.<br>
        <br>
        In the coming presidential election, the outcome will probably
        be determined by whether the powerful oligarchic interest groups
        decide whether Trump is an actual threat or whether they can
        cosy up to him and rope him in by appointing his government.<br>
        <br>
        Trump's disability is that no matter how able an individual is,
        that person cannot simultaneously make themselves a
        multi-billionaire and be knowledgeable of economic and foreign
        policy issues. The bald fact is that Trump, if he becomes
        president, does not know whom to appoint in order to have the
        support from his government to effect the changes for which his
        supporters hope he stands.<br>
        <br>
        When a person becomes President, that person doesn't suddenly
        become an encyclopedia with full knowledge. The President is
        dependent on the information flows from his government. If those
        information flows support the interests of Wall Street, the
        corrupt "banks too big to fail," the military-security complex,
        the Israel Lobby, agribusiness, and the extractive industries
        (energy, mining, timber), the President's decisions will support
        these material interests.<br>
        <br>
        Donald Trump is the American people's choice, because he is
        opposed to the offshoring of American jobs - a corporate
        practice that has enriched the One Percent at the expense of the
        American middle class.<br>
        <br>
        Donald Trump is the American people's choice, because he opposes
        the fabricated, gratuitous conflict with Russia. Even Americans
        understand that taking war to a major nuclear power will not end
        well.<br>
        <br>
        Donald Trump is the American people's choice because he realizes
        that NATO - an organization whose purpose disappeared 25 years
        ago when the Soviet Union collapsed as a result of the coup
        against Gorbachev by extreme elements of the Soviet Communist
        Party - now serves as a vehicle and cover for Washington's
        aggressions, which are war crimes under the international
        statutes that Washington created. Washington's wars benefit some
        of the One Percent at the expense of both the 99 Percent and
        millions of innocent peoples in many countries.<br>
        <br>
        What will happen now is that the presstitutes will demonize
        Donald Trump even more than they have demonized Vladimir Putin.
        The scum presstitutes will do everything that they can possibly
        do to make a vote for Trump into an act of treason against
        America.<br>
        <br>
        Now that the presstitutes have learned that they can tell the
        most blatant lies - Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass
        destruction, Iranian nukes, Assad's use of chemical weapons,
        Russian invasions - without being held accountable, they know
        that they can lie about Trump.<br>
        <br>
        And they will. To the hilt.<br>
        <br>
        But the presstitutes have lost credibility. A person has to be
        an imbecile to believe a word that they say.<br>
        <br>
        "Progressives" will wander off the track. They will be turned
        off by Trump's stand on immigration, which is where the American
        people stand. "Progressives" will be worried about whether the
        'fascist" Trump will persecute transgender and homosexual people
        or revoke the right of women to abort the unborn. To
        "progressives" this will seem all important as Washington and
        its NATO vassals hurl the world into nuclear war.<br>
        <br>
        Neither can any intelligence be expected from the defunct
        American left-wing. The American left-wing supports the official
        story of 9/11, the excuse for the last 15 years of illegal wars
        and the American Police State. To find the American left-wing
        totally allied with the official explanation of what is in
        reality a false flag event, committed in order that the
        neoconservatives would have their new Pearl Harbor in order to
        invade the Middle East, is demonstrable proof that the American
        left-wing is irrelevant.<br>
        <br>
        The American left interprets 9/11 and subsequent false flag
        events as oppressed peoples striking back at their oppressors.
        The emotional satisfaction of this takes the impotent American
        left-wing out not only of action but of relevance in commentary.
        The American left-wing has become an asset of the enemy - the
        neoconservatives who control policy in Washington.<br>
        <br>
        So, where do we stand? The answer is that we are closer to
        nuclear annihilation than ever before. I know of what I speak. I
        held the highest security clearances. I was a member of a secret
        committee that enabled President Reagan to end the Cold War.<br>
        <br>
        The President of Russia, Vladimir Putin is doing everything he
        can possibly do to avoid the nuclear war that the crazed
        American neoconservatives are bringing to humanity. For his
        efforts in behalf of planet Earth he is demonized 24 hours a
        day, seven days a week, year after year. For simply stating
        facts, I am described by the presstitutes as "an apologist for
        Putin."<br>
        <br>
        The endless lies about Russia have convinced the Russian media
        that Washington is mobilizing its NATO vassals for an attack on
        Russia. Read the transcripts to this Russian media broadcast.
        https://vimeo.com/174777588<br>
        <br>
        If you aren't scared after absorbing this Russian news
        broadcast, you are stupid beyond belief. The message is clear:
        the West has declared war on Russia but is trying to keep Russia
        off guard by denying it.<br>
        <br>
        The video of the Russian news broadcast also shows the
        dismissive way the Russian media was treated at the recent NATO
        conference in Poland. The non-entity representatives of the
        non-entity countries of Latvia, which has been ruthlessly looted
        by the West, Estonia, Lithuania, and Poland, and the Ukraine
        representative either refuse to speak to the Russian media or
        use the interview to repeat Washington's false accusations
        against Russia. These imbeciles insulting Russia are
        representatives of countries that Russia could destroy in a few
        minutes. If these idiots think Washington could save them, they
        are as stupid as the Polish colonels who thought that the
        British guarantee in March 1939 meant anything and could save
        Poland from the rash action of sticking Poland's fingers in
        Hitler's eye. This Polish stupidity provoked by the stupid
        British set off World War II with the British and French
        declaration of war against Germany, thus consigning Poland to
        Soviet rule for a half century. Some guarantee! The imbecile
        Chamberlain who wanted peace started WWII with Britain's
        worthless "guarantee."<br>
        <br>
        Does it make you feel safe that the arrogant warmongering
        imbeciles in Washington have convinced a nuclear power the equal
        of the United States that America is going to attack?<br>
        <br>
        Moreover, Russia is a nuclear power allied with another nuclear
        power, China, which has had enough of Washington's imbecilic
        provocations. Are you willing for "your" government to lead your
        future into nuclear war with two nuclear powers?<br>
        <br>
        Here we Americans are going into a presidential election and the
        overpowering fact of our time - that Washington is threatening
        humanity with nuclear war - is not a subject for discussion!
        What is the matter with us Americans? Are we stupid beyond all
        belief? We sit stupidly, thinking that issues of no importance
        are the most important issues of our time while "our" insane
        government provokes nuclear war. Have any people in history
        failed their obligation to this extent? If so, who?<br>
        <br>
        My case rests. There is no countervailing evidence against the
        fact that unadulterated evil rules the West and is driving the
        world to extinction. Western democracy is a total failure.
        Democracy could not prevent the crazed warmonger Hillary from
        presidential nomination despite the opposition of the American
        people.<br>
        <br>
        How long can Russia, and China, wait before they conclude that
        they have to pre-empt the coming attack from Washington? Does
        anyone, even stupid Americans, think that once Russia and China
        are convinced that they are targets for attack that they will
        just sit there and await the attack?<br>
        <br>
        Do peoples as guilty of dereliction of duty as Western peoples
        are have any right to survive? <br>

        There are different types of ports on the cells in the body, and

        <br>
        The form of vitamin C disclosed in the video and on the web site
        is absorbed through the glucose ports on the cells, and there
        are 4-5 times more glucose ports than ascorbic acid/vitamin C
        ports in the cells, so much higher absorption rates are achieved
        with this form (it also takes energy to absorb vitamin C through
        the vitamin C ports, but it doesn't take energy to absorb
        through the glucose ports). (Absorption into blood stream from
        digestive tract and from blood stream into cells in the

        <div align="center"><big><b>Taking the cow piss out of our
              waterways</b><br>
          </big></div>
        <br>
        Fresh Scientist ‘People’s Award’ winner finds how to stop cow
        urine running off our paddocks into rivers and creeks<br>
        <br>
        If carbon is added to paddocks where cows urinate it can reduce
        the runoff of nitrogen into waterways meaning more nutrients for
        pasture growth and cleaner creeks and rivers.<br>
        <br>
        This research finding is a win for both the farmers and the
        environment and was published in the international Journal of
        Environmental Management earlier this month by Griffith
        University PhD student, Amanda Neilen.<br>
        <br>
        Amanda is one of ten 2016 Queensland Fresh Science finalists and
        her one minute explanation of her research won her the “People’s
        Award” at a public event in Brisbane last week.<br>
        <br>
        “Cow’s urine is high in nitrogen and this can accumulate in the
        soil and then leach or wash off into waterways,” she says.<br>
        <br>
        High levels of nitrogen in our waterways cause the algal blooms
        that can choke the life out a river or smother a reef. Loss of
        nitrogen from farm paddocks means there are also fewer nutrients
        available for plant and animal growth.<br>
        <br>
        Amanda’s research discovered that grass-covered soil was three
        times less likely to have nitrogen runoff compared to bare soil.<br>
        <br>
        Every time cows urinate they can release up to two litres of
        nutrient-rich fluid. But much of this fluid can be lost from the
        soil and plants, especially during the high summer rainfall that
        southeast Queensland experiences.<br>
        <br>
        “I looked at how to keep the nutrients from cow urine in the
        soil so it was available to the grass and then the cows,” says
        Amanda.<br>
        <br>
        For her experiment, Amanda collected fresh urine from dairy cows
        at Maleny Dairies in the Sunshine Coast hinterland, north of
        Brisbane.<br>
        <br>
        “I investigated the three pathways that cow’s urine can take
        when it hits the ground. It can stick to the soil, get sucked up
        by the grass or eaten by soil microbes.<br>
        <br>
        “I found that by adding carbon to the soil it stimulated the
        activity of the soil microbes and stopped the nitrogen from
        leaching away.<br>
        <br>
        “Adding carbon to the nitrogen from urine is like adding the hot
        chips to the tomato sauce. It makes the nitrogen more appealing
        for the soil microbes to work on.”<br>
        <br>
        Having more nitrogen available in the soil means more grass.
        This means a farmer can carry more cows in each paddock.<br>
        <br>
        For Maleny dairy farmer, Sonya Hooper, this sort of research is
        very important for keeping their cows productive and their
        waterways clean.<br>
        <br>
        “We want to get as much grass feed as we can for our cows,” she
        says. “We also want clean water in our creeks as we use that
        water in our watering troughs and in the dairy.”<br>
        <br>
        Sonya works with the Lake Baroon Catchment Care Group to fence
        waterways on her property and to construct cow paths and bridges
        over causeways and creeks.<br>
        <br>
        “This reduces erosion and keeps the water in the creeks
        cleaner,” she says. “If we can make the water even cleaner with
        this new research, it will be great for our farm.”<br>

          </big></div>
        <br>
        A new diagnostic system used to detect cancer cells in small
        blood samples could next be turned towards filtering a patient’s
        entire system to remove those dangerous cells – like a dialysis
        machine for cancer – says an Australian researcher who helped
        develop the system.<br>
        <br>
        The technique was developed for cancer diagnosis, and is capable
        of detecting (and removing) a tiny handful of cancer-spreading
        cells from amongst the billions of healthy cells in a small
        blood sample.<br>
        <br>
        The revolutionary system, which works to diagnose cancer at a
        tenth of the cost of competing technologies, is now in clinical
        trials in the US, UK, Singapore and Australia, and is in the
        process of being commercialised by Clearbridge BioMedics PteLtd
        in Singapore.<br>
        <br>
        “It’s like a non-invasive ‘liquid biopsy’ that can flag the
        presence of any type of solid cancer – like lung, breast, bowel,
        and so on – without the need for surgery,” says Dr Majid
        Warkiani, a lecturer at the School of Mechanical and
        Manufacturing Engineering at the University of New South Wales,
        and a project leader at the Australian Centre for NanoMedicine
        at UNSW.<br>
        Isolation of Circulating Tumour Cells<br>
        <br>
        The initial challenge in developing the early-warning diagnosis
        system was to find those few cancer cells amongst billions of
        healthy blood cells. That challenge was met by a system that
        ‘spins out’ and isolates circulating tumour cells (CTCs), which
        are shed into the bloodstream from a solid tumour and can
        establish tumours elsewhere in the body—the mechanism by which
        cancer spreads through the body.<br>
        <br>
        The ‘liquid biopsy’ can thus be used both for early cancer
        diagnosis and for monitoring a patient’s response to treatment.<br>
        <br>
        But the potential for the new system goes far beyond just
        diagnosis.<br>
        <br>
        If the filtering system could be scaled up, a cancer patient’s
        entire blood supply could potentially be similarly filtered,
        removing the dangerous cells and cycling the rest of the
        patient’s blood back into their system. It would be similar to
        dialysis treatment for kidney patients.<br>
        <br>
        “It would be a revolution in cancer treatment. You would keep
        filtering out the dangerous cells, prolonging the life of the
        patient,” says Dr Warkiani. “There is still a long way to
        go—including securing money and support in Australia—before this
        is possible.’<br>
        <br>
        But he believes this new technology will become one of the
        essential components of routine cancer management in the near
        future.<br>
        <br>
        “A therapeutic version of this system, used for blood cleansing,
        could make the cancer a chronic disease and decrease drastically
        its mortality rate,” he says…<br>

        <br>
        MELBOURNE researchers have developed cows' milk that can defend
        human cells against HIV.<br>
        <br>
        The next stage is to test the effectiveness and safety of the
        milk before making it into a cream which will hopefully allow
        women to protect themselves against contracting the virus during
        sex, without relying on men.<br>
        <br>
        It came as a new report today showed the number of HIV diagnoses
        in Australia had grown over the past decade, with an 8 per cent
        spike in new cases detected last year.<br>
        <br>
        Lead researcher, University of Melbourne's Marit Kramski said
        they vaccinated pregnant cows - which cannot contract human
        immunodeficiency virus - with an HIV protein and studied the
        first milk produced by the cow after birth.<br>
        <br>
        Dr Kramski said this first milk, called colostrum, produced milk
        high in antibodies to protect its newborn against disease.<br>
        <br>
        The researchers were able to inhibit the virus from infecting
        cells when combing the virus cells with milk.<br>
        <br>
        "We think the antibodies bind to the surface of the virus and
        blocks the protein which needs to be freed to get in contact
        with human cells - like a key and lock system. If the key's not
        accessible or you change the key, you can't open the door," Dr
        Kramski said.<br>
        <br>
        "It's a very cheap and easy way to produce a lot of antibodies."<br>
        <br>
        Dr Kramski said they had partnered with Australian biotechnology
        company Immuron Ltd to develop the milk, and would continue
        working with them to produce a preventative cream.<br>
        <br>
        But she said a cream or gel could be a decade off.<br>
        <br>
        "We have the antibodies at the moment - the next step will be
        formulation," Dr Kramski said.<br>
        <br>
        Dr Kramski said condoms were "cheap and easy" but not an option
        for everyone with millions of people getting infected with HIV
        every year.<br>
        <br>
        "A lot of women, especially in Africa or South America they
        don't have the power to say you need to use a condom before we
        have sex," she said.<br>
        <br>
        "This milk looks like it can be a cheap, easy new prevention
        tool, because if you use drugs it's really expensive."<br>
        <br>
        Clinical trials for other HIV prevention creams, however -
        including Carraguard containing an anti-HIV microbicide - found
        the product to be safe but not effective in reducing spread of
        HIV.<br>
        <br>
        There are about 34 million people currently living with HIV
        worldwide<br>

        FIBRE has long been known to clean the bowel but it has now been
        found to deliver cleansing antioxidants to the colon as well,
        meaning it helps prevent stomach diseases such as cancer in two
        ways.<br>
        <br>
        University of Queensland scientist Anneline Padayachee made the
        discovery after her work at a juicing factory prompted her to
        wonder how much goodness was being thrown away in the pulp left
        behind by juicing machines.<br>
        <br>
        What she discovered is that much of the antioxidant compounds in
        fruits and vegetables are actually attached to the fibre in the
        pulpy parts of these foods.<br>
        <br>
        The fibre delivers the compounds, called polyphenols, to the
        colon and releases them there, helping to prevent cancerous cell
        damage.<br>
        <br>
        In the case of black carrots, which are rich in polyphenols, 80
        per cent of their antioxidants are found in the fibrous, pulpy
        parts.<br>
        <br>
        Previously fibre was thought to be of benefit only because it
        cleaned the bowel and it was not known to deliver antioxidants.<br>
        <br>
        Presenting her research at a Fresh Science event in Melbourne on
        Monday, Dr Padayachee said it showed it is important that people
        either eat whole fruit and vegetables or, if they are juicing
        them, drink pulpy juices rather than clear thinned-out juices to
        get antioxidants into their system.<br>
        <br>
        "To gain the benefits of polyphenols, you need to consume
        everything, the whole vegetable or fruit, including the fibrous
        pulp if you're juicing it," Dr Padayachee said.<br>
        <br>
        "Not only will you have a clean gut but a healthy gut full of
        polyphenols."<br>
        <br>
        The four-year research project, jointly funded by the University
        of Queensland Centre for Nutrition and Food Science, the CSIRO
        and the Australian Research Council, finished in 2012.<br>
        <br>
        Scientists are now researching whether fibre can be used to
        deliver and release medicines to the colon and will look at ways
        of using fruit and vegetable pulps in different manufactured
        food products.<br>

        <br>
        Queensland scientists say spit from a cancer-causing parasite
        may contain a hormone that can make wounds heal quicker.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Spit produced by a cancer-causing worm that eats away at your
        liver can super-charge damaged human cells so they heal quicker.<br>
        <br>
        Queensland scientists say a growth hormone found in the
        Southeast Asian liver fluke's spit could be used to treat
        chronic wounds that won't heal.<br>
        <br>
        "It would likely be used in a gel (which would be applied to the
        wound) and the protein would super-charge your insulin
        response," James Cook University researcher Dr Michael Smout
        told AAP.<br>
        <br>
        "We've shown it increases wound healing speed and now we're
        looking at how it's doing that."<br>
        <br>
        Dr Smout and his colleagues have been studying the parasite,
        which causes cancer and kills tens of thousands of people in
        Southeast Asia, in the hope of finding a vaccine.<br>
        <br>
        People contract the worm, which lives in more than nine million
        people but is rarely found in Australia, by ingesting
        contaminated raw fish.<br>
        <br>
        Researchers found that as the parasite eats away at a person's
        liver it simultaneously repairs the damage it has made.<br>
        <br>
        The newly discovered hormone in the fluke's spit is thought to
        be responsible for the repair job, encouraging damaged cells to
        repair quicker.<br>
        <br>
        Unfortunately the hormone can also encourage cells to multiply
        quickly and uncontrollably which can stimulate the growth of
        cancer cells.<br>
        <br>
        Dr Smout says it appears the parasite releases the growth
        hormone to ensure the longevity of its food supply.<br>
        <br>
        "This is good for the host in the short term but repeated
        wounding and healing over decades... can lead to this deadly
        form of cancer," Dr Smout said.<br>
        <br>
        The parasite, which can be treated with drugs, kills more than
        20,000 people each year in Thailand alone.<br>
        <br>
        Dr Smout and his colleagues are hopeful their research will lead
        to vaccines to prevent cancer in impoverished parts of Asia and
        to new treatments for non-healing wounds.<br>
        <br>
        Chronic wounds don't heal normally or take significantly longer
        to heal and are an increasing problem for smokers, diabetics and
        the elderly.<br>

        Munich Physicists have developed a novel electron microscope
        that can visualize electromagnetic fields oscillating at
        frequencies of billions of cycles per second.<br>
        <br>
        Temporally varying electromagnetic fields are the driving force
        behind the whole of electronics. Their polarities can change at
        mind-bogglingly fast rates, and it is difficult to capture them
        in action. However, a better understanding of the dynamics of
        field variation in electronic components, such as transistors,
        is indispensable for future advances in electronics. Researchers
        in the Laboratory for Attosecond Physics (LAP), jointly run by
        Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität (LMU) and the Max Planck
        Institute of Quantum Optics (MPQ), have now taken an important
        step towards this goal -- by building an electron microscope
        that can image high-frequency electromagnetic fields and trace
        their ultrafast dynamics.<br>
        <br>
        The electronic devices we have become so familiar with and use
        every day are -- without exception -- powered by changing
        electromagnetic fields. These fields control the flow of
        electrons in components such as 'field-effect' transistors, and
        are ultimately responsible for the manipulation, flow and
        storage of data in our computers and smartphones. A better
        understanding of electromagnetic waveforms and their ultrafast
        reconfiguration in individual components will help to shape the
        future of electronics. The LMU and MPQ physicists who belong to
        the research group in Ultrafast Electron Imaging have now
        developed an electron microscope that is specifically designed
        for the analysis of rapidly varying electromagnetic fields.<br>
        <br>
        This instrument makes use of ultrashort pulses of laser light,
        each of which lasts for a few femtoseconds (a femtosecond equals
        one millionth of a billionth (10-15) of a second). These laser
        pulses are used to generate bunches of electrons made up of very
        few particles, which are then temporally compressed by the
        action of terahertz (1012 Hz) near-infrared radiation. The
        Munich team first described this strategy earlier this year in
        the journal Science, and demonstrated that it can generate
        electron pulses that are shorter than a half-cycle of the
        optical field.<br>
        <br>
        The researchers now show that these ultrashort electron pulses
        can be used to map high-frequency electromagnetic fields. In the
        experiment, the pulses are directed onto a microantenna that has
        just interacted with a precisely timed burst of terahertz
        radiation. The light pulse excites surface electrons in the
        antenna, thus creating an oscillating optical (electromagnetic)
        field in the immediate vicinity (the so-called near field) of
        the target. When the electron pulses come under the influence of
        the induced electromagnetic field around the antenna, they are
        scattered, and the pattern of their deflection is recorded. On
        the basis of the dispersion of the deflected electrons, the
        researchers can reconstruct the spatial distribution, temporal
        variation, orientation and polarization of the light emitted by
        the microantenna.<br>
        <br>
        "In order to visualize electromagnetic fields oscillating at
        optical frequencies, two important conditions must be met,"
        explains Dr. Peter Baum, who led the team and supervised the
        experiments. "The duration of each electron pulse, and the time
        it takes to pass through through the region of interest, must
        both be less than a single oscillation period of the light
        field." The electron pulses used in the experiment propagate at
        speeds approximately equal to half the speed of light.<br>
        <br>
        With their novel extension of the principle of the electron
        microscope, the Munich physicists have shown that it should be
        feasible to precisely detect and measure even the tiniest and
        most rapidly oscillating electromagnetic fields. This will allow
        researchers to obtain a detailed understanding of how
        transistors or optoelectronic switches operate at the
        microscopic level.<br>
        <br>
        The new technology is also of interest for the development and
        analysis of so-called metamaterials. Metamaterials are
        synthetic, patterned nanostructures, whose permeability and
        permittivity for electrical and magnetic fields, respectively,
        deviate fundamentally from those of materials found in nature.
        This in turn gives rise to novel optical phenomena which cannot
        be realized in conventional materials. Metamaterials therefore
        open up entirely new perspectives in optics and optoelectronics,
        and could provide the basic building blocks for the fabrication
        of components for light-driven circuits and computers. The new
        approach to the characterization of electromagnetic waveforms
        based on the use of attosecond physics brings us a step closer
        to the electronics of the future. <br>

        f we are a simulation being run by some extra-dimensional

        Oxygen, a less discussed gas that is essential for life.
        Recently NASA came out with a video that was so deceptive as to
        be criminal. We DO NOT get the bulk of our breathable oxygen
        from the land mass. Which is what the video implied, as a result
        of increased CO2. We get it from the oceans. And as our research
        revealed, our oceans are dying. Fast. You wanna see something
        _REALLY_ scary?<br>
        <br>
        There is nothing to fear. The tiger is upon us now. We can only
        accept our fate with dignity. We were told.<br>
        <br>
        Our oxygen levels are dropping. Not only from decreasing
        supplies from our oceans, but from competition from any
        combustive source, like engines of all kinds, heating gas and
        oil, from oxidation (rust and oxidizing chemicals and
        materials).<br>
        <br>
        There will be one final video in which we will share the
        logical, rational answers to save us from the 6th Mass
        Extinction. It would require a paradigm shift and cooperation
        that makes it essentially impossible, but it has to be put out
        there. Once again, we are telling you what is happening and what
        to do. We didn't listen the first time, if we don't accept the
        answers this time, then all the pussyfooting around the abrupt
        and catastrophic climate change taking place, then that final
        nail will be in place in our collective coffins.<br>

        function is originating from the addition of quarternary
        ammonium salts to existing dental polymer resins. The positively
        charged salts disrupt the negatively charged membranes of
        bacteria, which burst and die. Although the material kills
        bacterial cells upon contact, it is not harmful to human cells.<br>

        Lost a tooth? Soon your dentist could print you another – and
        it’ll help keep your mouth clean, too.<br>
        <br>
        Getting fitted for a false tooth or other dental treatment tends
        to involve a mouthful of foul-tasting gunk and plaster casts.
        But now dentists are moving to high-tech digital scanning and 3D
        printing. That switch opens the door to more advanced materials
        that could improve your oral hygiene.<br>
        <br>
        Andreas Herrmann of the University of Groningen in the
        Netherlands and his colleagues have developed an antimicrobial
        plastic, allowing them to 3D print teeth that also kill
        bacteria. It’s an important issue, say the team, because
        bacterial damage to existing implants costs patients millions of
        dollars in the US alone.<br>
        .<br>
        The team embedded antimicrobial quaternary ammonium salts inside
        existing dental resin polymers. The salts are positively charged
        and so disrupt the negatively charged bacterial membranes,
        causing them to burst and die. “The material can kill bacteria
        on contact, but on the other hand it’s not harmful to human
        cells,” says Hermann.<br>
        <br>
        Then they put this mix in a 3D printer, hardened it with
        ultraviolet light and printed out a range of dental objects such
        as replacement teeth and orthodontic braces. To test its
        antimicrobial properties, they coated samples of the material in
        mix of saliva and Streptococcus mutans, the bacterium that
        causes tooth decay. They found the material killed over 99 per
        cent of the bacteria, compared to less than 1 per cent for a
        control sample without the added salts.<br>
        <br>
        Further tests will have to be done before the material can be
        rolled out to patients, as the team only left the samples in the
        saliva and bacteria mix for six days. “For clinical used we need
        to extend this, and investigate the compatibility with
        toothpaste,” says Herrmann.<br>
        <br>
        They also need to confirm the plastic is strong enough to use as
        a tooth, but he thinks it shouldn’t take too long. “It’s a
        medical product with a foreseeable application in the near
        future, much less time than developing a new drug.”<br>

        </b><b>Abstract</b><br>
        <br>
        3D printing is seen as a game-changing manufacturing process in
        many domains, including general medicine and dentistry, but the
        integration of more complex functions into 3D-printed materials
        remains lacking. Here, it is expanded on the repertoire of
        3D-printable materials to include antimicrobial polymer resins,
        which are essential for development of medical devices due to
        the high incidence of biomaterial-associated infections.
        Monomers containing antimicrobial, positively charged quaternary
        ammonium groups with an appended alkyl chain are either directly
        copolymerized with conventional
        diurethanedimethacrylate/glycerol dimethacrylate (UDMA/GDMA)
        resin components by photocuring or prepolymerized as a linear
        chain for incorporation into a semi-interpenetrating polymer
        network by light-induced polymerization. For both strategies,
        dental 3D-printed objects fabricated by a stereolithography
        process kill bacteria on contact when positively charged
        quaternary ammonium groups are incorporated into the
        photocurable UDMA/GDMA resins. Leaching of quaternary ammonium
        monomers copolymerized with UDMA/GDMA resins is limited and
        without biological consequences within 4–6 d, while biological
        consequences could be confined to 1 d when prepolymerized
        quaternary ammonium group containing chains are incorporated in
        a semi-interpenetrating polymer network. Routine clinical
        handling and mechanical properties of the pristine polymer
        matrix are maintained upon incorporation of quaternary ammonium
        groups, qualifying the antimicrobially functionalized,
        3D-printable composite resins for clinical use.<br>

        A group of physicists in Germany claims to have discovered a way
        of speeding up radioactive decay that could render nuclear waste
        harmless on timescales of just a few tens of years. Their
        proposed technique – which involves slashing the half-life of an
        alpha emitter by embedding it in a metal and cooling the metal
        to a few degrees kelvin – could therefore avoid the need to bury
        nuclear waste in deep repositories, a hugely expensive and
        politically difficult process. But other researchers are
        sceptical and believe that the technique contradicts
        well-established theory as well as experiment.<br>
        <br>
        The leader of the German-based group, Claus Rolfs of Ruhr
        University in Bochum, is an astrophysicist and made the
        discovery about alpha decay after replicating the fusion
        reactions that take place in the centre of stars. Using the
        university’s particle accelerator he fired protons and deuterons
        (nuclei containing a proton and a neutron) at various light
        nuclei. He noticed that the rate of fusion reactions was
        significantly greater when the nuclei were encased in metals
        than when they were inserted into insulators. He also observed
        that the effect is enhanced at lower temperatures (J. Phys. G:
        Nucl. Part. Phys. 32 489).<br>
        <br>
        Rolfs believed this effect could be explained in simple terms by
        assuming that the free electrons in a metal act like the
        electrons in a plasma, as described in a model by Dutch
        physicist Peter Debye. The lower the temperature of the metal,
        the closer the free electrons get to the radioactive nuclei.
        These electrons accelerate positively charged particles towards
        the nuclei, thereby increasing the probability of fusion
        reactions.<br>
        <br>
        But Rolfs realized that the reverse reaction might also occur
        and that free electrons could enhance the ejection of positively
        charged particles from a nucleus. This would reduce the
        half-lives of α-decay or β+-decay, and increase half-lives for
        processes involving electrons (which are repelled by the free
        electrons within the metal), i.e. β–-decay and electron capture.<br>
        <br>
        The group has investigated this hypothesis by embedding a number
        of radioactive nuclei inside metals and then cooling the metal
        to a few degrees kelvin. As expected, they observed a longer
        half-life for the electron capture of beryllium-7 and shorter
        half-lives for β+-decay in sodium-22 (Eur. Phys. J. A 28 251)
        and α-decay in polonium-210. They are now investigating the
        α-decay of radium-226, a hazardous component of spent nuclear
        fuel with a half-life of 1600 years. Rolfs calculates that this
        half-life could be reduced to as little as a year and at the
        very least to 100 years, and believes that the half-lives of all
        other hazardous alpha emitters within nuclear waste could be
        shortened by similar amounts.<br>
        <br>
        "This means that nuclear waste could probably be dealt with
        entirely within the lifetimes of the people that produce it," he
        says. "We would not have to put it underground and let our
        great-great-grandchildren pay the price for our high standard of
        living."<br>
        <br>
        Rolfs admits that much engineering research needs to be done to
        convert his idea into practice, but he believes there are
        probably no insurmountable technical barriers. Other physicists,
        however, think that the basic idea may be flawed. According to
        Nick Stone, a nuclear physicist recently retired from Oxford
        University, physicists have already carried out experiments in
        which they cooled alpha emitters to 4 K and below, but found no
        significant changes in their half-lives.<br>
        <br>
        Meanwhile, Hubert Flocard, director of the CSNSM nuclear-physics
        lab near Paris, believes that Rolfs' model contradicts standard
        solid-state physics, although he admits that he cannot explain
        the group's data himself. Rolfs concedes that he needs a more
        sophisticated theory, but stands by his results. "Nature decides
        what is right," he says.<br>

        <br>
        At the ripe old age of twenty, Benjamin Franklin set out to make
        himself morally perfect. Having studied the ancient philosophers
        and their ideas of the virtues required to be an ideal man, he
        created his own list of thirteen virtues. Like the virtue
        ethicists of the ancient past and more modern times, Franklin
        sought to develop his entire character rather than focus on the
        question of how to act in a certain situation. His hope being
        that with the perfection of his character, he would never again
        have to ask how to act, as he would simply act as a virtuous
        person would by habit. Never again would he commit a fault at
        any time, he thought.<br>
        <br>
        His selections were ordered by importance, and he saw the
        earliest ones as being needed to achieve the latter ones. They
        were also chosen for simplicity, as each covers a small and
        defined area of character.<br>
        <br>
        1. Temperance. Eat not to dullness; drink not to elevation. <br>
        <br>
        2. Silence. Speak not but what may benefit others or yourself;
        avoid trifling conversation.<br>
        <br>
        3. Order. Let all your things have their places; let each part
        of your business have its time.<br>
        <br>
        4. Resolution. Resolve to perform what you ought; perform
        without fail what you resolve.<br>
        <br>
        5. Frugality. Make no expense but to do good to others or
        yourself; i.e., waste nothing.<br>
        <br>
        6. Industry. Lose no time; be always employ'd in something
        useful; cut off all unnecessary actions.<br>
        <br>
        7. Sincerity. Use no hurtful deceit; think innocently and
        justly, and, if you speak, speak accordingly.<br>
        <br>
        8. Justice. Wrong none by doing injuries, or omitting the
        benefits that are your duty.<br>
        <br>
        9. Moderation. Avoid extremes; forbear resenting injuries so
        much as you think they deserve.<br>
        <br>
        10. Cleanliness. Tolerate no uncleanliness in body, clothes, or
        habitation.<br>
        <br>
        11. Tranquillity. Be not disturbed at trifles, or at accidents
        common or unavoidable.<br>
        <br>
        12. Chastity. Rarely use venery but for health or offspring,
        never to dullness, weakness, or the injury of your own or
        another's peace or reputation.<br>
        <br>
        13. Humility. Imitate Jesus and Socrates.<br>
        <br>
        His method of enacting these virtues was simple, on a weekly
        basis he focused on one virtue and one alone, leaving the others
        to chance and the strength of his character. At the end of each
        day, he reflected on rather or not he had lived up to that
        virtue, and recorded the answer. His goal was to make each
        virtue a habit, and thus achieve moral perfection.<br>
        <br>
        By his own admission his failures in reaching moral perfection
        were many and often of great magnitude. His acknowledged
        illegitimate son William, his often indomitable pride, and his
        love for wine which occasionally went to excess are both
        admitted and well known.<br>
        <br>
        He also noted that his career choices often prevented him from
        reaching the ideal of “Order”, often by no real fault of his
        own.<br>
        <br>
        As he noted: “My scheme of Order gave me the most trouble; and I
        found that, tho' it might be practicable where a man's business
        was such as to leave him the disposition of his time, that of a
        journeyman printer, for instance, it was not possible to be
        exactly observed by a master, who must mix with the world, and
        often receive people of business at their own hours.”<br>
        <br>
        However, despite never reaching moral perfection and having the
        major failures that he acknowledged in his own character. He
        still continued the project for most of his life. It was the
        attempt at reaching an ideal that made him better, even if he
        was remarkably far from reaching it.<br>
        <br>
        In his own words: “In truth, I myself incorrigible with respect
        to Order; and now I am grown old, and my memory bad, I feel very
        sensibly the want of it. But, on the whole, tho' I never arrived
        at the perfection I had been so ambitious of obtaining, but fell
        far short of it, yet I was, by the endeavor, a better and a
        happier man than I otherwise should have been if I had not
        attempted it; as those who aim at perfect writing by imitating
        the engraved copies, tho' they never reach the wished-for
        excellence of those copies, their hand is mended by the
        endeavor, and tolerable, while it continues fair and legible.”<br>
        <br>
        Even when he was unable to reach the ideals of personal growth,
        by either his own vices or by circumstance, he was constantly
        able to improve by means of practice. And, in the end, isn’t
        that what matters?<br>

        <div align="center"><big><b>The Secret to Gaining the Upper Hand
              in Negotiations, with a Former FBI Negotiator</b></big><br>
          <br>
        </div>
        Negotiating is hard, and it’s even harder when there is
        something you really want. The stakes are higher, and you may
        not know how to get the upper hand. Negotiating takes skill,
        it's something that a person needs to hone over time through
        practice, so they can carefully judge when to swoop in for a win
        and when to hold back. It’s a delicate, instinctual art. But it
        can definitely be learned.<br>
        <br>
        According to Chris Voss (former FBI crisis negotiator, and
        founder and CEO of the Black Swan Group), the key to mastering
        the art of negotiation is empathy. Specifically, it is making
        the other person empathize with you.<br>
        <br>
        By making someone look at things from your point of view, they
        have to see what position they’re putting you in. All it takes
        is one golden question, “How am I supposed to do that?”<br>
        <br>
        As Voss states, these could be the most important seven words
        you ever say in a negotiation. This is going to throw the ball
        in your opponent’s court. They will call the next shot -- while
        subconsciously seeing the situation from your side of the
        argument. It's sly genius. They have to understand what you’re
        thinking, and ask themselves if you can actually reasonably do
        what they expect of you. If they can’t come up with an answer or
        the answer is ‘I don’t know’ - even better. It highlights their
        unreasonable request, and gives you the chance to speak and gain
        valuable ground.<br>
        <br>
        This question also gives your negotiating opponent the illusion
        of control. Many times, especially dealing with employers,
        people have the need to be in absolute control. Without the Boss
        in Charge feeling, they will focus on getting the upper hand,
        which can make them difficult and stubborn. So instead, give
        them control by appearing submissive, and asking a question that
        defers to them for wisdom on how you are supposed to do said
        thing. It’s a very simple strategy to get people to see multiple
        points of view, and force them to empathize with who they are
        negotiating. Once they empathize, it’s harder to ignore your
        requests.<br>

        <div align="center"><big><b>Learn a Key Negotiating Skill from
              an FBI Negotiator: "No" Is Greater than "Yes"</b></big><br>
        </div>
        <br>
        We assume that getting a "yes" from the other side is the goal
        of any negotiation, but former lead FBI negotiator Chris Voss
        says knowing how to get a "no" is actually more important. <br>
        <br>
        Chris Voss: You know, successful negotiation is not about
        getting to yes, it's about mastering no and understanding what
        the path to an agreement is. Now people are constantly trying to
        trap us by giving us to say yes. I mean we get hammered on this
        every single day. Lawyers actually have a term for it they call
        it cornering. And there's a theory of negotiation out of there
        called mirror agreement that says the more little yeses I get
        out of you the more likely you are to say yes to a big yes. So I
        don't know if that was ever true, but I know that we get
        hammered so much day in and day out with people trying to trap
        us with yes; trying to corner us; trying to lead us places by
        getting us to say yes, that we get defensive instantly when
        someone tries to get us to say yes. So you've got to get out of
        the getting to yes mindset, instead understand that yes is
        commitment and we're always worried about what we've let
        ourselves in for when we make a commitment.<br>
        <br>
        There are three kinds of yeses. There's commitment confirmation
        and counterfeit. People are most used to giving the counterfeit
        yes because they've been trapped by the confirmation yes so many
        times. So the way you master no is understanding what really
        happens when somebody says no. When yes is commitment, no is
        protection. If you say no and you just protected yourself,
        you're actually a little more open to hearing what the other
        side has to say, because you're not worried about what you've
        committed yourself to. So you can take most questions that are
        designed to get yes and simply turn them into the same question
        where the answer is no and it gets you to the same place. If a
        boss gives an employee an impossible task and the employee says,
        "Well you want me to be successful don't you?" That's pushing
        for a yes. The flipside question to that instead is, "Do you
        want me to fail?"<br>
        <br>
        It's stunning what people are comfortable saying no to. So first
        of all understanding that you can use a no to make somebody feel
        protected and a little more open-minded to hearing what you have
        to say. Now the second move after that is what do you want them
        to say next? What you really want them to say is that's right.
        You want to be able to summarize how they feel about things and
        what the circumstances are so that they feel that you got it, so
        much so that they look at you in the eye and say, "That's
        right." And that's what we say at any given point in time when
        we see something that we know is completely true that we're in
        complete agreement, we say, “That right!” almost as if we're so
        totally behind it. It may even have been a partial epiphany
        we're so behind it. We've just heard something that we feel is
        the indisputable true. And in many cases a really good that's
        right is summarized in a way that the other person was actually
        blind to. They didn't know that those forces were driving them
        or those passions, but when you say it to them it creates an
        epiphany on some level where you pointed something out to them
        that's true that they didn't even realize.<br>
        <br>
        They're showing us and telling us that they feel empathy from
        us. And anytime you feel empathy from somsebody else you feel
        bonded to them. You want to collaborate with them. You want to
        do whatever you can for them. And that's a great way to find out
        what kind of latitude somebody has in a deal. And everybody's
        got latitude someplace. What you want to do is put people in a
        position where they feel connected enough to you that they're
        willing to collaborate with you, they're willing to show you the
        things that they were scared to tell you about before. The cards
        that everybody holds in a negotiation that if you could just see
        those cards you might be able to negotiate a completely
        different deal.<br>
        <br>
        Well, that's where this entire approach is really going because
        everybody has cards they're not showing in a negotiation.
        Everybody. And if you can get the other side to show you those
        cards, we call them black swans, the little things that make all
        the difference, if you can get them to show you the black swans
        then you can probably make a better deal than you've ever had in
        mind.<br>

              Success About Our Times</b></big><br>
        </div>
        <br>
        During the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, Our Lady of Good
        Success appeared in Quito, Ecuador to a Spanish nun whose
        little-known but extraordinary life has a direct connection with
        our days.<br>
        <br>
        The Pope’s “infallibility will be declared a dogma of Faith by
        the same Pope chosen to proclaim the dogma of the mystery of my
        Immaculate Conception. He will be persecuted and imprisoned in
        the Vatican through the usurpation of the Pontifical States and
        through the malice, envy, and avarice of an earthly monarch.”<br>
        <br>
        “Unbridled passions will give way to a total corruption of
        customs because Satan will reign through the Masonic sects,
        targeting the children in particular to insure general
        corruption.<br>
        <br>
        “Unhappy, the children of those times! Seldom will they receive
        the sacraments of Baptism and Confirmation. As for the sacrament
        of Penance, they will confess only while attending Catholic
        schools, which the devil will do his utmost to destroy by means
        of persons in authority.<br>
        <br>
        “The same will occur with Holy Communion. Oh, how it hurts me to
        tell you that there will be many and enormous public and hidden
        sacrileges!<br>
        <br>
        “In those times, the sacrament of Extreme Unction will be
        largely ignored.… Many will die without receiving it, being
        thereby deprived of innumerable graces, consolation, and
        strength in the great leap from time to eternity.<br>
        <br>
        “The sacrament of Matrimony, which symbolizes the union of
        Christ with the Church, will be thoroughly attacked and
        profaned. Masonry, then reigning, will implement iniquitous laws
        aimed at extinguishing this sacrament. They will make it easy
        for all to live in sin, thus multiplying the birth of
        illegitimate children without the Church’s blessing….<br>
        <br>
        “Secular education will contribute to a scarcity of priestly and
        religious vocations.”<br>
        <br>
        “The holy sacrament of Holy Orders will be ridiculed, oppressed,
        and despised, for in this both the Church and God Himself are
        oppressed and reviled, since He is represented by His priests.<br>
        <br>
        “The devil will work to persecute the ministers of the Lord in
        every way, working with baneful cunning to destroy the spirit of
        their vocation and corrupting many. Those who will thus
        scandalize the Christian flock will bring upon all priests the
        hatred of bad Christians and the enemies of the One, Holy, Roman
        Catholic, and Apostolic Church. This apparent triumph of Satan
        will cause enormous suffering to the good pastors of the
        Church...and to the Supreme Pastor and Vicar of Christ on earth
        who, a prisoner in the Vatican, will shed secret and bitter
        tears in the presence of God Our Lord, asking for light,
        sanctity, and perfection for all the clergy of the world, to
        whom he is King and Father.”<br>
        <br>
        “Unhappy times will come wherein those who should fearlessly
        defend the rights of the Church will instead, blinded despite
        the light, give their hand to the Church’s enemies and do their
        bidding. But when [evil] seems triumphant and when authority
        abuses its power, committing all manner of injustice and
        oppressing the weak, their ruin shall be near. They will fall
        and crash to the ground.<br>
        <br>
        “Then will the Church, joyful and triumphant like a young girl,
        reawaken and be comfortably cradled in the arms of my most dear
        and elect son of those times. If he lends an ear to the
        inspirations of grace–one of which will be the reading of these
        great mercies that my Son and I have had toward you–we shall
        fill him with graces and very special gifts and will make him
        great on earth and much greater in Heaven. There we have
        reserved a precious seat for him because, heedless of men, he
        will have fought for truth and ceaselessly defended the rights
        of the Church, deserving to be called ‘martyr.’”<br>
        <br>
        “At the end of the nineteenth century and throughout a great
        part of the twentieth, many heresies will be propagated in these
        lands.…<br>
        <br>
        “The small number of souls who will secretly safeguard the
        treasure of Faith and virtues will suffer a cruel, unspeakable,
        and long martyrdom. Many will descend to their graves through
        the violence of suffering and will be counted among the martyrs
        who sacrificed themselves for the country and the Church.<br>
        <br>
        “To be delivered from the slavery of these heresies, those whom
        the merciful love of my Son has destined for this restoration
        will need great will-power, perseverance, courage, and
        confidence in God. To try the faith and trust of these just
        ones, there will be times when all will seem lost and paralyzed.
        It will then be the happy beginning of the complete
        restoration….<br>
        <br>
        “In those times the atmosphere will be saturated with the spirit
        of impurity which, like a filthy sea, will engulf the streets
        and public places with incredible license.… Innocence will
        scarcely be found in children, or modesty in women.<br>
        <br>
        “He who should speak seasonably will remain silent.<br>
        <br>
        “There shall be scarcely any virgin souls in the world. The
        delicate flower of virginity will seek refuge in the
        cloisters.…Without virginity, fire from heaven will be needed to
        purify these lands.…<br>
        <br>
        “Sects, having permeated all social classes, will find ways of
        introducing themselves into the very heart of homes to corrupt
        the innocence of children. The children’s hearts will be dainty
        morsels to regale the devil.…<br>
        <br>
        “Religious communities will remain to sustain the Church and
        work with courage for the salvation of souls.… The secular
        clergy will fall far short of what is expected of them because
        they will not pursue their sacred duty. Losing the divine
        compass, they will stray from the way of priestly ministry
        mapped out for them by God and will become devoted to money,
        seeking it too earnestly.<br>
        <br>
        “Pray constantly, implore tirelessly, and weep bitter tears in
        the seclusion of your heart, beseeching the Eucharistic Heart of
        my most holy Son to take pity on His ministers and to end as
        soon as possible these unhappy times by sending to His Church
        the Prelate who shall restore the spirit of her priests.”<br>

            <b>SURVIVING AND PROFITING FROM THE DISASTERS OF JUBILEE
              YEAR 2016</b></big><br>
        </div>
        <br>
        ...This White Paper is intended to help you protect you against
        the destruction of the Jubilee Year – which is actually a
        Shemitah Super Trend extension.<br>
        <br>
        Last year in a video, white paper and numerous articles, I
        explained that a seven-year cycle called Shemitah provided a
        series of destructive daily and end-year events.<br>
        <br>
        My Shemitah analysis emerged from my normal investment research.
        It was not ultimately “religious” in nature, nor was it intended
        to be a commentary on Jewish beliefs.<br>
        <br>
        It was simply a series of observations that proved to be true.<br>
        <br>
        Now we are facing another terrible challenge, the Jubilee Year.
        Unfortunately, Jubilee and Shemitah are linked together.<br>
        <br>
        I am not even prepared to say if they are “Jewish” or not. Or
        why those involved&nbsp; have decided to use Jewish mystical
        dates to inflict carnage on the rest of the world.&nbsp; Or how
        much of this could actually be supernatural.<br>
        <br>
        I only know what my research shows: The year of the Shemitah is
        generally marked by economic and sociopolitical disasters and,
        even worse, the seventh Shemitah is even more intense, as is the
        Jubilee Year that is linked to it at this time.<br>
        <br>
        Last year we experienced a seventh Shemitah. This year we are
        experiencing Jubilee. The Jubilee Year is real and part of the
        terrible plans of the financial elite…<br>
        <br>
        <b>Discovering Shemitah and the Jubilee Year</b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        I first heard about the Shemitah only a few years ago when
        Jonathan Cahn put out his best selling book, The
        Harbinger.&nbsp; I’m not sure what drew me to the book, but once
        I read it I was shocked at the information he had uncovered.<br>
        <br>
        According to Jonathan, on God’s timetable, every seven years is
        supposed to be a year of ‘washing away.’&nbsp; Just like there
        are seven days in the week and one of them is supposed to be a
        day of cessation, this also applies to every seven years.&nbsp;
        And, according to the Bible, Jewish people are supposed to
        forgive their debts every seven years.<br>
        <br>
        Cahn had discovered the exact dates for the Shemitah on the
        Hebrew calendar and showed how Shemitah end days have
        corresponded eerily well with market collapses and other major
        events.<br>
        <br>
        In fact, prior to the most recent Shemitah, the last two major
        market collapses happened on the exact end day of the Shemitah
        in 2001 and 2008...<br>

        POPE WARNS OF JUBILEE YEAR: The Pope uses the words ‘Jubilee
        Year’ to warn about 2016’s upcoming events. On December 8th of
        2015 the Pope, completely unexpectedly and without warning,
        issued an “emergency Jubilee year” while rolling out men in
        machine guns and declaring a no-fly zone near the Vatican.
        Catholic Holy Jubilee Years normally take place every 25 years
        unless a Pope decrees an extraordinary one to bring attention to
        a particular need or topic. The next one was to be held in 2025
        but Pope Francis called a special emergency one in December,
        2015.&nbsp; He then went on to warn the world of impending
        disaster. In a solemn sermon at the Vatican, Pope Francis
        announced that Christmas, 2015 was a “charade” due to the fact
        that the globe is currently engaging in the beginning of World
        War III. Even worse, he said, “While the world starves, burns,
        and descends further into chaos, we should realize that this
        year’s Christmas celebrations for those who choose to celebrate
        it may be their last.”...<br>

        GUIDESTONES PREDICT GENOCIDE IN 2016: The famous Georgia
        Guidestones seem to contain clues that point to August 14th,
        2016 as a significant date regarding a predicted genocide
        encompassing millions or billions of humans….<br>
