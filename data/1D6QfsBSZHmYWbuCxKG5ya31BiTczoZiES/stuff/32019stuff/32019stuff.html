        <b>METHOD FOR PRODUCING WATER FROM AIR </b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      FIELD: agriculture.SUBSTANCE: invention relates to the field of
      autonomous production of fresh drinking water from the moisture of
      surrounding maritime atmospheric air and can also be used for
      domestic and economic needs. The method includes the use of
      generators (11) of pneumatic energy. The compressed air flow after
      the generators (11) is cooled in the condensers (6) with
      precipitation and moisture intake. Atmospheric air sampling is
      carried out in the vicinity of the sea surface, where its humidity
      is maximum. The generators (11) of pneumatic energy are actuated
      with the tidal energy. The generators (11) are made in the form of
      hydraulic units which are placed in the tidal zone ensuring the
      seawater banking in front of them. On the hydraulic units having
      radially movable walls in the form of membranes (1) the air
      compression chambers (3) with suction and discharge valves are
      mounted. In the hydraulic units the periodic hydraulic shock is
      initiated, which results in reciprocating motion of the membrane
      of the air compression chambers (3) and generating the pneumatic
      energy in the compression chambers (3). After the condensers (6)
      the air is directed to the air expanders made in the form of
      throttles or pneumatic motors (10). The pneumatic motors (10) are
      connected to the electric generators (11). The obtained electrical
      energy is used to drive the pumps (14) for pumping the settled
      fresh water from the condensers (6) and moisture-receivers (12) of
      the air expanders. When throttles are used as air expanders the
      fresh water is pumped from the moisture-receivers (12) by ejecting
      it with fresh water under pressure located in the condensers (6).
      The condensers of moisture (6) are placed under the sea level and
      cooled with sea water.EFFECT: conversion of hydraulic energy of
      sea tides into pneumatic energy necessary to extract the moisture
      contained in the atmospheric maritime air.<br>

          also play a role in rheumatoid arthritis</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Researchers from Johns Hopkins University have found a type of
      infectious bacteria that is taking over depleted microbiomes,
      which could trigger both severe gum disease and rheumatoid
      arthritis. They report that the bacteria Aggregatibacter
      actinomycetemcomitans are found in roughly 33 percent of people
      and are predominant in patients with periodontal disease and/or
      rheumatoid arthritis.<br>
      <br>
      The team found evidence that 47 percent of patients experiencing
      rheumatoid arthritis also were infected with the same bacterium
      that is causing their periodontal disease. At first, the
      researchers recognized a pattern of damage taking place in the
      gums of patients with periodontal disease similar to what’s seen
      in the joints of rheumatoid arthritis patients. In periodontal
      disease, the bacteria spurs the production of citrullinated
      proteins, which initiate an antibody response.<br>
      <br>
      The emergence of this bacterium elsewhere, in the joints, causes
      an inflammatory response with the body’s immune system. The
      bacterium causes cells called neutrophils to inflame the immune
      system, rendering a vicious auto-immune response. This causes
      conditions we recognize as rheumatoid arthritis, which can be felt
      as pain in the joints, or even inflammation around the heart and
      lungs. Dr. Felipe Andrade, a rheumatologist at Johns Hopkins who
      oversaw the research, said that while he and his team couldn’t
      figure out how the bacteria travel from the mouth to the joints,
      the connection was there...<br>

          mucosal immunity and chronic inflammatory and autoimmune
          diseases</b><br>
        <b>Helena Tlaskalová-Hogenová, et al.</b><br>
      </div>
      <b>Abstract</b><br>
      Commensal microflora (normal microflora, indigenous microbiota)
      consists of those micro-organisms, which are present on body
      surfaces covered by epithelial cells and are exposed to the
      external environment (gastrointestinal and respiratory tract,
      vagina, skin, etc.). The number of bacteria colonising mucosal and
      skin surfaces exceeds the number of cells forming human body.
      Commensal bacteria co-evolved with their hosts, however, under
      specific conditions they are able to overcome protective host
      responses and exert pathologic effects. Resident bacteria form
      complex ecosystems, whose diversity is enormous. The most abundant
      microflora is present in the distal parts of the gut; the majority
      of the intestinal bacteria are Gram-negative anaerobes. More than
      50% of intestinal bacteria cannot be cultured by conventional
      microbiological techniques. Molecular biological methods help in
      analysing the structural and functional complexity of the
      microflora and in identifying its components. Resident microflora
      contains a number of components able to activate innate and
      adaptive immunity. Unlimited immune activation in response to
      signals from commensal bacteria could pose the risk of
      inflammation; immune responses to mucosal microbiota therefore
      require a precise regulatory control. The mucosal immune system
      has developed specialised regulatory, anti-inflammatory mechanisms
      for eliminating or tolerating non-dangerous, food and airborne
      antigens and commensal micro-organisms (oral, mucosal tolerance).
      However, at the same time the mucosal immune system must provide
      local defense mechanisms against environmental threats (e.g.
      invading pathogens). This important requirement is fulfilled by
      several mechanisms of mucosal immunity: strongly developed innate
      defense mechanisms ensuring appropriate function of the mucosal
      barrier, existence of unique types of lymphocytes and their
      products, transport of polymeric immunoglobulins through
      epithelial cells into secretions (sIgA) and migration and homing
      of cells originating from the mucosal organised tissues in mucosae
      and exocrine glands.<br>
      <br>
      The important role of commensal bacteria in development of
      optimally functioning mucosal immune system was demonstrated in
      germ-free animals (using gnotobiological techniques). Involvement
      of commensal microflora and its components with strong
      immunoactivating properties (e.g. LPS, peptidoglycans,
      superantigens, bacterial DNA, Hsp) in etiopathogenetic mechanism
      of various complex, multifactorial and multigenic diseases,
      including inflammatory bowel diseases, periodontal disease,
      rheumatoid arthritis, atherosclerosis, allergy, multiorgan
      failure, colon cancer has been recently suggested. Animal models
      of human diseases reared in defined gnotobiotic conditions are
      helping to elucidate the aetiology of these frequent disorders. An
      improved understanding of commensal bacteria–host interactions
      employing germ-free animal models with selective colonisation
      strategies combined with modern molecular techniques could bring
      new insights into the mechanisms of mucosal immunity and also into
      pathogenetic mechanisms of several infectious, inflammatory,
      autoimmune and neoplastic diseases. Regulation of microflora
      composition (e.g. by probiotics and prebiotics) offers the
      possibility to influence the development of mucosal and systemic
      immunity but it can play a role also in prevention and treatment
      of some diseases.<br>

      <b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b><b>Introduction</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Excess sugar consumption has been linked with Alzheimer's disease
      (AD) pathology in animal models.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Methods</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      We examined the cross-sectional association of sugary beverage
      consumption with neuropsychological (N = 4276) and magnetic
      resonance imaging (N = 3846) markers of preclinical Alzheimer's
      disease and vascular brain injury (VBI) in the community-based
      Framingham Heart Study. Intake of sugary beverages was estimated
      using a food frequency questionnaire.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Results</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Relative to consuming less than one sugary beverage per day,
      higher intake of sugary beverages was associated with lower total
      brain volume (1–2/day, ß ± standard error [SE] = -0.55 ± 0.14 mean
      percent difference, P = .0002; &gt;2/day, ß ± SE = -0.68 ± 0.18, P
      &lt; .0001), and poorer performance on tests of episodic memory
      (all P &lt; .01). Daily fruit juice intake was associated with
      lower total brain volume, hippocampal volume, and poorer episodic
      memory (all P &lt; .05). Sugary beverage intake was not associated
      with VBI in a consistent manner across outcomes.<br>
      Discussion<br>
      <br>
      Higher intake of sugary beverages was associated cross-sectionally
      with markers of preclinical AD.<br>

      <b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b>Patients with skin penetrating titanium implants in the
      temporal bone, for attachment of bone-anchored hearing aids, have
      made it possible to investigate the free-damped natural
      frequencies (resonance frequencies) of the human skull in vivo.
      The resonance frequencies of the skull of six subjects were
      investigated. The resonance frequencies were extracted from two
      frequency response functions (acceleration/force) measured on each
      subject: One point measurement where the force and acceleration
      were both measured at the same point, and one transcranial
      measurement where the acceleration was measured contralaterally.
      Between 14 and 19 resonance frequencies were identified for each
      subject in the frequency range 500 Hz to 7.5 kHz. The two lowest
      resonance frequencies were found to be on the average 972 (range
      828-1164) and 1230 (range 981-1417) Hz. The relative damping
      coefficients of all resonances were found to be between 2.6 and
      8.9%. Due to the relatively high damping coefficients, it is
      assumed that the resonance frequencies do not significantly affect
      bone conducted sound. In the transcranial measurements, however, a
      few large antiresonances were found which may affect
      bone-conducted sound. Intersubject variations were large, probably
      due to individual variations in skull geometry and in mechanical
      parameters. The results were shown to be consistent with previous
      results obtained on dry skulls. No obvious correlation between
      lowest resonance frequency and skull size was found.<br>

      <b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b>A new computerized apparatus was constructed to measure the
      resonant frequency of human ulna in vivo with high sensitivity and
      reproducibility. Experimental studies using aluminum bar and dried
      human bone revealed the importance of the ulna being positioned
      parallel to the radius, approximately 90 degree flexion of the
      elbow joint, and minimal muscle activity in order to demonstrate
      maximum resonant frequency of ulna. Measurement of bone resonance
      in monkeys in vivo and after removal of the bone in vitro showed
      good agreement. Product of F (maximum resonant frequency in Hz)
      and L (ulnar length in cm), FL, indicating the speed of
      propagation of sound wave through the ulna, showed a significant
      positive correlation with bone mineral content/bone width (BM/BW)
      measured by Norland-Cameron apparatus and age-bound decline in
      both sexes. Patients with osteomalacia and primary
      hyperparathyroid bone disease tended to have higher FL values than
      expected from BM/BW. Two-dimensional display of FL and BM/BW thus
      appears to be useful in distinguishing osteoporosis from
      osteomalacia better than the use of BM/BW alone.<br>

      ...This is because 19Hz is the resonant frequency of the human
      eyeball. ... <br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;If you sit in front of a very good-quality subwoofer and
      play a 19Hz sound (or have access to a sound programmer and get an
      audible sound to modulate at 19Hz), try taking off your glasses or
      removing your contacts. Your eyes will twitch. If you turn up the
      volume so you start approaching 110 dB, you may even start seeing
      colored lights at the periphery of your vision or ghostly gray
      regions in the center. This is because 19Hz is the resonant
      frequency of the human eyeball. The low-frequency pulsations start
      distorting the eyeball's shape and pushing on the retina,
      activating the rods and cones by pressure rather than light.* This
      non-auditory effect may be the basis of some supernatural
      folklore. In 1998, Tony Lawrence and Vic Tandy wrote a paper for
      the Journal of the Society for Psychical Research (not my usual
      fare) called "Ghosts in the Machine," in which they describe how
      they got to the root of stories of a "haunted" laboratory. People
      in the lab had described seeing "ghostly" gray shapes that
      disappeared when they turned to face them. Upon examining the
      area, it turned out that a fan was resonating the room at 18.98Hz,
      almost exactly the resonant frequency of the human eyeball. When
      the fan was turned off, so did all stories of ghostly
      apparitions...<br>
      <br>
      A dry (i.e., removed from the body and on a table) human skull has
      prominent acoustic resonances at about 9 and 12kHz, slightly
      lesser ones at 14 and 17kHz, and even smaller ones at 32 and
      38kHz...<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;In fact, when a living human head was substituted for a dry
      skull in the same study, the 12kHz resonance peak was 70 dB lower,
      with the strongest resonance now at about 200Hz, and even that was
      30 dB lower than the highest resonance of the dry skull. You would
      probably have to use something on the order of a 240 dB source to
      get the head to resonate destructively.<br>

      <b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b>Human bodies are often exposed to vertical vibrations when
      they are in the workplace or on vehicles. Prolonged exposure may
      cause undue stress and discomfort in the human body especially at
      its resonant frequency. By testing the response of the human body
      on a vibrating platform, many researchers found the human
      whole-body fundamental resonant frequency to be around 5 Hz.
      However, in recent years, an indirect method has been prosed which
      appears to increase the resonant frequency to approximately 10 Hz.
      To explain this discrepancy, experimental work was carried out in
      NTU. The study shows that the discrepancy lies in the vibration
      magnitude used in the tests. A definition of human natural
      frequency in terms of vibration magnitude is proposed. <br>

      </b>...In 1992, Bruce Taino of Taino Technology, an independent
      division of Eastern State University in Cheny, Washington, built
      the first frequency monitor in the world. Taino has determined
      that the average frequency of a healthy human body during the
      daytime is 62 to 68 Hz.<br>
      <br>
      When the frequency drops, the immune system is compromised. If the
      frequency drops to 58 Hz, cold and flu symptoms appear; at 55 Hz,
      diseases like Candida take hold; at 52 Hz, Epstein Bar and at 42
      Hz, Cancer. Taino’s machine was certified as 100 percent accurate
      and is currently being used in the agricultural field today...<br>
      <br>
      "Processed or canned food has a frequency of zero and tends to
      lower healthy frequencies within the body towards degenerative
      diseases.”<br>
      <br>
      Fresh produce has up to 15 Hz; dry herbs from 12 to 22 Hz; and
      fresh herbs from 20 to 27 Hz. Essential oil frequencies start at
      52 Hz and go as high as 320 Hz; which is the frequency of Rose
      Oil. These higher frequencies create an environment in which
      disease, bacteria, virus, fungus, cancer, etc., CANNOT live.” In
      one study, the doctors took two young men who had a 66-hertz
      frequency. One held coffee and his frequency dropped to 58 in 3
      seconds. The other gentleman drank it and his frequency dropped to
      52 in 3 seconds.” Science Doesn’t Completely Understand How Cells
      and Frequencies Interact “Any influence of EMF on a living being

      <b>Abstract:</b><b><br>
      </b>Lateral and vertical wave-propagation velocities and natural
      frequencies of human hearts by shear wave (S-Wave) and compression
      wave (P-wave) increase with the increase in the volumes of blood
      and water in the heart, Poisson’s ratio, Young’s modulus; the
      volumes of oxygen, nitrogen and other gases; and with the decrease
      in the mass, thickness and the height of human heart,
      respectively. Human hearts have been considered as the mixtures of
      muscle, air and water (MAW) for the analyses. The lateral and
      vertical natural frequencies of cancerous hearts are found to be
      extremely low frequencies of 0.7 Hz (8.46%) and 1.5 Hz (8.46 %)
      compared with those of the normal people, respectively. Lateral
      and vertical heart-frequency indicators (HFIs) have been
      introduced in order to importantly stress and easily indicate the
      healthy level of the heart of each person in lateral and vertical
      directions, respectively. The higher the positive heart-frequency
      indicators, the more healthy heart of the person is.<br>

      </b><b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b>Graphene oxide membranes show exceptional molecular permeation
      properties, with promise for many applications1,2,3,4,5. However,
      their use in ion sieving and desalination technologies is limited
      by a permeation cutoff of ~9 Å (ref. 4), which is larger than the
      diameters of hydrated ions of common salts4,6. The cutoff is
      determined by the interlayer spacing (d) of ~13.5 Å, typical for
      graphene oxide laminates that swell in water2,4. Achieving smaller
      d for the laminates immersed in water has proved to be a
      challenge. Here, we describe how to control d by physical
      confinement and achieve accurate and tunable ion sieving.
      Membranes with d from ~9.8 Å to 6.4 Å are demonstrated, providing
      a sieve size smaller than the diameters of hydrated ions. In this
      regime, ion permeation is found to be thermally activated with

      <b>Inventor(s): JAMES JASPER L +</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Apparatus is disclosed including a compact thermionic generator
      formed with an outer cathode cylinder and an axially concentric
      inner anode cylinder. The cylinders are sealed and evacuated and
      provided with external electrical connections leading to the
      cathode and anode cylinders. A thermoelectric generator formed of
      a folded length of thermocouples is nested within the anode
      cylinder with respective ends thermically and electrically coupled
      to the cathode and anode cylinders. Sufficient heat applied to the
      outer cylinder causes the thermionic emission from the cathode to
      anode cylinders to be enhanced by the positive potential applied
      to the anode cylinder from the internal thermoelectric generator
      which is also responsive to the applied heat to generate the
      positive potential relative to the potential of the cathode
      cylinder. A generator system is also disclosed in which a pair of
      these generators is interconnected by a solid state switching
      circuit to an output load via intermediate charging capacitors.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF INVENTION</b><br>
      This invention relates to a combination thermionic-thermoelectric
      generator and more particularly to an apparatus and system which
      provides improved performance over prior known apparatus of this
      general type.<br>
      <br>
      Thermionic and thermoelectric generators are well known in the art
      to be capable of generating electric currents by the application
      of heat to the devices. In the case of thermionic generators,
      current is created by the emission of electrons from a surface
      which has been heated sufficiently to allow the electron energy to
      overcome the potential barrier energy level of the surface. The
      basic theory of thermionic energy conversion is discussed in U.S.
      Pat. No. 2,980,819--Feaster issued Apr. 18, 1961. One difficulty
      known to exist with converters of this type is the relatively low
      usuable potential that can be developed unless a relatively large
      number of converters are cascaded in series with consequent
      increase in bulk and cost. Also, converters that give usuable
      current levels generally require extremely close interelectrode
      spacing between the emitters and collector electrodes, generally
      on the order of one millimeter. The difficulty in achieving and
      maintaining such close spacing, particularly at the high
      temperatures, e.g. 1200 DEG C. required to have usable electron
      emission, has limited the commercial usefulness of thermionic
      converters to highly specialized applications.<br>
      <br>
      Thermoelectric converters, comprising a series of thermocouples,
      are also well known. In this device a current is generated by
      electron flow at the interface between the abutting surfaces of
      dissimilar materials maintained at different temperatures. By
      cascading a large number of these thermocouples, a thermopile can
      be produced which generates usable potential levels limited, in
      general, only by the practical length of the thermopile.<br>
      <br>
      In the past, a number of combined thermionic and thermoelectric
      generators have been proposed in which the two types of devices
      are packaged together and electrically connected at a common
      therminal so that the heat applied to the package causes both
      generators to develop current outputs, usually at separate output
      terminals. Examples of such devices are shown and described in
      U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,189,765 and 3,430,079 issued June 15, 1965, and
      Feb. 25, 1969, respectively.<br>
      <br>
      Despite the prior art which exists in this technology, it is
      believed that heretofore there has not existed a small, compack
      thermionic-thermoelectric generator apparatus capable of producing
      usable levels of current at usable potential levels. It is an
      object of this invention to provide a system embodying the
      improved apparatus with suitable switching circuits to furnish
      electrical current at usable potential levels to a load impedance.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      Thus in accordance with one aspect of the invention, there is
      provided thermionic-thermoelectric generator apparatus comprising
      a first elongated metallic cylindrical electrode having its
      internal surface coated with a thermionic electron emmissive
      material and a second elongated metallic cylindrical electrode
      nested coaxially within the first cylinder electrode, this second
      cylinder having at least the outer surface thereof coated with
      graphite to serve as a collector electrode for the electrons
      emitted from the first cylinder surface. Preferably the
      interelectrode spacing between the two cylinders is substantially
      uniform along the axial length thereof. The apparatus is further
      provided with a plurality ofthermopiles nested within the second
      cylinder, the thermopiles being electrically connected in series
      with one end consisting of electron donor material electrically
      coupled to the first cylinder, the other end consisting of
      electron acceptor material being electrically coupled to the
      second or inner cylinder. Means, such as sealable vacuum fittings
      are provided by which the outer cylinder may be evacuated and the
      vacuum maintained in the interelectrode space between the two
      cylinders. Means are also provided , such as at the end of the
      cylinders opposite the vacuum fitting, to provide external
      electrical connections from the cylinder electrodes to a load
      circuit.<br>
      <br>
      In the system of the invention, there is also included, with a
      pair of generators such as just described, circuit means for
      coupling in repetitive alternating sequence, each of the
      generators to output load terminals to provide a continuous
      electrical current flow to a load impedance connected to the load
      terminals.<br>

      ...By using different colours of probe and testing for
      combinations of separated segments, the team were able to verify
      it was extremely unlikely for a full complement of genetic
      segments to randomly end up inside any one cell.<br>
      <br>
      Yet that didn't seem to be preventing segments from being copied.
      This was true even for segments that weren't integral to the
      virus's most basic functions, such as replication, encapsidation,
      and movement within the host.<br>
      <br>
      "Altogether, we have shown that distinct segments of a virus's
      genome are not necessarily together within individual host cells,
      and that accumulation of one genome segment in a cell is entirely
      independent of accumulation of the others," says virologist
      Stéphane Blanc.<br>
      <br>
      The implications of the find suggest the products of one set of
      genetic instructions can have far-reaching influences, helping
      activate segments in other cells.<br>
      <br>
      The researchers found evidence for this hypothesis when they
      looked for the molecule encoded by the genome segment responsible
      for replication. While fewer than half of the plant's cells
      contained copies of this replication segment, nearly 85 percent of
      its cells contained its product.<br>
      <br>
      Strangely, this entire process more closely resembles the workings
      of a multicellular organism, with separate cells being forced to
      take on individualised tasks in the construction of a single
      virus...<br>

      </b><b>Abstract</b><br>
      A founding paradigm in virology is that the spatial unit of the
      viral replication cycle is an individual cell. Multipartite
      viruses have a segmented genome where each segment is encapsidated
      separately. In this situation the viral genome is not
      recapitulated in a single virus particle but in the viral
      population. How multipartite viruses manage to efficiently infect
      individual cells with all segments, thus with the whole genome
      information, is a long-standing but perhaps deceptive mystery. By
      localizing and quantifying the genome segments of a nanovirus in
      host plant tissues we show that they rarely co-occur within
      individual cells. We further demonstrate that distinct segments
      accumulate independently in different cells and that the viral
      system is functional through complementation across cells. Our
      observation deviates from the classical conceptual framework in
      virology and opens an alternative possibility (at least for
      nanoviruses) where the infection can operate at a level above the
      individual cell level, defining a viral multicellular way of life.<br>

      </b><b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b>Graphene oxide membranes show exceptional molecular permeation
      properties, with promise for many applications1,2,3,4,5. However,
      their use in ion sieving and desalination technologies is limited
      by a permeation cutoff of ~9 Å (ref. 4), which is larger than the
      diameters of hydrated ions of common salts4,6. The cutoff is
      determined by the interlayer spacing (d) of ~13.5 Å, typical for
      graphene oxide laminates that swell in water2,4. Achieving smaller
      d for the laminates immersed in water has proved to be a
      challenge. Here, we describe how to control d by physical
      confinement and achieve accurate and tunable ion sieving.
      Membranes with d from ~9.8 Å to 6.4 Å are demonstrated, providing
      a sieve size smaller than the diameters of hydrated ions. In this
      regime, ion permeation is found to be thermally activated with
      energy barriers of ~10–100 kJ mol–1 depending on d. Importantly,
      permeation rates decrease exponentially with decreasing sieve size
      but water transport is weakly affected (by a factor of &lt;2). The
      latter is attributed to a low barrier for the entry of water
      molecules and large slip lengths inside graphene capillaries.
      Building on these findings, we demonstrate a simple scalable
      method to obtain graphene-based membranes with limited swelling,
      which exhibit 97% rejection for NaCl.<br>

      ...By using different colours of probe and testing for
      combinations of separated segments, the team were able to verify
      it was extremely unlikely for a full complement of genetic
      segments to randomly end up inside any one cell.<br>
      <br>
      Yet that didn't seem to be preventing segments from being copied.
      This was true even for segments that weren't integral to the
      virus's most basic functions, such as replication, encapsidation,
      and movement within the host.<br>
      <br>
      "Altogether, we have shown that distinct segments of a virus's
      genome are not necessarily together within individual host cells,
      and that accumulation of one genome segment in a cell is entirely
      independent of accumulation of the others," says virologist
      Stéphane Blanc.<br>
      <br>
      The implications of the find suggest the products of one set of
      genetic instructions can have far-reaching influences, helping
      activate segments in other cells.<br>
      <br>
      The researchers found evidence for this hypothesis when they
      looked for the molecule encoded by the genome segment responsible
      for replication. While fewer than half of the plant's cells
      contained copies of this replication segment, nearly 85 percent of
      its cells contained its product.<br>
      <br>
      Strangely, this entire process more closely resembles the workings
      of a multicellular organism, with separate cells being forced to
      take on individualised tasks in the construction of a single
      virus...<br>

      </b><b>Abstract</b><br>
      A founding paradigm in virology is that the spatial unit of the
      viral replication cycle is an individual cell. Multipartite
      viruses have a segmented genome where each segment is encapsidated
      separately. In this situation the viral genome is not
      recapitulated in a single virus particle but in the viral
      population. How multipartite viruses manage to efficiently infect
      individual cells with all segments, thus with the whole genome
      information, is a long-standing but perhaps deceptive mystery. By
      localizing and quantifying the genome segments of a nanovirus in
      host plant tissues we show that they rarely co-occur within
      individual cells. We further demonstrate that distinct segments
      accumulate independently in different cells and that the viral
      system is functional through complementation across cells. Our
      observation deviates from the classical conceptual framework in
      virology and opens an alternative possibility (at least for
      nanoviruses) where the infection can operate at a level above the
      individual cell level, defining a viral multicellular way of life.<br>

      </b>Materials science specialists from the National University of
      Science and Technology MISIS (NUST MISIS), have developed a unique
      three-layer steel-vanadium-steel material that can withstand
      temperatures of up to 700 degrees Celsius for prolonged periods,
      as well as high radiation levels, mechanical stress and aggressive
      chemicals...<br>
      <br>
      "Our team has developed the sandwich-type three-layer
      steel-vanadium alloy-steel material whose ferritic stainless steel
      ensures substantial corrosion resistance. And the material's
      vanadium alloy (V-4Ti-4Cr) guarantees heat and radiation
      resistance, so as to offset the impact of a nuclear reactor's
      super-aggressive environment," said project co-author and
      postgraduate student Alexandra Baranova from NUST MISIS' Faculty
      of Materials Science and Physics of High-Strength Materials.<br>
      <br>
      According to Baranova, the creation of this composite material is
      a formidable challenge because both materials must be as
      monolithic as possible at various seams and joints.<br>
      <br>
      "It became possible to solve this problem by using a complicated
      deformation-thermal method for treating the three-layer blanks
      that includes hot co-extrusion, radial forging and joint rolling.
      This creates a ‘transitional zone' on the boundary between the
      component materials. Therefore the materials diffuse into each
      other, and this guarantees their highly durable seams and joints,"
      Baranova noted.<br>
      <br>
      This production process allowed steel and the vanadium alloy to
      penetrate each other, scientists said. Members of the research
      team managed to develop a prototype rod enclosure which is, in
      fact, a monolithic three-layer tube.<br>
      <br>
      Laboratory tests proved the new alloy's high durability at working
      temperatures of up to 700 degrees Celsius. Developers are set to
      launch a long-term project for assessing the new material's
      radiation-resistance levels soon.<br>

      Researchers from the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology
      teamed up with colleagues from the U.S. and Switzerland and
      returned the state of a quantum computer a fraction of a second
      into the past. They also calculated the probability that an
      electron in empty interstellar space will spontaneously travel
      back into its recent past. The study is published in Scientific
      Reports.<br>
      <br>
      "This is one in a series of papers on the possibility of violating
      the second law of thermodynamics. That law is closely related to
      the notion of the arrow of time that posits the one-way direction
      of time from the past to the future," said the study's lead author
      Gordey Lesovik, who heads the Laboratory of the Physics of Quantum
      Information Technology at MIPT.<br>
      <br>
      "We began by describing a so-called local perpetual motion machine
      of the second kind. Then, in December, we published a paper that
      discusses the violation of the second law via a device called a
      Maxwell's demon," Lesovik said. "The most recent paper approaches
      the same problem from a third angle: We have artificially created
      a state that evolves in a direction opposite to that of the
      thermodynamic arrow of time."<br>

          a Row</b><br>
        <b>by Dr. Tony Phillips</b><br>
      </div>
      Cosmic rays in the stratosphere are intensifying for the 4th year
      in a row.<br>
      <br>
      This finding comes from a campaign of almost weekly high-altitude
      balloon launches conducted by the students of Earth to Sky
      Calculus.<br>
      <br>
      Since March 2015, there has been a ~13% increase in X-rays and
      gamma-rays over central California, where the students have
      launched hundreds of balloons.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      The grey points in the graph are Earth to Sky balloon data.<br>
      <br>
      Overlaid on that time series is a record of neutron monitor data
      from the Sodankyla Geophysical Observatory in Oulu, Finland. The
      correlation between the two data sets is impressive, especially
      considering their wide geographic separation and differing
      methodologies.<br>
      <b><br>
      </b>Neutron monitors have long been considered a "gold standard"
      for monitoring cosmic rays on Earth. This shows that our
      student-built balloons are gathering data of similar quality.<br>
      <br>
      Why are cosmic rays increasing? The short answer is "Solar
      Minimum"...<br>
      <br>
      Right now, the 11-year solar cycle is plunging into one of the
      deepest minima of the Space Age. The sun's weakening magnetic
      field and flagging solar wind are not protecting us as usual from
      deep-space radiation.<br>
      <br>
      Earth to Sky balloon launches in multiple countries and .S. states
      show that this is a widespread phenomenon.<br>
      <br>
      Cosmic rays are of interest to anyone who flies on airplanes.<br>
      <br>
      The International Commission on Radiological Protection has
      classified pilots as occupational radiation workers because of
      cosmic ray doses they receive while flying.<br>
      <br>
      A recent study (Cancer Prevalence among Flight Attendants compared
      to the General Population) by researchers at the Harvard School of
      Public Health shows that flight attendants face an elevated risk
      of cancer compared to members of the general population.<br>
      <br>
      They listed cosmic rays as one of several risk factors.<br>
      <br>
      There are also controversial studies that suggest cosmic rays
      promote the formation of clouds in the atmosphere; if so,
      increasing cosmic rays could affect weather and climate.<br>

      Science and Technology MISIS (NUST MISIS), have developed a unique
      three-layer steel-vanadium-steel material that can withstand
      temperatures of up to 700 degrees Celsius for prolonged periods,
      as well as high radiation levels, mechanical stress and aggressive
      chemicals...<br>
      <br>
      "Our team has developed the sandwich-type three-layer
      steel-vanadium alloy-steel material whose ferritic stainless steel
      ensures substantial corrosion resistance. And the material's
      vanadium alloy (V-4Ti-4Cr) guarantees heat and radiation
      resistance, so as to offset the impact of a nuclear reactor's
      super-aggressive environment," said project co-author and
      postgraduate student Alexandra Baranova from NUST MISIS' Faculty
      of Materials Science and Physics of High-Strength Materials.<br>
      <br>
      According to Baranova, the creation of this composite material is
      a formidable challenge because both materials must be as
      monolithic as possible at various seams and joints.<br>
      <br>
      "It became possible to solve this problem by using a complicated
      deformation-thermal method for treating the three-layer blanks
      that includes hot co-extrusion, radial forging and joint rolling.
      This creates a ‘transitional zone' on the boundary between the
      component materials. Therefore the materials diffuse into each
      other, and this guarantees their highly durable seams and joints,"
      Baranova noted.<br>
      <br>
      This production process allowed steel and the vanadium alloy to
      penetrate each other, scientists said. Members of the research
      team managed to develop a prototype rod enclosure which is, in
      fact, a monolithic three-layer tube.<br>
      <br>
      Laboratory tests proved the new alloy's high durability at working
      temperatures of up to 700 degrees Celsius. Developers are set to
      launch a long-term project for assessing the new material's
      radiation-resistance levels soon.<br>

        <i>UCI chemists create battery technology with off-the-charts
          charging capacity</i><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      &nbsp;University of California, Irvine researchers have invented
      nanowire-based battery material that can be recharged hundreds of
      thousands of times, moving us closer to a battery that would never
      require replacement. The breakthrough work could lead to
      commercial batteries with greatly lengthened lifespans for
      computers, smartphones, appliances, cars and spacecraft.<br>
      <br>
      Scientists have long sought to use nanowires in batteries.
      Thousands of times thinner than a human hair, they’re highly
      conductive and feature a large surface area for the storage and
      transfer of electrons. However, these filaments are extremely
      fragile and don’t hold up well to repeated discharging and
      recharging, or cycling. In a typical lithium-ion battery, they
      expand and grow brittle, which leads to cracking.<br>
      <br>
      UCI researchers have solved this problem by coating a gold
      nanowire in a manganese dioxide shell and encasing the assembly in
      an electrolyte made of a Plexiglas-like gel. The combination is
      reliable and resistant to failure.<br>
      <br>
      The study leader, UCI doctoral candidate Mya Le Thai, cycled the
      testing electrode up to 200,000 times over three months without
      detecting any loss of capacity or power and without fracturing any
      nanowires. The findings were published today in the American
      Chemical Society’s Energy Letters.<br>
      <br>
      Hard work combined with serendipity paid off in this case,
      according to senior author Reginald Penner.<br>
      <br>
      “Mya was playing around, and she coated this whole thing with a
      very thin gel layer and started to cycle it,” said Penner, chair
      of UCI’s chemistry department. “She discovered that just by using
      this gel, she could cycle it hundreds of thousands of times
      without losing any capacity.”<br>
      <br>
      “That was crazy,” he added, “because these things typically die in
      dramatic fashion after 5,000 or 6,000 or 7,000 cycles at most.”<br>
      <br>
      The researchers think the goo plasticizes the metal oxide in the
      battery and gives it flexibility, preventing cracking.<br>
      <br>
      “The coated electrode holds its shape much better, making it a
      more reliable option,” Thai said. “This research proves that a
      nanowire-based battery electrode can have a long lifetime and that
      we can make these kinds of batteries a reality.”<br>
      <br>
      The study was conducted in coordination with the Nanostructures
      for Electrical Energy Storage Energy Frontier Research Center at
      the University of Maryland, with funding from the Basic Energy
      Sciences division of the U.S. Department of Energy.<br>

        <b>ENHANCED CYCLE LIFETIME WITH GEL ELECTROLYTE FOR MNO2
          NANOWIRE CAPACITORS<br>
          <br>
        </b></div>
      <b>Inventor(s): &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PENNER REGINALD, et al.</b><br>
      A nanowire energy storage device such as a nanowire battery or a
      capacitor having a cathode comprising a plurality of nanowires and
      an anode comprising a plurality of nanowires interlaced with the
      plurality of nanowires of the cathode, and embedded in a PMMA gel
      electrolyte.<br>
      <b><br>
        BACKGROUND<br>
      </b><br>
      [0003] The nanowire morphology can enable higher power in either
      batteries or capacitors than is possible using a film of the same
      material. The drawback of such nanowires for energy storage is
      cycle stability. For example, the capacitors operating in
      propylene carbonate (PC) 1.0 M LiClO4 show dramatically reduced
      cycle stabilities ranging from 2,000-8,000 cycles. In the piqued
      PC electrolyte, the d-MnO2 shell fractures, delaminates, and
      separates from the gold nanowire current collector. The diminutive
      lateral dimension of nanowires increases their susceptibility to
      dissolution and corrosion and these processes rapidly result in a
      loss of electrical continuity through the nanowire and an
      irreversible loss of capacity.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] Therefore, it is desirable to provide systems and methods
      that facilitate the expansion of cycle stability for
      nanowire-based energy storage devices.<br>
      <b><br>
        SUMMARY<br>
      </b><br>
      [0005] The various embodiments provided herein are generally
      directed to systems and methods that facilitate reversible cycle
      stability for nanowire-based storage devices such as batteries and
      capacitors. For symmetrical d-MnO2 nanowire-based storage devices
      such as batteries and capacitors operating across a 1.2 V voltage
      window in a poly(methylmethacrylate)-PMMA gel electrolyte the
      reversible cycle stability increased up to 200,000 cycles with
      94-96% average coulombic efficiency. The high viscosity and
      elasticity of the PMMA gel tends to prevent separation of MNO2
      from the current collector while remaining transparent to fluxes
      of Li+ involved in insertion and de-insertion. The deleterious
      processes are not observed in the PMMA electrolyte.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] Embodiments of the present disclosure also relate to a 3D
      nanowire capacitor, comprising stacked, planar 2D nanowire layers
      separated by thin PMMA gel electrolyte layers, operating across a
      1.8 V voltage window. Such two-layer capacitors produce ultra-high
      cycle stability—to 100,000 cycles—also observed for single layers
      of nanowires operating in a PMMA gel electrolyte disclosed herein.
      The “sandwich” capacitor architecture disclosed herein includes
      two 4000 nanowire layers separated by a very thin 2 µm layer of
      PMMA gel electrolyte. This sandwich capacitor can be thought of as
      a “unit cell” of a many-layered, 3D capacitor comprising tens or
      hundreds of planar nanowire layers, spaced by micron-scale PMMA
      gel electrolyte layers. <br>

      be purified if it is kept in a room where Agnihotrais regularly
      performed. Water purification also happens if water bottles are
      kept inside a Faraday Cage in the Agnihotra room. These results
      suggest that Agnihotra creates an energy field beyond the

          Traditional Medical Knowledge</b><br>
        <b>Rahul RaveendranNair</b><br>
      </div>
      <b>Abstract</b><br>
      This study conceptualizes the principle of agnihotra yajna. The
      perusal of ancient and modern literature reveals that the
      functioning of the human body is impossible without maintaining an
      energetic continuum driven by sunlight. The seven major chakras
      existing over the spinal cord help to maintain this energetic
      continuum. Agnihotra yajna is proposed to balance the chakra
      system as a whole by minimizing entropy. Offerings of natural
      elements to fire lit in a copper pyramid during agnihotra liberate
      various volatile compounds having potent pharmacological actions.
      Attempts were made to enhance the efficacy of fumes by
      incorporating two to three pieces of coconut endosperm and
      “navadhanya” (nine grains) to the conventional fire oblations.
      This investigation clearly demonstrates that the purpose behind
      the practice of agnihotra yajna is “letting incessant flow of
      energy (LIFE)” through our meridian lines and acupuncture points.
      The volatile organic compounds in smoke were analyzed using the
      gas chromatography–mass spectrometry method, and the results are
      discussed.<br>

      to 10 weeks with minimal side effects, allowing them to see
      infrared light even during the day and with enough specificity to
      distinguish between different shapes. These findings could lead to

      A recently discovered Weyl semimetal delivers the largest
      intrinsic conversion of light to electricity of any material, an
      international team lead by a group of Boston College researchers
      reports today in the journal Nature Materials.<br>
      <br>
      The discovery is based on a unique aspect of the material where
      electrons can be separated by their chirality, or
      handedness—similar to DNA. The findings may offer a new route to
      efficient generation of electricity from light, as well as for
      thermal or chemical sensing. <br>
      <br>
      "We discovered that the Weyl semimetal Tantalum Arsenide, has a
      colossal bulk photovoltaic effect—an intrinsic, or non-linear,
      generation of current from light more than ten times larger than
      ever previously achieved," said Boston College Associate Professor
      of Physics Kenneth Burch, a lead author of the article, titled
      "Colossal mid-infrared bulk photovoltaic effect in a type-I Weyl
      semimetal."<br>
      <br>
      "Furthermore this is in the mid-infrared regime, which means this
      material can also be used for chemical or thermal sensing, as well
      as waste heat recovery," Burch added.<br>
      <br>
      Typically, light is converted to electricity by creating a
      built-in electric field in a semiconductor, Burch said. "This is
      achieved through chemical modulation, and results in a fundamental
      upper limit to the potential efficiency—known as the
      Shockley-Queisser limit."<br>
      <br>
      The alternative approach taken by the team explored exploiting the
      handedness of the electrons in the material to intrinsically
      generate direct current through the nonlinear mixing of the waves
      of light, Burch said.<br>
      <br>
      This approach has typically been too small to be useful. But
      researchers recently realized it is closely connected to the
      topological properties of the electrons. That prompted predictions
      that the unique, DNA-like behavior of electrons in Weyl semimetals
      could produce enormous nonlinear effects.<br>
      <br>
      "We focused on answering whether Weyl semimetals live up to the
      predictions of large, intrinsic nonlinear responses to generate
      current," said Burch, co-author of the paper with Philip Moll of
      Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne, and Ni Ni of UCLA.<br>
      <br>
      He added that the team was surprised at the magnitude of the
      electronic effect, which was provoked by a new fabrication
      approach.<br>
      <br>
      "The size of the effect was far larger than we dreamed," said
      Burch. "A previous group from MIT found their response was
      dominated by thermal, or extrinsic, terms, our use of the focused
      ion beam fabricated devices and symmetry allowed us to uncover the
      colossal bulk photovoltaic effect at room temperature."<br>
      <br>
      Burch said the team is working to determine the "sweet spot" for
      the effect, specifically what is the ideal device configuration
      and wavelength of light.<br>

          through Injectable and Self-Powered Retinal Nanoantennae</b><br>
        <b>Yuqian Ma, et al.</b><br>
      </div>
      <b>Summary</b><b><br>
      </b>Mammals cannot see light over 700 nm in wavelength. This
      limitation is due to the physical thermodynamic properties of the
      photon-detecting opsins. However, the detection of naturally
      invisible near-infrared (NIR) light is a desirable ability. To
      break this limitation, we developed ocular injectable
      photoreceptor-binding upconversion nanoparticles (pbUCNPs). These
      nanoparticles anchored on retinal photoreceptors as miniature NIR
      light transducers to create NIR light image vision with negligible
      side effects. Based on single-photoreceptor recordings,
      electroretinograms, cortical recordings, and visual behavioral
      tests, we demonstrated that mice with these nanoantennae could not
      only perceive NIR light, but also see NIR light patterns.
      Excitingly, the injected mice were also able to differentiate
      sophisticated NIR shape patterns. Moreover, the NIR light pattern
      vision was ambient-daylight compatible and existed in parallel
      with native daylight vision. This new method will provide
      unmatched opportunities for a wide variety of emerging
      bio-integrated nanodevice designs and applications.<br>

      A study just published in the journal Nature Geoscience shows that
      if we continue with business-as-usual fossil fuel emissions, the
      atmosphere will hold 1,200 parts per million CO2 in about a
      century from now, which will cause stratocumulus clouds to
      disappear. Their absence could leave the Earth to warm by a
      staggering 8 degrees Celsius (8°C).<br>
      <br>
      The computer simulation used in the study showed that once that
      1,200 parts per million (ppm) tipping point of atmospheric CO2 is
      breached, the Earth’s temperature would soar by 4°C just from the
      CO2. Then, it would increase by another 4°C due to the absent
      clouds no longer reflecting solar radiation back into space.<br>
      <br>
      Stratocumulus clouds cover around two-thirds of the planet, and
      play a key role in keeping the planet cool, due to their white
      color and reflective qualities. Research has shown that planetary
      warming correlates with the loss of clouds. This is yet another
      unforeseen climate feedback loop that could catapult us into
      catastrophic warming.<br>
      <br>
      Kerry Emanuel, a climate scientist at the Massachusetts Institute
      of Technology who is a leading authority on atmospheric physics,
      told Quanta Magazine that the results of the study still needed to
      be replicated independently, but that the possibility of the
      simulation being accurate was “very plausible.”...<br>

      <br>
      Case Western Reserve researchers observe waves ‘leap’ across cut
      in brain tissue; ‘ephaptic coupling’ said to be producing
      self-propagating waves unknown until now<br>
      <br>
      Biomedical engineering researchers at Case Western Reserve
      University say they have identified a previously unidentified form
      of neural communication, a discovery that could help scientists
      better understand neural activity surrounding specific brain
      processes and brain disorders.<br>
      <br>
      “We don’t know yet the ‘So what?’ part of this discovery
      entirely,” said lead researcher Dominique Durand, the Elmer
      Lincoln Lindseth Professor in Biomedical Engineering and director
      of the Neural Engineering Center at the Case School of
      Engineering. “But we do know that this seems to be an entirely new
      form of communication in the brain, so we are very excited about
      this.”<br>
      <br>
      Until now, there were three known ways that neurons “talk” to each
      other in the brain: via synaptic transmission, axonal transmission
      and what are known as “gap junctions” between the neurons.<br>
      <br>
      Scientists have also known, however, that when many neurons fire
      together they generate weak electric fields that can be recorded
      with the electroencephalogram (EEG). But these fields were thought
      to be too small to contribute to neural activity.<br>
      <br>
      These new experiments in Durand’s laboratory, however, have shown
      that not only can these fields excite cells, but that they can
      produce electric fields of their own and generate a
      self-propagating wave of activity.<br>
      <br>
      This newly found form of communication was discovered while
      scientists at Case Western Reserve were analyzing the propagation
      mechanism of relatively fast brain waves similar to those
      generated when we sleep. They call it ephaptic (or electric)
      coupling, a reference to the known and observed low-level electric
      field in the brain—but now believed to also be capable of
      generating neural activity.<br>
      <br>
      “We’ve known about these waves for a long time, but no one knows
      their exact function and no one believed they could spontaneously
      propagate,” Durand said. “I’ve been studying the hippocampus,
      itself just one small part of the brain, for 40 years and it keeps
      surprising me.”<br>
      Stunning experiment<br>
      <br>
      That surprise peaked during a series of experiments in which
      Durand and his team observed a wave “leap” across a cut they had
      made in brain tissue slice—a phenomenon they conclude could only
      be explained by the electric field coupling.<br>
      <br>
      Again and again, the brain-wave appeared to jump across the empty
      gap. Picture a stadium fan “wave” as it hits the empty bleachers
      in center-field. You expect the wave to sputter out, but it gets
      picked up again by the crowd in right-field and keeps coursing
      through the crowd.<br>
      <br>
      Except this was wave behavior in a neural tissue that had never
      been reported before by neuroscientists, or anyone else, the
      scientists said.<br>
      <br>
      Durand said he didn’t believe it when he saw it. Neither did the
      fellow researchers in his lab or a partner at Tianjin University
      in China.<br>
      <br>
      “It was a jaw-dropping moment,” he said, “for us and for every
      scientist we told about this so far.”<br>
      <br>
      Among the dubious: The review committee at The Journal of
      Physiology, which required the researchers from Case Western
      Reserve to perform further experiments to double- and triple-check
      their work before agreeing to publish the work.<br>
      <br>
      “But every experiment we’ve done since to test it has confirmed it
      so far,” Durand said.<br>
      <br>
      The team’s paper on the discovery was published in the October
      issue of the journal.<br>

      <div align="center"><b>CT Scans Reveal Acupuncture Points </b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      CT scans reveal anatomical structures of acupuncture points. This
      new finding demonstrates the physical existence of acupuncture
      points. A CT (computerized tomography) scan is a series of X-rays
      used to create cross-sectional images. In this study published in
      the Journal of Electron Spectroscopy and Related Phenomena,
      researchers used in-line phase contrast CT imaging with
      synchrotron radiation on both non-acupuncture points and
      acupuncture points. The CT scans revealed clear distinctions
      between the non-acupuncture point and acupuncture point anatomical
      structures.<br>
      <br>
      Acupuncture points have a higher density of micro-vessels and
      contain a large amount of involuted microvascular structures. The
      non-acupuncture points did not exhibit these properties.<br>
      <br>
      The researchers note that the state-of-the-art CT imaging
      techniques used in this study allow for improved three-dimensional
      (3D) imaging of a large field of view without artifacts. This
      greatly improves imaging of soft tissue and allowed the
      researchers to make this important discovery.<br>
      <br>
      The acupuncture points ST36 (Zusanli) and ST37 (Shangjuxu) were
      shown to have very distinct structural differences than
      surrounding areas. At the acupuncture points, microvascular
      densities with bifurcations “can be clearly seen around thick
      blood vessels” but non-acupuncture point areas showed few thick
      blood vessels and none showed fine, high density structures. The
      acupuncture points contained fine structures with more large blood
      vessels that are several dozen micrometers in size plus beds of
      high density vascularization of vessels 15-50 micrometers in size.
      This structure was not found in non-acupuncture point areas.<br>
      <br>
      The researchers note that the size of an acupuncture point “can be
      estimated by the diameter of microvascular aggregations….” They
      also commented that other research has found unique structures of
      acupuncture points and acupuncture meridians using MRI (magnetic
      resonance imaging), infrared imaging, LCD thermal photography,
      ultrasound and other CT imaging methods. The researchers commented
      that many studies using these technological approaches have
      already shown that acupuncture points exist. They note that “the
      high brightness, wide spectrum, high collimation, polarization and
      pulsed structure of synchrotron radiation” facilitated their
      discovery. They concluded, “Our results demonstrated again the
      existence of acupoints, and also show that the acupoints are
      special points in mammals.”<br>
      <br>
      In another interesting study, researchers used an amperometric
      oxygen microsensor to detect partial oxygen pressure variations at
      different locations on the anterior aspect of the wrist. The
      researchers concluded that partial oxygen pressure is
      significantly higher at acupuncture points. Below are images from
      the study measuring the increase of partial oxygen pressure
      combined with an overlay of the local acupuncture point locations.
      The images map the Lung, Pericardium and Heart channels and their
      associated local points. Acupuncture points P7 and P6 clearly show
      high oxygen pressure levels as do the other acupuncture points in
      the region.<br>
      <br>
      These measurements are not needled points but are natural resting
      states of acupuncture points absent stimulation. A truly unique
      finding, acupuncture points exhibit special oxygen
      characteristics. Acupuncture points and acupuncture channels are
      scientifically measurable phenomena in repeated experiments.<br>

      </b><b>Abstract</b><br>
      Slow oscillations are a standard feature observed in the cortex
      and the hippocampus during slow wave sleep. Slow oscillations are
      characterized by low-frequency periodic activity (&lt;1 Hz) and
      are thought to be related to memory consolidation. These waves are
      assumed to be a reflection of the underlying neural activity, but
      it is not known if they can, by themselves, be self-sustained and
      propagate. Previous studies have shown that slow periodic activity
      can be reproduced in the in vitro preparation to mimic in vivo
      slow oscillations. Slow periodic activity can propagate with
      speeds around 0.1 m s-1 and be modulated by weak electric fields.
      In the present study, we show that slow periodic activity in the
      longitudinal hippocampal slice is a self-regenerating wave which
      can propagate with and without chemical or electrical synaptic
      transmission at the same speeds. We also show that applying local
      extracellular electric fields can modulate or even block the
      propagation of this wave in both in silico and in vitro models.
      Our results support the notion that ephaptic coupling plays a
      significant role in the propagation of the slow hippocampal
      periodic activity. Moreover, these results indicate that a neural
      network can give rise to sustained self-propagating waves by
      ephaptic coupling, suggesting a novel propagation mechanism for
      neural activity under normal physiological conditions.<br>

        <b>by Azriel ReShel </b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      ...Recently scientists at Seoul National University confirmed the
      existence of meridians, which they refer to as the “primo-vascular
      system.” They say that this system is a crucial part of the
      cardiovascular system.<br>
      <br>
      Previously, North Korean scientist Kim Bong-Han proposed that he
      had found meridians in the early 1960’s.&nbsp; Dr Kim Bong-Han
      showed over 50 years ago that new tubular structures exist inside
      and outside of blood vessels and lymphatic vessels, as well as on
      the surface of internal organs and under the dermis. He believed
      they were the traditional meridian lines. The meridians were
      called Bonghan ducts or channels, after his research, but now the
      existence of this system in various organs has been corroborated
      by further research.<br>
      <br>
      The current Korean researchers now believe the primo-vascular
      system is in fact the physical component of the Acupuncture
      Meridian System. And it has also been suggested that this system
      is involved in channelling the flow of energy and information
      relayed by biophotons (electromagnetic waves of light) and DNA.<br>
      <br>
      The Korean scientists studying oriental medicine with biophysical
      methods injected a special staining dye which coloured the
      meridians. By injecting the dye onto acupuncture points, they were
      able to see thin lines. These did not show up at non-acupuncture
      point sites where there are no meridians. The researchers
      discovered that the meridian lines are not confined to the skin,
      but are in fact a concrete duct system through which liquid flows,
      and that this liquid aggregates to form stem cells.<br>
      <br>
      Previously, scientists used a combination of imaging techniques
      and CT scans to observe concentrated points of microvascular
      structures that clearly correspond to the map of acupuncture
      points created by Chinese energy practitioners in ancient times.
      In a study published in the Journal of Electron Spectroscopy and
      Related Phenomena, researchers used contrast CT imaging with
      radiation on both non-acupuncture points and acupuncture points.
      The CT scans revealed clear distinctions between the
      non-acupuncture point and acupuncture point anatomical structures.<br>

        <b>Danko D.Georgieva, James F.Glazebrook</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Twenty five years ago, Sir John Carew Eccles together with
      Friedrich Beck proposed a quantum mechanical model of
      neurotransmitter release at synapses in the human cerebral cortex.
      The model endorsed causal influence of human consciousness upon
      the functioning of synapses in the brain through quantum tunneling
      of unidentified quasiparticles that trigger the exocytosis of
      synaptic vesicles, thereby initiating the transmission of
      information from the presynaptic towards the postsynaptic neuron.
      Here, we provide a molecular upgrade of the Beck and Eccles model
      by identifying the quantum quasiparticles as Davydov solitons that
      twist the protein a-helices and trigger exocytosis of synaptic
      vesicles through helical zipping of the SNARE protein complex. We
      also calculate the observable probabilities for exocytosis based
      on the mass of this quasiparticle, along with the characteristics
      of the potential energy barrier through which tunneling is
      necessary. We further review the current experimental evidence in
      support of this novel bio-molecular model as presented.<br>

          Blumenthal tours Caracas supermarket (VIDEO) </b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      &nbsp;Corporate media grieve for the barren shelves and empty
      bellies in Venezuela, but are the alleged food shortages real?
      After touring a supermarket in Caracas, Max Blumenthal found
      plenty to buy – even craft beer.<br>
      <br>
      “Grocery shelves lie empty as food becomes increasingly scarce” in
      Venezuela, the UK Independent weeps. The country’s shops remain
      open but “sparsely stocked,” The Guardian laments. Even “basic
      commodities” such as toothbrushes aren’t available for purchase,
      CNN bemoans. “Hungry” Venezuelans must choose between “torture or
      starvation,” Bloomberg grimly concludes. Mainstream media coverage
      of Venezuela gives the impression that President Nicolas Maduro is
      slowly starving his own people – a narrative which, as journalist
      Max Blumenthal found after surveying a massive supermarket in
      Caracas, is wildly deceptive.<br>
      <br>
      The store offered a wide selection of meat, produce, and dairy
      (although no low-fat Greek yogurt, an indignity which is likely
      the result of Maduro’s tyrannical ways, Blumenthal jokingly
      hypothesizes). Most importantly, craft beer – a hallmark of heroic
      consumerism – could be found in the supermarket’s alcohol aisle.<br>
      <br>
      Blumenthal also marveled at the store’s huge variety of scented
      toilet paper, shampoo and toiletries – the “basic commodities”
      which, according to CNN, are nowhere to be found in Venezuela.<br>
      <br>
      “There isn’t an issue here with food distribution or food
      scarcity,” Blumenthal concludes. “The issue is the buying power of
      Venezuelans has been completely destroyed because their currency
      has been so badly weakened by hyperinflation, speculation and the
      flood of dollars that the government can’t control here, as well
      as hoarding by private capitalist elements that support the
      opposition.”<br>

      </div>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the pervasive use of smartphones that
      sense, collect, and process valuable information about the
      environment, ensuring location privacy has become one of the most
      important concerns in the modern age. A few recent research
      studies discuss the feasibility of processing data gathered by a
      smartphone to locate the phone's owner, even when the user does
      not intend to share his location information, e.g., when the
      Global Positioning System (GPS) is off. Previous research efforts
      rely on at least one of the two following fundamental
      requirements, which significantly limit the ability of the
      adversary: (i) the attacker must accurately know either the user's
      initial location or the set of routes through which the user
      travels and/or (ii) the attacker must measure a set of features,
      e.g., the device's acceleration, for potential routes in advance
      and construct a training dataset. In this paper, we demonstrate
      that neither of the above-mentioned requirements is essential for
      compromising the user's location privacy. We describe PinMe, a
      novel user-location mechanism that exploits non-sensory/sensory
      data stored on the smartphone, e.g., the environment's air
      pressure, along with publicly-available auxiliary information,
      e.g., elevation maps, to estimate the user's location when all
      location services, e.g., GPS, are turned off. <br>

          geometry, researchers find </b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      The connection between music and mathematics has fascinated
      scholars for centuries. More than 200 years ago Pythagoras
      reportedly discovered that pleasing musical intervals could be
      described using simple ratios.<br>
      <br>
      The method, according to its authors, allows them to analyze and
      compare many kinds of Western (and perhaps some non-Western)
      music. (The method focuses on Western-style music because concepts
      like "chord" are not universal in all styles.) It also
      incorporates many past schemes by music theorists to render music
      into mathematical form...<br>
      <br>
      The trio describes five different ways of categorizing collections
      of notes that are similar, but not identical. They refer to these
      musical resemblances as the "OPTIC symmetries," with each letter
      of the word "OPTIC" representing a different way of ignoring
      musical information -- for instance, what octave the notes are in,
      their order, or how many times each note is repeated. The authors
      show that five symmetries can be combined with each other to
      produce a cornucopia of different musical concepts, some of which
      are familiar and some of which are novel.<br>
      In this way, the musicians are able to reduce musical works to
      their mathematical essence...<br>

      <b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b>Various technologies are being developed to overcome the
      drawback of plastics, namely, their non-biodegradability. Though
      work has been done to make futuristic biodegradable plastics,
      there have not been many conclusive steps towards cleaning up the
      existing problem. Recycling waste plastics into reusable plastic
      products is a conventional strategy followed to address this issue
      for years. However this technique has not given impressive results
      as cleaning and segregation of waste plastics was found difficult.
      Over a 100 million tones of plastics are produced annually
      worldwide, and the used products have become a common feature at
      overflowing bins. Plastics is placed in a landfill, it becomes a
      carbon sink, Incineration, blast furnace, gasification are not
      much appreciated solution to the problem, as toxic gases are
      produced and their cost of production is quite high. Pyrolysis of
      waste plastics into fuel is one of the best means of conserving
      valuable petroleum resources in addition to protect the
      environment. This process involves catalytic degradation of waste
      plastic into fuel range hydrocarbon i.e. petrol, diesel and
      kerosene etc. A catalytic cracking process in which waste plastic
      were cracked at very high temperature, the resulting gases were
      condensed to recover liquid fuels. Type of plastics also effect
      the rate of conversion of into fuel and the results of this
      process are found to be better than other alternate methods which
      are used for the disposal of waste plastic.<br>

          weak magnetic fields in the Schumann Resonance band</b><br>
        <b>G. Elhalel, C. Price, D. Fixler &amp; A. Shainberg </b><br>
      </div>
      <b>Abstract</b><br>
      The Schumann Resonances (ScR) are Extremely Low Frequency (ELF)
      electromagnetic resonances in the Earth-ionosphere cavity excited
      by global lightning discharges. This natural electromagnetic noise
      has likely existed on the Earth ever since the Earth had an
      atmosphere and an ionosphere, hence surrounding us throughout our
      evolutionary history. The purpose of this study was to examine the
      influence of extremely weak magnetic fields in the ScR first mode
      frequency range on the spontaneous contractions, calcium
      transients and Creatine Kinase (CK) release of rat cardiac cell
      cultures. We show that applying 7.8?Hz, 90?nT magnetic fields (MF)
      causes a gradual decrease in the spontaneous calcium transients’
      amplitude, reaching 28% of the initial amplitude after 40?minutes
      of MF application, and accompanied with a gradual decrease in the
      calcium transients’ rise time. The mechanical spontaneous
      contractions cease after the ScR fields have been applied for more
      than 30?minutes, when the calcium transient’s amplitude reached
      ~60% of its initial value. The influence of the ScR MF was
      reversible, independent of the field magnitude in the range
      20?pT-100?nT, and independent of the external DC magnetic field.
      However, the effect is frequency dependent; the described changes
      occurred only in the 7.6–8?Hz range. In addition, applying 7.8?Hz,
      90?nT MF for 1.5?hours, reduced the amount of CK released to the
      buffer, during normal conditions, hypoxic conditions and oxidative
      stress induced by 80?µM H2O2. We show that the ScR field induced
      reduction in CK release is associated with a stress response
      process and has a protective character.<br>

      <div align="center"><b>A cell-killing strategy to slow aging
          passed its first test this year</b><br>
        <b>Are tired-out cells what make people old? A new generation of
          drugs is designed to wipe them out.</b><br>
        <b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by Karen Weintraub </b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      A red-hot anti-aging strategy quietly passed its first test
      earlier this year after 14 volunteers took drugs meant to kill off
      old, toxic cells in their bodies.<br>
      <br>
      The small study in people with lung disease, reported in January,
      is being billed as the first attempt at “senolytics,” or employing
      drugs to clear people’s bodies of aged, toxic cells. Some
      researchers think this strategy could eventually be employed in
      healthy people to delay aging.<br>
      <br>
      “This gives us to some extent a green light to go on to larger
      trials,” says James Kirkland, a Mayo Clinic professor who helped
      lead the trial, carried out in clinics in Texas and at Wake Forest
      University starting in 2016.<br>
      <br>
      Patients took two pills that Kirkland and his colleagues believed
      could selectively get rid of aged cells: the leukemia drug
      dasatinib and a supplement called quercetin.<br>
      <br>
      It is early days for drugs meant to slow aging, and some breathed
      a sigh of relief that patients in this first-of-a-kind study
      didn't suffer serious side-effects from the drugs. “My worry is we
      should not leap into this too fast, because if there’s a mistake
      or something we don’t understand, it could set the field back,”
      says Judith Campisi, a professor at the Buck Institute for
      Research on Aging in Novato, California. <br>
      <br>
      This was a pilot trial—not even in the first phase of a three-part
      sequence of trials needed to win approval by the US Food and Drug
      Administration. So, officially, it showed nothing about aging at
      all.<br>
      <br>
      All 14 patients suffered from a fatal, hard-to-treat lung
      condition called idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, which explains why
      they were willing to participate in the experiment. The doctors
      found that nine doses of the two pills over three weeks did seem
      to improve patients’ ability to walk a bit farther in the same
      amount of time, and several other measures of well-being.<br>
      <br>
      A bubble of commercial enthusiasm has been building around the
      idea that aging could be postponed, or its effects tempered, using
      drug treatments. A company called Unity Biotechnology of Brisbane,
      California, is developing two senolytic drugs, the first of which
      is in a phase 1 clinical trial for osteoarthritis—it’s being
      injected into people’s knees. Campisi is a cofounder of Unity, and
      Kirkland also holds shares in the public company, which is
      currently worth about half a billion dollars.<br>
      <br>
      These drugs take aim at senescent cells, which have exhausted
      their ability to divide but remain capable of spewing out a potent
      mix of chemical signals. “It is thought that these cells and the
      substances they produce are involved in the process of aging,”
      says Nicolas Musi, who participated in the new study and directs
      the Sam and Ann Barshop Institute for Longevity and Aging Studies
      at the University of Texas at Austin. “The idea is that removing
      these cells may be beneficial to promote healthy aging and also to
      prevent diseases of aging.”<br>
      <br>
      In idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, senescent cells build up in the
      lungs. In previous tests on mice, a combination of dasatinib and
      quercetin, which is a plant pigment, had been shown to eliminate
      such cells and extend the time the animals remained healthy
      (although it didn’t make them live longer).<br>
      <br>
      “It’s a glimmer into what may happen as we move these agents into
      humans,” Kirkland says. He cautions anti-aging enthusiasts from
      taking the pills on their own (quercetin is already available in
      online stores from supplement vendors with names like
      LifeExtension). “When we go from mice to people, that’s where we
      see things go wrong,” Kirkland says. “People should simply not be
      taking these drugs outside the context of a supervised clinical
      trial.”<br>
      <br>
      Not everything about senescent cells is bad. The cells, and their
      secretions, are believed to be important during the development of
      embryos, in the timing of labor, and in healing wounds and forming
      scar tissue. “You wouldn’t ever want to administer senolytics to a
      pregnant woman,” Campisi says. “It’s now becoming clear that you
      need these secretions for certain good things to happen. When the
      secretions become chronic as opposed to periodic or episodic,
      that’s when it starts to drive pathology.”<br>
      <br>
      Researchers are starting their tests in people with serious
      disease, but they eventually hope to explore whether senolytic
      agents could be given to healthy people, a bit like a semi-annual
      dental cleaning to remove plaque. “You reduce the burden of
      senescent cells, but it doesn’t have to go to zero,” Campisi
      imagines. “And then you get off the drugs.”<br>
      <br>
      Musi says he and Kirkland and their collaborators have begun a
      trial in 15 more lung patients, and the team at Mayo is testing
      the drug combination in 20 patients with chronic kidney disease.
      “If we see effectiveness signals and don’t encounter really bad
      side effects, we’ll try to get to people with less and less
      life-threatening conditions,” Kirkland says. “If everything goes
      right.”<br>

      </div>
      <br>
      This video demonstrates the unique Phi Geometry of Russian
      Pyramids.&nbsp; The procedure for determining this relationship
      involves stacking spheres on top each other, whose diameters
      decrease by Phi (1.6108). The pyramid that is constructed around
      these spheres has a slant angle of 76.345 degrees, which is within
      .245 degrees of the angle resulting from the ratio of height to
      base length of the Russian geometry.&nbsp; This difference is
      reconcilable when one goes from the theoretical world of geometry,
      which assumes objects have no height, width or depth, to the
      practical world of construction, where that is not the case.&nbsp;
      The Giza Pyramid is another example of a Sacred Geometry Pyramid
      whose actual dimensions are slightly different than the
      theoretical because of these same issues.<br>
