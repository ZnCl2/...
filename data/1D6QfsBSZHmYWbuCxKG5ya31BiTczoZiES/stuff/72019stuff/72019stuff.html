            Abstract<br>
          </b>There is substantial interest in growing crops in closed
          controlled environments, yet the energy requirements are high.
          Energy is required to produce light, but also to remove the
          heat generated when producing light. The goal of the current
          work examines a possible approach to decrease the energy
          requirement. The effect of pulsed light treatments was
          examined by monitoring seedling traits during early
          photomorphogenic development. Daily light integral remained
          unchanged between treatments, but the frequency of the pulses
          was varied. Developmental traits (such as inhibition of
          hypocotyl elongation rate) were most conspicuous during a
          normal photoperiod, as in twelve hours light, twelve hours
          darkness. Consistent with historical reports, when treatments
          were delivered in shorter durations (e.g. 1?h on/off)
          photomorphogenic development was hindered with the same daily
          light integral. However, at even shorter light intervals (e.g.
          seconds) seedlings developed as if they were provided full
          12?h treatments. Extension of the dark period following a 5?s
          pulse was tested to determine the effect on seedling traits.
          The results showed that the dark period could be extended to
          at least 10?s without affecting seedling development, and
          extension to 20?s only had slight effects on seedling traits.
          The mechanism of the phenomenon was examined in
          Arabidopsisthaliana photosensory mutants, and showed
          substantial contributions from the phyA and cry1 pathways. The
          results suggest that pulsed light with extended dark periods
          can decrease energy input by at least 30% to &gt;50% without
          affecting visible seedling traits. These pilot experiments in
          seedlings demonstrate that implementation of short-interval,
          pulsed-light strategies may lower energy requirements for
          growing crops in artificially illuminated environments.<br>

          </div>
          <b><br>
          </b>Researchers of the Jožef Stefan Institute, led by prof.
          dr. Dragan Mihailovic discovered an entirely new type of
          substance that can not be understood by current physics.
          During experiments aimed at the creation of new forms of
          quantum materials in tough disruptive conditions in the
          tantalum disulfide crystal, they generated an unusually dense
          amorphous electronic substance with short laser beams, in
          which, due to interaction, electrons become jammed. The
          discovery is fundamentally important as it opens up a new
          field, and its understanding is a new major challenge for
          today's quantum physics. The research was carried out entirely
          on a special low-temperature microscope with four peaks at the
          Jožef Stefan Institute, which is unique in the world. On July
          15, 2019, the prestigious science magazine Nature Materials
          reported the discovery.<br>

          <b>Abstract<br>
          </b>Distinct many-body states may be created under
          non-equilibrium conditions through different ordering paths,
          even when their constituents are subjected to the same
          fundamental interactions. The phase-transition mechanism to
          such states remains poorly understood. Here, we show that
          controlled optical or electromagnetic perturbations can lead
          to an amorphous metastable state of strongly correlated
          electrons in a quasi-two-dimensional dichalcogenide. Scanning
          tunnelling microscopy reveals a hyperuniform pattern of
          localized charges, whereas multitip surface nanoscale
          conductivity measurements and tunnelling spectroscopy show an
          electronically gapless conducting state that is different from
          conventional Coulomb glasses and many-body localized systems.
          The state is stable up to room temperature and shows no signs
          of either local charge order or phase separation. The
          mechanism for its formation is attributed to a dynamical
          localization of electrons through mutual interactions.
          Theoretical calculations confirm the correlations between
          localized charges to be crucial for the state’s unusual
          stability.<b><br>

          <b>Abstract<br>
          </b>We present the preliminary data in an ongoing open-label
          safety and tolerability proof of concept study exploring the
          potential role for 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine
          (MDMA)-assisted psychotherapy in treating patients with
          alcohol use disorder. At this stage, seven participants have
          completed the full 8-week MDMA-assisted psychotherapy course,
          including two therapy sessions each with MDMA. This paper
          focuses on the safety and tolerability of the therapeutic
          course for the first four participants to complete treatment.
          Longer-term outcomes of drinking behaviour will be presented
          later when the full project data are published. Results show
          all four participants have successfully tolerated the
          treatment. There have been no serious adverse events related
          to MDMA, no unexpected physiological responses to the MDMA
          sessions or changes to blood results or electrocardiograms,
          measured before and after the 8-week course. We conclude that
          the treatment is well- tolerated and are making plans to
          expand the project into a randomised placebo-controlled study.<br>

          the planet, organic foods are a great option. Organic foods
          aren’t treated with chemical pesticides and fertilizers and
          often have higher nutrition levels. Not sure if a piece of
          produce is organic?<br>
          <br>
          If you look at the PLU code once again, you’ll see the four
          digits identifying the item plus the number 9 at the

          We present the preliminary data in an ongoing open-label
          safety and tolerability proof of concept study exploring the
          potential role for 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine
          (MDMA)-assisted psychotherapy in treating patients with
          alcohol use disorder. At this stage, seven participants have
          completed the full 8-week MDMA-assisted psychotherapy course,
          including two therapy sessions each with MDMA. This paper
          focuses on the safety and tolerability of the therapeutic
          course for the first four participants to complete treatment.
          Longer-term outcomes of drinking behaviour will be presented
          later when the full project data are published. Results show
          all four participants have successfully tolerated the
          treatment. There have been no serious adverse events related
          to MDMA, no unexpected physiological responses to the MDMA
          sessions or changes to blood results or electrocardiograms,
          measured before and after the 8-week course. We conclude that
          the treatment is well- tolerated and are making plans to
          expand the project into a randomised placebo-controlled study.<br>

          </b>The mechanism which caused the crust that had been altered
          by seawater to sink into the mantle functioned over 3.3
          billion years ago. This means that a global cycle of matter,
          which underpins modern plate tectonics, was established within
          the first billion of the Earth’s existence, and the excess
          water in the transition zone of the mantle came from the
          ancient ocean on the planet’s surface,” said project leader
          and co-author of the article Alexander Sobolev, a member of
          the Russian Academy of Sciences (RAS) and Doctor of Geological
          and Mineralogical Sciences who is a Professor at Vernadsky
          Institute for Geochemistry and Analytical Chemistry under the
          Russian Academy of Sciences....<br>
          <br>
          The water that remains in minerals of the oceanic crust at
          higher temperatures continues to descend into the deep mantle
          and accumulates at a depth of 410-660 km in the structure of
          the minerals wadsleyite and ringwoodite and high-pressure
          modifications of olivine (magnesium iron silicate), the main
          mineral of the mantle. Experiments have shown that these
          minerals can contain significant quantities of water and
          chlorine. This is how the greatest part of the World Ocean
          could be “pumped” into the planet’s interior over the billions
          of years of its existence...<b><br>

          <b>Abstract<br>
          </b>Traditional covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are
          prepared via polymerization based on small molecular monomers.
          However, the employment of polymers as building blocks to
          construct COFs has not been reported yet. Herein, we create a
          new concept of polymer covalent organic frameworks (polyCOFs)
          formed by linear polymers as structural building blocks, which
          inherit the merits from both COFs and linear polymers.
          PolyCOFs represent a new category of porous COF materials that
          demonstrate good crystallinity and high stability. More
          importantly, benefiting from the flexibility and
          processability of a linear polymer, polyCOFs can spontaneously
          form defect-free, flexible, and freestanding membranes that
          exhibit excellent mechanical properties and undergo reversible
          mechanical transformation upon exposure to various organic
          vapors. For the first time, we demonstrated that polyCOF
          membranes can be used as artificial muscles to perform various
          complicated motions (e.g., lifting objects, doing “sit-ups”)
          triggered by vapors. This study bridges the gap between
          one-dimensional amorphous linear polymers and crystalline
          polymer frameworks and paves a new avenue to prepare
          stimuli-responsive actuators using porous COF materials.<br>

          <i>Europe responded once to the love of God.</i><i> Now it
            must suffer migrants, as His rod!</i><i><br>
          </i><br>
          In a recently appeared book or interview by a Roman Cardinal [
          Robert Sarah ] one can read unusual good sense on the waves of
          immigration that have now for tens of years been threatening
          to swamp the once great Western nations. But Cardinal Sarah is
          no “racist” – he comes from black Africa. If only Europeans
          would appreciate God’s gifts to Europe as he does! But who in
          Europe wants God? “Ay, there’s the rub,” as Hamlet says.<br>
          <br>
          I am scandalised by all these men dying at sea, by the human
          trafficking, by the mafia networking, by the organised
          slavery. These people emigrating with no papers, nor prospects
          for the future, nor family. Do they think they are going to
          find paradise on earth here? It’s not in the West! If these
          people are to be helped, better do it where they come from, in
          their own villages, amidst their own races. The economic
          imbalances and the human dramas cannot be justified. You
          cannot welcome migrants from all over the world. To welcome
          means not only letting these people into your own country, it
          means giving them work. Can you do that? No. It means giving
          them somewhere to live. Can you do that? No. Parking them in
          inadequate lodgings, with no dignity, no work, that is not
          what I call welcoming people. It is more like something
          organised by the mafia! The Church cannot co-operate in human
          trafficking, which is more like a new form of slavery.<br>
          <br>
          What I find equally scandalous is using the Word of God to
          justify all that. God does not want people migrating. The
          Christ child took refuge in Egypt, because of Herod, but he
          returned home afterwards. God always brought His people back
          to Israel, whether it was a famine at home, or a captivity
          abroad. A country is a great treasure, it is where we were
          born, where our ancestors are buried. When you welcome
          somebody, it is to give them a better life, not to herd them
          into immigration camps. When you are fed without doing any
          work, there is no dignity there.<br>
          <br>
          And what culture do you have to offer them? Are you capable of
          sharing your Christian culture and roots? I am afraid that the
          population imbalance brought about by these waves of
          immigration will make you lose your identity together with
          what makes you who you are. Europe has a special mission given
          to it by God. It is you Europeans that taught us the Gospel,
          and the values of family, personal dignity and freedom. If you
          give up your identity, if you allow yourselves to be swamped
          by peoples that do not share your culture, then your Christian
          values and identity risk disappearing. Like happened when
          ancient Rome was invaded by barbarians. You need to think –
          are today’s migrations not a new form of slavery, being
          organised to get cheap labour? All of these people coming here
          in pursuit of a dream way of life. What a lie! What sheer
          cynicism! Pope Benedict XVI was especially clear and prophetic
          on all these questions. [ . . . ]<br>
          <br>
          You Europeans have been moulded by Christianity, everything in
          Europe is Christian. Why deny it? No Muslim denies his
          identity. If you do not come back to being who you are, you
          will disappear. And if Europe disappears, there will be an
          appalling upset: Christianity would risk disappearing from the
          face of the earth. You see how you are being invaded by Islam:
          Muslims mean to take over the world, and they have the
          financial means to do it. They will not succeed because the
          Lord is with us to the end of the world. But you must not deny
          who you are: those immigrants that you allow in must integrate
          into your culture, assuming that you still have a culture. You
          will not integrate them into your atheistic materialism. They
          want nothing to do with it.<br>

            </b></b>When it is reported that Google is developing a
          censorable search engine aiming for re-entry in China , in the
          US · San Francisco, bypassing a huge service that functions as
          a gatekeeper on the Internet such as Google and Facebook, A
          conference " Decentralized Web Summit (DWeb Summit)" exploring
          "a new form of the World Wide Web" was held hosting the
          internet archive. 800 DI developers and groups participated in
          the DWeb Summit to share their ideas and Tim Bernards-Lee, who
          created the World Wide Web for the conference, also said that
          they participated.<br>
          <br>
          The cause of the DWeb concept being raised lies in the
          existence of a huge service that dominates the modern
          Internet. The former web started with a desktop PC connected
          and talking to each other, but from the time the word "Web
          2.0" came out, "the centralized service provided by large
          companies such as Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Amazon,
          Communication was carried out in a form via ".<br>
          <br>
          For example, the SNS service where individuals are connected
          to each other is connected on a platform called Facebook, so
          to speak, it is becoming "exchanges only inside the garden."
          In this "centralized" web world, users' information is
          aggregated and stored in the headquarters, so there is a
          danger of personal data being leaked due to cyber attacks due
          to hacking. Also, if the centralized service goes down there
          is a risk of losing communication means and saved data. In
          addition, the dangers of censorship by the government and
          others are obsessed, and it is inevitable to "privately sold
          out" that personal information gathered is used as a target
          advertisement.<br>
          <br>
          In order to solve the evils of the Web 2.0 generation like
          this, we created the distributed computing "DWeb" on the web.
          The difference between the conventional web and the DWeb is
          that communication based on peer-to-peer where terminals are
          connected to one another is fundamental. Second, computer
          terminals connected by peer-to-peer have a big difference "not
          only to request but to provide service". In other words, by
          utilizing the HTTP protocol, users will not be able to access
          information stored on a specific server, but will also serve
          as a medium for users to distribute distributed data.<br>
          <br>
          The basic technique which is the technical background of this
          DWeb idea is "block chain"...<br>

          </b>For almost 30 years they passed as quirky eccentrics,
          diligently setting up their insect traps in the Rhine
          countryside to collect tens of millions of bugs and creepy
          crawlers.<br>
          <br>
          Now the group of German entomology enthusiasts can boast a
          world-class scientific treasure: evidence of what is described
          as one of Earth's worst extinction phases since the dinosaurs
          vanished.<br>
          <br>
          Insects, which comprise two thirds of all terrestrial species,
          have been dying off at alarming rates, with disastrous impacts
          on food chains and habitats, researchers say.<br>
          <br>
          The home of the Amateur Entomology Society of Krefeld on the
          Dutch border is a former school building where thick curtains
          block out the sunlight....<br>
          <br>
          "Since 1982, the traps we manufacture ourselves have been
          standardised and controlled, all of the same size and the same
          material, and they are collected at the same rate in 63
          locations that are still identical," explains Sorg.<br>
          <br>
          The result is a treasure trove of quantitative data that
          dwarfs that of any funded university project, he says.<br>
          <br>
          But if he is visibly proud of the society's research, the
          outcome terrifies him: in the test period, the total biomass
          of flying insects here has plummeted by 76 percent....<br>
          <br>
          In February, they published the first synthesis of 73 studies
          on entomological fauna around the world over the past 40
          years, listing places from Costa Rica to southern France.<br>
          <br>
          They calculated that over 40 percent of insect species are
          threatened with extinction, and each year about one percent is
          added to the list.<br>
          <br>
          This is equivalent, they noted, to "the most massive
          extinction episode" since the dinosaurs disappeared.<br>
          <br>
          The main drivers appeared to be habitat loss and land
          conversion to intensive agriculture and urbanisation, followed
          by pollution, mainly from pesticides and fertilisers, invasive
          species and climate change.<br>
          <br>
          "The conclusion is clear," they wrote. "Unless we change our
          ways of producing food, insects as a whole will go down the
          path of extinction in a few decades." <br>

              Muslim World ‘Centuries Behind’ the West Due to Islam</b><br>
          </div>
          <b><br>
          </b>In January, then-Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson rejected
          accusations that he had sparked anti-Muslim rhetoric by
          comparing women wearing burkas to "letterboxes" and "bank
          robbers" in a column for the newspaper The Daily Telegraph.<br>
          <br>
          UK prime ministerial hopeful Boris Johnson has been slammed by
          a number of Muslim organisations for claiming that the Muslim
          world was allegedly “literally centuries behind” the West due
          to Islam.<br>
          <br>
          In an essay written by Johnson in 2006 and now unearthed by
          The Guardian, Johnson also specifically argued that “there
          must be something about Islam that indeed helps to explain why
          there was no rise of the bourgeoisie, no liberal capitalism
          and therefore no spread of democracy in the Muslim world”.<br>
          <br>
          According to him, the further the Muslim world had “fallen
          behind, the more bitterness and confusion there has been, to
          the point where virtually every global flashpoint you can
          think of – from Bosnia to Palestine to Iraq to Kashmir –
          involves some sense of Muslim grievance”.<br>
          <br>
          When praising The Sistine Chapel, Johnson claimed that there
          is nothing like this in Muslim art of “that or any age”. He
          insisted that this is not “just because it is beyond the
          technical accomplishment of Islamic art, but because it is so
          theologically offensive to Islam”...<br>

          Earthquakes may be triggered by sound waves that reduce the
          friction between rocks at a geological fault. That is the
          conclusion of an international team of researchers that has
          done laboratory-based experiments that mimic the process. The
          results support the “acoustic fluidization” theory of
          earthquake triggering, which seeks to explain the unexpected
          weakness of some faults. The research could also help to
          reveal how aftershocks are generated at great distances from
          the earthquakes that precede them...<br>

          </div>
          The unexpected weakness of some faults has been attributed to
          the emergence of acoustic waves that promote failure by
          reducing the confining pressure through a mechanism known as
          acoustic fluidization, also proposed to explain earthquake
          remote triggering. Here we validate this mechanism via the
          numerical investigation of a granular fault model system. We
          find that the stick-slip dynamics is affected only by
          perturbations applied at a characteristic frequency
          corresponding to oscillations normal to the fault, leading to
          gradual dynamical weakening as failure is approaching.
          Acoustic waves at the same frequency spontaneously emerge at
          the onset of failure in the absence of perturbations,
          supporting the relevance of acoustic fluidization in
          earthquake triggering.<br>

          <b><br>
          </b>Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a cancer associated with
          underlying liver disease and cirrhosis that often only becomes
          symptomatic when it is very advanced, is the second leading
          cause of cancer deaths around the world, and yet it has no
          effective treatment.<br>
          <br>
          As with other conditions without treatments, the data that
          scientists need to understand and treat the disease may be
          sitting in plain view in databases that have barely been
          analyzed, says Atul Butte, MD, PhD, director of the Institute
          for Computational Health Sciences at UC San Francisco.<br>
          <b><br>
          </b>Bin Chen, PhD, a former postdoctoral scholar in Butte’s
          lab and now a faculty member in Pediatrics in the Institute
          for Computational Health Sciences, recently published a paper
          in Gastroenterology about using data-mining computational
          tools to identify a treatment for HCC.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Gene Expression and Drug Targets</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          Taking advantage of publicly available gene expression data,
          he first derived a molecular disease signature for HCC –
          looking at 274 genes that are either up or down regulated in
          cancerous liver tissues, but not in normal liver tissues.<br>
          <br>
          Then, he looked for drugs that were known to target those
          genes and found, to his surprise, that a close cousin of a
          deworming pill, when used in combination with the standard
          care drug, was highly effective at killing cancerous liver
          tissue that had been engrafted into experimental mice.<br>
          Bin ChenBin Chen, PhD<br>
          <br>
          “We found these disease genes were reversed after six weeks of
          treatment in a patient-derived tissue in mouse model,” Chen
          said, adding that the advantage of the approach he developed
          is that it targets a host of genes at the same time, rather
          than simply targeting a single mutation.<br>
          <br>
          Chen said finding molecular signatures for diseases then
          looking for drugs that work against those signatures is a
          promising way of treating patients who may each have a
          different set of cancer mutations and might not respond to
          drugs that just targeted them one at a time.<br>
          <br>
          “In this study, patients had similar gene expression profiles,
          but not identical,” Chen said. “In most cases, cancers have
          many mutations, and patients will relapse. Our approach might
          be used to control the disease, to make it a chronic condition
          rather than a lethal one.”<br>
          Head Start to a New Drug Candidate<br>
          <br>
          Only a small number of drugs have been analyzed for their gene
          expression profiles, and so it was somewhat lucky that Chen
          found a hit with niclosamide. But even after discovering a
          match between the drug and the disease, his team of UCSF and
          Stanford University researchers was stymied. The drug, which
          was designed to kill parasites, did not work well in the mouse
          model, because it was not soluble.<br>
          <br>
          It was only after Chen’s team stumbled upon a paper that
          described its close cousin, NEN – an ethanolamine salt that is
          soluble in human cells – that they made it work. When they
          combined NEN with sorafenib, the standard of care for advanced
          HCC, they found that the tumors stopped growing.<br>
          <br>
          While NEN has been found safe to use against tapeworms in dogs
          and cats, scientists do not yet know how it would affect
          humans, or whether it would stop cancerous liver tissue from
          growing in humans.<br>
          <br>
          But Chen said it is a promising drug candidate that could be
          developed at half or less than half the cost of a typical drug
          because of the head start he got by using advanced
          computational techniques to mine freely available data.<br>
          <br>
          “Because our method is literally virtual, we can evaluate
          hundreds of drug candidates very quickly,” Chen said. “We
          looked at more than 1,000 drugs before discovering that the
          deworming pills were effective. This is a very efficient way
          to do drug discovery.”<br>

          <b>Abstract<br>
          </b>
          <div align="left">Sophoraflavanone G (SG) was isolated from
            Sophora flavescens. Previously, we have found that SG is
            able to suppress the inflammatory response in
            lipopolysaccharide-stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages. This
            study aimed to evaluate the effects of SG on apoptosis, and
            explore its molecular mechanism in human leukemia HL-60
            cells. HL-60 cells were treated with various concentrations
            of SG (3–30 µM). The viability of the HL-60 cells was
            assessed using the MTT method, and the nuclear condensation
            indicative of apoptosis was observed by DAPI fluorescence
            staining. In addition, apoptotic signal proteins were
            examined using Western blotting. The results showed that
            apoptosis, including DNA fragmentation and nuclear
            condensation, increased significantly in SG-treated HL-60
            cells. SG activated caspase-3 and caspase-9, and
            downregulated Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL. SG also upregulated Bax and
            released cytochrome c from the mitochondria into the
            cytoplasm, enabling apoptosis via the
            mitochondrially-mediated “intrinsic” pathway. Additionally,
            SG was able to cleave poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 and
            activate mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways.
            These results suggest that SG might increase the effect of
            apoptosis on HL-60 cells through caspase-3 activation,
            mitochondrial-mediated pathways, and the MAPK pathway.<br>

          <b>Abstract</b><br>
          The violation of a Bell inequality not only attests to the
          nonclassical nature of a system but also holds a very unique
          status within the quantum world. The amount by which the
          inequality is violated often provides a good benchmark on how
          a quantum protocol will perform. Acquiring images of such a
          fundamental quantum effect is a demonstration that images can
          capture and exploit the essence of the quantum world. Here, we
          report an experiment demonstrating the violation of a Bell
          inequality within observed images. It is based on acquiring
          full-field coincidence images of a phase object probed by
          photons from an entangled pair source. The image exhibits a
          violation of a Bell inequality with S = 2.44 ± 0.04. This
          result both opens the way to new quantum imaging schemes based
          on the violation of a Bell inequality and suggests promise for
          quantum information schemes based on spatial variables.<br>

          </b>...“There exist a class of the so-called Dirac materials,
          where the electrons behave as if they do not have a mass,
          similar to light particles, the photons,” explains Alexey
          Kuzmenko, a researcher at the Department of Quantum Matter
          Physics in UNIGE’s Science Faculty, who conducted this
          research together with Ievgeniia Nedoliuk. One of such Dirac
          materials is graphene, a monolayer of carbon atoms arranged in
          honeycomb structure, related to graphite used to make pencils.<br>
          <br>
          The interaction between graphene and light suggests that this
          material could be used to control infrared and terahertz
          waves. “That would be a huge step forward for optoelectronics,
          security, telecommunications and medical diagnostics,” points
          out the Geneva-based researcher.<br>

            Backing up an old theory via experimentation<br>
            <br>
          </b>A theoretical prediction from 2006 posited that if a Dirac
          material is placed in a magnetic field, it will produce a very
          strong cyclotron resonance. “When a charged particle is in the
          magnetic field, it moves in a circular orbit and absorbs the
          electromagnetic energy at the orbiting, or cyclotron,
          frequency, as for example, it happens in the Large Hadron
          Collider at CERN,” explains Alexey Kuzmenko. “And when the
          particles have charge but no mass, as electrons in graphene,
          the absorption of light is at its maximum!”<br>

            Abstract<br>
          </b>We show optical waves passing through a nanophotonic
          medium can perform artificial neural computing. Complex
          information is encoded in the wavefront of an input light. The
          medium transforms the wavefront to realize sophisticated
          computing tasks such as image recognition. At the output, the
          optical energy is concentrated in well-defined locations,
          which, for example, can be interpreted as the identity of the
          object in the image. These computing media can be as small as
          tens of wavelengths and offer ultra-high computing density.
          They exploit subwavelength scatterers to realize complex
          input/output mapping beyond the capabilities of traditional
          nanophotonic devices.<br>

              of artificial vision</b><br>
          </div>
          <b><br>
          </b>The sophisticated technology that powers face recognition
          in many modern smartphones someday could receive a high-tech
          upgrade that sounds — and looks — surprisingly low-tech. <br>
          <br>
          This window to the future is none other than a piece of glass.
          University of Wisconsin–Madison engineers have devised a
          method to create pieces of “smart” glass that can recognize
          images without requiring any sensors or circuits or power
          sources. <br>
          <br>
          “We’re using optics to condense the normal setup of cameras,
          sensors and deep neural networks into a single piece of thin
          glass,” says UW-Madison electrical and computer engineering
          professor Zongfu Yu. <br>
          <br>
          Light passing through “smart” glass is bent in a particular
          pattern depending on the scene, image or (in this case)
          written number facing the glass. If the light matches an
          expected pattern, the glass “recognizes” what it sees.<br>
          <br>
          Yu and colleagues published details of their proof-of-concept
          research today in the journal Photonics Research. <br>
          <br>
          Embedding artificial intelligence inside inert objects is a
          concept that, at first glance, seems like something out of
          science fiction. However, it’s an advance that could open new
          frontiers for low-power electronics. <br>
          <br>
          Now, artificial intelligence gobbles up substantial
          computational resources (and battery life) every time you
          glance at your phone to unlock it with face ID. In the future,
          one piece of glass could recognize your face without using any
          power at all. <br>
          <br>
          “This is completely different from the typical route to
          machine vision,” says Yu. <br>
          <br>
          He envisions pieces of glass that look like translucent
          squares. Tiny strategically placed bubbles and impurities
          embedded within the glass would bend light in specific ways to
          differentiate among different images. That’s the artificial
          intelligence in action. <br>
          <br>
          For their proof of concept, the engineers devised a method to
          make glass pieces that identified handwritten numbers. Light
          emanating from an image of a number enters at one end of the
          glass, and then focuses to one of nine specific spots on the
          other side, each corresponding to individual digits. <br>
          <br>
          The glass was dynamic enough to detect, in real-time, when a
          handwritten 3 was altered to become an 8. <br>
          <br>
          “The fact that we were able to get this complex behavior with
          such a simple structure was really something,” says Erfan
          Khoram, a graduate student in Yu’s lab. <br>
          <br>
          Designing the glass to recognize numbers was similar to a
          machine-learning training process, except that the engineers
          “trained” an analog material instead of digital codes.
          Specifically, the engineers placed air bubbles of different
          sizes and shapes as well as small pieces of light-absorbing
          materials like graphene at specific locations inside the
          glass. <br>
          <br>
          “We’re accustomed to digital computing, but this has broadened
          our view,” says Yu. “The wave dynamics of light propagation
          provide a new way to perform analog artificial neural
          computing” <br>
          <br>
          One such advantage is that the computation is completely
          passive and intrinsic to the material, meaning one piece of
          image-recognition glass could be used hundreds of thousands of
          times. <br>
          <br>
          “We could potentially use the glass as a biometric lock, tuned
          to recognize only one person’s face” says Yu. “Once built, it
          would last forever without needing power or internet, meaning
          it could keep something safe for you even after thousands of
          years.” <br>
          <br>
          Additionally, it works at literally the speed of light,
          because the glass distinguishes among different images by
          distorting light waves.<br>
          <br>
          Although the up-front training process could be time consuming
          and computationally demanding, the glass itself is easy and
          inexpensive to fabricate. <br>
          <br>
          In the future, the researchers plan to determine if their
          approach works for more complex tasks, such as facial
          recognition. <br>
          <br>
          “The true power of this technology lies in its ability to
          handle much more complex classification tasks instantly
          without any energy consumption,” says Ming Yuan, a
          collaborator on the research and professor of statistics at
          Columbia University. “These tasks are the key to create
          artificial intelligence: to teach driverless cars to recognize
          a traffic signal, to enable voice control in consumer devices,
          among numerous other examples.” <br>
          <br>
          Unlike human vision, which is mind-bogglingly general in its
          capabilities to discern an untold number of different objects,
          the smart glass could excel in specific applications — for
          example, one piece for number recognition, a different piece
          for identifying letters, another for faces, and so on. <br>
          <br>
          “We’re always thinking about how we provide vision for
          machines in the future, and imagining application specific,
          mission-driven technologies.” says Yu. “This changes almost
          everything about how we design machine vision.” <br>

              Report</b><br>
          </div>
          <b><br>
          </b>A 37-year-old man has shocked guests on one of Rimini’s
          beaches after he started pleasuring himself in public, all the
          while clenching a knife in his hand. When the police arrived,
          the man was reportedly surrounded by an infuriated crowd. He
          turned his rage against the police and reportedly threatened
          them: “I will kill you... I'm an Arab man!”<br>
          <br>
          Italian police have arrested 37-year-old Egyptian Ahmed
          Mohamed Walid Abdelshafi who scared beachgoers in one of
          Italy’s most famous resort towns, Rimini, the local outlets
          AdnKronos and Il Messaggero report. He was charged with public
          indecency as well as resisting law enforcement and serious
          threats to public officials.<br>
          <br>
          It was a Russian woman spending time on one of the beaches
          with her son and three other children, who informed a local
          bar owner about a scary stranger, who sat next to her family
          and started masturbating, all while panting and holding a
          knife in his fist. The lifeguard and beach staffers rushed to
          the scene close to a playground, where the man had been
          spotted. He was surrounded by angry parents, who reportedly
          argued and even pushed around the suspected offender before
          the police arrived. Law enforcement personnel are said to have
          saved him from being lynched, the local media suggest.<br>
          <br>
          After he was brought to the police station, Abdelshafi
          reportedly pushed and tugged one of the officers before he was
          tackled to the ground. It was discovered that he also had
          hematomas and scratches that are said to have been inflicted
          during the earlier altercation. The suspect was taken to a
          hospital, where he was diagnosed with a right rib fracture.<br>
          <br>
          While he was there, the man allegedly threatened the radiology
          technicians and shouted at them "I'll kill you”, mimicking the
          gesture of putting a knife to his throat.<br>
          <br>
          "I know a lot of people, I will send people who kill you and
          your families to your houses. When I go out I kill you with a
          knife, I'm an Arab man”, he cried, grabbing a metal pole and
          trying to hit people with it.<br>
          <br>
          He is also said to have threatened the policemen, promising to
          accuse them of inflicting bodily harm: "Tomorrow in court I
          will tell the judge that you broke my rib, so you will pay
          me”.<br>

                membranes for desalination</i><br>

            <br>
            Insect-inspired design principles lead to first-ever
            water-repellent membranes made from water-wet materials<br>
            <br>
            A new membrane made from water-wet materials has specially
            designed gas-entrapping pores that allow it to
            simultaneously separate hot, salty from cool, pure water
            while facilitating the transfer of pure vapor from one side
            to the other. This principle, designed by KAUST researchers,
            could lead to greener, cheaper desalination membranes.<br>
            <br>
            The membrane’s pores entrap air upon immersion in water,
            separating the liquids on either side and allowing the
            transport of only pure water vapour from the hot to the cold
            side<br>
            <br>
            Currently, super-water-repellent perfluorocarbon membranes
            are popularly used for a desalination process known as
            membrane distillation (MD). But perfluorocarbons are
            expensive, nonbiodegradable and vulnerable to fouling and
            damage at higher temperatures, explains KAUST postdoctoral
            fellow Ratul Das.<br>
            <br>
            With the aim of developing perfluorocarbon-free
            alternatives, Himanshu Mishra and his team of researchers at
            KAUST’s Water Desalination and Reuse Center drew inspiration
            from two insects: springtails that live in wet soils and
            seaskaters that live in open oceans. Both have
            mushroom-shaped microtextures covering their cuticles and
            hairs that can spontaneously entrap life-sustaining air if
            the insects become submerged in water. “We mimicked those
            features onto water-wet (nonwater resistant) materials. The
            resulting surfaces robustly entrap air upon immersion in
            liquids. The idea of gas-entrapping membranes was born,”
            says Mishra.<br>
            <br>
            Mishra’s team developed protocols for creating vertical
            pores within thin sheets. The diameters of the pore inlets
            and exits were abruptly smaller than the pore
            channels.&nbsp; “We began by toying with thin wafers of
            silicon to develop pores with these reentrant edges,” says
            Mishra. “These edges prevent liquids from intruding into the
            pores,” he explains. “We were able to achieve the function
            of perfluorinated membranes by harnessing this bio-inspired
            texture using water-wet materials, which might seem to defy
            conventional wisdom.” When a silicon membrane with simple
            cylindrical pores is immersed in water, it is completely
            filled within 1 second. Silica gas-entrapping membranes
            (GEMs), on the other hand, trap air robustly within their
            pores when immersed in water, and can remain intact for more
            than six weeks.<br>
            <br>
            The team then explored applying the same principle to a
            cheaper, easily manufactured water-wet material called
            poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), explains Sankara
            Arunachalam, a research specialist in Mishra’s team.
            “PMMA-GEMs robustly separated streams of hot, salty feed
            from cold water for more than 90 hours with a salt rejection
            of 100 percent,” he says.<br>
            <br>
            “To our knowledge, this is the first-ever demonstration of
            MD membranes derived from intrinsically wetting materials,”
            says Mishra. “The benefits are obvious: common water-wet
            plastics, such as PMMA, are significantly cheaper than
            perfluorinated ones, are environmentally friendly, and can
            withstand harsher operational conditions. Interdisciplinary
            investigations are needed to assess the scalability and
            reliability of this approach.”<br>
            <br>
            The findings could unlock the potential of common water-wet
            materials for greener, cheaper desalination.<br>

            <b>Abstract</b><br>
            Widespread stress on global water supplies compels the need
            for low-cost and sustainable desalination processes. In this
            regard, desalination through membrane distillation (MD) can
            harness waste-grade heat or renewable energy. So far, the
            membranes for MD have been exclusively derived from
            intrinsically water-repellant materials - mostly
            perfluorocarbons. However, perfluorocarbons are limiting in
            terms of operational conditions, and they also introduce
            economic and environmental concerns. The development of
            perfluorocarbon-free MD membranes would likely address those
            challenges. Here, we report on the proof-of-concept for
            biomimetic gas-entrapping membranes (GEMs) for MD derived
            from silica and poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) that are
            water-wet materials. We drew inspiration for our GEM design
            from the cuticles of springtails and hairs of Halobates
            germanus, both of which exhibit mushroom-shaped (or
            reentrant) features. Accordingly, our GEMs comprise arrays
            of microscale cylindrical pores with reentrant inlets and
            outlets that can robustly entrap air on submersion in water.
            Our PMMA-GEMs yielded a vapor flux of J1?L-m-2-h-1 while
            separating a solution of ~0.6?m NaCl at 333?K from deionized
            water at 288?K under a cross-flow configuration. To our
            knowledge, this is the first-ever demonstration of MD
            membranes derived from intrinsically water-wet materials,
            and these findings suggest that the rational design of
            membranes towards greener and cheaper desalination processes
            is possible.<br>

            </b><b>Solar-Powered Moisture Harvester Collects and Cleans
              Water from Air</b><b><br>
            </b><br>
            Access to clean water remains one of the biggest challenges
            facing humankind. A breakthrough by engineers at The
            University of Texas at Austin may offer a new solution
            through solar-powered technology that absorbs moisture from
            the air and returns it as clean, usable water.<br>
            <br>
            The breakthrough, described in a recent issue of the journal
            Advanced Materials, could be used in disaster situations,
            water crises or poverty-stricken areas and developing
            countries. The technology relies on hydrogels, gel-polymer
            hybrid materials designed to be “super sponges” that can
            retain large amounts of water.<br>
            <br>
            A research team led by Guihua Yu in UT Austin’s Cockrell
            School of Engineering combined hydrogels that are both
            highly water absorbent and can release water upon heating.
            This unique combination has been successfully proved to work
            in humid and dry weather conditions and is crucial to
            enabling the production of clean, safe drinking water from
            the air.<br>
            <br>
            With an estimated 50,000 cubic kilometers of water contained
            in the atmosphere, this new system could tap into those
            reserves and potentially lead to small, inexpensive and
            portable filtration systems.<br>
            <br>
            “We have developed a completely passive system where all you
            need to do is leave the hydrogel outside and it will collect
            water,” said Fei Zhao, a postdoctoral researcher on Yu’s
            team and co-author of the study. “The collected water will
            remain stored in the hydrogel until you expose it to
            sunlight. After about five minutes under natural sunlight,
            the water releases.”<br>
            <br>
            This technology builds upon a 2018 breakthrough made by Yu
            and Zhao in which they developed a solar-powered water
            purification innovation using hydrogels that cleans water
            from any source using only solar energy. The team’s new
            innovation takes that work a step further by using the water
            that already exists in the atmosphere. For both
            hydrogel-based technologies, Yu and his research team
            developed a way to combine materials that possess both
            hygroscopic (water-absorbing) qualities and
            thermal-responsive hydrophilicity (the ability to release
            water upon simple heating).<br>
            <br>
            “The new material is designed to both harvest moisture from
            the air and produce clean water under sunlight, avoiding
            intensive energy consumption,” said Yu, an associate
            professor of materials science and mechanical engineering.<br>
            <br>
            Harvesting water from moisture is not exactly a new concept.
            Most refrigerators keep things cool through a vapor
            condensation process. However, the common fridge requires
            lots of energy to perform that action. The UT team’s
            technology requires only solar power, is compact and can
            still produce enough water to meet the daily needs of an
            average household. Prototype tests showed daily water
            production of up to 50 liters per kilogram of hydrogel.<br>
            <br>
            Representing a novel strategy to improve upon atmospheric
            water harvesting techniques being used today, the technology
            could also replace core components in existing solar-powered
            water purification systems or other moisture-absorbing
            technologies.<br>
            <br>
            Yu and his team have filed a patent, and Yu is working with
            UT’s Office of Technology Commercialization on the licensing
            and commercialization of this innovative class of hydrogels.
            The research was funded by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation,

            <b>Abstract</b><b><br>
            </b>Atmospheric water harvesting (AWH)—producing fresh water
            via collecting moisture from air—enables sustainable water
            delivery without geographical and hydrologic limitations.
            However, the fundamental design principle to prepare
            materials that can convert the water vapor in the air to
            collectible liquid water is still mostly unknown. Here, a
            super moisture-absorbent gel, which is composed of
            hygroscopic polypyrrole chloride penetrating in
            hydrophilicity-switchable polymeric network of poly
            N-isopropylacrylamide, is shown. Based on such design, a
            high-efficiency water production by AWH has been achieved in
            a broad range of relative humidity. The synergistic effect
            enabled by the molecular level integration of hygroscopic
            and hydrophilicity-switchable polymers in a network
            architecture presents controllable interaction between the
            gel and water molecules, simultaneously realizing efficient
            vapor capturing, in situ water liquefaction, high-density
            water storage and fast water releasing under different
            weather conditions. Being an effective method to regulate
            migration of water molecules, such design represents a novel
            strategy to improve the AWH, and it is also fundamental to
            other water management systems for environmental cooling,
            surficial moisturizing and beyond.<br>

            <b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
            </b><br>
            The invention is directed to materials and methods for
            efficiently extracting potable water from atmospheric
            moisture.<br>
            <br>
            <b>BACKGROUND</b><b><br>
            </b><br>
            Providing potable water to the world's population remains
            one of the greatest challenges of our time. It is estimated
            that over one billion people in the world lack sufficient
            access to water, and close to 2.7 billion people find access
            to water scarce. The problem is especially frustrating as
            water covers over 70% of the earth's surface. However, of
            all the world's water, only 3% is fresh water; the remainder
            is non-potable salt water. Furthermore, two-thirds of fresh
            water supplies is inaccessible, as it is locked away in
            glaciers. There have been numerous attempts to convert ocean
            water to drinking water. Systems include reverse osmosis and
            solar desalinization. However, these solutions are only
            practical in coastal environments. Many of the world's
            water-starved regions are far inland, away from the oceans.
            Strategies other than desalinization have also been
            explored, for instance moisture extraction from the air.
            Conventional atmospheric moisture harvesting devices include
            condensing and cooling devices. However, these devices can
            be difficult and expensive to operate, and typically require
            electrical inputs to function. Such devices are not ideal
            for many of the most water-starved regions. Moreover, many
            moisture harvesters only function well in high humidity
            environments. Many regions lacking water security, however,
            are arid and dry throughout the year. More recently,
            researchers have explored hydrogels and various polymers to
            extract water from the air. However, while many materials
            that readily absorb moisture are known, substantially less
            common are those materials that will also readily release
            the absorbed water. Thermodynamically, a material that
            absorbs water under particular conditions will not release
            water under the same conditions without an additional energy
            input. Conductive hydrogels have been proposed that
            absorb/release moisture depending on the charge applied to
            the system. However, like conventional condensers, such
            systems require external electrical inputs.<br>
            <br>
            There remains a need for water harvesters capable of
            efficiently extracting moisture from the atmosphere, even in
            low humidity environments. There remains a need for water
            harvesters that do not include a complex array of engineered
            parts, and that are operable without electrical energy
            inputs.<br>

            The details of one or more embodiments are set forth in the

            <b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</b><b><br>
            </b>&nbsp;<br>
            The moisture harvesting networks include interpenetrating
            networks of hygroscopic polymers and thermoresponsive water
            storage polymers. Interpenetrating networks include those
            formed by forming one of the polymers (by polymerization) in
            the presence of the already -formed other polymer. The
            hygroscopic system absorbs moisture from the air, which is
            stored and selectively released by the thermoresponsive
            water storage system. As used herein, a moisture harvesting
            network can be designated a "super moisture absorbent gels,"
            or "SMAG." The storage modulus (G') and loss modulus (G")
            values can be used to determine if a network includes
            interpenetrating polymers. For instance, the
            interpenetrating networks disclosed herein will have lower
            G', lower G", or both lower G' and G" values than either the
            pure hygroscopic polymer, pure thermoresponsive water
            storage polymer, or simple mixtures of hygroscopic polymer
            and thermoresponsive water storage polymer. A simple mixture
            refers to the combination of two separately formed polymers.
            In certain embodiments, the storage modulus of the
            interpenetrating network will be less than the storage
            modulus of a simple mixture of the same polymers, in the
            same amounts. For instance, the storage modulus of the
            interpenetrating network can be 10% less, 25% less, 50%
            less, or 75% less than the storage modulus of the equivalent
            simple mixture of the same polymers. In certain embodiments,
            the loss modulus of the interpenetrating network will be
            less than the loss modulus of a simple mixture of the same
            polymers, in the same amounts. For instance, the loss
            modulus of the interpenetrating network can be 10% less, 25%
            less, 50% less, or 75% less than the loss modulus of the
            equivalent simple mixture of the same polymers.<br>
            <br>
            Hygroscopic polymer systems include those capable of
            extracting water from the atmosphere. Hygroscopic polymers
            include those that can absorb at least 50%, at least 100%,
            at least 150%, at least 200%, at least 250%, at least 300%,
            at least 350%, at least 400%, at least 450%, at least 500%,
            at least 550%, at least 600%, at least 650%, at least 700%,
            at least 750%, at least 800%, at least 850%, at least 900%,
            at least 950%, or at least 1000% by weight of water,
            relative to the dry weight of the polymer. Hygroscopic
            polymers include those having a mass average molar mass of
            less than 500,000, less than 450,000, less than 400,000,
            less than 350,000, less than 300,000, less than 250,000,
            less than 200,000, less than 175,000, less than 150,000,
            less than 125,000, less than 100,000, less than 75,000, or
            less than 50,000. Exemplary hygroscopic polymers include
            polyesters, polycarbonates, poly(meth)acrylates,
            polyacrylonitriles (e.g., ABS resins), poly(meth)acylamides,
            polysaccharides, polyheterocycles, and polysiloxanes...<br>
            &nbsp;<br>
            Thermoresponsive polymers include those which selectively
            retain or release water based on temperature. Such systems
            exhibit a volume phase transition at a certain temperature,
            resulting in a sudden change of the solvation state.
            Polymers that become less soluble (or insoluble) in water as
            temperature increases are characterized by a Lower Critical
            Solution Temperature (LCST). Thermoresponsive polymers that
            can be used in water harvesting systems can have an LCST
            from about 10-80° C, 20-70° C, 25-70° C, 30-70° C, 30-65° C,
            or 30-60° C.<br>
            <br>
            In some instances, the thermoresponsive water storage
            polymer can include one or more poly(N-alkylacrylamides),
            poly(N,N dialkylacrylamides), poly(acrylic acids),
            poly(vinyl ethers), or poly(vinylcaprolactams).
            Thermoresponsive water storage polymers can be derived from
            one or more monomers including N-alkylacrylamides, N,N-
            dialkylacrylamides, vinyl ethers, acrylic acid, and
            vinylcaprolactam. The thermoresponsive water storage polymer
            can further include monomers such as acrylic acid and/or
            acrylamide. The N-alkylacrylamide can be an
            N-Ci-C4alkylacrylamide, the N,N-dialkylacrylamide can be an
            N,N-di(Ci-C4)alkylacrylamide. The alkyl groups in in the
            N,N-dialkylacrylamides can be the same, or can be different.
            When the thermoresponsive polymer is a copolymer, it can be
            a random copolymer or block copolymer. Exemplary
            thermoresponsive storage polymers can be derived from
            N-alkylacrylamide and/or N,N-dialkylacrylamide monomers, and
            may further be derived from acrylic acid, including salts
            thereof, and/or acrylamide. The thermoresponsive storage
            polymer can be derived from one or more monomers such as
            methylacrylamide, ethylacrylamide, n-propylacrylamide,
            iso-propylacrylamide, n- butylacrylamide,
            iso-butylacrylamide, sec-butylacrylamide,
            tert-butylacrylamide, dimethylacrylamide, diethylacrylamide,
            di-n-propylacrylamide, di-iso-propylacrylamide, N-
            methyl-N-ethylacrylamide, N-methyl-N-n-propylacrylamide,
            N-ethyl-N-n-propylacrylamide,
            N-methyl-N-iso-propylacrylamide, and
            N-ethyl-N-iso-propylacrylamide. In some instance, the
            thermoresponsive polymer is derived from monomers including
            N-isopropylacrylamide or N,N-diethylacrylamide, and can
            further include monomers of acrylamide and/or acrylic acid.
            In certain embodiments, the thermoresponsive polymer can
            include block copolymers of polyethylene oxide and
            polypropylene oxide...<br>
            <br>
            Because the water harvesting networks disclosed herein
            include thermoresponsive water storage polymers, they can be
            utilized without the use of electricity or other artificial
            energy outputs. For instance, the water harvested can be
            placed in a cool environment, for instance in the shade or
            overnight, to absorb water. The hydrated harvester can be
            placed in a collector and exposed to sunlight. As the sun
            heats the network, the thermoresponsive polymer undergoes a
            phase transition, releasing water into the collector. For
            instance, the network can be heated to a temperature of at
            least 30° C, at least 35° C, or at least 40° C, at which
            time the absorbed water will be rapidly released from the
            network. Generally, at least 50% of the water will be
            released in less than 60 minutes, less than 45 minutes, less
            than 30 minutes, less than 20 minutes, or less than 10
            minutes when the network is heated to a temperature greater
            than the Lower Critical Solution Temperature (LCST) of
            thethermoresponsive water storage polymer. <br>

            The following examples are set forth below to illustrate the

            matter. These examples are not intended to be inclusive of
            all aspects of the subject matter disclosed herein, but
            rather to illustrate representative methods, compositions,

            equivalents and variations of the present invention, which
            are apparent to one skilled in the art.<br>
            <br>
            Efforts have been made to ensure accuracy with respect to
            numbers (e.g., amounts, temperature, etc.) but some errors
            and deviations should be accounted for. Unless indicated
            otherwise, parts are parts by weight, temperature is in °C
            or is at ambient temperature, and pressure is at or near
            atmospheric. There are numerous variations and combinations
            of reaction conditions, e.g., component concentrations,
            temperatures, pressures, and other reaction ranges and
            conditions that can be used to optimize the product purity
            and yield obtained from the described process. Only
            reasonable and routine experimentation will be required to
            optimize such process conditions.<br>
            <br>
            Example 1: Interpenetrating network formed by polymerizing a
            thermoresponsive polymer in the presence of a hygroscopic
            polymer<br>
            <br>
            Pyrrole monomer, ammonium persulfate ("APS") and LiCl (molar
            ratio 1 : 1 : 1) was gradually added into an aqueous HC1
            solution (3.7 % wt). The polymerization reaction was stopped
            by vacuum filtering and washing. The obtained black product
            was dispersed in DI water by sonication. The resulting PPyCl
            polymer (50 µg), N-isopropylacrylamide<br>
            <br>
            ("NIP AM") monomers (567 mg), N, N-tetramethylenediamine (10
            µ?) and deionized water (10 mL) were mixed together and
            purged with nitrogen for ten minutes, followed by
            centrifugation for five min with a speed of 7000 rpm. Then
            ?',?'-methylenebisacrylamide (0.3 mg) and APS (0.56 mg) were
            added into the solution. The polymerization was carried out
            for 12 h. The obtained hydrogel was immersed into DI water
            overnight to remove unreacted monomers. As shown in Figure
            8, the resulting material showed good water
            absorbing/releasing properties over multiple cycles. Figure
            9 depicts an FT-IR spectrum of NIP AM alone, PPyCl alone and
            the interpenetrating network.<br>
            <br>
            Example 2: Interpenetrating network formed by polymerizing a
            hygroscopic polymer in the presence of a thermoresponsive
            polymer<br>
            <br>
            N-isopropylacrylamide monomers (567 mg), N,
            N-tetramethylenediamine (10 µ?) acting as accelerator and
            deionized (DI) water (10 mL) were mixed together and purged
            with nitrogen for 10 min (Solution E). The bubbles in the
            solution E was removed by centrifugation for 5 min at a
            speed of 7000 rpm. Then the N', N'-methylenebisacrylamide
            and solution (100 µ?, 30 mg/mL) acting as the cross linker
            and ammonium persulfate solution (APS, 50 228 mg/mL) acting
            as the initiator were added into 1 mL solution E under
            sonication. The polymerization was carried out for 12 h. The
            obtained poly-NIPAM hydrogel was immersed into hot DI water
            (ca. 80 °C) for 12 h to remove unreacted monomers.<br>
            <br>
            Poly-NIPAM hydrogel (ca. 1 cm&lt;3&gt;) was immersed in hot
            DI water (80 °C) to be completely shrunk and then
            transferred into pyrrole solution (volume ratio of pyrrole
            and water is 1 : 10) overnight. The swollen hydrogel was
            washed with DI water. Then, the poly -NIP AM/Py hydrogel was
            immersed into a solution of ammonium persulfate (228 mg),
            lithium chloride (127 mg), 37% hydrochloride (85 uL) and 10
            mL DI water. The hybrid gel was formed overnight by in situ
            polymerization within the poly-NIPAM hydrogel. Finally, the
            obtained poly-NIPAM/PPy-Cl was immersed into hot DI water
            (ca. 80 °C) for 3 h to remove unreacted monomers. The
            purification step was repeated 3 times.<br>
            <br>
            The G' and G" values of pure poly-NIPAM gel, poly -NIP
            AM/PPy-Cl gel and SMAG are shown in fig. S2. Their gel
            states are revealed by the wide linear viscoelastic region
            in the dynamic frequency sweep experiments and further
            confirmed by the fact that the value of storage modulus is
            higher than that of the loss modulus in each case. The
            poly-NIP AM/PPy- Cl gel sample shows identical G' and G"
            values with those of pure poly-NIPAM gel, which is
            attributed to the similar skeleton structure brought by the
            continuous and flexible polymeric network of the poly-NIPAM.
            On the contrary, the G' and G" values of SMAG are
            significantly lower than that of the poly -NIP AM/PPy-Cl
            gel, indicating a weakened skeleton. Moreover, the G" of
            SMAG and all the control samples based on poly-NIPAM show
            identical trend (e.g. inflection point at -50 Hz),
            indicating that the framework of SMAG was established by the
            poly-NIPAM network.<br>

            Example 3: Water harvesting evaluation<br>
            <br>
            The RH can be stabilized to a required value by a certain
            super-saturated salt solution. To evaluate the
            hygroscopicity, the obtained samples were attached in the
            nylon mesh bag, which was suspended above the
            super-saturated salt solution in an enclosed container
            (without air convection) at a temperature of 25 °C (achieved
            by constant temperature oven) to create required RH level.
            Additionally, since the RH is related to the air pressure, a
            needle was used to connect internal space and atmosphere,
            maintaining an ambient air pressure. A series of RH can be
            achieved by specially selected salts.<br>

            <br>
            <br>
            The network prepared in Example 2 was cut into sheets with
            thickness of ~5 mm were cut into small pieces with area of 1
            cm&lt;2&gt;. The obtained tablets were completely dried in
            vacuum oven at 100 °C. The dried network (50 g) was bagged
            by meshed nylon and exposed to moisture air at certain
            relative humidity (RH). After that the hydrated tablets were
            heated by the solar radiation (lkW m&lt;"2&gt;) to release
            the containing water in a closed transparent container. The
            volume of collected water was directly measured by a
            graduated cylinder. For a typical AWH cycle at RH of 60% and
            90 %, the time of water capturing and releasing were 50 min
            and 10 min, respectively. For a typical AWH cycle at RH of
            30 %, the time of water capturing and releasing were 280 min
            and 80 min, respectively. Figure 11 depicts the water
            absorption isotherms of SMAG networks at different relative
            humidities.<br>
            <br>
            Example 4: Atmospheric water harvesting (AWG)<br>
            <br>
            Small SMAG tablets (Fig. 14 A) were packaged in transparent
            nylon mesh bags (Fig.14A I and II), which were exposed to
            air for water capturing and placed on the upper layer of a
            closed container for water releasing, demonstrating a
            scalable, potentially low-cost atmospheric water harvester.
            The solar vaporized water (i.e. normal mode) was condensed
            on the transparent condenser (Fig. 14A III) and flowed to
            the bottom, converging with the directly released water upon
            the express mode (Fig. 14A IV). As shown in Fig 14 B and C,
            upon exposure to the moist air, the original dry SMAG bags
            display a visible swelling after several hours, indicating
            that the moisture can be captured by the SMAGs. The
            subsequent water releasing of swollen SMAGs was processed by
            placing the container under natural sunlight.<br>
            <br>
            The AWH experiment was carried out from 5:00 a.m. (ca. 1
            hour before sunrise) to 9:00 a.m. under a sunshade, where
            the ambient temperature, RH and dew point temperature were
            traced (Fig. 14D). In the early -morning, the RH was around
            85 %, indicating an ideal environment for rapid water
            harvesting. However, the comparison of ambient temperature
            (Fig. 14D) and dew point temperature (Fig. 14D) eliminated
            the possibility of spontaneous water condensation. Upon
            exposure to the ambient, the water uptake of SMAG tablets
            can be increased to 5.4 g g&lt;"1&gt;in four hours with an
            average water capturing rate of ca. 1.3 g
            g&lt;"1&gt;h&lt;"1&gt;. Subsequently, the hydrated SMAGs
            were retrieved and exposed to the sunlight (ca. 0.7 kW
            m&lt;"2&gt;) from 10:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. (Fig. 14E). The
            water adsorbed at the surface of SMAG tablets can be
            evaporated by the solar heating, increasing the internal RH
            of the container (to a saturated state). When the SMAGs were
            heated to ca. 40 °C, its surface temperature variation was
            slowed down (Fig. 14E), indicating a stimulated water
            releasing in the express mode. The quantitative monitoring
            of water uptake (Fig. 14E) further confirmed a major water
            release of 3.9 g g&lt;"1&gt;from 10:40 to 11 :20. After
            that, the surface temperature of SMAG gradually increased to
            ca. 63 °C, which was an equilibrium temperature upon
            evaporation cooling and solar heating due to the water
            release in the normal mode. It still contributed to a
            continuous water release (ca. 0.4 g g&lt;"1&gt;h&lt;"1&gt;)
            after 11 :20. Moreover, the condenser maintained a low
            temperature (Fig. 14E), enabling a steady condensation of
            vaporized water. The internal air temperature went beyond 40
            °C after 12:00 a.m. (Fig. 14E), suggesting that the main
            water releasing process was finished. It was worth noting
            that, although the environmental RH is fluctuant and the
            natural sunlight is relatively weak compared with most of
            drought regions around the world, the SMAG presents
            efficient water production. These results indicate that the
            SMAGs enables a flexible AWH adapting to the varying
            environment, revealing its potential for practical
            applications.<br>

            </b><b>Abstract</b><b><br>
            </b>We report a self-consistent method to translate amino
            acid sequences into audible sound, use the representation in
            the musical space to train a neural network, and then apply
            it to generate protein designs using artificial intelligence
            (AI). The sonification method proposed here uses the normal
            mode vibrations of the amino acid building blocks of
            proteins to compute an audible representation of each of the
            20 natural amino acids, which is fully defined by the
            overlay of its respective natural vibrations. The
            vibrational frequencies are transposed to the audible
            spectrum following the musical concept of transpositional
            equivalence, playing or writing music in a way that makes it
            sound higher or lower in pitch while retaining the
            relationships between tones or chords played. This
            transposition method ensures that the relative values of the
            vibrational frequencies within each amino acid and among
            different amino acids are retained. The characteristic
            frequency spectrum and sound associated with each of the
            amino acids represents a type of musical scale that consists
            of 20 tones, the “amino acid scale”. To create a playable
            instrument, each tone associated with the amino acids is
            assigned to a specific key on a piano roll, which allows us
            to map the sequence of amino acids in proteins into a
            musical score. To reflect higher-order structural details of
            proteins, the volume and duration of the notes associated
            with each amino acid are defined by the secondary structure
            of proteins, computed using DSSP and thereby introducing
            musical rhythm. We then train a recurrent neural network
            based on a large set of musical scores generated by this
            sonification method and use AI to generate musical
            compositions, capturing the innate relationships between
            amino acid sequence and protein structure. We then translate
            the de novo musical data generated by AI into protein
            sequences, thereby obtaining de novo protein designs that
            feature specific design characteristics. We illustrate the
            approach in several examples that reflect the sonification
            of protein sequences, including multihour audible
            representations of natural proteins and protein-based
            musical compositions solely generated by AI. The approach
            proposed here may provide an avenue for understanding
            sequence patterns, variations, and mutations and offers an
            outreach mechanism to explain the significance of protein
            sequences. The method may also offer insight into protein
            folding and understanding the context of the amino acid
            sequence in defining the secondary and higher-order folded
            structure of proteins and could hence be used to detect the
            effects of mutations through sound.<br>

            <br>
            In a surprising marriage of science and art, researchers at
            MIT have developed a system for converting the molecular
            structures of proteins, the basic building blocks of all
            living beings, into audible sound that resembles musical
            passages. Then, reversing the process, they can introduce
            some variations into the music and convert it back into new
            proteins never before seen in nature.<br>
            <br>
            Although it's not quite as simple as humming a new protein
            into existence, the new system comes close. It provides a
            systematic way of translating a protein's sequence of amino
            acids into a musical sequence, using the physical properties
            of the molecules to determine the sounds. Although the
            sounds are transposed in order to bring them within the
            audible range for humans, the tones and their relationships
            are based on the actual vibrational frequencies of each
            amino acid molecule itself, computed using theories from
            quantum chemistry.<br>
            <br>
            The system was developed by Markus Buehler, the McAfee
            Professor of Engineering and head of the Department of Civil
            and Environmental Engineering at MIT, along with postdoc Chi
            Hua Yu and two others. As described in the journal ACS Nano,
            the system translates the 20 types of amino acids, the
            building blocks that join together in chains to form all
            proteins, into a 20-tone scale. Any protein's long sequence
            of amino acids then becomes a sequence of notes.<br>
            <br>
            While such a scale sounds unfamiliar to people accustomed to
            Western musical traditions, listeners can readily recognize
            the relationships and differences after familiarizing
            themselves with the sounds. Buehler says that after
            listening to the resulting melodies, he is now able to
            distinguish certain amino acid sequences that correspond to
            proteins with specific structural functions. "That's a beta
            sheet," he might say, or "that's an alpha helix."<br>
            <br>
            <b>Learning the language of proteins</b><b><br>
            </b><br>
            The whole concept, Buehler explains, is to get a better
            handle on understanding proteins and their vast array of
            variations. Proteins make up the structural material of
            skin, bone, and muscle, but are also enzymes, signaling
            chemicals, molecular switches, and a host of other
            functional materials that make up the machinery of all
            living things. But their structures, including the way they
            fold themselves into the shapes that often determine their
            functions, are exceedingly complicated. "They have their own
            language, and we don't know how it works," he says. "We
            don't know what makes a silk protein a silk protein or what
            patterns reflect the functions found in an enzyme. We don't
            know the code."<br>
            <br>
            By translating that language into a different form that
            humans are particularly well-attuned to, and that allows
            different aspects of the information to be encoded in
            different dimensions -- pitch, volume, and duration --
            Buehler and his team hope to glean new insights into the
            relationships and differences between different families of
            proteins and their variations, and use this as a way of
            exploring the many possible tweaks and modifications of
            their structure and function. As with music, the structure
            of proteins is hierarchical, with different levels of
            structure at different scales of length or time.<br>
            <br>
            The team then used an artificial intelligence system to
            study the catalog of melodies produced by a wide variety of
            different proteins. They had the AI system introduce slight
            changes in the musical sequence or create completely new
            sequences, and then translated the sounds back into proteins
            that correspond to the modified or newly designed versions.
            With this process they were able to create variations of
            existing proteins -- for example of one found in spider
            silk, one of nature's strongest materials -- thus making new
            proteins unlike any produced by evolution.<br>
            <br>
            Although the researchers themselves may not know the
            underlying rules, "the AI has learned the language of how
            proteins are designed," and it can encode it to create
            variations of existing versions, or completely new protein
            designs, Buehler says. Given that there are "trillions and
            trillions" of potential combinations, he says, when it comes
            to creating new proteins "you wouldn't be able to do it from
            scratch, but that's what the AI can do."<br>
            <br>
            <b>"Composing" new proteins</b><b><br>
            </b><br>
            By using such a system, he says training the AI system with
            a set of data for a particular class of proteins might take
            a few days, but it can then produce a design for a new
            variant within microseconds. "No other method comes close,"
            he says. "The shortcoming is the model doesn't tell us
            what's really going on inside. We just know it works."<br>
            <br>
            This way of encoding structure into music does reflect a
            deeper reality. "When you look at a molecule in a textbook,
            it's static," Buehler says. "But it's not static at all.
            It's moving and vibrating. Every bit of matter is a set of
            vibrations. And we can use this concept as a way of
            describing matter."<br>
            <br>
            The method does not yet allow for any kind of directed
            modifications -- any changes in properties such as
            mechanical strength, elasticity, or chemical reactivity will
            be essentially random. "You still need to do the
            experiment," he says. When a new protein variant is
            produced, "there's no way to predict what it will do."<br>
            <br>
            The team also created musical compositions developed from
            the sounds of amino acids, which define this new 20-tone
            musical scale. The art pieces they constructed consist
            entirely of the sounds generated from amino acids. "There
            are no synthetic or natural instruments used, showing how
            this new source of sounds can be utilized as a creative
            platform," Buehler says. Musical motifs derived from both
            naturally existing proteins and AI-generated proteins are
            used throughout the examples, and all the sounds, including
            some that resemble bass or snare drums, are also generated
            from the sounds of amino acids.<br>
            <br>
            The researchers have created a free Android smartphone app,
            called Amino Acid Synthesizer, to play the sounds of amino
            acids and record protein sequences as musical compositions.<br>

            By now, almost everyone has heard of the human microbiome -
            the collection of viruses, bacteria, and fungi that play a
            pivotal role in our health and cognitive functioning. Also
            called the microbiota, we’ve long assumed that the
            microbiome consists of microbes that reside along our
            gastrointestinal tract - and more recently, on our skin.
            That’s logical enough; microbes live on our interfaces with
            the outside world. Conversely, there are certain areas in
            the human body that are assumed to be sterile, aka free of
            microbes, like the eye and the womb. However, advances in
            analytical techniques enabled researchers to recently
            identify the placental microbiome1 and eye microbiome2 that
            are present in healthy people. That’s pretty cool, but there
            definitely couldn’t be microbes in our brains, the most
            protected area of our bodies, right?<br>
            <br>
            A head-turning poster3 at the November 2018 Society for
            Neuroscience scientific conference called into question the
            assumption of the brain as a sterile, bacteria-free zone. A
            team of researchers from The University of Alabama in
            Birmingham (UAB), led by Professor Rosalinda Roberts, showed
            high-resolution microscope images of mouse and human brains
            that depicted bacteria happily residing in astrocytes,

            <b>Abstract</b><b><br>
            </b>It is widely recognised that type 2 diabetes (T2D)
            represents a major disease burden but it is only recently
            that its role in neurodegeneration has attracted more
            attention. This research has shown that T2D is associated
            with impaired cerebral health, cognitive decline and
            dementia. However, the impact on the brain of progressive
            metabolic changes associated with the pre-clinical
            development of the disease is less clear. The aim of this
            review is to comprehensively summarise how the emergence of
            risk factors and co-morbid conditions linked to the
            development of T2D impact cerebral health. Particular
            attention is directed at characterising how normal but
            elevated blood glucose levels in individuals without T2D
            contribute to neurodegenerative processes, and how the main
            risk factors for T2D including obesity, physical activity
            and diet modulate these effects. Where available, evidence
            from the animal and human literature is contrasted, and sex

            In a veritable twist on Jesus turning water into wine, here
            we have a device that turns air into water. Now, not only is
            that sheer genius, it is also useful considering sustainable
            development.<br>
            <br>
            After creating a shipping container that would convert air
            into water, California designers David Hertz and Rich Groden
            were the obvious winners of the Water Abundance XPrize.
            Their device was successful in satisfying the water needs of
            100 people.<br>
            <br>
            This competition began in 2016 with a focus to create water
            out of nature, which would be increasingly cheap (2 cents a
            litre). About 100 teams had participated in this, all trying
            to draw out 2000 litres per day simply out of the moisture
            present. Groden and Hertz’s team Skywater/Sky source
            Alliance were the final winners as their project was the
            best example of decentralised access to water, which would
            prevent any monopoly over it.<br>
            <br>
            The creation called ‘WeDew’ is actually a combination of two
            devices that work in sync with each other to create water.
            This is also an abbreviation for the system they use – wood
            to energy deployed water system. The first machine is called
            the Skywater, which is a generator created by Groden and
            basically, it emulates the functions of clouds. It forms
            drops of water which are condensed in a tank and trapped for
            later use.<br>
            <br>
            The other device is a gasifier that helps in providing the
            energy required to start such a machine. It needs wood or
            coconut pieces to produce the amount of heat that would be
            required to produce an optimum environment for the device to
            operate efficiently.<br>
            <br>
            In an interview with Fast News, Hertz told that this was a
            company which used carbon negative technology. He further
            mentioned that this was what all companies would use in the
            future to repent for what they have done to this Earth over
            the millennia.<br>

            While they won the award, they weren’t the only ones with an
            innovative design. The runners up of the competition were
            Hawaii based JMCC WING, who received $150000 for their
            innovative wind energy system that extracted water from the
            atmosphere.<br>
            <br>
            According to UNICEF reports, around 2.1 billion people in
            the world face water shortage. And therefore all these
            designs are supremely important as they focus on water
            conservation. With respect to their innovation, both
            designers are planning to implement their designs all over
            the world. For this, they are collaborating with several
            NGOs around the world in order to help water-scarce
            countries.<br>

                Alzheimer's</b><br>
            </div>
            <br>
            Researchers in Norway have discovered a clear connection
            between oral health and Alzheimer's disease. <br>
            <br>
            ou don't only avoid holes in your teeth by keeping good oral
            hygiene, researchers at the University of Bergen have
            discovered a clear connection between gum disease and
            Alzheimer´s disease.<br>
            <br>
            The researchers have determined that gum disease
            (gingivitis) plays a decisive role in whether a person
            developes Alzheimer´s or not.<br>
            <br>
            "We discovered DNA-based proof that the bacteria causing
            gingivitis can move from the mouth to the brain," says
            researcher Piotr Mydel at Broegelmanns Research Laboratory,
            Department of Clinical Science, University of Bergen (UiB).<br>
            <br>
            The bacteria produces a protein that destroys nerve cells in
            the brain, which in turn leads to loss of memory and
            ultimately, Alzheimer´s.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Brush your teeth for better memory</b><b><br>
            </b><br>
            Mydel points out that the bacteria is not causing
            Alzheimer´s alone, but the presence of these bacteria raise
            the risk for developing the disease substantially and are
            also implicated in a more rapid progression of the disease.
            However, the good news is that this study shows that there
            are some things you can do yourself to slow down
            Alzheimer´s.<br>
            <br>
            "Brush your teeth and use floss." Mydel adds that it is
            important, if you have established gingivitis and have
            Alzheimer´s in your family, to go to your dentist regularly
            and clean your teeth properly.<br>
            <br>
            <b>New medicine being developed</b><b><br>
            </b><br>
            Researchers have previously discovered that the bacteria
            causing gingivitis can move from the mouth to the brain
            where theharmful enzymes they excrete can destroy the nerve
            cells in the brain. Now, for the first time, Mydel has
            DNA-evidence for this process from human brains. Mydel and
            his colleagues examined 53 persons with Alzheimer´s and
            discovered the enzyme in 96 per cent of the cases.According
            to Mydel, this knowledge gives researchers a possible new
            approach for attacking Alzheimer´s disease.<br>
            <br>
            "We have managed to develop a drug that blocks the harmful
            enzymes from the bacteria, postponing the development of
            Alzheimer´s. We are planning to test this drug later this
            year, says Piotr Mydel.<br>

                scientists convert all types to O using gut bacteria </b><br>
            </div>
            <br>
            &nbsp;In a breakthrough that could save thousands of lives,
            scientists have found a way to convert all blood types to
            the universal type that is safe for all patients to receive,
            by using microbes found in the human gut.<br>
            <br>
            Researchers from the University of British Columbia have
            figured out how to convert blood types A, B and AB into the
            universal Type O, which all patients can receive in a
            transfusion, regardless of their own blood type.<br>
            <br>
            Blood types are differentiated by the kinds of sugar found
            on the surface of red blood cells. Type O has no sugars.
            Scientists had realized that some enzymes can remove the
            sugars from A, B and AB blood cells, turning them into Type
            O, but they hadn’t found an enzyme that was safe, efficient
            and economical, until they considered the gut.<br>
            <br>
            The human digestive tract has the same sugars found on blood
            cells, and bacterial enzymes found in feces strip the sugars
            from the lining to aid digestion. The scientists were able
            to isolate the enzyme and use it to strip blood of its
            sugars in a more efficient way than any other enzyme.<br>
            <br>
            The scientists made the exciting discovery last August, but
            have just published the results of their research in the
            journal Nature Microbiology.<br>
            <br>
            The next step is for the team to test the enzyme conversion
            in a clinical setting to see if there are any side effects
            of the procedure. If none are found, the future of blood
            donation will change for the better.<br>
