        <b>Method for adjusting life decoding energy</b><br>
      </div>
      <b>Inventor(s): &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ZHAO XIANFENG +<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
      </b>The invention provides a method for adjusting life decoding
      energy, comprising the step of adopting a sealed device capable of
      allowing people to enter, wherein the device is provided with an
      accurate temperature control system, a germanium energy system, a
      quantity-controlled far infrared system, an anion generating
      component, a frequency spectrum system and a scalar energy
      manufacture system of a thermal system; and the device is used for
      balancing, polymerizing and amplifying the bio-energy by the
      systems and the components, and wholly and systematically
      adjusting the universal energy and the environment energy.
      According to the method, the biological cells can be activated and
      the energy absorption can be assisted according to the energy
      medicine, so that the communication between the body energy
      substance and the body energy system can be realized, and the
      activity of human cells can be quickly started. The method is
      simple and scientific to realize, and high in safety, so that the
      mortality of the cells can be effectively reduced, and the nursing
      requirement on the human health care and health can be met.<b>..<br>
      </b><br>
      One embodiment, the energy producing system comprises a scalar
      magnetic shielding means provided on the apparatus to And means
      disposed within the bio-electricity, magnetic adjustment device.<br>
      <br>
      The life energy modulation decoding method through germanium stone
      energy, thermal energy, far infrared and negative ions Human
      energy regulation of energy, as well as magnetic, bio-electricity,
      allowing to extend the life cycle of the cell, the use of
      Biochemical and electromagnetic field energy cell function
      relative will improve immunity, thus help us Body absorb more
      energy in order to reduce cell death. For example, healthy cells
      have 70mV of Voltage, and weakness or lack of nutrition in the
      cell membrane, only 30mV. 30MV membrane voltage can not be
      completely Transport nutrients, resulting in the phenomenon of
      cell lack of nutrients, and even cause cell death. Fine dead Cells
      may be new and active cells replace it. However, with increasing
      age, the body metabolism will The slower, the body will be easy to
      get sick or injured. The life energy modulation decoding method
      can use cell Electromagnetic energy and its biochemical features
      that make the cell's life cycle extension. By anion, germanium
      stone and Electrical adjustment and human biological magnetic
      field adjustment can be achieved...<br>
      <br>
      ...When the body's bio-energy field is disturbed, fine Membrane
      with a charge - across the membrane potential (TMP) will therefore
      decrease, healthy cells TMP about 70mV, Cancer TMP is 15mV or
      less, when the energy decreased, cell survival will be threatened,
      Start uncontrolled cell proliferation in order to survive. The
      life energy modulation decoding method can be magnetic body
      Bioelectric field adjustment and adjustment to eliminate the
      adverse effects of external magnetic fields and electromagnetic
      waves on the human body, strengthen and balance Body's bio-energy
      field.<br>
      <br>
      The present inventors believe that in the last 50 years, the
      average human body temperature between 36.5-36.8 ° C reduced
      Nearly 1 ° C, corresponding immunity reduced by 30%. If the
      average human body temperature on the basis of normal body
      temperature lift High 1 ° C, the immune system will increase 5-6
      times. As the body generates heat generation of heat, the
      temperature level to Off Important, the life energy modulation
      decoding method by precise temperature control device can be
      effective and precise mention L body temperature, enhance the body

      <b>&nbsp;<br>
      </b>Plastics are great. They can take any shape and serve an
      endless variety of roles. But... the beginning and end of a
      plastic’s life are problematic. While some plastics are made from
      renewable agricultural products, most are derived from petroleum.
      Plastics are not as easy to recycle as we'd like, and a huge
      percentage ends up in landfills (or the ocean), where they can be
      virtually immortal.<br>
      <br>
      The easy way to recycle plastic is to just rip it up, melt it
      down, and pour a new mold. But that only works when the plastic is
      all the same chemical type, which is a level of purity you rarely
      find in a recycling bin. Without separating plastics precisely
      into different types, you get a mixture that is much less useful
      than pure plastics. We’re limited in what we can make out of it.
      Other methods for recycling plastics require serious energy input,
      like high pressure and temperatures over 400°C. That can produce a
      variety of hydrocarbon compounds, but they can be difficult to
      work with.<br>
      <br>
      Recently, a team led by Xiangqing Jia of the Shanghai Institute of
      Organic Chemistry decided to try some chemical tricks to turn some
      of these plastics into something useful, even if it’s not more
      plastic. They worked with polyethylene, which makes up the
      majority of the plastic we use. Polyethylenes are essentially long
      chains made of repeating links of carbon, with hydrogen hanging
      off the side. The challenge is to break that resilient chain into
      shorter pieces so we can use the pieces to make other compounds.<br>
      <br>
      The new process involves two steps, each run by a catalyst. The
      first catalyst is a molecule including an atom of iridium. This
      catalyst pulls some of the hydrogens off the carbon backbone of a
      polyethylene. With the loss of these hydrogens, some of the
      single-electron-pair bonds between carbons become double bonds.
      That opens up a vulnerability for the second catalyst.<br>
      <br>
      That second catalyst, which can be based on atoms of rhenium and
      aluminum, teams up with some short chain petroleum compounds that
      the researchers added in. The long chain plastic is sliced at the
      double bond, and pieces of the short chain petroleum molecules are
      glued to either side. Where there was once a single, very long
      chain, there are now two chains.<br>
      <br>
      But the whole process is cyclical and doesn't stop there. The
      first catalyst releases some hydrogens as it pulls them off the
      plastic, which can be used to convert any double bonds back to
      single bonds. The same series of reactions can play out again.
      Repeat this for a few hours, and only shorter chain compounds
      remain. Heat does still have to be added to fuel this process, but
      temperatures around 150°C are sufficient.<br>
      <br>
      The end result is three basic types of compounds. There are very
      short chain compounds (things like butane) that can be used to get
      the reaction started for the next batch of plastic. (The catalysts
      can also be separated out and reused.) There are some longer chain
      wax compounds that are useful inputs for the plastics-making
      process. And in between, you get diesel fuel.<br>
      <br>
      By tuning different parts of the process, the researchers were
      able to control the proportion of wax vs. fuel that came out, as
      well as the range of wax compounds. Most of the plastic can easily
      be turned into fuel. Some of the chemicals that are added to
      plastics to modify their properties should be recoverable, too, so
      they can be used again.<br>
      <br>
      Of course, this isn’t as good as recycling plastics into further
      generations of plastics, particularly when the first generation
      was born of petroleum. But imagine if all the packaging your food
      came in could fuel the next shipment instead of clogging up
      landfills for centuries. And if we grew our plastics instead of
      pumping them from oil fields, we could get two for the renewable
      price of one.<b><br>

        Abstract<br>
        <br>
      </b>Polyethylene (PE) is the largest-volume synthetic polymer, and
      its chemical inertness makes its degradation by low-energy
      processes a challenging problem. We report a tandem catalytic
      cross alkane metathesis method for highly efficient degradation of
      polyethylenes under mild conditions. With the use of widely
      available, low-value, short alkanes (for example, petroleum
      ethers) as cross metathesis partners, different types of
      polyethylenes with various molecular weights undergo complete
      conversion into useful liquid fuels and waxes. This method shows
      excellent selectivity for linear alkane formation, and the
      degradation product distribution (liquid fuels versus waxes) can
      be controlled by the catalyst structure and reaction time. In
      addition, the catalysts are compatible with various polyolefin
      additives; therefore, common plastic wastes, such as postconsumer
      polyethylene bottles, bags, and films could be converted into
      valuable chemical feedstocks without any pretreatment.<br>

      <b><br>
      </b>MK ULTRA sleeper assassin Matthew Pauly discusses how the
      government used scopolamine to exert mind control over him to
      force him to kill, and the pattern of super soldiers and
      brainwashed killers being used to do secret government dirty work.
      How MK ULTRA agents can be recruited, recognized, and awakened,
      and the bizarre and chilling story of how Pauly’s life was turned
      upside down and his survival has continued to be threatened for
      knowing too much is illuminated on Buzzsaw, hosted by Sean Stone.<b><br>

            Renewable Energy</b></big><br>
      </div>
      <b><br>
      </b>Many say we can have 100% renewable energy by 2050. This is
      factually incorrect.<br>
      <br>
      We can have 100% renewable electricity production by 2050.<br>
      <br>
      But electricity production is only 18% of total world energy
      demand.<br>
      <br>
      82% of total world energy demand is NOT electricity production.<br>
      <br>
      The other 82% of the world’s energy is used to extract minerals to
      make roads, cement, bricks, glass, steel and grow food so we can
      eat and sleep. Solar panels and wind turbines will not be making
      cement or steel anytime soon. Why? Do you really want to know?
      Here we go.<br>
      TWED = Total World Energy Demand<br>
      <br>
      18% of TWED is electrical grid generation.<br>
      <br>
      82% of TWED is not electrical grid generation.<br>
      <br>
      In 20 years, solar &amp; wind energy is up from 1% to 3% of TWED.<br>
      <br>
      Solar &amp; wind power are projected to provide 6% of TWED by
      2030.<br>
      <br>
      When you hear stories about solar &amp; wind generating<br>
      50% of all humanity’s electrical power by 2050,<br>
      that’s really only 9% of TWED because<br>
      100% of electrical production is 18% of TWED.<br>
      <br>
      But, it takes 10X as much solar &amp; wind energy to close 1
      fossil fuel power plant simply because they don’t produce energy
      all the time.<br>

      <br>
      That means it will take 10 X 18% of TWED to close all fossil power
      plants with intermittent power.<br>
      <br>
      Research says it will take 4 X 82% of TWED for a 100% renewable
      energy transition. But then again, whoever trusts research?<br>
      <br>
      10 X 18% + 4 X 82% = 100% Renewable TWED.<br>
      <br>
      CONCLUSION:<br>
      <br>
      We require 10X the fossil electrical grid energy we use now just
      to solve 18% of the emissions problem with solar &amp; wind power.
      This also means that even if we use 100% efficient Carbon Capture
      and Storage (CCS) for all the world’s electricity generation, we
      would still only prevent 18% of our emissions. 100% efficient CCS
      is very unlikely. Switching to electric vehicles would only double
      electrical demand while most of our roads are made out of
      distilled oil sludge.<br>
      <br>
      These figures do not include massive electrical storage and grid
      infrastructure solar &amp; wind require. Such infrastructure is
      hundreds of millions of tons of materials taking decades to
      construct, demanding even more energy and many trillions of
      dollars. With that kind of money in the offing, you can see why
      some wax over-enthused.<br>
      <br>
      Solar &amp; wind systems last 30 years meaning we will always have
      to replace them all over the world again 50% sooner than fossil
      power plants.<br>
      <br>
      Solar and wind power are an energy trap.<br>
      <br>
      It takes 1 ton of coal to make 6-12 solar panels.<br>
      Business As Usual = BAU<br>
      <br>
      In 15 years 40% of humanity will be short of water with BAU.<br>
      <br>
      In 15 years 20% of humanity will be severely short of water.<br>
      <br>
      Right now, 1 billion people walk a mile every day for water.<br>
      <br>
      In 60 years humanity will not have enough soil to grow food says
      Scientific American. They call it, “The End of Human Agriculture.”
      Humanity’s soil is eroding and degrading away at 24 million acres
      per year.&nbsp; And, when they say 60 years they don’t mean
      everything is wonderful until the last day of the 59th year. We
      will feel the heat of those words in much less than 30 years. Soil
      loss rates will only increase with severe droughts, storms and
      low-land floods. Here’s what BAU really looks like.<br>
      <br>
      50% of humanity’s soil will be gone in 30 years.<br>
      <br>
      50% of humanity will lack water in 30 years.<br>
      <br>
      50% of humanity will go hungry in 30 years.<br>
      <br>
      A 100% TWED transition takes 50 years minimum. It is a vastly more
      difficult and complex goal than you are told.<br>

      We are losing earth’s soil and fresh water faster than we can
      effect 100% renewable TWED.<br>
      <br>
      In 25 years civilization will end says Lloyds of London and the
      British Foreign Office.<br>
      <br>
      In my opinion, in 30 years we won’t have enough fossil fuel for a
      100% renewable TWED transition.<br>
      <br>
      This is the most important fact I’ve learned:<br>
      <br>
      Renewable Energy is Unsustainable without massive energy demand
      destruction<br>
      <br>
      Humanity will destroy its soil and water faster than we can switch
      to renewable energy with BAU. We cannot sustain economic growth
      with renewable energy. Without massive political-economic change,
      civilization will collapse with 100% certainty. But, don’t worry,
      I like to fix things.<br>
      <br>
      Animal Agriculture = AA<br>
      <br>
      Humans + Livestock = 97% of the weight of all land vertebrate
      biomass<br>
      <br>
      Humans + Livestock = 80% of the cause of all land-air extinctions<br>
      <br>
      Humans + Livestock = 50% of the use of all land surface area<br>
      <br>
      Humans + Livestock = 40% consumption of all land plant growth *<br>
      * Net Primary Production.<br>
      <br>
      50% of the soy grown in South America is shipped over to China to
      feed their pigs. Rainforests and deep-rooted scrub are cleared to
      grow animals &amp; feed so that their required fresh water is in
      reality a sky river exported in boats to China and Europe leaving
      little moisture in the air to reach São Paulo. Since rainforest
      roots are so thick they don’t require very much, or even good,
      soil;&nbsp; this leaves rainforest soil so poor and thin that it
      degrades and erodes faster when exposed to the elements.<br>
      <br>
      The Himalayan mountains are heating 2X faster than the planet and
      many fear that China will run out of water in 15 years by 2030.<br>
      <br>
      50% of China’s rivers have vanished since 1980.<br>
      <br>
      60% of China’s groundwater is too poisoned to touch.<br>
      <br>
      50% of China’s cropland is too poisoned to safely grow food.<br>
      <br>
      Animal Agriculture will destroy our soil and water long before we
      can effect 100% intermittent TWED transition with BAU.<br>
      <br>
      BAU means 7 billion people will not stop eating meat and wasting
      food without major $$$ incentive. Meaning a steadily rising carbon
      tax on meat. Just saying that can get you killed in some places.<br>
      <br>
      Without using James Hansen’s 100% private tax dividends to carbon
      tax meat consumption out of the market earth will die. 100%
      private tax dividends means 100% for you, 0% for government.<br>
      <br>
      100% for you,<br>
      0% for gov.<br>
      <br>
      The funny thing is that meat and fire saved our ancestors from
      extinction and now meat and fire will cause mass extinction of all
      the life we love on earth. Survival is not an optional menu item
      as is eating meat. We have to act now, not 5 years from now, or
      forever be not remembered as the least greatest generation because
      there’ll be no one left to remember us.<br>
      <br>
      Michael Mann says we will lock-in a 2 degree temperature rise in 3
      years for 2036 with BAU. Ocean fish will be gone in less than 25
      years simply because of the BAU of meat consumption. The BAU of
      fishing kills everything in its path producing lots of waste kill.
      We are stealing all the Antarctic Ocean’s krill just to sell as a
      health supplement. You can learn a lot about fishing by watching
      “Cowspiracy” on Netflix.<br>
      <br>
      We cannot let governments get control of carbon markets like how
      Sanders, Klein and McKibben want government to get 40% of your
      carbon tax dividend money. Naomi Klein and Bill McKibben are
      funded by the Rockefellers. Klein’s latest video about herself was
      funded by the oil-invested Ford Foundation. This is 100% in direct
      opposition to James Hansen’s tax dividend plan and immoral. Hansen
      said that governments should get 0% of that money, not 40%.&nbsp;
      I strongly believe your carbon dividends should be in a new
      open-source world e-currency directly deposited to your phone to
      be phased in over 10 years. But, I’m kinda simple that way.<br>
      <br>
      Google: Rockefellers fund Bill McKibben. Believe me, the
      Rockefellers don’t fund 350.org out of the kindness of their
      hearts. To learn why they would do such a thing, you can watch the
      educational video at the bottom of this page.<br>

      James Hansen repeated at COP21 that his 100% private carbon tax
      dividends would unite Democrats and Republicans because government
      would be 100% excluded. Socialists like Sanders, Klein and
      McKibben want government to control 40% of that money. They are
      divisive and Republicans will never accept their revolutionary
      rhetoric. We don’t have time for this endless fighting. Forget the
      Socialist vs. Capitalist mentality. We barely even have time to
      unite, and nothing unites like money. Environmentalism in the 21st
      century is about a revolving door of money and power for elite
      socialists and capitalists. Let’s give everyone a chance to put
      some skin in the game.<br>

            Climate Catastrophe Will Hit Tropics Around 2020, Rest Of
            World Around 2047, Study Says</b></big><br>
      </div>
      <b><br>
      </b>
      <div align="center"><b>Eric Zuesse Investigative historian</b><br>
      </div>
      <b><br>
      </b>The first study to integrate all prior scientific research in
      order to project approximately when climate change will produce
      permanent catastrophic consequences has been accepted and will
      soon be published in the scientific journal Nature, and it finds
      that things will start going haywire in the tropics at around the
      year 2020, and in our part of the world at around 2047.<br>
      <br>
      Nature shares with Science and PNAS (Proceedings of the National
      Academy of Sciences) the distinction of being tied as the world’s
      three most prestigious scientific journals, and an article is not
      published in these journals unless it has undergone extremely
      rigorous scientific peer-revue; so, climate-change deniers will
      have no professional credibility in attacking this study, as the
      Koch brothers and their friends can reasonably be expected to do,
      since they profit so much from what causes global warming - the
      burning of carbon-based fuels.<br>
      <br>
      According to this study, the tropics, which are the
      near-equatorial region of this planet that’s almost 100%
      impoverished, and that has thus contributed virtually nothing to
      global warming, will begin the period of permanent catastrophe
      starting in approximately 2020; but the (cooler) moderate-latitude
      countries, such as in North America and Europe, will begin this
      catastrophic period in or around 2047.<br>
      <br>
      This isn’t to say that things won’t continue to get worse after
      then; it’s only to say that this is, as the article will be
      titled, “The projected timing of climate departure from recent
      variability.”<br>
      <br>
      This landmark article was co-authored by a team of 14
      climate-scientists. It says: “Unprecedented climates will occur
      earliest in the tropics and among low-income countries.” It
      explains that the reason for this is that the countries near the
      equator have far less variability in their weather than do the
      moderate-climate countries, and so the species that constitute the
      ecosystems there cannot tolerate temperatures outside their narrow
      range, which has existed within that narrow range for thousands of
      years. Consequently, species-extinctions will soar there much
      faster and earlier than here. The existing impoverished economies,
      within around 2,500 miles of the equator (where average per-capita
      incomes are less than 10% of the average in the moderate-latitude
      countries such as ours), will become unlivable…<b><br>

      is absolutely no limit that our own government will go to cover up
      their crimes against their own American citizens, and EVERYTHING
      the corporate / government-sponsored / controlled American main
      stream "media" reported about the tragedy was nothing but lies!
      They had, (and still have to this day), no problem murdering
      people,... even forcing innocent children to BURN ALIVE,...
      basically ANYTHING IT TAKES to insure there are no witnesses to
      their endless atrocities! I myself was personally flabbergasted
      after watching this and knew it must be shared with as many people
      as possible! If this film does not boil your blood,... quite
      frankly nothing will!!! WACO was an American abomination in every
      aspect! WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT! (age restricted) People under 18

      <div align="center"><big><b>New Alzheimer’s treatment fully
            restores memory function</b></big><br>
      </div>
      <b><br>
        <br>
      </b>Australian researchers have come up with a non-invasive
      ultrasound technology that clears the brain of neurotoxic amyloid
      plaques - structures that are responsible for memory loss and a
      decline in cognitive function in Alzheimer’s patients.<br>
      <br>
      If a person has Alzheimer’s disease, it’s usually the result of a
      build-up of two types of lesions - amyloid plaques, and
      neurofibrillary tangles. Amyloid plaques sit between the neurons
      and end up as dense clusters of beta-amyloid molecules, a sticky
      type of protein that clumps together and forms plaques. <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      Neurofibrillary tangles are found inside the neurons of the brain,
      and they’re caused by defective tau proteins that clump up into a
      thick, insoluble mass. This causes tiny filaments called
      microtubules to get all twisted, which disrupts the transportation
      of essential materials such as nutrients and organelles along
      them, just like when you twist up the vacuum cleaner tube.<br>
      <br>
      As we don’t have any kind of vaccine or preventative measure for
      Alzheimer’s - a disease that affects 343,000 people in Australia,
      and 50 million worldwide - it’s been a race to figure out how best
      to treat it, starting with how to clear the build-up of defective
      beta-amyloid and tau proteins from a patient’s brain. Now a team
      from the Queensland Brain Institute (QBI) at the University of
      Queensland have come up with a pretty promising solution for
      removing the former.<br>
      <br>
      Publishing in Science Translational Medicine, the team describes
      the technique as using a particular type of ultrasound called a
      focused therapeutic ultrasound, which non-invasively beams sound
      waves into the brain tissue. By oscillating super-fast, these
      sound waves are able to gently open up the blood-brain barrier,
      which is a layer that protects the brain against bacteria, and
      stimulate the brain’s microglial cells to activate. Microglila
      cells are basically waste-removal cells, so they’re able to clear
      out the toxic beta-amyloid clumps that are responsible for the
      worst symptoms of Alzheimer’s.<br>
      <br>
      The team reports fully restoring the memory function of 75 percent
      of the mice they tested it on, with zero damage to the surrounding
      brain tissue. They found that the treated mice displayed improved
      performance in three memory tasks - a maze, a test to get them to
      recognise new objects, and one to get them to remember the places
      they should avoid.<br>
      <br>
      "We’re extremely excited by this innovation of treating
      Alzheimer’s without using drug therapeutics," one of the team,
      Jürgen Götz, said in a press release. "The word ‘breakthrough’ is
      often misused, but in this case I think this really does
      fundamentally change our understanding of how to treat this
      disease, and I foresee a great future for this approach."<br>
      <br>
      The team says they’re planning on starting trials with higher
      animal models, such as sheep, and hope to get their human trials
      underway in 2017. <br>

            ultrasound</b></big><br>
      </div>
      <b><br>
      </b>A new way of treating Alzheimer's disease with ultrasound has
      been demonstrated in mice, clearing the amyloid plaques in 75% of
      the animals.<br>
      <br>
      Researchers at the Queensland Brain Institute (QBI), part of
      Australia's University of Queensland, have shown that non-invasive
      ultrasound technology can be used to treat Alzheimer's disease and
      restore memory in mice. This innovative, drug-free method breaks
      apart the neurotoxic amyloid plaques that result in memory loss
      and cognitive decline.<br>
      <br>
      “The Government’s $9 million investment into this technology was
      to drive discoveries into clinics, and today’s announcement
      indicates that together with the Queensland Brain Institute, it
      was a worthwhile investment,” said Queensland Premier, Annastacia
      Palaszczuk. “I want my Government to encourage more of this type
      of innovative research. Our Advance Queensland initiative aims to
      increase research and discoveries like this and to put this
      state’s research at the forefront internationally by supporting
      local researchers and helping to keep them in Queensland. These
      exciting findings will hopefully be of benefit to all Australians
      in the future.”<br>
      <br>
      Professor Jürgen Götz, study co-author, believes the new method
      could revolutionise Alzheimer’s treatment: “We’re extremely
      excited by this innovation of treating Alzheimer’s without using
      drug therapeutics. The ultrasound waves oscillate tremendously
      quickly, activating microglial cells that digest and remove the
      amyloid plaques that destroy brain synapses. The word
      ‘breakthrough’ is often mis-used, but in this case I think this
      really does fundamentally change our understanding of how to treat
      this disease, and I foresee a great future for this approach.”<br>
      <br>
      There are now 343,000 people living with dementia in Australia, a
      number forecast to reach 900,000 by 2050. Worldwide, the figure
      today is 50 million, which is projected to hit 135 million by
      2050, with Alzheimer’s among the leading causes. Over 7.7 million
      new cases are reported globally each year (equivalent to about one
      new case every four seconds) and the rate is accelerating as
      people live longer and their brains become more susceptible to
      this terrible condition. It will place enormous financial and
      other burdens on society in the future, unless new treatments can
      be developed.<br>

      <div align="center"><big><b>Scientists create light from vacuum</b></big><br>
      </div>
      <b><br>
      </b>…Chalmers scientist, Christopher Wilson and his co-workers
      have succeeded in getting photons to leave their virtual state and
      become real photons, i.e. measurable light. The physicist Moore
      predicted way back in 1970 that this should happen if the virtual
      photons are allowed to bounce off a mirror that is moving at a
      speed that is almost as high as the speed of light. The
      phenomenon, known as the dynamical Casimir effect, has now been
      observed for the first time in a brilliant experiment conducted by
      the Chalmers scientists.<br>
      <br>
      “Since it’s not possible to get a mirror to move fast enough,
      we’ve developed another method for achieving the same effect,”
      explains Per Delsing, Professor of Experimental Physics at
      Chalmers. “Instead of varying the physical distance to a mirror,
      we've varied the electrical distance to an electrical short
      circuit that acts as a mirror for microwaves.<br>
      <br>
      The “mirror” consists of a quantum electronic component referred
      to as a SQUID (Superconducting quantum interference device), which
      is extremely sensitive to magnetic fields. By changing the
      direction of the magnetic field several billions of times a second
      the scientists were able to make the “mirror” vibrate at a speed
      of up to 25 percent of the speed of light.<br>
      <br>
      “The result was that photons appeared in pairs from the vacuum,
      which we were able to measure in the form of microwave radiation,”
      says Per Delsing. “We were also able to establish that the
      radiation had precisely the same properties that quantum theory
      says it should have when photons appear in pairs in this way.”<br>
      <br>
      What happens during the experiment is that the “mirror” transfers
      some of its kinetic energy to virtual photons, which helps them to
      materialise. According to quantum mechanics, there are many
      different types of virtual particles in vacuum, as mentioned
      earlier. Göran Johansson, Associate Professor of Theoretical
      Physics, explains that the reason why photons appear in the
      experiment is that they lack mass...<b><br>

      </b>Young talent such as Lalita Prasida Sripada Srisai, a
      13-year-old from Odisha, India, who designed a water purifier that
      functions on waste corn cobs, is the type of inspiration needed in
      a world where most people are focused on consuming versus solving
      problems such as water contamination…<br>
      <br>
https://thelogicalindian.com/news/odisha-school-girl-wins-award-at-google-science-fair-for-developing-water-purifying-agent/<br>
      <br>
      Odisha School Girl Wins Award At Google Science Fair For
      Developing Water Purifying Agent<br>
      <br>
      ...Lalita developed a low cost bio-absorbent based water purifier.
      It functions mainly on waste corn cobs. The Corn cob is the least
      utilized part of the maize plant. It is a very important
      agricultural waste. Having high mechanical strength, rigidity and
      porosity, corn cob is a suitable absorbent. This enables
      contaminants like oxides of salts, detergent, suspended particles,
      coloured dyes, oil and grease to be absorbed in the surface of the
      corn cobs. Some of the heavy metals are also absorbed.<br>
      <br>
      “If the drain pipe of the household is connected to a chamber
      having different layers of corn cobs in partition layers or to an
      S-trap pipe having corn cobs, it will separate about more than
      70-80 % of contaminants including suspended particles from the
      waste water,” says the report published about her project on the
      Google Science Fair website.<br>
      <br>
      This cheap and eco-friendly way of purifying water will open up a
      new market for corn corbs which are otherwise discarded as
      bio-waste.<br>
      <br>
      To conduct the experiment, Lalita had collected the cobs from a
      nearby farm and sun dried them for a month. To make a hole at the
      centre of one cob, the pith was removed. In it 50 ml of domestic
      effluent collected from a kitchen drain pipe was poured. This was
      allowed to pass through the hole. Thereafter, the collected
      filtrate was tested for purity. This was the pilot stage.<br>
      <br>
      After its successful completion, water with several added chemical
      impurities was through five bottles, each containing a different
      layer for purification. The layers had long pieces of corn cobs,
      small pieces of corn cobs, powdered corn cobs, activated charcoal
      made from corn cobs and fine sand.<br>
      <br>
      The charcoal layer was observed to absorb most of the coloured
      substances present in the water, while the chaff layers of both
      long and small pieces of corn cobs absorbed the suspended
      particles. The powdered corn cob layer absorbed the gasoline
      waste.<br>

      <div align="center"><i>Engine startup LiquidPiston has radically
          shrunk a go-kart engine, but it's the military applications
          that has everyone really excited.</i><br>
      </div>
      <b><br>
      </b>Connecticut-based startup LiquidPiston announced today that
      they have built a small, compact engine that is powerful enough to
      drive a go-kart. Their X-mini engine weighs just 4 pounds and has
      three moving parts, and yet can produce 3 horsepower, enough to
      replace the default 40-pound piston engine that normally powers
      the go-kart.<br>
      <br>
      LiquidPiston says that their X-mini is still in a testing phase,
      and they hope to get the weight down to 3 pounds and the power up
      to 5 hp. (The 40-pound piston engine produces about 6.5 hp.) In
      the meantime, their little engine already packs a punch, as you
      can see in the video below.<br>
      <br>
      LiquidPiston announced last year that they received a $1 million
      DARPA grant to develop their X-mini engine, and it appears that
      they've succeeded. The 4-pound, 3-hp engine is small enough to fit
      in the palm of your hand, yet it can power everything from
      vehicles to generators to drones. The X-mini uses LiquidPiston's
      proprietary rotary engine design and thermodynamic cycle which
      offer vast improvements over both a traditional Wankel rotary
      engine and common piston engines.<br>
      <br>
      LiquidPiston says the X-mini can run on Jet Propellant 8, the
      military's fuel of choice, making it an ideal candidate for all
      sorts of military applications. For instance, the X-mini is small
      and light enough to power a UAV, it can be part of a generator
      that can be carried in a backpack, or it can even be used to power
      military robotics. According to Alec Shkolnik, LiquidPiston's
      co-founder and president, "[DARPA] is kinda agnostic as to the
      actual application … they have so many different applications that
      need power."<br>
      <br>
      Shkolnik said that the X-mini is still early in testing, and they
      have only just built their first working prototype, but he's
      hopeful that the engine could see a commercial release sometime in
      the next few years. When that happens, the X-mini could find its
      way into lawnmowers, emergency generators, and even small vehicles
      like mopeds. <b><br>

      <div align="center"><i>A new spin on the internal combustion
          engine by startup LiquidPiston aims for a leap in efficiency
          from 20 percent to 50 percent.</i><br>

      <b><br>
        <br>
      </b>As automakers augment the reciprocating piston engine with
      hybrid systems and improved accessories, independent inventors are
      busily working to make huge improvements to the basic efficiency
      of the internal combustion engine. Novel designs are popping up at
      engineering expos everywhere, and the newest comes from
      Bloomfield, Conn.-based LiquidPiston. Its X1 engine is a simple
      machine with just three moving parts and thirteen major
      components, but it aims to raise thermal efficiency from the 20
      percent of a normal gas engine to more than 50 percent, with
      drastic reductions in weight and size. How? By wasting much less
      energy during the course of an combustion cycle.<br>
      <br>
      Up to 80 percent of the energy in fossil fuels is thrown away
      normal engines through the heat and pressure of exhaust, or dumped
      to the atmosphere through the radiator. LiquidPiston's design
      attempt to capture all of that waste within a tiny package. "We
      stretched the performance curves in every direction to get much
      higher efficiency," said Alec Shkolnik, President and CEO of
      LiquidPiston, "We took the best parts of many different thermal
      cycles and combined them." The design is theoretically capable of
      75 percent thermal efficiency, but the group is targeting 57
      percent in real world applications, still a huge jump.<br>
      <br>
      The basic idea is similar to a Wankel rotary, but turned on its
      head. Where the rotor holds the seals in a normal Wankel, the
      housing does that job in the X1 engine. This allows significant
      reduction in oil consumption over a regular rotary motor. Other
      enhancements include direct injection, a high compression ratio at
      18:1, and a dramatic change to the geometry of the combustion
      chamber, which maintains a constant volume during ignition. This
      change means the air-fuel mixture auto-ignites like a diesel, and
      can be burned much longer than normal. The result is a more
      complete combustion ending in low emissions and very high chamber
      pressures. This high pressure is allowed to act on the rotor until
      it reaches nearly atmospheric pressures, so almost all the
      available energy is extracted before the exhaust is physically
      pushed out. Again, this is different than a normal internal
      combustion engine, which releases very energetic, high-pressure
      exhaust gas.<br>
      <br>
      Some other slick features: Since the engine is designed to convert
      so much more heat energy into mechanical force, less heat has to
      be removed from the block, so there's actually no water cooling
      system. In cases where the engine is under load and needs to cool
      down, it can skip an fuel injection event and just suck in cool
      air, which is then heated by the block and gets exhausted. Another
      option is to inject water into the combustion chamber. This has
      three effects: cooling the engine, reducing NOx emissions, and
      converting some of the water to steam, which increases power.<br>
      <br>
      The compact design of LiquidPiston's lab engine currently tips the
      scales at 80 lbs for the 40-hp model. It would weigh less than 50
      lbs in production, the company claims, far less than a comparable
      40-hp diesel that would tip the scale at around 400 lbs.
      LiquidPiston's current aim is to continue developing the engine
      with an eye on the sub-100 hp market—compressors, hybrid
      range-extenders, military applications, boat engines—and license
      the intellectual property to manufacturing customers. We love
      seeing plucky inventors like these to completely rethinking the
      gasoline engine.<b><br>

      “Freedom Go To Hell!” “Prepare For The REAL Holocaust!” and
      “Annihilate [massacre, exterminate/butcher/behead] those who would
      insult Islam!” In the name of humanity, Islam must be put to
      death. Not by nuking, but by shaming. Not by the sword (though if
      the maggots leave us no alternative we should not hesitate to use
      it) but by the word. Human beings worthy of the title must rise up

      primitivism! We who are civilized are revolted by it and shall
      rebuff it at every turn!” Muslims must discover rationality and
      decency; Westerners must rediscover them, and, as a matter of
      urgency, speak up for them! All that is necessary for evil to
      triumph is for cowards to appease it—and Islam is the locus of
      evil in the contemporary world. <br>

        </big></div>
      <b><big> </big><br>
      </b>Q: Can you be specific on what the Andromedan viewpoint is on
      Christianity, especially in view of the fact that they have
      holographic access to all events that have happened on Earth? I
      mean, what are some of the specifics?<br>
      <br>
      A: You know, I don't like talking about this, because I was raised
      a Catholic. I was an altar boy. The truth broke my heart. You
      know, to find out that what I thought was reality really wasn't.
      Where I'm at with it is very personal, but I'm not counting on
      anybody to come down and save me. The Andromedan perspective of
      the whole scenario is really different that what we've been told.<br>
      <br>
      Q: Well, it's apparent that there were several characters in
      history with the name Yeshua, translated loosely as "Jesus".
      There's Yeshua Ben Joseph, etc. How did all this develop?<br>
      <br>
      A: Okay. Basically what happened was that the Catholic church
      created a composite character, because at the time they were
      expending a lot of resources putting out religious wars. It seemed
      like a good idea at the time, but like many things it got
      perverted. Yeshua Ben Joseph, was a Jewish rabbi who lived from
      70BC to 9 BC. He was apparently crucified at some point, charged
      with being a thief.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
      Prior to that there was a man by the name of&nbsp; Rabbi Hallel
      who apparently died in 100BC. Rabbi Hallel was called "The Great
      Teacher". Many Christians are led to believe that a man named
      Jesus was called this, when in fact it was Rabbi Hallel. Now, what
      happened was that the New Testament composite character of "Jesus
      The Christ" was created by the Council of Nicea.<br>
      <br>
      Most of the words that are attributed to this composite character,
      referred to colloquially as "Jesus", were in fact spoken by
      Apollonius of Tyana, who the Bible calls "Paul of Tarsus". Because
      Rome had their armies scattered all over the place and all these
      wars were over the subject of religion, what the Council of Nicea
      decided to do is essentially create a "State Religion".<br>
      <br>
      So, what they did was combine the religions of the east and the
      west, both of which were concerned with Sun worship. Those in the
      West worshipped Hesos, also called Hess. Those in the East that
      worshipped the Sun worshipped Krishna, which in Greek is called
      Kristos. The very first "Bible" that was put together in 325AD.<br>
      <br>
      They took some books that Apollonius of Tyana had brought back
      from Burma, called the Codes of the Initiates (which concerned
      themselves with man's relationship to the seasons, among other
      things) containing lessons that were handed down to those
      particular Holy Men in India during that particular period in
      history. The Codes of the Initiates allegedly contained words that
      were spoken by Krishna. The very first "Bible" was called the
      Helios Biblios, which means "The Sun Book". This is what they did
      in the very beginning.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
      Q: When was the Helios Biblios assembled?<br>
      <br>
      A: Between 324 and 355 AD, by the Council of Nicea under Emperor
      Constantine The Great. Then they slowly developed a "God", a
      personage, to replace the Sun, and slowly changed the books,
      disposing of the material detailing reincarnation and many of the
      other teachings. They changed meanings, and every scribe that
      worked on this thing kept changing things as belief systems were
      revised with the prevailing times.<br>
      <br>
      Q: How about things ascribed to the historical "Jesus" such as the
      Sermon on the Mount?<br>
      <br>
      A: The exact words ascribed to the historical "Jesus" with
      reference to the Sermon on the Mount were found in a Turkish
      museum, authored by a Greek Senator in 64 AD. The Church went out
      a gathered all the information they could at various times in
      history, and they suppressed what they didn't agree with or what
      they didn't want the people to know.<br>
      <br>
      Q: Then, who was the healer in this whole scenario?<br>
      <br>
      A: That was Apollonius of Tyana, who the Catholic Church referred
      to as the "Anti-Christ", despite the fact that he was also known
      as Paul of Tarsus, mainly because he encouraged rebellion against
      Roman tyranny.<br>
      <br>
      Q: And Yeshua Ben Joseph?<br>
      <br>
      A: From what I understand, he was of the royal line, but he tried
      to create rebellion against Roman tyranny as well. Now, there was
      also another Yeshua.<br>
      <br>
      Q: Another Yeshua?<br>
      <br>
      A: Yes. It was a very common name than in Judea. He was a rabbi
      who was also a rebel, of sorts. He died at Massada in 64 AD, and
      his presence at Massada was why Massada was attacked. His name was
      Yeshua Malathiel. The bottom line is there was no "Jesus Christ"
      in history at all. It was a composite character, and history
      reveals this fact.<br>
      <br>
      Q: Now, Robert Morning Sky revealed that the specific crucifixion
      that involved a Yeshua was a mock crucifixion, in that the person
      did not really die, because he was given an herbal mixture to
      simulate death, and that Bar Abbas was in fact the son of the
      Yeshua concerned here.<br>
      <br>
      A: Yes, if you take the name Bar Abbas, which is a two-word name
      (not Barrabas, as in the Biblical product of the Roman Church),
      and you go back to the ancient Hebrew, it means "Son of the
      Teacher" or "Son of the Master".<br>
      <br>
      Q: So whose son was Bar Abbas?<br>
      <br>
      A: Yeshua Melethiel.<br>
      <br>
      Q: His son.<br>
      <br>
      A: Yes, and from that grew the lineage in France.<br>
      <br>
      Q: The lineage in France? That is where Alex Christopher's book
      Pandora's Box picks the trail up. The so-called "bloodline of
      Christ" that related to the mission of the Templars.<br>
      <br>
      A: That's right. It related not to Yeshua (Jesus) Malathiel
      himself, who died at Massada in 64 AD, but to his son, Bar Abbas,
      who survived and went to France.<br>
      <br>
      Q: This is also connected with the "blue-bloods" and
      extraterrestrial genetics?<br>
      <br>
      A: That's exactly right.<br>
      <br>
      Q: So Yeshua Malathiel was a "blue-blood"?<br>
      <br>
      A: Yes, he was, and he was connected to the House of David, and if
      you go all the way back through the line, through David, and you
      get to Moses, who was a human-extraterrestrial "half-breed".<br>
      <br>
      Q: So, was it Yeshua Malathiel who was involved in the "cross
      scenario"?<br>
      <br>
      A: I don't know for sure. The only place I have heard of the story
      that Robert is talking about is from a book called Crucifixion By
      An Eyewitness (which does not at all imply that Robert got his
      data from that book, just that the book mentions it)<br>
      <br>
      But, the Essenes were herbalists and knew how to mix potions and
      knew about this kind of thing. Of course, the real secrets about
      all of this lie in the Dead Sea Scrolls.<br>
      <br>
      Q: Which the Israeli government have locked up, or at least most
      of them, and will only let a few select people see a few of them.<br>
      <br>
      A: Yes, by the Israeli's and the Roman Church, because what the
      Dead Sea Scrolls show, according to the Andromedans, are that
      "Christianity" and "Judaism" were really one thing, one religion,
      and they also tell the true story of who Yeshua was, as we have
      spoken about here.<br>
      <br>
      Q: Yeshua Malathiel?<br>
      <br>
      A: Right. Rabbi Wise in the 1950's and 1960's did an extensive
      study of the death warrants and death certificates of those who
      were crucified during that time period, as the Romans kept
      records, and the only Yeshua listed as being crucified was a man
      coincidentally named Yeshua Malathiel, who was listed as a traitor
      and a thief. Mary of the house of Magdelana was the wife of Yeshua
      Malathiel.<br>
      <br>
      She came from a very well-to-do family who raised doves for
      sacrifices put on by the Pharisees at the temples. I think the
      book Holy Grail talks a little about that, too. The Jewish
      tradition was at that time that any man 13 years of age, who was a
      rabbi, must take a wife and have children. That was the law.<br>
      <br>
      Q: How did the crucifixion scenario arise with Yeshua Malathiel
      and his son, Bar Abbas?<br>
      <br>
      A: Well, the story behind that is that they took Bar Abbas because
      they knew that the father, Yeshua, would come after his son. The
      story goes on to say that a ransom was paid, and they did a "mock"
      crucifixion in order to hide the fact of a payoff to the Romans.<br>
      <br>
      Malathiel did not leave the area. He continued to do what he did
      and died at Massada. There is apparently a scroll which is in the
      possession of the Russians that proves this, and the son, Bar
      Abbas, was escorted to France with the rest of the family.<br>
      <br>
      Q: So, presuming that somewhere along the line Christians or Jews
      would read this material, what would you say to them if they feel
      concerned by it?<br>
      <br>
      A: Well, all I would say is that true history does not support the
      idea or the proof that a "Jesus Christ" lived. It does prove that
      Apollonius of Tyana was real, and the other thing I would say is,
      "you've been duped". There is no middle man between you and the
      Creator, and your relationship is directly with the Creator.<br>
      <br>
      Q: Of course, this is why Gnosticism has been so suppressed
      throughout history.<br>
      <br>
      A: Yes. These "churches" exist only because people "believe in
      them" and support them financially. If you take that away and say,
      "my relationship is with the Creator, I don't need a middle man",
      then "there is no need for you." Let's face it, the church is
      politics and a form of government.<br>
      <br>
      The Andromedans share very much the same viewpoint as some of the
      Pleaidian groups - that all religions on our planet are forms of
      government, and they don't see any difference between government
      and politics (power-brokering), in their perspective. I mean,
      people used to have to pay priests in order to "assure their place
      in heaven".<br>
      <br>
      Q: Are there any religious systems on this planet that are at all
      beneficial?<br>
      <br>
      A: There are two religious systems they say have been beneficial,
      and they were the original form of Buddhism and the original form
      of Shinto. All the other stuff is designed to hold you back and
      control you. That is their perception. <b><br>

        States&nbsp; Code&nbsp; as agencies of the Department of the
        Treasury for the United States ---<br>
        <br>
        Not Created by Congress<br>
      </b><br>
      The Bureau&nbsp; of Internal&nbsp; Revenue, and&nbsp; the
      alleged&nbsp; Internal Revenue Service,&nbsp; were not&nbsp;
      created by&nbsp; Congress.&nbsp;&nbsp; These are not organizations
      or&nbsp; agencies of&nbsp; the Department of the Treasury, or of
      the&nbsp; federal government.&nbsp;&nbsp; They&nbsp; appear to be
      operated through pure trusts&nbsp; administered by&nbsp; the
      Secretary&nbsp; of the Treasury (the Trustee).&nbsp;&nbsp; The
      Settler&nbsp; of the&nbsp; trusts and&nbsp; the&nbsp;
      Beneficiary&nbsp; or Beneficiaries are&nbsp;
      unknown.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp;
      law&nbsp; governing trusts, the information does not have to be
      revealed.<b><br>
        <br>
        Not Found in 31 U.S.C.<br>
        <br>
      </b>The organization of the Department of&nbsp; the Treasury can
      be found in 31 United States Code, Chapter 3, beginning on page 7.
      You will&nbsp; not find the Bureau of Internal Revenue, the
      Internal Revenue Service, the Secret Service, or the Bureau of
      Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms listed. We learned that the Bureau of
      Internal Revenue, Internal Revenue, internal revenue,&nbsp;
      Internal Revenue Service, the Bureau of Internal Revenue Service,
      internal revenue service, Official Internal Revenue Service, the
      Federal Alcohol Administration, Director Alcohol Tobacco and
      Firearms Division, and the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms
      are all one organization. We found this obfuscated.<br>
      <b><br>
        Constructive Fraud<br>
        <br>
      </b>The investigation&nbsp; found that, except for&nbsp; the very
      few who are engaged in specific activities, the Citizens of the 50
      States of the United States of America have never been required to
      file or to pay "income taxes." The Federal government is engaged
      in constructive fraud on a massive scale.&nbsp; Americans who have
      been frightened into filing and paying "income taxes" have been
      robbed of their money.&nbsp; Millions of lives have been ruined…<br>
      <b><br>
        Philippine -- Trust #1<br>
      </b><br>
      In the&nbsp; last century, the United States acquired by conquest
      the territory&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Philippine Islands, Guam, and
      Puerto Rico. The Philippine&nbsp; Customs Administrative&nbsp;
      Act&nbsp; was&nbsp; passed&nbsp; by&nbsp; the Philippine
      Commission&nbsp; during the&nbsp; period from September 1, 1900,
      to August&nbsp; 31, 1902, to regulate trade with foreign countries
      and to create&nbsp; revenue in&nbsp; the form&nbsp; of duties,
      imposts, and excises. The Act&nbsp; created the federal
      government's first trust fund called Trust Fund&nbsp; #1,
      the&nbsp; Philippine special fund (customs duties), 31 U.S.C.,
      Section 1321.&nbsp; The Act was administered under the general
      supervision and control of the Secretary of Finance and Justice.<br>
      <b><br>
        Philippine Trust #2<br>
        Bureau of Internal Revenue<br>
      </b><br>
      The Philippine&nbsp; Commission passed&nbsp; another Act&nbsp;
      known as the Internal Revenue&nbsp; Law of&nbsp; Nineteen
      Hundred&nbsp; and Four.&nbsp;&nbsp; This&nbsp; Act created&nbsp;
      the&nbsp;&nbsp; Bureau&nbsp; of&nbsp;&nbsp; Internal&nbsp;
      Revenue&nbsp;&nbsp; and&nbsp; the&nbsp; federal government's&nbsp;
      second&nbsp;&nbsp; trust&nbsp; fund&nbsp; called&nbsp; Trust&nbsp;
      Fund&nbsp; #2,&nbsp; the Philippine special&nbsp; fund
      (internal&nbsp; revenue), 31&nbsp; U.S.C., Section 1321.&nbsp; In
      the Act, Article I, Section 2, we find:<br>
      <b><br>
      </b>"There shall&nbsp; be established&nbsp; a Bureau&nbsp; of
      Internal Revenue,&nbsp; the chief&nbsp; officer of&nbsp; which
      Bureau&nbsp; shall be&nbsp; known as&nbsp; the Collector of
      Internal Revenue. He shall be appointed by the Civil&nbsp;
      Governor,&nbsp; with&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; advice&nbsp; and&nbsp;
      consent&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Philippine Commission,&nbsp; and
      shall&nbsp; receive a&nbsp; salary at&nbsp; the&nbsp; rate
      of&nbsp; eight thousand&nbsp; pesos per&nbsp; annum.&nbsp;
      The&nbsp; Bureau&nbsp; of Internal Revenue&nbsp; shall
      belong&nbsp; to the department of Finance and Justice."<b><br>
        <br>
        And in Section 3, we find:<br>
        <br>
      </b>"The Collector&nbsp; of Internal&nbsp; Revenue, under the
      direction of the Secretary&nbsp; of Finance&nbsp; and
      Justice,&nbsp; shall have&nbsp; general superintendence of&nbsp;
      the assessment&nbsp; and&nbsp; collection&nbsp; of&nbsp; all taxes
      and&nbsp; excises&nbsp; imposed&nbsp; by&nbsp; this&nbsp;
      Act&nbsp; or&nbsp; by&nbsp; any&nbsp; Act amendatory
      thereof,&nbsp; and shall&nbsp; perform such other duties as may be
      required by law."<b><br>
        <br>
        Customs &amp; BIR Merged<br>
        <br>
      </b>It is&nbsp; clear that the Customs Administrative Act was to
      fall within the&nbsp; jurisdiction of&nbsp; the Bureau of Internal
      Revenue which bureau was&nbsp; to be&nbsp; responsible for "all
      taxes and excises imposed by this&nbsp; Act," which&nbsp; clearly
      included&nbsp; import and&nbsp; export excise taxes.&nbsp;&nbsp;
      This effectively&nbsp; merged Customs and Internal Revenue in the
      Philippines.<b><br>
        <br>
        Internal Revenue (Puerto Rico)<br>
        <br>
      </b>At some&nbsp; unknown date&nbsp; prior&nbsp; to&nbsp;
      1940,&nbsp; another&nbsp; Bureau&nbsp; of Internal Revenue&nbsp;
      was established in Puerto Rico.&nbsp; The 62nd trust fund
      was&nbsp; created and&nbsp; named Trust&nbsp; fund #62&nbsp;
      Puerto Rico special<br>
      fund (Internal&nbsp; Revenue).&nbsp; Note that the Puerto Rico
      special fund has Internal&nbsp; Revenue, capital&nbsp; "I"&nbsp;
      and&nbsp; "R".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; Philippine special fund
      (internal revenue) is in lower-case letters.<br>
      <br>
      Between 1904&nbsp; and 1938,&nbsp; the China&nbsp; Trade Act&nbsp;
      was passed to deal with&nbsp; opium, cocaine, and citric wines
      shipped out of China. It appears&nbsp; to have&nbsp; been
      administered&nbsp; in the Philippines by the Bureau of Internal
      Revenue.<b><br>
        <br>
        China Trade Act<br>
      </b><br>
      We studied&nbsp; a copy of The Code of Federal Regulations of the
      United States&nbsp; of America&nbsp; in force&nbsp; June 1,&nbsp;
      1938, Title&nbsp; 26&nbsp; -- Internal Revenue,&nbsp; Chapter
      I&nbsp; -- (Parts&nbsp; 1-137).&nbsp;&nbsp; On page 65, it makes
      reference&nbsp; to the&nbsp; China Trade Act, where we find the
      first use of&nbsp; such terms&nbsp; as: income,&nbsp; credits,
      withholding, Assessment and Collection&nbsp; of
      Deficiencies,&nbsp; extension of&nbsp; time for payment, and
      failure&nbsp; to file&nbsp; return.&nbsp;&nbsp; The entire&nbsp;
      substance of Title 26 deals with&nbsp; foreign individuals,&nbsp;
      foreign&nbsp; corporations,&nbsp; foreign insurance corporations,
      foreign ships, income from sources within possessions of&nbsp;
      United States,&nbsp; citizens of the United States and domestic
      corporations&nbsp; deriving&nbsp; income&nbsp; from&nbsp;
      sources&nbsp; within&nbsp; a possession&nbsp; of&nbsp;&nbsp;
      the&nbsp; United&nbsp;&nbsp; States,&nbsp; and&nbsp;&nbsp;
      China&nbsp;&nbsp; Trade&nbsp;&nbsp; Act Corporations.<b><br>
        <br>
        Narcotics, Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms<br>
        <br>
      </b>All of&nbsp; the&nbsp; taxes&nbsp; covered&nbsp; by&nbsp;
      these&nbsp; laws&nbsp; concerned&nbsp; the imposts, excise&nbsp;
      taxes, and&nbsp; duties to be collected by the Bureau of&nbsp;
      Internal&nbsp; Revenue&nbsp; for&nbsp; such&nbsp; items&nbsp;
      as&nbsp; narcotics,&nbsp; alcohol, tobacco, and&nbsp;
      firearms.&nbsp;&nbsp; The alleged&nbsp; Internal&nbsp;
      Revenue&nbsp; Service likes to&nbsp; make a&nbsp; big do about the
      fact that Al Capone was jailed for tax&nbsp; evasion.&nbsp;&nbsp;
      The IRS will not tell you that the tax Capone evaded was not
      "income tax" as we know it, but the tax due on the income from the
      alcohol which he had imported from Canada. If he had paid the tax,
      he would not have been convicted.&nbsp; The Internal Revenue
      Act&nbsp; of&nbsp; 1939&nbsp; was&nbsp; clearly&nbsp;
      concerned&nbsp; with&nbsp; all&nbsp; taxes, imposts,
      excises,&nbsp; and duties&nbsp; collected&nbsp; on&nbsp;
      trade&nbsp; between&nbsp; the possessions and&nbsp; territories
      of&nbsp; the United&nbsp; States, and&nbsp; foreign individuals,
      foreign&nbsp; corporations, or&nbsp; foreign governments.&nbsp;
      The income tax&nbsp; laws have&nbsp; always applied&nbsp; only
      to&nbsp; the&nbsp; Philippines, Puerto Rico, District of Columbia,

      and another in Puerto Rico.&nbsp;&nbsp; Events&nbsp; that

      </b>The fiction,&nbsp; "that because&nbsp; it was&nbsp; an
      excise&nbsp; tax, it&nbsp; was legal," is&nbsp; not
      true.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; power of&nbsp; the federal&nbsp;
      government is limited to&nbsp; its own&nbsp; property, as stated
      in Article I, Section 8, Clause 17,&nbsp; and to&nbsp; "regulate
      Commerce&nbsp; with foreign Nations, and among the several States,
      and with the Indian tribes;"&nbsp; as stated in Article&nbsp; I,
      Section&nbsp; 8, Clause&nbsp; 3.&nbsp;&nbsp; 18 U.S.C.,&nbsp;
      Section&nbsp; 921, Definitions, states,&nbsp;&nbsp; "The term
      'interstate or foreign commerce' includes commerce&nbsp; between
      any&nbsp; place in&nbsp; a State&nbsp; and any&nbsp; place outside
      that State, or within any possession of the United States (not
      including&nbsp; the Canal&nbsp; Zone) or the District of Columbia,
      but such term&nbsp; does not&nbsp; include commerce&nbsp; between
      places&nbsp; within the same State but through any place outside
      of that State.&nbsp; The term 'State' includes&nbsp; the
      District&nbsp; of Columbia,&nbsp; the Commonwealth of Puerto
      Rico,&nbsp; and the&nbsp; possessions&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp;
      United&nbsp; States&nbsp; (not including the&nbsp; Canal

        BIR becomes IRS<br>

      </b>In 1953, the United States relinquished its control over the
      Philippines.&nbsp;&nbsp; Why do&nbsp; the Philippine&nbsp;
      pure&nbsp; Trusts&nbsp; #1&nbsp; (customs duties) and&nbsp; #2
      (internal&nbsp; revenue) continue&nbsp; to be&nbsp; administered
      today?&nbsp;&nbsp; Who are&nbsp; the Settlers&nbsp; of the
      Trusts?&nbsp; What is done with the funds&nbsp; in the&nbsp;
      Trusts?&nbsp;&nbsp; What businesses,&nbsp; if any,&nbsp; do&nbsp;
      these Trusts operate?&nbsp;&nbsp; Who&nbsp; are the
      Beneficiaries?&nbsp; Coincidentally, on July 9,&nbsp; 1953,
      the&nbsp; Secretary of the Treasury, G. K. Humphrey, by "virtue
      of&nbsp; the authority&nbsp; vested in me," changed the name of
      the Bureau of&nbsp; the Internal Revenue, BIR, to Internal Revenue
      Service when he&nbsp; signed what&nbsp; is now&nbsp; Treasury
      Order 150-06.&nbsp; This was an obvious attempt&nbsp; to
      legitimize&nbsp; the Bureau&nbsp; of Internal&nbsp; Revenue.
      Without the&nbsp; approval of&nbsp; Congress or&nbsp; the&nbsp;
      President,&nbsp; Humphrey, without any&nbsp; legal
      authority,&nbsp; tried to turn a pure trust into an agency
      of&nbsp; the Department&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Treasury.&nbsp;&nbsp;
      His&nbsp; actions&nbsp; were illegal, but&nbsp; went
      unchallenged.&nbsp;&nbsp; Did&nbsp; he change the name of the BIR
      in Puerto Rico or the BIR in the Philippines?&nbsp; We cannot find
      the answer.<b><br>

        Mutual Security Act<br>

      </b>In 1954,&nbsp; the United&nbsp; States and&nbsp; Guam became
      partners under the Mutual&nbsp; Security Act.&nbsp;&nbsp;
      The&nbsp; Act&nbsp; and&nbsp; other&nbsp; documents&nbsp; make
      reference to&nbsp; the definition&nbsp; of Guam&nbsp; and
      the&nbsp; United States&nbsp; as being mutually&nbsp;
      interchangeable.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the same year, the Internal
      Revenue Code&nbsp; of 1954&nbsp; was passed.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp;
      Code provides&nbsp; for&nbsp; the United States and Guam to
      coordinate the "Individual Income Tax". Pertinent
      information&nbsp; on the tax issue may be found in 26 C.F.R.

      Constitution forbids unapportioned direct taxes upon the Citizens
      of the&nbsp; several States of the 50 States of the Union;&nbsp;
      therefore, the federal&nbsp; government must&nbsp; trick
      (read&nbsp; "defraud") people into volunteering to&nbsp; pay taxes
      as "U.S. citizens" of either Guam, the Virgin Islands, or Puerto
      Rico.&nbsp; It sounds insane, and it is, but it is absolutely

      Firearms.&nbsp;&nbsp; He did this with the stroke of&nbsp; his
      pen,&nbsp; citing "by virtue of the authority vested in me

      etc.)&nbsp; Mr. Walker then makes a statement within T.O. 120-01
      that is very revealing:<br>
      <br>
      "The&nbsp; terms&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Director,&nbsp; Alcohol,&nbsp;&nbsp;

      use on the effective date of this Order, shall be held to mean

      <br>
      Walker seemed&nbsp; to branch the Internal Revenue Service (IRS),
      creating the&nbsp; Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (BATF),
      and then, with&nbsp; that statement,&nbsp; joined them&nbsp; back
      together into one. In the&nbsp; Federal Register,&nbsp; Volume
      41,&nbsp; Number 180,&nbsp; of Wednesday, September 15,&nbsp;
      1976, we&nbsp; find:&nbsp;&nbsp; "The&nbsp; term&nbsp;

        The Gift of the Magi</b><br>
      <br>
      This is&nbsp; how the&nbsp; Magi perform&nbsp; magic.&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Secretary Humphrey, with no&nbsp; authority, creates&nbsp; an
      agency&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Department of the Treasury called
      "Internal Revenue Service", out of thin air, from an
      offshore&nbsp; pure trust called "Bureau of Internal
      Revenue".&nbsp; The "Settler" and&nbsp; "Beneficiaries" of&nbsp;
      the trust&nbsp; are unknown.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The "Trustee"
      is&nbsp; the Secretary&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Treasury.&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Acting Secretary Walker further&nbsp; launders the&nbsp; trust by
      creating, from the alleged "Internal Revenue&nbsp; Service",
      the&nbsp; "Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms."<br>
      <b><br>
        Person Becomes Thing<br>
        <br>
      </b>Unlike Humphrey,&nbsp; however, Walker&nbsp; assuaged
      himself&nbsp; of&nbsp; any guilt when he nullified the order by
      proclaiming:<br>
      <br>
      "The&nbsp; terms&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Director,&nbsp; Alcohol,&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Tobacco&nbsp; and&nbsp;&nbsp; Firearms Division' and&nbsp;

      2&nbsp; hereof,&nbsp; which&nbsp; are&nbsp; in effect or&nbsp; in
      use on the effective date of this Order, shall be held to mean
      'the Director'."<br>
      <br>
      Walker created&nbsp; the Bureau&nbsp; of Alcohol, Tobacco and
      Firearms from the Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms Division of
      Humphrey's Internal Revenue Service.&nbsp;&nbsp; He then says
      that, what was transferred is the same entity&nbsp; as the
      Commissioner of Internal Revenue.&nbsp; He knew he could not&nbsp;
      legally create&nbsp; something&nbsp; from&nbsp; nothing&nbsp;
      without&nbsp; the authority of&nbsp; Congress and/or&nbsp; the
      President,&nbsp; so he made it look like he&nbsp; did
      something&nbsp; that he&nbsp; had, in&nbsp; fact,&nbsp; not&nbsp;
      done.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To compound&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp;
      fraud,&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; Federal&nbsp; Register&nbsp;&nbsp;
      published&nbsp;&nbsp; the unbelievable assertion&nbsp; that
      a&nbsp; person had&nbsp; been replaced&nbsp; with a thing:&nbsp;
      "the term Director Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms Division has been
      replaced with the term Internal Revenue Service."<b><br>
        <br>
        Stroke of Genius<br>
      </b><br>
      The Federal&nbsp; Alcohol Administration,&nbsp; which administered
      the Federal Alcohol&nbsp; Act, and&nbsp; offices of&nbsp; members
      and&nbsp; Administrator thereof, were&nbsp; abolished and&nbsp;
      their functions were directed to be administered under&nbsp;
      direction and supervision of the Secretary of Treasury through the
      Bureau of Internal Revenue, now the Internal Revenue&nbsp;
      Service.&nbsp; The Federal Alcohol Act was ruled unconstitutional
      within&nbsp; the 50&nbsp; States, so it was transferred to the
      BIR,&nbsp; which is an offshore trust, which became the IRS, which
      gave birth&nbsp; to the BATF and, somehow, the term Director,
      Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms Division, which is a person within
      the BATF, spawned the alleged Internal Revenue Service via another
      flick of the pen on September 15, 1976.<br>
      <br>
      In a&nbsp; brilliant flash&nbsp; of logic, Wayne C. Bentson
      determined that&nbsp; he&nbsp;&nbsp; could&nbsp; check&nbsp;
      these&nbsp; facts&nbsp; by&nbsp; filing&nbsp; a&nbsp;
      Freedom&nbsp; of Information Act&nbsp; ("FOIA") request,&nbsp;
      asking the&nbsp; BATF to "name the person who&nbsp; now
      administers the Federal Alcohol Act."&nbsp; If we were wrong,
      then&nbsp; a reply&nbsp; would state that no record exists as to
      any name of&nbsp; any person&nbsp; who administers&nbsp; the
      Act.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; request was submitted to the
      BATF.&nbsp; The reply came on July 14, 1994, from the Secret&nbsp;
      Service,&nbsp;&nbsp; an&nbsp; unexpected&nbsp;&nbsp; source,&nbsp;
      which&nbsp;&nbsp; discloses&nbsp; a connection we&nbsp; had
      not&nbsp; suspected.&nbsp;&nbsp; The reply&nbsp; states that&nbsp;
      John Magaw of&nbsp; the Bureau&nbsp; of Alcohol,&nbsp; Tobacco
      and&nbsp; Firearms, of&nbsp; the Department of&nbsp; the Treasury,
      administers the Federal Alcohol Act. You may&nbsp; remember
      from&nbsp; the Waco&nbsp; hearings that John Magaw is the
      Director, Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.&nbsp; All of our research
      was confirmed by that admission.<b><br>

      of&nbsp; the Treasury known&nbsp; as the&nbsp; "Internal Revenue
      Service" or the "Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms."&nbsp;
      Title 31 U.S.C. is "Money and Finance" and&nbsp; therein are&nbsp;
      published the&nbsp; laws pertaining&nbsp; to the Department
      of&nbsp; the Treasury ("DOT").&nbsp; Title 31 U.S.C., Chapter 3,
      is a&nbsp; statutory list&nbsp; of the&nbsp; organizations of the
      DOT.&nbsp; Internal Revenue Service&nbsp; and/or Bureau&nbsp; of
      Alcohol,&nbsp; Tobacco and Firearms are&nbsp; not&nbsp;&nbsp;
      listed&nbsp; within&nbsp;&nbsp; Title&nbsp; 31&nbsp;&nbsp;
      U.S.C.&nbsp; as&nbsp;&nbsp; agencies&nbsp; or organizations
      of&nbsp; the Department&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp;
      Treasury.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They&nbsp; are referenced, however, as
      "to be audited" by the Controller General in 31 U.S.C. Section

      Remember&nbsp; that "Internal Revenue"&nbsp; is the name of the
      Puerto Rico Trust #62.&nbsp; It is perfectly logical and

      <div align="center"><big><b>Graphene device puts fuel-efficient
            cars in pole position</b><br>
        </big></div>
      <br>
      A graphene-based electrical nano-device has been created which
      could substantially increase the energy efficiency of fossil
      fuel-powered cars.<br>
      <br>
      The nano-device, known as a 'ballistic rectifier', is able to
      convert heat which would otherwise be wasted from the car exhaust
      and engine body into a useable electrical current.<br>
      <br>
      Parts of car exhausts can reach temperatures of 600 degrees
      Celsius. The recovered energy can then be used to power additional
      automotive features such as air conditioning and power steering,
      or be stored in the car battery.<br>
      <br>
      The nano-rectifier was built by a team at The University of
      Manchester led by Professor Aimin Song and Dr. Ernie Hill, with a
      team at Shandong University. The device utilises graphene's
      phenomenally high electron mobility, a property which determines
      how fast an electron can travel in a material and how fast
      electronic devices can operate.<br>
      <br>
      The resulting device is the most sensitive room-temperature
      rectifier ever made. Conventional devices with similar conversion
      efficiencies require cryogenically low temperatures.<br>
      <br>
      Even today's most efficient internal combustion engines can only
      convert about 70% of energy burned from fossil fuels into the
      energy required to power a car. The rest of the energy created is
      often wasted through exhaust heat or cooling systems.<br>
      <br>
      Greg Auton, who performed most of the experiment said: "Graphene
      has exceptional properties; it possesses the longest carrier mean
      free path of any electronic material at room temperature.<br>
      <br>
      "Despite this, even the most promising applications to
      commercialise graphene in the electronics industry do not take
      advantage of this property. Instead they often try to tackle the
      the problem that graphene has no band gap."<br>
      <br>
      Professor Song who invented the concept of the ballistic rectifier
      said: "The working principle of the ballistic rectifier means that
      it does not require any band gap. Meanwhile, it has a
      single-layered planar device structure which is perfect to take
      the advantage of the high electron-mobility to achieve an
      extremely high operating speed.<br>
      <br>
      "Unlike conventional rectifiers or diodes, the ballistic rectifier
      does not have any threshold voltage either, making it perfect for
      energy harvest as well as microwave and infrared detection".<br>
      <br>
      Graphene was the world's first two-dimensional material, isolated
      in 2004 at The University of Manchester, since then a whole family
      of other 2D materials have been discovered.<br>
      <br>
      The advantage of a graphene-based nano-rectifier is its high
      conversion efficiency from an alternating current to a direct
      current at room temperature, enabled by the extremely high
      electron mobility achieved in this work.<br>
      <br>
      The Manchester-based group is now looking to scale up the research
      by using large wafer-sized graphene and perform high-frequency
      experiments. The resulting technology can also be applied to
      harvesting wasted heat energy in power plants.<br>

      Oooooklahoma! Where the cops can stop and empty your bank cards –
      on just a hunch... Civil asset forfeiture goes digital and

      <br>
      Police in Oklahoma are deploying an electronic scanner that can
      drain currency from prepaid credit cards seized at the roadside
      using civil asset forfeiture laws.<br>
      <br>
      The reader can record data from any magstripe card – even down to
      hotel keys – and works with Visa, MasterCard, and American
      Express, as well as Best Buy, Costco, Macy's and Walmart gift
      cards. Any funds found can be frozen or transferred directly to a
      law enforcement bank account "to protect the integrity of the
      evidence and ensure the funds are available for trial or
      forfeiture," ERAD's advertising states.<br>
      <br>
      The state police are paying ERAD $5,000 and 7.7 per cent of all
      funds seized. Highway Patrol Lt John Vincent told KWTV that the
      main purpose of the readers is to catch identity thieves and money
      launderers.<br>
      <br>
      "We're gonna look for different factors in the way that you're
      acting," he said. "We're gonna look for if there's a difference in
      your story; if there's some way that we can prove that you're
      falsifying information to us about your business. I know that a
      lot of people are just going to focus on the seizing money. That's
      a very small thing that's happening now."<br>
      <br>
      If the highway patrolman has even a suspicion that something fishy
      is going on, they have the legal right to seize any cash or goods
      that they think were used in a crime. The deployment of the ERAD
      system now opens up digital funds to the police, meaning money can
      be immediately taken electronically on the spot, thanks to civil
      asset forfeiture laws.<br>
      <br>
      Other state governments are also waking up to this issue. In
      April, Maryland became the ninth US state to enact laws ending the
      practice, and 11 more have bills in progress to block asset
      forfeiture until a conviction has been obtained.<br>
      <br>
      In the meantime, ERAD is trying to sell its reader to more local
      and state police. So if you see flashing blue lights in the rear
      view mirror, expect to be asked for your license, registration,
      and wallet. <br>

      <div align="center"><big><b>Copper is key in burning fat:
            Scientist says results could provide new target for obesity
            research</b><br>
        </big></div>
      <br>
      A new study is further burnishing copper's reputation as an
      essential nutrient for human physiology. A research team led by a
      scientist at the Department of Energy's Lawrence Berkeley National
      Laboratory (Berkeley Lab) and at the University of California,
      Berkeley, has found that copper plays a key role in metabolizing
      fat.<br>
      <br>
      Long prized as a malleable, conductive metal used in cookware,
      electronics, jewelry and plumbing, copper has been gaining
      increasing attention over the past decade for its role in certain
      biological functions. It has been known that copper is needed to
      form red blood cells, absorb iron, develop connective tissue and
      support the immune system.<br>
      <br>
      The new findings, to appear in the July print issue of Nature
      Chemical Biology but published online today, establishes for the
      first time copper's role in fat metabolism.<br>
      <br>
      The team of researchers was led by Chris Chang, a faculty
      scientist at Berkeley Lab's Chemical Sciences Division, a UC
      Berkeley professor of chemistry and a Howard Hughes Medical
      Institute investigator. Co-lead authors of the study are Lakshmi
      Krishnamoorthy and Joseph Cotruvo Jr, both UC Berkeley
      postdoctoral researchers in chemistry with affiliations at
      Berkeley Lab.<br>
      <br>
      "We find that copper is essential for breaking down fat cells so
      that they can be used for energy," said Chang. "It acts as a
      regulator. The more copper there is, the more the fat is broken
      down. We think it would be worthwhile to study whether a
      deficiency in this nutrient could be linked to obesity and
      obesity-related diseases."<br>
      <br>
      <b>Dietary copper</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Chang said that copper could potentially play a role in restoring
      a natural way to burn fat. The nutrient is plentiful in foods such
      as oysters and other shellfish, leafy greens, mushrooms, seeds,
      nuts and beans.<br>
      <br>
      According to the Food and Nutrition Board of the Institute of
      Medicine, an adult's estimated average dietary requirement for
      copper is about 700 micrograms per day. The Food and Nutrition
      Board also found that only 25 percent of the U.S. population gets
      enough copper daily.<br>
      <br>
      "Copper is not something the body can make, so we need to get it
      through our diet," said Chang. "The typical American diet,
      however, doesn't include many green leafy vegetables. Asian diets,
      for example, have more foods rich in copper."<br>
      <br>
      But Chang cautions against ingesting copper supplements as a
      result of these study results. Too much copper can lead to
      imbalances with other essential minerals, including zinc.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Copper as a 'brake on a brake'</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The researchers made the copper-fat link using mice with a genetic
      mutation that causes the accumulation of copper in the liver.
      Notably, these mice have larger than average deposits of fat
      compared with normal mice.<br>
      <br>
      The inherited condition, known as Wilson's disease, also occurs in
      humans and is potentially fatal if left untreated.<br>
      <br>
      Analysis of the mice with Wilson's disease revealed that the
      abnormal buildup of copper was accompanied by lower than normal
      lipid levels in the liver compared with control groups of mice.
      The researchers also found that the white adipose tissue, or white
      fat, of the mice with Wilson's disease had lower levels of copper
      compared with the control mice and correspondingly higher levels
      of fat deposits.<br>
      <br>
      They then treated the Wilson's disease mice with isoproterenol, a
      beta agonist known to induce lipolysis, the breakdown of fat into
      fatty acids, through the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)
      signaling pathway. They noted that the mice with Wilson's disease
      exhibited less fat-breakdown activity compared with control mice.<br>
      <br>
      The results prompted the researchers to conduct cell culture
      analyses to clarify the mechanism by which copper influences
      lipolysis. The researchers used inductively coupled plasma mass
      spectroscopy (ICP-MS) equipment at Berkeley Lab to measure levels
      of copper in fat tissue.<br>
      <br>
      They found that copper binds to phosphodiesterase 3, or PDE3, an
      enzyme that binds to cAMP, halting cAMP's ability to facilitate
      the breakdown of fat.<br>
      <br>
      "When copper binds phosphodiesterase, it's like a brake on a
      brake," said Chang. "That's why copper has a positive correlation
      with lipolysis."<br>
      <br>
      <b>Hints from cows</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The connection between copper and fat metabolism is not altogether
      surprising. The researchers actually found hints of the link in
      the field of animal husbandry.<br>
      <br>
      "It had been noted in cattle that levels of copper in the feed
      would affect how fatty the meat was," said Chang. "This effect on
      fat deposits in animals was in the agricultural literature, but it
      hadn't been clear what the biochemical mechanisms were linking
      copper and fat."<br>
      <br>
      The new work builds upon prior research from Chang's lab on the
      roles of copper and other metals in neuroscience. In support of
      President Barack Obama's BRAIN Initiative, Berkeley Lab provided
      Chang seed funding in 2013 through the Laboratory Directed
      Research and Development program. Chang's work continued through
      the BRAIN Tri-Institutional Partnership, an alliance with Berkeley
      Lab, UC Berkeley and UC San Francisco.<br>
      <br>
      Of the copper in human bodies, there are particularly high
      concentrations found in the brain. Recent studies, including those
      led by Chang, have found that copper helps brain cells communicate
      with each other by acting as a brake when it is time for neural
      signals to stop.<br>
      <br>
      While Chang's initial focus was on the role of copper in neural
      communications, he branched out to investigations of metals in fat
      metabolism and other biological pathways. This latest work was
      primarily funded by the National Institutes of Health. <br>

      </b><b>Default Re: Copper is key in burning fat: Scientist says
        results could provide new target for obesity research</b><br>
      <br>
      …Copper is one of the co-factors for one form of an enzyme called
      superoxide dismutase (SOD). SOD is one of the major antioxidant
      enzymes in the body. As a measure of how important SOD is,
      amyotrophic lateral sclerosis—also known as Lou Gehrig's
      disease—is thought to be the result of an underfunctioning (SOD)
      enzyme…<br>
      <br>
      In more advanced cases of copper deficiency, including people who
      have undergone gastric bypass surgery, this loss of antioxidant
      protection over a period of years can lead to irreversible damage
      to the nervous system. However, this does not appear to occur
      without the types of unusual deficiency risks detailed below.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Bone and Tissue Integrity</b><br>
      <br>
      Copper is required to manufacture collagen, a major structural
      protein in the body. When copper deficiency becomes severe, tissue
      integrity—particularly bones and blood vessels—can begin to break
      down...<br>
      <br>
      At least one recent author has speculated that the marginal copper
      status of the diets of about one-quarter of adults in the U.S. is
      related to eventual development of osteoporosis in some members of
      this group….<br>
      <br>
      <b>Energy Support</b><br>
      <br>
      Copper plays two key roles in energy production. First, it helps
      with incorporation of iron into red blood cells, preventing
      anemia. Second, it is involved with generation of energy from
      carbohydrates inside of cells.<br>
      <br>
      Each of these uses of copper also requires iron, and for this
      reason, the symptoms of copper deficiency can mimic those of low
      iron intake. Lentils, and sesame seeds are just a few examples of
      World's Healthiest Foods rich in both iron and copper.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Cholesterol Balance</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Animal studies have demonstrated that copper-deficient diets lead
      to increases in blood cholesterol levels. In humans,… the effect
      of copper deficiency appears to be through increased activity of
      an enzyme called HMG-CoA reductase—the same enzyme targeted by the
      most commonly prescribed cholesterol medications.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Summary of Food Sources...</b><br>
      <br>
      Many of the excellent food sources of copper are leafy greens,
      including turnip greens, spinach, Swiss chard, kale, and mustard
      greens. Asparagus and summer squash are two other excellent
      vegetable sources of copper.<br>
      <br>
      The good and very good sources of copper include many legumes,
      whole grains, nuts, and seeds. For example, flax seeds, walnuts,
      and garbanzo beans are rated as very good sources of copper...<br>

            Future Collapse?</b><br>
        </big></div>
      <br>
      …John H. Koyle had visions of the future and he prophesied things
      to come. Not only did he prophesy, but what he said came true. It
      happened like he said…<br>
      <br>
      Here are some of his prophecies:<br>
      <br>
      "The economy will totally collapse on a holiday weekend where
      there is a holiday on a Monday. When this collapse happens, we
      will wake up with no electricity and possibly no utilities either.
      The economy will be propped up, as if on high stilts, and then
      overnight it will all come crashing down. <br>
      <br>
      "Russia will be on the borders of Turkey and they will bomb Turkey
      pretty badly. They will want possession of the Bosphorus and
      Dardanelle waterways.<br>
      <br>
      "There will be a 4 year famine, but it will take longer than 4
      years to recover from it. The first 2 years of this famine will be
      the years when wheat can still be collected. But, the next 2
      years, there will not be much food raised, especially in the 4th
      year... <br>
      <br>
      "A tidal wave will hit the coast of California and there will be a
      few earthquakes in Utah.<br>
      <br>
      "The dollar will become worthless. Koyle saw dollars on the ground
      and nobody bothered to pick them up…<br>
      <br>
      "Transportation will shut down and we will not be able to go to
      stores to buy food..<br>

      <i>Harvey Cheng Comments </i>-- Fontus is complete garbage, do
      the science. According to their own numbers it would take forever
      to even fill half the bottle, which is pointless in any survival
      situation. This only works decent if you were at 100% humidity
      24hrs/day, such ridiculousness. Pocket Shot could be a decent tool
      if the guys making it actually cared about their product. They
      never answer any questions about product specifications or
      availability and only reply when you leave a positive comment or
      if you've already ordered one. Extremely bad business practice and
      just alienates the entire customer base. Extremely long shipping
      times and I mean the time it takes for them to actually mail it
      after order is placed, not the travel time after it gets to
      carrier. For $25 you can get a wrist rocket type slingshot and a
      spring assisted folding knife instead, with better customer
      service too. As a matter of fact for around $35-40 you can get a
      crossbow pistol on Amazon, which is way stronger than this could
      ever be. Either get a wrist rocket or a crossbow pistol because
      this is priced in between, yet not better than either.﻿<br>

      TV: “Truly unsettling” discovery at Fukushima… problem “far
      greater than previously thought” — Boss reveals 600 tons of fuel
      melted, can’t find it — Top Official: “Nobody really knows where
      fuel is”… We may never be able to get it and just leave wherever —
      “Uncontrollable fission” is continuing under site (VIDEO)<br>
      <br>
      ABC Australia, May 24, 2016 (emphasis added): [ABC's Mark Willacy]
      has been invited on a tour of [Fukushima Daiichi]… What Willacy
      discovers is truly unsettling… retrieving hundreds of tonnes of
      melted nuclear fuel turns out to be far greater than previously
      thought.<br>
      <br>
      ABC Australia transcript excerpts, May 24, 2016:<br>
      <br>
      Willacy: Tonight we go on a journey into the heart of this ongoing
      crisis… and we reveal the frightening enormity of the clean-up…
      and how dangerous it still is.<br>
      <br>
      Gregory Jaczko, former Chairman of the US Nuclear Regulatory
      Commission: This really is unchartered territory. Nobody really
      knows where the fuel is… There’s no playbook – they’re making this
      up as they go along.<br>
      <br>
      Willacy: The man in charge of decontaminating and decommissioning
      the Fukushima plant, Naohiro Masuda. Has anything like this ever
      been attempted before?<br>
      <br>
      Masuda: There has never been an accident at a nuclear plant like
      the one at Fukushima where three reactors had meltdowns. We are
      currently working on a timetable to decommission the reactors over
      the next 30 to 40 years.<br>
      <br>
      Naoto Kan, Former Prime Minister: I think it will take longer…
      This is a major accident, which has never happened anywhere in the
      world… 40 years is an optimistic view.<br>

      <br>
      This YouTube video is a well-documented examination of the Earth's
      crust, but does not explain HOW this could happen.<br>
      <br>
      If this change in size were due to asteroids and celestial debris
      then...<br>
      - the whole surface would be new but get older as you dig<br>
      - the continents wouldn't fit together<br>
      - archeological sites would be buried, deeply<br>
      - rising ground levels and rocks falling from the sky would be a
      common concern.<br>
      <br>
      The Earth, and ALL spherical celestial bodies, are in fact HOLLOW
      with a very heavy core or inner sun at its center. Whenever a
      volcano erupts, a fault line shifts, or a continent moves, the
      surface of the Earth gets a little bigger and this shell a very
      tiny bit thinner - like blowing up a balloon.<br>
      <br>
      Will it 'pop' or collapse? After 8 billion years, I doubt it.<br>
      <br>
      WHY HOLLOW PLANETS?<br>
      Every planet starts with a central, high-density mass which
      catches loose matter into orbit. This matter ultimately becomes a
      shell with openings on the rotational axis.<br>
      <br>
      "I thought the Earth was a molten mass which cooled."<br>
      reply: THERE IS NO BEDROCK!<br>
      <br>
      Ask ANY miner, driller, or foundation specialist. 1,000 feet,
      5,000 feet, 10,000 feet deep in Denver, Colorado at the foot of
      the Rocky Mountains there is NO BEDROCK. The mountains are made of
      rock. There you will have bedrock. But if the whole Earth were
      once a molten mass, there would be bedrock EVERYWHERE!<br>
      <br>
      Did you know that the entire Arctic and Antarctic zones are UNITED
      STATES military 'no fly zones'. Why?<br>
      <br>
      Examples of polar openings are seen easily in satellite
      photography of 'black holes'. These clearly show powerful
      emissions at the poles. [Black holes are NOT sigularities - they
      have measurable size.]<br>
      Good photos of comets show a bright little 'star' (the inner sun),
      a shell, and a tail standing perpendicular to the sun - always
      pointing away.<br>
      <br>
      PS. Every culture AND religion has a tradition of a place below
      the surface - Hell, Argatha, Heaven... but EVERYONE has a
      tradition of... Hollow Earth.<br>

      “The next Fourth Turning is due to begin shortly after the new
      millennium, midway through the Oh-Oh decade. Around the year 2005,
      a sudden spark will catalyze a Crisis mood. Remnants of the old
      social order will disintegrate. Political and economic trust will
      implode. Real hardship will beset the land, with severe distress
      that could involve questions of class, race, nation and empire.
      The very survival of the nation will feel at stake. Sometime
      before the year 2025, America will pass through a great gate in
      history, commensurate with the American Revolution, Civil War, and

      SESSION 7: SPECIAL SESSION: ELECTROSTATIC CONSIDERATIONS IN
      INDUSTRY<br>
      MODERATOR: D. Swenson, 3M<br>
      <br>
      7.7 CASE STUDY - LARGE PLASTIC WEB ELECTROSTATIC PROBLEMS,<br>
      RESULTS, AND CURE, D. Swenson, 3M Company<br>
      <br>
      Tremendous static charge generation on a plastic web causes unique
      physical phenomena and special problems. Solution was simple and
      cost effective.<br>
      <br>
      David Swenson of 3M Corporation describes an anomaly where workers
      encountered a strange "invisible wall" in the area under a
      fast-moving sheet of electrically charged polypropelene film in a
      factory. This "invisible wall" was strong enough to prevent humans
      from passing through. A person near this "wall" was unable to
      turn, and so had to walk backwards to retreat from it.<br>
      <br>
      This occurred in late summer in South Carolina, August 1980, in
      extremely high humidity. Polypropelene (PP) film on 50K ft. rolls
      20ft wide was being slit and transferred to multiple smaller
      spools. The film was taken off the main roll at high speed, flowed
      upwards 20ft to overhead rollers, passed horizontally 20ft and
      then downwards to the slitting device, where it was spooled onto
      shorter rolls. The whole operation formed a cubical shaped tent,
      with two walls and a ceiling approximately 20ft square. The spools
      ran at 1000ft/min, or about 10MPH. The PP film had been
      manufactured with dissimilar surface structure on opposing faces.
      Contact electrification can occur even in similar materials if the
      surface textures or micro-structures are significantly different.
      The generation of a large imbalance of electrical surface-charge
      during unspooling was therefore not unexpected, and is a common
      problem in this industry. "Static cling" in the megavolt range!<br>
      <br>
      On entering the factory floor and far from the equipment, Mr.
      Swenson's 200KV/ft handheld electrometer was found to slam to full
      scale. When he attempted to walk through the corridor formed by
      the moving film, he was stopped about half way through by an
      "invisible wall." He could lean all his weight forward but was
      unable to pass. He observed a fly get pulled into the charged,
      moving plastic, and speculates that the e-fields might have been
      strong enough to suck in birds!<br>
      <br>
      The production manager did not believe Mr. Swenson's report of the
      strange phenomena. When they both returned to the factory floor,
      they found that the "wall" was no longer there. But the production
      workers had noticed the effect as occurring early in the morning
      when humidity was lower, so they agreed to try again another day.
      The second attempt was successful, and early in the morning the
      field underneath the "tent" was strong enough to raise even the
      short, curly hair of the production manager. The "invisible wall"
      effect had returned. He commented that he "didn't know whether to
      fix it or sell tickets." <br>
      <br>
      Problems: coulomb forces would be expected to attract a person
      into the "chamber" formed by the PP film, and the attractive force
      should be fairly linear across distance. There should be no "wall"
      in the center, a "wall" is repulsive and nonlinear.<br>
      <br>
      If for some reason a person was repelled from the center of the
      chamber rather than being attracted, there still should be no
      "wall," since the repulsion force should exist over a large
      distance; it should act like a deep pillow which exerts more and
      more force as one moves deeper into it. It should not behave like
      a "wall". This is how magnets and iron behave, and this is how
      e-fields and conductive objects should also behave.<br>
      <br>
      A thought: unspooling of film typically generates higher net
      charge on the long piece of film than on the limited surface of
      the spool. However, since net charge is conserved, imbalances of
      charge must be equal and opposite. The charge on the entire length
      of moving film must be equal in magnitude to the charge on the
      spool, yet the charge on the film is very large and is
      continuously increasing. The limited surface-charge on the spool
      indicates that opposite charge is being lost through some unseen
      path. Very probably the spool is spewing out enormous quantities
      of ionized air with polarity opposite that of the charge on the
      moving plastic film.<br>
      <br>
      Charged air would arise in the cleft between film and spool as the
      film was peeled from the spool. I wonder if film was peeled from
      the top of the spool, so that any ionized air created in the cleft
      would be launched into the "tent-chamber" region? If it was peeled
      from the bottom of the spool, the charged air would end up outside
      the "tent." Or, if a corona discharge arises in the cleft between
      film and spool, perhaps the UV and e-fields of this corona can
      ionize the air on both sides of the exiting plastic film, and
      spray the charged air everywhere.<br>
      <br>
      So, if the charged "tent" of film is negative in the above
      situation, and if a large quantity of positively charged air is
      being generated at the spool, then perhaps the "invisible wall" is
      caused by a cloud of suspended air ions. Perhaps it is a pressure
      gradient created by ionized air trapped under the tent by
      electrostatic attraction. Yet this effect would be expected to
      create a diffuse zone of increasing force, not a "wall", but an
      "invisible pillow." Added note: concrete floors behave as
      conductors in this situation. Where megavolts at microamps are
      involved, the border between insulators and conductors is
      10^6/10^-6 = 10^12 ohms, or 1000 gigaohms. Concrete resistivity is
      more in the realm of megohms, so it behaves like a grounded metal
      sheet.<br>
      <br>
      However, a volume of charged air is somewhat analogous to iron
      filings near a magnet. If a solid sheet of iron filings is held in
      place by a magnet, then a literal "wall" is created, and this wall
      will resist penetration by nonferrous objects. If in the above
      manufacturing plant a sheet of highly charged air is for some
      reason being held in place by the fields created by the charged
      film, then a transparent "wall" made of charged air would come
      into being. It might resist penetration by human bodies.<br>
      <br>
      My question is this: if the entire situation could be turned on
      its side, so the "invisible wall" became an "invisible floor",
      could a person *stand* on it? Have we discovered the long-sought
      "Zero-G waterbed?" :) - B.B. <br>

            Peter Thompson Response from Melissa Georgiou</b><br>
        </big></div>
      <br>
      Paraphrased and dramatized by Cynthia Waters<br>
      <br>
      In August of 1980 in the southeast United States, problems were
      being experienced at a polypropylene plant. Strange things were
      happening around a film slitting machine.<br>
      <br>
      David Swenson of 3M Electrical Specialties Division in Austin,
      Texas was called in to investigate. Little did he know that he was
      about to enter the final frontier. When Dave asked what type of
      problem they wanted him to look at, he was told that he would have
      to come to the plant. They could not explain it over the
      telephone. They did tell him that they were experiencing problems
      with contamination of wide web film as it was being run at high
      speed, converted (split) into "film jumbos" with a width of 3' x
      5' for coating with adhesive to make tape. Dave didn't see what
      was so unusual about film being contaminated by dust, flies, other
      insects and... birds. "Birds"?<br>
      <br>
      Now they had Dave's attention and he didn't hesitate to go to the
      plant to see for himself how birds could be caught up in film.<br>
      <br>
      The Polypropylene web was 21 feet across - almost the width of
      three lanes of traffic on the interstate.&nbsp; The film ran from
      one roller up 20 feet to another roller; across 15 feet to a third
      roller; down 20 feet to a splitter; and was then wound onto two
      rolls. It formed a huge dynamic "tent". On the morning that Dave
      intended to measure the static electricity inside the web tent ,
      the temperature was 80°F with a relative humidity of 75 to 80%.<br>
      <br>
      As he walked toward the web with his field meter in hand, the
      machine operator said "I wouldn't do that if I were you. Strange
      things happen inside the web tent this time of day."<br>
      <br>
      Dave paused and thought about what the man had said but he was
      there to do a job and that was what he intended to do. You see,
      Dave is a very brave guy. Besides, it was just film running on a
      splitting machine. He had seen that many times and nothing seemed
      particularly unusual that morning. That is, until he looked down
      at his static field meter.<br>
      <br>
      With a 200kV @ 12" measurement device, the voltage measurements
      were off the scale and he was still 20 feet away from the web! For
      the meter to be pegged at that distance, the amount of static
      electricity had to be in the Megavolt range. He thought to himself
      "Van de Graaff would be proud!"<br>
      <br>
      Since he had come this far, Dave decided to enter the web anyway.
      As he did so, the hair on his head, arms and entire body began to
      stand on end. Even worse, he began to feel like sparklers were
      hitting him all over his body. It felt like burning sensations at
      hundreds of points all over his being. (brave? - hummm?) At
      exactly one-half way into the web, David slammed into a wall that
      was both invisible and impenetrable. It felt like he had hit a
      force field like he had seen on Star Trek.<br>
      <br>
      Although he knew this was Coulomb's Forces - the law of static
      attraction and repulsion - he was held in place for what seemed
      like ages as he tried to grasp what was actually happening to him.
      It's one thing to know about Coulomb forces, but it is quite
      another to feel them with such gusto. When he finally came to his
      senses, he had to literally "peel" himself off of the invisible
      wall.<br>
      <br>
      As he backed out of the web, he saw a fly drawn right up into the
      film and wondered if conditions ever existed inside that web that
      could actually draw a person up there as well. Dave hurried to
      talk with the Plant Manager and excitedly explained what had just
      happened to him. The Plant Manager agreed to go to the web to see
      for himself what was going on. By the time he was able to go,
      however, it was later in the day and the temperature and relative
      humidity had risen. He was able to walk into the web and from one
      side to the other without experiencing anything at all unusual. He
      told Dave that he thought he was simply hallucinating. When the
      machine operator corroborated Dave's story, the Plant Manager
      agreed to meet early the next morning to see if the same
      conditions would exist as they had experienced earlier in the day.
      They met bright and early the next day. As the Plant Manager
      entered the web, his curly gray hair immediately straightened. As
      he strutted toward the center of the web, his confident gait
      suddenly came to a complete stop as he hit the wall of
      invisibility.<br>
      <br>
      Once he peeled himself off of the force field wall, a shaken Plant
      Manager came out of the web and exclaimed...<br>
      <br>
      that he "didn't know whether they should fix it or sell tickets".<br>
      <br>
      They decided to fix it.<br>
      <br>
      Conclusion Static Electricity can cause some very strange and
      often difficult to explain phenomena. It is easily controlled if a
      commitment is made. This nuisance can be reduced to a non-nuisance
      level by proper analysis and installation of suitable equipment,
      at a very low cost.<br>
      <br>
      Corrective Action An induction static eliminator was installed
      across the web at the unwind. The static electricity was
      immediately reduced throughout the process to less than 50kV (from
      MV's). It was then possible to make measurements in the rest of
      the area. Additional induction units were also installed at the
      jumbo wind-up areas which resulted in less than 5kV at conclusion.

      far have stayed above the law, all but poor Sterling Allan.<br>
      <br>
      His friends, his partners, his “crew” run free while he waits for
      sentencing, as you will read below. They have threatened those who
      could bring them down with acid attacks (they jokingly call it
      “pie throwing”).<br>
      <br>
      <b>Recent Background</b><br>
      <br>
      Last fall, during a series of troll attacks on Iranian physicist
      Mehran T. Keshe, one of the “leadership council” of a group of
      what many call “free energy fraudsters” began posting admissions
      of child sex crimes.<br>
      <br>
      When Keshe came to me for advice, VT was doing an investigative
      study of his technology and foundations, I arranged for the FBI
      office in Rome to meet with him. Keshe had accumulated evidence
      and was, quite frankly, shocked that the leader of this group, one
      Keshe claimed he had met while in Belgium, a group according to
      him, of international child traffickers and gangsters, had not
      been arrested.<br>
      <br>
      Toward that end, the article below, taken from an anonymous
      website, limited in scope, strangely limited as we will get into,
      outlines the current legal case, as it is.<br>
      Anyway, back to the story. Back in 2005, Keshe had been approached
      to come to Belgium by a group including the Belgian royal family
      and those around them, a group Keshe later learned the truth
      about. This group, tied to a Freemason “police gang” VT believes
      is tied to terror attacks in France, trades in intellectual
      properties, patents, copyrights, trademark fraud, using blackmail,
      extortion and terrorism, tried to murder Keshe and his wife,
      Carolyn, who fled to Italy.<br>
      <br>
      His pursuers also run a major internet based worldwide child sex
      ring, Sterling Allan was their webmaster and the big story of this
      year was VT’s ability to tie the arrest of Allan, whose plea deal
      is outlined below, to his relationship furnishing children to a
      child sex/torture ring tied to a bizarre group, the “St. Hubertus”
      sect of the Bohemian Grove satanic worshipers.<br>
      <br>
      These guys run much of the US and most have dual membership with
      the National Prayer Breakfast, which is run by VT folks, not a
      pleasant discovery for us, I can tell you.<br>
      <br>
      It was Keshe’s information given to the FBI in Italy that led to
      the seizure of Sterling Allan’s computer back in January of 2016,
      which led to the Obama White House getting files tying Justice
      “Tony” Scalia to a child sex ring and demonstrating that it was
      Scalia that had protected Allan. With Justice Scalia exposed to
      Obama blackmail, his own friends smothered him to death with a
      pillow, and walked past police, while the world moved on, no
      autopsy, no investigation.<br>
      <br>
      During the time period covered by the court documents below,
      particularly 2007 to 2009, Sterling Allan was in and out of
      Belgium, meeting with the group that was holding Keshe and his
      wife, who had been suckered into a “too good to be true” deal.
      This group, which we have since found has gone after the European
      Space Agency and CERN group as well, filed dozens of patents for
      Keshe technology and was allowed to file for Keshe trademarks
      supported by Belgian courts.<br>
      <br>
      It is Belgium that is the hub of world human trafficking with the
      Netherlands running a close second. “Aid societies” in Morocco
      channel refugees to Spain where they were once smuggled into
      France and north to Belgium, until the French closed that border.<br>
      <br>
      Sterling Allan was hired and brought to Belgium to organize
      internet based “phishing” sites for child sex traffickers. There
      he met with Dirk Laureyssens, the “commercial artist” that the
      Belgians introduced Keshe to when he came to Belgium, whose only
      full time job today, as far as we know, is to “troll” Keshe. As to
      why Allan, the child sex trafficker, met with Laureyssens over and
      over in Belgium, we just don’t know, do we?<br>
      <br>
      Now they use fishing trawlers who offload their human cargoes at
      ports in Brittany, where they are run across the open borders to
      waiting police escorts to the sorting centers in Belgium and the
      Netherlands. These are the people Keshe crossed, a gang that
      crosses oceans, a gang that runs banks, a gang that uses even
      NATO’s private airport in Brussels to move drugs and kids, under
      the cover of more acceptable rendition and torture.<br>
      <br>
      This is a hard article to write. The extent of Sterling D. Allan’s
      depravity is worse than we thought. Sterling D. Allan pleaded
      guilty to two felonies for molesting underage girls, in a plea
      agreement. Sentencing will take place on 6/17/16. But just in case
      there is anyone out there who is still supporting the scumbag
      Sterling Allan and/or any of his fraudulent free energy scams he
      covered on his various websites we want to provide complete
      coverage of this case so those people will step away and distance
      themselves, not only from Allan but also from all of those false
      claims of working free energy devices.<br>
      <br>
      Sterling D. Allan was the greatest promoter, a past partner (we
      say past partner now, because Allan will be in jail for a long
      time), and most prolific writer covering the fraudulent e-cat
      scheme of Andrea Rossi. If it had not been for the extensive and
      positive coverage of Andrea Rossi’s fraudulent e-cat scheme by
      Sterling D. Allan and Mats Lewan, we think Rossi’s e-cat project
      would never have gotten off the ground.<br>
      <br>
      Andrea Rossi and all of his promoters and followers might want to
      take note. There is much talk on the blogs that Rossi is crazy,
      some even say that could be a defense if he was ever arrested. We
      don’t believe that at all, not in the least, never have. If Allan,
      who was a real nutcase, was found to sane enough to stand trial,
      what chance would Rossi have to get off on any type of claim like
      that?<br>
      <br>
      Allan claimed he came to this Earth to be a pedophile and that he
      was “god in the flesh.” Allan was first connected to underage
      girls when he disclosed that he almost kidnapped an underage girl,
      during the coverage of the Elizabeth Smart case. Most people in
      Utah have heard about her bizarre kidnapping and sexual assault at
      the hands of two fundamentalist religious zealots. Allan was
      disposed in the Brian David Mitchell trial, (for kidnapping and
      rape of a underage girl, Elizabeth Smart) because Mitchell was a
      member of one of Allan’s religious groups.<br>

      We have been following Allan’s legal story here in these articles

      In response to a question about what happened at Sterling D.
      Allan’s 5/9/2016 hearing, the court clerk sent this message –<br>
      <br>
      “On 5/9/16 the defendant was found competent to proceed and a plea
      agreement was reached.&nbsp; The defendant entered pleas to the
      amended charges. Sentencing is set for 6/17/16 at 9:30am.”<br>

      want the world to know the full extent of Sterling D. Allan’s
      depravity, not just the final charges he pleaded guilty to in the
      plea bargain. You will notice that the charges are that Allan was
      molesting his own daughters.<br>

      A new study suggests black holes are a holographic trick the

      &nbsp;<br>
      Is a black hole really just sound and fury, signifying nothing? If
      the new theory suggesting that these gravitational irregularities
      are actually just holograms proves correct than, yes, that would
      be a fair description. But the authors of the new paper in
      Physical Review Letters putting the argument forth have a long way
      to go to prove their case. It all has to do with the way we

      <br>
      For some context: The notion that a black hole is actually a
      holographic facade goes back to the 1990s, when Stanford

      <b>Abstract</b><br>
      <br>
      We construct condensate states encoding the continuum spherically
      symmetric quantum geometry of a horizon in full quantum gravity,
      i.e., without any classical symmetry reduction, in the group field
      theory formalism. Tracing over the bulk degrees of freedom, we
      show how the resulting reduced density matrix manifestly exhibits
      a holographic behavior. We derive a complete orthonormal basis of
      eigenstates for the reduced density matrix of the horizon and use
      it to compute the horizon entanglement entropy. By imposing
      consistency with the horizon boundary conditions and semiclassical
      thermodynamical properties, we recover the Bekenstein-Hawking
      entropy formula for any value of the Immirzi parameter. Our
      analysis supports the equivalence between the von Neumann
      (entanglement) entropy interpretation and the Boltzmann
      (statistical) one.<br>

      <div align="center"><big><b>Swiss Idealist to Sputnik: How My
            ‘Free Money For All’ Scheme Really Works</b></big><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      The Swiss are having a national vote on a revolutionary Marxist-
      inspired law that will give everybody unconditional basic income;
      one of the authors of the project told Radio Sputnik why everybody
      needs the money.<br>
      <br>
      On Sunday Switzerland will hold a nationwide referendum on a
      proposal to provide the entire population with an unconditional
      basic income – in other words – money for nothing.<br>
      <br>
      The Marx-inspired idea proposes a basic monthly income of 2,500
      Swiss francs ($2,652) for adults, and 625 Swiss francs for
      children. Its supporters say the state handouts would free people
      up to do important work that is currently not incentivized by
      markets, and help to fight poverty and inequality.<br>
      <br>
      "In the capitalist world there is freedom, but no basis equality
      and not enough society. This (referendum) is an offer to everybody
      to think about this unconditional basic income. First, to be
      precise, it's just a basic income, not your whole income."<br>
      <br>
      "There will be rich and poor, as today, there will be wages
      related to your performance as today, but the basic level will be
      protected for everyone," he explained.<br>
      <br>
      Schmidt believes such a system will reveal to individuals their
      intrinsic motivation for work, instead of just working for money.
      He also thinks it would change social structures.<br>
      <br>
      "It says that we trust everybody in society to decide for the
      best, that we are one society."<br>
      <br>
      "When you have that, you can imagine what will happen – wages will
      be renegotiated, social benefits will increase above this amount.
      It's not a huge mass of more money, it's about the fact it is
      unconditional and I think this is a step forward particularly in
      our consciousness, and (forces us to) rethink our values," Schmidt
      said. <br>
      <br>
      Schmidt said that the referendum was triggered after his campaign
      managed to get 100,000 signatures of support, and its result of
      which will be legally binding.<br>
      <br>
      The proposal could take up to 20 years to fully implement, he
      said.<br>
      <br>
      "If a majority (of voters) say yes, then the government will start
      with pilot projects, in regions, in some cantons. Then step by
      step we have to look at what is the right level for an
      unconditional basic income – 2,500 francs is just a number, it's
      enough for an adult to live but at a very low level."<br>
      <br>
      "So the population will decide again how much it should be, and
      how to finance it. It's a long process," he said. <br>

      <br>
      Almost 77 percent of the Swiss voters reject the $2,500 monthly
      Universal Basic Income (UBI) proposal in a national referendum on

      Switzerland May Guarantee All Citizens $2,600 Monthly Income<br>
      <br>
      GENEVA (Sputnik) — The failed revolutionary proposal called for
      all Swiss adults to be paid an unconditional monthly income,
      regardless of whether they worked or not. According to the authors
      of the initiative, which was proposed in early 2016, the UBI
      reflected the high cost of living in Switzerland. Meanwhile,
      opponents of the idea, including those from the government,
      believe that this innovation would weaken the country's economy...<br>
      <br>
      In January, a Demoscope poll revealed that 56 percent of the Swiss
      believed that the initiative would be rejected. Then, the majority
      of the Swiss population said they were unlikely to quit their jobs
      even if the initiative was supported.<br>

      An Ultra-Orthodox Israeli rabbi has introduced a new decree in one
      of Jerusalem’s neighborhoods that forbids all girls over the age
      of five from riding bicycles, claiming the activity is
      “provocative” and could “cause serious damage to their modesty.” …<br>

      ...New research by the University of Stirling in Scotland found
      that reservoir islands, the land masses created after a
      hydroelectric dam is constructed and the area is flooded, which
      were previously thought to be conservation sanctuaries, are
      causing huge drop-offs in flora and fauna. In some cases, almost
      90 percent of a certain species were lost…<br>
      <br>
      “We found a devastating reduction in species over time in the
      majority of reservoir islands we studied. On average, islands have
      35 percent fewer species than nearby mainland sites, however one
      South American bird community suffered as much as 87 percent loss
      of species on reservoir islands,” said Isabel Jones, the lead
      author of the study, in a statement. “We know flooding reservoirs
      causes immediate loss of habitat and species, but we now find
      there is also a significant future biological cost as the
      ‘extinction debt’ is paid.”…<br>

        <i>Cutaneous leishmaniasis, a disease transmitted through sand
          flies causes horrible open sores as well as disfiguring skin
          lesions</i><i><br>
        </i><br>
        <b>By Alexandra Sims</b><br>

      <br>
      A disfiguring tropical disease is sweeping across the Middle East
      as a combination of heavy conflict and a breakdown of health care
      facilities in Isis-occupied areas leaves swathes of people
      vulnerable to the illness.<br>
      <br>
      Cutaneous leishmaniasis is transmitted exclusively through bites
      from sand flies and can result in horrible open sores as well as
      disfiguring skin lesions, nodules or papules if left untreated.<br>
      <br>
      Leishmaniasis has been endemic in Syria for centuries and was once
      commonly known as the “Aleppo evil”. Until 1960, the disease's
      prevalence in Syria was restricted to two areas - Aleppo and
      Damascus. However, as Syria’s civil war continues the resulting
      refugee crisis has triggered a catastrophic outbreak of the
      disease, with the regions most affected under Isis control.<br>
      <br>
      Syria’s healthcare system has been devastated by years of
      conflict. In 2015 it was reported that more than half of the
      public hospitals in the country ­ previously a regional leader in
      healthcare ­ were closed or only partially functioning, leaving
      some patients forced to travel up to 100 miles to the nearest
      hospital.<br>
      <br>
      While the disease is treatable, Syria's present condition has seen
      the number of leishmaniasis cases reported to the Ministry of
      Health double from 23,000 before the start of the civil war in
      2011 to 41,000 in 2013, according to the PLOS research.<br>
      <br>
      Neighbouring countries, which have received millions of refugees
      are also reporting many leishmaniasis cases. In Lebanon, cases
      rose to 1,033 in 2013 from six in the previous 12 years. Hundreds
      of cases have also been reported in Turkey and Jordan.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Turkey's two million Syrian refugees</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      According to scientists, eastern Libya has also reported
      increasing numbers of leishmaniasis. In Yemen, an estimated 10,000
      new cases are reported every year. With Yeminis migrating to Saudi
      Arabia, concerns have been raised the disease may spread further.<br>
      <br>
      Dr Waleed Al-Salem, Consultant at Saudi Ministry of Health and
      formerly of the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, has
      stressed that while cutaneous leishmaniasis cases are increasing
      there is no risk of the disease spreading to areas of Europe such
      as Britain or Germany.<br>
      <br>
      "Many areas in Syria and temporary refugee settlements are
      pre-disposed to cases due to factors such as rubbish accumulation,
      bad sanitation and poor housing. This coupled with abundant sand
      fly populations and wanting medical facilities has created an
      environment for the disease to thrive.<br>
      <br>
      "Countries where sand flies are not common and where living
      standards and medical facilities are far more proficient are not
      in danger of cutaneous leishmaniasis."<br>
      <br>
      Sand flies, not people, transmit the disease, which are found
      throughout the tropics and subtropics but are unable to survive in
      colder climates. Leishmaniasis is already endemic in parts of
      southern Europe including Spain, Italy and the south of France,
      but typically the disease will only manifest itself in people with
      weak immune systems and those in prosperous regions where people
      have nutrition and general good health and are at limited risk.<br>
      <br>
      Dr Salem told the Independent: “When people are bitten by sand
      flies - which are tiny and smaller than a mosquito - it can take
      anything between two to six months to have the infection.<br>
      <br>
      “Someone might have picked it up in Syria but then they may have
      fled into Lebanon or Turkey as they seek refuge.<br>
      <br>
      “Prior to the outbreak of war there was good control of diseases,
      parasites and sand flies but when the conflict started no one
      cared, conditions worsened and the health system broke down, which
      has created an ideal environment for disease outbreaks.”<br>
      <br>
      The researchers behind the report are calling on clinicians and
      medics in refugee-hosting countries to be suitably trained to
      diagnose cutaneous leishmaniasis, for developments in tracking the
      disease to identify those populations at high risk and for prompt
      diagnosis and treatment of new outbreaks.<br>
      <br>
      Cutaneous leishmaniasis is one of 17 tropical diseases categorized
      by WHO as “neglected”. The organization says greater awareness of
      the disease, better monitoring, training for clinicians and vector
      control could go some way to halting the epidemic.<br>

      <b>NY Times Science Journal ( 2013 )</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      We found that higher temperatures and extreme rainfall led to
      large increases in conflict: for each one standard deviation
      change in climate toward warmer temperatures or more extreme
      rainfall, the median effect was a 14 percent increase in conflict
      between groups, and a 4 percent increase in conflict between
      individuals.<br>

      <b><br>
      </b>This is part 1 out of three of the MK2 micro Tesla building
      series. I decided to give it a shot and see if I can improve the
      performance of the previous micro Tesla turbine. Big thanks to
      Tesla Tech https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNEP..., as without
      his valuable input, I wouldn't have thought this design, which
      seems efficient and capable of achieving high output numbers
      considering its size.<br>
      <br>
      Some interesting data: MK1 MK2<br>
      Rotor diameter: 20mm 25mm<br>

      <br>
      This is part 2 of the micro Tesla turbine mk2 building series. It
      took way longer than I was expecting, due to the fact that I had
      to rebuilt the rotor. I run into some issues while making it and
      the one you see on the video is practically the 4th rotor (and
      successful) and each one was taking roughly 4-5 days to make. The
      new rotor has 22 total discs (instead of 18 that the original
      had). The most important thing though (and the reason that I had
      to remake it) was the spacers between the discs that are held in
      the 4 supporting tubes, which are way small in diameter than the
      original ones (1.9mm vs 7mm) allowing more airflow between the
      discs and thus increasing the boundary layer effect.<br>

      <br>
      In my satirical novel Invasion of the Dumb Snatchers, Miles
      Bennell saves America from intelligence.<br>
      <br>
      Of course, the story isn’t just fictional. In real life, all kinds
      of people are trying to save America from intelligence.<br>
      <br>
      This country is facing some incredibly huge and challenging
      problems. It will require a lot of intelligence to solve them.<br>
      <br>
      And consider that many Americans consider Donald Trump to be the
      best candidate to lead this country through these challenging
      times. Consider that the other candidates are following his lead,
      and have turned the presidential election—especially for the
      Republican Party—into a contest of who can be the most stupid.S<br>
      <br>
      <b>The powers that be</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      It should be obvious that “the powers that be” don’t want a
      population of thinkers. In Aldous Huxley’s book Brave New World
      Revisited, he outlined the very brief history of an organization
      called the Institute for Propaganda Analysis. The institute was
      formed in 1937, as a result of Nazi propaganda. The idea was to
      teach students the critical thinking skills that would allow them
      to analyze and debunk the propaganda. The problem was that when
      the United States entered the war, the government didn’t want
      anybody questioning our propaganda.<br>
      <br>
      But even before that, there was a lot of resistance to the
      organization. Teachers didn’t want students who questioned what
      they were being taught. The military definitely didn’t want
      soldiers questioning their officers. The church didn’t want people
      questioning the authority of the church. And corporations didn’t
      want people questioning the claims of their advertising.<br>
      <br>
      Basically, those in power don’t want people under their power
      asking too many questions. It might threaten their power. Or more
      to the point, it might threaten the benefits that come with that
      power.<br>
      <br>
      It’s not just “the powers that be”<br>
      <br>
      Of course, “the powers that be” have reasons for us to be stupid.<br>
      <br>
      But what about the rest of us? Why are the presidential candidates
      with the most stupid answers being rewarded with the most votes?<br>
      <br>
      There’s more to it than the powerful oppressors fighting to keep
      us stupid. We—at least a significant portion of “we”—seem to
      prefer it.<br>
      <br>
      Why else would so many Americans actively oppose the teaching of
      critical thinking courses in schools?<br>
      <br>
      It’s important to note that not only “the powers that be” were
      opposed to the Institute of Propaganda Analysis. Parents were also
      concerned that children with critical thinking skills might
      threaten parental authority. Consider: What if children came home
      from school demanding that their parents justify the reasons for
      what they did?<br>
      <br>
      <b>It gets personal</b><br>
      <br>
      Thinking can be dangerous. It might lead us to radically question
      our lives—to radically question the ideas that we’ve based our
      lives on.<br>
      <br>
      Thinking can be dangerous “existentially.”<br>
      <br>
      But it can also be dangerous in more “tangible” ways. We might ask
      questions about our culture that our culture doesn’t want to
      answer. We might ask questions that get us in trouble with “the
      powers that be.”<br>
      <br>
      Also, thinking might cause us to admit we’re wrong.<br>
      <br>
      I recently read an interview with film director Adam McKay,
      recounting a hilarious conversation with somebody trying to argue
      that the United States has the best health care system in the
      world. Facts made absolutely no difference as the other person
      just came back with arguments that got increasingly stupid to the
      point of absurdity.<br>
      <br>
      I’ve been part of many similar conversations about things like the
      need to end our dependence on fossil fuels.<br>
      <br>
      It’s identical to what happens if you try to convince an alcoholic
      to admit they’re an alcoholic. And for a very good reason: In both
      cases, you’re trying to talk somebody out of an addiction.<br>
      <br>
      Similar arguments occur with a variety of topics. Such as the need
      to create a post-consumer economy that’s not dependent on eternal
      growth on a finite planet.<br>
      <br>
      But such proposals generally aren’t even acknowledged. And if they
      are, they’re shouted down. Why?<br>
      <br>
      <b>Protecting the Ego</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Stupidity is increasing. And I think the basic reason is that we
      need to resort to increasing stupidity to avoid fixing the results
      of prior stupidity. Or to put it another way, we need stupidity to
      stay in denial.<br>
      <br>
      The human race has done some really stupid, egotistical things.
      Such as steadily destroying the ability of the planet to support
      life. Such as creating an economic system dependent on that
      destruction to keep from collapsing. If we were smart, we’d go
      about changing these stupid things.<br>
      <br>
      But that would be a threat to the idea that we’re not the most
      important thing in the universe. And it would be a threat to the
      so-called “benefits” of acting on that idea. So we’re forced to
      defend our stupidity with increasingly stupid excuses and
      rationalizations.<br>
      <br>
      I really do believe that we’re in a race between intelligence and
      stupidity. And I’m not very optimistic about how intelligence is
      doing.<br>
      <br>
      What do we do about it?<br>
      <br>
      There’s the million-dollar question. How do we use intelligence
      against a force that resists intelligence? Or in other words: How
      do we fix stupid?<br>
      <br>
      I only have one very personal answer: Mockery.<br>

      Since my thing is humor and satire, I wanted to figure out how to
      represent this in a humorous and satirical way. The movie Invasion
      of the Body Snatchers has always been one of my favorites. The
      movie, which came out in 1956, inspired all kinds of theories
      about how the story was a metaphor for McCarthyism or post-war
      conformity.<br>
      <br>
      Since the story deals with universal fears, so it can be
      interpreted in a variety of ways. So when I hit on the idea of
      twisting the story to be about stupidity, it was a natural fit.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Is mockery enough?</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      There’s plenty of satire out there, political and otherwise. Of
      course, it’s all (or mostly) a case of “preaching to the
      converted.” The people most receptive to it are those who least
      need to hear it. And the people that most need to hear it are
      those who most resist it.<br>
      <br>
      But what else are you going to do? What good does a satirical
      novel do?<br>
      <br>
      Well, probably about as much good as a well-researched non-fiction
      book full of facts and logic.<br>
      <br>
      For both, the answer is: “Probably not much.” But as least it’s
      something.<br>

            Predictions of 12 Mysterious Men.</b><br>
        </big></div>
      <br>
      This video covers 12 men who made predictions about a time period
      from 2015-2016. These men come from diverse backgrounds,
      nationalities, and time periods, and yet, they all seem to arrive
      at the same time frame for the unfolding of prophetic events. Some
      of these men predicted the destruction of the Vatican, others
      predicted the beginning of the millennial kingdom, others
      predicted the coming of the Antichrist, some predicted the coming
      of the Messiah, and still others believed that the window of the
      church would close after a 2000 year ministry of the Holy Spirit.<br>
      <br>
      Without a doubt, 2016 was the year to watch among these scholars.
      Many of them appear to be influenced by the predictions of Isaac
      Newton, and they cited him in connection with 2016. These men held
      to a historicist interpretation of scripture, which meant that
      prophecy was gradually unfolding throughout history. Most
      believers now are futurists, meaning that they believe prophecy
      will be accomplished in a short span of time set in the future.
      Despite this, it is unusual that so many theologians across
      several centuries seemed to agree with each other on the time
      frame, and that this pointed to 2015-2016 for the accomplishment
      of major biblical events.<br>

      This is a must read for all free Americans—but before you read
      this read these observations and see if you agree—<br>
      <br>
      1 – this explains a lot about Obama’s ineptness &amp; stupidity<br>
      <br>
      2 – Muslims are regressing to barbarism; their not to far past
      state .<br>
      <br>
      3 – Muslims here in the U.S. will be building there own version of
      a dysfunctional Detroit ‘give me’ state.<br>
      <br>
      This came to us from a Lockheed employee who has had 3 assignments
      to Saudi Arabia. Worth the read!<br>
      <br>
      During the pilot transition program with the KV-107 and C-130 with
      Lockheed, we found that most Saudi pilot trainees had very limited
      night vision, even on the brightest of moonlit nights. Their
      training retention rate was minimal including maintenance
      personnel.<br>
      <br>
      Some had dim memories and had to be constantly reminded of things
      that were told to them the day before. An American, British or any
      other western instructor is burned out pretty quick. It actually
      took Muslim C-130 pilots years before they could fly in the dark
      safely and then would be reluctant to leave the lights of a city.
      Ask any Marine, Air Force or Army guy who’s been trying to train
      Iraqis, and especially Afghans.<br>
      <br>
      Islam is not only a religion; it’s a way of life all the way
      around. Yet another set of revealing facts about Muslim beliefs
      and traditions and ways of life.<br>
      <br>
      1400 years of inbreeding.&nbsp; I found this to be interesting.
      Didn’t know whether to believe it or not. To research I went to
      Wikipedia, “Cousin Marriage”, and far down in the article
      “Genetics” it seems there is a lot of truth here.<br>
      <br>
      <b>A huge Muslim problem: Inbreeding</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Nikolai Sennels is a Danish psychologist who has done extensive
      research into a little-known problem in the Muslim world: the
      disastrous results of Muslim inbreeding brought about by the
      marriage of first cousins.<br>
      <br>
      This practice, which has been prohibited in the Judeo-Christian
      tradition since the days of Moses, was sanctioned by Muhammad and
      has been going on now for 50 generations (1,400 years) in the
      Muslim world. This practice of inbreeding will never go away in
      the Muslim world, since Muhammad is the ultimate example and
      authority on all matters, including marriage.<br>
      <br>
      The massive inbreeding in Muslim culture may well have done
      virtually irreversible damage to the Muslim gene pool, including
      extensive damage to its intelligence, sanity, and health.
      According to Sennels, close to half of all Muslims in the world
      are inbred. In Pakistan , the numbers approach 70%. Even in
      England , more than half of Pakistani immigrants are married to
      their first cousins, and in Denmark the number of inbred Pakistani
      immigrants is around 40%. The numbers are equally devastating in
      other important Muslim countries: 67% in Saudi Arabia , 64% in
      Jordan , and Kuwait , 63% in Sudan , 60% in Iraq , and 54% in the
      United Arab Emirates and Qatar .<br>
      <br>
      According to the BBC, this Pakistani, Muslim-inspired inbreeding
      is thought to explain the probability that a British Pakistani
      family is more than 13 times as likely to have children with
      recessive genetic disorders. While Pakistanis are responsible for
      three percent of the births in the UK, they account for 33% of
      children with genetic birth defects.<br>
      <br>
      The risks of what are called autosomal recessive disorders such as
      cystic fibrosis, spinal muscular atrophy is 18 times higher, and
      the risk of death due to malformations is 10 times higher. Other
      negative consequences of inbreeding include a 100 percent increase
      in the risk of stillbirths and a 50% increase in the possibility
      that a child will die during labor.<br>
      <br>
      Lowered intellectual capacity is another devastating consequence
      of Muslim marriage patterns. According to Sennels, research shows
      that children of consanguineous marriages lose 10-16 points off
      their IQ and that social abilities develop much slower in inbred
      babies. The risk of having an IQ lower than 70, the official
      demarcation for being classified as “retarded,” increases by an
      astonishing 400 percent among children of cousin marriages.
      (Similar effects were seen in the Paranoiac dynasties in ancient
      Egypt and in the British royal family, where inbreeding was the
      norm for a significant period of time.)<br>
      In Denmark , non-Western immigrants are more than 300 percent more
      likely to fail the intelligence test required for entrance into
      the Danish army. Sennels says, “The ability to enjoy and produce
      knowledge and abstract thinking is simply lower in the Islamic
      world.” He points out that the Arab world translates just 330
      books every year, about 20% of what Greece alone does.<br>
      <br>
      In the last 1,200 years of Islam, just 100,000 books have been
      translated into Arabic, about what Spain does in a single year.
      Seven out of 10 Turks have never even read a book. Sennels points
      out the difficulties this creates for Muslims seeking to succeed
      in the West. “A lower IQ, together with a religion that denounces
      critical thinking, surely makes it harder for many Muslims to have
      success in our high-tech knowledge societies.”<br>
      <br>
      Only nine Muslims have ever won the Nobel Prize, and five of those
      were for the “Peace Prize.” According to Nature magazine, Muslim
      countries produce just 10 percent of the world average when it
      comes to scientific research measured by articles per million
      inhabitants.<br>
      <br>
      In Denmark , Sennels’ native country, Muslim children are grossly
      over represented among children with special needs. One-third of
      the budget for Danish schools is consumed by special education,
      and anywhere from 51% to 70% of retarded children with physical
      handicaps in Copenhagen have an immigrant background. Learning
      ability is severely affected as well. Studies indicated that 64%
      of schoolchildren with Arabic parents are still illiterate after
      10 years in the Danish school system. The immigrant dropout rate
      in Danish high schools is twice that of the native-born.<br>
      <br>
      Mental illness is also a product. The closer the blood relative,
      the higher the risk of schizophrenic illness. The increased risk
      of insanity may explain why more than 40% of patients in Denmark
      ’s biggest ward for clinically insane criminals have an immigrant
      background. The U.S. is not immune. According to Sennels, “One
      study based on 300,000 Americans shows that the majority of
      Muslims in the USA have a lower income, are less educated, and
      have worse jobs than the population as a whole.”<br>
      <br>
      Sennels concludes: There is no doubt that the wide spread
      tradition of first cousin marriages among Muslims has harmed the
      gene pool among Muslims. Because Muslims’ religious beliefs
      prohibit marrying non-Muslims and thus prevents them from adding
      fresh genetic material to their population, the genetic damage
      done to their gene pool since their prophet allowed first cousin
      marriages 1,400 years ago are most likely massive. This has
      produced overwhelming direct and indirect human and societal
      consequences.<br>
      <br>
      Bottom line: Islam is not simply a benign and morally equivalent
      alternative to the Judeo-Christian tradition. As Sennels points
      out, the first and biggest victims of Islam are Muslims. Simple
      Judeo-Christian compassion for Muslims and a common-sense desire
      to protect Western civilization from the ravages of Islam dictate
      a vigorous opposition to the spread of this dark and dangerous
      religion. These stark realities must be taken into account when we
      establish public polices dealing with immigration from Muslim
      countries and the building of mosques in the U.S.<br>
      <br>
      Let us hope the civilized West and the North Americans wake up
      before a blind naiveté about the reality of Islam destroys what
      remains of our Judeo-Christian culture and our domestic
      tranquility.<br>

      Some call it paranoia, others call it anxiety. My own experience
      based opinion is it stems from one’s own compulsion to have to be
      in control. When it’s taken away suddenly with heightened
      awareness instead of alcohol’s lower awareness, one feels too
      vulnerable or exposed without his or her own socially protective
      behavioral patterns to fall back on.<br>
      <br>
      When singer songwriter Neil Young was being interviewed on air by
      radio shock jock broadcaster Howard Stern, an unusual biochemical
      solution to paranoia or other cannabis anxiety producing
      discomfort was brought up by Neil himself – black peppercorns.<br>
      <br>
      Stern had commented on why he no longer used pot. It made him
      paranoid. Neil suggested a solution of chewing on a couple of
      black peppercorns. Not so sure if I’d want to do that while
      feeling more awareness from cannabis. But then again, cannabis
      induced paranoia or anxiety has never been an issue for me.<br>
      <br>
      Here’s the scientific physiological biological chemical rationale
      behind the peppercorn solution. It has to do with complimentary
      terpenoid-THC entourage effects uncovered by a British
      pharmacological study titled “Taming THC: potential cannabis
      synergy and phytocannabinoid-terpenoid entourage effects”.<br>
      <br>
      Terpenes are compounds that give plants and flowers their
      individual aromas. Evidently, the terpenes from black peppercorns
      are what mellow out THC induced paranoia. The good folks at
      leafly.com who originally reported the Neil Young advice had
      success just smelling the black pepper….<br>

      <br>
      The British Journal of Pharmacology (link to article: BJP) has
      devoted another issue to the theme of cannabinoids. This issue
      contains numerous intriguing articles that you would be hard
      pressed to find discussed among media and science outlets.&nbsp;
      In a recent NPR Science Friday show on medical cannabis, Ira
      Flatow and guests suggested that there is a suppression of
      cannabis and cannabinoid research findings due to politics. This
      causes some journals to reject cannabinoid research without even
      reading the manuscript.&nbsp; Research journals are hesitant to
      publish research on cannabinoids, and many researchers often have
      to squander valuable funds re-submitting articles until they find
      a journal that will allow their research to be peer
      reviewed.&nbsp; The BJP deserves our attention for the great
      service it is doing for cannabinoid researchers—allowing our
      findings to be shared and discussed. One particular article in the
      BJP captured the imagination and wonder of cannabinoid science.
      The authors speculate on additional sources of plant cannabinoids,
      beyond the cannabis plant.<br>
      <br>
      It appears that other plants produce things that directly and
      indirectly affect the Endocannabinoid system (ECS). The ECS is a
      system in our body which produces compounds or ligands that
      activate specific receptors. This system regulates important
      functions of mammals. If you have ever slept, eaten, forgot, or
      relaxed then you have used your ECS.<br>
      <br>
      The receptors for cannabinoids are one of the most abundant
      receptors in the human brain and are expressed in nearly every
      tissue and cell. The two main receptors are the CB1 and CB2
      receptor. CB1 is located in the brain and on neurons throughout
      the body, while the CB2 is mostly found in the immune system.
      Given the abundance of these receptors, it’s not hard to imagine
      that these receptors are important for something.&nbsp;&nbsp;
      However, THC and other cannabis parts are not the only plant
      compounds which can affect the ECS. Other plants produce compounds
      which can change the production and breakdown of Anandamide.
      Anandamide activates the same receptor as THC and is one of many
      endogenous cannabinoids produced by our body.<br>
      <br>
      The recent discovery of different plants with compounds that can
      modulate this system means we can no longer simply define plant
      cannabinoids as merely a product of cannabis. The authors propose
      that the term phytocannabinoid is more appropriate now that
      scientists have discovered that Beta–Caryophyllene activates the
      CB2 receptor and is “among the most abundant plant essential oil
      component.” Beta–caryophyllene in found in nearly all plants, in
      fact it was proposed years ago that it is a “dietary cannabinoid.”<br>
      <br>
      So, what else have you been eating that mimics the effects of
      molecules from cannabis?<br>
      <br>
      Echinacea, Ruta graveolens (Citrus Family), and the Brassica genus
      (Mustard family, i.e. Broccoli) all contain compounds which may
      bind the CB2 receptor, some with an affinity or strength similar
      to THC. Note that unlike the CB1 receptor, the CB2 receptor does
      not cause psychotropic effects.<br>
      <br>
      Even the Apiaceae family contains a compound which interacts with
      the CB1 receptor. Why should you care about the Apiacea family?
      Carrots.<br>
      <br>
      Carrots and its relatives contain the compound falcarinol.&nbsp;
      This appears to interact with both cannabinoid receptors,
      undergoing a mysterious alkylation reaction at the CB1 receptor.
      The questions of how and what this compound is doing to the CB1
      receptor still needs to be investigated before we can draw any
      conclusions about the similarities between cannabis and carrots.<br>
      <br>
      Polyphenols are common components of tea and were speculated to
      interact with cannabinoid receptors. However, according to this
      article, Gertsch and collegues think that these may be
      non-specific interactions.&nbsp; The smelly molecular class of
      compounds known as terpenoids represents another potential group
      that can modulate the effects of cannabis and may affect the ECS.
      Terpenoids are abundant in vegetables and fruit.<br>
      <br>
      One misconception or urban legend regarding cannabis is the
      presence of cannabinoids in chocolate. Sorry to disappoint some of
      you but that infamous research has never been duplicated… However
      what is true about chocolate and cannabinoids is far more
      fascinating and beautifully complex.&nbsp; There are fatty acid
      derivatives in chocolate and many other plants which inhibit the
      FAAH enzyme. The FAAH enzyme destroys or eats Anandamide. The
      blocking of this FAAH enzyme leads to an increase or elevation of
      the levels of Anandamide. That’s right chocolate, like aspirin,
      elevates the so called “natural THC” in your body. No wonder
      chocolate is so popular. Halloween will never be the same for this
      scientist.<br>
      <br>
      It is obvious that phytocannabinoids are found in abundance in
      nature, is our next step to regulate these plants like cannabis,
      since large doses of the active ingredients may have some
      cannabis-like effects?&nbsp; Maybe less drastic actions should be
      taken.<br>
      <br>
      A lot of work remains for scientists to determine the
      effectiveness of these phytocannabinoids and related
      compounds.&nbsp; If you want to engage in cannabis research, a
      great place to start would be looking at other ingredients of a
      healthy diet for new members of the phytocannabinoid family.<br>
      <br>
      Nature has provided a single plant which produces THC-acid.
      THC-acid readily becomes THC, the most potent phytocannabinoid
      known to man. Why does nature not provide a single other plant
      that produces this compound? When all around us, we can find
      molecular messengers from plants that influence subtle components
      of the endcannabinoid system.<br>
      <br>
      The take home message is that fatty acid derivatives, terpenes,
      and polyphenols are found in numerous plants. Fruits and veggies
      represent another source, if not treasure troves, of compounds
      which may interact with the endocannabinoid system.<br>

            Vaccine Preservative Causes Autism</b><br>

      <br>
      Over 100 Freedom of Records Act (FOIA) requests have finally
      forced the euphemist US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
      (CDC) to admit a widely used vaccine preservative is the
      equivalent of a neurological armageddon.<br>
      <br>
      With help from PhD Scientist and Biochemist, Brian Hooker, the
      agency has finally had to reveal that they have known for years
      that thimerosal, which was banned in 1999, but still used in over
      60 vaccines, causes autism. Robert F. Kennedy has been trying to
      alert the public of the same troublesome findings that Hooker has
      unveiled, but he is often dismissed, or worse, made into a media
      fool by the pharmaceutical industry.<br>
      <br>
      Released in the documents are statements that indicate that the
      CDC has been sitting on information that would be of high value to
      those who have been for years investigating the link between
      vaccines and autism. As reported by Health Advice:<br>
      <br>
      “When the results of the Verstraeten study were first reported
      outside the CDC in 2005, there was no evidence that anyone but Dr.
      Verstraeten within the CDC had known of the very high 7.6-fold
      elevated relative risk of autism from exposure to Thimerosal
      during infancy. But now, clear evidence exists. A newly-acquired
      abstract from 1999 titled, “Increased risk of developmental
      neurologic impairment after high exposure to Thimerosal containing
      vaccine in first month of life” required the approval of top CDC
      officials prior to its presentation at the Epidemic Intelligence
      Service (EIS) conference. Thimerosal, which is 50% mercury by
      weight, was used in most childhood vaccines and in the RhoGAM shot
      for pregnant women prior to the early 2000s.The CDC maintains
      there is “no relationship between Thimerosal-containing vaccines
      and autism rates in children,” even though the data from the CDC’s
      own Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) database shows a very high risk.
      There are a number of public records to back this up, including
      this Congressional Record from May 1, 2003. The CDC’s refusal to
      acknowledge thimerosal’s risks is exemplified by a leaked
      statement from Dr. Marie McCormick, chair of the CDC/NIH-sponsored
      Immunization Safety Review at IOM. Regarding vaccination, she said
      in 2001, “…we are not ever going to come down that it [autism] is
      a true side effect…” Also of note, the former director of the CDC,
      which purchases $4 billion worth of vaccines annually, is now
      president of Merck’s vaccine division.” <br>

      <div align="center"><b>What is Thimerosal and Why Should I Care?</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Thimerosal is a mercury-based vaccine adjuvant (preservative) that
      causes a number of brain-injuring problems, with autism among
      them. Thimerosal is also a human carcinogen, mutagen, and
      teratogen that also interrupts the immune system and interrupts
      proper fetal development.<br>
      <br>
      Thimerosal, is metabolized into toxic, and highly dangerous
      methylmercury. From there, the methylmercury is converted into the
      even more harmful, persistent, inorganic mercury that is retained
      in our physical tissues to wreck havoc on our health. For the
      immune-sensitive, this is the equivalent of a one-two punch. That
      must be why the World Health Organization (WHO) thinks thimerosal
      is ‘safe.’ It follows right along with their covert agenda to thin
      the herd.<br>
      <br>
      There is no safe level of exposure to this neurotoxin, yet it is
      still used widely by Merck, Eli Lilly, and numerous other
      pharmaceutical companies. It is also still used in almost every
      flu vaccine currently administered.<br>
      <br>
      According to Hooker, hundreds of thousands of babies born between
      1991 and 1997, had their vaccine files analyzed by CDC
      epidemiologist Thomas Verstraeten, MD. Hooker says that this,
      “proves unequivocally that during 2000, CDC officers were
      knowledgeable internally of the very high hazard of autism,
      non-natural sleep problem and speech disorder associated with
      Thimerosal exposure.”<br>
      <br>
      CDC as a Murderous Agency<br>
      <br>
      These alarming facts, along with the testimony of whistleblowers
      like Kennedy expose the CDC as a dangerous, even murderous,
      government agency that cannot be trusted. They have lied to
      scientific bodies, fixed data, and withheld important information
      that could have prevented any number of autism cases, among other
      health dangers. With over 22 different medical cases that prove
      vaccines can cause autism, and the latest documentation from
      Hooker that reveals what the CDC has withheld, why would anyone
      trust this agency as a protector of public health?<br>
      <br>
      Hope for the Future<br>
      <br>
      Dr. Hooker’s is adamant about what must happen going forward: “We
      have to make certain that this and different proof of CDC
      malfeasance are supplied to Congress and the general public as
      quick as viable. Time is of the essence. Kid’s futures are at
      stake.” It will take vigilance with propaganda being slung from
      every direction.<br>

      Courts and other government offices operate for only two half-days
      a week, the equivalence of one full day.<br>
      <br>
      Public schools are closed on Fridays.<br>
      <br>
      (2) Water shortage: Water is also being rationed. As an example,
      water arrives just once a week, on Thursdays, to the neighborhood
      of San Antonio de los Altos. But the water is a brownish color and
      is making people sick. Many Venezuelans say they have gotten skin
      irritations from showering or from the inability to bathe and wash
      their sheets and towels.<br>
      <br>
      (3) Food shortages:<br>
      <br>
      Last week, protests turned violent in parts of the country where
      demonstrators demanded empty supermarkets be resupplied.<br>
      <br>
      Coca-Cola Femsa, the Mexican company that bottles Coke in
      Venezuela, said it’s halting production of sugary soft drinks
      because it ran out of sugar.<br>
      <br>
      (4) Many people cannot make international calls from their phones
      because of a dispute between the government and phone companies
      over currency regulations and rates.<br>
      <br>
      (5) There is little traffic in the capital, Caracas, because so
      few people, either for lack of money or work, are going out.
      Buildings downtown, including government buildings, are empty.<br>
      <br>
      (6) Public health crisis: People are dying in hospitals, from
      electric blackouts, broken medical machines (X-ray, dialysis,
      scanning, incubators), and chronic shortages of medicine
      (antibiotics, intravenous solutions), bandages, soap, gloves,
      beds, water (doctors preparing for surgery at the University of

      A battery system and method of operation are shown. The battery
      system utilizes a microparticle fuel slurry containing
      microparticle spheres surrounded by active electrochemical
      material. In the operation of the battery system, the
      microparticle spheres are attracted to battery-cell electrode
      plates and held there by a magnetic field. The core of the
      microparticle spheres and battery-cell electrode plates may be
      permanently magnetic or ferromagnetic in nature. The magnetic
      field may originate from permanently magnetic materials or be
      induced using magnetic field windings or the like. The battery
      system may be recharged by replacing spent microparticle fuel
      slurry with unspent slurry. In some applications, such as when
      used to power an electro-motive vehicle, a reserve of unspent
      microparticle fuel slurry may be stored on-board the vehicle and
      used to periodically replace spent microparticle fuel slurry
      during operation. In such applications, when the on-board storage
      of unspent fuel slurry has been spent, the battery system may be
      refueled with a new supply of unspent fuel slurry without
      interrupting operation of the battery.<br>

      Hercolubus, in the Latin American pseudoscience scene, is a giant
      planet that supposedly will approach the Earth with catastrophic
      results, similar to the Nibiru/Planet X claims.<br>
      <br>
      Its most recent promoter is the Colombian New Age author V.M.
      Rabolu (real name: Joaquin Enrique Amortegui Valbuena, 1926-2000).
      According to (a promotional video of) his free book, Hercolubus or
      Red Planet:[1]<br>
      <br>
      on a previous approach, it wiped out Atlantis and a civilization
      that inhabited it, which inspired all global flood myths<br>
      its proximity will cause volcanic eruptions and earthquakes, and
      ultimately - a pole shift<br>
      it will also cause a deadly epidemic that "official science" will
      be powerless to stop<br>
      the only escape is... "the elimination of psychological defects"
      and... astral projection<br>
      Those "who work on their spiritual regeneration" will be "taken to
      a safe place".<br>
      <br>
      Hercolubus or Red Planet was written in 1998/1999, but Rabolu
      apparently picked the idea from his "teacher" - Samael Aun Weor,
      who in the 1970s preached about Hercolubus being the end of the
      world in religious terms, as a punishment for the "shameful
      humanity that deserves the karma that approaches" and that "did
      not want to listen to the voice of the prophets".[2] Being the
      founder of a theosophy/anthroposophy-influenced New Age "gnostic"
      church, he also threw Atlantis and the Kali Yuga into the mix.[3]
      In his version, Hercolubus is a part of the "distant solar system
      of Tylo", which he identifies[3] as Barnard's Star.[4] Needless to
      say, despite his claims to the contrary, Hercolubus is not an
      accepted scientific fact.<br>
      <br>
      ZetaTalk quotes a Hercolubus prophecy to bolster its claims about
      "Planet X", though they cite another origin - the channeled
      prophecies of other South Americans.[5] In the Brazilian version,
      the planet is orbiting an invisible star called Tia and enters the
      Solar System every 6666 years.[5]<br>
      <br>
      In recent times, some of the 2012 supporters have outright
      conflated it with the already conflated pair Planet X/Nibiru. It's
      not that they have a great choice of actions - it's either that,
      or claiming that there are multiple incoming planets.&nbsp; <br>

      Last week, Dr. Ronald Shimschuck provided exclusive information on
      the impending Nibiru crisis, a situation worldwide governments are
      desperate to conceal while discrediting–and in some cases
      disappearing–all credible whistle blowers. Naturally, those with
      genuine scientific knowledge have been reluctant to speak on the

      X.&nbsp; Lately, however, several professional astronomers have
      risen from the shadows to voice their concerns regarding Nibiru
      and its potential effects on planet earth. One can only speculate
      as to why, now, after all these years, prolific members of the
      scientific community are choosing to disclose “highly classified”
      information at great risk to their safety, and in doing so also
      place their loved ones in a perilous position. Please take the

      <br>
      Someonesbones: Dr. Shimschuck, thank you once again for taking the
      time to speak to us about this very important subject.<br>
      <br>
      Dr. Shimschuck: You’re welcome. I’m always a bit nervous about
      this but it’s the right thing to do.<br>
      <br>
      SB: Let’s start with same basics. Why have you gone public?<br>
      <br>
      DS: I still wrestle with that decision every day. And, to be
      frank, I’m by no means certain going public, as you say, has any
      benefit. It may, it may not. As a scientist, I spent much of my
      life seeking simple answers to difficult questions. Going public
      is the most difficult question I’ve faced. I’m dedicated to the
      truth, and for a long time I helped conceal a truth that could
      cost millions or billions of lives. Like many of my colleagues, I
      feared for my life, for that of my beloved Darlene, God rest her
      soul–she passed away a year ago. Now I have no living relatives.
      And my conscious could no long bear the burden of guilt. I had to
      go public, for humanity.”<br>
      <br>
      SB: Are you saying “they” threatened your family if you exposed
      information on Nibiru?<br>
      <br>
      DS: They didn’t have to explicitly say it; the threat was implied.
      This reason, as I believe a previous interviewee pointed out, is
      why people with knowledge don’t make deathbed confessions: for
      fear some harm will come to loved ones. There was no doubt in my
      mind that had I talked a year or two ago, that they would have got
      to her first, to make me suffer, then taken care of me. They can’t
      take her from me now.<br>
      <br>
      SB: How do you explain the sudden surge of astronomers now willing
      to talk about Nibiru. Many do have living families. Aren’t they
      jeopardizing their families’ safety?<br>
      <br>
      DS: Although I can speak only definitively for myself, I can
      speculate: In a row of dominoes, when one falls, they all fall.
      Here we have the opposite, one man standing up after another,
      essentially reinforcing its companion. Safety in numbers, that
      sort of thing. I doubt I would have come forward if others, like
      Dr. Eugene Ricks, hadn’t taken that first, bold step. More
      importantly, we have reached a precipice; five, ten, thirty years
      ago, world governments had a “safety net,” the mistaken belief
      they could conceal the truth almost indefinitely. Well, that time
      has elapsed, and though they hate to admit it, I believe they
      realize the truth about the interloper cannot be hidden much
      longer.”<br>
      <br>
      SB: That makes sense. How long has the government(s) known about
      Nibiru? And have they all worked together to keep it secret?<br>
      <br>
      DS: First, I believe they’ve known since the 50s, but I’m positive
      since the early 80s. And, yes, major world governments, each
      preparing in its their own ways, conspired against the world’s
      population to keep this the most carefully kept secret in the
      history of so-called secrets. The big three–US, Russia, China–have
      been in “Secondary Protocol” for some time, meaning their
      underground living quarters are prepared, secondary and
      provisional governments stand ready, and I could talk for hours on
      that alone.<br>
      <br>
      SB: Perhaps if we have the chance for another interview. In our
      previous discussion, you said that chem-trails are one method via
      which the powers that be try to hide Nibiru. To play Devil’s
      advocate, you previously stated Nibiru is still far enough away
      that it’s visible only at high altitudes in the southern
      hemisphere, with powerful optics. So why would they need to
      currently employ chemicles? And how do you respond to detractors
      who say that chem-trailing has a different purpose, like, say, to
      poison the population?<br>
      <br>
      DS: I’ll answer the second part of the question first: It’s
      entirely possible that atmospheric aerosol spraying serves
      multiple purposes. I really don’t know. But nothing surprises me
      anymore. I know as fact one reason is to impede, obscure, and
      delay visibility of the Nibiru system. This I know because I saw
      documentation on the subject. They are spraying now–have been for
      years–because the chemicals, and I wasn’t privy to the precise
      chemical composition, translucent, reflective nano fibers act
      energetically with aluminum oxide, another ingredient,&nbsp; to
      create a barrier, screen, or “haze” to limit visibility of both
      natural and artificial optics. There is marginal degradation over
      time, but the compound persists in the atmosphere and continues to
      build upon itself.<br>
      <br>
      SB: As simply as possibly, what is “Nibiru?”<br>
      <br>
      DS: It is a generic or catch-all term for what I and others refer
      to as “the Nibiru System,” essentially a solar system of its own
      which will intersect with ours. At its heart is a brown dwarf star
      approximately one-eighth the size of our sun. The brown dwarf is
      orbited by seven planets or moons, some smaller than our moon,
      some larger than earth. Of greatest concern is the third planet of
      this system–several times earth’s mass with a nickel-iron core. It
      is predicted this planet will pass within 0.3 AU of earth.<br>
      <br>
      SB: How far is that in layman’s terms?<br>
      <br>
      DS: 27886742 miles, or one-third the distance from earth-to-sun<br>
      <br>
      SB: So no direct impact. We know your time is limited so I’ll
      finish up quick here. Worst and best case scenarios?<br>
      <br>
      DS: Worst: Extinction Level Event. Nothing on the planet will
      survive. Not even bacteria. Best: Pole Shift accompanied by rising
      sea levels across all major bodies of water, volcanic eruptions,
      Tsunamis washing hundreds of miles inland. Magnitude 10
      earthquakes along all major fault lines; six-to-eight in many
      other areas. Basically, all the worst parts of the Bible.<br>
      <br>
      SB: When will it be here?<br>
      <br>
      DS: Views differ. Some colleagues and I agree that events will
      unfold between September and December of 2016.<br>
      <br>
      SB: As always, thank you for your time, Dr. Shimschuck. I hope we
      can chat with you again at least once more.<br>
      <br>
      DS: Me too.<br>

          EVENT CLOSE IN TIME</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      There is a prophecy that has survived through the ages. A warning
      that refers to the end of an era for this human race. A recurring
      event that ended the Atlantean civilization and is coming back
      again. It is the prophecy of Hercolubus, a gigantic world coming
      to our solar system, which will look like another sun when it is
      at its closest to us. This ancient prophecy is about to be
      fulfilled and will soon be world-wide broadcasted news. It is
      vital for you to know that the close proximity of this planet will
      cause a general catastrophe on Earth. This is not something far in
      the future and it concerns you more than you think. There is
      factual information on this subject in the book entitled
      Hercolubus or Red Planet. The Alcione Association is sending free
      copies to any country worldwide. <br>

      <i>21st Century Wire says</i>…<br>
      <br>
      Does this explain the sudden rise of ‘transgender mania’
      throughout the mainstream media and entertainment complex?<br>
      <br>
      Ever since North Carolina became the first U.S. state to require
      transgender people to use restrooms in public buildings and
      schools that match the sex on their birth certificate rather than
      their gender identity – the “transgender” political issue has
      dominated American media headlines.<br>
      <br>
      Similarly, last year it was reality TV celebrity Caitlin (Bruce)
      Jenner who grabbed the lion’s share of media impressions.<br>
      <br>
      Suddenly, all things transgender are elevated to prominence.<br>
      <br>
      Author and academic Camille Paglia has branded the rise of what
      she calls ‘transgender mania’, as a ‘symptom of cultural
      collapse’. Paglia says:<br>
      <br>
      “Sex reassignment surgery, even today with all of its advances,
      cannot in fact change anyone’s sex.”<br>
      <br>
      “Ultimately, every single cell in the human body, the DNA in that
      cell, remains coded for your biological birth.”<br>
      <br>
      “I think that the transgender propagandists make wildly inflated
      claims about the multiplicity of gender.”<br>
      <br>
      “Everywhere in the world you find this pattern in ancient times:
      that as a culture begins to decline, you have an efflorescence of
      transgender phenomena. That is a symptom of cultural collapse.”<br>
      <br>
      Watch the full interview with the author below, where she brands
      parents who help young children attempt to change their gender as
      ‘child abusers’...<br>
