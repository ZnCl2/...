          Did you know that when you browse the web the search term you
          just typed is being passed on to the websites that you have
          visited? Lately people are becoming more aware of this
          relationship between major search engines, internet service
          providers and the NSA since the Lamestream media has began to
          cover the information release from Edward Snowden.<br>
          Thankfully Gibiru has known about this relationship for years
          and has been providing a free Uncensored Anonymous Search
          Engine since 2009. The truth is, these mainstream search
          engines and websites you visit are storing these terms along
          with your IP address and setting cookies onto your computer
          that enable them to track you everywhere you go to show more
          targeted advertisements to you as well as offering access to
          this big data to Government contractors and agencies.<br>
          Why should you care?<br>
          Well the answer is simple, not only is this basic invasion of
          privacy, but it is illegal under the Federal Wiretap Law of
          1968. If CISPA were to become law it would grant businesses
          and the government an unprecedented ability to share data
          without the need to consider anti-trust or classification
          laws. Hacked businesses would be granted legal immunity if
          they acted in "good faith" to protect their networks, thanks
          to a part of the bill whose broad language has drawn the ire
          of consumer and privacy advocates...<br>

          <b><br>
          </b>My new peer-reviewed article just published yesterday can
          redefine how we think and speak about GMOs, Roundup®, and
          organic diets. I know it does for me. At the same time, it
          strengthens our commitment to eating organic. It’s likely the
          most important piece I’ve ever written.<br>
          <br>
          Survey results reveal that 3,256 people reported improvements
          in 28 health conditions after reducing their GMO intake. An
          astonishing 85% of respondents reported improvements in their
          “digestive problems,” the ailment most commonly cited. Of
          these respondents, 80% said their digestive issues were
          “significantly improved”, “nearly gone”, or “completely
          recovered”.<br>
          <br>
          Remarkably, at least half the respondents also reported
          recovery from fatigue, obesity, brain fog, food allergies, and
          anxiety or depression...<br>

          </b>The title is actually a pretty good summary, but the first
          paragraph clarifies:<br>
          <br>
          The European nuclear research center known as CERN has banned
          Professor Alessandro Strumia of Pisa University after he gave
          a slide presentation at a conference that discussed
          male/female differences in career outcomes in the field of
          physics.<br>
          <br>
          Physics is one of those fields where gender differences are
          obvious to anyone with eyeballs (perhaps “bodybuilding” is the
          only field where it’s even more obvious there are differences
          between males and females). The vast bulk of grad students in
          physics are male, and by extension the vast bulk of Ph.D.s in
          Physics are held by males.<br>
          <br>
          Trouble is, the ideology demands you only hire males if there
          are no females available…and this situation comes up very
          quickly in Physics. Rather than adjust the ideology to allow
          for reality, the push has been to make it easier for a female
          to get a Ph.D. in Physics.<br>

          Sweet Misery is a close examination into what many in the
          medical community have voiced over the last few decades on the
          safety of Aspartame sweetener. Is there a connection with
          Aspartame and illnesses? Did the government (including Donald
          Rumsfeld) push the approval of the sweetener and suppress key
          data? This film delves into the FDA's process and the various
          reports of health risks associated with the widely used
          sweetener.<b><br>

          </b>Aaron and Melissa Dykes of TruthstreamMedia were driving
          outside of Dallas near the small farming town of Milford,
          Texas, when a strange tower in the middle of a field caught
          their eye. It almost seemed like a joke because the shape was
          unmistakable. It looked just like Tesla/"
          "&gt;Nikola Tesla’s Wardenclyffe Tower, the
          legendary experimental wireless transmission station he built
          in 1901 in Shoreham, New York to transmit phone calls, fax
          images and electrical power but which was demolished 16 years
          later due to bankruptcy.<br>
          <br>
          A little bit of research revealed that the tower’s owners are
          Viziv Technologies and that the structure is, in fact a Tesla

          <b><br>
            WHAT IT IS<br>
          </b>Our Viziv surface wave system allows the Earth itself to
          be used for clean, safe and efficient transfer of power
          between any two points on the globe, wirelessly. The system
          represents a paradigm shift in the science of
          electromagnetics.<br>
          <br>
          Today’s power distribution system of wired grids is fragile
          and aging.&nbsp; The transition to a global wireless system
          utilizing the Zenneck surface wave is a breakthrough that will
          effectively “cut the cord” between power generation facilities
          and the local distribution grids.&nbsp; This breakthrough will
          significantly enhance energy surety, reliability, and
          resiliency of the world’s electrical distribution systems.<br>
          <b><br>
            HOW IT WORKS<br>
          </b>Viziv Technologies has developed a system of
          patent-pending processes and equipment to efficiently launch
          the Zenneck surface wave. Currently, our research and
          commercialization efforts are focused on energy transfer and
          communications, but we recognize that this technology has the
          potential to impact numerous sectors of the economy.<br>
          <br>
          A Zenneck Surface Wave is an electromagnetic wave that uses
          the surface of the earth as a waveguide enabling it to carry
          communications signals or electrical power efficiently over
          long distances.<br>
          <br>
          This wireless power system will employ a “transmitter probe,”
          located near a power generation plant, to launch a Zenneck
          carrier wave.&nbsp; Receiver antennae will be positioned
          appropriately around the world to receive the signal and
          download the power into a local microgrid or conventional grid
          architecture.<br>
          <br>
          The wave is impervious to weather effects such as lightning or
          geomagnetic disturbance or electromagnetic pulses (EMP),
          including those associated with a nuclear detonation.&nbsp;
          Unlike a wired grid, the Zenneck wave cannot be physically
          attacked and cyber attacks would be challenged to target or
          cause cascading failures to a wireless system.<br>
          <br>
          When launched, the Zenneck Surface Wave literally envelops the
          planet like a balloon, enabling transmitter probes to be
          placed anywhere power can be generated and receivers to be
          placed anywhere power is needed....<br>

          Engineers conference, provides an overview of Viziv wireless
          power systems, its evolution, and implications for the future:<br>

          An internal expansion engine having a housing. Secured to the
          housing is a cylinder defining an expansion chamber. A piston
          is provided within the cylinder defining a wall of the
          expansion chamber. A charge of noble gas is provided within
          the expansion chamber. A magnetic field generator and radio
          frequency power generator is provided around the expansion
          chamber and an initiator system is located within the
          expansion chamber. The magnetic field generator, radio
          frequency power generator and initiator system coact to cause
          the noble gas to expand, pushing against the piston and
          generating work. The actions of the engine are monitored and
          controlled by an intelligent electronic control system that
          provides all switching needed to operate the engine and
          communicate with outside elements providing external control
          of information sources.<br>

          SEC HALTS “PLASMA ENGINE” INVESTMENT SCHEME OPERATED BY JOHN
          ROHNER AND HIS NEVADA COMPANIES<br>
          <br>
          The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced an
          enforcement action previously filed under seal in federal
          court in Las Vegas. The SEC has obtained an emergency order to
          halt an investment scheme that has defrauded at least 98
          people nationwide out of at least $1.4 million since 2009.<br>
          <br>
          Notice that NO CORPORATION, owned or founded by JOHN ROHNER,
          on this list was from started before March of 2011. So why did
          they use this date, as it is wrong? Also PlasmERG, Inc., Nor
          PTP Licensing LTD., were in default at this time, not ever
          valid (placeholders). NO Stock was ever issued stock except to
          the ME.. Even Inteligentry was incomplete without it's final
          meeting under Nevada Law. So NOT even VALID yet. The SEC never
          filed any "Investor" sworn statement that alleged any crime.
          The FBI could find no crime either.<br>
          <br>
          The SEC’s complaint alleges that Nevada resident John P.
          Rohner and his companies Inteligentry, Ltd., PlasmERG, Inc.
          and PTP Licensing, Ltd., have been operating a fraudulent
          investment scheme. Rohner and his companies solicited
          investors for the scheme by claiming that they have developed,
          tested and patented an operational “plasma engine” fueled by
          abundant and inexpensive noble gases (such as helium), which
          they claim will replace the internal combustion engine. Rohner
          and his companies claim that the engine is non-polluting and
          has unlimited uses to generate electricity in homes,
          businesses, boats, and aircraft. For example, Rohner told at
          least one investor that one of his plasma engines has been
          running a generator on a dairy farm for 18 months and he
          claimed on company websites that the pollution-free engine
          “can run for over 3 months on a $12 gas fill”. As alleged in
          the complaint, Rohner originally offered securities in
          Iowa-based PlasmERG, Inc. from 2009 to early 2011, and from
          May 2011 to the present Rohner has offered securities in
          Nevada-based Inteligentry, Ltd., using PlasmERG and PTP
          Licensing as related business entities... &amp;c<br>

          Appellant court pages. Actually the only case going forward is
          John Rohner's, seems the Circuit court ruled that the
          "Investors" group, as a class, does not have any standing
          after having their monies and assets stolen by Girouard and
          the SEC.<br>
          SO STAY TUNED AS WE MAY GET SOME JUSTICE YET!!!<br>
          <br>
          In the latest filing by the SEC employee, the receiver,
          showing how she will follow the SEC suggestions, how else?,
          and disperse the funds. Yup, She even filed everything under
          "SEAL" to make sure no one can see the rip off and liars. As
          expected the GREEDY, Lying Dr Girouard is getting the biggest
          percent. Seems his "Loan" was converted, by the SEC, to an
          "investment", even with the matter of the US Dist Court in
          Iowa's order.<br>
          Anyway it is funny reading as the SEC hides everything..
          Reminds you of the wannabe president, we have. See "DIST
          COURT" page..<br>
          <br>
          SEVERAL APPEALS, on behalf of Rohner and the RAPED
          "Inteligentry Investors" was filed.. NOW IT IS OUR TURN see
          "Appellant Court" page..<br>
          NEXT WE GET THE BOOKS and magazine articles out as there is no
          hold anymore.Also the International Corporation is working for
          "Proof" engines soon in Mexico and China.<br>
          Be advised, that Rohner is being paid nothing from any of
          this. It all goes to the Inteligentry Investors Foundation.<br>

              5G rollout by Gateshead Council where residents are
              complaining of increased illness and Cancer in the
              affected area. There’s enough evidence to conclude the new
              smart 5G arrays on the top of new LED lampposts emit Class
              1 Radiation frequencies and should be treated as a danger
              to the Public. Gateshead Council ignorantly rebutted clear
              evidence and created false allegations on social media
              posts and printed leaflets stating that Mark Steele is
              spreading Pseudo Science and that the arrays are not
              dangerous or 5G:<br>

                Excerpt: </font></b><font color="#000000">...China has
              a serious food production problem.&nbsp; The California
              drought, as I have covered before is the product of
              weather manipulation. The artificially contrived
              California drought combined with an increasing Chinese
              presence in California will ultimately lead to a complete
              Chinese takeover of all California’s agricultural farm
              land. The Chinese military, posed as energy front men at
              the many solar farms will soon spring into action and
              seize all major farmland following the completion of
              CalExit. Chinese soldiers which are present in large
              numbers at the California Inland Ports (e.g. Sacramento
              and Stockton) and they are poised to takeover.<br>
              <br>
              How is this possible? Enter Dianne Feinstein and her
              husband Richard Blum. Feinstein entered the Senate as a
              millionaire and is now a billionaire. Their conflicts of
              interest are legendary. California and the EPA have
              enacted policies that drive farmers and ranchers off of
              their land by the thousands. This exodus of California
              farmers is being accomplished through the denial of water
              to ranchers and farmers. Richard Blum is buying up
              distressed properties and then selling them back to
              Chinese interests. In other words, China is in the process
              of controlling California’s food supply when CALEXIT
              becomes a reality. The food will be sent back to China as
              an offset against the Chinese increasing agricultural
              shortfalls. This will produce catastrophic consequences
              regard food supplies and prices in the near future in the
              United States. I should note that the globalist desire to
              destroy the United States takes a big step forward with
              this plan.<br>
              <br>
              To add to the coming misery, I interviewed Paul Martin and
              he stated that his colleague, Ed Petrowski provided Paul
              with information that there is an acute national shortage
              of farmers. Record numbers of farms are being auctioned
              off. Paul said that Ed told him we are headed for a major
              famine in the United States.<br>

              effects as non-living matter, concludes an international
              team of scientists. This is the first time that quantum
              mechanical behavior was proven to exist in biological
              systems that are involved in photosynthesis. The
              interpretation of these quantum effects in photosynthesis

              interacting with quantised light, using the Dicke model.
              Our analysis shows that the strong coupling between the
              bacteria and the light, when both are treated
              quantum-mechanically, indicates that in those experiments
              there is entanglement between the bacteria (modelled as

              measured in those experiments for a range of different
              parameters, ensures the negativity of energy (with respect
              to the lowest energy of separable states), thus acting as
              an entanglement witness.</font></font><br>

                Excerpt: ...</font></b><font color="#000000">China has a
              serious food production problem.&nbsp; The California
              drought, as I have covered before is the product of
              weather manipulation. The artificially contrived
              California drought combined with an increasing Chinese
              presence in California will ultimately lead to a complete
              Chinese takeover of all California’s agricultural farm
              land. The Chinese military, posed as energy front men at
              the many solar farms will soon spring into action and
              seize all major farmland following the completion of
              CalExit. Chinese soldiers which are present in large
              numbers at the California Inland Ports (e.g. Sacramento
              and Stockton) and they are poised to takeover.<br>
              <br>
              How is this possible? Enter Dianne Feinstein and her
              husband Richard Blum. Feinstein entered the Senate as a
              millionaire and is now a billionaire. Their conflicts of
              interest are legendary. California and the EPA have
              enacted policies that drive farmers and ranchers off of
              their land by the thousands. This exodus of California
              farmers is being accomplished through the denial of water
              to ranchers and farmers. Richard Blum is buying up
              distressed properties and then selling them back to
              Chinese interests. In other words, China is in the process
              of controlling California’s food supply when CALEXIT
              becomes a reality. The food will be sent back to China as
              an offset against the Chinese increasing agricultural
              shortfalls. This will produce catastrophic consequences
              regard food supplies and prices in the near future in the
              United States. I should note that the globalist desire to
              destroy the United States takes a big step forward with
              this plan.<br>
              <br>
              To add to the coming misery, I interviewed Paul Martin and
              he stated that his colleague, Ed Petrowski provided Paul
              with information that there is an acute national shortage
              of farmers. Record numbers of farms are being auctioned
              off. Paul said that Ed told him we are headed for a major
              famine in the United States.<br>

              Scientists hail breakthrough as results of the world’s
              largest experiment confirm fruit and vegetable output can
              soar without chemical pesticides and fertilisers<br>
              <br>
              Chinese growers have the answer to a question that has
              been baffling scientists for three centuries: Can
              electricity boost plant growth?<br>
              <br>
              To find out, China has been conducting the world’s largest
              experiment and the results are transforming agricultural
              production in the world’s most populous nation with a
              jolt.<br>
              <br>
              Across the country, from Xinjiang’s remote Gobi Desert to
              the developed coastal areas facing the Pacific Ocean,
              vegetable greenhouse farms with a combined area of more
              than 3,600 hectares (8,895 acres) have been taking part in
              an “electro culture” programme funded by the Chinese
              government.<br>
              <br>
              Last month the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences
              and other government research institutes released the
              findings of nearly three decades of study in areas with
              different climate, soil conditions and plantation habits.
              They are hailing the results as a breakthrough.<br>
              <br>
              The technique has boosted vegetable output by 20 to 30 per
              cent. Pesticide use has decreased 70 to 100 per cent. And
              fertiliser consumption has dropped more than 20 per cent.<br>
              <br>
              The vegetables grow under bare copper wires, set about
              three metres (10 feet) above ground level and stretching
              end to end under the greenhouse roof. The wires are
              capable of generating rapid, positive charges as high as
              50,000 volts, or more than 400 times the standard
              residential voltage in the US.<br>
              <br>
              The high frequency electricity kills bacteria and
              virus-transmitting diseases in the air or soil. It also
              suppresses the surface tension of water on leaves,
              accelerating vaporisation.<br>
              <br>
              Within the plants, the transport of naturally charged
              particles, such as bicarbonate and calcium ions, speed up
              and metabolic activities, like carbon dioxide absorption
              and photosynthesis, also increase.<br>
              <br>
              Professor Liu Binjiang, government agriculture scientist
              and a leading member of the project, said the electric
              current flowing through the wires is only a few millionths
              of an ampere by volume – lower than a smartphone cable’s
              workload.<br>
              <br>
              “It does absolutely no harm to the plants or to humans
              standing nearby,” he said.<br>
              <br>
              Thanks to the positive findings of the study, the area
              devoted to electrified farms in China is now growing with
              unprecedented speed, according to Liu, from 1,000 to 1,300
              hectares each year.<br>
              <br>
              That means up to 40 per cent growth in electro culture
              farming could be achieved within the next 12 months.<br>
              <br>
              “Most recent investments have come from the private
              sector,” Liu said. “The business is taking off. We are
              supplying the technology and equipment to other countries
              including the Netherlands, United States, Australia and
              Malaysia.<br>

              <b>THE HISTORY</b><br>
              <br>
              It was not always so. In fact, China was more than 200
              years late to the game.<br>
              <br>
              In 1746, just a few years before Benjamin Franklin sent a
              kite to catch lightning in a storm, Dr Maimbray of
              Edinburgh in Scotland electrified two myrtles.<br>
              <br>
              He observed the trees put forth new branches in October,
              something which had never happened before.<br>
              <br>
              The news travelled. Many similar studies were carried out
              across Europe, some confirming Maimbray’s findings, others
              not.<br>
              Scientists conquer the ‘Mount Everest of genetics’ after
              unlocking secrets of wheat genome<br>
              <br>
              One experiment in Turin, Italy, for instance, found the
              plants became unfruitful and wilted after an unusually
              prolific period.<br>
              <br>
              In 1902, physics professor S. Lemstroem visited the Arctic
              region and discovered some trees grew faster under the
              aurora borealis than those in milder climates further
              south.<br>
              <br>
              Lemstroem attributed the phenomenon to the natural
              electrical conditions produced by the aurora, also known
              as the northern lights. He conducted a series of
              experiments in the laboratory to prove it and even wrote a
              book to promote his hypothesis.<br>
              <br>
              British physicist Sir Oliver Lodge, a key inventor in the
              development of radio, read the book and reportedly
              achieved a 24 to 39 per cent increase in wheat grain yield
              in an eight-hectare experiment.<br>
              <br>
              It caught the attention of governments. The British and
              American authorities each commissioned separate studies on
              electro culture in the early 20th century.<br>
              <br>
              The British findings were positive, while the American
              results were negative.<br>
              <br>
              [Vegetables growing under wires which are capable of
              generating rapid, positive charges more than 400 times the

              <br>
              These experiments were mostly small and conducted in open
              fields, with conditions which varied from one location to
              another. The wide range of natural elements affected the
              final output and there was no universal standard for
              hardware design or technical details such as voltage and
              frequency.<br>
              <br>
              The scientists in these pioneering studies also lacked
              advanced equipment, such as today’s portable spectrum
              analyser, to study the plant’s response to electricity at
              the molecular level.<br>
              <br>
              As a consequence, explanations of the observed phenomenon
              remained speculative and interest waned with the advent of
              chemical fertilisers and pesticides to achieve mass
              agricultural production.<br>

              <b>CHINA TAKES THE LEAD</b><b><br>
              </b><br>
              Public interest in electro culture revived with the rise
              of organic farming and the Chinese government started
              funding experiments in the technique in 1990.<br>
              <br>
              He Feng, senior technician of Yufa Jingnan Vegetable
              Production and Sales, one of Beijing’s largest vegetable
              producers, said the company had taken part in the
              programme since 2014 and the results were “very
              satisfactory”.<br>
              <br>
              In just two years the electrified vegetables had brought
              in extra revenue of nearly 1.2 million yuan (US$175,000).<br>
              <br>
              “We are still running the equipment, which consumes very
              little power,” he said.<br>
              <br>
              [The electro culture technique has boosted vegetable
              output by 20 to 30 per cent while pesticide use has

              <br>
              One hectare of electrified greenhouse requires about 15
              kilowatt-hours of electricity per day, which is about half
              the power usage of an average American family.<br>
              <br>
              Inside the greenhouse the air smells like the aftermath of
              a summer thunderstorm. Humidity is low and the plants
              rarely get sick.<br>
              <br>
              The biggest burden is the installation cost, He said, with
              the necessary hardware costing tens of thousands of yuan.
              Without government support, the company could not have
              afforded to wire up all its greenhouses.<br>
              <br>
              Liu Yongyi, owner of City Luhai Xinghua Sightseeing
              Agriculture company in Beijing’s Daxing district, which is
              also engaging in electro culture, said the technology
              would significantly improve China’s food safety by
              massively reducing the use of pesticides.<br>
              <br>
              “Pesticide residue is a huge threat to public health.
              Electricity provides a physical solution to disease and
              pest control. It is much cleaner than chemicals. The
              government should subsidise the electro culture
              revolution,” he said.<br>
              <br>
              Liu said visitors to the farm were intrigued when they saw
              the system at work and he believed the public would be
              quick to embrace the technology.<br>
              <br>
              “The theory is easy to understand. I believe people would
              be willing to pay a premium for electrified vegetables and
              fruits in the near future,” he said.<br>
              <br>
              Professor Guo Yalong, a researcher at the Chinese Academy
              of Beijing’s Institute of Botany, said the impact of
              electricity on plant “definitely exists”.<br>
              <br>
              “Electricity is like air and water. It is part of the
              natural environment,” said Guo, who was not involved in
              the project.<br>
              <br>
              “Many ionised particles in plants have either negative or
              positive charges. They can respond to the presence of a
              man-made electric field nearby,” he said.<br>
              <br>
              China has greenhouses covering more than 4 million
              hectares, producing nearly 1 trillion yuan worth of
              vegetables each year.<br>
              <br>
              Professor Liu said there were no plans to electrify them
              all, as the investment would be unaffordable for most
              farmers.<br>
              <br>
              His project team is taking a different approach and
              developing a compact, all-in-one vegetable growing chamber
              using electro culture technology.<br>
              <br>
              “Each family would be able to grow their own food in the
              kitchen, on the balcony or in the backyard,” he said.<br>
              <br>
              The chamber uses an artificial light source and electric
              field to stimulate plant growth and prevent diseases.
              Operation is automatic and almost care and maintenance
              free.<br>
              <br>
              “One day these tiny chambers may become an alternative to
              large scale farms,” Liu said. “That would trigger another
              agricultural revolution.”<br>

                Government Loses Vaccine Lawsuit<br>
                Has Lied to the Public for Decades — Vaccines NOT Tested
              </b></font><br>
            <br>
          </div>
          …Vaccine injury lawyer Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Del Bigtree,
          producer of the suppressed anti-vaccine documentary, Vaxxed
          and the Informed Consent Action Network (ICAN) are credited
          with this victory. They demanded the relevant government
          documents proving that all federally approved vaccines had
          been tested for quality over the past 32 years — and there
          were none.<br>
          <br>
          Here are the huge legal and practical implications in this
          legal victory for the American people:<br>
          <br>
          This means that the US Department of Health and Human Services
          and all vaccine makers have been lying to the American people
          for over 30 years about the effectiveness and safety of
          vaccines; this may ultimately mean that continuing the
          existence — at least in their current form — of five US
          “healthcare” agencies are now in doubt: the CDC, the FDA, the
          IOM, the NIH and the “Health” part of DHHS itself; this may
          also threaten the existence of state medical boards and
          exclusive medical guilds like the AMA:<br>
          <br>
          This means that vaccine makers have been fraudulently exempt
          from what all other pharmaceutical drug makers have been
          forced to do concerning biannual recertification for quality
          and effectiveness — meaning that that their vaccines have
          never been tested for quality and have had no proven safety or
          effectiveness for over 30 years;<br>
          <br>
          This case can now be legally cited by all parents fraudulently
          mandated by any government/organizational
          regulation/requirements that they must vaccinate their
          children for school or any other activity to stop the forced
          vaccination of their children;<br>
          <br>
          This case can now be legally cited by all employees being
          mandated by their employers to be vaccinated in order to
          retain their jobs;<br>
          <br>
          This case can now be legally cited by all those who seek
          compensation for vaccine injury, making it likely that the
          pharmacidical vaccine industry can in the near future be
          legally bankrupted out of existence, like Bayer-Monsanto after
          the landmark legal victory won by the dying landscaper in San
          Francisco several weeks ago, as well as their stock value
          plummeting precipitously;<br>
          <br>
          The future of allopathic medicine in its current form is now
          in doubt, as well as that of the global pharmacidical cartel,
          since almost all of the drugs allopathic practitioners
          prescribe come from pharmacidical corporations which have also
          committed vaccine fraud and injury;<br>
          <br>
          The existence of the deep-state corporate mainstream news
          media will now also be further endangered, since 70% of their
          income stream comes from the global pharmacidical cartel,
          which in America has been responsible for 750,000-1 million
          human sacrifices per year for at least the past half century;<br>
          <br>
          Autism rates will now likely plummet, freeing the American
          people from another deep state-engineered debility, and
          providing further evidence of mass vaccination-caused autism;<br>
          <br>
          All government officials who have passed laws legalizing
          vaccine fraud at the state, national, or international level,
          or otherwise aided and abetted this vaccine fraud can now be
          charged with vaccine fraud, criminal malfeasance and in some
          cases, war crimes under the Nuremberg Code.<b><br>

                Nettles</b></font><br>
          </div>
          <b><br>
          </b>...Perhaps its most popular use is turning the leaves into
          stinging nettle tea, which is a common natural allergy relief
          remedy. It’s also proven to benefit skin, bone, and urinary
          health as well. Nettle also contains vitamins C and K, B
          vitamins, as well as minerals like calcium, magnesium, and
          iron. It also has amino acids and antioxidants, which may help
          fight free radicals.<br>
          <br>
          The antioxidant properties of the nettle plant have been
          observed to help minimize inflammation. It can be used
          topically to help relieve joint pain as well.<br>
          <br>
          One of the more common uses of nettle is to treat allergies,
          as mentioned before. Nettle can alleviate an allergic
          reaction. While physical contact with the nettle leaf can
          cause allergic reactions, the ingestion of nettle tea is known
          to help dampen the body’s response to allergens by binding
          with the body’s histamine receptors. It can aid in the
          prevention of rhinitis (inflammation of the mucous membrane of
          the nose as the result of a virus, aka. the common cold) and
          act as a soothing remedy for the congestion.<br>
          <br>
          BPH (Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia) symptoms and urinary issues
          can also be treated using stinging nettle. Often the symptoms
          of BPH are caused by an enlarged prostate gland pressing on
          the urethra. BPH sufferers experience varying levels of
          increased urges to urinate, incomplete emptying of the
          bladder, painful urination, post urination dripping, and
          reduced urinary flow. A testosterone-induced BPH study on rats
          has shown that stinging nettle may be as effective at treating
          this condition as finasteride, the medication most commonly
          used to treat BPH....<br>

                  This issue has typically been exacerbated with
                  3D-printed graphene aerogel electrodes; volumetric
                  capacitance was reduced even further because of the

                  This work demonstrates for the first time that a
                  3D-printing technique could sidestep that conundrum,
                  says Yat Li, a professor at UCSC, and coauthor of the
                  paper in the journal Joule that describes the team’s

                  high mass loading of active materials over 180
                  milligrams per square centimeter has been achieved

                  Russian Institute for Biological Medicine launched
                  production of light water, differing from ordinary
                  water by stimulating all human systems' activities
                  through data-flow level. Institute's vice-president
                  claims such developments are unique and cannot be
                  found anywhere else in the world.<br>
                  <br>
                  Natural light water is found in mountain rivers and
                  melting glaciers. Scientists designed rectifying
                  columns for water fractional distillation and derived
                  water free from its heavy components.<br>
                  <br>
                  Light water normalizes any pathology found in an
                  organism. It also improves body resistance to harmful
                  effects of physical, chemical and biological origin.
                  Clinical trials revealed light water's ability to
                  dissolve higher concentrations of various substances
                  and to penetrate membranes easier than ordinary water.
                  Light water showed anti-inflammatory effect and
                  eliminated tissue puffiness.<br>
                  <br>
                  Recently developed "Langway" water is already
                  available at the US market. Tests proved its potential
                  to refine cell metabolic processes through
                  accumulating energy inside a cell. Light water is
                  highly recommended for skin regeneration stimulation.
                  "Langway" tones the skin, reduces its greasiness,
                  narrows skin pores, slows ageing and helps skin to
                  resist negative environmental impact. Light water also
                  regulates excretion of toxins, salts of heavy metals,
                  cellular debris and infectious germs. Another positive
                  aspect is that such water lowers blood sugar and
                  cholesterol, thus it can be recommended for patients,
                  suffering from diabetes, atherosclerosis, obesity and
                  hypertension.<br>

                  produces rejuvenating effect. “ “Langway-IBMED-50”
                  purifies and removes toxic products from body, salts
                  of heavy metals and other harmful substances”, -
                  informed “Interfax” Chief Medical Doctor - Director of
                  the Institute of Biological Medicine (IBMED),
                  Academician Y. Bloshansky. According to him, natural
                  water is one of the factors of our body’s
                  imperceptible poisoning. “It contains heavy isotopes
                  of hydrogen (deuterium) and oxygen in quantities that
                  considerably slow energy processes in cells, harm
                  body’s vitality and damage genic apparatus.” It is
                  caused by its dissociation with terrestrial organisms
                  due to space origin.<br>
                  “Light water that has been purified of heavy isotopes
                  acts on all body cells and results in a healthy glow
                  and skin”, said Y. Bloshansky.<br>
                  The academician is sure that usage of light water with
                  low contents of deuterium can prolong life of every
                  organism both unicellular and multicellular one.<br>

                color="#660000"><font color="#000000">The preoptic area
                  (POA) is necessary for sleep, but the fundamental POA
                  circuits have remained elusive. Previous studies
                  showed that galanin (GAL)- and GABA-producing neurons
                  in the ventrolateral preoptic nucleus (VLPO) express
                  cFos after periods of increased sleep and innervate
                  key wake-promoting regions. Although lesions in this
                  region can produce insomnia, high frequency
                  photostimulation of the POAGAL neurons was shown to
                  paradoxically cause waking, not sleep. Here we report
                  that photostimulation of VLPOGAL neurons in mice
                  promotes sleep with low frequency stimulation
                  (1–4?Hz), but causes conduction block and waking at
                  frequencies above 8?Hz. Further, optogenetic
                  inhibition reduces sleep. Chemogenetic activation of
                  VLPOGAL neurons confirms the increase in sleep, and
                  also reduces body temperature. In addition,
                  chemogenetic activation of VLPOGAL neurons induces
                  short-latency sleep in an animal model of insomnia.
                  Collectively, these findings establish a causal role
                  of VLPOGAL neurons in both sleep induction and heat
                  loss.<br>

                  stabilizes memory traces after initial encoding.
                  Rodent studies suggest that memory consolidation
                  depends on replay of stimulus-specific activity
                  patterns during fast hippocampal “ripple”
                  oscillations. Here, we measured replay in intracranial
                  electroencephalography recordings in human epilepsy
                  patients, and related replay to ripples.
                  Stimulus-specific activity was identified using
                  representational similarity analysis and then tracked
                  during waking rest and sleep after encoding.
                  Stimulus-specific gamma (30–90?Hz) activity during
                  early (100–500?ms) and late (500–1200?ms) encoding is
                  spontaneously reactivated during waking state and
                  sleep, independent of later memory. Ripples during
                  nREM sleep, but not during waking state, trigger
                  replay of activity from the late time window
                  specifically for remembered items. Ripple-triggered
                  replay of activity from the early time window during
                  nREM sleep is enhanced for forgotten items. These
                  results provide the first electrophysiological
                  evidence for replay related to memory consolidation in
                  humans, and point to a prominent role of nREM
                  ripple-triggered replay in consolidation processes.<br>

                    Liverwort could prove to be more medically effective

                color="#660000"><font color="#000000">Researchers have
                  for the first time investigated a substance found in
                  liverwort that resembles THC. The psychoactive
                  substance, which is consumed as a 'legal high,' also
                  exerts analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects, which
                  might be superior to that of THC... <br>
                  <br>
                  A few year ago, Jürg Gertsch from the Institute of
                  Biochemistry and Molecular Medicine at the University
                  of Bern discovered that liverworts were being
                  advertised as so-called "legal highs" on the internet.
                  At the time, nothing was known about the
                  pharmacological effects of this substance. Together
                  with chemists from Erick Carreira's team from the
                  Department of Chemistry at the ETH Zürich, Gertsch's
                  research team in Bern biochemically and
                  pharmacologically compared THC and perrottetinene.<br>
                  <br>
                  Using animal models, they were able to demonstrate
                  that perrottetinene reaches the brain very easily and
                  that, once there, it specifically activates
                  cannabinoid receptors. It even demonstrates a stronger
                  anti-inflammatory effect in the brain than THC,
                  something which makes perrottetinene particularly
                  interesting when you consider its potential medical
                  application "It's astonishing that only two species of
                  plants, separated by 300 million years of evolution,
                  produce psychoactive cannabinoids," says Gertsch. The
                  study was published in the journal Science Advances.<br>

                color="#660000"><font color="#000000">A study of
                  dandelion seeds in motion has revealed a form of
                  flight not seen before, and explains why the plant is
                  among nature's best fliers. <br>
                  <br>
                  When dandelion seeds fly, a ring-shaped air bubble
                  forms as air moves through the bristles, enhancing the
                  drag that slows their descent.<br>
                  <br>
                  The extraordinary flying ability of dandelion seeds is
                  possible thanks to a form of flight that has not been
                  seen before in nature, research has revealed.<br>
                  <br>
                  The discovery, which confirms the common plant among
                  the natural world's best fliers, shows that movement
                  of air around and within its parachute-shaped bundle
                  of bristles enables seeds to travel great distances --
                  often a kilometre or more, kept afloat entirely by
                  wind power.<br>
                  <br>
                  Researchers from the University of Edinburgh carried
                  out experiments to better understand why dandelion
                  seeds fly so well, despite their parachute structure
                  being largely made up of empty space.<br>
                  <br>
                  Their study revealed that a ring-shaped air bubble
                  forms as air moves through the bristles, enhancing the
                  drag that slows each seed's descent to the ground.<br>
                  <br>
                  This newly found form of air bubble -- which the
                  scientists have named the separated vortex ring -- is
                  physically detached from the bristles and is
                  stabilised by air flowing through it.<br>
                  <br>
                  The amount of air flowing through, which is critical
                  for keeping the bubble stable and directly above the
                  seed in flight, is precisely controlled by the spacing
                  of the bristles.<br>
                  <br>
                  This flight mechanism of the bristly parachute
                  underpins the seeds' steady flight. It is four times
                  more efficient than what is possible with conventional
                  parachute design, according to the research.<br>
                  <br>
                  Researchers suggest that the dandelion's porous
                  parachute might inspire the development of small-scale
                  drones that require little or no power consumption.
                  Such drones could be useful for remote sensing or air
                  pollution monitoring.<br>
                  <br>
                  The study, published in Nature, was funded by the
                  Leverhulme Trust and the Royal Society.<br>
                  <br>
                  Dr Cathal Cummins, of the University of Edinburgh's
                  Schools of Biological Sciences and Engineering, who
                  led the study, said: "Taking a closer look at the
                  ingenious structures in nature -- like the dandelion's
                  parachute -- can reveal novel insights. We found a
                  natural solution for flight that minimises the
                  material and energy costs, which can be applied to
                  engineering of sustainable technology."<br>

                  Halloween is just around the corner, and some people
                  will celebrate by watching scary movies about
                  brain-eating zombies. But even more frightening are
                  real-life parasites that feed on the human brain, and
                  they can be harder to kill than their horror-movie
                  counterparts. Now, researchers have developed silver
                  nanoparticles coated with anti-seizure drugs that can
                  kill brain-eating amoebae while sparing human cells.
                  The researchers report their results in ACS Chemical
                  Neuroscience.<br>
                  <br>
                  Although infections with brain-eating amoebae
                  (Naegleria fowleri) are rare, they are almost always
                  deadly. Most cases result from inhaling warm, dirty
                  water in ponds, hot springs or unchlorinated swimming
                  pools. Another species, Acanthamoeba castellanii, can
                  cause blindness by entering the eyes through dirty
                  contact lenses. Common treatments include
                  antimicrobial drugs, but they often cause severe side
                  effects because of the high doses required for them to
                  enter the brain. Ayaz Anwar and colleagues wondered if
                  three anti-seizure drugs — diazepam, phenobarbitone
                  and phenytoin — could kill amoebae, alone or in
                  combination with silver nanoparticles. The drugs are
                  already approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
                  Administration and are known to cross the blood-brain
                  barrier. The researchers reasoned that they might be
                  more effective when attached to silver nanoparticles,
                  which can improve the delivery of some drugs and also
                  have their own antimicrobial effects.<br>
                  <br>
                  The team chemically attached the drugs to silver
                  nanoparticles and examined their ability to kill
                  amoebae. They found that each of the three drugs alone
                  could kill N. fowleri and A. castellanii, but they
                  worked much better when bound to silver nanoparticles.
                  The drug-nanoparticle combos protected human cells
                  from the microbes, increasing their survival rate
                  compared with untreated infected human cells. The
                  researchers propose that these repurposed drugs, aided
                  by the nanoparticles, might kill amoebae by binding to
                  protein receptors or ion channels on the single-celled
                  organism's membrane.<br>

                  system (CNS) infections caused by free-living amoebae
                  such as Acanthamoeba species, Naegleria fowleri etc.
                  are rare but fatal. A major challenge in the treatment
                  against the infections caused by these amoebae is the
                  discovery of novel compounds that can effectively
                  cross the blood-brain barrier to penetrate CNS. It is
                  logical to test clinically-approved drugs against CNS
                  diseases for their potential antiamoebic effects since
                  they are known for effective blood-brain barrier
                  penetration and effect eukaryotic cell targets. The
                  antiamoebic effects of clinically available drugs for
                  seizures targeting gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA)
                  receptor and ion channels were tested against
                  Acanthamoeba castellanii (A. castellanii) belonging to
                  the T4 genotype and Naegleria fowleri (N. fowleri).
                  Three such drugs namely; Diazepam (Valium),
                  Phenobarbitone (Luminal), Phenytoin (Dilantin) and
                  their silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) were evaluated
                  against both trophozoites and cysts stage. Drugs alone
                  and drugs conjugated silver nanoparticles were tested
                  for amoebicidal, cysticidal and host-cells
                  cytotoxicity assays. In vitro amoebicidal assay showed
                  potent amoebicidal effects for Diazepam,
                  Phenobarbitone, and Phenytoin-conjugated AgNPs as
                  compared to drugs alone against A. castellanii and N.
                  fowleri. Nanoparticles were synthesized by sodium
                  borohydride reduction of silver nitrate with drugs as
                  capping agents. Drugs conjugated nanoconjugates were
                  characterized by ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis), and
                  Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopies, and
                  atomic force microscopy (AFM). Furthermore, both drugs
                  and drugs conjugated AgNPs showed compelling
                  cysticidal effects. Drugs conjugations with silver
                  nanoparticles enhanced their antiacanthamoebic
                  activity. Interestingly, amoeba-mediated host cells
                  cytotoxicity was also significantly reduced by drugs
                  alone as well as their nanoconjugates.<b>..</b></font></font></font><b><font
