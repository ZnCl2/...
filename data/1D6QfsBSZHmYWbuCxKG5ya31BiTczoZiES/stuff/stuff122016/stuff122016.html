        <b>Plasma Generator Using Spiral Conductors</b><br>
        <br>
      </div>
      [Inventor] Szatkowski, et al<br>
      <br>
      Abstract: A plasma generator includes a pair of identical spiraled
      electrical conductors separated by dielectric material. Both
      spiraled conductors have inductance and capacitance wherein, in
      the presence of a time-varying electromagnetic field, the spiraled
      conductors resonate to generate a harmonic electromagnetic field
      response. The spiraled conductors lie in parallel planes and
      partially overlap one another in a direction perpendicular to the
      parallel planes. The geometric centers of the spiraled conductors
      define endpoints of a line that is non-perpendicular with respect
      to the parallel planes. A voltage source coupled across the
      spiraled conductors applies a voltage sufficient to generate a
      plasma in at least a portion of the dielectric material. <b><br>

      <b><br>
      </b>Abstract -- A method for generating atmospheric pressure cold
      plasma inside a hand-held unit discharges cold plasma with
      simultaneously different rf wavelengths and their harmonics. The
      unit includes an rf tuning network that is powered by a
      low-voltage power supply connected to a series of high-voltage
      coils and capacitors. The rf energy signal is transferred to a
      primary containment chamber and dispersed through an electrode
      plate network of various sizes and thicknesses to create multiple
      frequencies. Helium gas is introduced into the first primary
      containment chamber, where electron separation is initiated. The
      energized gas flows into a secondary magnetic compression chamber,
      where a balanced frequency network grid with capacitance creates
      the final electron separation, which is inverted magnetically and
      exits through an orifice with a nozzle. The cold plasma thus
      generated has been shown to be capable of accelerating a healing
      process in flesh wounds on animal laboratory specimens.<br>

      <div align="center"><b>In fitting fashion for the 'post truth'
          era, researchers have found that almost fifty percent of

      </div>
      <b><br>
      </b>"Sometimes we blur the lines between speculation and
      imagination — and people are unaware of how easy that can happen
      and how we should be more aware of how fragile our memory is," Dr.
      Kimberley Wade at the University of Warwick's psychology
      department told Sputnik. "Our findings build upon what we already
      know about the malleability of memory — but it also highlights the
      problems with some suggestive questions and techniques." "If you
      ask someone to repeatedly imagine something has happened, or
      distinguish something that they imagined has happened, then people
      often speculate over things that never happened," Dr. Wade told
      Sputnik. The paper, 'A Mega-analysis of Memory Reports from Eight
      Peer-reviewed False Memory Implantation Studies' has been
      published in the journal Memory. A team of researchers including
      Dr. Wade combined data from eight different published studies with
      400 participants to work out how many people come to generate
      false memories. "We found that half of these people came to
      believe than an event happened, but 30 percent went even further
      to describe the memory they had. They even elaborate on it and
      talk about their emotions, so this is the first time we've been
      achieved a better understanding of how these people come to
      believe in something that never happened." The analysis also
      suggested that 23 percent showed signs that they had accepted the
      suggested even to some degree and believed it really happened.<br>
      <br>
      The university of Warwick's findings raise questions about the
      authenticity of memories used in forensic investigations, court
      rooms and in interviews and how collective memories of a large
      group of people could be incorrect — due to misinformation in the
      news.<br>

        ABSTRACT<br>
        <br>
      </b>Understanding that suggestive practices can promote false
      beliefs and false memories for childhood events is important in
      many settings (e.g., psychotherapeutic, medical, and legal). The
      generalisability of findings from memory implantation studies has
      been questioned due to variability in estimates across studies.
      Such variability is partly due to false memories having been
      operationalised differently across studies and to differences in
      memory induction techniques. We explored ways of defining false
      memory based on memory science and developed a reliable coding
      system that we applied to reports from eight published
      implantation studies (N?=?423). Independent raters coded
      transcripts using seven criteria: accepting the suggestion,
      elaboration beyond the suggestion, imagery, coherence, emotion,
      memory statements, and not rejecting the suggestion. Using this
      scheme, 30.4% of cases were classified as false memories and
      another 23% were classified as having accepted the event to some
      degree. When the suggestion included self-relevant information, an
      imagination procedure, and was not accompanied by a photo
      depicting the event, the memory formation rate was 46.1%. Our
      research demonstrates a useful procedure for systematically
      combining data that are not amenable to meta-analysis, and
      provides the most valid estimate of false memory formation and
      associated moderating factors within the implantation literature
      to date.<br>

      </div>
      <b><br>
      </b>In the fall of 1959, General Chapman, Colonel Fry, Major
      Sargent, Major Cripe, and others from NORAD in Colorado Springs,
      attended a meeting at Swannanoa, Virginia (University of Science
      and Philosophy) at the invitation of Walter Russell. At this
      meeting Russell explained the workings of a device he proposed to
      build to take advantage of the vacuum state energy, and the two
      directional movement of energy from gravitation, (generation), to
      radiation, (degeneration). During the following year Russell, his
      wife, Lao, and their assistants built the device. The prototype
      that was built consisted of two sets of dual and
      magnetically-sexed coils. On September 10, 1961, Walter and Lao
      Russell reported to their contacts at NORAD, that the coils had
      worked and that the President of the United States could announce
      to the world that a "greater, safer power than atomic energy"
      could be provided for industry and transportation. After giving
      the device over to the U.S. Government, Dr. Russell refolded a
      year and a half later on May 19, 1963. The Russell Optic
      Dynamo-Generator was never released to the public.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;"This new power and light generator employs a multiplication
      principle of nature which has not yet entered within the realm of
      human consciousness... It is the principle of growth in nature
      which multiplies one kernel of corn into thousands... or
      multiplies the cold of space into hot stars and novas of
      incredibly high temperature... Power multiplication is the most
      conspicuous characteristic of nature. It is amazing to me that it
      has never yet been discovered..." <br>
      <br>
      "We have proven the validity of our concept by making a simple
      small scale working model which is now supplying all the heat,
      light and power needed for our&nbsp; four story 52 room
      University.<b><br>
      </b><br>
      Our reactor generates much more power than needed for whatever
      purpose intended, so enough of that surplus is taken off from its
      generator to motivate the reactor in perpetuity..."<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;Nuclear reactors need whole buildings for operation while
      ours occupies no more space than a furnace or oil heating plant to
      house its reactor, its steam-turbine and its generator. The
      nuclear reactor must be prevented from harming humans by building
      great concrete walls around it, while ours is perfectly harmless
      and occupies so little space that the one which operates at our
      headquarters occupies hardly more than six cubic feet, has no
      moving parts, and weighs not more than four hundred pounds,
      exclusive of its small steam turbine and generator.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; It is needless to say that such a simple, mobile,
      light and power producing machine would not only effect the whole
      world-economy, but would be the first step in bringing abundance
      of the necessities for human existence to every nation on the face
      of this earth."&nbsp; - Walter and Lao Russell<br>

      <b><br>
      </b>A controversial new hypothesis that suggests our understanding
      of gravity is wrong has just passed an important first test.<br>
      <br>
      First proposed back in 2010, the new hypothesis states that
      gravity might behave and arise very differently than Einstein
      predicted, and an independent study of more than 30,000 galaxies
      has now found the first evidence to back this up. <br>
      <br>
      The hypothesis is referred to as 'Verlinde's hypothesis of
      gravity' after the theoretical physicist who came up with it, Erik
      Verlinde from the University of Amsterdam. If it can stand up to
      further testing, it could completely overhaul over a century of
      physics - including getting rid of dark matter altogether.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      Verlinde's approach, on the other hand, says we don't need dark
      matter at all, we just need to rethink gravity.<br>
      <br>
      As we described back in November:<br>
      <br>
      "His suggestion is that gravity isn't a fundamental force of
      nature at all, but rather an emergent phenomenon - just like
      temperature is an emergent phenomenon that arises from the
      movement of microscopic particles.<br>
      <br>
      In other words, gravity is a side effect, not the cause, of what's
      happening in the Universe."<br>

      First test of Verlinde's theory of Emergent Gravity using Weak
      Gravitational Lensing measurements<br>
      Margot M. Brouwer, et al.<br>
      <br>
      Verlinde (2016) proposed that the observed excess gravity in
      galaxies and clusters is the consequence of Emergent Gravity (EG).
      In this theory the standard gravitational laws are modified on
      galactic and larger scales due to the displacement of dark energy
      by baryonic matter. EG gives an estimate of the excess gravity
      (described as an apparent dark matter density) in terms of the
      baryonic mass distribution and the Hubble parameter. In this work
      we present the first test of EG using weak gravitational lensing,
      within the regime of validity of the current model. Although there
      is no direct description of lensing and cosmology in EG yet, we
      can make a reasonable estimate of the expected lensing signal of
      low redshift galaxies by assuming a background LambdaCDM
      cosmology. We measure the (apparent) average surface mass density
      profiles of 33,613 isolated central galaxies, and compare them to
      those predicted by EG based on the galaxies' baryonic masses. To
      this end we employ the ~180 square degrees overlap of the
      Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS) with the spectroscopic Galaxy And Mass
      Assembly (GAMA) survey. We find that the prediction from EG,
      despite requiring no free parameters, is in good agreement with
      the observed galaxy-galaxy lensing profiles in four different
      stellar mass bins. Although this performance is remarkable, this
      study is only a first step. Further advancements on both the
      theoretical framework and observational tests of EG are needed
      before it can be considered a fully developed and solidly tested
      theory. <b><br>

      </b>Stanley Jacobs has been fascinated with ancient Egypt for as
      long as he can recall, but his obsession with one particular
      passage in one particular document started a little over 15 years
      ago. At an annual meeting of Egyptology enthusiasts, he hunted
      down, on the recommendation of a patient, an ancient Egyptian text
      about surgery known as the Edwin Smith Papyrus.<br>
      <br>
      This document is “one of the two most important medical texts from
      ancient Egypt,” according to Egyptologist James Allen, and the
      case studies it contains date back 5,000 years, to the time when
      Egypt’s great pyramids were built. It’s one of the oldest records
      of surgery in the entire world, and when Jacobs first read
      through, he was impressed.<br>
      <br>
      A plastic surgeon himself, he found that most of the cases were
      about “really good reconstruction after traumatic injury, of the
      nose, the neck, the spinal cord,” and that its techniques were
      surprisingly well thought out for a millennia-old book. What
      really intrigued him, though, was a recipe at the back of the
      book, titled “Transforming an Old Man Into a Youth.”<br>
      <br>
      This section of the papyrus is a long and complicated set of
      instructions for making what is, essentially, a face cream. The
      original translator of the papyrus, the Egyptologist James
      Breasted, hadn’t been much impressed by it, writing that the
      recipe “proves to be nothing more than a face paste believed to be
      efficacious in removing wrinkles.”<br>
      <br>
      As a doctor who spends a lot of time thinking about skin, beauty,
      and age, though, Jacobs wasn’t so quick to discount it. “I
      realized that if they’re that serious about their surgical
      treatments, they’re probably serious about this,” he says. <br>

      Jacobs wanted to try this recipe out himself, but when he examined
      the recipe, he ran into a problem. The key ingredient was
      “hemayet-fruit,” and he had no inkling of what that might be...<br>
      <br>
      To Jacobs, the recipe for transforming a man to a youth did seem
      to involve some serious science. The key ingredient, hemayet, is
      subjected to a complicated series of manual and chemical
      procedures—husked, winnowed, sifted, boiled in water, dried,
      washed, ground, and boiled again. As much as a recipe, it looked
      like a set of chemistry instructions.<br>
      <br>
      The first translation of hemayet he found, though, identified it
      as fenugreek, which didn’t make sense to Jacobs. Fenugreek is a
      wispy plant, its seeds easily harvested: it wouldn’t have needed
      to be winnowed and boiled so aggressively. But no one seemed to
      know what else it might be. Jacobs started calling Egyptologist
      after Egyptologist, asking if they knew what this word might mean,
      and no one did. Finally, about eight years after he first became
      curious about the recipe, someone directed him to Allen, who in
      2005 had published a new translation of the papyrus.<br>
      <br>
      Allen had an answer, based on the work of an earlier scholar, more
      experienced than the one who had guessed fenugreek. Hemayet was
      bitter almonds...<br>
      <br>
      But once Jacobs and his colleagues processed the nuts, just as the
      papyrus instructed, they found that all that washing leached the
      poisonous compounds from the almonds. The bitterness leaving,
      Jacobs says, meant the poison was gone, too.<br>
      <br>
      After the transformation, one of the compounds produced from the
      nuts was mandalic acid. For a dermatologist, this compound, a
      known extract of bitter almonds, would already have been
      familiar—starting just a few years before Jacobs got interested in
      the papyrus, dermatologists had started testing it as a treatment
      for acne and other skin problems. For Jacobs, it was a revelation:
      since first discovering the secret of hemayet, he has developed a
      patented formula for mandalic acid-based skin care products and
      written about his quest in a forthcoming book, Nefertiti’s
      Secret...<br>

      <div align="center"><b>Dr. Stanley Jacobs' Ancient Egypt-Inspired
          Skin Care Line Received a Patent in October</b><br>
      </div>
      <b><br>
      </b>After studying the 3,600-year-old Edwin Smith Papyrus, San
      Francisco plastic surgeon Dr. Stanley Jacobs blended modern
      technology with ancient knowledge to revitalize an ancient serum
      for youthful skin<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;Long fascinated by aesthetics, Ancient Egyptian culture, and
      medicine, San Francisco plastic surgeon Dr. Stanley Jacobs
      combined his passions into a singular, eight-year endeavor that
      ultimately resulted in the creation of a unique skin care line and
      securing a patent awarded in October 2016.<br>
      <br>
      The process began when Dr. Jacobs noticed a section titled
      "Transforming an old man into a youth" in the famous Edwin Smith
      Papyrus, a scroll considered to be the world's oldest document
      exploring the subject of surgery. The hieratic script revealed a
      formula for facial rejuvenation, though one ingredient --
      "hemayet" -- proved to be a puzzle. Dr. Jacobs worked with other
      experts to determine that hemayet referred to a substance made
      from bitter almonds, today known as mandelic acid.<br>
      <br>
      This discovery formed the foundation of the Stanley Jacobs MD®
      Skin Care line, anchored by Visco-elastic Transforming Serum and
      further developed to include the Visco-elastic Transforming Creme
      and Transforming Synergy Peel. Dr. Jacobs worked with Jules
      Zecchino, a chemist formerly of Estee Lauder, to create the line.<br>
      <br>
      In November 2013, a patent was filed for a "tritightening skin
      care formulation" comprised of "at least one hydrophilic polymer,
      at least one desquamatory agent and alpha hydroxyl acid." The
      patent -- number 9,474,708 -- was granted on Oct. 25, 2016.<br>
      <br>
      Research and testing included measurements of skin elasticity
      before, during, and after treatments, made by a Cutometer™. This
      vacuum-powered German device pulls up skin and measures how far it
      stretches, then releases it and measures the rate at which it
      returns to its pre-pulled state. Results of clinical trials showed
      that applying the three products to skin yielded a 43 percent
      increase in elasticity.<br>
      <br>
      Improved elasticity reduces lines and wrinkles. Mandelic acid can
      also even out pigmentation and minimize skin breakouts.<br>
      <br>
      In addition to developing this skin care line, the triple board
      certified Dr. Jacobs operates a cosmetic surgery practice with two
      offices -- one in Healdsburg, one in San Francisco -- welcoming
      more than 1,000 patients a year. He developed the SynergyLift™ and
      Dr. Jacobs Serial VectorLift™ for facial surgery, has been
      published for his technique in preventing a pulled lower eyelid in
      blepharoplasty surgery, and is a proponent of the lip lift for
      restoring a look of youth to aging faces.<br>

      care formulation with a tri-tightening complex.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF INVENTION<br>
        <br>
      </b>[0005] In one embodiment, the present invention provides for a

      combination and mixtures thereof.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] In still another embodiment, the alpha hydroxyl acid is
      mandelic acid...<b><br>
        &nbsp; <br>
        DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
        <br>
      </b>[0023] As required, detailed embodiments of the present
      invention are disclosed herein; it is to be understood that the
      disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary of the invention that
      may be embodied in various forms. Therefore, specific structural
      and functional details disclosed herein are not to be interpreted
      as limits, but merely as a basis for teaching one skilled in the
      art to employ the present invention. The specific examples below
      will enable the invention to be better understood. However, they
      are given merely by way of guidance and do not imply any
      limitation.<br>
      <br>
      [0024] In one embodiment, the present invention uses Polyglutamic
      acid (PGA) as the hydrophilic polymer. PGA has been used as a long
      term skin hydrating, plumping material. The material helps bind
      water to the skin, plumping the stratum corneum, adding to skin
      firming and reducing lines and wrinkles.<br>
      <br>
      [0025] These polymers have usually been in the one to two thousand
      Dalton ranges with the maximum molecular weight of 10,000 Daltons.
      Recently, breakthroughs in biotechnology have produced polymers in
      the 2 to 3 million Dalton range. These high molecular weight PGAs
      retain much more water on the skin than the lower molecular weight
      ones. They actually hold more moisture than the Industry standard,
      hyaluronic acids, that have molecular weights in the 2 million
      Dalton range. In addition, a special grade of PGA was employed in
      this invention. A PGA with a molecular weight of about 2 million
      Daltons, that is additionally cross-linked. This cross-linking
      helps render the polymer to be more long lasting on the skin
      surface. It makes it less sensitive to degradation by skin enzymes
      and other agents. The high molecular weight cross-linked PGA
      provides a longer lasting firming and plumping effect than that of
      other PGA's and hyaluronic acid.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] In yet another embodiment, the present invention may use
      Mandelic Acid which is a large molecular weight alpha hydroxy
      acid. Mandelic acid contains an aromatic ring that makes it slow
      to penetrate the upper layers of the stratum corneum. This helps
      to have a much more prolonged effect on the skin than other alpha
      hydroxy acids like glycolic or lactic acids. The skin resurfacing
      action of mandelic acid has numerous benefits: firstly, it has
      been shown to clip off dead surface skin cells, and secondly,
      makes the action of PGA better by giving it a smooth undisturbed
      surface to bind moisture to. Thusly, mandelic acid contributes to
      the skin firming and smoothing benefits of the skin care
      formulations of the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] In still another embodiment, the desquamatory agent may be
      N-acteyl glucosamine (NAG). NAG has shown to give excellent
      results in skin smoothness, firming and reducing lines and
      wrinkles. It acts as a natural skin desquamatory, gently clipping
      off skin surface cells that are remaining on the surface too long.
      There also appears to be a retinoid-like effect of increasing
      collagen synthesis and improving dermal thickening. NAG assist in
      making the skin denser and less lined and wrinkled. The addition
      of NAG to mandelic acid and cross-linked PGA, appears to yield an
      optimum amount of skin firming that is recognizable on test
      subjects in two to four weeks.<br>

      <br>
      The invention belongs to the technical field of water treatment
      and relates to a preparation technique of a banana peel polymer
      coagulant for water treatment. The technique making main use of
      'low-temperature water extraction' at 30-50 DEG C comprises the
      following steps: (1), adding certain water to crushed banana peel
      powder at certain temperature under stirring, and leaching; (2),
      adding little sodium hydroxide solution at certain temperature
      under stirring; (3), selectively adding certain sodium
      hypochlorite and stabilizing agent to obtain coagulant products
      with different effects and stability. The banana peel polymer

      <div align="center"><b>Biomagnetic Pair Webinar introduction </b><br>
      </div>
      <b><br>
        <a href="http://www.biomagnetism.net" ">http://www.biomagnetism.net</a><br>
        <br>
      </b>Medical Biomagnetism, also called Biomagnetic Pair, is a
      natural therapy that proposes diagnosing and treating a large
      number of illnesses through the use of pairs of magnets of medium
      intensity that seek to equalize the organism’s pH level. Dr. Isaac
      Goiz Durán has been claiming since Dr. Broeringmeyer´s death to be
      its discoverer (See below the alternative&nbsp; theory).<br>
      <br>
      According to medical biomagnetism, a large number of illnesses,
      including cancer and many other complex diseases, are associated
      with fundamental alterations in the pH level in the internal
      organs and with the presence of viruses, bacteria, fungus,
      parasites, toxins, and other harmful factors. The development of
      illness cannot happen with a balanced pH level.<br>
      <br>
      This new complementary therapy identifies diseases according to
      their genuine etiology and not just their manifestation (see the
      Article). Once the symptoms or signs of illness have appeared, it
      is also capable of reestablishing the acidic-alkaline balance in
      the organism and restore health, attacking the cause of the
      problem and not just the symptomatology.<br>
      <br>
      The Biomagnetic Pair therapy is different from magnetic therapy
      and magnetic acupuncture, and it adopts a new paradigm. Unlike
      these last two, the Biomagnetic Pair uses pairs of magnets of
      opposite charges to depolarize areas in the body that are
      unbalanced due to pathogens or other factors that resonate
      energetically and vibrationally. It is also different in that it
      has the ability to diagnose the etiology and combat the real cause
      of the disease, especially viruses.<br>
      <br>
      The Biomagnetic Pair is a clean and innocuous system. And still
      more importantly, it is capable of detecting, diagnosing, and
      correcting an abnormal condition even before the symptomatologic
      manifestation. It is, therefore, a preventive therapy, as well as
      healing.<b><br>
        <br>
        The possible true story of the Biomagnetic Pair Therapy genesis<br>
        <br>
      </b>The Biomagnetic Pair Therapy is indeed claimed to have been
      discovered by mexican Dr. Isaac Goiz Durán in 1988. However, there
      are certain indications that would point to Dr. Richard
      Broeringmeyer as to the real discoverer of this therapy. According
      to these new indications, Dr. Goiz would have just been its main
      developer after Dr. Broeringmeyer´s death.<br>
      <br>
      Richard Broeringmeyer was a prominent scientist from Kentucky,
      USA. He was NASA Chief Medical in the 1980s. He had a disciplined,
      meticulous and patient scientific mind. He was the person
      responsible for deciding what astronauts could fly into space or
      not and examining the physiological constants and physical
      condition of the astronauts before going to space and after
      returning.<br>
      <br>
      Dr. Broeringmeyer began to realize in the 80s that astronauts
      returning from space would do so with one of their two legs longer
      than the other one, by the fact of having been exposed to a
      changing magnetic field.<br>
      <br>
      Dr. Broeringmeyer began working methodically with these early
      observations. He discovered how the legs changed in length when
      exposed to magnetic fields applied in certain unbalanced points.
      He was careful and consistent in his writings, his essays were
      rigorous and well written, honoring his prestigious position. And
      so Dr. Broeringmeyer went gradually and painstakingly discovering
      one by one the first 150 Biomagnetic Pairs and developing the
      theory of what is now known as the Biomagnetic Pair Therapy.<br>
      <br>
      Even if Dr. Broeringmeyer had been seriously forbidden and warned
      against talking about his revolutionary new discoveries, he
      nevertheless traveled to Mexico City to deliver a lecture for
      doctors at a large public hospital in Mexico City because he knew
      the importance of his discovery. But unfortunately, he was
      probably being closely watched too.<b><br>
      </b><br>
      Dr. Goiz attended that lecture and showed special interest in the
      topics presented at the conference. For this reason or another, it
      seems that Dr. Broeringmeyer allowed exclusive access to Dr. Goiz
      (only Dr. Goiz knew about it) to all his priceless writings that
      formed the theory of the Biomagnetic Pair therapy so that they
      could be kept in custody just in case “something” happened to him.<br>
      <br>
      And indeed, very shortly after that lecture, Dr. Richard
      Broeringmeyer surprinsingly died in strange circumstances. Very
      little is known nowadays about Dr. Richard Broeringmeyer´s life
      and work, which is not consistent with the important position that
      he held for years.<br>
      <br>
      Therefore, according to this theory, Dr. Goiz would have taken
      advantage of the big and revolutionary work of Dr. Broeringmeyer
      and would have just developed it further, especially in terms of
      discovering new pairs.<br>

        Bioinspired morphing wings for extended flight envelope and roll
        control of small drones<br>

      </b>Abstract<br>
      Small-winged drones can face highly varied aerodynamic
      requirements, such as high manoeuvrability for flight among
      obstacles and high wind resistance for constant ground speed
      against strong headwinds that cannot all be optimally addressed by
      a single aerodynamic profile. Several bird species solve this
      problem by changing the shape of their wings to adapt to the
      different aerodynamic requirements. Here, we describe a novel
      morphing wing design composed of artificial feathers that can
      rapidly modify its geometry to fulfil different aerodynamic
      requirements. We show that a fully deployed configuration enhances
      manoeuvrability while a folded configuration offers low drag at
      high speeds and is beneficial in strong headwinds. We also show
      that asymmetric folding of the wings can be used for roll control
      of the drone. The aerodynamic performance of the morphing wing is
      characterized in simulations, in wind tunnel measurements and
      validated in outdoor flights with a small drone.<b><br>

        The influence of aspect ratio and stroke pattern on force
        generation of a bat-inspired membrane wing<br>

        Abstract<br>
      </b>Aspect ratio (AR) is one parameter used to predict the flight
      performance of a bat species based on wing shape. Bats with high
      AR wings are thought to have superior lift-to-drag ratios and are
      therefore predicted to be able to fly faster or to sustain longer
      flights. By contrast, bats with lower AR wings are usually thought
      to exhibit higher manoeuvrability. However, the half-span ARs of
      most bat wings fall into a narrow range of about 2.5–4.5.
      Furthermore, these predictions do not take into account the wide
      variation in flapping motion observed in bats. To examine the
      influence of different stroke patterns, we measured lift and drag
      of highly compliant membrane wings with different bat-relevant
      ARs. A two degrees of freedom shoulder joint allowed for
      independent control of flapping amplitude and wing sweep. We
      tested five models with the same variations of stroke patterns,
      flapping frequencies and wind speed velocities. Our results
      suggest that within the relatively small AR range of bat wings, AR
      has no clear effect on force generation. Instead, the generation
      of lift by our simple model mostly depends on wingbeat frequency,
      flapping amplitude and freestream velocity; drag is mostly
      affected by the flapping amplitude.<b><br>

        Petiolate wings: effects on the leading-edge vortex in flapping

          Abstract</a><br>
        <br>
      </b>The wings of many insect species including crane flies and
      damselflies are petiolate (on stalks), with the wing planform
      beginning some distance away from the wing hinge, rather than at
      the hinge. The aerodynamic impact of flapping petiolate wings is
      relatively unknown, particularly on the formation of the
      lift-augmenting leading-edge vortex (LEV): a key flow structure
      exploited by many insects, birds and bats to enhance their lift
      coefficient. We investigated the aerodynamic implications of
      petiolation P using particle image velocimetry flow field
      measurements on an array of rectangular wings of aspect ratio 3
      and petiolation values of P = 1–3. The wings were driven using a
      mechanical device, the ‘Flapperatus’, to produce highly repeatable
      insect-like kinematics. The wings maintained a constant Reynolds
      number of 1400 and dimensionless stroke amplitude Λ* (number of
      chords traversed by the wingtip) of 6.5 across all test cases. Our
      results showed that for more petiolate wings the LEV is generally
      larger, stronger in circulation, and covers a greater area of the
      wing surface, particularly at the mid-span and inboard locations
      early in the wing stroke cycle. In each case, the LEV was
      initially arch-like in form with its outboard end terminating in a
      focus-sink on the wing surface, before transitioning to become
      continuous with the tip vortex thereafter. In the second half of
      the wing stroke, more petiolate wings exhibit a more detached LEV,
      with detachment initiating at approximately 70% and 50% span for P
      = 1 and 3, respectively. As a consequence, lift coefficients based
      on the LEV are higher in the first half of the wing stroke for
      petiolate wings, but more comparable in the second half.
      Time-averaged LEV lift coefficients show a general rise with
      petiolation over the range tested.<b><br>

        Andrew G Sharpe, Timothy R Hughes and Jonathan E Page<br>
        <br>
        Abstract<br>
        Background<br>
        <br>
      </b>Cannabis sativa has been cultivated throughout human history
      as a source of fiber, oil and food, and for its medicinal and
      intoxicating properties. Selective breeding has produced cannabis
      plants for specific uses, including high-potency marijuana strains
      and hemp cultivars for fiber and seed production. The molecular
      biology underlying cannabinoid biosynthesis and other traits of
      interest is largely unexplored.<br>
      <b><br>
        Results<br>
        <br>
      </b>We sequenced genomic DNA and RNA from the marijuana strain
      Purple Kush using shortread approaches. We report a draft haploid
      genome sequence of 534 Mb and a transcriptome of 30,000 genes.
      Comparison of the transcriptome of Purple Kush with that of the
      hemp cultivar 'Finola' revealed that many genes encoding proteins
      involved in cannabinoid and precursor pathways are more highly
      expressed in Purple Kush than in 'Finola'. The exclusive
      occurrence of Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinolic acid synthase in the
      Purple Kush transcriptome, and its replacement by cannabidiolic
      acid synthase in 'Finola', may explain why the psychoactive
      cannabinoid Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is produced in marijuana
      but not in hemp. Resequencing the hemp cultivars 'Finola' and
      'USO-31' showed little difference in gene copy numbers of
      cannabinoid pathway enzymes. However, single nucleotide variant
      analysis uncovered a relatively high level of variation among four
      cannabis types, and supported a separation of marijuana and hemp.<br>
      <b><br>
        Conclusions<br>
        <br>
      </b>The availability of the Cannabis sativa genome enables the
      study of a multifunctional plant that occupies a unique role in
      human culture. Its availability will aid the development of
      therapeutic marijuana strains with tailored cannabinoid profiles
      and provide a basis for the breeding of hemp with improved
      agronomic characteristics.<b><br>

      <b><br>
        Summary:<br>
        <br>
      </b>Sounds, such as music and noise, are capable of reliably
      affecting individuals' moods and emotions, possibly by regulating
      brain dopamine, a neurotransmitter strongly involved in emotional
      behavior and mood regulation. However, the relationship of sound

        How to reactivate forgotten memories<br>
        <br>
      </b>Sophisticated techniques can decode stimulus representations
      for items held in a person's working memory. However, when
      subjects shift their attention toward something else, the neural
      representation of the now unattended item drops to baseline, as
      though the item has been forgotten. Rose et al. used single-pulse
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to briefly reactivate the
      representation of an unattended item. A short pulse of TMS
      enhanced recognition of “forgotten” stimuli, bringing an
      unattended item back into focal attention.<b><br>
        <br>
        Abstract<br>
        <br>
      </b>The ability to hold information in working memory is
      fundamental for cognition. Contrary to the long-standing view that
      working memory depends on sustained, elevated activity, we present
      evidence suggesting that humans can hold information in working
      memory via “activity-silent” synaptic mechanisms. Using
      multivariate pattern analyses to decode brain activity patterns,
      we found that the active representation of an item in working
      memory drops to baseline when attention shifts away. A targeted
      pulse of transcranial magnetic stimulation produced a brief
      reemergence of the item in concurrently measured brain activity.
      This reactivation effect occurred and influenced memory
      performance only when the item was potentially relevant later in
      the trial, which suggests that the representation is dynamic and
      modifiable via cognitive control. The results support a synaptic
      theory of working memory.<b><br>

      </div>
      <b><br>
      </b>The human brain can hold 10 times more memories than
      previously believed, according to a new study. The key to its
      amazing ability lies in synapses, the neural connections
      responsible for storing memories.<br>
      <br>
      Researchers from the Salk Institute found that each synapse can
      hold about 4.7 bits of information. This means that the human
      brain has a capacity of one petabyte, or 1,000,000,000,000,000
      bytes. This is equivalent to approximately 20 million four-drawer
      filing cabinets filled with text.<br>
      <br>
      "This is a real bombshell in the field of neuroscience...our new
      measurements of the brain's memory capacity increase conservative
      estimates by a factor of 10 to at least a petabyte, in the same

        Abstract<br>
        <br>
      </b>Information in a computer is quantified by the number of bits
      that can be stored and recovered. An important question about the
      brain is how much information can be stored at a synapse through
      synaptic plasticity, which depends on the history of probabilistic
      synaptic activity. The strong correlation between size and
      efficacy of a synapse allowed us to estimate the variability of
      synaptic plasticity. In an EM reconstruction of hippocampal
      neuropil we found single axons making two or more synaptic
      contacts onto the same dendrites, having shared histories of
      presynaptic and postsynaptic activity. The spine heads and neck
      diameters, but not neck lengths, of these pairs were nearly
      identical in size. We found that there is a minimum of 26
      distinguishable synaptic strengths, corresponding to storing 4.7
      bits of information at each synapse. Because of stochastic
      variability of synaptic activation the observed precision requires
      averaging activity over several minutes.<b><br>

      </div>
      <b><br>
      </b>...Researchers have created an artificial red blood cell that
      effectively picks up oxygen in the lungs and delivers it to
      tissues throughout the body...<br>
      <br>
      The artificial blood cell, which is about one-fiftieth the size of
      a normal red blood cell, is made from purified human hemoglobin
      proteins that have been coated with a synthetic polymer, Doctor
      said. Hemoglobin is the component inside red blood cells that
      carries oxygen throughout the body...<br>
      <br>
      The synthetic polymer coating of the latest artificial blood cell
      appears to solve both these problems, Doctor explained. The
      coating was developed by the study’s lead researcher, Dipanjan
      Pan, an assistant professor of bioengineering with the University
      of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign...<br>
      <br>
      The polymer coating also keeps the hemoglobin from reacting with
      nitric oxide in the bloodstream, thus preventing dangerous
      constriction of the blood vessels, he added.<br>
      <br>
      There’s also one more benefit -- because the polymer coating is
      “immune silent,” the artificial blood can be used in anyone
      regardless of blood type, Doctor said...<br>
      <br>
      However, the artificial red blood cells will never totally replace
      the real thing, Doctor said.<br>
      <br>
      For one thing, they can’t remain in the bloodstream anywhere near
      as long as regular red blood cells.<br>
      <br>
      “A normal red blood cell circulates about 120 days. This cell
      right now, we project circulation for about a third of a day to
      half a day,” Doctor said. “We may be able to manipulate that and
      get it up to a couple of days, but I seriously doubt we’ll be able
      to get to the circulation time of a normal red blood cell.”<br>
      <br>
      The artificial cell also is designed solely to deliver oxygen, and
      leaves out a number of other functions that red blood cells
      provide...<br>

        <br>
      </b>The present disclosure provides oxygen-carrying nanoparticles,
      methods of making the nanoparticles, and methods of using the
      nanoparticles to carry oxygen in blood.<b><br>
        <br>
        BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
        <br>
      </b>[0003] Blood transfusions are life-saving procedures used in
      medical conditions and emergencies to replace lost components of
      the blood. According to the American Red Cross, someone in the
      U.S. needs blood every two seconds, more than 44,000 blood
      donations are needed every day, and a total of 30 million blood
      components are transfused each year in the U.S. A single car
      accident victim can require as many as 100 pints of blood. In
      addition, patients with diseases such as sickle cell anemia and
      cancer affect millions of people in the U.S., and patients with
      these diseases can require frequent blood transfusions throughout
      their lives. Major worldwide blood shortages, infected donated
      blood, the necessity for blood typing, a short shelf life of
      stored blood, and the inadequacy of stored blood for use in
      certain situations such as battlefield scenarios and trauma, have
      led scientists to synthesize and test blood substitute products.
      Although non-blood volume expanders for cases where only volume
      restoration is required are widely available, to date there is no
      well accepted oxygen-carrying blood substitutes. Perfluorocarbon
      based oxygen-carrying products rely on dissolved oxygen, dissolve
      3 times more in oxygen than red blood cells, and have a long shelf
      life. However, PFC-based products have failed due to poor oxygen
      delivery functionality, short half-life in circulation, complement
      activation by pluronic surfactants in PFC-based products, and
      require cold storage at freezing temperatures. On the other hand,
      currently available hemoglobin based oxygen carriers (HBOCs) have
      a short period of functionality during circulation, have poor
      oxygen capture and release dynamics, and are incompatible with dry
      storage, limiting their use in remote areas. In addition,
      hemoglobin based oxygen carriers have been shown to be unsafe,
      causing hemodynamic and gastrointestinal perturbations related to
      nitric oxide (NO) scavenging, free radical induction, and
      alteration of biochemical and hematological parameters such as
      increased liver enzyme levels and platelet aggregation.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] Therefore, there is a need for a safe and efficient
      oxygen-carrying blood substitute having adequate oxygen capture
      and release dynamics that does not interfere with normal
      regulation of blood vessel caliber, is capable of maintaining
      oxygen-carrying functionality during circulation, and is amenable
      to extended storage and ease of use.<b><br>
        <br>
        SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
        <br>
      </b>[0005] Accordingly, in one aspect, the present disclosure
      provides an oxygen-carrying nanoparticle. The nanoparticle has a
      substantially bi-concaved disc shape, comprises an aqueous core
      and a shell comprising an amphiphilic polymer. The nanoparticle
      also comprises an oxygen-carrying agent, an allosteric effector,
      and a reducing agent. The amphiphilic polymer may comprise a
      branched polymer conjugated to a lipid. The surface of the
      amphiphilic polymer comprising the outer layer of the shell may be
      derivatized with polyethylene glycol. The average diameter of the
      nanoparticle may be from about 150 nm to about 300 nm, and the
      average height of the nanoparticle is from about 30 nm to about 80
      nm. The nanoparticle may comprise a through-hole or a depression.
      The amphiphilic polymer may comprise polyethyleneimine conjugated
      to C24-pentacosadiynoic acid. The amphiphilic polymer may also
      comprise polyethyleneimine conjugated to palmitic acid. The
      oxygen-carrying agent may be hemoglobin. The allosteric effector
      may be 2,3-DPG. The reducing agent may be leucomethylene blue. The
      nanoparticle may comprise about 20% to about 60% (w/v) hemoglobin.
      The nanoparticle may be lyophilizeable and stored for extended
      periods at ambient conditions. The lyophilized nanoparticles may
      be reconstituted in an aqueous buffer at various concentrations
      prior to administration. The nanoparticle may not substantially
      sequester nitric oxide. The nanoparticle may limit the oxidation
      of hemoglobin to about 10% or less of the total concentration of
      hemoglobin in the nanoparticle...<br>

      <b><br>
      </b>Northwestern Medicine scientists have discovered for the first
      time that the rhythm of breathing creates electrical activity in
      the human brain that enhances emotional judgments and memory
      recall.<br>
      <br>
      These effects on behavior depend critically on whether you inhale
      or exhale and whether you breathe through the nose or mouth.<br>
      <br>
      In the study, individuals were able to identify a fearful face
      more quickly if they encountered the face when breathing in
      compared to breathing out. Individuals also were more likely to
      remember an object if they encountered it on the inhaled breath
      than the exhaled one. The effect disappeared if breathing was
      through the mouth.<br>
      <br>
      “One of the major findings in this study is that there is a
      dramatic difference in brain activity in the amygdala and
      hippocampus during inhalation compared with exhalation,” said lead
      author Christina Zelano, assistant professor of neurology at
      Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. “When you
      breathe in, we discovered you are stimulating neurons in the
      olfactory cortex, amygdala and hippocampus, all across the limbic
      system.”<br>
      <br>
      The study was published Dec. 6 in the Journal of Neuroscience. <br>
      <br>
      The senior author is Jay Gottfried, professor of neurology at
      Feinberg.<b><br>
      </b><br>
      Northwestern scientists first discovered these differences in
      brain activity while studying seven patients with epilepsy who
      were scheduled for brain surgery. A week prior to surgery, a
      surgeon implanted electrodes into the patients’ brains in order to
      identify the origin of their seizures. This allowed scientists to
      acquire electro-physiological data directly from their brains. The
      recorded electrical signals showed brain activity fluctuated with
      breathing. The activity occurs in brain areas where emotions,
      memory and smells are processed.<b><br>
        <br>
        Nose Mouth Time<br>
        <br>
      </b>This discovery led scientists to ask whether cognitive
      functions typically associated with these brain areas — in
      particular fear processing and memory — could also be affected by
      breathing.<br>
      <br>
      The amygdala is strongly linked to emotional processing, in
      particular fear-related emotions. So scientists asked about 60
      subjects to make rapid decisions on emotional expressions in the
      lab environment while recording their breathing. Presented with
      pictures of faces showing expressions of either fear or surprise,
      the subjects had to indicate, as quickly as they could, which
      emotion each face was expressing.<br>
      <br>
      When faces were encountered during inhalation, subjects recognized
      them as fearful more quickly than when faces were encountered
      during exhalation. This was not true for faces expressing
      surprise. These effects diminished when subjects performed the
      same task while breathing through their mouths. Thus the effect
      was specific to fearful stimuli during nasal breathing only.<br>
      <br>
      In an experiment aimed at assessing memory function — tied to the
      hippocampus — the same subjects were shown pictures of objects on
      a computer screen and told to remember them. Later, they were
      asked to recall those objects. Researchers found that recall was
      better if the images were encountered during inhalation.<br>
      <br>
      The findings imply that rapid breathing may confer an advantage
      when someone is in a dangerous situation, Zelano said.<br>
      <br>
      “If you are in a panic state, your breathing rhythm becomes
      faster,” Zelano said. “As a result you’ll spend proportionally
      more time inhaling than when in a calm state. Thus, our body’s
      innate response to fear with faster breathing could have a
      positive impact on brain function and result in faster response
      times to dangerous stimuli in the environment.”<b><br>
      </b><br>
      Another potential insight of the research is on the basic
      mechanisms of meditation or focused breathing. “When you inhale,
      you are in a sense synchronizing brain oscillations across the
      limbic network,” Zelano noted.<br>

      <b><br>
      </b>A new study, led by Professor Jae Sung Son of Materials
      Science and Engineering at UNIST has succeeded in developing a new
      technique that can be used to turn industrial waste heat into
      electricity for vehicles and other applications.<br>
      <br>
      In their study, the team presented a new type of high-performance
      thermoelectric (TE) materials that possess liquid-like properties.
      These newly developed materials are both shape-engineerable and
      geometrically compatible in that they can be directly
      brush-painted on almost any surface.<br>
      <br>
      Scientists hope that their findings, described in the journal
      Nature Communications this week, will pave the way to designing
      materials and devices that can be easily transferred to other
      applications.<br>
      <br>
      The thermoelectric effect is the direct conversion of temperature
      differences to electric voltage and vice versa. This effect can be
      used either for heating or for cooling, such as in small cooling
      systems, automotive cooling systems, as well as waste heat
      recovery system for ships. In addition, the thermoelectric
      generator modules used in these devices are configured as
      rectangular parallelepipeds.<br>
      <br>
      The output power of thermoelectric generators depends on device
      engineering minimizing heat loss, as well as inherent material
      properties. According to the research team, the currently existing
      liquid-like TE materials have been largely neglected due to the
      limited flat or angular shape of devices.<br>
      <b><br>
      </b>However, considering that the surface of most heat sources
      where these planar devices are attached is curved, a considerable
      amount of heat loss is inevitable. To address this issue, the
      research team presented the shape-engineerable thermoelectric
      painting technique where they they directly brush TE paints onto
      the surface of heat sources to produce electricity.<br>
      <br>
      Using this technique, one can now easily achive electricity via
      the application of TE paints on the exterior surfaces of
      buildings, roofs, and cars. Scientists hope that their findings
      will pave the way to designing materials and devices that can be
      easily transferred to other applications.<br>
      <br>
      To show the feasibility of the currently proposed technology, they
      also fabricated TE generators through painting TE paints on flat,
      curved and large-sized hemispherical substrates, demonstrating
      that it is the most effective means of heat energy collection from
      any heat sources with exceedingly high output power density of
      4.0?mW?cm?2, which is the best value among the reported printed TE
      generators.<br>
      <br>
      "By developing integral thermoelectric modules through painting
      process, we have overcome limitations of flat thermoelectric
      modules and are able to collect heat energy more efficiently."
      said Professor Son. "Thermoelectric generation systems can be
      developed as whatever types user want and cost from manufacturing
      systems can also be greatly reduced by conserving materials and
      simplifying processes.."<br>
      <br>
      "Our thermoelectric material can be applied any heat source
      regardless of its shape, type and size." said Professor Son. "It
      will place itself as a new type of new and renewable energy
      generating system."<b><br>

      the shape-engineerable thermoelectric painting, geometrically
      compatible to surfaces of any shape. We prepared Bi2Te3-based
      inorganic paints using the molecular Sb2Te3 chalcogenidometalate
      as a sintering aid for thermoelectric particles, with ZT values of
      0.67 for n-type and 1.21 for p-type painted materials that compete
      the bulk values. Devices directly brush-painted onto curved
      surfaces produced the high output power of 4.0?mW?cm-2. This
      approach paves the way to designing materials and devices that can

      website, www.wallstreetonparade.com, have researched PropOrNot to
      identify the corrupt forces that intend to make it a crime to
      speak truthfully in America.<br>
      <br>
      It wasn’t easy to find out as those responsible for the website
      are hidden behind multiple covers like offshore tax avoidance
      corporations. But this is what they found out:<br>
      <br>
      PropOrNot has an agent address in Sante Fe, New Mexico. An agent
      address serves “as a virtual address for the creation of limited
      liability corporations that want to keep their actual principals
      secret. The address has dozens of businesses associated with it.
      There should also be a corresponding business listed in the online
      archives of the business registry at the Secretary of State of New
      Mexico. However, no business with the words Propaganda or
      PropOrNot or YYY exist in the New Mexico business registry,
      suggesting PropOrNot is using a double cloaking device to shield
      its identity by registering under a completely different name.”<br>
      <br>
      Obviously, those behind PropOrNot are either so ashamed of their
      perfidy or they are such public names that they want to stay
      hidden so that the American public cannot know who is determined
      to replace truth with lie.<br>
      <br>
      And public names it is. The Martens find PropOrNot background ties
      to the billionaire Koch brothers, to the Lynde and Harry Bradley
      Foundation, to the Sarah Scaife Foundation (the Mellon fortune),
      ExxonMobil, US Senators Chris Murphy and Rob Portman, who tie into
      Citigroup and Goldman Sachs, “two Wall Street behemoths that would
      very much like to pivot the national debate to anything other than
      Wall Street power and corruption.”<br>

      </b>The present investigation details the development of model
      systems for growing two- and threedimensional human neural
      progenitor cells within a culture medium facilitated by a
      time-varying electromagnetic field (TVEMF). The cells and culture
      medium are contained within a two- or three-dimensional culture
      vessel, and the electromagnetic field is emitted from an electrode
      or coil.<br>
      <br>
      These studies further provide methods to promote neural tissue
      regeneration by means of culturing the neural cells in either
      configuration. Grown in two dimensions, neuronal cells extended
      longitudinally, forming tissue strands extending axially along and
      within electrodes comprising electrically conductive channels or
      guides through which a time-varying electrical current was
      conducted.<br>
      <br>
      In the three-dimensional aspect, exposure to TVEMF resulted in the
      development of three-dimensional aggregates, which emulated
      organized neural tissues. In both experimental configurations, the
      proliferation rate of the TVEMF cells was 2.5 to 4.0 times the
      rate of the non-waveform cells...<br>
      <br>
      Each of the experimental embodiments resulted in similar molecular
      genetic changes regarding the growth potential of the tissues as
      measured by gene chip analyses, which measured more than 10,000
      human genes simultaneously. <br>

        <br>
      </b>This is a special Ultrasonic Piezo Transducer. It's special
      because 42.8 kHz is claimed by many sources, starting with John
      Keely, as well as Bob Boyce, to be the frequency to dissociate
      water. I.e. to break the molecular bonds and so possibly use less
      energy to split apart the water, than the energy it produces when
      water is created.<br>
      <br>
      Another famous experiment claimed to shoot a column of water in
      which there was produced a standing wave from 42.8kHz transducer,
      straight up through the roof, making a clean hole in the ceiling.
      We haven't verified these claims, and sell these rare transducers
      for people who want to experiment with this famous frequency.<br>
      <br>
      These transducers are 40mm (1.6") in diameter, and are resonant at
      42.8kHz, but will handle about 41.8kHz to 43.8kHz at somewhat
      reduced power. Sale includes ONE piece, although the picture shows
      two. We only have a few of these.<br>
      <br>
      Here's a quote and a link. Or you can google '42.8khz water':<b><br>
        <br>
      </b>"Dr. X took periodic readings of his instrumentation and was
      assured that the standing wave was being maintained. Suddenly,
      with no warning whatever the water disappeared from the open
      quartz tube. He looked up thinking to see the water splashed on
      the ceiling when to his amazement a clean hole went right through
      the ceiling. The hole was the same size as the inside of the
      quartz tube."<br>
      <br>
      And make sure it's epoxied or bolted to a vessel filled with water
      before powering it. If the vessel is empty or transducer is not
      attached to anything, it can shatter upon powering it.<b><br>

      </div>
      <b><br>
      </b>This video contains some mind-boggling information, it will
      change the way you perceive the world around you, the way you
      think about yourself and your life.<br>
      <br>
      In this video you will learn about professor Peter Garyaev and his
      groundbreaking theory of wave genetics. Basically, professor Peter
      Garyaev has the keys to your immortality. Wave genetics enables us
      to find cures for all kinds of diseases and conditions, to
      regenerate organs and to make us generally healthier and to help
      us live longer and better.<br>
      <br>
      And Peter Garyaev has proven that he is capable of doing magical
      stuff. In one of his dazzling wave genetics experiments he induced
      a complete recovery of the pancreases of laboratory rats.<br>
      The core basis of the treatment based on wave genetics is to
      expose you to the waves of encoded information. Professor Peter
      Garyaev uses biological quantum computers to transcribe your
      genetic information, the data contained in your DNA. Then, this
      information is encoded into sound waves and recorded on a DVD. You
      listen to this DVD once in a while, and when you do, it affects
      you — it makes you immortal.<br>
      <br>
      The unique sound of your DNA will cure all of your diseases, will
      help you regenerate your organs and will help you avoid the
      process of getting older, the process of aging.<b><br>

          War!</b><br>
      </div>
      <b><br>
      </b>As per usual, the 'authorities', that is to say the
      'establishment', the 'ruling elite and their minions' have been
      lying to you.<br>
      <br>
      Your lying schooling called it The American Civil War (of the
      1860s).<br>
      <br>
      It was not.<br>
      <br>
      A civil war is a fight among the population. That was a war
      between factions of the ruling elite played out on the
      battlefields of the American South using the American people as
      their pawns. As in all the wars of the elites, banks were the
      beneficiaries, and the people paid the costs in their blood and
      dying.<br>
      You are living in the First American Civil War!<br>
      <br>
      This is the first real American Civil War. There are two parts of
      USAPop who are fighting it out in the midst of the great mass of
      the unaware, sleeping population. Both warring groups are small,
      and are fighting through, with, and over the larger mass of the
      population.<br>
      The sleeping population does not see the war.<br>
      <br>
      The current battlefields may be the internet, and within the
      'media wars', but this is a real war, with real deaths, missing
      people, and destroyed infrastructure. This is a true war, one that
      must be won at all costs, for the side that started it all, the
      'Establishment', aka, the 'ruling elites'.<br>
      <br>
      You see, this is not a 'civil war' as you have had described in
      the past where the power elites divided the population and set
      them at each others' throats for the amusement and profit of the
      banksters.<br>
      <br>
      Instead of a battlefield on earth, we are fighting a war of minds.
      On the one side are the power elites surrounded by their slavish
      minions all shouting at the top of their lungs their 'divine right
      to rule'. Their primary weapon, the broadcast media, is old,
      tired, and failing. The spell of broadcast media has faded,
      lasting only a few generations as the minds of humans learned to
      adapt, and overcome. It does not work on the young any more, and
      the old that had been captured are dying off, daily reducing the
      power of the legacy media.<br>
      <br>
      Standing in opposition is the new media.<br>
      <br>
      Unlike previous wars for the power elites, there is no central
      enemy to fight. Yes, they are killing off the new media as it
      arises, but unlike battles between elites, when you kill off a
      member of the alt-media, it does not end the war.<br>
      <br>
      It does not work to kill off the new media personalities.<br>
      <br>
      It actually makes it worse for the elites to kill the alt-media as
      it creates martyrs, and encourages yet more sleeping population to
      awaken, to discover themselves as either fodder for the elites, or
      warriors against them.<br>
      <br>
      Not a good situation for the ruling 'elites'.<br>
      <br>
      In previous wars, the population was always looking horizontally
      across at another poor bastard human as the enemy. Now the gaze is
      'upward', toward the real enemy, the ruling elites where we find
      them hiding behind men in skirts (religion), men in uniforms
      (military), men in suits (lawyers, banksters), and men in white
      coats (psychiatrists, doctors) all proclaiming “I am in charge! I
      am your authority! Those politicians are NOT pedophiles and
      worse!”. Of course, these are all the minions, not the elites
      themselves that you will see.<br>
      <br>
      The 'elites' don't like exposing their saggy old skin to any
      risks.<br>
      <br>
      In fact, they are freaking out over their rising exposure. It has
      dawned on the smarter ones of the elites that they risk losing.
      Really losing...as in real change, not merely shifting
      personalities around in the boardroom, but actually having the
      building torn down around them. This has them very scared. They
      will be increasingly dangerous.<br>
      <br>
      They will send their mind-controlled slaves against you.<br>
      <br>
      These slaves are your cousins, brothers, sisters, and parents.
      These slaves are the only power that the elite have. They are too
      much cowards to fight, instead they send their minions to direct
      the slaves against you. Even their minions who identify so
      strongly with the elites, worshiping them, are like their masters,
      cowards, and mostly will not face you in this war. They will send
      the mind-slaves of the broadcast media to fight you.<br>
      <br>
      In this war, your goal is not to kill.<br>
      <br>
      That is why you will win.<br>
      <br>
      Your goal is to take the human used as a weapon against you, and
      to turn it around. That is all you need to do to win, just turn
      each human they send to do you harm back toward the ruling elites.
      You do this by stripping away the mask placed on reality by the
      minions of the broadcast media. Take their weapon as your
      friend....you win, they lose.<br>
      <br>
      Not that it will be easy.<br>
      <br>
      As with all wars, we face yet years of struggle, hardship,
      suffering, death, wounding, and loss. The elites, the enemies of
      USAPop, are evil and desperate. Deep down they already know they
      have lost. That thought now percolates closer to their
      consciousness driving them to even more extreme acts.<br>
      <br>
      Be cautious, human, for your enemies are desperate, mad, and
      stupid!<br>
      <br>

        <b>Concerning Criticism of the Warren Report</b><br>
      </div>
      <b><br>
      </b>1. Our Concern. From the day of President Kennedy's
      assassination on, there has been speculation about the
      responsibility for his murder. Although this was stemmed for a
      time by the Warren Commission report, (which appeared at the end
      of September 1964), various writers have now had time to scan the
      Commission's published report and documents for new pretexts for
      questioning, and there has been a new wave of books and articles
      criticizing the Commission's findings. In most cases the critics
      have speculated as to the existence of some kind of conspiracy,
      and often they have implied that the Commission itself was
      involved. Presumably as a result of the increasing challenge to
      the Warren Commission's report, a public opinion poll recently
      indicated that 46% of the American public did not think that
      Oswald acted alone, while more than half of those polled thought
      that the Commission had left some questions unresolved. Doubtless
      polls abroad would show similar, or possibly more adverse results.<br>
      <br>
      2. This trend of opinion is a matter of concern to the U.S.
      government, including our organization. The members of the Warren
      Commission were naturally chosen for their integrity, experience
      and prominence. They represented both major parties, and they and
      their staff were deliberately drawn from all sections of the
      country. Just because of the standing of the Commissioners,
      efforts to impugn their rectitude and wisdom tend to cast doubt on
      the whole leadership of American society. Moreover, there seems to
      be an increasing tendency to hint that President Johnson himself,
      as the one person who might be said to have benefited, was in some
      way responsible for the assassination.<br>
      <br>
      Innuendo of such seriousness affects not only the individual
      concerned, but also the whole reputation of the American
      government. Our organization itself is directly involved: among
      other facts, we contributed information to the investigation.
      Conspiracy theories have frequently thrown suspicion on our
      organization, for example by falsely alleging that Lee Harvey
      Oswald worked for us. The aim of this dispatch is to provide
      material countering and discrediting the claims of the conspiracy
      theorists, so as to inhibit the circulation of such claims in
      other countries. Background information is supplied in a
      classified section and in a number of unclassified attachments.<br>
      <br>
      3. Action. We do not recommend that discussion of the
      assassination question be initiated where it is not already taking
      place. Where discussion is active [business] addresses are
      requested:<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. To discuss the publicity problem with [?]
      and friendly elite contacts (especially politicians and editors),
      pointing out that the Warren Commission made as thorough an
      investigation as humanly possible, that the charges of the critics
      are without serious foundation, and that further speculative
      discussion only plays into the hands of the opposition. Point out
      also that parts of the conspiracy talk appear to be deliberately
      generated by Communist propagandists. Urge them to use their
      influence to discourage unfounded and irresponsible speculation.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. To employ propaganda assets to [negate] and
      refute the attacks of the critics. Book reviews and feature
      articles are particularly appropriate for this purpose. The
      unclassified attachments to this guidance should provide useful
      background material for passing to assets. Our ploy should point
      out, as applicable, that the critics are (I) wedded to theories
      adopted before the evidence was in, (I) politically interested,
      (III) financially interested, (IV) hasty and inaccurate in their
      research, or (V) infatuated with their own theories. In the course
      of discussions of the whole phenomenon of criticism, a useful
      strategy may be to single out Epstein's theory for attack, using
      the attached Fletcher [?] article and Spectator piece for
      background. (Although Mark Lane's book is much less convincing
      that Epstein's and comes off badly where confronted by
      knowledgeable critics, it is also much more difficult to answer as
      a whole, as one becomes lost in a morass of unrelated details.)<br>
      <br>
      4. In private to media discussions not directed at any particular
      writer, or in attacking publications which may be yet forthcoming,
      the following arguments should be useful:<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. No significant new evidence has emerged
      which the Commission did not consider. The assassination is
      sometimes compared (e.g., by Joachim Joesten and Bertrand Russell)
      with the Dreyfus case; however, unlike that case, the attack on
      the Warren Commission have produced no new evidence, no new
      culprits have been convincingly identified, and there is no
      agreement among the critics. (A better parallel, though an
      imperfect one, might be with the Reichstag fire of 1933, which
      some competent historians (Fritz Tobias, AJ.P. Taylor, D.C. Watt)
      now believe was set by Vander Lubbe on his own initiative, without
      acting for either Nazis or Communists; the Nazis tried to pin the
      blame on the Communists, but the latter have been more successful
      in convincing the world that the Nazis were to blame.)<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Critics usually overvalue particular items
      and ignore others. They tend to place more emphasis on the
      recollections of individual witnesses (which are less reliable and
      more divergent--and hence offer more hand-holds for criticism) and
      less on ballistics, autopsy, and photographic evidence. A close
      examination of the Commission's records will usually show that the
      conflicting eyewitness accounts are quoted out of context, or were
      discarded by the Commission for good and sufficient reason.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. Conspiracy on the large scale often
      suggested would be impossible to conceal in the United States,
      esp. since informants could expect to receive large royalties,
      etc. Note that Robert Kennedy, Attorney General at the time and
      John F. Kennedy's brother, would be the last man to overlook or
      conceal any conspiracy. And as one reviewer pointed out,
      Congressman Gerald R. Ford would hardly have held his tongue for
      the sake of the Democratic administration, and Senator Russell
      would have had every political interest in exposing any misdeeds
      on the part of Chief Justice Warren. A conspirator moreover would
      hardly choose a location for a shooting where so much depended on
      conditions beyond his control: the route, the speed of the cars,
      the moving target, the risk that the assassin would be discovered.
      A group of wealthy conspirators could have arranged much more
      secure conditions.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d. Critics have often been enticed by a form of
      intellectual pride: they light on some theory and fall in love
      with it; they also scoff at the Commission because it did not
      always answer every question with a flat decision one way or the
      other. Actually, the make-up of the Commission and its staff was
      an excellent safeguard against over-commitment to any one theory,
      or against the illicit transformation of probabilities into
      certainties.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; e. Oswald would not have been any sensible
      person's choice for a co-conspirator. He was a "loner," mixed up,
      of questionable reliability and an unknown quantity to any
      professional intelligence service.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; f. As to charges that the Commission's report
      was a rush job, it emerged three months after the deadline
      originally set. But to the degree that the Commission tried to
      speed up its reporting, this was largely due to the pressure of
      irresponsible speculation already appearing, in some cases coming
      from the same critics who, refusing to admit their errors, are now
      putting out new criticisms.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; g. Such vague accusations as that "more than
      ten people have died mysteriously" can always be explained in some
      natural way e.g.: the individuals concerned have for the most part
      died of natural causes; the Commission staff questioned 418
      witnesses (the FBI interviewed far more people, conduction 25,000
      interviews and re interviews), and in such a large group, a
      certain number of deaths are to be expected. (When Penn Jones, one
      of the originators of the "ten mysterious deaths" line, appeared
      on television, it emerged that two of the deaths on his list were
      from heart attacks, one from cancer, one was from a head-on
      collision on a bridge, and one occurred when a driver drifted into
      a bridge abutment.)<br>
      <br>
      5. Where possible, counter speculation by encouraging reference to
      the Commission's Report itself. Open-minded foreign readers should
      still be impressed by the care, thoroughness, objectivity and
      speed with which the Commission worked. Reviewers of other books
      might be encouraged to add to their account the idea that,
      checking back with the report itself, they found it far superior
      to the work of its critics.<br>

      </div>
      <b><br>
      </b>Do you smirk when you hear someone question the official
      stories of Orlando, San Bernardino, Paris or Nice? Do you feel
      superior to 2,500 architects and engineers, to firefighters,
      commercial and military pilots, physicists and chemists, and
      former high government officials who have raised doubts about
      9/11? If so, you reflect the profile of a mind-controlled CIA
      stooge.<br>
      <br>
      The term “conspiracy theory” was invented and put into public
      discourse by the CIA in 1964 in order to discredit the many
      skeptics who challenged the Warren Commission’s conclusion that
      President John F. Kennedy was assassinated by a lone gunman named
      Lee Harvey Oswald, who himself was assassinated while in police
      custody before he could be questioned.<br>
      <br>
      The CIA used its friends in the media to launch a campaign to make
      suspicion of the Warren Commission report a target of ridicule and
      hostility. This campaign was “one of the most successful
      propaganda initiatives of all time.”<br>
      <br>
      So writes political science professor Lance deHaven-Smith, who in
      his peer-reviewed book, Conspiracy Theory in America, published by
      the University of Texas Press, tells the story of how the CIA
      succeeded in creating in the public mind reflexive, automatic,
      stigmatization of those who challenge government explanations.<br>
      <br>
      This is an extremely important and readable book, one of those
      rare books with the power to break you out of The Matrix.<b><br>
      </b><br>
      Professor deHaven-Smith is able to write this book because the
      original CIA Dispatch #1035-960, which sets out the CIA plot, was
      obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request. Apparently,
      the bureaucracy did not regard a document this old as being of any
      importance. The document is marked “Destroy when no longer
      needed,” but somehow wasn’t. CIA Dispatch #1035-960 is reproduced
      in the book.<br>
      <br>
      The success that the CIA has had in stigmatizing skepticism of
      government explanations has made it difficult to investigate State
      Crimes Against Democracy (SCAD) such as 9/11. With the public mind
      programmed to ridicule “conspiracy kooks,” even in the case of
      suspicious events such as 9/11 the government can destroy
      evidence, ignore prescribed procedures, delay an investigation,
      and then form a political committee to put its imprimatur on the
      official story. Professor deHaven-Smith notes that in such events
      as Kennedy’s assassination and 9/11 official police and
      prosecutorial investigations are never employed. The event is
      handed off to a political commission whose job is to produce a
      coverup.<br>
      <br>
      Professor deHaven-Smith’s book supports what I have told my
      readers: The government controls the story from the beginning by
      having the official explanation ready the moment a SCAD occurs.
      This makes any other explanation a “conspiracy theory.” This is
      the way Professor deHaven-Smith puts it:<br>
      <br>
      “A SCAD approach to memes assumes further that the CIA and other
      possibly participating agencies are formulating memes well in
      advance of operations, and therefore SCAD memes appear and are
      popularized very quickly before any competing concepts are on the
      scene.”<br>
      <br>
      The CIA’s success in controlling public perception of what our
      Founding Fathers would have regarded as suspicious events
      involving the government enables those in power positions within
      government to orchestrate events that serve hidden agendas. The
      events of September 11 created the new paradigm of endless war in
      behalf of a Washington-dominated world. The CIA’s success in
      controlling public perceptions has made it impossible to
      investigate elite political crimes. Consequently, it is now
      possible for treason to be official US government policy.<br>
      <br>
      Professor deHaven-Smith’s book will tell you the story of the
      assassination of President Kennedy by elements of the US military,
      CIA, and Secret Service. Just as the Warren Commission covered up
      the State Crime Against Democracy, Professor deHaven-Smith shows
      why we should doubt the official 9/11 story. And anything else
      that the government tells us.<b><br>
      </b><br>
      Read this book. It is short. It is affordable. It is reality
      preparation. It will innoculate you against being a dumbshit,
      insouciant, brainwashed American, or European, or Russian, or
      Chinese. I am surprised that the CIA has not purchased the entire
      print run and burned the books. Perhaps the CIA feels secure from
      its success in brainwashing the public and does not believe that
      American democracy and accountable government can be restored.<br>
      <br>
      Is the CIA correct that the American people are forever
      brainwashed, subject only to the explanations given by their
      overlords?<br>
      <br>
      If so, all Americans are slated to be the most oppressed people in
      history.<br>

      </b>Before turning on bedside lights, the oscilloscope detects a
      small amount of 'background energy' in the mattress. But after
      turning on the bedside lights, this causes a lot more
      electromagnetic energy to flow through the mattress. In other
      words, the oscilloscope detects larger amounts of energy, and at
      many different frequencies. Therefore, the ordinary electrical
      energy floating around in your room caused by lighting becomes
      amplified by your metal coil mattresses. <b><br>

      </div>
      <b><br>
      </b>Sophisticated techniques can decode stimulus representations
      for items held in a person's working memory. However, when
      subjects shift their attention toward something else, the neural
      representation of the now unattended item drops to baseline, as
      though the item has been forgotten. Rose et al. used single-pulse
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to briefly reactivate the
      representation of an unattended item. A short pulse of TMS
      enhanced recognition of “forgotten” stimuli, bringing an
      unattended item back into focal attention.<br>
      <b><br>
        Abstract<br>
        <br>
      </b>The ability to hold information in working memory is
      fundamental for cognition. Contrary to the long-standing view that
      working memory depends on sustained, elevated activity, we present
      evidence suggesting that humans can hold information in working
      memory via “activity-silent” synaptic mechanisms. Using
      multivariate pattern analyses to decode brain activity patterns,
      we found that the active representation of an item in working
      memory drops to baseline when attention shifts away. A targeted
      pulse of transcranial magnetic stimulation produced a brief
      reemergence of the item in concurrently measured brain activity.
      This reactivation effect occurred and influenced memory
      performance only when the item was potentially relevant later in
      the trial, which suggests that the representation is dynamic and
      modifiable via cognitive control. The results support a synaptic
      theory of working memory.<b><br>

      </div>
      <b><br>
      </b>&nbsp;The human brain can hold 10 times more memories than
      previously believed, according to a new study. The key to its
      amazing ability lies in synapses, the neural connections
      responsible for storing memories.<br>
      <br>
      Researchers from the Salk Institute found that each synapse can
      hold about 4.7 bits of information. This means that the human
      brain has a capacity of one petabyte, or 1,000,000,000,000,000
      bytes. This is equivalent to approximately 20 million four-drawer
      filing cabinets filled with text.<br>
      <br>
      "This is a real bombshell in the field of neuroscience...our new
      measurements of the brain's memory capacity increase conservative
      estimates by a factor of 10 to at least a petabyte, in the same

        Abstract<br>
        <br>
      </b>Information in a computer is quantified by the number of bits
      that can be stored and recovered. An important question about the
      brain is how much information can be stored at a synapse through
      synaptic plasticity, which depends on the history of probabilistic
      synaptic activity. The strong correlation between size and
      efficacy of a synapse allowed us to estimate the variability of
      synaptic plasticity. In an EM reconstruction of hippocampal
      neuropil we found single axons making two or more synaptic
      contacts onto the same dendrites, having shared histories of
      presynaptic and postsynaptic activity. The spine heads and neck
      diameters, but not neck lengths, of these pairs were nearly
      identical in size. We found that there is a minimum of 26
      distinguishable synaptic strengths, corresponding to storing 4.7
      bits of information at each synapse. Because of stochastic
      variability of synaptic activation the observed precision requires
      averaging activity over several minutes.<b><br>

      <b><br>
      </b>...Researchers have created an artificial red blood cell that
      effectively picks up oxygen in the lungs and delivers it to
      tissues throughout the body...<br>
      <br>
      The artificial blood cell, which is about one-fiftieth the size of
      a normal red blood cell, is made from purified human hemoglobin
      proteins that have been coated with a synthetic polymer, Doctor
      said. Hemoglobin is the component inside red blood cells that
      carries oxygen throughout the body...<br>
      <br>
      The synthetic polymer coating of the latest artificial blood cell
      appears to solve both these problems, Doctor explained. The
      coating was developed by the study’s lead researcher, Dipanjan
      Pan, an assistant professor of bioengineering with the University
      of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign...<br>
      <br>
      The polymer coating also keeps the hemoglobin from reacting with
      nitric oxide in the bloodstream, thus preventing dangerous
      constriction of the blood vessels, he added.<br>
      <br>
      There’s also one more benefit -- because the polymer coating is
      “immune silent,” the artificial blood can be used in anyone
      regardless of blood type, Doctor said...<br>
      <br>
      However, the artificial red blood cells will never totally replace
      the real thing, Doctor said.<br>
      <br>
      For one thing, they can’t remain in the bloodstream anywhere near
      as long as regular red blood cells.<br>
      <br>
      “A normal red blood cell circulates about 120 days. This cell
      right now, we project circulation for about a third of a day to
      half a day,” Doctor said. “We may be able to manipulate that and
      get it up to a couple of days, but I seriously doubt we’ll be able
      to get to the circulation time of a normal red blood cell.”<br>
      <br>
      The artificial cell also is designed solely to deliver oxygen, and
      leaves out a number of other functions that red blood cells
      provide...<b><br>

        Inventor: LANZA GREGORY, et al.<br>
        <br>
      </b>The present disclosure provides oxygen-carrying nanoparticles,
      methods of making the nanoparticles, and methods of using the
      nanoparticles to carry oxygen in blood.<b><br>
        <br>
        BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
        <br>
      </b>[0003] Blood transfusions are life-saving procedures used in
      medical conditions and emergencies to replace lost components of
      the blood. According to the American Red Cross, someone in the
      U.S. needs blood every two seconds, more than 44,000 blood
      donations are needed every day, and a total of 30 million blood
      components are transfused each year in the U.S. A single car
      accident victim can require as many as 100 pints of blood. In
      addition, patients with diseases such as sickle cell anemia and
      cancer affect millions of people in the U.S., and patients with
      these diseases can require frequent blood transfusions throughout
      their lives. Major worldwide blood shortages, infected donated
      blood, the necessity for blood typing, a short shelf life of
      stored blood, and the inadequacy of stored blood for use in
      certain situations such as battlefield scenarios and trauma, have
      led scientists to synthesize and test blood substitute products.
      Although non-blood volume expanders for cases where only volume
      restoration is required are widely available, to date there is no
      well accepted oxygen-carrying blood substitutes. Perfluorocarbon
      based oxygen-carrying products rely on dissolved oxygen, dissolve
      3 times more in oxygen than red blood cells, and have a long shelf
      life. However, PFC-based products have failed due to poor oxygen
      delivery functionality, short half-life in circulation, complement
      activation by pluronic surfactants in PFC-based products, and
      require cold storage at freezing temperatures. On the other hand,
      currently available hemoglobin based oxygen carriers (HBOCs) have
      a short period of functionality during circulation, have poor
      oxygen capture and release dynamics, and are incompatible with dry
      storage, limiting their use in remote areas. In addition,
      hemoglobin based oxygen carriers have been shown to be unsafe,
      causing hemodynamic and gastrointestinal perturbations related to
      nitric oxide (NO) scavenging, free radical induction, and
      alteration of biochemical and hematological parameters such as
      increased liver enzyme levels and platelet aggregation.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] Therefore, there is a need for a safe and efficient
      oxygen-carrying blood substitute having adequate oxygen capture
      and release dynamics that does not interfere with normal
      regulation of blood vessel caliber, is capable of maintaining
      oxygen-carrying functionality during circulation, and is amenable
      to extended storage and ease of use.<b><br>
        <br>
        SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
        <br>
      </b>[0005] Accordingly, in one aspect, the present disclosure
      provides an oxygen-carrying nanoparticle. The nanoparticle has a
      substantially bi-concaved disc shape, comprises an aqueous core
      and a shell comprising an amphiphilic polymer. The nanoparticle
      also comprises an oxygen-carrying agent, an allosteric effector,
      and a reducing agent. The amphiphilic polymer may comprise a
      branched polymer conjugated to a lipid. The surface of the
      amphiphilic polymer comprising the outer layer of the shell may be
      derivatized with polyethylene glycol. The average diameter of the
      nanoparticle may be from about 150 nm to about 300 nm, and the
      average height of the nanoparticle is from about 30 nm to about 80

      The rhythm of breathing through the nose sparks electrical

        <br>
        <b>By Marla Paul</b><br>
      </div>
      <b><br>
      </b>Northwestern Medicine scientists have discovered for the first
      time that the rhythm of breathing creates electrical activity in
      the human brain that enhances emotional judgments and memory
      recall.<br>
      <br>
      These effects on behavior depend critically on whether you inhale
      or exhale and whether you breathe through the nose or mouth.<b><br>
        <br>
      </b>In the study, individuals were able to identify a fearful face
      more quickly if they encountered the face when breathing in
      compared to breathing out. Individuals also were more likely to
      remember an object if they encountered it on the inhaled breath
      than the exhaled one. The effect disappeared if breathing was
      through the mouth.<br>
      <br>
      “One of the major findings in this study is that there is a
      dramatic difference in brain activity in the amygdala and
      hippocampus during inhalation compared with exhalation,” said lead
      author Christina Zelano, assistant professor of neurology at
      Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. “When you
      breathe in, we discovered you are stimulating neurons in the
      olfactory cortex, amygdala and hippocampus, all across the limbic
      system.”<br>
      <br>
      The study was published Dec. 6 in the Journal of Neuroscience. <br>
      <br>
      The senior author is Jay Gottfried, professor of neurology at
      Feinberg.<br>
      <br>
      Northwestern scientists first discovered these differences in
      brain activity while studying seven patients with epilepsy who
      were scheduled for brain surgery. A week prior to surgery, a
      surgeon implanted electrodes into the patients’ brains in order to
      identify the origin of their seizures. This allowed scientists to
      acquire electro-physiological data directly from their brains. The
      recorded electrical signals showed brain activity fluctuated with
      breathing. The activity occurs in brain areas where emotions,
      memory and smells are processed.<b><br>
        <br>
        Nose Mouth Time<br>
        <br>
      </b>This discovery led scientists to ask whether cognitive
      functions typically associated with these brain areas — in
      particular fear processing and memory — could also be affected by
      breathing.<br>
      <br>
      The amygdala is strongly linked to emotional processing, in
      particular fear-related emotions. So scientists asked about 60
      subjects to make rapid decisions on emotional expressions in the
      lab environment while recording their breathing. Presented with
      pictures of faces showing expressions of either fear or surprise,
      the subjects had to indicate, as quickly as they could, which
      emotion each face was expressing.<b><br>
        <br>
      </b>When faces were encountered during inhalation, subjects
      recognized them as fearful more quickly than when faces were
      encountered during exhalation. This was not true for faces
      expressing surprise. These effects diminished when subjects
      performed the same task while breathing through their mouths. Thus
      the effect was specific to fearful stimuli during nasal breathing
      only.<br>
      <br>
      In an experiment aimed at assessing memory function — tied to the
      hippocampus — the same subjects were shown pictures of objects on
      a computer screen and told to remember them. Later, they were
      asked to recall those objects. Researchers found that recall was
      better if the images were encountered during inhalation.<br>
      <br>
      The findings imply that rapid breathing may confer an advantage
      when someone is in a dangerous situation, Zelano said.<br>
      <br>
      “If you are in a panic state, your breathing rhythm becomes
      faster,” Zelano said. “As a result you’ll spend proportionally
      more time inhaling than when in a calm state. Thus, our body’s
      innate response to fear with faster breathing could have a
      positive impact on brain function and result in faster response
      times to dangerous stimuli in the environment.”<br>
      <br>
      Another potential insight of the research is on the basic
      mechanisms of meditation or focused breathing. “When you inhale,
      you are in a sense synchronizing brain oscillations across the
      limbic network,” Zelano noted.<br>
      <br>
      Other Northwestern authors include Heidi Jiang, Guangyu Zhou,
      Nikita Arora, Dr. Stephan Schuele and Dr. Joshua Rosenow.<b><br>

          liquid form</b><br>
      </div>
      <b><br>
      </b>A new study, led by Professor Jae Sung Son of Materials
      Science and Engineering at UNIST has succeeded in developing a new
      technique that can be used to turn industrial waste heat into
      electricity for vehicles and other applications.<br>
      <br>
      In their study, the team presented a new type of high-performance
      thermoelectric (TE) materials that possess liquid-like properties.
      These newly developed materials are both shape-engineerable and
      geometrically compatible in that they can be directly
      brush-painted on almost any surface.<br>
      <br>
      Scientists hope that their findings, described in the journal
      Nature Communications this week, will pave the way to designing
      materials and devices that can be easily transferred to other
      applications.<br>
      <br>
      The thermoelectric effect is the direct conversion of temperature
      differences to electric voltage and vice versa. This effect can be
      used either for heating or for cooling, such as in small cooling
      systems, automotive cooling systems, as well as waste heat
      recovery system for ships. In addition, the thermoelectric
      generator modules used in these devices are configured as
      rectangular parallelepipeds.<br>
      <br>
      The output power of thermoelectric generators depends on device
      engineering minimizing heat loss, as well as inherent material
      properties. According to the research team, the currently existing
      liquid-like TE materials have been largely neglected due to the
      limited flat or angular shape of devices.<br>
      <br>
      However, considering that the surface of most heat sources where
      these planar devices are attached is curved, a considerable amount
      of heat loss is inevitable. To address this issue, the research
      team presented the shape-engineerable thermoelectric painting
      technique where they they directly brush TE paints onto the
      surface of heat sources to produce electricity.<br>
      <br>
      Using this technique, one can now easily achive electricity via
      the application of TE paints on the exterior surfaces of
      buildings, roofs, and cars. Scientists hope that their findings
      will pave the way to designing materials and devices that can be
      easily transferred to other applications.<br>
      <br>
      To show the feasibility of the currently proposed technology, they
      also fabricated TE generators through painting TE paints on flat,
      curved and large-sized hemispherical substrates, demonstrating
      that it is the most effective means of heat energy collection from
      any heat sources with exceedingly high output power density of
      4.0?mW?cm?2, which is the best value among the reported printed TE
      generators.<br>
      <br>
      "By developing integral thermoelectric modules through painting
      process, we have overcome limitations of flat thermoelectric
      modules and are able to collect heat energy more efficiently."
      said Professor Son. "Thermoelectric generation systems can be
      developed as whatever types user want and cost from manufacturing
      systems can also be greatly reduced by conserving materials and
      simplifying processes.."<br>
      <br>
      "Our thermoelectric material can be applied any heat source
      regardless of its shape, type and size." said Professor Son. "It
      will place itself as a new type of new and renewable energy
      generating system."<b><br>

      inorganic paints using the molecular Sb2Te3 chalcogenidometalate
      as a sintering aid for thermoelectric particles, with ZT values of
      0.67 for n-type and 1.21 for p-type painted materials that compete
      the bulk values. Devices directly brush-painted onto curved
      surfaces produced the high output power of 4.0?mW?cm-2. This
      approach paves the way to designing materials and devices that can

      </b>...Pam and Russ Martens, proprietors of the delightful
      website, www.wallstreetonparade.com, have researched PropOrNot to
      identify the corrupt forces that intend to make it a crime to
      speak truthfully in America.<br>
      <br>
      It wasn’t easy to find out as those responsible for the website
      are hidden behind multiple covers like offshore tax avoidance
      corporations. But this is what they found out:<br>
      <br>
      PropOrNot has an agent address in Sante Fe, New Mexico. An agent
      address serves “as a virtual address for the creation of limited
      liability corporations that want to keep their actual principals
      secret. The address has dozens of businesses associated with it.
      There should also be a corresponding business listed in the online
      archives of the business registry at the Secretary of State of New
      Mexico. However, no business with the words Propaganda or
      PropOrNot or YYY exist in the New Mexico business registry,
      suggesting PropOrNot is using a double cloaking device to shield
      its identity by registering under a completely different name.”<br>
      <br>
      Obviously, those behind PropOrNot are either so ashamed of their
      perfidy or they are such public names that they want to stay
      hidden so that the American public cannot know who is determined
      to replace truth with lie.<br>
      <br>
      And public names it is. The Martens find PropOrNot background ties
      to the billionaire Koch brothers, to the Lynde and Harry Bradley
      Foundation, to the Sarah Scaife Foundation (the Mellon fortune),
      ExxonMobil, US Senators Chris Murphy and Rob Portman, who tie into
      Citigroup and Goldman Sachs, “two Wall Street behemoths that would
      very much like to pivot the national debate to anything other than
      Wall Street power and corruption.”<br>

      laboratory chief Sergey Kiselev, skin cells are most suitable for
      reprogramming as tissue retrieval is not harmful for patients. He
      also said that members of a family with hereditary macular
      degeneration will be the first patients, who will get retinas from
      reprogrammed cells. The scientific center’s researchers are going

      </b>42.8 kHz 50W Ultrasonic Piezo Transducer<br>
      <br>
      This is a special Ultrasonic Piezo Transducer. It's special
      because 42.8 kHz is claimed by many sources, starting with John
      Keely, as well as Bob Boyce, to be the frequency to dissociate
      water. I.e. to break the molecular bonds and so possibly use less
      energy to split apart the water, than the energy it produces when
      water is created.<br>
      <br>
      Another famous experiment claimed to shoot a column of water in
      which there was produced a standing wave from 42.8kHz transducer,
      straight up through the roof, making a clean hole in the ceiling.
      We haven't verified these claims, and sell these rare transducers
      for people who want to experiment with this famous frequency.<br>
      <br>
      These transducers are 40mm (1.6") in diameter, and are resonant at
      42.8kHz, but will handle about 41.8kHz to 43.8kHz at somewhat
      reduced power. Sale includes ONE piece, although the picture shows
      two. We only have a few of these.<br>
      <br>
      Here's a quote and a link. Or you can google '42.8khz water':<br>
      <br>
      "Dr. X took periodic readings of his instrumentation and was
      assured that the standing wave was being maintained. Suddenly,
      with no warning whatever the water disappeared from the open
      quartz tube. He looked up thinking to see the water splashed on
      the ceiling when to his amazement a clean hole went right through
      the ceiling. The hole was the same size as the inside of the
      quartz tube."<br>
      <br>
      And make sure it's epoxied or bolted to a vessel filled with water
      before powering it. If the vessel is empty or transducer is not
      attached to anything, it can shatter upon powering it.<b><br>

          doctors shock tumour to death with testosterone</b><br>

      <b><br>
      </b>A man with advanced prostate cancer is believed to be cured
      after doctors 'shocked' his tumour to death with huge amounts of
      testosterone.<br>
      <br>
      The result has been described as 'unexpected' and 'exciting'
      because most prostate cancer therapies work by depriving tumours
      of testosterone, because cancer uses it as a fuel.<br>
      <br>
      Other seriously ill men taking part in the same trial showed
      responses that astounded scientists, with tumours shrinking and
      the progress of their disease halted.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      Levels of Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA), a blood marker used to
      monitor prostate cancer, also fell in the majority of the 47
      participants.<br>
      <br>
      One individual whose PSA levels dropped to zero after three months
      and shows no remaining trace of the disease after 22 cycles of
      treatment appears to be cured, said the researchers. <br>
      <br>
      Professor Sam Denmeade, from Johns Hopkins University School of
      Medicine in Baltimore, US, who led the study, said: ""Our goal is
      to shock the cancer cells by exposing them rapidly to very high
      followed by very low levels of testosterone in the blood. The
      results are unexpected and exciting. <br>
      <br>
      "We are still in the early stages of figuring out how this works
      and how to incorporate it into the treatment paradigm for prostate
      cancer.<br>
      <br>
      "Many of the men have stable disease that has not progressed for
      more than 12 months.<br>
      <b><br>
      </b>"I think we may have cured one man whose PSA dropped to zero
      after three months and has remained so now for 22 cycles. His
      disease has all disappeared."<br>
      <br>
      All of the patients had spreading cancer that was resistant to
      treatment with two of the latest hormone therapy drugs,
      abiraterone and enzalutamide.<br>
      <br>
      The trial involved three cycles of "bipolar androgen therapy"
      (BAT) which involves alternately flooding and starving the body of
      the male hormone testosterone.<br>
      <br>
      The treatment is revolutionary because testosterone is generally
      assumed to fuel prostate cancer. For decades men with advanced and
      spreading prostate cancer have been treated by cutting off the
      supply of testosterone or blocking its effects.<br>
      <br>
      In contrast upping testosterone in a man with prostate cancer is
      generally considered similar to pouring petrol on a fire.<br>
      <b><br>
      </b>Yet laboratory experiments had hinted that blasting tumours
      with high levels of the hormone might suppress or even kill
      prostate cancer cells.<br>
      <br>
      The men received high dose injections of testosterone once every
      28 days. At the same time, they were given a drug that stopped
      testosterone being produced naturally by the testicles.<br>
      <br>
      Prof Denmeade said it was still not clear how the treatment
      worked, but it appeared to involve cell signalling and part of the
      process of cell division. <br>
      <br>
      Large doses of testosterone also seemed to cause prostate cancer
      cells to make breaks in their DNA.<br>
      <br>
      Cancer cells stopped dividing and turned "senescent", meaning they
      "become like old men who sit around and tell stories but don't
      make much trouble", said the professor.<br>
      <br>
      Each year around 47,000 men are diagnosed with prostate cancer in
      the UK and 11,000 die from the disease<br>
      <br>
      Dr Matt Hobbs, deputy director of research at the charity Prostate
      Cancer UK, said: "Drugs that reduce the levels of testosterone
      (androgen deprivation therapy) are an effective treatment for
      thousands of men with advanced prostate cancer.<br>
      <br>
      "However, at some point the cancer evolves and those drugs stop
      working. This research is intriguing because it offers a hint that
      - somewhat unexpectedly - for some men whose cancers have reached
      that 'hormone-resistant' stage it may be possible to kill or stop
      growth of the cancer cells by actually overloading them with
      testosterone.<br>
      <br>
      "Many exciting new lines of attack against prostate cancer are
      emerging of which this is one.<br>
      <br>
      "However, this is early stage research and further studies are
      needed in order to understand exactly how intriguing developments
      like this work and to test the findings more robustly in large
      clinical trials."<br>
      <br>
      The early findings from the on-going study were presented at at
      symposium on Molecular Targets and Cancer Therapeutics in Munich,
      Germany.<br>

          waste-formed radioactive diamonds provide long-lasting energy</b><br>
      </div>
      <b><br>
      </b>Scientists have discovered a way to convert nuclear waste into
      radioactive black diamond batteries which last more than 5,000
      years.<br>
      <br>
      Researchers at the University of Bristol have found a means of
      creating a battery capable of generating clean electricity for
      five millennia, or as long as human civilization has existed.<br>
      <br>
      Scientists found that by heating graphite blocks – used to house
      uranium rods in nuclear reactors – much of the radioactive carbon
      is given off as a gas.<br>
      <br>
      This can then be gathered and turned into radioactive diamonds
      using a high-temperature chemical reaction, in which carbon atoms
      are left on the surface in small, dark-colored diamond crystals.<br>
      <br>
      These man-made diamonds produce a small electrical charge when
      placed near a radioactive source.<br>
      <br>
      The radioactive diamonds are then encased safely within a layer of
      non-radioactive diamond. The surface of a complete diamond emits
      less radiation than a banana.<br>
      <br>
      The Bristol scientists have already created a working diamond
      battery from nickel-63, a radioactive isotope more stable than
      carbon-14, which is prevalent in nuclear waste.<br>
      <br>
      They will create their first carbon-14 batteries in the New Year.<b><br>

      </b>Mrfixitrick shows a series of seven experiments with his
      Spooky Tesla Spirit Radio, a non-powered crystal radio circuit
      built in a jam-jar, that does more than just be a radio.<b><br>
        <br>
      </b>This simple device shows abilities such as: detecting
      lightning, making voice phenomena, interacting with all forms of
      light, creating music and sound effects, reading a computer
      screen, acting as a mike, and detecting RF pulses.<br>
      <br>
      The Spooky Tesla Spirit Radio is plugged directly into the iMac
      computer sound-in port. Audio Hijack Pro software provides the
      gain and real time sound effects based on the radio's input.<br>
      <br>
      The radio's antennas are inspired by Tesla's high voltage
      examples, and its basic LC circuit is similar to Tesla's original
      inductor and capacitor circuit schematics.<br>
      <br>
      The Spooky Tesla Spirit Radio recently won the monthly Gadget

      </b>John C. Lilly was a neuroscientist who invented the Lilly wave
      or the Lilly pulse, which is a balanced bidirectional pulse
      pair... This wave is useful because it does not damage brain
      tissue when an electric current is applied to the brain via
      electrodes. Using this waveform prevents both thermal and
      electrolytic damage. <b><br>

          Control) </b><br>
      </div>
      <b><br>
      </b>The Lilly Wave called a balanced bidirectional pulse pair
      invented by John Cunningham Lilly is a carrier waveform that
      bypasses the minds subconscious defense systems. It has been
      monitored via oscilloscopes connected to homes A/C ground and
      neutral of power lines. It can be used to transmit mind control
      via ultrasonic (1 10MHz) and electromagnetic wavelengths (600m to
      1e-15m). It’s described as a bi-phasic electric pulse which
      stimulates the neurons of the brain to resonate at a certain
      frequency, thus the Lilly wave has the ability to control the
      brainwave patterns of the brain.<br>
      <br>
      There is however a far more advanced form and a largely unknown
      and suppressed purpose in the use of the Lilly Wave.<br>
      <br>
      The water molecules within the brain can be made to resonate at a
      desired frequency thus causing the electrons that comprise the
      brains electrical voltages to also resonate at the same frequency.<br>
      <br>
      It is not a requirement, as is understood by the majority of
      science, to implant electrodes to cause the brains water molecules
      to be entrained to a certain frequency, it can also be
      accomplished by any waveform that can penetrate the skull and
      cause the entrainment of the brains water molecules.<br>
      <br>
      For example, radio waves emitted at a frequency of 40hz, targeted
      at a persons brain, will entrain the water molecules to a degree
      of 40hz and thus the rest of the brains electrons will resonate at
      such a frequency.<br>
      <br>
      In this manner it is possible to stimulate and control the brains
      wave patterns remotely, with electromagnetism and also acoustic
      waves. However, it is imperative to understand that if the wave is
      not bi-phasic it will result in damage to the brains neurons and
      thus brain damage.<br>
      <br>
      It is not the case that only the brains water molecules than can
      be entrained, it is also true of the blood sugar. Iron within the
      cellular structure composing the neurons of the brain and various
      other elements, can also be entrained to resonate at a desired
      frequency.<b><br>
        <br>
      </b>If a molecule is targeted by a wave which resonates at the
      same frequency as that molecule, that molecule will explode, sugar
      is a crystal and crystals when stressed, broken or deformed,
      release an electric and electromagnetic charge, this is known as
      triboluminescence.<br>
      <br>
      The effect of an exploding sugar crystal is quite damaging to the
      mind and brain, it creates extreme confusion, dizziness, and also
      a state best described as lack of awareness, or apathy.<br>
      <br>
      The Lilly Wave frequency is a secret military application, it is
      known as the “madness” frequency.<br>
      <br>
      The Los Angeles Riots are said to have been the first open test of
      its capacity to mass control anger and violent response from the
      mob.<br>
      <br>
      Furthermore, there are other profound effects of entraining the
      brain and bloods iron molecules, one of which is to cause the iron
      to condense together via resonant attraction, and clump within the
      brain. This has the effect of causing the iron to be magnetised
      and rush to the top of your head, resulting in a rush of blood to
      the head and extreme confusion and dizziness, it can also be
      reversed which causes a draining of blood from the head, leading
      to all out unconsciousness.<br>
      <br>
      In short, the Lilly Wave is best described as a targeted resonance
      of the brains molecules.<br>
      <br>
      Use of the Lilly Wave can pretty much install any brainwave
      pattern into the mind of any targeted human, such as the negative
      aspects already mentioned and also to create happiness, or the
      ability to control ones physical movements. An attack direct to
      the water molecules is by far the best method to achieve the
      desired aims.<br>
      <br>
      It is possible to track the Lilly Wave through a spectrum analyser
      that you link up to a signal source, and if you know what wave
      forms to look for, in a TV signal for example, you can see all
      kinds of interesting things–like the Lilly wave.<br>
      <br>
      As already stated the Lilly Wave was invented by Dr. John Lily
      when he was working for NIH, the National Institutes for Health,
      in 1959 when they first started implanting dolphin brains and
      discovered that they needed to give the dolphin brain a chance to
      respond.<br>
      <b><br>
      </b>Then they discovered that they could use these same waves on
      human beings. He was doing work for the Navy at that time, and he
      got out of that research because he felt so conflicted about what
      they were doing.<br>
      <br>
      The Lilly Wave frequency will mostly be in the extremely low and
      sometimes in the ultra low frequency range, but they are
      complicated as they need to interact with certain brain molecules
      which have a resonant frequency of their own.<br>

          'Neurophone'</b><br>

      <b><br>
      </b>UPDATE: Neurophone inventor Patrick Flanagan has since
      confirmed this design CAN produce Neurophone effects, though it's
      still probably not as good as the real <br>
      thing. Some research suggests this is why: TL494's square-wave
      output gets differentiated by the piezos (which are capacitors),
      producing a "Lilly wave"-like signal that mimics signals produced
      by nerves. (The Lilly Wave, as far as I understand, is a sharp
      positive spike followed by an equal but negative one. Theidea is
      the first peak transports something, I think ions, across the
      barrier between nerves while negative spike brings them back so
      the nerves can use them again.)<br>
      <br>
      Overall, I did get it pretty wrong. It turns out you have to
      replace the leading and trailing edges of the audio waveform with
      ones that have a 40kHz slope, and then double differentiate it.
      The TL494 "Neurophone," while it does produce a tiny sliver of the
      real effect, is pretty far off.Also, it turns out "earplug-style"
      in-ear-monitor headphones produce some of (but probably not all)
      of the same effects a Neurophone does. (This was not confirmed or
      commented on by Flanagan as far as I know.) Try playing pink noise
      through them! See the post at<b> <a

      <div align="center"><b>Amazing Prophecy From 1981 Says U.S.
          Economy Will Collapse After Death Of Fidel Castro</b><br>
        <br>
        <b>Michael Snyder</b><br>
      </div>
      <b><br>
      </b>...Four out of the five major events named in an incredible
      1981 prophecy have already happened in consecutive order, and the
      only thing remaining to be fulfilled is “the collapse of the
      economic system of the United States”...<br>
      <br>
      Despite looking into these things for well over a decade, I had
      never heard of John W. Johnston before learning of this prophecy.
      He appears to have been a very simple man that lived near the
      beach in Virginia before moving to the mountains a couple of years
      ago. Since moving to the mountains he has only updated his website
      once, and that was in September 2014. At this point nobody seems
      to know what ultimately happened to him or if he is even still
      alive.<br>
      <br>
      But his website is still up, and so somebody must be keeping an
      eye on things. And the reason why so many people are talking about
      John W. Johnston right now is because of something that God told
      him in 1981…<br>
      <br>
      “When you see that the Berlin wall comes down and when you see the
      Soviet Union take a severe blow then it makes a recovery, and then
      you see the death of Fidel Castro; then shall come the collapse of
      the economic system of the United States.”<br>
      <br>
      This is an extraordinary prophecy, and in it Johnston was given
      five things to watch for.<br>
      <br>
      The first event was the Berlin wall coming down, and that happened
      in November 1989.<br>
      <br>
      The second event was a “severe blow” to the Soviet Union, and the
      collapse of the Soviet Union is generally regarded to have taken
      place in 1991.<br>
      <br>
      The third event was a “recovery” for the Soviet Union, and without
      a doubt Russia is once again a major player on the world stage
      today.<br>
      <br>
      The fourth event was the death of Fidel Castro, and that happened
      on Friday.<br>
      <br>
      So the only thing remaining to be fulfilled is “the collapse of
      the economic system of the United States”.<br>
      <br>
      Of course no time interval was given in the prophecy, and the
      other events have been fulfilled over many, many years, and so we
      can’t really say how quickly we should expect to see an economic
      collapse according to this prophecy.<b><br>
      </b><br>
      But without a doubt, this prophecy definitely got my attention.
      Here it is again in the context in which it originally appeared on
      Johnston’s website…<br>
      <br>
      Around 1981 God gave me a prophetic word of knowledge that has
      been partially fulfilled. These events are time markers and very
      soon we will see the fulfillment <br>
      of the rest of this word. The Lord told me the following:<br>
      <br>
      “When you see that the Berlin wall comes down and when you see the
      Soviet Union take a severe blow then it makes a recovery, and then
      you see the death of Fidel Castro; then shall come the collapse of
      the economic system of the United States.”<br>
      <br>
      The Berlin wall separated East Germany from West Germany for more
      than 25 years. The construction began on August 13, 1961. The wall
      was opened and many sections of it literally knocked down on
      November 9th, 1989.<br>
      <br>
      The Soviet Union is considered to have officially dissolved on
      December 31, 1991. <br>
      <br>
      This is when all official Soviet institutions had stopped to
      function in the different “republics” of the Soviet Union. The
      individual governments of these republics started functioning
      separately. The Soviet flag flew for the last time over the
      Kremlin.<b><br>
        <br>
      </b>As you know Fidel Castro is now a very old man in his 80’s and
      his health is not well. Cuba could very soon see the death of it’s
      long time Dictator.<br>
      <br>
      When you see Castro’s death then you will see the complete
      collapse of the economic system of America!<b><br>

      </b>Images on Google earth have revealed the existence of the
      four-sided structure, which bears an uncanny resemblance to the
      famous Egyptian pyramids built thousands of years ago. <br>

      <div align="center"><b>We finally know how the 'mind-altering' cat
          parasite controls our immune response<br>
          1 in 2 people are infected.</b><br>
      </div>
      <b><br>
      </b>Up to 50 percent of global population is infected by the 'cat
      parasite' Toxoplasma gondii, and in some areas, the infection rate
      is as high as 95 percent. Unless you get tested, there’s no way of
      knowing that you’re infected, but it’s been associated with a
      number of mental disorders, such as schizophrenia and bipolar
      disorder.<br>
      <br>
      Yep, Toxoplasma is everywhere, and while the jury is still out on
      how much it actually messes with our minds, scientists have
      finally figured out why it’s so good at dodging our body's immune
      response.<br>
      <br>
      For the uninitiated, Toxoplasma is a cat-borne parasite that
      causes Toxoplasmosis - a disease that is considered 'asymptomatic'
      in most healthy people, but can lead to a range of other disorders
      in those with compromised immune systems, such as pregnant women
      and the elderly.<br>
      <br>
      While most doctors wouldn’t recommend you bother testing for
      Toxoplasma unless you’re at risk of getting sick from it, studies
      have turned up curious links between it and certain host
      behaviours.<br>
      <br>
      At the forefront of this research is Jaroslav Flegr, an
      evolutionary biologist at Charles University in the Czech
      Republic, who once asserted that, "Toxoplasma might even kill as
      many people as malaria, or at least a million people a year,”
      because of how it appears to change our response to dangerous
      situations.<br>
      <br>
      Past research has found that when mice are infected by Toxoplasma,
      they lose their innate fear of cat urine, and display signs of
      impaired working memory. <br>
      <br>
      It's been hypothesised that the parasite messes with rodent brains
      to help it complete its life cycle, and for years now, scientists
      have been investigating if something similar is occurring in its
      human hosts. <br>
      <br>
      "There is a fascinating association between Toxoplasma infection
      and psychiatric diseases including schizophrenia and bipolar
      disorder," says parasite researcher Chris Tonkin from the Walter
      and Eliza Hall Institute in Australia.<br>
      <br>
      While there appears to be something strange going on with people
      infected by Toxoplasma, the scientific evidence is frustratingly
      inconclusive. <br>
      <br>
      But there’s one thing about Toxoplasma that’s far from ambiguous -
      its ability to manipulate our immune response. <br>
      <br>
      The fact that in some areas of the world, almost the entire local
      population is infected shows just how successful this parasite is,
      and its success lies in its ability to strike a delicate balance
      with our immune system.<br>
      <br>
      Toxoplasma has managed to keep the body's immune response to it
      low enough to ensure that it can still thrive in its human hosts,
      but high enough that those who are infected can live a healthy
      life as one giant parasite incubator.<br>
      <br>
      And now scientists have figured out how.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      "The parasite rewires the host's inflammatory response," says
      Matthew Bowler from the European Molecular Biology Laboratory. "It
      completely subverts the chain reaction that would normally trigger
      our body's defences."<br>
      <br>
      Under normal circumstances, when cells in your body detect a
      parasite, a series of molecular signals will activate a protein
      called p38a, prompting it to move into the cells' nuclei. Here, it
      activates the genes that trigger an inflammatory response to
      eliminate the pathogen.<br>
      <br>
      Interestingly, rather than simply blocking those signals,
      Toxoplasma gets its way by doing the exact opposite: Bowler and
      his team found that the parasite actually kickstarts the human
      inflammatory response, and proceeds to manipulate it according to
      its own needs. <br>
      <br>
      The research was based on a previous study led by Mohamed-Ali
      Hakimi from the <br>
      <br>
      Institute of Advances Bioscience in France, who found that
      Toxoplasma secretes a protein called GRA24 that activates the
      protein p38a directly, before the body's own immune system can get
      involved.<br>
      <br>
      The team has now figured out that GRA24 binds much more strongly
      to p33a than the cell's own proteins do, and this allows it to
      control the level of immune response <br>
      that the body dishes up.<br>
      <br>
      At the same time, the Toxoplasma protein also prevents the body
      from switching off the inflammatory response, which is why the
      disease can be so dangerous in people who already have weakened
      immune systems.<br>
      <br>
      "The tight control of the inflammatory signalling prevents either
      too weak a response leading to host death, or too strong a
      response preventing invasion," the team concludes.<br>
      <br>
      While it's a little disconcerting to find out just how easily this
      parasite can manipulate our entire immune system, the research
      could help scientists to develop more effective anti-inflammatory
      drugs.<br>
      <br>
      Right now, they're all focussed on blocking the activity of p33a,
      but Toxoplasma has demonstrated how a similar effect could be
      derived from finding an alternative way to activate and control
      it.<br>
      <br>
      Classic cats. We feed them and love them and all we get in return
      is a parasite that knows more about our immune response than we
      do. <br>

        Summary<br>
        <br>
      </b>The causative agent of toxoplasmosis, the intracellular
      parasite Toxoplasma gondii, delivers a protein, GRA24, into the
      cells it infects that interacts with the mitogen-activated protein
      (MAP) kinase p38a (MAPK14), leading to activation and nuclear
      translocation of the host kinase and a subsequent inflammatory
      response that controls the progress of the parasite. The
      purification of a recombinant complex of GRA24 and human p38a has
      allowed the molecular basis of this activation to be determined.
      GRA24 is shown to be intrinsically disordered, binding two kinases
      that act independently, and is the only factor required to bypass
      the canonical mitogen-activated protein kinase activation pathway.
      An adapted kinase interaction motif (KIM) forms a highly stable
      complex that competes with cytoplasmic regulatory partners. In
      addition, the recombinant complex forms a powerful in vitro tool
      to evaluate the specificity and effectiveness of p38a inhibitors
      that have advanced to clinical trials, as it provides a hitherto
      unavailable stable and highly active form of p38a.<b><br>

      "The objective here is to scale the “Crystal Set”, a step at a
      time, into a Tesla Transformer for the reception of medium wave
      band, 300 – 3000 kilocycle A.M.broadcasts. No license is required
      for this and the broadcast station provides the power.And this
      objective cooperates with the primary objective. That is; Who will
      be the first ham to disprove Einstein’s theory? An International
      contest, but who will sponsor it, Iran maybe? We have the good
      fortune in the “Crystal Set <br>
      <br>
      Initiative” that, in theory at least, a quarter wave A.M.
      broadcast tower, and its 120 quarter wave ground radials, must
      emit a pair of waves as shown by Tesla in his basic diagrams.<br>
      <br>
      Hence it can be seen that a pair of waves are engendered by this
      transmission system. (Tower and Star Radials). One wave, Hertzian,
      is the over ground wave, the other wave, Telluric, is the under
      ground wave. These two waves arrive at the point of reception in
      their own distinct time frames, giving rise to a difference in
      phase. Hence, multiple rings of interference patterns are
      produced. Since the Hertzian portion, over ground, time frame is
      based upon the velocity of light, then the Telluric portion, under
      ground, time frame gives the Telluric velocity. <br>
      <br>
      Two crystal sets, one over ground, one under ground, and a basic
      oscilloscope , that simple. I have done this at Landers.
      Concluding, a Tesla Magnification Transformer, properly
      proportioned can, in theory, actually draw power from a local 50
      kW station. Several hundred watts of power reception is likely.
      This would prove Tesla once and for all. No antenna, just a good
      ground, and a nice and bright 100 watt light bulb.This would
      overturn physics more than any billion dollar C.E.R.N. project. A
      ham radio operator overturns Einstein for 100 bucks. <br>

      I made a hemisphere from copper pipe, with a 16 point aluminum
      star as my top load. All that is left is to bury my 4 a/c
      radiators as my ground, wrap a 12" by 2 turn secondary coil on the
      bottom and build my resonant capacitor. Hopefully I can tune it up
      to receive some usable energy. U can follow me @<br>

      <b><br>
        Chapter One: The Fourth Turning.<br>
        <br>
      </b>Two historians William Strauss and Neil Howe wrote a very
      interesting book called, The Fourth Turning (1997).&nbsp; In this
      significant book the two authors show that the United States goes
      through a Turning every 80 to 85 years.<br>
      <br>
      The first turn was from 1776 to 1789 when the Republic was
      founded.<br>
      <br>
      The second turning was from 1860 to 1865 when the civil war
      erupted.<br>
      <br>
      The third turning was from 1940 to 1945, with the Great Depression
      and World War Two.<br>
      <br>
      The fourth turning is now. For the next 13 years until 2030 the
      Fourth Turning of the United States will be in full swing.<br>
      <br>
      What is interesting about these turnings is how each Turn reflects
      back on the Turn before.&nbsp; The issues that are unresolved in
      one turning are attempted to be resolved in the next Turn.&nbsp;
      For instance the Founding Fathers, in order to create a Union,
      more or less ignored and put off the most important problem our
      young country faced, which was slavery in the south.<br>
      <br>
      The second turning was all about solving that problem, which
      unfortunately resulted in 600,000 men, as well as many women and
      children being killed....<br>

          Creation of the STRAWMAN in the US</b><br>
      </div>
      <b><br>
      </b>In a private meeting with Woodrow Wilson (US President 1913 -
      1921) Colonel Edward Mandell House predicted the banksters' plans
      to enslave the American people. He stated:<b><br>
        <br>
      </b>"Very soon, every American will be required to register their
      biological property in a national system designed to keep track of
      the people and that will operate under the ancient system of
      pledging. By such methodology, we can compel people to submit to
      our agenda, which will affect our security as a charge back for
      our fiat paper currency.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      Every American will be forced to register or suffer being able to
      work and earn a living. They will be our chattels (property) and
      we will hold the security interest over them forever, by operation
      of the law merchant under the scheme of secured transactions.
      Americans, by unknowingly or unwittingly delivering the bills of
      lading (Birth Certificate) to us will be rendered bankrupt and
      insolvent, secured by their pledges.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      They will be stripped of their rights and given a commercial value
      designed to make us a profit and they will be none the wiser, for
      not one man in a million could ever figure our plans and, if by
      accident one or two should figure it out, we have in our arsenal
      plausible deniability. After all, this is the only logical way to
      fund government, by floating liens and debts to the registrants in
      the form of benefits and privileges.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      This will inevitably reap us huge profits beyond our wildest
      expectations and leave every American a contributor to this fraud,
      which we will call “Social Insurance.” Without realizing it, every
      American will unknowingly be our servant, however begrudgingly.
      The people will become helpless and without any hope for their
      redemption and we will employ the high office of our dummy
      corporation [ USA] to foment this plot against America."<b><br>

      </b>Motive: Flat Earth is Worse for Credibility than nearly any
      other Belief<br>
      <br>
      Motive: CIA &amp; Co-Conspirators have an Agenda to Discredit
      Conspiracy Truths and Conspiracy Aware People - What does Flat
      Earth do? Flat Earthers are completely discredited to the point of
      being effective eugenics hits, and conspiracy aware people are
      discredited by association<br>
      <br>
      Motive: Predictive Programming related to this new surge of flat
      earth material must include a demographic of people that now
      negatively associate irrational beliefs to general conspiracy
      aware people (i.e. Several Motives have been established)<br>
      <br>
      Motive: Who does this surge in flat earth material tangibly
      benefit? It discredits conspiracy truths, so obviously it benefits
      those involved in a global conspiracy<br>

        Brandt Closed Loop Optically Coupled BLDC Motor Drive System
        Operational Summary<br>
        <br>
      </b>Brushless DC (BLDC) Motors are used in a number of
      applications where low noise, highly efficient operation is
      desired. These motors compare favorably to other DC and AC motors.
      These motors are controlled by adjusting the field winding
      voltage/current typically in conjunction with monitoring the rotor
      position by means of position sensors and tachometers. Although,
      these motors are very efficient (&gt; 90% in some cases) they do
      require external power sources to drive the control circuitry and
      have losses. The losses are mechanical, primarily frictional, and
      electromagnetic. Frictional losses may be harnessed to aid in
      cooling the motor; however, electromagnetic losses are typically
      unaddressed.<br>
      <br>
      The Brandt Closed Loop Optically Coupled BLDC Motor Drive System
      is designed to harvest the unused electromagnetic energy. The
      system employs Hall sensors for position sensing, optical switches
      for phase excitation and a high performance controller IC equipped
      with top and bottom driver outputs, programmable oscillator,
      position sensor decoder. The system separates itself from other
      drivers by the use of a feedback circuit that captures
      electromagnetic energy from the field windings. The captured
      energy is converted to DC and added to the motor power improving
      the motor’s output and increasing its efficiency.<b><br>

      </div>
      <br>
      A P.E.I. farmer has helped lead to a researcher's discovery of an
      unlikely weapon in the battle against global warming: a seaweed
      that nearly eliminates the destructive methane content of cow
      burps and farts.<br>
      <br>
      Joe Dorgan began feeding his cattle seaweed from nearby beaches
      more than a decade ago as a way to cut costs on his farm in Seacow
      Pond. He was so impressed with the improvements he saw in his
      herd, he decided to turn the seaweed into a product.<br>
      <br>
      "There's a mixture of Irish moss, rockweed and kelp, and just
      going to waste," he said. "And I knew it was good because years
      ago, our ancestors, that's what they done their business with."<br>
      <br>
      Then researcher Rob Kinley caught wind of it.<br>
      <br>
      The agricultural scientist, then at Dalhousie University, helped
      test Dorgan's seaweed mix, and discovered it reduced the methane
      in the cows' burps and farts by about 20 per cent.<br>
      <br>
      Kinley knew he was on to something, so he did further testing with
      30 to 40 other seaweeds. That led him to a red seaweed
      Asparagopsis taxiformis he says reduces methane in cows burps and
      farts to almost nothing.<br>
      <br>
      "I was testing one day a series of samples when all of a sudden it
      looked like my instruments were having problems, and I wasn't able
      to see emissions from one particular sample," he said. "So I did
      it over and over again and lo and behold the methane emissions
      were eliminated.<br>
      <br>
      "That's when the light went on."<br>
      <br>
      The discovery, Kinley said, could be a "game changer" when it
      comes to global warming.<br>
      <br>
      "Ruminant animals are responsible for roughly 20 per cent of
      greenhouse gas emissions globally, so it's not a small number,"
      said Kinley, an agricultural research scientist now working at the
      Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation in
      Queensland, Australia.<br>
      <br>
      "We're talking numbers equivalent to hundreds of millions of
      cars."<br>
      <br>
      Kinley thinks it could take anywhere from three to five years to
      get a commercial animal feed to market. He says the biggest
      challenge will be growing enough seaweed.<br>
      <br>
      "Agriculture stands to be one of the first to make major changes
      in the greenhouse gas inventory and so it's really a game changer
      if we can get this out into the market."<br>

          <b>Method for reducing total gas production and/or methane
            production in a ruminant animal</b></big><br>
      </div>
      <b>Inventor: MACHADO LORENNA, et al</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [1] The present invention relates to a method of reducing total
      gas production and/or methane production in a ruminant animal.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      [2] Methane (CH4) is a greenhouse gas (GHG) produced primarily by
      methanogenic microbes that are found in natural ecosystems (e.g.
      wetlands, oceans and lakes) and the gastrointestinal tract of
      invertebrates and vertebrates, such as termites and ruminants.
      Every year -429-507 Tg of CH4are removed from the atmosphere and
      -40 Tg from the stratosphere through reactions with hydroxyl (OH)
      radicals; and -30 Tg by CH4-oxidizing bacteria in soil.<br>
      <br>
      [3] Nevertheless, anthropogenic GHG emissions have been increasing
      rapidly, with the CH4concentration in the atmosphere now more than
      twofold higher than in the early 1800s. Methane is very effective
      in absorbing solar infrared radiation and has a global warming
      potential 25 times greater than C02. Consequently, its
      accumulation in the atmosphere contributes considerably to climate
      change. One of the main sources of anthropogenic CH4can be
      attributed to agricultural activities, including ruminant
      livestock.<br>
      <br>
      [4] According to a recent UN report, cattle-rearing generates more
      global warming greenhouse gases, as measured in C02equivalent,
      than transportation. In Australia, ruminants are estimated to
      contribute -10% of the total GHG emissions. Ruminants produce
      CH4as a by-product of the anaerobic microbial fermentation of
      feeds in the rumen and, to a lesser extent, in the large
      intestine. The ruminal microbial community is highly diverse and
      composed of bacteria, protozoa, fungi, and bacteriophages that act
      collectively to ferment ingested organic matter (OM), resulting in
      C02, H2, volatile fatty acids (VFAs), and formates. Methanogenic
      archaea present in the rumen use these end-products and produce
      CH4. Although the production of CH4reduces the partial pressure of
      H2, which could otherwise inhibit rumen fermentation, it also
      reduces the amount of energy and carbon available for formation of
      VFAs essential for ruminant nutrition. Most of the CH4produced in
      ruminants is exhaled and belched by the animal and represents a
      loss of up to 12% of gross energy intake.<br>
      <br>
      [5] Mitigation strategies that reduce enteric CH4formation are
      important, and methods of reducing total gas production and/or
      methane production in ruminant animals represent a major
      challenge.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      [6] In one aspect, the present invention provides a method for
      reducing total gas production and/or methane production in a
      ruminant animal comprising the step of administering to said
      ruminant animal an effective amount of at least one species of red
      marine macroalgae.<br>
      <br>
      [7] In one embodiment the species of red marine macroalgae is an
      Asparagopsis species...<br>

      <div align="center"><big><b>Russia to make gold out of coal</b></big><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      The Russian experts have learnt how to make gold out of coal.
      Scientists of the Amur region developed an experimental device
      which is able of extracting up to 1g of the precious metal from a
      ton of the burnt fuel.<br>
      <br>
      The researchers have been studying composition of the coal from
      various fields for 15 years and found out that both useful and
      harmful components are deposited in filters.<br>
      <br>
      'In case the device entraps even a half - that is about half a
      gram per ton, the economic effect can be easily figured out. You
      burn a ton and get 1,500 roubles,' Oleg Ageev, Director General of
      the Complex Innovative Technologies of the Amur Scientific Centre,
      said.<br>
      <br>
      The principle is based on hundredfold clean-up system of smoke
      which occurs after combustion of the coal. Golden concentrate may
      be used later to produce gold. The method has been already
      patented. The Far Eastern scientists plan to use their device as
      early as in 2017.<br>
      <br>
      Now they intend to get a grant worth 1.5m roubles in Skolkovo for
      industrial mining of gold.<br>

      &nbsp;A method to stop aging may be one step closer to reality,
      after researchers developed a new way to remove cellular damage
      that accumulates as one gets older. It could slow or reverse one
      of the major causes of aging, and even help those with Parkinson’s
      disease.<br>
      <br>
      The study, conducted by researchers at the University of
      California Los Angeles and the California Institute of Technology,
      developed a new approach to remove mutated DNA from mitochondria,
      the small organelles that produce most of the chemical energy
      within a cell.<br>
      <br>
      Each cell in a person’s body has hundreds of thousands of
      mitochondria, each of which carries its own small circular DNA
      genome, called mtDNA. The products of mtDNA are essential for
      energy production.But because mtDNA has limited repair abilities,
      both normal and mutant versions of it are often found in the same
      cell – a condition known as heteroplasmy.<br>
      <br>
      Mutant mtDNA over a person’s lifetime is thought to be a main
      contributor to aging. It is also thought to contribute to
      degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s and
      sarcopenia.<br>
      <br>
      “We know that increased rates of mtDNA mutation cause premature
      aging,” study author Bruce Hay, a Caltech professor of biology and
      biological engineering, said in a statement.<br>
      <br>
      “This, coupled with the fact that mutant mtDNA accumulates in key
      tissues such as neurons and muscle that lose function as we age,
      suggests that if we could reduce the amount of mutant mtDNA, we
      could slow or reverse important aspects of aging,” Hay added.<br>
      <br>
      To test the theory, Hay and his colleagues genetically engineered
      Drosophila, the common fruit fly, so that about 75 percent of its
      mtDNA in muscles required for flight – one of the most energy
      demanding tissues in the animal kingdom – underwent mutation in
      early adulthood.<br>
      <br>
      When the team artificially increased the activity of genes that
      promote mitophagy – the process of cells breaking down and
      removing dysfunctional mitochondria – they found that the fraction
      of mutated mtDNA in the fly muscle cells was drastically reduced.<br>
      <br>
      “Such a decrease would completely eliminate any metabolic defects
      in these cells, essentially restoring them to a more youthful,
      energy-producing state,” Hay said.<br>
      <br>
      “The experiments serve as a clear demonstration that the level of
      mutant mtDNA can be reduced in cells by gently tweaking normal
      cellular processes,” he added.<br>
      <br>
      The successful process of mitophagy was particularly significant
      for the researchers, as it was previously unclear whether the
      process could promote the selective elimination of mtDNA.<br>
      <br>
      In addition to potentially combating the aging process, the team’s
      finding could have huge implications for Parkinson’s disease. When
      the team over-expressed the gene parkin – which is known to
      promote the removal of dysfunctional mitocondria and is mutated in
      familial forms of Parkinson's disease – the fraction of mutant
      mtDNA was reduced from 76 percent to five percent. Over-expression
      of the gene Atg1 reduced the fraction to four percent.<br>
      <br>
      Hay said the team's next step will be to build on the knowledge
      that mtDNA quality control exists and can be enhanced, by
      searching for drugs that can achieve the same effects.<br>
      <br>
      “Our goal is to create a future in which we can periodically
      undergo a cellular housecleaning to remove damaged mtDNA from the
      brain, muscle, and other tissues. This will help us maintain our
      intellectual abilities, mobility, and support healthy aging more
      generally,” Hay concluded.<br>

      </b><b>Abstract</b><br>
      <br>
      Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) often exists in a state of heteroplasmy,
      in which mutant mtDNA co-exists in cells with wild-type mtDNA.
      High frequencies of pathogenic mtDNA result in maternally
      inherited diseases; maternally and somatically acquired mutations
      also accumulate over time and contribute to diseases of ageing.
      Reducing heteroplasmy is therefore a therapeutic goal and in vivo
      models in post-mitotic tissues are needed to facilitate these
      studies. Here we describe a transgene-based model of a
      heteroplasmic lethal mtDNA deletion (mtDNA?) in adult Drosophila
      muscle. Stimulation of autophagy, activation of the PINK1/parkin
      pathway or decreased levels of mitofusin result in a selective
      decrease in mtDNA?. Decreased levels of mitofusin and increased
      levels of ATPIF1, an inhibitor of ATP synthase reversal-dependent
      mitochondrial repolarization, result in a further decrease in
      mtDNA? levels. These results show that an adult post-mitotic
      tissue can be cleansed of a deleterious genome, suggesting that
      therapeutic removal of mutant mtDNA can be achieved.<br>

      ...‘EMP is very lethal to electronic equipment,’ said Christopher
      Tuan, professor of civil engineering. We found a key ingredient
      that dissipates wave energy. 'This technology offers a lot of
      advantages so the construction industry is very interested.’ The
      researchers created a concrete that conducts electricity,
      replacing some of the standard concrete materials with magnetite.<br>
      <br>
      This mineral has magnetic properties, and can absorb microwaves.
      The concrete also includes carbon and metal components, enhancing
      its absorbing abilities and allowing it to reflect as well.
      According to the researchers, this method is far more effective
      than standard shielding technologies, which rely on metal
      enclosures with expensive panels or screens.<br>
      <br>
      The new concrete is now available for commercialization, and the
      team has joined with ABC Group in a research agreement for a new
      patent-pending pending product that would work with a shotcrete
      construction method, a spray-on technique that would allow for
      cost-effective retrofitting. This would protect building interiors
      from electromagnetic interference, such as radio waves and
      microwaves, and electronic eavesdropping. According to the
      researchers, it could be used to make military, financial, and
      other important structures much safer.<br>
      <br>
      The missile is equipped with an electromagnetic pulse cannon. This
      uses a super-powerful microwave oven to generate a concentrated
      beam of energy. The energy causes voltage surges in electronic
      equipment, rendering them useless before surge protectors have the
      chance to react. In 2015, the US Air Force claims it has advanced
      the technology, and says it can deploy it using the stealthy Joint
      Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile-Extended Range (JASSM).<br>
      <br>
      And before this, in 2012, aircraft manufacturer Boeing
      successfully tested the weapon on a one-hour flight during which
      it knocked out the computers of an entire military compound.
      During Boeing's experiment, the missile flew low over the Utah
      Test and Training Range, discharging electromagnetic pulses on to
      seven targets, permanently shutting down their electronics. Boeing
      said that the test was so successful even the camera recording it
      was disabled. - Conductive concrete that can protect buildings

      <b>BACKGROUND</b><br>
      <br>
      An Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP) is an abrupt pulse or burst of
      electromagnetic (EM) radiation that typically results from a high
      energy explosion (e.g., a nuclear explosion) or from a suddenly
      fluctuating magnetic field, such as a magnetic field generated by
      a solar flare or coronal mass ejection (CME). An EMP creates
      rapidly changing electric fields and magnetic fields, which may
      couple with electrical and electronic systems, resulting in
      damaging current and voltage surges. For example, a High-altitude
      Electromagnetic Pulse (HEMP) is produced when a nuclear weapon is
      detonated high above the Earth's surface, generating gamma
      radiation that ionizes the atmosphere and creates an instantaneous
      and intense EM field. The effects of a HEMP vary depending on a
      number of factors, including detonation altitude, energy yield,
      gamma ray output, interactions with the Earth's magnetic field,
      shielding effectiveness of targets, and so forth. As the EM field
      of a HEMP radiates outward, it can overload electronic devices and
      equipment with effects similar to (but causing damage more quickly
      than) a lightning strike. EMP weapons have also been developed
      that can be mounted on aircraft and carried by ground vehicles.<br>

      Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key features
      or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it
      intended to be used as an aid in determining the scope of the

      <br>
      <b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>Overview</b><br>
      <br>
      EMP protection is desirable for facilities and infrastructure
      employed for critical services, such as Command and Control
      (C&lt;2&gt;), Command and Control Information Systems
      (C&lt;2&gt;IS), Command, Control, Communications, Computers,
      Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C&lt;4&gt;ISR),
      financial institutions, and so forth. For example, the military is
      concerned with ensuring that military commanders have the ability
      to direct forces, while financial institutions are concerned with
      protecting computer networks and databases crucial to electronic
      business (e-business). Thus, critical facilities and
      infrastructure are typically protected from EMP's by shielding and
      grounding building structures using a shielded enclosure or
      Faraday cage around a facility. For example, a Faraday cage can be
      formed as an enclosure using metallic conducting material (e.g.,
      solid steel panels) or a mesh of conducting material (e.g., copper
      wire screen) surrounding a facility. However, such shielding must
      be constructed in addition to the facility itself, adding to the
      cost and complexity of providing EMP protection.<br>
      <br>
      Accordingly, the present disclosure is directed to a conductive
      concrete building material that can provide built-in shielding
      against EMP, as well as EM field immunity and radiated emission
      security. For example, while concrete with embedded steel rebar
      can provide some magnetic shielding, a conductive concrete
      enclosure configured in accordance with the present disclosure can
      provide effective global shielding at frequencies of interest.
      Further, conductive concrete walls can also provide grounding and
      lightning protection, and conduct the energy of EMP induced
      current, which would otherwise be conducted in wires and other
      conductors within a structure. Additionally, use of the conductive
      concrete material may provide a more cost-effective building
      option (e.g., instead of constructing separate shielding in the
      manner of a Faraday cage).<br>
      <br>
      In implementations, the conductive concrete mixture may include
      one or more magnetic materials, such as ferromagnetic material,
      paramagnetic material, and so forth, which serve to provide EMP
      shielding and absorb, for instance, EM waves propagating through
      the conductive concrete mixture. For example, in a specific
      instance, the conductive concrete mixture includes a taconite rock
      material that comprises magnetite, such as a taconite aggregate.
      However, taconite aggregate is provided by way of example only and
      is not meant to be restrictive of the present disclosure. Thus, in
      other implementations, the conductive concrete mixture may include
      other materials, such as, but not necessarily limited to: natural
      geological materials, mineral materials, and so forth. For
      example, the conductive concrete mixture may include meteoric iron
      (e.g., iron from nickel-iron meteorites) having kamacite and/or
      taenite minerals. The conductive concrete mixture may also include
      magnetite crystals produced by bacteria and/or magnetite collected
      from river or beach sands. Further, the conductive concrete
      mixture may include titanohematite and/or pyrrhotite (which may be
      ground into a powder). In still further instances, the conductive
      concrete mixture may include a paramagnetic mineral, such as
      ilmenite, titanomagnetite, and so forth.<br>
      <br>
      The conductive concrete mixture also includes one or more
      conductive materials configured to furnish electrical conductivity
      to the concrete. The conductive material serves to provide EMP
      shielding and reflect and absorb, for instance, EM waves
      propagating through the conductive concrete mixture. For example,
      the conductive concrete mixture may include at least substantially
      uniformly distributed conductive materials, which may include
      metallic and possibly non-metallic conductive materials, such as
      metal and/or carbon fibers. In implementations, the metallic
      conductive material may serve to reflect EM waves, while the
      non-metallic conductive material may serve to absorb EM waves. For
      the purposes of the present disclosure, a conductive concrete
      mixture may be defined as a cement-based admixture containing
      electrically conductive components that furnish a relatively high
      electrical conductivity to the concrete (e.g., with respect to the
      electrical conductivity of typical concrete). The conductive
      concrete mixture may also include conductive carbon particles,
      such as carbon powder, and so forth, which may furnish better
      electrically conductive paths between portions of the conductive
      material, achieving, for instance, a more effective
      reflective-wire-mesh structure in the concrete.<br>
      <br>
      In implementations, the conductive concrete mixture includes a
      metallic conductive material. For example, the metallic conductive
      material may be a steel material, such as one inch (1 in.) long
      steel fibers, one and one-half inch (1.5 in.) long steel fibers,
      fine steel fibers, steel wool fibers, steel powder, and so forth.
      In a particular instance, low-carbon steel fibers having aspect
      ratios from about eighteen to fifty-three (18-53) can be used to
      form the conductive concrete mixture. These fibers may be
      rectangular in shape and may have a deformed or corrugated surface
      to aid in bonding with the concrete material. However, steel
      fibers are provided by way of example only and are not meant to be
      restrictive of the present disclosure. Thus, other metallic
      conductive materials may also be utilized, including metal
      particles such as steel shavings, which may have varying
      diameters. Further, the conductive concrete mixture may include
      conductive aggregates, such as iron ore and/or slag. In some
      instances, copper-rich aggregates can be used. It should be noted
      that using conductive aggregates may reduce the amount of
      conductive fibers necessary to maintain stable electrical
      conductivity. Additionally, a chemical admixture may be added to
      the aggregate to enhance electrical conductivity and reduce the
      amount of conductive fibers.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example Implementations</b><br>
      <br>
      One-quarter inch (0.25 in.) thick test specimens made of cement,
      carbon powder, and very fine steel fibers were evaluated according
      to the ASTM-4935-99 Shielding Effectiveness (SE) test fixture. The
      measurements of the reference and load specimens were obtained
      using a radio frequency (RF) network analyzer. SE has been
      determined as the difference in decibels (dB) between the
      insertion loss measurements of the reference and load reference
      specimens. The results showed an SE better than sixty decibels (60
      dB) at three hundred kilohertz (300 kHz) that decreased at ten
      decibels (10 dB) per decade frequency to about thirty decibels (30
      dB) at three hundred megahertz (300 MHz), before improving at
      about ten decibels (10 dB) per decade above three hundred (300
      MHz). This frequency response suggests that the SE is due to both
      reflection (e.g., at low frequency) and absorption (e.g., at high
      frequency).<br>
      <br>
      One-quarter inch (0.25 in.) thick test specimens made of typical
      cement were also evaluated according to the ASTM-4935-99 SE test
      fixture. Measurements with the RF network analyzer showed an
      average SE of less than five decibels (5 dB) over the frequency
      range from three-tenths megahertz (0.3 MHz) to three gigahertz (3
      GHz). Thus, it may be seen that the cement-only specimens provide
      essentially no shielding between one megahertz (1 MHz) and one
      hundred megahertz (100 MHz). In comparison, specimens that are of
      the same thickness but contain fine steel fibers and carbon powder
      may yield SE better than thirty decibels (30 dB) over the same
      frequency range. The comparative results of these two sample
      mixtures indicate the application of conductive concrete for
      providing electromagnetic shielding of structures. Further, the
      measurements from cement-only specimens can be used to provide
      baseline SE results for further comparison with other conductive
      mix designs at various thicknesses.<br>
      <br>
      One-quarter inch (0.25 in.) thick specimens containing cement,
      taconite powder, and fine steel fibers were evaluated according to
      the ASTM-4935-99 SE test fixture. Measurements with the RF network
      analyzer showed a low frequency SE of nearly fifteen decibels (15
      dB) from three-tenths megahertz (0.3 MHz) to twenty megahertz (20
      MHz) that increased to about twenty-five decibels (25 dB) between
      two hundred megahertz (200 MHz) and seven hundred megahertz (700
      MHz). The SE improved at sixty decibels (60 dB) per decade in the
      microwave frequency range and reached greater than fifty decibels
      (50 dB) at two gigahertz (2 GHz). Thus, it may be seen that the
      taconite and steel fiber concrete mixture possesses superior SE
      characteristics compared to the cement-only mixture as described
      above. It should be noted that the lesser SE of this mixture at
      low frequency as compared to the carbon powder and fine steel
      fiber specimens may be attributable to the role of carbon powder
      versus taconite in providing electrically conductive paths between
      random steel fibers to achieve a more effective, reflective wire
      mesh-like structure in the concrete. The SE improvement in the
      microwave frequency range in the same comparison demonstrates the
      enhanced effectiveness of taconites as microwave absorbing
      aggregates. These results also show that the taconite specimens
      can absorb some electromagnetic energy at lower frequency,
      indicating that the conductive concrete mixture can also provide
      low frequency magnetic shielding.<br>

      mechanical strength characteristics such as a twenty-eight (28)
      day compressive strength ranging from about four thousand five
      hundred to seven thousand pounds per square inch (4,500-7,000
      psi), and a flexural strength ranging from about nine hundred to
      one thousand five hundred pounds per square inch (900-1,500 psi).
      In implementations, the purity of the conductive carbon particles
      and graphite particles is at least ninety-six percent (96%). It
      should be noted that the specific amounts described above are
      provided by way of example only and are not meant to be
      restrictive of the present disclosure. Thus, other amounts of
      material may be used for a specified SE in accordance with the
      present disclosure. For example, cement may comprise from about
      eighteen to twenty-one percent (18-21%) of the conductive concrete
      mixture by weight; silica fume may comprise from about nine-tenths
      to one and one-tenth percent (0.9-1.1%) of the conductive concrete
      mixture by weight; fine aggregate/sand may comprise from about
      eighteen to twenty and one-tenth percent (18-20.1%) of the
      conductive concrete mixture by weight; taconite aggregate may
      comprise from about twenty to twenty-five percent (20-25%) of the
      conductive concrete mixture by weight; conductive carbon particles
      may comprise from about twelve and one-half to sixteen percent
      (12.5-16%) of the conductive concrete mixture by weight; graphite
      powder may comprise from about nine-tenths to one and two-tenths
      percent (0.9-1.2%) of the conductive concrete mixture by weight;
      water may comprise from about nine to ten and one-half percent
      (9-10.5%) of the conductive concrete mixture by weight; steel
      fibers may comprise from about one to seven percent (1-7%) of the
      conductive concrete mixture by weight; and superplasticizer may
      comprise from about three-tenths to four-tenths percent (0.3-0.4%)
      of the conductive concrete mixture by weight.<br>
      <br>
      Further, the amounts of materials having different particle sizes
      may vary as well. For example, in implementations, conductive
      carbon particles having a maximum particle size of seven-tenths of
      a millimeter (0.7 mm) may comprise from about one-half to two
      percent (0.5-2%) of the conductive concrete mixture by weight;
      conductive carbon particles having a maximum particle size of two
      millimeters (2 mm) may comprise from about two to six percent
      (2-6%) of the conductive concrete mixture by weight; conductive
      carbon particles having a maximum particle size of ten millimeters
      (10 mm) may comprise from about seven to fourteen percent (7-14%)
      of the conductive concrete mixture by weight; graphite powder
      having a maximum particle size of fifteen-one-hundredths of a
      millimeter (0.15 mm) may comprise from about one to one and
      one-half percent (1-1.5%) of the conductive concrete mixture by
      weight; one inch (1 in.) long steel fibers may comprise from about
      three to three and three-tenths percent (3.0-3.3%) of the
      conductive concrete mixture by weight; one-half inch (1.5 in.)
      long steel fibers may comprise from about two and one-half to
      three percent (2.5-3%) of the conductive concrete mixture by
      weight; and fine steel fiber may comprise from about zero to two
      percent (0-2%) of the conductive concrete mixture by weight.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example Process</b><br>
      <br>
      Referring now to FIG. 4, example techniques for making a
      conductive concrete mixture are described. FIG. 4 depicts a
      process 400, in an example implementation, for making a conductive
      concrete mixture using, for instance, metallic conductive
      material, conductive carbon particles, and magnetic material, such
      as taconite aggregate, as described above.<br>
      <br>
      In the process 400 illustrated, conductive carbon particles,
      graphite powder, aggregate, such as sand and gravel, and fine
      steel fibers are blended to form a dry mix (Block 410). In
      implementations, the materials may be blended in a container such
      as the drum of a concrete truck mixer, and so forth. However, a
      concrete truck mixer is provided by way of example only, and other
      containers for mixing concrete may also be used. In a specific
      instance, the materials of the dry mix are mixed for at least five
      (5) minutes. Next, cement (e.g., Type I cement), water, and a
      magnetic material, such as crushed taconite aggregate, are added
      to the dry mix to form a wet mix (Block 420). Silica fume, other
      SCM, and/or an admixture, such as superplasticizer (water
      reducer/High Range Water Reducer (HRWR)) can also be added to the
      wet mix. In implementations, the wet mix is formed at the concrete
      truck.<br>
      <br>
      Then, metallic conductive material, such as steel fiber, is added
      to the wet mix (Block 430). For example, steel fibers can be added
      in the truck mixer using, for instance, a conveyor (e.g., conveyor
      belt) extending into the truck mixer. In implementations, the
      steel fibers are spread out to at least substantially uniformly
      distribute the steel fibers on the conveyor (e.g., to avoid
      flocculation or balling of the steel fibers). For example, the
      steel fibers can be placed on a conveyor belt by hand. Next,
      conductive material, such as one inch (1 in.) long steel fibers,
      and one and one-half inch (1.5 in.) long steel fibers, is mixed
      with the wet mix to form a conductive concrete mixture (Block
      440).<br>
      <br>
      It should be noted that while process 400 describes adding the
      metallic conductive material to the wet concrete mixture, the
      metallic conductive material may be added during the mixing of
      cement and/or aggregate in either wet or dry conditions. Further,
      it is desirable to maintain at least substantially uniform
      disbursement of the metallic conductive material during mixing.
      Thus, mixing may be performed according to guidelines specified
      by, for example, American Concrete Institute (ACI) Committee 544
      for mixing steel fibers. U.S. Pat. No. 6,825,444, issued Nov. 30,
      2004, entitled “Heated Bridge Deck System and Materials and Method
      for Constructing the Same” includes example mixing procedures that
      can be used with the conductive concrete mixture of the present
      disclosure and is incorporated herein by reference in its
      entirety.<br>

      We examine the hypothesis that consciousness can be understood as
      a state of matter, "perceptronium", with distinctive information
      processing abilities. We explore five basic principles that may
      distinguish conscious matter from other physical systems such as
      solids, liquids and gases: the information, integration,
      independence, dynamics and utility principles. If such principles
      can identify conscious entities, then they can help solve the
      quantum factorization problem: why do conscious observers like us
      perceive the particular Hilbert space factorization corresponding
      to classical space (rather than Fourier space, say), and more
      generally, why do we perceive the world around us as a dynamic
      hierarchy of objects that are strongly integrated and relatively
      independent? Tensor factorization of matrices is found to play a
      central role, and our technical results include a theorem about
      Hamiltonian separability (defined using Hilbert-Schmidt
      superoperators) being maximized in the energy eigenbasis. Our
      approach generalizes Giulio Tononi's integrated information
      framework for neural-network-based consciousness to arbitrary
      quantum systems, and we find interesting links to error-correcting
      codes, condensed matter criticality, and the Quantum Darwinism
      program, as well as an interesting connection between the
      emergence of consciousness and the emergence of time. <br>

      </b><i>Most diet soda drinks contain aspartame, an artificial
        sweetener</i><i><br>
      </i><i>When aspartame is ingested it releases a product called
        phenylalanine </i><i><br>
      </i><i>This disrupts an enzyme which is key for smooth-running
        metabolism</i><i><br>
      </i><i>Researchers found this process prevents weight loss, and
        can even cause weight gain </i><br>
      <br>
      Diet sodas prevent you from losing weight, a new study claims.<br>
      <br>
      Low-calorie versions of sugary drinks attract millions of people
      looking to shed a few pounds.<br>
      <br>
      But according to research by Massachusetts General Hospital, all
      those good intentions are derailed by the sweetener aspartame,
      which disrupts metabolism.<br>
      <br>
      In fact, they found that aspartame can actually <br>
      <br>
      Testing in mice, they found aspartame contains a product called
      phenylalanine which disrupts an enzyme, similarly to a condition
      seen in people with type 2 diabetes or heart disease.<br>
      <br>
      The enzyme is key to preventing metabolic disorders.<br>
      <br>
      The researchers also found that mice with aspartame in their
      drinking water gained more weight and developed more issues with
      metabolism than those that didn't. <br>
      <br>
      'Sugar substitutes like aspartame are designed to promote weight
      loss and decrease the incidence of metabolic syndrome, but a
      number of clinical and epidemiologic studies have suggested that
      these products don't work very well and may actually make things
      worse,' the report's senior author Dr Richard Hodin said. <br>
      <br>
      'We found that aspartame blocks a gut enzyme called intestinal
      alkaline phosphatase (IAP) that we previously showed can prevent
      obesity, diabetes and metabolic syndrome.<br>
      <br>
      'So we think that aspartame might not work because, even as it is
      substituting for sugar, it blocks the beneficial aspects of IAP.'<br>
      <br>
      The study follows on from Dr Hodin's 2013 research, which found
      that feeding IAP to mice kept on a high-fat diet could prevent the
      development of metabolic syndrome.<br>
      <br>
      IAP was also found to reduce symptoms in animals that already had
      the condition. <br>
      <br>
      Previous studies had already showed that phenylalanine inhibit
      IAP.<br>
      <br>
      Given that phenylalanine is produced when aspartame is digested,
      Dr Hodin, a Harvard professor, decided to investigate aspartame
      itself. <br>
      <br>
      The experiment was designed to mimic actual diet sodas.<br>
      <br>
      To accurately represent the effects of aspartame-containing
      drinks, the researchers followed four groups of mice for 18 weeks.
      <br>
      <br>
      Two groups were fed a normal diet, one receiving drinking water
      with aspartame, the other receiving plain water. <br>
      <br>
      The other two groups were fed a high-fat diet, along with either
      aspartame-infused or plain water. <br>
      <br>
      Animals in the normal diet group that received aspartame consumed
      an amount equivalent to an adult human's drinking about three and
      a half cans of diet soda daily, and aspartame-receiving animals in
      the high-fat group consumed the equivalent of almost two cans.<br>
      <br>
      At the end of the study period, while there was little difference
      between the weights of the two groups fed a normal diet, mice on a
      high-fat diet that received aspartame gained more weight than did
      those on the same diet that received plain water. <br>
      <br>
      Aspartame-receiving mice in both diet groups had higher blood
      sugar levels than did those fed the same diets without aspartame.<br>
      <br>
      Both aspartame-receiving groups had higher levels of inflammation.
      <br>
      <br>
      'People do not really understand why these artificial sweeteners
      don't work. <br>
      <br>
      'There has been some evidence that they actually can make you more
      hungry and may be associated with increased calorie consumption. <br>
      <br>
      'Our findings regarding aspartame's inhibition of IAP may help
      explain why the use of aspartame is counterproductive.<br>
      <br>
      'While we can't rule out other contributing mechanisms, our
      experiments clearly show that aspartame blocks IAP activity,
      independent of other effects.'<br>
      <br>
      The British Soft Drinks Association hit back at the paper,
      claiming it to be baseless.<br>
      <br>
      Gavin Partington, BSDA Director General, said: 'These claims are
      being made by a study conducted on mice and run contrary to the
      overwhelming body of scientific evidence. <br>
      <br>
      Decades of scientific research, including human clinical trials,
      show that low-calorie sweeteners, such as those in diet drinks,
      have been found to help consumers manage their calorie intake when
      part of an overall healthy diet.'<br>

            UCF scientists bring it closer to reality with flexible

      <br>
      A team of UCF scientists has developed a new process for creating
      flexible supercapacitors that can store more energy and be
      recharged more than 30,000 times without degrading.<br>
      <br>
      The novel method from the University of Central Florida's
      NanoScience Technology Center could eventually revolutionize
      technology as varied as mobile phones and electric vehicles.<br>
      <br>
      "If they were to replace the batteries with these supercapacitors,
      you could charge your mobile phone in a few seconds and you
      wouldn't need to charge it again for over a week," said Nitin
      Choudhary, a postdoctoral associate who conducted much of the
      research published recently in the academic journal ACS Nano.<br>
      <br>
      Anyone with a smartphone knows the problem: After 18 months or so,
      it holds a charge for less and less time as the battery begins to
      degrade.<br>
      <br>
      Scientists have been studying the use of nanomaterials to improve
      supercapacitors that could enhance or even replace batteries in
      electronic devices. It's a stubborn problem, because a
      supercapacitor that held as much energy as a lithium-ion battery
      would have to be much, much larger.<br>
      <br>
      The team at UCF has experimented with applying newly discovered
      two-dimensional materials only a few atoms thick to
      supercapacitors. Other researchers have also tried formulations
      with graphene and other two-dimensional materials, but with
      limited success.<br>
      <br>
      "There have been problems in the way people incorporate these
      two-dimensional materials into the existing systems - that's been
      a bottleneck in the field. We developed a simple chemical
      synthesis approach so we can very nicely integrate the existing
      materials with the two-dimensional materials," said principal
      investigator Yeonwoong "Eric" Jung, an assistant professor with
      joint appointments to the NanoScience Technology Center and the
      Materials Science &amp; Engineering Department.<br>
      <br>
      Jung's team has developed supercapacitors composed of millions of
      nanometer-thick wires coated with shells of two-dimensional
      materials. A highly conductive core facilitates fast electron
      transfer for fast charging and discharging. And uniformly coated
      shells of two-dimensional materials yield high energy and power
      densities.<br>
      <br>
      Scientists already knew two-dimensional materials held great
      promise for energy storage applications. But until the
      UCF-developed process for integrating those materials, there was
      no way to realize that potential, Jung said.<br>
      <br>
      "For small electronic devices, our materials are surpassing the
      conventional ones worldwide in terms of energy density, power
      density and cyclic stability," Choudhary said.<br>
      <br>
      Cyclic stability defines how many times it can be charged, drained
      and recharged before beginning to degrade. For example, a
      lithium-ion battery can be recharged fewer than 1,500 times
      without significant failure. Recent formulations of
      supercapacitors with two-dimensional materials can be recharged a
      few thousand times.<br>
      <br>
      By comparison, the new process created at UCF yields a
      supercapacitor that doesn't degrade even after it's been recharged
      30,000 times.<br>
      <br>
      Jung is working with UCF's Office of Technology Transfer to patent
      the new process.<br>
      <br>
      Supercapacitors that use the new materials could be used in phones
      and other electronic gadgets, and electric vehicles that could
      benefit from sudden bursts of power and speed. And because they're
      flexible, it could mean a significant advancement in wearable
      tech, as well.<br>
      <br>
      "It's not ready for commercialization," Jung said. "But this is a
      proof-of-concept demonstration, and our studies show there are
      very high impacts for many technologies."<br>

      Two-dimensional (2D) transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have
      emerged as promising capacitive materials for supercapacitor
      devices owing to their intrinsically layered structure and large
      surface areas. Hierarchically integrating 2D TMDs with other
      functional nanomaterials has recently been pursued to improve
      electrochemical performances; however, it often suffers from
      limited cyclic stabilities and capacitance losses due to the poor
      structural integrity at the interfaces of randomly assembled
      materials. Here, we report high-performance core/shell nanowire
      supercapacitors based on an array of one-dimensional (1D)
      nanowires seamlessly integrated with conformal 2D TMD layers. The
      1D and 2D supercapacitor components possess “one-body” geometry
      with atomically sharp and structurally robust core/shell
      interfaces, as they were spontaneously converted from identical
      metal current collectors via sequential oxidation/sulfurization.
      These hybrid supercapacitors outperform previously developed any
      stand-alone 2D TMD-based supercapacitors; particularly, exhibiting
      an exceptional charge–discharge retention over 30,000 cycles owing
      to their structural robustness, suggesting great potential for
      unconventional energy storage technologies.<br>

      </div>
      <br>
      Cataract sufferers may soon be able to replace costly and
      dangerous surgery with eye drops to restore their sight, an
      international research team has found.<br>
      <br>
      Cataracts are caused by a build-up of protein on the lens, turning
      it opaque. Currently, the only treatment is surgery, which is not
      readily available in developing countries. This lack of access had
      led to cataracts becoming the most common cause of blindness
      worldwide.<br>
      <br>
      In a study published in Nature, a team including researchers from
      Sichuan University, found that children born with cataracts were
      unable to produce lanosterol, a steroid naturally occurring in the
      lens, which is responsible for breaking protein clumps apart.<br>
      <br>
      In the lab, the team found that treatment with a lanosterol
      solution broke apart the protein clumps and increased lens
      transparency. By administering lanosterol eye drops in vivo to
      dogs the team were able to successfully reduce the size and
      severity of cataracts.<br>
      <br>
      The team believes their study “points to a novel strategy for
      cataract prevention and treatment.”<br>

      The human lens is comprised largely of crystallin proteins
      assembled into a highly ordered, interactive macro-structure
      essential for lens transparency and refractive index. Any
      disruption of intra- or inter-protein interactions will alter this
      delicate structure, exposing hydrophobic surfaces, with consequent
      protein aggregation and cataract formation. Cataracts are the most
      common cause of blindness worldwide, affecting tens of millions of
      people1, and currently the only treatment is surgical removal of
      cataractous lenses. The precise mechanisms by which lens proteins
      both prevent aggregation and maintain lens transparency are
      largely unknown. Lanosterol is an amphipathic molecule enriched in
      the lens. It is synthesized by lanosterol synthase (LSS) in a key
      cyclization reaction of a cholesterol synthesis pathway. Here we
      identify two distinct homozygous LSS missense mutations (W581R and
      G588S) in two families with extensive congenital cataracts. Both
      of these mutations affect highly conserved amino acid residues and
      impair key catalytic functions of LSS. Engineered expression of
      wild-type, but not mutant, LSS prevents intracellular protein
      aggregation of various cataract-causing mutant crystallins.
      Treatment by lanosterol, but not cholesterol, significantly
      decreased preformed protein aggregates both in vitro and in
      cell-transfection experiments. We further show that lanosterol
      treatment could reduce cataract severity and increase transparency
      in dissected rabbit cataractous lenses in vitro and cataract
      severity in vivo in dogs. Our study identifies lanosterol as a key
      molecule in the prevention of lens protein aggregation and points
      to a novel strategy for cataract prevention and treatment.<br>

      mechanism...<br>
      <br>
      Saffron demonstrated significant protection against
      selenite-induced cataractogenesis in vivo. The mean activities of
      superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, catalase, and
      glutathione levels were significantly increased in group III

      prevented selenite-induced lipid peroxidation, protein oxidation,
      and proteolysis and insolubilization of the lens WSF.<br>
      CONCLUSIONS:<br>
      <br>
      Saffron extract prevented selenite-induced cataract formation in
      Wistar rats, possibly through the reinforcement of antioxidant
      status, reduction of the intensity of lipid peroxidation,
      protection of the sulfhydryl groups, and inhibition of proteolysis
      of the lens WSF. These findings highlight the anticataractogenic

      </b><br>
      The repair and regeneration of tissues using endogenous stem cells
      represents an ultimate goal in regenerative medicine. To our
      knowledge, human lens regeneration has not yet been demonstrated.
      Currently, the only treatment for cataracts, the leading cause of
      blindness worldwide, is to extract the cataractous lens and
      implant an artificial intraocular lens. However, this procedure
      poses notable risks of complications. Here we isolate lens
      epithelial stem/progenitor cells (LECs) in mammals and show that
      Pax6 and Bmi1 are required for LEC renewal. We design a surgical
      method of cataract removal that preserves endogenous LECs and
      achieves functional lens regeneration in rabbits and macaques, as
      well as in human infants with cataracts. Our method differs
      conceptually from current practice, as it preserves endogenous
      LECs and their natural environment maximally, and regenerates
      lenses with visual function. Our approach demonstrates a novel
      treatment strategy for cataracts and provides a new paradigm for
      tissue regeneration using endogenous stem cells.<br>

      treatment has major benefits, not just for those infected but also
      for public health in general by reducing HIV transmission.<br>
      <br>
      "The single biggest thing that we can do to have a major impact on
      the HIV epidemic is to dramatically increase HIV testing rates,
      especially in those most at risk. The availability of HIV
      self-testing will help us achieve that."<br>
      <br>
      Kat Smithson, campaigns manager at the National Aids Trust, also
      welcomed the development.<br>
      <br>
      She told Sky News: "There are a lot of people who are unaware of
      their HIV status who may be uncomfortable with accessing HIV
      testing in clinical settings or who don't know how to. <br>
      <br>
      "It also enables a lot of people who think they might be at
      increased risk of HIV to test more often."<br>

          ADHD Symptoms Developed</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      ScienceDaily (Nov. 14, 2007) — Scientists at John Carroll
      University, working in its Lighting Innovations Institute, have
      developed an affordable accessory that appears to reduce the
      symptoms of ADHD. Their discovery also has also been shown to
      improve sleep patterns among people who have difficulty falling
      asleep. The John Carroll researchers have created glasses designed
      to block blue light, therefore altering a person's circadian
      rhythm, which leads to improvement in ADHD symptoms and sleep
      disorders.<br>

      ABSTRACT: The Trion-Re' is a fundamental structural unit of 3-D
      space on the basis of which a new geometry of 3-D space can be
      built: namely, the 3-D space in which no straight lines exist. To
      account for the curvature of space, this modification shifts the
      rules for a platonic solid, making the Trion-Re’ the sixth such
      regular solid and a unique structure of space/time. Traditionally,
      there are five Platonic Solids with congruent angles and equal,
      flat faces. However, we must modify the rule and include curved
      surfaces; in which case a new solid emerges more rudimentary than
      the tetrahedron. Henceforth called the Trion-Re’, this new solid
      is described as follows: 2-vertices, 3-flexible edges, 3-equal
      faces, an inside and an outside and spin ability. The Trion-Re’
      can be used to generate new versions of the other five Platonic
      Solids.<br>
      <br>
      In this formal proposal the Platonic Solids are categorically
      being extended from five to six in number, yielding possibly the
      most basic structure of space/time, a dynamic three-sided object
      that is totally closed and considered characteristically
      unique.&nbsp; The 5-regular polyhedra are composed of equal line
      segments and have all equal faces and angles.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of
      these regular polyhedra composed of identical line segments, the
      Trion-Re’ is the sixth, with the 3-D line segment composing the
      other polyhedra. If we modify Euler's rule and include curved
      surfaces, a new solid emerges more rudimentary than the
      tetrahedron...<br>

      <b>Space Clusters</b><br>
      <br>
      Space Clusters is a series of struts and intersections that
      assemble easily and form three dimensional constructions without
      glue. Space Clusters was patented by Michael Evans in 1972 and it
      was sold in every major museum and planetarium in the US.<br>

      The Micky Ball is a model view of the twenty-dimensional path of
      the ultimate, indivisible unit of matter. Light itself. A single
      ray of light which can be described as follows: three- identical
      faces, 3-edges, 2 vertices, an inside and outside, occupies space
      has spin ability and flexibility. I call this structure a “TRION
      RE”. The Polynesians may have called it a “Star Seed”. Leon
      Lederman, the noted physicist, might have called it" The God
      Particle".<br>
      <br>
      The “SPACE CLUSTER” theory is based on three simple principles: No
      straight lines, from the one comes the many and light is a regular
      solid. Not only is it a regular solid it is the basic building
      block of the universe and follows a self organizing topology. It
      is my theory that within every individual ray of light, is life
      itself. It is the conduit of all things living and material. It is
      in the path and matrix, of light where the secrets of the universe
      may be found. Light connects us all.<br>

      SPACE CLUSTERS KIT Space Cluster kits provide an unique
      construction tool to create 3-Dimensional geometric structures.
      Space Clusters are held together with special connectors that
      require no scissors or glue, so they may be use d again and again.<br>
      <br>
      SPACE CLUSTERS are an excellent education tool for children ages 7
      and older. The kits initiate structural geometry, encourage 3-D
      thinking, provide manipulative dexterity, as well as hand and eye
      coordination.<br>
      <br>
      Each SPACE CLUSTER S kit includes 24 connectors, 72 rods and
      illustrated instructions for building the cover models. Connect a
      few or all of the 72 flexible plastic rods with any or all of the
      24 triangular plastic intersections to create a variety of
      structures, ranging fro m simple spheres to complex polyhedra and
      sculptural constructions.<br>
      <br>
      Use your imagination to build your own designs and sculptures or
      follow the instructions to make the geometric models shown on the
      package. It is easy to change and rebuild creations as often as
      you like, or save your creation and hang it.<br>

      At each of these great gates of history, eighty to a hundred years
      apart, a similar generational drama unfolded. Four archetypes,
      aligned in the same order – elder Prophet, midlife Nomad, young
      adult Hero, child Artist – together produced the most enduring
      legends in our history. Each time the Grey Champion appeared
      marked the arrival of a moment of “darkness, and adversity, and
      peril,” the climax of the Fourth Turning of the saeculum. – The

      “The risk of catastrophe will be very high. The nation could erupt
      into insurrection or civil violence, crack up geographically, or
      succumb to authoritarian rule. If there is a war, it is likely to
      be one of maximum risk and effort – in other words, a total war.
      Every Fourth Turning has registered an upward ratchet in the
      technology of destruction, and in mankind’s willingness to use

      My Fellow Slaves -- This is what you get for invading Levant for

      of Coal 50 years ago:<br>

      Yesterday, I was hanging out in the Mojave Desert with " Ptooee "
      [ phonetic ], a Pleiadian ET smoking buddy, &amp; she said to me :
      " Alternating Current Electricity is Demagnetizing Planet Earth,
      Causing Pole Shift -- Catastrophe Looms -- The End is Now --
      Thanks for the Fish ! " <br>
      <br>
      I replied : " Surely, Miss Ptoee, You are Joculating ! "<br>
      <br>
      She said : " You are Unforgiven. "<br>
      <br>
      " Well, Copulate Me Running ! Please Expla ... ", I said as I
      passed out, drugged again !<br>
      <br>
      I woke up in my car, my crotch was itching, and my
      sphinctero-gluteal musclature was numb. The irritation turned out
      to be a soothing $35,000 , but my driver's license &amp; credit
      cards were missing. I suspect, however, there's a Pleiadian out
      there with a biomask of my face and fingerprints and identity
      plastic.<br>
