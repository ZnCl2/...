              synthase is a shared drug target for aging and dementia</b></font><br>
          <br>
          <b>J. Goldberg, et al.</b><br>
        </div>
        <b><br>
        </b><b>Summary</b> -- Aging is a major driving force underlying
        dementia, such as that caused by Alzheimer's disease (AD). While
        the idea of targeting aging as a therapeutic strategy is not
        new, it remains unclear how closely aging and age-associated
        diseases are coupled at the molecular level. Here, we discover a
        novel molecular link between aging and dementia through the
        identification of the molecular target for the AD drug candidate
        J147. J147 was developed using a series of phenotypic screening
        assays mimicking disease toxicities associated with the aging
        brain. We have previously demonstrated the therapeutic efficacy
        of J147 in several mouse models of AD. Here, we identify the
        mitochondrial a-F1-ATP synthase (ATP5A) as a target for J147. By
        targeting ATP synthase, J147 causes an increase in intracellular
        calcium leading to sustained calcium/calmodulin-dependent
        protein kinase kinase ß (CAMKK2)-dependent activation of the
        AMPK/mTOR pathway, a canonical longevity mechanism. Accordingly,
        modulation of mitochondrial processes by J147 prevents
        age-associated drift of the hippocampal transcriptome and plasma
        metabolome in mice and extends lifespan in drosophila. Our
        results link aging and age-associated dementia through ATP
        synthase, a molecular drug target that can potentially be
        exploited for the suppression of both. These findings
        demonstrate that novel screens for new AD drug candidates
        identify compounds that act on established aging pathways,
        suggesting an unexpectedly close molecular relationship between
        the two.<br>

        Would you eat venison if there was a chance it could slowly eat
        away at your brain?...<br>
        <br>
        First observed among captive mule deer in Fort Collins in 1967,
        CWD has since infected wild herds in 24 states and Canada. It
        has also been found in South Korea and Norway. In that time,
        there's been no report of human illness due to CWD exposure, but
        a recent Canadian study has renewed concerns that the disease
        could make the jump...<br>
        <br>
        Michael Miller, senior wildlife veterinarian for Colorado Parks
        and Wildlife, has released data showing that mule deer
        submission to Chronic Wasting Disease more than tripled near the
        end of 2017....<br>
        <br>
        CWD passes from animal to animal through prions, misfolded
        proteins that cause other proteins to misfold around them.
        Different prion diseases tend to only harm certain species, but
        can evolve to overcome those limitations.<br>
        <br>
        For instance, Mad Cow emerged in the UK in the mid-1980s after
        cattle ate the bone meal of sheep infected with scrapie, a
        similar brain-wasting disease. The disease then made the jump to
        people through infected beef products, causing a new variant of
        Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease...<br>
        <br>
        A new study has heightened concerns. Canadian researchers found
        that macaque monkeys contracted CWD after eating infected deer.
        The results mark the first time the disease has been shown to
        spread to a primate through meat, rather than through a direct
        injection of CWD prions into the nervous system...<br>

        <br>
        The interpretation of x-ray spectra emerging from x-ray binaries
        and active galactic nuclei accreted plasmas relies on complex
        physical models for radiation generation and transport in
        photoionized plasmas. <br>
        <br>
        These models have not been sufficiently experimentally
        validated. We have developed a highly reproducible benchmark
        experiment to study spectrum formation from a photoionized
        silicon plasma in a regime comparable to astrophysical plasmas.
        Ionization predictions are higher than inferred from measured
        absorption spectra. Self-emission measured at adjustable column
        densities tests radiation transport effects, demonstrating that
        the resonant Auger destruction assumption used to interpret
        black hole accretion spectra is inaccurate.<br>

              contradicted by hands-on tests at Sandia’s Z machine</b></font><br>
        </div>
        <br>
        ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. — A long-standing but unproven assumption
        about the X-ray spectra of black holes in space has been
        contradicted by hands-on experiments performed at Sandia
        National Laboratories’ Z machine.<br>
        <br>
        Z, the most energetic laboratory X-ray source on Earth, can
        duplicate the X-rays surrounding black holes that otherwise can
        be watched only from a great distance and then theorized about.<br>
        <br>
        “Of course, emission directly from black holes cannot be
        observed,” said Sandia researcher and lead author Guillaume
        Loisel, lead author for a paper on the experimental results,
        published in August in Physical Review Letters. “We see emission
        from surrounding matter just before it is consumed by the black
        hole. This surrounding matter is forced into the shape of a
        disk, called an accretion disk.”<br>
        <br>
        The results suggest revisions are needed to models previously
        used to interpret emissions from matter just before it is
        consumed by black holes, and also the related rate of growth of
        mass within the black holes. A black hole is a region of outer
        space from which no material and no radiation (that is, X-rays,
        visible light, and so on) can escape because the gravitational
        field of the black hole is so intense.<br>
        <br>
        “Our research suggests it will be necessary to rework many
        scientific papers published over the last 20 years,” Loisel
        said. “Our results challenge models used to infer how fast black
        holes swallow matter from their companion star. We are
        optimistic that astrophysicists will implement whatever changes
        are found to be needed.”<br>
        <br>

        Sandia’s Z machine, where hands-on experiments contradicted a
        long-standing assumption about the X-ray spectra from the
        vicinity of black holes in space. Loisel is the lead author of a
        paper on the experimental results, published in Physical Review
        Letters. (Photo by Randy Montoya) Click on the thumbnail for a

        <br>
        Most researchers agree a great way to learn about black holes is
        to use satellite-based instruments to collect X-ray spectra,
        said Sandia co-author Jim Bailey. “The catch is that the plasmas
        that emit the X-rays are exotic, and models used to interpret
        their spectra have never been tested in the laboratory till
        now,” he said.<br>
        <br>
        NASA astrophysicist Tim Kallman, one of the co-authors, said,
        “The Sandia experiment is exciting because it’s the closest
        anyone has ever come to creating an environment that’s a
        re-creation of what’s going on near a black hole.”<br>
        <br>
        <b>Theory leaves reality behind</b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        The divergence between theory and reality began 20 years ago,
        when physicists declared that certain ionization stages of iron
        (or ions) were present in a black hole’s accretion disk — the
        matter surrounding a black hole — even when no spectral lines
        indicated their existence.<br>
        <br>
        The complicated theoretical explanation was that under a black
        hole’s immense gravity and intense radiation, highly energized
        iron electrons did not drop back to lower energy states by
        emitting photons — the common quantum explanation of why
        energized materials emit light. Instead, the electrons were
        liberated from their atoms and slunk off as lone wolves in
        relative darkness. The general process is known as Auger decay,
        after the French physicist who discovered it in the early 20th
        century. The absence of photons in the black-hole case is termed
        Auger destruction, or more formally, the Resonant Auger <br>
        <br>
        <b>Destruction assumption.</b><br>
        <br>
        However, Z researchers, by duplicating X-ray energies
        surrounding black holes and applying them to a dime-size film of
        silicon at the proper densities, showed that if no photons
        appear, then the generating element simply isn’t there. Silicon
        is an abundant element in the universe and experiences the Auger
        effect more frequently than iron. Therefore, if Resonant Auger
        Destruction happens in iron then it should happen in silicon
        too.<br>
        <br>
        “If Resonant Auger Destruction is a factor, it should have
        happened in our experiment because we had the same conditions,
        the same column density, the same temperature,” said Loisel.
        “Our results show that if the photons aren’t there, the ions
        must be not there either.”<br>
        <br>
        That deceptively simple finding, after five years of
        experiments, calls into question the many astrophysical papers
        based on the Resonant Auger Destruction assumption.<br>
        <br>
        The Z experiment mimicked the conditions found in accretion
        disks surrounding black holes, which have densities many orders
        of magnitude lower than Earth’s atmosphere.<br>
        <br>
        “Even though black holes are extremely compact objects, their
        accretion disks ­— the large plasmas in space that surround them
        — are relatively diffuse,” said Loisel. “On Z, we expanded
        silicon 50,000 times. It’s very low density, five orders of
        magnitude lower than solid silicon.”<br>
        <br>

        <b>The spectra’s tale</b><br>
        <br>
        The reason accurate theories of a black hole’s size and
        properties are difficult to come by is the lack of first-hand
        observations. Black holes were mentioned in Albert Einstein’s
        general relativity theory a century ago but at first were
        considered a purely mathematical concept. Later, astronomers
        observed the altered movements of stars on gravitational tethers
        as they circled their black hole, or most recently, gravity-wave
        signals, also predicted by Einstein, from the collisions of
        those black holes. But most of these remarkable entities are
        relatively small — about 1/10 the distance from the Earth to the
        Sun — and many thousands of light years away. Their relatively
        tiny sizes at immense distances make it impossible to image them
        with the best of NASA’s billion-dollar telescopes.<br>
        <br>
        What’s observable are the spectra released by elements in the
        black hole’s accretion disk, which then feeds material into the
        black hole. “There’s lots of information in spectra. They can
        have many shapes,” said NASA’s Kallman. “Incandescent light bulb
        spectra are boring, they have peaks in the yellow part of their
        spectra. The black holes are more interesting, with bumps and
        wiggles in different parts of the spectra. If you can interpret
        those bumps and wiggles, you know how much gas, how hot, how
        ionized and to what extent, and how many different elements are
        present in the accretion disk.”<br>
        <br>
        Said Loisel: “If we could go to the black hole and take a scoop
        of the accretion disk and analyze it in the lab, that would be
        the most useful way to know what the accretion disk is made of.
        But since we cannot do that, we try to provide tested data for
        astrophysical models.”<br>
        <br>
        While Loisel is ready to say R.I.P. to the Resonant Auger
        Destruction assumption, he still is aware the implications of
        higher black hole mass consumption, in this case of the absent
        iron, is only one of several possibilities.<br>
        <br>
        “Another implication could be that lines from the highly charged
        iron ions are present, but the lines have been misidentified so
        far. This is because black holes shift spectral lines
        tremendously due to the fact that photons have a hard time
        escaping the intense gravitation field,” he said.<br>
        <br>
        There are now models being constructed elsewhere for
        accretion-powered objects that don’t employ the Resonant Auger
        Destruction approximation. “These models are necessarily
        complicated, and therefore it is even more important to test
        their assumptions with laboratory experiments,” Loisel said.<br>

        </b><b>Abstract</b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        When a two-dimensional (2D) electron gas is placed in a
        perpendicular magnetic field, its in-plane transverse
        conductance becomes quantized; this is known as the quantum Hall
        effect1. It arises from the non-trivial topology of the
        electronic band structure of the system, where an integer
        topological invariant (the first Chern number) leads to
        quantized Hall conductance. It has been shown theoretically that
        the quantum Hall effect can be generalized to four spatial
        dimensions2,3,4, but so far this has not been realized
        experimentally because experimental systems are limited to three
        spatial dimensions. Here we use tunable 2D arrays of photonic
        waveguides to realize a dynamically generated four-dimensional
        (4D) quantum Hall system experimentally. The inter-waveguide
        separation in the array is constructed in such a way that the
        propagation of light through the device samples over momenta in
        two additional synthetic dimensions, thus realizing a 2D
        topological pump5,6,7,8. As a result, the band structure has 4D
        topological invariants (known as second Chern numbers) that
        support a quantized bulk Hall response with 4D symmetry7. In a
        finite-sized system, the 4D topological bulk response is carried
        by localized edge modes that cross the sample when the synthetic
        momenta are modulated. We observe this crossing directly through
        photon pumping of our system from edge to edge and corner to
        corner. These crossings are equivalent to charge pumping across
        a 4D system from one three-dimensional hypersurface to the
        spatially opposite one and from one 2D hyperedge to another. Our
        results provide a platform for the study of higher-dimensional
        topological physics.<br>

        <div align="center"><font size="+1"><b>&nbsp;A look into the
              fourth dimension</b></font><br>
        </div>
        <br>
        Ever since Albert Einstein developed the special theory of
        relativity in Zurich in 1905, by «fourth dimension» one usually
        means time. But how can one visualize a fourth spatial dimension
        - in addition to top-bottom, right-left and front-back? In the
        arts Salvador Dalí tried that: his crucifixion scene painted in
        1954 shows as cross consisting of the three-dimensional
        unfolding of a hypercube in four dimensions (similarly to the
        unfolding of a cube into squares). A completely different, but
        no less fascinating, look into the fourth spatial dimension was
        now obtained by two teams of scientists from Switzerland, USA,
        Germany, Italy and Israel. The ETH researcher Oded Zilberberg,
        professor at the Institute for Theoretical Physics, played a
        pivotal role in both publications, which were recently published
        in the scientific journal Nature. He provided the theoretical
        basis for the experiments in which a four-dimensional physical
        phenomenon could be observed in two dimensions.<br>
        <br>
        <b>The quantum Hall effect</b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        Both experiments dealt with the so-called quantum Hall effect.
        Commonly, that effect manifests in the boundary layer between
        two materials, in which electrons can only move in two
        dimensions. A magnetic field perpendicular to the material
        initially leads to the classical Hall effect: a current flowing
        through the material gives rise to a voltage in the
        perpendicular direction - the larger the magnetic field, the
        higher the voltage. The reason for this is that the magnetic
        field generates a force acting at right angles to the direction
        of motion (the Lorentz force) that deviates the electrons. At
        very low temperatures and very large magnetic fields, however,
        quantum mechanics starts playing a role, which means that the
        voltage no longer increases continuously, but rather jumps in
        discrete steps. Three Nobel Prizes in Physics have so far been
        awarded for experimental and theoretical work on the quantum
        Hall effect.<br>
        <br>
        <b>A question of topology</b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        The quantum Hall effect can also be understood as a topological
        phenomenon. Topology describes, for instance, how many "holes"
        an object has and into what other shapes it can be transformed
        without cutting it. Similar laws are responsible in the quantum
        Hall effect for the electrons' only being able to move along
        topologically well-defined paths. For particular strengths of
        the magnetic field, for example, the electric current can only
        flow along the edges of the material, but not inside it. Around
        twenty years ago, it was shown mathematically that analogous
        topological effects should also occur in four spatial
        dimensions. "At the time, however, that was more like science
        fiction", says Oded Zilberberg, "as actually observing something
        like that in an experiment seemed impossible - after all,
        physical space only has three dimensions."<br>
        <br>
        <b>Virtual dimensions by topological pumping</b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        But Zilberberg had a clever idea: using so-called topological
        pumps it should be possible to add a virtual dimension to both
        of the real dimensions of the quantum Hall effect. A topological
        pump works by modulating a specific control parameter of the
        physical system, which causes its quantum state to change in a
        characteristic way over time. The end result then looks as
        though the system had been moving in an additional spatial
        dimension. In this way one can, theoretically, turn a
        two-dimensional system into a four-dimensional one.<br>
        <br>
        <b>An optical image of the fourth dimension</b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        That this can also work in practice has now been shown in two
        independent experiments. A team of physicists led by Mikael
        Rechtsman at Penn State University and including Kevin Chen's
        group at the University of Pittsburgh in the USA has realized
        Oded Zilberberg's idea by burning a two-dimensional array of
        waveguides into a fifteen-centimetre-long glass block using
        laser beams. Those waveguides were not straight, however, but
        rather meandered through the glass in a snake-like fashion so
        that the distances between them varied along the glass block.
        Depending on those distances, light waves moving through the
        waveguides could jump more or less easily to a neighbouring
        waveguide.<br>
        <br>
        The varying couplings between the waveguides acted as
        topological pumps and thus doubled the number of dimensions of
        the experiment from two to four. The researchers could now
        literally "see" the expected four-dimensional quantum Hall
        effect by feeding light into the waveguides at one end of the
        glass block and recording what came out at the other end with a
        video camera. In this way, for instance, the characteristic edge
        states of the four-dimensional quantum Hall effect, in which
        light should emerge only from the waveguides at the edge of the
        lattice, became directly visible.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Four-dimensional quantized transport of cold atoms</b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        Using extremely cold atoms trapped in optical lattices made of
        crossed laser beams, Immanuel Bloch and his collaborators at the
        Max-Planck-Institute for Quantum Optics in Munich also realized
        topological pumps. In their experiment, the pumping was effected
        by periodically varying the properties of the split lattice
        wells in which the atoms were trapped. By measuring the
        resulting two-dimensional motion of atoms in the lattice they
        were able to confirm that the atoms, indeed, behaved according
        to the topology of the quantum Hall effect in four dimensions.
        In particular, they were able directly to observe the quantized
        transport phenomena predicted to occur in that case (which are
        the equivalent of the voltage perpendicular to the direction of
        the current in the ordinary two-dimensional quantum Hall
        effect).<br>
        <br>
        <b>Progress in fundamental research</b><br>
        <br>
        So what's the practical use of all this? "Right now, those
        experiments are still far from any useful application",
        Zilberberg admits. But for fundamental research they represent
        important progress. Physicists can now investigate not just on
        paper, but also experimentally the effects that phenomena
        occurring in four (or even more) dimensions can have in our
        usual three-dimensional world. Quasicrystals in metallic alloys
        are one example. In three spatial dimensions such quasicrystals
        have no periodic structure, but when one looks at them in higher
        virtual dimensions, they actually exhibit regular patterns. And,
        finally, there is string theory, according to which higher
        spatial dimensions are "compactified" in such a way that, at the
        end, our normal three-dimensional world emerges.<br>

          <i>A NEW disease is feared to become even more deadly than the
            Black Death that killed thousands in 2017 after it killed a
            nine-year-old child.</i><br>
          <br>
          <b>By Anthony Blair</b><br>
        </div>
        <br>
        Uganda’s Ministry of Health denies outbreak of hemorrhagic fever<br>
        <br>
        The girl dropped dead with the symptoms of an extremely
        contagious viral disease than can kill up to 40% of all
        infected.<br>
        <br>
        She had contracted the bizarre new disease with similarities to
        the Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever.<br>
        <br>
        This disease — usually spread by tick bites or contact with
        infected livestock — can cause muscle pains, headaches,
        vomiting, diarrhoea and bleeding.<br>
        <br>
        And panic is spreading after the sudden death of a girl in the
        Nakaseke District of Uganda.<br>
        <br>
        A rapid response health team was rushed from the local hospital
        with a body bag to collect her and prevent any possible
        outbreak.<br>
        <br>
        Health teams disinfected the girl's home after her death on
        Thursday night local time, but didn't give her grieving family
        any details about when they could have her body back.<br>
        <br>
        Speaking to local media, family member Harriet Nalunkuma said:
        "We are stranded on what to do because the health teams took
        away the body.<br>
        <br>
        "We are waiting for a communication regarding the burial
        arrangements."<br>
        <br>
        Local district Health Officer Dr Badru Ssesimba confirmed that
        blood samples from the girl's body had been handed over to the
        Uganda Virus Research Institute, but wouldn't give more details.<br>
        &nbsp; <br>
        The plague death toll has risen to 143 in Madagascar. World
        Health Organization figures show the black death outbreak has
        now infected 1,947 people in the country off the east coast of
        Africa.<br>
        <br>
        Authorities at the hospital — who didn't want to be named — said
        that the body would be buried by health teams due to the
        "sensitivity" about a <br>
        <br>
        But local officials in the East African country — which has been
        plagued by similar outbreaks recently — said this could be a
        completely new disease.<br>
        <br>
        Last week Uganda's Ministry of Health denied claims by local
        officials in Nakaseke that Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic fever had
        broken out.<br>
        <br>
        But Permanent Secretary for the Ministry of Health Dr Diana
        Atwine confirmed that fluid and blood samples from the dead
        child are being tested to find out exactly what she died from.<br>
        <br>
        This week MPs in Uganda's Parliament claimed there was a
        cover-up of a deadly plague outbreak in Uganda by the
        government.<br>
        <br>
        Recently there were fears that a tribal 'Cleaning of Corpses'
        ritual in Indonesia could lead to a fresh Black Death outbreak.<br>
        <br>
        And the World Health Organisation warned last week that an extra
        £3 million was needed by April to stop the return of Black
        Death.<br>

        </div>
        <br>
        Fountain of youth? Miracle of heavens? No, it is really just
        smart scientists from Stanford University trying to prevent our
        brain from aging.<br>
        <br>
        A team of biologists conducted experiments with blood
        transfusions to mice and found a protein that may cause
        premature aging in rodents, according to a study published on
        bioRxiv.org.<br>
        <br>
        The study found out that the protein responsible for this is
        known as VCAM1; it interacts with immune system cells in
        response to inflammation. <br>
        <br>
        In the course of the study, biologists observed that old blood
        can prematurely age the brains of young mice, and scientists
        discovered that VCAM1, located in the cells that form a barrier
        between brain and blood, may be the reason.<br>
        <br>
        With time as mice and humans age, levels of this protein
        circulating in the blood rise, according to Alzheimer researcher
        Tony Wyss-Coray at Stanford University.<br>
        <br>
        He and his colleagues discovered that tampering with VCAM1 may
        help avoid the premature aging of brains. <br>
        <br>
        They genetically engineered plasma of the old mice which did not
        contain the protein and injected it into the young mice. The
        results showed that this plasma didn’t have a strong effect when
        injected into young mice, nor did it affect mice treated with
        antibodies that blocked the activity of VCAM1. <br>
        <br>
        According to the publication, “those antibodies also seemed to
        help the brains of older mice that had aged naturally.”<br>
        <br>
        The results point to anti-aging treatments targeting certain
        aspects of the blood-brain barrier may hold promise in slowing
        down the process of the brain’s aging.<br>

        Are we to believe that GMOs are simply the result of market

        responsible for far more economic loss than gain once
        employment, social, health, genetic and environmental factors

        society, damage universal wellbeing and threaten life in such
        fundamental ways. <br>
        <br>
        The reason for their success can therefore only be attributed to
        a cause important enough to justify the horrendous price we are
        all paying. And that cause is a global effort at the highest
        level of international governance to use food as a weapon
        against people and reduce the population in ways that allow
        governments to blame prices, drought, crop failure, and market

        Dear Mr Rense:<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        &nbsp;You’re probably unfamiliar with black farming. Since
        growing food is difficult work, requiring great patience and
        intelligence, black farmers are like black tennis champions -
        they are nearly non-existent.<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        &nbsp;I should know...I’m white.&nbsp;&nbsp; I grew up on a
        grain farm in Saskatchewan and worked for five years as a USDA
        contract Organic Inspector.&nbsp; I now live with my wife and 3
        kids down in Texas where I’m working to defend modern,
        science-based, farming in America. I have some rather
        interesting information to bring to your attention…<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        &nbsp;Since farmers are overwhelmingly white throughout the
        West, and blacks prefer the easy life in Democrat-controlled
        (destroyed) cities, social-justice warriors are shifting the
        so-called ‘organic' side of America’s diet to FOREIGN sources
        and growers…where organic rules and regulations (if there even
        are any) are vastly different&nbsp;&nbsp; How much so?<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        &nbsp;A whopping 80% of America’s $47 billion worth of
        ‘Certified Organic’ food, sold and consumed here, is now being
        imported from non-white countries like Mexico, Turkey and
        China…and with disastrous results!&nbsp; Even the New York Times
        admits organic food-borne illnesses are DOUBLE what they are for
        the CONVENTIONAL (non-organic) food industry.&nbsp; Double!!<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        &nbsp;Let me repeat those stats… 80 PERCENT of America’s organic
        food is imported, and it is TWICE as dangerous as regular
        factory-farmed food.<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        Oh!&nbsp; One more thing…better sit down again.&nbsp; 40% of
        this ‘organic’ food, sold and consumed here in the US, tests
        positive for prohibited pesticides. I don’t know if you buy
        organic food.&nbsp; If you do, stop!&nbsp; <br>
        <br>
        It’s mostly fake and often dangerous. What else would you expect
        from the world’s largest affirmative action program?<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        &nbsp;Why not get the word out on this?<br>

              Totalitarian Doctrine</b></font><br>
          <br>
          <i>Totalitarianism is a political system of absolute power
            where the state has no limit to its authority and regulates
            every aspect of public and private life.</i><i><br>

          <b>By Bill Warner</b><br>

        <br>
        THE NATURE OF ISLAM<br>
        <br>
        The most common assumption about Islam is that it is a religion
        based on the Koran. However, the religious aspect is only a
        small part of Islam. It is not possible to know how to pray or
        do any other practice of the religion with what is found in the
        Koran.<br>
        <br>
        Allah is found in the Koran and Mohammed is found in two texts,
        his biography, the Sira, which is a detailed life history and
        his traditions, or Hadith, are events that occurred in
        Mohammed’s life. The hadith is usually a few paragraphs long. A
        collection of his traditions (hadiths) is called the Hadith. So
        the Sunna is found in the Sira, his biography, and Hadith, his
        words and deeds.<br>
        <br>
        Over 90 verses of the Koran say that Mohammed is the perfect
        life pattern for all Muslims. Mohammed is the perfect Muslim and
        all Muslims are to pattern their life after his. He is the
        perfect father, husband, judge, leader, warrior, businessman and
        politician. His life example, what he said or did, is called the
        Sunna of Mohammed.<br>
        <br>
        Therefore, the totality of Islam is found in three books—Koran,
        Sira and the Hadith. Most people would be surprised to learn
        that the amount of words devoted to Mohammed is more than 6
        times the size of the Koran, the words of Allah.<br>
        <br>
        Another common assumption is that to know Islam, you must learn
        about it from a Muslim. This is not so. Islam is Allah and
        Mohammed. If you read the Koran (and it has now been made
        understandable) and know Mohammed, you know Islam. It is
        critical to understand the importance of this. Whatever is in
        the Koran and in the Sunna, it is Islam. If something is not
        based on the Koran and the Sunna, no matter who says it, is not
        Islam. The only Muslim who is an absolute and total authority on
        Islam is Mohammed. Once you know Mohammed, you know the only
        Muslim who matters.<br>
        <br>
        This means that only those who know Mohammed and Allah can
        reason about Islam. A corollary is that you don’t have to be a
        Muslim to understand Islam. And further, since most Muslims know
        little about the Koran and the Sunna, their comments about Islam
        can be personal opinions.<br>
        <br>
        POLITICAL ISLAM<br>
        <br>
        So all of the doctrine is found in three books—Koran, Sira and
        Hadith, the Islamic Trilogy. If you read the Trilogy, something
        remarkable becomes obvious, you find that most of the doctrine
        is not about how to be a Muslim, but refers to the non-Muslim.
        The Arabic word for the non-Muslim is Kafir, sometimes
        translated as infidel or unbeliever.<br>
        <br>
        In Islamic doctrine there is nothing positive about the Kafir.
        Allah hates Kafirs and plots against them. Muslims claim that
        Christians and Jews are accepted under Islam and are called
        people of the book. But the doctrine goes further and states
        that the only “real” Christians are those who accept Mohammed as
        the final prophet, agree that the Gospels are in error, and
        reject the divine nature of Jesus. The real Jews are those who
        accept Mohammed as the final prophet and consider the Torah
        corrupt. If a Christian or Jew does not accept this, then they
        are Kafirs. Pagans, polytheists, agnostics, atheists, and all
        others are <br>
        <br>
        Kafirs as well. It is important to note that Islam claims to be
        the final judge of all religions. This is part of its
        totalitarian nature.<br>
        <br>
        It is very instructive to see what portion of each of the
        Trilogy texts is about the Kafir.<br>
        <br>
        More than half of Islamic doctrine concerns itself with the
        Kafir. The Kafir is outside of the religion of Islam, and yet is
        part of Islamic doctrine. This doctrinal relationship is
        political, not religious or cultural. <br>
        <br>
        Political Islam is defined as the Islamic doctrine of the Kafir;
        the largest part of Islam is political. Only Muslims are
        concerned by religious Islam, but all of humanity is affected by
        Political Islam.<br>
        <br>
        Islam is not a religion, but a complete civilization. Islam has
        a position or rule for every aspect of life. It is a religion,
        culture and political system, a complete way of life. If Islam
        were only a religion, it would be of no concern. As an example,
        Buddhism is a religion, how much media and political space is
        concerned about Buddhism? Buddhism makes no demands on a
        civilization. Islam makes demands on every facet of society.<br>
        <br>
        TOTALITARIANISM<br>
        <br>
        Totalitarianism is a political system of absolute power where
        the state has no limit to its authority and regulates most
        aspects of public and private life. There are no competing
        political parties since they would balance and limit authority.
        The critical element of totalitarianism is absolute power
        striving to rule in as many areas of life as possible.<br>
        <br>
        Totalitarianism in Islamic Doctrine<br>
        <br>
        Totalitarianism is found in the very name, Islam. Islam means
        submission, submission to the Koran and the Sunna of Mohammed.
        We see the basis for absolute power in Mohammed’s life. After he
        went to Medina, he became a jihadist and attacked his neighbors.
        When he arrived in Medina, it was half Jewish. In two years,
        there were no more Jews left in Medina. They were exiled,
        assassinated, enslaved and executed. Mohammed attacked the
        pagans of Arabia and the Jews. After Arabia submitted to Islam,
        Mohammed turned to Syria and attacked the Christians.<br>
        <br>
        In the end, Political Islam will not tolerate opposition. Here
        is a sample of some of the Islamic political doctrine of
        absolute, total power:<br>
        <br>
        Koran 2:193 Fight them [Kafirs] until there is no more discord
        and the religion of Allah reigns absolute, …<br>
        <br>
        Here are two hadiths:<br>
        <br>
        Muslim 001, 0031 Mohammed: “I have been ordered to wage war
        against mankind until they accept that there is no god but Allah
        and that they believe I am His prophet and accept all
        revelations spoken through me. …<br>
        <br>
        Bukhari 4, 52, 196 Mohammed: “I have been directed to fight the
        Kafirs until every one of them admits, ‘There is only one god
        and that is Allah.’<br>
        <br>
        This doctrine, based on Mohammed’s life, is that jihad will be
        waged against the Kafirs until they submit to Islam. This theory
        causes relentless pressure in all areas of life over centuries.
        The doctrine is not in full force at all times, it waxes and
        wanes, but the pressure to bring the Sharia into power never
        vanishes. Today the power of Islam is increasing over the globe
        due to jihad and migration.<br>
        <br>
        After it enters a society, Islam rules given enough time. The
        result of Islamic political doctrine is that all power –
        political, cultural, and religious–becomes totally Islamic. The
        only exceptions occur when Islam is <br>
        <br>
        resisted by force, such as in Spain, the Balkans and at the
        Gates of Vienna.<br>
        <br>
        Universality of Islamic Doctrine<br>
        1. Islam applies to the most basic details of life<br>
        2. Every person and all nations must submit to Islamic doctrine.<br>
        <br>
        SHARIA<br>
        <br>
        Since Islam is a complete civilization, it has its own legal
        system called the Sharia. But Sharia is far more than a legal
        system of laws. It includes theology, law, philosophy, religious
        rituals and morals. The Sharia claims to be Allah’s law and must
        replace all other forms of government.<br>
        <br>
        One of the easiest ways to see the universality of Islamic
        doctrine is to examine a manual of Sharia law such as The
        Reliance of the Traveller [sic]. The topics include (but are not
        limited to) theology, how to pray, funerals, taxes, business
        law, banking law, wills, marriage, how to be a wife/husband, how
        to be a mother/father, sex, divorce, criminal law, apostasy,
        political rule over the Kafir, jihad, the dhimmi, Christians,
        Jews, punishment, family law, food, ethics, sex, art, dress, use
        of the bathroom, how to say hello, knock on a door, a structure
        of government, and on and on. There are few details of life that
        are not included in Islamic doctrine.<br>
        <br>
        Note that laws pertaining to the Kafirs are included in the
        Sharia. There is no one who is not included in Islamic doctrine.
        No one can opt out of the totalitarian Sharia.<br>
        <br>
        A TOTALITARIAN HISTORY<br>
        <br>
        After Mohammed died, Abu Bakr, his closest companion, became
        caliph. His first order was to attack and crush the Muslims who
        wanted to leave Islam. Everyone must submit to Islam and once a
        Muslim, you must remain a Muslim, or you can be punished.<br>
        <br>
        The next companion of Mohammed who became caliph was Umar. His
        ten year rule was spent in jihad conquest of the Christian and
        Zoroastrian Kafirs.<br>
        <br>
        The Law of Islamic Saturation<br>
        <br>
        Turkey used to be called Anatolia or Asia Minor and was a
        Christian civilization. Today Turkey is over 95% Muslim. North
        Africa, Egypt, Iraq, Syria and Lebanon used to be Christian.
        Afghanistan was Buddhist; Pakistan and Malaysia used to be
        Hindu. Today they are more than 95% Muslim. Islam does not reach
        a balance point with the native civilization; it dominates and
        annihilates the indigenous culture over time.<br>
        <br>
        This process of total civilizational domination is the Law of
        Islamic Saturation. The doctrine calls for jihad to never cease
        until the native population submits to the Sharia. As time goes
        on, the Sharia brings about submission to Islam. The doctrine is
        totalitarian, so the result is totalitarian.<br>
        <br>
        Islam is the most successful totalitarian system in history.
        There are post-Communist societies and post-Nazi societies but,
        there are no post Islamic societies.<br>

        4 Stages of Islamic Conquest<br>
        <br>
        Muslims begin moving to non-Muslim countries in increasing
        numbers and the beginning of cultural conflicts are visible,
        though often subtle.<br>
        <br>
        Via: Kali Politus&nbsp; <br>
        <br>
        First migration wave to non-Muslim “host” country.<br>
        Appeal for humanitarian tolerance from the host society.<br>
        Attempts to portray Islam as a peaceful &amp; Muslims as victims
        of misunderstanding and racism (even though Islam is not a
        ‘race’).<br>
        High Muslim birth rate in host country increase Muslim
        population.<br>
        Mosques used to spread Islam and dislike of host country &amp;
        culture.<br>
        Calls to criminalize “Islamophobia” as a hate crime.<br>
        Threatened legal action for perceived discrimination.<br>
        Offers of “interfaith dialogue” to indoctrinate non-Muslims.<br>
        <br>
        How many nations are suffering from Islamic infiltration? One? A
        handful? Nearly every nation? The Islamic ‘leadership” of the
        Muslim Brotherhood and others wish to dissolve each nation’s
        sovereignty and replace it with the global imposition of Islamic
        sharia law. Sharia law, based on the koran, sira and hadith,
        condemns liberty and forbids equality and is inconsistent with
        the laws of all Western nations. As the author and historian
        Serge Trifkovic states:<br>
        <br>
        “The refusal of the Western elite class to protect their nations
        from jihadist infiltration is the biggest betrayal in history.”<br>
        <br>
        STAGE 2:&nbsp;&nbsp; CONSOLIDATION OF POWER<br>
        <br>
        Muslim immigrants and host country converts continue demands for
        accommodation in employment, education, social services,
        financing and courts.<br>
        <br>
        Proselytizing increases; Establishment and Recruitment of Jihadi
        cells.<br>
        Efforts to convert alienated segments of the population to
        Islam.<br>
        Revisionist efforts to Islamize history.<br>
        Efforts to destroy historic evidence that reveal true Islamism.<br>
        Increased anti-western propaganda and psychological warfare.<br>
        Efforts to recruit allies who share similar goals (communists,
        anarchists).<br>
        Attempts to indoctrinate children to Islamist viewpoint.<br>
        Increased efforts to intimidate, silence and eliminate
        non-Muslims.<br>
        Efforts to introduce blasphemy and hate laws in order to silence
        critics.<br>
        Continued focus on enlarging Muslim population by increasing
        Muslim births and immigration.<br>
        Use of charities to recruit supporters and fund jihad.<br>
        Covert efforts to bring about the destruction of host society
        from within.<br>
        Development of Muslim political base in non-Muslim host society.<br>
        Islamic Financial networks fund political growth, acquisition of
        land.<br>
        Highly visible assassination of critics aimed to intimidate
        opposition.<br>
        Tolerance of non-Muslims diminishes.<br>
        Greater demands to adopt strict Islamic conduct.<br>
        Clandestine amassing of weapons and explosives in hidden
        locations.<br>
        Overt disregard/rejection of non-Muslim society’s legal system,
        culture.<br>
        Efforts to undermine and destroy power base of non-Muslim
        religions including and especially Jews and Christians.<br>
        <br>
        Is there a pattern here? Theo van Gogh is murdered in the
        Netherlands for ‘insulting’ Islam; the Organization of the
        Islamic Conference demands ‘anti-blasphemy’ laws through the
        United Nations; France is set afire regularly by ‘youths’ (read
        Muslims); the rise of (dis-) honor killings…holocaust
        denial…anti-Semitism…deception re the tenets of Islam; hatred
        toward Christians and Jews and Hindus and Buddhists.&nbsp; <br>
        <br>
        The pattern for all to see is the rise of Islamic intolerance
        and the covert/cultural jihad to remake host societies into
        sharia-compliant worlds – to remove host sovereignty and replace
        it with Islamic sharia law.&nbsp; <br>
        <br>
        Sharia law that condemns earthly liberty and individual freedom,
        that forbids equality among faiths and between the sexes, that
        rejects the concept of nations outside the global house of
        Islam, that of dar al-Islam.<br>
        <br>
        STAGE 3: OPEN WAR w/ LEADERSHIP &amp; CULTURE<br>
        <br>
        Open violence to impose Sharia law and associated cultural
        restrictions; rejection of host government, subjugation of other
        religions and customs.<br>
        <br>
        Intentional efforts to undermine the host government &amp;
        culture.<br>
        Acts of barbarity to intimidate citizens and foster fear and
        submission.<br>
        Open and covert efforts to cause economic collapse of the
        society.<br>
        All opposition is challenged and either eradicated or silenced.<br>
        Mass execution of non-Muslims.<br>
        Widespread ethnic cleansing by Islamic militias.<br>
        Rejection and defiance of host society secular laws or culture.<br>
        Murder of “moderate” Muslim intellectuals who don’t support
        Islamization.<br>
        Destruction of churches, synagogues and other non-Muslim
        institutions.<br>
        Women are restricted further in accordance with Sharia law.<br>
        Large-scale destruction of population, assassinations, bombings.<br>
        Toppling of government and usurpation of political power.<br>
        Imposition of Sharia law<br>
        <br>
        The website www.thereligionofpeace.com keeps track of the number
        of violent jihad attacks as best it can. The site lists more
        than 14,000 attacks since September 2001. It is worth a visit.
        What is occurring, <br>
        <br>
        however, that is likely inestimable are events where muslims are
        bullied by other muslims for not being “muslim enough,” where
        non-Muslims are intimidated into doing or not doing what they
        desire, where <br>
        <br>
        remnant populations are in a death spiral simply for being
        non-muslim in a predominantly muslim area. Christians, Jews,
        Hindus, Buddhists Animists and Atheists meet with death,
        property destruction or confiscation, forced conversion, rape,
        excessive taxation (the jizya), enslavement, riotous mobs and
        various other forms of islam (in-) justice at the hands of
        muslims in Sudan, Philippines, Kenya, Malaysia, India,
        etc.&nbsp; And let us not forget ‘death to Apostates’ the world
        over.<br>
        <br>
        STAGE 4: Totalitarian ISLAMIC “THEOCRACY”<br>
        <br>
        Islam becomes the only religious-political-judicial-cultural
        ideology.<br>
        Sharia becomes the “law of the land.<br>
        All non-Islamic human rights cancelled.<br>
        Enslavement and genocide of non-Muslim population.<br>
        Freedom of speech and the press eradicated.<br>
        All religions other than Islam are forbidden and destroyed.<br>
        Destruction of all evidence of non-Muslim culture, populations
        and symbols in country (Buddhas, houses of worship, art, etc).<br>
        <br>
        The House of Islam (“peace”), dar al-Islam, includes those
        nations that have submitted to Islamic rule, to the soul
        crushing, liberty-condemning, discriminatory law of Sharia. The
        rest of the world in in the House of War, dar al-harb, because
        it does not submit to Sharia, and exists in a state of rebellion
        or war with the will of ‘Allah.’ No non-Muslim state or its
        citizens are “innocent,” and remain viable targets of war for
        not believing in ‘Allah.’ The Christian, Jewish, Coptic, Hindu
        and Zoroastrian peoples of world have suffered under subjugation
        for centuries. The Dhimmi-esque are forbidden to construct
        houses of worship or repair existing ones, economically crippled
        by the heavy jizya (tax), socially humiliated, legally
        discriminated against, criminally targeted and generally kept in
        a permanent state of weakness, fear and <br>
        vulnerability by Islamic governments.<br>
        <br>
        It should be noted that forced conversions (Egypt) and slavery
        (Sudan) are still reported. Homosexuals have been hung in the
        public square in Iran. Young girls are married to old men.
        Apostates are threatened with death. “Honor” killings are
        routine. Women are legally second-class citizens, though Muslim
        males insist they are “treated better” than in the West. These
        more obvious manifestations may distract from some less obvious
        ones such as the lack of intellectual inquiry in science, narrow
        scope of writing, all but non-existent art and music, sexual use
        and abuse of youth and women, and the disregard for personal
        fulfillment, joy and wonder. Look into the eyes of a recently
        married 12 year old girl to see the consequence of the moral
        deprivation spawned by Islam.<br>

        In his own words, professional engineer Dr. John Milewski is
        "part wizard, part mad scientist". An internationally-recognized
        leader and consultant in the field of advanced materials, Dr.
        Milewski is a scientist, inventor, entrepreneur, writer,
        publisher, editor, and lecturer. He is primarily known for his
        work with magnetite and his protocols for magnetizing water.
        Over the last few decades, SuperLight (or magneto-electric
        radiation) has become a core concern of his research. Dr.
        Milewski describes SuperLight (known to mystics and
        metaphysicians as the nous, chi, and orgone or zero point
        energy) as the opposite of electromagnetic energy, revealing the
        previously unacknowledged parity of light. Instead of traveling
        away from a source at light speed, SuperLight is emitted from
        black holes and travels towards the source 10 billion times
        faster than the speed of light. In this segment, we will explore
        the discovery and implications of SuperLight, electricity vs.
        magnetricity, increases in solar activity, and why it is smart
        for us to focus our efforts on getting energy independent by
        investing in magnetricity and magnetic infrastructure.<br>

        The political economist Benjamin Friedman once compared modern
        Western society to a stable bicycle whose wheels are kept
        spinning by economic growth. Should that forward-propelling
        motion slow or cease, the pillars that define our society –
        democracy, individual liberties, social tolerance and more –
        would begin to teeter. Our world would become an increasingly
        ugly place, one defined by a scramble over limited resources and
        a rejection of anyone outside of our immediate group. Should we
        find no way to get the wheels back in motion, we’d eventually
        face total societal collapse.<br>
        <br>
        Such collapses have occurred many times in human history, and no
        civilisation, no matter how seemingly great, is immune to the
        vulnerabilities that may lead a society to its end. Regardless
        of how well things are going in the present moment, the
        situation can always change. Putting aside species-ending events
        like an asteroid strike, nuclear winter or deadly pandemic,
        history tells us that it’s usually a plethora of factors that
        contribute to collapse. What are they, and which, if any, have
        already begun to surface? It should come as no surprise that
        humanity is currently on an unsustainable and uncertain path –
        but just how close are we to reaching the point of no return?<br>
        <br>
        While it’s impossible to predict the future with certainty,
        mathematics, science and history can provide hints about the
        prospects of Western societies for long-term continuation.<br>
        <br>
        Safa Motesharrei, a systems scientist at the University of
        Maryland, uses computer models to gain a deeper understanding of
        the mechanisms that can lead to local or global sustainability
        or collapse. According to findings that Motesharrei and his
        colleagues published in 2014, there are two factors that matter:
        ecological strain and economic stratification. The ecological
        category is the more widely understood and recognised path to
        potential doom, especially in terms of depletion of natural
        resources such as groundwater, soil, fisheries and forests – all
        of which could be worsened by climate change.<br>
        <br>
        That economic stratification may lead to collapse on its own, on
        the other hand, came as more of a surprise to Motesharrei and
        his colleagues. Under this scenario, elites push society toward
        instability and eventual collapse by hoarding huge quantities of
        wealth and resources, and leaving little or none for commoners
        who vastly outnumber them yet support them with labour.
        Eventually, the working population crashes because the portion
        of wealth allocated to them is not enough, followed by collapse
        of the elites due to the absence of labour. The inequalities we
        see today both within and between countries already point to
        such disparities. For example, the top 10% of global income
        earners are responsible for almost as much total greenhouse gas
        emissions as the bottom 90% combined. Similarly, about half the
        world’s population lives on less than $3 per day...&nbsp; <br>

        Due to a lot of recent complaints from frustrated HHO buyers, I
        have updated this guide.<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        With the surge in gas prices, came a surge of people and
        "companies" selling hydrogen boost generators, systems and
        devices to increase your fuel economy. The amount of sellers
        gets bigger with every day. This alone puts up a warning flag.<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        Included is a brief on the Performance chips, Air Razors,
        Turbonators, Throttle body spacers, and other "bolt on
        performance and fuel economy"<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        This message is for all looking to purchase something of the
        matter.<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        Most all of these sellers here on eBay and elswhere on the net
        state that they have been researching for years and that it is
        now available to the public. Most all of them say their
        technology is patent pending and that their system is better
        than others. Most all of them claim huge "up to" increases in
        fuel savings.<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        I have been researching the Economy and Hydrogen world for
        sometime now. Being a auto mechanic and being not only booksmart
        but streetsmart, I have decided to try to evade people from
        throwing away their hard earned cash.<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        First the Hydrogen deal:<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        Lets get the facts straight. Water is H2O aka- 2parts Hydrogen,
        1part Oxygen combined together. When put under electrolysis or
        electrosis these molecules split forming a gas known as HHO
        which is a very explosive and powerful gas. The smallest of
        sparks can ignite the gas and if stored into container which for
        some reason caught fire the result could be fatal. No need to
        get scared though, if the proper precautions are made, no danger
        is to be seen.<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        HHO is about 3 times more powerful than gasoline vapor. Meaning
        1L of HHO would give your vehicle 300% more power than 1L of
        gasoline vapor. But feeding an engine pure hho would destroy it
        due to the fact timing is advanced(spark before TDC) on most
        vehicles but needs to be retarded(spark after TDC). Also the
        temperature at which HHO Burns is melting point of the metal it
        touches. SO...your valves and head would burn through in a
        matter of weeks. Also in diesel engines if you completely remove
        diesel from an engine the upper cylinder gets no lubrication and
        will wear out your piston rings FAST.<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        Getting enough HHO to power a car is pretty hard if not
        impossible. Explanation: a 2 cylinder 1L engine uses 1L of air
        per 4 revolutions (rpm). Gasoline is injected as a mist which
        turns into a vapor instantly at a ratio of 15 parts air to one
        part vapor. Which is .07 L. At 2000 RMP the engine uses 1/2L of
        vapor per SECOND. HHO is already one part oxygen to two parts
        hydrogen so too much air would thin it out too much and give no
        explosion. SO, even at a ratio of 10:1 that would require .85 L
        per second of HHO to power that same engine at 2000RPM. Kinda
        alot. NO generator I have seen or made can come close to the
        requirements.<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        So we use HHO to Boost the efficeincy of our gasoline engine,
        giving it pure hydrogen and oxygen to let the fuel burn better.
        This is where the good part starts.<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        Most sellers are selling systems that give less than 1/2 LPM of
        HHO. When mixed with the air going to the engine that makes
        NOTHING.&nbsp; 1/10-1/2 LPM of HHO will do some good for a small
        engine like 50CC-2.0L again more HHO to the bigger engine. Any
        engine over this size needs 1+ LPM. Alot of the sellers dont
        even know how much their system makes! They say "ALOT" but in
        reality all the cells I have tested that seemed to make alot,
        made 1/4-3/4 LPM. If the kit supplies gas via an aquarium air
        line, the system makes nothing, trust me.&nbsp; LOOK OUT FOR THE
        GAS OUTPUT. I recommend .5-1.0LPM per Liter of engine
        displacement. Example: 2.0L vehicle should have a 1-2LPM
        generator for good increase in economy.<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        Second, if a system uses alot of AMPS, it will fry your
        alternator and battery in no time which no one will tell you
        though. Look out for systems that draw over 15AMPs but put out
        less than 1LPM. This is not a wise investment. A full size truck
        can handle 25 AMPS but I dont recommend going over 20. Again,
        putting 20Amps on a 1.8L car, will make the alternator, which is
        usually 85AMPs, run at a high load and burn out. <br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        MORE EXPENSIVE DOESNT MEAN GOOD!<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        Upon testing, I find that without proper circulation of air
        around a unit (which is impossible under the hood of the car
        where it is already HOT) the unit boils over in a matter of
        minutes. So it starts drawing more amps, if you start at 10 you
        will get above 20 at boil. NOT GOOD. <br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        Any system made out of PVC(white) plumbing pipe that draws over
        15 amps is likely to boil. That pipe is not made to withstand
        that kind of temperature. It turns soft and flexible at that
        temp. It will warp, deform and likely leak in short time if
        there is any connections below the water line. Watch out for
        these types of systems.<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        The biggest concern is that most none of the sellers tell anyone
        that if you own a EFI (fuel injected) car which most people do,
        that you will need either an EFIE on your Oxygen sensor, or a
        resistor on your MAP or MAF sensor. These are fairly easy to
        build and install but it is a MUST and you will not see much
        difference in fuel savings without one, you even might see a
        loss of economy. It is used to trick the computer into thinking
        that the fuel mix is richer than it is. You want LEAN mix if you
        are running HHO boost. But too much oxygen in the exhaust will
        tell the computer to add more fuel which would cancel any HHO
        boost. Moving the Oxygen sensor out of the pipe but still
        mounted on the pipe will work on some vehicles (1996o or older).
        BE WARNED: too lean of a fuel mix WILL burn your valve seats and
        valve heads! Diesel cars do not suffer from this. I have found
        that vehicles newer than 1996, are close to impossible to trick.
        They have too many sensors and emissions systems which trip the
        CEL and put the vehicle into "safe" mode aka: full rich.<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        COLD WEATHER PROBLEMS:<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        As most of us in this country, we get below freezing
        temperatures in the winter. This causes another problem,
        Generator Freezing. If you have a sealed unit, once frozen, it
        will no longer be sealed. Also, a frozen generator does not
        produce gas until it is thawed, you also must be aware that if
        the water freezes in the lines, it obviously wont permit the gas
        from going anywhere. Water expands as is freezes and will break
        all water tight seals. The only way around this is adding
        anti-freeze or alchohol. Both of these have their drawbacks.
        Anti-freeze causes glycol buildup on the plates which hinders
        HHO production and is very hard to clean off. Alchohol severely
        lowers the HHO output while keeping the amps about the same but
        keeps the plates clean.<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        CONCLUSION!<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        I have tested many systems and put over $5000 into it all, I
        have built many different cells and tried many electronics. I
        have come to a conclusion that as of yet, there is no system out
        there worth "investing" into just yet. The reason for this is
        that the energy your car has to spend turning an alternator at
        full load is equal to running your a/c compressor full time and
        the fact that your battery suffers from this is even more
        costly. Add it all up and this "investment" isnt quite that. The
        cleaning of the cell and the measuring of electrolyte is also
        time consuming. Keeping it from freezing is also a hassle.<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        I have run a "Smacksbooster" cell in a Jeep Cherokee 4.0L. I was
        able to maintain a steady 25-30% increase in economy with a MAP
        enhancer. If you want to build a cell, build this one, it is
        fairly cheap and requires no special parts best of all if you
        use KOH (potassium hydroxide) and distilled water it typically
        requires no cleaning or maintenance except for adding water.
        UPDATE: I have tried the Smacksbooster setup on a 1998 Subaru
        Outback 2.5 DOHC. My trip was from Salt Lake City, UT to
        Portland, OR, 1600 miles roundtrip. I was unable to get an
        increase in mileage at all. In some cases, I saw a drop of my
        usual mileage. I have made this trip without the generator
        before and recorded all mileage readings. My conclusion is
        either it is impossible to trick the engine ECM or that the load
        put on the small engine is equal or more than the efficiency
        obtained.<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        I recommend not wasting your money or valuable time on this so
        called technology.<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        <b>&nbsp;The Performance economy chip SCAM:</b><br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        Alot of sellers selling these "performance chips" many have
        closed doors and opened new ones due to bad feedback.<br>
        Stay away from the "performance chips" as they are only a
        resistor, usually 33K OHM (5pack at Radioshack for $1) that goes
        on your air intake temperature sensor and give the car a little
        boost. Whether $40 or $.99 on eBay, they are the same and dont
        do anything for gas mileage as the sellers state. The shipping
        is outrageous too.<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        The AirRazor or Turbonator or anything of the sort will not do
        anything for fuel economy as they restrict the air flow to the
        engine. Especially at high RPM. They state it makes a Vortex and
        mixes the air and fuel better to let it burn but what really
        happens is it makes Turbulence which slows down airflow which is
        exactly opposite of what we want. Chrome the inside of your
        intake manifold and install a smooth intake if you want
        performance with economy.<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        Fuel magnets do not work on gasoline cars as I have tested
        several different vehicles. They do help diesel engines. Several
        people for whom I have installed my magnets, say increases of
        5-20% in economy. Stay away from Fuel Master (cheap ceramic
        magnets).<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        Fuel heaters do not do anything for fuel injected gasoline cars
        as the gasoline is already heated hot enough. They do work
        wonders on diesel as the fuel always returns to the tank and
        cools again never getting a chance to heat up hot enough for
        proper combustion.<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        Throttle body spacers dont do anything for a vehicle unless it
        is in full throttle position which is obviously not the point of
        saving gas. I have heard from two people that the AirRaid spacer
        increases economy 2.5-4 MPG on Chevy trucks.<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        Most economy devices only do good for the sellers and their fat
        wallets.<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        A good investment is a nice set of sparkplugs every 75K(Bosch 2
        or 4, Iridium, e3), a new set of ignition wires every 50-75K
        miles, a new fuel filter, a high flow air filter (K&amp;N,
        AirRaid, Fujita will last longer than your car) dont go for the
        China "cold air intake filter" Cheap foam will let ALOT of dust
        through.<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        Proper inflation of tires is a must. You can lose 10% for every
        5PSI your tires are under-inflated. Extra junk has to go. A
        100LBs will drop you 10% on a smaller car.<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        &nbsp;Use a fuel injector cleaner once in a while. I use 1/2oz.
        of ATF per gallon of gas at fillup. It cleans and lubes the
        entire fuel system and adds a couple mpg's. Change your oil on
        time with the proper viscosity oil. Install an oil filter magnet
        to go longer between oil changes. Fill up at a quality gas
        station ALWAYS. I tested fuel from various "cheap stations" and
        you dont want to know what I found.<br>

        Here is a list of wasted money courtesy of ME.<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        Water4Gas (no NEW technology here, just FREE info from the web,
        a pathetic electrolyser design and a waste of time) These are

        engine)<br>
        mybetterworld (the system seems to work for a few days at a time
        before cleaning needs to be done @ $1050, I dont think so. Try
        it if you wish)<br>
        HHO Express (the systems make little HHO output, their biggest

        I put up all the info a person needs to know to make an informed
        decision on where to put their hard earned money. Best off, use
        your common sense, if a system costs $1000, you wont pay it off
        in savings before you get rid of the car probably.<br>

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “You are more powerful than you know and they
        fear the day you discover it!” - Truth<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I remember listening to a talk by Sir Ken
        Robinson several years ago; about how backwards the education
        system is, and the imperative to implement major reform.
        Although he certainly gave an exceptional presentation on the
        matter, what ultimately captured my mind was the mention of what
        I now consider the most important study I have ever heard of in
        my life — a study in divergent thinking.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NASA — who houses the world’s foremost space
        program and some of the brightest people on the planet —
        contacted Dr George Land and Beth Jarman to develop a highly
        specialized test that would give them the means to effectively
        measure the creative potential of their rocket scientists and
        engineers. As a result, the duo came up with an unorthodox test,
        rooted in the process of divergent thinking; which is the
        ability to look at a particular problem and propose multiple
        solutions.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NASA were very pleased with the efficacy of
        the test results, and so it proved to be a huge success. But for
        Land and Jarman — who had obviously explored the concept of
        creativity in great detail whilst devising this test — they
        decided they wanted to explore and try understand the true
        source of creativity better. Was it a genetic trait? The result
        of life experience? Something else??<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because the test Land and Jarman created for
        NASA was so simple, it could actually be applied to any age
        group. So they found 1,600 children between the ages of 4 and 5,
        and decided to measure their progress. What they found shocked
        them.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Out of the 1,600 kids that took the test, 98%
        of them scored at genius level! Excited by these incredible
        findings, the team decided to turn this test into a longitudinal
        study, and give the same group of children the same test again
        in 5 years time. Once again their findings were quite shocking,
        but this time for conversely different reasons. Because these
        same children, by now in grade school, had rapidly declined to
        just 30%; a 68% reduction! The same study was conducted again 5
        years later on the same group of kids — by now in highschool —
        and they had dropped all the way down to just 12%!<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Disturbed, but still intrigued by this
        fascinating study, Land decided to conduct this same test on
        adults aged 25 and up (with an average age of 31). After
        numerous studies, what he invariably found, was that less than
        2% of all adults scored at genius level. And for those who
        question the consistency of these results — or think they may be
        isolated incidences — these results have actually been
        replicated more than a million times![1]<br>
        <br>
        We are being systematically dumbed down.<br>
        <br>
        The implications of this profound study are rather self evident,
        I would say. We are innately born with the potential of a
        creative genius, but the moment we enter the school system, we
        get dramatically dumbed down. The reasoning for this is not too
        difficult to apprehend; school, as we plainly call it, is an
        institution that has historically been put in place to
        ultimately serve the wants of the ruling class, not the common
        people. Whether it be ancient Sparta, Germanic Prussia, or the
        more modern industrial American system, education has always
        served as a “lawful” means of mass indoctrination.[2]<br>
        <br>
        If you would like to learn more about this history of deliberate
        manipulation, I highly recommend reading award winning teacher,
        John Taylor Gatto’s book The Underground History of American
        Education, which traces the genesis of modern day compulsory
        schooling and clearly demonstrates how it has always been used
        against us.<br>
        <br>
        You see, children pose the greatest threat of all to this
        corrupt system. Their “wild imaginations” are so intense and
        remarkable, that if left unchecked would result in a creative
        revolution that will ultimately compromise the ruling class’s
        proverbial game of monopoly. In order for the so called elite to
        maintain their lavish life style’s of overt luxury — where they
        contribute the least but enjoy the most — they understand that
        children must be dumbed down and brainwashed to accept (and even
        serve) their rapacious system of artificial scarcity, unending
        exploitation, and incessant war.<br>
        <br>
        <b>So Where Does Creativity Come From And Is It Too Late For Me
          To Get It Back?</b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        Creativity is born in the mind; specifically the imagination.
        The good news is, in spite of the ruling class’s best efforts to
        degrade our inner genius, the imagination can only be
        suppressed, it cannot be killed. Because every night when we go
        to sleep, the imagination gets stimulated.[3] Therefore, your
        creative potential — your inner genius — is simply sleeping
        within and just needs to be reawakened and rehabilitated.<br>
        <br>
        <b>How Can I Rehabilitate My Creativity?</b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        According to George Land, based on all the studies he has
        conducted and all the brain scans he has looked at, we must
        learn how to judge less, and look to understand more. We must
        criticize less, and be curious more. He also cites fear and
        anxiety as being extremely counter productive.<br>
        <br>
        Some of the greatest ways to deal with these mental
        debilitations, is to engage in practices like yoga, meditation,
        and physical exercise, since they help to alleviate stress and
        anxiety. They also inspire a process called neurogenesis — which
        is the creation of new brain cells. Diet also plays an important
        role in mental strength and overall wellbeing. In fact, I
        recently wrote an article about how roughly 10% of serotonin
        (which helps to regulate mood) is produced in the brain, and the
        other 90% in the stomach.<br>
        <br>
        The other thing, is to challenge your belief system. It is
        important to understand that whatever view we currently hold of
        the world, it is partly — if not wholly — the result of some
        form of cultural or societal indoctrination; and that regardless
        of how much we think we know, we are all ignorant in one way or
        another. We are still solving life’s problems, and we still have
        much discovering and exploring to do. Learning is a journey
        without end. So be humble and curious.<br>
        <br>
        We must also develop a keen sensitivity to our external
        environment. Avoid surrounding yourself with narrow minded
        people. Stop watching fear mongering news stations, or celebrity
        gossip. Stop watching television shows, and music videos, that
        reinforce stupid stereotypes and shallow lifestyles. Your
        imagination is the most important asset you can cultivate, so
        you cannot afford to allow it to be infiltrated and shaped by
        outward forces.<br>
        <br>
        Remember this, and remember it well my friends; this system is
        built on our imaginations. Money has imaginary value. Government
        has imaginary authority. And we have imaginary limits. If we
        want to change things, we must start with the imagination.<br>

              Bacteria? Try copper socks</b></font><br>

          <b>By Manuel Farias</b><br>

        <br>
        (Reuters) - Copper socks? Copper towels? How about copper subway
        poles? These are only a few of the ways Chile, the world's
        biggest copper producer, is utilizing the red metal which is
        more commonly found in the construction and auto sectors.<br>
        <br>
        Used since ancient times to make tools, weapons and plumbing
        systems, Chilean innovators are experimenting with ways to
        exploit copper's bacteria- and fungus-fighting characteristics.<br>
        <br>
        "Public transport systems, where germs can be transmitted and
        there are large numbers of people, are a potential market for
        applications for surface-metal copper," said Jurgen Leibbrandt,
        head of market development for the Chilean state copper giant
        Codelco.<br>
        <br>
        "In clothes there is another venue ... where it has excellent
        anti-fungus qualities," he said.<br>
        <br>
        Scientists say the power of copper to fight germs lies in the
        fact that copper ions separate on contact with bacteria and
        cause irreversible damage to the bacteria's cells.<br>
        <br>
        Codelco is already working with the private sector to market
        socks, towels, pillow cases and underwear sewn with copper
        fibresthat fight fungi and even help combat acne.<br>
        <br>
        And the private sector is in a drive to join Chile's leading
        export, copper, with another major exporter, the salmon
        industry, to cut disease in fish stocks.<br>
        <br>
        Chile is the world's second largest salmon producer after
        Norway, but the industry has high costs because of expensive
        solutions to controlling infections.<br>
        <br>
        "Joining these two industries to finding a solution that is
        economically viable is certainly viable," said Leibbrandt.<br>
        <br>
        One Chilean entrepreneur, Joaquin Ruiz, has invented copper
        sponge filters to purify water on salmon farms, eliminating
        disease and fungi and reducing the large amounts of costly
        antibiotics currently employed to do the same job.<br>
        <br>
        "That means huge savings. Instead of using large quantities of
        antibiotics and germ killing agents, with this you are just
        putting up a simple sanitary barrier," Ruiz, the developer of
        the Metal Foam sponges, told Reuters.<br>
        <br>
        Codelco is experimenting with bacteria-repellent cages for the
        industry.<br>
        <br>
        Investigators are also looking into where they can use the metal
        to reduce levels of infection in hospitals. They have found the
        metal helps to kill Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus
        (MRSA), a bacterium responsible for difficult-to-treat
        infections in humans.<br>
        <br>
        "If you prevent one MRSA infection, you save $21,000, so your
        return on investment will be very very short, perhaps one
        patient," said Michael Schmidt, of the University of South
        Carolina medical school.<br>
        <br>
        "So this is going to be a fairly efficient and inexpensive
        solution to combat infections."<br>
        <br>
        Some hospitals in the United States are testing copper as a
        germ-resistant surface material in place of stainless steel. A
        British study several years ago showed that drug-resistant staph
        germs survived for three days on stainless steel surfaces but
        were not detectable on copper surfaces after 90 minutes.<br>

        </b><b><br>
        </b>Atomically thin graphene exhibits fascinating mechanical
        properties, although its hardness and transverse stiffness are
        inferior to those of diamond. So far, there has been no
        practical demonstration of the transformation of multilayer
        graphene into diamond-like ultrahard structures. Here we show
        that at room temperature and after nano-indentation, two-layer
        graphene on SiC(0001) exhibits a transverse stiffness and
        hardness comparable to diamond, is resistant to perforation with
        a diamond indenter and shows a reversible drop in electrical
        conductivity upon indentation. Density functional theory
        calculations suggest that, upon compression, the two-layer
        graphene film transforms into a diamond-like film, producing
        both elastic deformations and sp2 to sp3 chemical changes.
        Experiments and calculations show that this reversible phase
        change is not observed for a single buffer layer on SiC or
        graphene films thicker than three to five layers. Indeed,
        calculations show that whereas in two-layer graphene
        layer-stacking configuration controls the conformation of the
        diamond-like film, in a multilayer film it hinders the phase
        transformation.<br>

        <br>
        Researchers at MIT have developed a process that can produce
        ultrafine fibers — whose diameter is measured in nanometers, or
        billionths of a meter — that are exceptionally strong and tough.
        These fibers, which should be inexpensive and easy to produce,
        could be choice materials for many applications, such as
        protective armor and nanocomposites.<br>
        <br>
        The new process, called gel electrospinning, is described in a
        paper by MIT professor of chemical engineering Gregory Rutledge
        and postdoc Jay Park. The paper appears online and will be
        published in the February edition of the Journal of Materials
        Science.<br>
        <br>
        In materials science, Rutledge explains, “there are a lot of
        tradeoffs.” Typically researchers can enhance one characteristic
        of a material but will see a decline in a different
        characteristic. “Strength and toughness are a pair like that:
        Usually when you get high strength, you lose something in the
        toughness,” he says. “The material becomes more brittle and
        therefore doesn’t have the mechanism for absorbing energy, and
        it tends to break.” But in the fibers made by the new process,
        many of those tradeoffs are eliminated.<br>
        <br>
        “It’s a big deal when you get a material that has very high
        strength and high toughness,” Rutledge says. That’s the case
        with this process, which uses a variation of a traditional
        method called gel spinning but adds electrical forces. The
        results are ultrafine fibers of polyethylene that match or
        exceed the properties of some of the strongest fiber materials,
        such as Kevlar and Dyneema, which are used for applications
        including bullet-stopping body armor.<br>
        <br>
        “We started off with a mission to make fibers in a different
        size range, namely below 1 micron [millionth of a meter],
        because those have a variety of interesting features in their
        own right,” Rutledge says. “And we’ve looked at such ultrafine
        fibers, sometimes called nanofibers, for many years. But there
        was nothing in what would be called the high-performance fiber
        range.” High-performance fibers, which include aramids such as
        Kevlar, and gel spun polyethylenes like Dyneema and Spectra, are
        also used in ropes for extreme uses, and as reinforcing fibers
        in some high-performance composites.<br>
        <br>
        “There hasn’t been a whole lot new happening in that field in
        many years, because they have very top-performing fibers in that
        mechanical space,” Rutledge says. But this new material, he
        says, exceeds all the others. “What really sets those apart is
        what we call specific modulus and specific strength, which means
        that on a per-weight basis they outperform just about
        everything.” Modulus refers to how stiff a fiber is, or how much
        it resists being stretched.<br>
        <br>
        Compared to carbon fibers and ceramic fibers, which are widely
        used in composite materials, the new gel-electrospun
        polyethylene fibers have similar degrees of strength but are
        much tougher and have lower density. That means that, pound for
        pound, they outperform the standard materials by a wide margin,
        Rutledge says.<br>
        <br>
        In creating this ultrafine material, the team had aimed just to
        match the properties of existing microfibers, “so demonstrating
        that would have been a nice accomplishment for us,” Rutledge
        says. In fact, the material turned out to be better in
        significant ways. While the test materials had a modulus not
        quite as good as the best existing fibers, they were quite close
        — enough to be “competitive,” he says. Crucially, he adds, “the
        strengths are about a factor of two better than the commercial
        materials and comparable to the best available academic
        materials. And their toughness is about an order of magnitude
        better.”<br>
        <br>
        The researchers are still investigating what accounts for this
        impressive performance. “It seems to be something that we
        received as a gift, with the reduction in fiber size, that we
        were not expecting,” Rutledge says.<br>
        <br>
        He explains that “most plastics are tough, but they’re not as
        stiff and strong as what we’re getting.” And glass fibers are
        stiff but not very strong, while steel wire is strong but not
        very stiff. The new gel-electrospun fibers seem to combine the
        desirable qualities of strength, stiffness, and toughness in
        ways that have few equals.<br>
        <br>
        Using the gel electrospinning process “is essentially very
        similar to the conventional [gel spinning] process in terms of
        the materials we’re bringing in, but because we’re using
        electrical forces” and using a single-stage process rather than
        the multiple stages of the conventional process, “we are getting
        much more highly drawn fibers,” with diameters of a few hundred
        nanometers rather than the typical 15 micrometers, he says. The
        researchers’ process combines the use of a polymer gel as the
        starting material, as in gel spun fibers, but uses electrical
        forces rather than mechanical pulling to draw the fibers out;
        the charged fibers induce a “whipping” instability process that
        produces their ultrafine dimensions. And those narrow
        dimensions, it turns out, led to the unique properties of the
        fibers.<br>
        <br>
        These results might lead to protective materials that are as
        strong as existing ones but less bulky, making them more
        practical. And, Rutledge adds, “they may have applications we
        haven’t thought about yet, because we’ve just now learned that
        they have this level of toughness.”<br>

        <div align="center"><font size="+1"><b>Scientists Discover A Way
              To Rejuvenate Old Human Cells</b></font><br>
        </div>
        <br>
        A team led by Professor Lorna Harries, Professor of Molecular
        Genetics at the University of Exeter, has discovered a new way
        to rejuvenate inactive senescent cells. Within hours of
        treatment the older cells started to divide, and had longer
        telomeres – the ‘caps’ on the chromosomes which shorten as we
        age.<br>
        <br>
        The research, Small molecule modulation of splicing factor
        expression is associated with rescue from cellular senescence,
        is published in the journal BMC Cell Biology.<br>
        <br>
        This discovery builds on earlier findings from the Exeter group
        that showed that a class of genes called splicing factors are
        progressively switched off as we age. The University of Exeter
        research team, working with Professor Richard Faragher and Dr
        Elizabeth Ostler from the University of Brighton, found that
        splicing factors can be switched back on with chemicals, making
        senescent cells not only look physically younger, but start to
        behave more like young cells and start dividing.<br>
        <br>
        The researchers applied compounds called resveratrol analogues,
        chemicals based on a substance naturally found in red wine, dark
        chocolate, red grapes and blueberries, to cells in culture. The
        chemicals caused splicing factors, which are progressively
        switched off as we age to be switched back on. Within hours, the
        cells looked younger and started to rejuvenate, behaving like
        young cells and dividing.<br>
        <br>
        The discovery has the potential to lead to therapies which could
        help people age better, without experiencing some of the
        degenerative effects of getting old. Most people by the age of
        85 have experienced some kind of chronic illness, and as people
        get older they are more prone to stroke, heart disease and
        cancer.<br>
        <br>
        Professor Harries said: “This is a first step in trying to make
        people live normal lifespans, but with health for their entire
        life. Our data suggests that using chemicals to switch back on
        the major class of genes that are switched off as we age might
        provide a means to restore function to old cells.”<br>
        <br>
        Dr Eva Latorre, Research Associate at the University of Exeter,
        who carried out the experiments, was surprised by the extent and
        rapidity of the changes in the cells.<br>
        <br>
        “When I saw some of the cells in the culture dish rejuvenating I
        couldn’t believe it. These old cells were looking like young
        cells. It was like magic,” she said. “I repeated the experiments
        several times and in each case the cells rejuvenated. I am very
        excited by the implications and potential for this research.”<br>
        <br>
        As we age, our tissues accumulate senescent cells which are
        alive but do not grow or function as they should. These old
        cells lose the ability to correctly regulate the output of their
        genes. This is one reason why tissues and organs become
        susceptible to disease as we age. When activated, genes make a
        message that gives the instructions for the cell to behave in a
        certain way. Most genes can make more than one message, which
        determines how the cell acts.<br>
        <br>
        Splicing factors are crucial in ensuring that genes can perform
        their full range of functions. One gene can send out several
        messages to the body to perform a function – such as the
        decision whether or not to grow new blood vessels – and the
        splicing factors make the decision about which message to make.
        As people age, the splicing factors tend to work less
        efficiently or not at all, restricting the ability of cells to
        respond to challenges in their environment. Senescent cells,
        which can be found in most organs from older people, also have
        fewer splicing factors.<br>
        <br>
        Professor Harries added:<br>
        <br>
        “This demonstrates that when you treat old cells with molecules
        that restore the levels of the splicing factors, the cells
        regain some features of youth. They are able to grow, and their
        telomeres – the caps on the ends of the chromosomes that shorten
        as we age – are now longer, as they are in young cells. Far more
        research is needed now to establish the true potential for these
        sort of approaches to address the degenerative effects of
        ageing. ”<br>
        <br>
        Professor Richard Faragher of the University of Brighton, will
        today argue for more research into the degenerative effects of
        ageing in a debate into whether science should be used to extend
        people’s lifespans.<br>
        <br>
        “At a time when our capacity to translate new knowledge about
        the mechanisms of ageing into medicines and lifestyle advice is
        limited only by a chronic shortage of funds, older people are
        ill-served by self-indulgent science fiction. They need
        practical action to restore their health and they need it
        yesterday,” he said.<br>
        Professor Faragher added: “Our discovery of cell rejuvenation
        using these simple compounds shows the enormous potential of
        ageing research to improve the lives of older people”<br>

        </b><b>Abstract</b><b><br>
        </b><b>Background</b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        Altered expression of mRNA splicing factors occurs with ageing
        in vivo and is thought to be an ageing mechanism. The
        accumulation of senescent cells also occurs in vivo with
        advancing age and causes much degenerative age-related
        pathology. However, the relationship between these two processes
        is opaque. Accordingly we developed a novel panel of small
        molecules based on resveratrol, previously suggested to alter
        mRNA splicing, to determine whether altered splicing factor
        expression had potential to influence features of replicative
        senescence.<br>
        Results<br>
        <br>
        Treatment with resveralogues was associated with altered
        splicing factor expression and rescue of multiple features of
        senescence. This rescue was independent of cell cycle traverse
        and also independent of SIRT1, SASP modulation or senolysis.
        Under growth permissive conditions, cells demonstrating restored
        splicing factor expression also demonstrated increased telomere
        length, re-entered cell cycle and resumed proliferation. These
        phenomena were also influenced by ERK antagonists and agonists.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Conclusions</b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        This is the first demonstration that moderation of splicing
        factor levels is associated with reversal of cellular senescence
        in human primary fibroblasts. Small molecule modulators of such
        targets may therefore represent promising novel
        anti-degenerative therapies.<br>

              technique grows food six times faster than conventional

          <b>by Tibi Puiu</b><br>

        <br>
        Australian researchers have demonstrated a ‘speed breeding’
        technique for common crops. Their method yields far more food
        per unit area than conventional farming, relying on specially
        calibrated LEDs that emit light at specific frequencies onto
        crops to accelerate plant growth.<br>
        <br>
        Using this setup, researchers showed that they could grow six
        generations of wheat, chickpea, and barley, as well as four
        generations of canola plants, in a single year. Typically,
        farmers in the field only grow one generation of each crop. The
        yields are strikingly high even when compared to crops grown in
        a lamp glasshouse environment, which produced two to three
        generations.<br>
        <br>
        This means that for the same unit area, it’s possible to grow
        six times more food than in the open field and up to three times
        more food than typical glasshouses, the authors reported in the
        journal Nature Plants — and this could prove extremely
        important.<br>
        <br>
        By 2050, the number of people on Earth is expected to soar to
        ten billion. At the same time, there’s an increasing demand for
        protein-rich foods, i.e. meat, spurred by an improved standard
        of living in developing countries. The problem is that the
        amount of arable land at our disposal will only marginally
        increase, which can only mean yield needs to improve if we want
        to satisfy the food requirements of the world.<br>
        <br>
        Genetically modified crops that are more resistant to pests and
        yield more nutrients per unit area are one part of the solution.
        Artificially developed food like lab-grown burgers may also play
        a role. But the truth is we need all the help we can get, and
        speed breeding looks very enticing at the moment.<br>
        <br>
        Speed breeding was initially explored by NASA over a decade ago
        as a means to enhance food production during space missions
        where efficiency is critical and every square inch counts.
        Scientists at the University of Sydney, the University of
        Queensland, and the John Innes Centre, continued the project,
        picking up from where NASA left off.<br>
        <br>
        Their setup involves specially-tuned LEDs that emit light in the
        far-red spectrum and at a high intensity to accelerate
        photosynthesis in intensive regimes of up to 22 hours per day.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “In the glasshouse, we currently use
        high-pressure sodium vapor lamps and these are quite expensive
        in terms of the electricity demand,” said Lee Hickey, a
        researcher at the University of Queensland and study co-author.
        “In our paper, we demonstrate that wheat and barley populations
        can be grown at a density of about 900 plants per square meter,
        thus in combination with LED light systems, this presents an
        exciting opportunity to scale up the operation for industry
        use.”<br>
        <br>
        The yields are certainly impressive but what was really
        surprising, even for the researchers themselves, was the quality
        of the crops. Raising plants this fast typically comes with
        significant downsides, leading to frail looking plants. However,
        the Australian researchers grew crops that not only yield more
        but also look better and healthier than those grown in standard
        conditions.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “People said you may be able to cycle plants
        fast, but they will look tiny and insignificant, and only set a
        few seed. In fact, the new technology creates plants that look
        better and are healthier than those using standard conditions.
        One colleague could not believe it when he first saw the
        results,” explained in a statement Dr Brande Wulff of the John
        Innes Centre, Norwich, a lead author on the paper.<br>

        Right now, there is no genetically modified (GM) wheat grown
        commercially so speed breeding could provide a promising
        alternative. What’s more, the authors acknowledge that speed
        breeding can be combined with GM crops to obtain even more
        outstanding results. Already, wheat breeders have lined up to
        gain access to this technology — companies such as Dow
        AgroSciences which is using speed breeding to grow wheat with
        tolerance to pre-harvest sprouting (PHS), a major problem in
        Australia.<br>

        </b><b>Abstract</b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        The growing human population and a changing environment have
        raised significant concern for global food security, with the
        current improvement rate of several important crops inadequate
        to meet future demand1. This slow improvement rate is attributed
        partly to the long generation times of crop plants. Here, we
        present a method called ‘speed breeding’, which greatly shortens
        generation time and accelerates breeding and research
        programmes. Speed breeding can be used to achieve up to 6
        generations per year for spring wheat (Triticum aestivum), durum
        wheat (T. durum), barley (Hordeum vulgare), chickpea (Cicer
        arietinum) and pea (Pisum sativum), and 4 generations for canola
        (Brassica napus), instead of 2–3 under normal glasshouse
        conditions. We demonstrate that speed breeding in fully
        enclosed, controlled-environment growth chambers can accelerate
        plant development for research purposes, including phenotyping
        of adult plant traits, mutant studies and transformation. The
        use of supplemental lighting in a glasshouse environment allows
        rapid generation cycling through single seed descent (SSD) and
        potential for adaptation to larger-scale crop improvement
        programs. Cost saving through light-emitting diode (LED)
        supplemental lighting is also outlined. We envisage great
        potential for integrating speed breeding with other modern crop
        breeding technologies, including high-throughput genotyping,
        genome editing and genomic selection, accelerating the rate of
        crop improvement.<br>

        </b><br>
        Generating segregating populations and ‘pure lines’ is an
        essential component in many projects of plant breeding and
        biological studies. Time taken to obtain these materials is
        often a critical factor restricting the progress of such
        projects. We report a procedure here which, by combining embryo
        culture with managements of watering regimes, lighting intensity
        and duration, temperature and quantity of potting mixture,
        allows the production of up to eight generations of wheat and
        nine generations of barley per annum. By dramatically shortening
        the time frame required to obtain segregating populations and
        ‘pure lines’, the procedure could find wide applications in
        breeding and biological studies.<br>

        </b><b>Abstract</b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        Copper has two key properties that are being exploited in
        consumer and medical device products in the last decade. On the
        one hand, copper has potent biocidal properties. On the other
        hand, copper is involved in numerous physiological and metabolic
        processes critical for the appropriate functioning of almost all
        tissues in the human body. In the skin, copper is involved in
        the synthesis and stabilization of extracellular matrix skin
        proteins and angiogenesis. This manuscript reviews clinical
        studies that show that the use of textile consumer and medical
        device products, embedded with microscopic copper oxide
        particles, improve the well-being of the skin. These include
        studies showing a) cure of athlete’s foot infections and
        improvement in skin elasticity, especially important for
        individuals suffering from diabetes; b) reduction of facial fine
        line and wrinkles; and c) enhancement of wound healing; by
        copper oxide embedded socks, pillowcases and wound dressings,
        respectively. The manuscript also reviews and discusses the
        mechanisms by which the presence of copper in these products
        improves skin well-being.<br>

        ...First of all, Pete Peterson, a high-ranking insider, designed
        a system for extracting bismuth into long, thin wires, as coils
        made from this wire would indeed demonstrate anti-gravity.<br>
        <br>
        The engineers had experienced a problem with these wires not
        extending long enough, which Pete was able to solve for them. He
        first told me about this in 2009....<br>
        <br>
        <b>ANTI-GRAVITY EFFECTS RESULTED</b><br>
        <br>
        Under electrical stimulation, researchers such as Linda Moulton
        Howe were seeing what appeared to be anti-gravity effects from
        these alleged Roswell artifacts.<br>
        <br>
        When "Art's Parts" were analyzed in a laboratory for their exact
        chemical composition, they were found to have large amounts of
        bismuth... and magnesium....<br>

        Internet data mining expert Clif High has a brand new report
        called “Soaring Twenties.”&nbsp; Clif High says there is good
        news coming, but not just for 2018, many years after.&nbsp; Clif
        High explains, “There is a really interesting set of data that’s
        been building for some time, and we have had this big flush of
        long term data, which is why I decided to do this report that is
        going out five years.&nbsp; I named it the “Soaring Twenties,”
        even though we are not into the 2020’s. . . . Our 2020’s, to
        some extent, are replicating the kind of language in the
        newspapers and limited news reels they had at the time of the
        1920’s.&nbsp; Only instead of being “The Roaring Twenties,”
        we’re going to have a “Soaring Twenties.” Clif High also talks
        about a coming “bond debacle,” soaring gold and silver prices in
        2018 . . . the future of Bitcoin and other crypto currencies,
        “legal actions will be taken” against the bad actors in
        government and the “Deep State.”&nbsp; Clif High also predicts
        some “fantastic levels of business failures.”&nbsp; <br>

        </b><b>Abstract</b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        Fullerenes are a family of carbon allotropes, molecules composed
        entirely of carbon. Fullerenes have been developed in various
        forms and functions and are expected to be used for novel
        medical materials targeting on brain. Information on
        cytotoxicity of fullerenes on brain function, however, is few;
        thus we examined the effect of fullerenes on the brain
        astrocytes in this study. We used fullerene [60],
        hydroxylated-fullerene [60], carboxylated-fullerene [60],
        dimalonilated-fullerene [60], carboxylated-carbon nanotube and
        amino-carbon nanotube. At first, we examined cytotoxicity of
        fullerenes by V79 colony assay. Fullerenes inhibited the cell
        growth in a concentration-dependent manner, but 50 percent
        growth inhibition concentrations were different among fullerene
        derivatives, which we used. Cytotoxicity of carbon nanotubes was
        stronger than that of fullerenes. Secondly, we performed the
        microtiter tetrazolium assay of normal human astrocytes and
        measured the effects of fullerenes on cell activity. Fullerenes
        and carbon nanotubes decreased mitochondrial activity. In
        addition to this, it was observed that fullerenes and nanotubes
        adhered to cells. These results suggest that fullerenes and
        carbon nanotubes have cytotoxicity and the effects are different
        from each other due to their side chain and steric forms. We
        expected that fullerenes and carbon nanotubes gave physical
        stress to cells and caused cytotoxicity. In conclusion, it was
        suggested that safety evaluation is needed for fullerenes and
        carbon nanotubes individually.<br>

        Celebrated inventor and physicist Nikola Tesla swore by toe
        exercises – every night, he’d repeatedly ‘squish’ his toes, 100
        times for each foot, according to the author Marc J Seifer.
        While it’s not entirely clear exactly what that exercise
        involved, Tesla claimed it helped to stimulate his brain cells.<br>
        <br>
        The most prolific mathematician of the 20th Century, Paul Erdos,
        preferred a different kind of stimulant: amphetamine, which he
        used to fuel 20-hour number benders. When a friend bet him $500
        that he couldn’t stop for a month, he won but complained “You’ve
        set mathematics back a month”.<br>
        <br>
        Newton, meanwhile, bragged about the benefits of celibacy. When
        he died in 1727, he had transformed our understanding of the
        natural world forever and left behind 10 million words of notes;
        he was also, by all accounts, still a virgin (Tesla was also
        celibate, though he later claimed he fell in love with a
        pigeon)...<br>

        <b>Significance</b><br>
        <br>
        Humans and other animals effectively use acoustic waves to
        communicate with each other. Ultrasonic acoustic waves are
        intriguing because they do not interfere with normal voice
        communication and can be highly directional with long range.
        Therefore, wireless ultrasonic radio is a useful communications
        method. Here we find that graphene has mechanical properties
        that make it ideally suited for wide-band ultrasonic
        transduction. Using simple and low-cost fabrication methods we
        have produced an ultrasonic microphone and ultrasonic radio
        prototypes. When acting as loudspeaker/microphone alone, the
        graphene-based acoustic devices also show ideal flat-band
        frequency response spanning the whole audible region as well as
        ultrasonic region to at least 0.5 MHz; such flat frequency
        response has significant acoustic applications implications.<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        <b>Abstract</b><br>
        <br>
        We present a graphene-based wideband microphone and a related
        ultrasonic radio that can be used for wireless communication. It
        is shown that graphene-based acoustic transmitters and receivers
        have a wide bandwidth, from the audible region (20~20 kHz) to
        the ultrasonic region (20 kHz to at least 0.5 MHz). Using the
        graphene-based components, we demonstrate efficient
        high-fidelity information transmission using an ultrasonic band
        centered at 0.3 MHz. The graphene-based microphone is also shown
        to be capable of directly receiving ultrasound signals generated
        by bats in the field, and the ultrasonic radio, coupled to
        electromagnetic (EM) radio, is shown to function as a
        high-accuracy rangefinder. The ultrasonic radio could serve as a
        useful addition to wireless communication technology where the
        propagation of EM waves is difficult.<br>

          more power:<br>
        </b><b><br>
        </b><a href="https://fitchfuelcatalyst.com/" "><b>https://fitchfuelcatalyst.com/</b></a><b><br>
        </b><b>Advanced Power Systems International, Inc.</b><br>
        <br>
        Advanced Power Systems International, Inc. (APSI) is a 20 year
        old company which was formed to develop, manufacture and market
        the Fitch® Fuel Catalyst technology. The Fitch Fuel Catalyst is
        a true catalyst which reformulates gasoline, diesel, fuel oil
        and propane allowing the user to extract more energy from these
        fuels. By doing so the user can either increase performance, in
        terms of horsepower and torque, or increase fuel efficiency by
        using less fuel to do the same amount of work. It can also
        produce a combination of both depending on the application.<br>
        <br>
        Because the Fitch Fuel Catalyst causes more complete and
        efficient combustion there is less residue left after combustion
        something which you know of as “emissions”.&nbsp; Thus Green
        House gases and pollution are reduced significantly. <br>
        <br>
        The Fitch Fuel Catalyst reformulates gasoline, diesel, fuel oil,
        propane and natral gas causing the reformulated fuels to produce
        more energy during combustion than these fuels otherwise would.
        It is a true catalyst which by definition causes one or more
        chemical reactions but does not participate in them. Because it
        doesn't participate in the reaction, unlike additives, it is not
        consumed in the reaction and thus lasts for years after initial
        installation. The Fitch Fuel Catalyst also has no moving parts
        and is thus maintenance free.<br>
        <br>
        Because the Fitch Fuel Catalyst causes more complete combustion
        it also reduces pollution and toxic emissions in the form of
        greenhouse gases, polyaromatic hydrocarbons, particulates and
        soot. When combustion is complete and 100% of the potential
        energy is extracted from the fuel the byproducts of combustion
        are carbon dioxide (CO2), water (H2O) and nitrogen (N). Toxic
        emissions such as greenhouse gases are a byproduct of incomplete
        combustion. Because the Fitch Fuel Catalyst causes more complete
        combustion these toxic emissions are reduced
        substantially.&nbsp; Maintenance costs and unscheduled downtime
        are also significantly reduced because of reduced carbon build
        up.<br>
        <br>
        Using Dart Mass spectrometry Dr. Steven Suib and members of the
        Suib Research Group at the University of Connecticut were able
        to identify four positive molecular changes&nbsp; the Fitch Fuel
        Catalyst induced in treated fuels. This research was, in part,
        funded by a grant from the United States Department of
        Energy.&nbsp; <br>
        <br>
        The Fitch technology has been validated numerous times including
        by a University Laboratory, a number of independent engineering
        test facilities using ASTM test protocols, a number of
        independent performance testing facilities, a number of
        publications and by our customers. ..<br>

        ...While the metrics noted above can accurately indicate the
        peak of an equities bubbles several months in advance, they
        cannot tell us anything years ahead of time. For this, we must
        turn to the research of the original wizard of Wall Street, W.D.
        Gann. He was a finance trader who developed technical analysis
        tools and forecasting methods based on geometry, astronomy,
        astrology and ancient mathematics.<br>
        <br>
        He was a successful and wealthy speculator, spending decades
        investigating patterns in equities markets. He concluded that
        equities exhibited a cyclical trend over decades and thus prices
        could be predicted long in advance.<br>
        <br>
        In 1908, Gann constructed his financial timetable, which
        tabulated the booms and busts, peaks and troughs of the US
        equities market. Just like the Geoist land market cycle, there
        is a repeating 18-year average between every major cycle.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gann managed to predict the crash of 1929
        years in advance. He realised that the timetable would have to
        be recalibrated on the 25th December 1989.<br>
        <br>
        The updated timetable is amazingly accurate from that date
        onward, predicting the Dot-Com bubble peak in 2000 and its
        collapse. The GFC peak was off by one year; 2007 instead of one
        year earlier in 2006. The trough was in 2009, followed by a
        minor panic in 2015, when the S&amp;P500 dipped but has since
        boomed.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to the timetable, 2020 will be the
        peak of the equities bubble, followed by a major crash similar
        to that of the Dot-Com bubble.<br>
        <br>
        To the economists we’ve spoken to, the peak could range between
        2019M09 to 2020M03. Given how large the S&amp;P500 bubble has
        become, it is worth treading very carefully during this period
        for those exposed to US equities.<br>
        Gann is famous for saying: “Every movement in the market is the
        result of a natural law and of a Cause which exists long before
        the effect takes place and can be determined years in advance.
        The future is but a repetition of the past, as the Bible plainly
        states…”<br>
