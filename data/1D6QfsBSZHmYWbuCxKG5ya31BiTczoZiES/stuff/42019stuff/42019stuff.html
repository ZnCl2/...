          <div align="center"><b>UB researchers develop new variant of
              Maxwell’s demon at nanoscale</b><br>
          </div>
          <b><br>
          </b>Maxwell’s demon is a machine proposed by James Clerk
          Maxwell in 1897. The hypothetical machine would use thermal
          fluctuations to obtain energy, apparently violating the second
          principle of thermodynamics. Now, researchers of the
          University of Barcelona have presented the first theoretical
          and experimental solution of a continuous version of Maxwell’s
          demon in a single molecule system. The results, published in
          the journal Nature Physics, can have applications in other
          fields, such as biological and quantum systems.<br>
          <br>
          “Despite its simplicity and the large amount of work in the
          field this new variant of the classical Maxwell demon has
          remained unexplored until now”, notes Fèlix Ritort, professor
          from the Department of Fundamental Physics of the UB. “In this
          study -he adds-, we introduced a system able to extract large
          amounts of work arbitrarily per cycle through repeated
          measurements of the state of a system”.<br>
          <br>
          Continuous version of Maxwell’s demon is able to extract large
          amounts of work arbitrarily per cycle through repeated
          measurements of the state of a system.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Finding the favourable moment<br>
          </b><br>
          Waiting for such a propitious occasion to get benefits is
          something we all know. This behavioural pattern is the same of
          a speculator waiting for the right moment in stock exchange,
          or a predator waiting for a prey to be near. “From a
          thermodynamics point of view, that certain intuitive aspect in
          trying to look for the right moment is what takes more energy.
          The answer is whether it is possible to get the same energy
          from the propitious moment than the inverted one in the
          searching process, i.e. through a thermodynamically reversible
          process”, notes Marco Ribezzi, researcher at the UB and the
          School of Industrial Physics and Chemistry (ESPCI Paris/CNRS).<br>
          <br>
          “Our experiments demonstrate it is possible to find the right
          moment, and not very common at the same time, and to use it in
          a reversible way. These results show the underlying
          thermodynamic structure to a general problem that can find
          many applications, for instance, in the field of biology”,
          notes Ribezzi.<br>
          <br>
          According to the researchers, the new version of Maxwell’s
          demon could have consequences in self-organization and
          selection processes that occur during evolution of the
          biological matter. For instance, this device could be relevant
          in the regulation of biological networks in generation,
          transmission and transduction of signals through cell
          membranes.<br>
          <br>
          The experimental testing has been conducted in a system of
          optical tweezers, which enables the manipulation of a molecule
          each time, in this case a DNA molecule. With the right force
          on this structure, it is possible to unfold it, but if the
          force is small enough, the unfolded state becomes rare, so it
          finds the precise moment it was looking for. When the molecule
          is in a rare state, it has more energy and it is possible to
          use it. “The rarer the episode, the harder for us to find it,
          but the more energy we can get from it”, notes Ribezzi.<br>
          <br>
          “The astonishing complexity of the living matter could be seen
          as the result, over several evolutionary timescales, of a big
          process of energy extraction in proper environments to store
          big amounts of information which is hidden by noise and
          randomness”, concludes Ritort, also member of the
          Bioengineering, Biomaterials and Nanomedicine Networking
          Biomedical Research Centre (CIBER-BBN).<br>
          <br>
          Within the program Future and Emerging Technologies (FET),
          this study has been conducted as part of the European project
          Information, Fluctuations and Energy Control in Small Systems
          (INFERNOS), with the aim to experiment on the Maxwell’s
          mechanism at a nanoscale, i.e the creation of electronic and
          biomolecular nanodevices to follow the principle of Maxwell’s
          demon.<br>

              Turkey: “Metallic wood” is 5 times stronger than titanium,
              but lighter</b><br>
            <b>by: Lance D Johnson</b><br>
          </div>
          <b><br>
          </b>Turkish inventors have created a new building material
          that is five times stronger than titanium and has the density
          of wood planks. Most remarkably, this new “Metallic wood” is
          lighter than titanium and still has the chemical stability of
          metal for use in manufacturing applications.<br>
          <br>
          The new material is made out of nickel-based cellular
          materials as small as 17 nano-meters in diameter. These
          electroplated nickel nano-particles are strategically arranged
          in struts to maximize their load-bearing strength as a whole.
          This strategic arrangement of nickel makes the material four
          times stronger than bulk nickel plating. By tinkering with
          nano-meter-scale geometry, the inventors can increase the
          strength and density of the new material. This geometric
          arrangement of cellular materials is spatially organized and
          repeated to generate the new “Metallic wood” material. This
          geometric nano-meter engineering feat produces a very dense
          material, like that of wood. The inventors have even made the
          material as dense as water (1,000?kg/m3).<br>
          <br>
          Each 17 nano meter strut has a tensile strength as high as 8
          GPa, an unprecedented measurement for something this small in
          size. Through compression testing, the inventors found that
          these nano-pillars can be reduced in diameter to increase the
          load bearing strength of the entire material. The problem that
          often occurs in developing new materials is scaling the
          material to meet real life applications. The macroscopic
          properties are just as important as the strength of the
          nano-pillars contained therein. The strength of the entire
          material can vary at different masses and shapes. For example,
          in nano-pillars made from nano-crystalline metals, there is an
          increase in strength at a certain mass, but a decrease in
          strength when the overall mass is reduced to the size of a
          grain.<br>
          <br>
          In real-life application, this new “Metallic wood” does have
          enough mass to support various loads in industrial
          manufacturing and construction applications. The new material,
          although very light, has the density to stand up to real-life
          applications.<br>
          <br>
          This new material is the first of its kind to multiply a
          nano-structured cellular material to develop a workable
          material for manufacturing, with a specific strength that is
          above 100 Mpa/(Mg/m3). Most nano-scale pillar materials lack
          the density needed to be used in all manufacturing
          applications.<br>
          <br>
          The development of these nano-structures started with the
          fabrication of opal material, monodisperse polystyrene
          particles, and gold/chromium coated substrates. The
          polystyrene was stabilized at just the right temperature to
          increase the diameter between polystyrene spheres. This
          allowed the inventors to deposit nickel into the voids of the
          polystyrene structure. The interconnected spherical pores were
          oriented in a cubic formation. Additional nickel was added to
          increase the volume fraction of the nano-pillars, their
          diameter, and their mass...<br>

            Abstract<br>
          </b>This paper describes a nickel-based cellular material,
          which has the strength of titanium and the density of water.
          The material’s strength arises from size-dependent
          strengthening of load-bearing nickel struts whose diameter is
          as small as 17?nm and whose 8?GPa yield strength exceeds that
          of bulk nickel by up to 4X. The mechanical properties of this
          material can be controlled by varying the nanometer-scale
          geometry, with strength varying over the range 90–880?MPa,
          modulus varying over the range 14–116?GPa, and density varying
          over the range 880–14500?kg/m3. We refer to this material as a
          “metallic wood,” because it has the high mechanical strength
          and chemical stability of metal, as well as a density close to
          that of natural materials such as wood...<br>
          <br>
          Here we report a cellular material based on nanostructured
          nickel inverse opal materials. The mechanical properties of
          this material are governed by the size-dependent strengthening
          of nanometer-scale structural elements, allowing large
          specific strengths up to 230?MPa/(Mg/m3) in porous nickel.
          This specific strength is larger than most high strength
          metals including high strength stainless steel and
          Ti-6Al-4V31,32. The mechanical properties of this material can
          be varied between natural materials and high strength metal
          alloys by controlling the geometric parameters within the
          cellular architecture; we demonstrate materials with yield
          strengths over the range 90–880?MPa, specific moduli
          7–25?GPa/(Mg/m3), and densities 880–14500?kg/m3. Using finite
          element simulations and well established micropillar
          compression and nanoindentation testing, we find that the
          material strength increases as the nanometer-scale strut
          diameter decreases. The strut yield strengths increase from
          3.8 to 8.1?GPa as the strut diameter decreases from 115 to
          17?nm, which is a 4X increase over the 2?GPa bulk deposited
          nickel yield strength...<br>
          <b><br>
            Conclusion<br>
          </b>In conclusion, we present metallic wood fabricated from
          nickel inverse opals, which has the strength of titanium and
          the chemical properties of a metal, while having the density
          of water and the cellular nature of natural materials like
          wood. The high strength of the metallic wood results from the
          size-dependent strengthening of the inverse opal struts, which
          have up to 4X the yield strength of bulk electrodeposited
          nickel and enable high specific strengths of 230?MPa/(Mg/m3).
          The cellular structure can be controlled to tune the modulus
          and strength each by a factor of 10X.<br>
          <br>
          The metallic wood can be easily fabricated over 100 mm2 areas,
          can be processed at room temperature, and can be combined with
          additional functional materials, as demonstrated with the
          rhenium coatings49. The high strength continuous metallic
          architecture with isotropic elasticity, high hardness, and
          high strain energy storage could be important for a variety of
          applications such as energy storage50,51,52, heat transport53,
          and sensors54,55. Future work could explore improvements in
          specific strength above 230?MPa/(Mg/m3) by incorporating
          lightweight metals such as titanium or aluminum and developing
          roll-to-toll processing of high strength porous metals from
          self-assembly...<br>

          <b><br>
          </b>Physicists at the University of Zurich have developed an
          amazingly simple device that allows heat to flow temporarily
          from a cold to a warm object without an external power supply.
          Intriguingly, the process initially appears to contradict the
          fundamental laws of physics.<br>
          <br>
          If you put a teapot of boiling water on the kitchen table, it
          will gradually cool down. However, its temperature is not
          expected to fall below that of the table. It is precisely this
          everyday experience that illustrates one of the fundamental
          laws of physics – the second law of thermodynamics – which
          states that the entropy of a closed natural system must
          increase over time. Or, more simply put: Heat can flow by
          itself only from a warmer to a colder object, and not the
          other way round.<br>
          Cooling below room temperature<br>
          <br>
          The results of a recent experiment carried out by the research
          group of Prof. Andreas Schilling in the Department of Physics
          at the University of Zurich (UZH) appear at first sight to
          challenge the second law of thermodynamics. The researchers
          managed to cool a nine-gram piece of copper from over 100°C to
          significantly below room temperature without an external power
          supply. “Theoretically, this experimental device could turn
          boiling water to ice, without using any energy,” says
          Schilling.<br>
          <b><br>
            Creating oscillating heat currents<br>
          </b>To achieve this, the researchers used a Peltier element, a
          component commonly used, for example, to cool minibars in
          hotel rooms. These elements can transform electric currents
          into temperature differences. The researchers had already used
          this type of element in previous experiments, in connection
          with an electric inductor, to create an oscillating heat
          current in which the flow of heat between two bodies
          perpetually changed direction. In this scenario, heat also
          temporarily flows from a colder to a warmer object so that the
          colder object is cooled down further. This kind of “thermal
          oscillating circuit” in effect contains a “thermal inductor”.
          It functions in the same way as an electrical oscillating
          circuit, in which the voltage oscillates with a constantly
          changing sign.<br>
          Laws of physics remain intact<br>
          <br>
          Until now, Schilling’s team had only operated these thermal
          oscillating circuits using an energy source. The researchers
          have now shown for the first time that this kind of thermal
          oscillating circuit can also be operated “passively”, i.e.
          with no external power supply. Thermal oscillations still
          occurred and, after a while, heat flowed directly from the
          colder copper to a warmer heat bath with a temperature of
          22°C, without being temporarily transformed into another form
          of energy. Despite this, the authors were also able to show
          that the process does not actually contradict any laws of
          physics. To prove it, they considered the change in entropy of
          the whole system and showed that it increased with time –
          fully in accordance with the second law of thermodynamics.<br>
          <b><br>
            Potential application still a long way off</b><br>
          Although the team recorded a difference of only about 2°C
          compared to the ambient temperature in the experiment, this
          was mainly due to the performance limitations of the
          commercial Peltier element used. According to Schilling, it
          would be possible in theory to achieve cooling of up to -47°C
          under the same conditions, if the “ideal” Peltier element –
          yet to be invented – could be used: “With this very simple
          technology, large amounts of hot solid, liquid or gaseous
          materials could be cooled to well below room temperature
          without any energy consumption.”<br>
          <br>
          The passive thermal circuit could also be used as often as
          desired, without the need to connect it to a power supply.
          However, Schilling admits that a large-scale application of
          the technique is still a long way off. One reason for this is
          that the Peltier elements currently available are not
          efficient enough. Furthermore, the current set-up requires the
          use of superconducting inductors to minimize electric losses.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Established perceptions challenged<br>
          </b>The UZH physicist considers the work more significant than
          a mere “proof-of-principle” study: “At first sight, the
          experiments appear to be a kind of thermodynamic magic,
          thereby challenging to some extent our traditional perceptions
          of the flow of heat.”<br>

          <b><br>
          </b>When put under pressure, plastic crystals of
          neopentylglycol yield huge cooling effects – enough that they
          are competitive with conventional coolants. In addition, the
          material is inexpensive, widely available and functions at
          close to room temperature. Details are published in the
          journal Nature Communications.<br>
          <br>
          The gases currently used in the vast majority of refrigerators
          and air conditioners —hydrofluorocarbons and hydrocarbons
          (HFCs and HCs) — are toxic and flammable. When they leak into
          the air, they also contribute to global warming.<br>
          <br>
          “Refrigerators and air conditioners based on HFCs and HCs are
          also relatively inefficient,” said Dr Xavier Moya, from the
          University of Cambridge, who led the research with Professor
          Josep Lluís Tamarit, from the Universitat Politècnica de
          Catalunya. “That’s important because refrigeration and air
          conditioning currently devour a fifth of the energy produced
          worldwide, and demand for cooling is only going up.”<br>
          <br>
          To solve these problems, materials scientists around the world
          have sought alternative solid refrigerants. Moya, a Royal
          Society Research Fellow in Cambridge’s Department of Materials
          Science and Metallurgy, is one of the leaders in this field.<br>
          <br>
          In their newly-published research, Moya and collaborators from
          the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya and the Universitat
          de Barcelona describe the enormous thermal changes under
          pressure achieved with plastic crystals.<br>
          <br>
          Conventional cooling technologies rely on the thermal changes
          that occur when a compressed fluid expands. Most cooling
          devices work by compressing and expanding fluids such as HFCs
          and HCs. As the fluid expands, it decreases in temperature,
          cooling its surroundings.<br>
          <br>
          With solids, cooling is achieved by changing the material’s
          microscopic structure. This change can be achieved by applying
          a magnetic field, an electric field or through mechanic force.
          For decades, these caloric effects have fallen behind the
          thermal changes available in fluids, but the discovery of
          colossal barocaloric effects in a plastic crystal of
          neopentylglycol (NPG) and other related organic compounds has
          levelled the playfield.<br>
          <br>
          Due to the nature of their chemical bonds, organic materials
          are easier to compress, and NPG is widely used in the
          synthesis of paints, polyesters, plasticisers and lubricants.
          It’s not only widely available, but also is inexpensive.<br>
          <br>
          NPG’s molecules, composed of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen, are
          nearly spherical and interact with each other only weakly.
          These loose bonds in its microscopic structure permit the
          molecules to rotate relatively freely.<br>
          <br>
          The word “plastic” in “plastic crystals” refers not to its
          chemical composition but rather to its malleability. Plastic
          crystals lie at the boundary between solids and liquids.<br>
          <br>
          Compressing NPG yields unprecedentedly large thermal changes
          due to molecular reconfiguration. The temperature change
          achieved is comparable with those exploited commercially in
          HFCs and HCs.<br>
          <br>
          The discovery of colossal barocaloric effects in a plastic
          crystal should bring barocaloric materials to the forefront of
          research and development to achieve safe environmentally
          friendly cooling without compromising performance.<br>
          <br>
          Moya is now working with Cambridge Enterprise, the
          commercialisation arm of the University of Cambridge, to bring
          this technology to market.<br>

          Described herein is the use of organic materials in methods of
          barocaloric cooling. The barocaloric effects may be exhibited
          where the organic material is near a non-isochoric phase
          transition, such as a non-isochoric first-order phase
          transition. The organic material has one or more carbon atoms
          and may be an organic compound or a salt thereof. In some
          cases that organic material is a soft matter material, such as
          a plastic crystal or a liquid crystal. The methods may be
          adapted for use of the organic material as a heating agent.<br>

              and other diseases</b><br>
            <i>Scientists trace path of bacterial toxins from the mouth
              to the brain and other tissues</i><i><br>
            </i></div>
          <b><br>
          </b>Researchers are reporting new findings on how bacteria
          involved in gum disease can travel throughout the body,
          exuding toxins connected with Alzheimer's disease, rheumatoid
          arthritis and aspiration pneumonia. They detected evidence of
          the bacteria in brain samples from people with Alzheimer's and
          used mice to show that the bacterium can find its way from the
          mouth to the brain.<br>
          <br>
          The bacterium, Porphyromonas gingivalis, is the bad actor
          involved in periodontitis, the most serious form of gum
          disease. These new findings underscore the importance of good
          dental hygiene as scientists seek ways to better control this
          common bacterial infection.<br>
          <br>
          "Oral hygiene is very important throughout our life, not only
          for having a beautiful smile but also to decrease the risk of
          many serious diseases," said Jan Potempa, PhD, DSc, a
          professor at the University of Louisville School of Dentistry
          and head of the department of microbiology at Jagiellonian
          University in Krakow, Poland. "People with genetic risk
          factors that make them susceptible to rheumatoid arthritis or
          Alzheimer's disease should be extremely concerned with
          preventing gum disease."<br>
          <br>
          While previous researchers have noted the presence of P.
          gingivalis in brain samples from Alzheimer's patients,
          Potempa's team, in collaboration with Cortexyme, Inc., offers
          the strongest evidence to date that the bacterium may actually
          contribute to the development of Alzheimer's disease. Potempa
          will present the research at the American Association of
          Anatomists annual meeting during the 2019 Experimental Biology
          meeting, held April 6-9 in Orlando, Fla.<br>
          <br>
          The researchers compared brain samples from deceased people
          with and without Alzheimer's disease who were roughly the same
          age when they died. They found P. gingivalis was more common
          in samples from Alzheimer's patients, evidenced by the
          bacterium's DNA fingerprint and the presence of its key
          toxins, known as gingipains.<br>
          <br>
          In studies using mice, they showed P. gingivalis can move from
          the mouth to the brain and that this migration can be blocked
          by chemicals that interact with gingipains. An experimental
          drug that blocks gingipains, known as COR388, is currently in
          phase 1 clinical trials for Alzheimer's disease. Cortexyme,
          Inc. and Potempa's team are working on other compounds that
          block enzymes important to P. gingivalis and other gum
          bacteria in hopes of interrupting their role in advancing
          Alzheimer's and other diseases.<br>
          <br>
          The researchers also report evidence on the bacterium's role
          in the autoimmune disease rheumatoid arthritis, as well as
          aspiration pneumonia, a lung infection caused by inhaling food
          or saliva.<br>
          <br>
          "P. gingivalis's main toxins, the enzymes the bacterium need
          to exert its devilish tasks, are good targets for potential
          new medical interventions to counteract a variety of
          diseases," said Potempa. "The beauty of such approaches in
          comparison to antibiotics is that such interventions are aimed
          only at key pathogens, leaving alone good, commensal bacteria,
          which we need."<br>
          <br>
          P. gingivalis commonly begins to infiltrate the gums during
          the teenage years. About one in five people under age 30 have
          low levels of the bacterium in their gums. While it is not
          harmful in most people, if it grows to large numbers the
          bacteria provoke the body's immune system to create
          inflammation, leading to redness, swelling, bleeding and the
          erosion of gum tissue.<br>
          <br>
          Making matters worse, P. gingivalis even causes benign
          bacteria in the mouth to change their activities and further
          increase the immune response. Bacteria can travel from the
          mouth into the bloodstream through the simple act of chewing
          or brushing teeth.<br>
          <br>
          The best way to prevent P. gingivalis from growing out of
          control is by brushing and flossing regularly and visiting a
          dental hygienist at least once a year, Potempa said. Smokers
          and older people are at increased risk for infection. Genetic
          factors are also thought to play a role, but they are not well
          understood.<br>

          <div align="center"><b>Taking a cue from spider webs, UCLA
              researchers snag fresh water with vapor capture system</b><br>
          </div>
          <br>
          Inspired by how dew drops form on spider webs, UCLA engineers
          and mathematicians have designed a unique and effective water
          vapor capture system that could be used to produce clean,
          fresh water, or to recycle industrial water that would
          otherwise be wasted.<br>
          <br>
          Their system is a dense array of parallel cotton threads
          strung vertically, with a steady stream of water droplets
          flowing down the strings. Rising water vapor, pushed upward by
          a fan, is captured by the “web” of water droplets and
          condenses. The resulting water is then moved into a collecting
          container.<br>
          <br>
          The researchers reported a 200 percent increase in efficiency
          using this method compared to existing technologies designed
          to capture water vapor.<br>
          <br>
          The study was published in Science Advances and includes a
          theoretical model of the system and experimental results from
          a prototype.<br>
          <br>
          In addition to harvesting water from the atmosphere, the
          method could be used to produce clean water from the
          evaporation of high-salinity wastewaters, such as those
          produced from oil and gas production, or from irrigation
          runoff.<br>
          <br>
          It could also be used to capture steam escaping from cooling
          towers in power plants and industrial facilities. The captured
          water could then be recycled back into the cooling system.<br>
          <br>
          “The growing global concern over the scarcity of fresh water
          has motivated the development of economically feasible ways to
          capture water vapor,” said Sungtaek Ju, professor of
          mechanical and aerospace engineering at the UCLA Samueli
          School of Engineering and the principal investigator of the
          study. “This idea of imitating the natural rain cycle to
          produce clean water, called ‘the
          humidification-dehumidification process,’ has been around for
          quite some time. However, making such a system that’s
          inexpensive to build and operate has been a major challenge.
          Our system is inexpensive, lightweight and energy-efficient.
          These factors can potentially help overcome challenges for its
          adoption.”<br>
          <br>
          Some proposed water vapor capture methods have used chilled
          metal to make water vapor condense on a surface. But limited
          surface areas, as well as weight, material and manufacturing
          costs, have slowed their adoption. Similarly, methods using
          spray nozzles or electric fields use too much electricity to
          be viable.<br>
          <br>
          A key element in the UCLA team’s system is its ability to
          consistently generate water droplets of the same size and
          constant flowing speed. These water beads enable the system to
          effectively capture water vapor, without causing significant
          pressure drop, and hence fan power consumption.<br>
          <br>
          “The liquid beads form highly curved surfaces that enhance the
          rate at which water vapor diffuses through the air,” said
          Abolfazl Sadeghpour, a UCLA mechanical engineering graduate
          student and a co-lead author of the study. “Simply said, this
          is analogous to a snowball rolling downhill. The beads are
          picking up water vapor as they travel down. And while a drop
          may seem small, think of an entire array of threads working
          constantly. The water vapor harvested could add up to quite a
          bit.”<br>

            Abstract</b><br>
          Growing concern over the scarcity of freshwater motivates the
          development of compact and economic vapor capture methods for
          distributed thermal desalination or harvesting of water. We
          report a study of water vapor condensation on cold liquid
          beads traveling down a massive array of vertical cotton
          threads that act as pseudo-superhydrophilic surfaces. These
          liquid beads form through intrinsic flow instability and offer
          localized high-curvature surfaces that enhance vapor diffusion
          toward the liquid surface, a critical rate-limiting step. As
          the liquid flow rate increases, the bead spacing decreases,
          whereas the bead size and speed stay nearly constant. The
          resulting increase in the spatial bead density leads to mass
          transfer conductances and hence condensation rates per volume
          that are almost three times higher than the best reported
          values. Parallel and contiguous gas flow paths also result in
          a substantial reduction in gas pressure drop and hence
          electric fan power consumption.<b><br>

          The cooling system methodology created by a team led by
          Professors Stefan Seelecke and Andreas Schütze at Saarland
          University is technically not new in concept, but it is the
          best example of taking advantage of an interesting memory
          metal called Nitinol and it’s known effects of soaking up heat
          while it gets bent and releasing the heat when it straightens
          out.<br>
          <br>
          The cooling system is made of a cylindrical chamber with a
          rotor that has nitinol metal strings running along the length.
          There is a cam system that flexes the wire as it rotates for
          1/2 the revolution. During this 1/2, the wires soak up heat in
          that compartment, which cools the compartment down. When the
          wires goes into the other side of the chamber, they are
          allowed to straighten up and they release a lot of heat, which
          heats up that compartment.<br>
          <br>
          There is air moving through the devices to move both the hot
          and cold air. The claims from the university is that it is
          about twice as efficient as a heat pump. As you know from the
          examples above that a heat pump could have a COP of 2.0 or 3.0
          easily. That means that this new Nitinol cooling device would
          have a COP of 4.0-6.0 or 400-600% more work done than the
          motor takes to rotate the cylinder!<br>
          <br>
          Although the recent buzz has been talking about this latest
          development as if it is new, but the university has been at
          this project for several years. Read this to see where their
          thought process came from as well as their funding. <br>

              cool refrigerators</b><br>
          </div>
          <b><br>
          </b>Saarland University, Germany, reports that its engineers
          are using shape memory alloys to develop a new method of
          cooling in which heat and cold are transferred by a
          nickel-titanium alloy...<br>
          <br>
          If a nickel-titanium wire or sheet is deformed or pulled in
          tension, the crystal lattice structure can change, creating
          strain within the material. This change in the crystal
          structure, known as a phase transition, causes the shape
          memory alloy to become hotter. If the stressed sample is
          allowed to relax after temperature equalization with the
          environment, it undergoes substantial cooling to a temperature
          about 20 Centigrade degrees below ambient temperature. ‘<br>
          <br>
          "The basic idea was to remove heat from a space – like the
          interior of a refrigerator – by allowing a pre-stressed,
          super-elastic shape memory material to relax and thus cool
          significantly. The heat taken up in this process is then
          released externally to the surroundings. The SMA is then
          re-stressed in the surroundings, thereby raising its
          temperature, before the cycle begins again," explains Stefan
          Seelecke, Professor for Intelligent Material Systems at
          Saarland University.<br>
          <br>
          In the experimental and modelling studies carried out so far,
          the researchers at Saarland University and the Center for
          Mechatronics and Automation Technology (ZeMA) in Saarbrücken
          have demonstrated that this type of cooling works, and that it
          can be used in practice. They used a model system to determine
          how to optimize the efficiency of the cooling process,
          examining such factors as how strongly the material has to be
          elongated or bent in order to achieve a certain cooling
          performance, or whether the process is more effective when
          carried out slowly or more rapidly. A thermal imaging camera
          was deployed to analyze precisely how the heating and cooling
          stages proceed.<br>
          <br>
          The German Research Foundation, which has been funding the
          project for the last three years, has agreed to invest a
          further 500,000 euros. In total, the project has brought
          around 950,000 euros in funding to the region.<br>

            [ Excerpt ] <br>
            Covert Cannibalism<br>
          </b>We return to the Adam and Eve Story by Thomas Chan who
          among many other things did some conceptual work on the impact
          of magnetism on the body and society.&nbsp; Scientists, then
          Hahnemann College famous for establishing the first
          homeopathic training facility in 1848-and now is Drexel
          University, discovered the following:<br>
          <br>
          They put a batchful of mice, all genetically the same strain,
          in aluminum containers, about six inches or so in diameter,
          half in a magnetic field environment the same as we live
          in&nbsp; [or used to live in] and the other half in a magnetic
          equivalent to being halfway between the Earth and Moon.&nbsp;
          Both sets of cylinders had the same physical environment, the
          same number of male and female mice, the same food, the same
          lighting, the same play environment, and the same water
          supply.&nbsp; After three months the mice in the low-density
          cylinders all suffered the same effects:&nbsp; first, they all
          simply came apart, all in their protein structure; and second,
          over 35% suffered visible cancers which could be considered
          head-to-toes.&nbsp; No analysis was made of internal cancers
          [they probably did not want to know].<br>
          <br>
          Did those words stick in your mind?&nbsp; The aluminum mice
          simply came apart in their protein structure!&nbsp; Proteins
          are a necessary element in your body for living. Some of
          proteins are sensitive to the magnetosphere.&nbsp; Proteins
          called cryptochromes, align as magnetosensing devices in our
          bodies.&nbsp; And once the proteins were defeated, the mice
          got cancer. <br>
          <br>
          Chan Thomas called the two scientists, who invited him to
          Hahnemann Medical College for a week to discuss their mutual
          studies. <br>
          <br>
          They told Thomas that there was something that they had not
          released to the press, and was generally not known.<br>
          <br>
          The first thing they told Thomas as that the mice turned
          criminal in their low-density magnetic filed
          environment.&nbsp; Chan inquired on how mice could turn
          criminal.<br>
          <br>
          He was told:<br>
          <br>
          Very simple.&nbsp; There are basic end-cruelties for almost
          all mammals; mice and humans are no exception.&nbsp;
          Cannibalism is the ultimate cruelty, and they turned
          cannibalistic.&nbsp; Even though they had plenty of the same
          food as the mice in the normal magnetic field strength
          cylinders, they indulged in cannibalism as a preference.&nbsp;
          The mice in the normal cylinder treated each other
          normally-and ate only their normal food.&nbsp; Then the
          scientist paused.<br>
          <br>
          Ponder this for a moment.&nbsp; This experiment occurred in a
          lab and at a time where our planet's atmosphere was relatively
          stable and pure compared to today.&nbsp; Today we find
          ourselves in a devious laboratory whose end result is already
          known to science and the powers-that-be:<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Saturated by aluminum nanoparticles which
          would be the equivalent of the mice in the aluminum cylinders.
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Interruption of normal protein activity
          causes a living thing to fall apart with over a third
          developing cancer.<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our magnetosphere is wavering and about to
          plummet in electrical response to the sun.<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have been seeded to crave human flesh
          through blood particles in geo-engineering projects spanning
          to human DNA entangled in biotech (GMO) foods...<br>
          <br>
          <b>Forcible Rape<br>
          </b>"There is another thing which really confounds us," he
          continued.&nbsp; "These same mice who turned cannibalistic
          indulged in forcible rape literally around the clock.&nbsp;
          That and murder, are the other end-cruelties."<br>
          <br>
          Chan inquired, "Is it possible that you can tell the
          difference between rape and forcible rape in mice?"&nbsp; "It
          seems impossible to differentiate in mice."<br>
          <br>
          The scientist responded, "Oh yes, it happens all the time in
          the animal world.&nbsp; For instance, sea lions and sea
          elephants.&nbsp; They use forcible rape commonly.&nbsp; In
          these mice, almost every act of sexual intercourse in the low
          magnetic cylinder was forcible rape, whereas in the normal
          cylinders, we never saw it."<br>
          <br>
          Chan commented, "Of course, in humans it's easy to
          differentiate between forcible rape and rape."<br>
          <br>
          The scientist continued, "Legally, it may not be so easy to
          differentiate, but morally I guess it's easy.&nbsp; But what
          we're interested in here is why they resorted to forcible rape
          just because the environment of a low-density magnetic
          field.&nbsp; We were hoping you could give us at least a
          concept to go on."<br>
          <br>
          Chan relayed that his studies involved legends concerning
          civilizations in the years leading to cataclysm, when Earth's
          magnetic field was decreasing at an increasing rate as they
          approached the null zone; and in every instance it appeared
          that criminality-essentially man's inhumanity to man-appeared
          to become overwhelming.&nbsp; Even the Navajo Indians spoke of
          it in their legends of their approach to a cataclysm, but they
          called it adultery. It is quite possible that their
          definitions of rape in any form, be forcible or not, was
          included in the term "adultery".<br>
          <br>
          Chan was astonished that in all his studies he found it
          strange that he had not associated rape and forcible rape with
          overwhelming criminality as a precursor period preceding a
          cataclysm. <br>
          <br>
          Chan provided the scientists his conclusion:<br>
          <br>
          He would commit that a lowering or lowered magnetic field
          environment could give its occupants a sense of impending
          doom.&nbsp; Certainly there would be a feeling that something
          out of control as destroying them, so why not get what they
          want irrespective of consequences? In the case of humans,
          those without empathy turned criminal first.&nbsp; In the case
          of animals, it is probably proper to assume that there is
          little or no empathy there to start with...<br>
          <br>
          During the 1960's and 1970's Thomas was giving speeches about
          cataclysmology all over the United States.&nbsp; He predicted
          with a little help from his friends that by 1990 crime would
          be at such a level in our country that law enforcement
          agencies of our nation would not be able to cope with it. <br>
          <br>
          In general, Thomas stated, "and it is my experience that it is
          true that if you are the victim of a crime, in most instances,
          law enforcement is too busy to investigate except in high
          profile situations or when the bottom line is funding for the
          department.&nbsp; Lest you think otherwise the crime side
          includes: confidence artists, top executives, bankers, Savings
          and Loan executives, management personnel, family men and
          women, thieves, burglars, addicts, those who sell addiction,
          murderers, and almost any level or society from notables to
          the homeless."<br>

          </b>The cooling system methodology created by a team led by
          Professors Stefan Seelecke and Andreas Schütze at Saarland
          University is technically not new in concept, but it is the
          best example of taking advantage of an interesting memory
          metal called Nitinol and it’s known effects of soaking up heat
          while it gets bent and releasing the heat when it straightens
          out.<br>
          <br>
          The cooling system is made of a cylindrical chamber with a
          rotor that has nitinol metal strings running along the length.
          There is a cam system that flexes the wire as it rotates for
          1/2 the revolution. During this 1/2, the wires soak up heat in
          that compartment, which cools the compartment down. When the
          wires goes into the other side of the chamber, they are
          allowed to straighten up and they release a lot of heat, which
          heats up that compartment.<br>
          <br>
          There is air moving through the devices to move both the hot
          and cold air. The claims from the university is that it is
          about twice as efficient as a heat pump. As you know from the
          examples above that a heat pump could have a COP of 2.0 or 3.0
          easily. That means that this new Nitinol cooling device would
          have a COP of 4.0-6.0 or 400-600% more work done than the
          motor takes to rotate the cylinder!<br>
          <br>
          Although the recent buzz has been talking about this latest
          development as if it is new, but the university has been at
          this project for several years. Read this to see where their
          thought process came from as well as their funding. <br>

              cool refrigerators</b><br>
          </div>
          <br>
          Saarland University, Germany, reports that its engineers are
          using shape memory alloys to develop a new method of cooling
          in which heat and cold are transferred by a nickel-titanium
          alloy...<br>
          <br>
          If a nickel-titanium wire or sheet is deformed or pulled in
          tension, the crystal lattice structure can change, creating
          strain within the material. This change in the crystal
          structure, known as a phase transition, causes the shape
          memory alloy to become hotter. If the stressed sample is
          allowed to relax after temperature equalization with the
          environment, it undergoes substantial cooling to a temperature
          about 20 Centigrade degrees below ambient temperature. ‘<br>
          <br>
          "The basic idea was to remove heat from a space – like the
          interior of a refrigerator – by allowing a pre-stressed,
          super-elastic shape memory material to relax and thus cool
          significantly. The heat taken up in this process is then
          released externally to the surroundings. The SMA is then
          re-stressed in the surroundings, thereby raising its
          temperature, before the cycle begins again," explains Stefan
          Seelecke, Professor for Intelligent Material Systems at
          Saarland University.<br>
          <br>
          In the experimental and modelling studies carried out so far,
          the researchers at Saarland University and the Center for
          Mechatronics and Automation Technology (ZeMA) in Saarbrücken
          have demonstrated that this type of cooling works, and that it
          can be used in practice. They used a model system to determine
          how to optimize the efficiency of the cooling process,
          examining such factors as how strongly the material has to be
          elongated or bent in order to achieve a certain cooling
          performance, or whether the process is more effective when
          carried out slowly or more rapidly. A thermal imaging camera
          was deployed to analyze precisely how the heating and cooling
          stages proceed.<br>
          <br>
          The German Research Foundation, which has been funding the
          project for the last three years, has agreed to invest a
          further 500,000 euros. In total, the project has brought
          around 950,000 euros in funding to the region.<br>

          <b><br>
          </b>The most influential unpublished work in the history of
          psychology. When Carl Jung embarked on an extended
          self-exploration he called his “confrontation with the
          unconscious,” the heart of it was The Red Book, a large,
          illuminated volume he created between 1914 and 1930. Here he
          developed his principle theories—of the archetypes, the
          collective unconscious, and the process of individuation—that
          transformed psychotherapy from a practice concerned with
          treatment of the sick into a means for higher development of
          the personality. While Jung considered The Red Book to be his
          most important work, only a handful of people have ever seen
          it. Now, in a complete facsimile and translation, it is
          available to scholars and the general public. It is an
          astonishing example of calligraphy and art on a par with The
          Book of Kells and the illuminated manuscripts of William
          Blake. This publication of The Red Book is a watershed that
          will cast new light on the making of modern psychology. 212

              tissue with electricity but no incisions</b><br>
          </div>
          <br>
          Traditional surgery to reshape a nose or ear entails cutting
          and suturing, sometimes followed by long recovery times and
          scars. But now, researchers have developed a "molecular
          surgery" process that uses tiny needles, electric current and
          3D-printed molds to quickly reshape living tissue with no
          incisions, scarring or recovery time. The technique even shows
          promise as a way to fix immobile joints or as a noninvasive
          alternative to laser eye surgery...<br>
          <br>
          "We envision this new technique as a low-cost office procedure
          done under local anesthesia," says Michael Hill, Ph.D., one of
          the project's principal investigators, who will discuss the
          work at the meeting. "The whole process would take about five
          minutes."<br>
          <br>
          Hill, who is at Occidental College, became involved in this
          project when Brian Wong, M.D., Ph.D., who is at the University
          of California, Irvine, asked for help in developing a
          noninvasive technique to reshape cartilage. Such a method
          would be useful for cosmetic surgery procedures, such as
          making a nose more attractive. But the method also could help
          fix problems, such as a deviated septum, or conditions for
          which no good treatments exist, such as joint contractures
          caused by stroke or cerebral palsy. Having suffered through
          painful deviated septum surgery himself, Hill understands what
          patients go through, and was excited to join a project to
          develop a better strategy.<br>
          <br>
          Wong was already an expert in one alternative technique that
          uses an infrared laser to heat cartilage, making it flexible
          enough to reshape. "The problem is, that technique is
          expensive, and it's hard to heat the cartilage enough so that
          it's malleable without killing the tissue," Hill says. To find
          a more practical approach, Wong's team began experimenting
          with passing current through cartilage to heat it up. The
          method indeed allowed them to reshape tissue, but, curiously,
          not by warming it. Wong turned to Hill to determine just how
          the new method was working and to refine it to prevent tissue
          damage.<br>
          <br>
          Cartilage is made up of tiny rigid fibers of collagen loosely
          woven together by biopolymers. Its structure resembles
          spaghetti that's been randomly dumped on a counter, with the
          individual strands tied together with thread. "If you picked
          it up, the strands wouldn't fall apart, but it would be
          floppy," Hill says. Cartilage also contains negatively charged
          proteins and positively charged sodium ions. Cartilage with a
          greater density of these charged particles is stiffer than
          cartilage with a lower charge density.<br>
          <br>
          Hill's group discovered that passing current through cartilage
          electrolyzes water in the tissue, converting the water into
          oxygen and hydrogen ions, or protons. The positive charge of
          the protons cancels out the negative charge on the proteins,
          reducing charge density and making the cartilage more
          malleable. "Once the tissue is floppy," he says, "you can mold
          it to whatever shape you want."<br>
          <br>
          The team tested the method on a rabbit whose ears normally
          stand upright. They used a mold to hold one ear bent over in
          the desired new shape. If they had then removed the mold
          without applying a current, the rabbit's ear would have sprung
          back into its original upright position, just like a human ear
          would. But by inserting microneedle electrodes into the ear at
          the bend and pulsing current through them with the mold in
          place, they briefly softened the cartilage at the bend site
          without damage. Turning off the current then allowed the
          cartilage to harden in its new shape, after which the mold was
          removed.<br>
          <br>
          To achieve this outcome with traditional methods, a surgeon
          would have to cut through the skin and cartilage and then
          stick the pieces back together. That can lead to formation of
          scar tissue at the joint. That scar tissue must sometimes be
          removed in subsequent operations, Hill says. By avoiding this
          mechanical damage to the cartilage, the molecular surgery
          technique causes no scarring and no pain.<br>
          <br>
          The researchers are exploring licensing options for the
          cartilage technique with medical device companies. They're
          also investigating applications in other types of collagen
          tissue, such as tendons and corneas. In an eye, cornea shape
          affects vision, with too much curvature causing
          nearsightedness, for example. Many hurdles must be overcome
          before this method could be used to correct a person's vision,
          but preliminary animal experiments have had promising results.
          The researchers used a 3D printer to make a contact lens.
          After painting electrodes on it, they put the contact lens on
          the eye. Applying current allowed them to temporarily soften
          the cornea and change its curvature.<br>

          <b><br>
            Highlights<br>
          </b>Geobacter nanowires are made up of micrometer-long
          polymerization of cytochrome OmcS<br>
          All hemes are closely stacked (&lt;4–6 Å), providing a

          We show that these are the same filaments that were earlier
          thought as type IV pili<br>
          This structure explains the molecular basis for electron

          <b><br>
            Summary<br>
          </b>Long-range (&gt;10 µm) transport of electrons along
          networks of Geobacter sulfurreducens protein filaments, known
          as microbial nanowires, has been invoked to explain a wide
          range of globally important redox phenomena. These nanowires
          were previously thought to be type IV pili composed of PilA
          protein. Here, we report a 3.7 Å resolution cryoelectron
          microscopy structure, which surprisingly reveals that, rather
          than PilA, G. sulfurreducens nanowires are assembled by
          micrometer-long polymerization of the hexaheme cytochrome
          OmcS, with hemes packed within ~3.5–6 Å of each other. The
          inter-subunit interfaces show unique structural elements such
          as inter-subunit parallel-stacked hemes and axial coordination
          of heme by histidines from neighboring subunits. Wild-type
          OmcS filaments show 100-fold greater conductivity than other
          filaments from a ? omcS strain, highlighting the importance of
          OmcS to conductivity in these nanowires. This structure
          explains the remarkable capacity of soil bacteria to transport
          electrons to remote electron acceptors for respiration and
          energy sharing.<br>

            </b></div>
          <b>BACKGROUND<br>
          </b>Underwater diving, as a human activity, is the practice of
          descending below the water's surface to interact with the
          environment. Immersion in water and exposure to high ambient
          pressure have physiological effects that limit the depths and
          duration possible in ambient pressure diving. This is because
          humans are not physiologically and anatomically well adapted
          to the environmental conditions of diving. In particular, in
          cold-water environments {e.g., water at less than 10 °C) a
          diver is at risk of developing hypothermia. Current diving
          garments only allow a diver to stay in the water for less than
          an hour. In some cases, however, divers need to stay in the
          water for more than an hour, such as for deep-sea exploration
          or for military recognizance missions. Accordingly, there
          remains a need in the art for improved diving garments that
          reduce a diver's risk of hypothermia, especially during long
          dive times.<br>
          <b><br>
            SUMMARY<br>
          </b>Provided herein are thermally insulating fabrics
          comprising a polymer infused with a high molecular weight gas.
          Also provided herein is a flexible garment comprising a
          neoprene foam infused with a high molecular weight gas. In
          some embodiments, the flexible garment is a dive suit, such as
          a wetsuit, a variable volume drysuit, a hot water wetsuit, or
          an active diver thermal protection system.<br>
          <br>
          Also provided herein is a method for preparing the thermally
          insulating fabrics described herein comprising placing fabric
          in a sealed container; and filling the container with an
          insulating gas. In some embodiments, the fabric comprises a
          polymeric material {e.g., neoprene, polystyrene, or nitrile
          butadiene rubber). In some embodiments, the insulating gas is
          a high molecular weight gas, such as ona noble gas (e.g.,
          xenon, krypton, or argon).<br>
          <br>
          Also provided herein are methods for protecting a diver in
          cold water environments, comprising providing a diver with a
          thermally insulating fabric (e.g., such as those used in dive

          <div align="center"><b>It’s a one-way street for sound waves
              in this new technology</b><br>
            <b>By Jim Shelton</b><br>
          </div>
          <b><br>
          </b>Imagine being able to hear people whispering in the next
          room, while the raucous party in your own room is inaudible to
          the whisperers. Yale researchers have found a way to do just
          that — make sound flow in one direction — within a fundamental
          technology found in everything from cell phones to
          gravitational wave detectors.<br>
          <br>
          What’s more, the researchers have used the same idea to
          control the flow of heat in one direction. The discovery
          offers new possibilities for enhancing electronic devices that
          use acoustic resonators.<br>
          <br>
          The findings, from the lab of Yale’s Jack Harris, are
          published in the April 4 online edition of the journal Nature.<br>
          <br>
          “This is an experiment in which we make a one-way route for
          sound waves,” said Harris, a Yale physics professor and the
          study’s principal investigator. “Specifically, we have two
          acoustic resonators. Sound stored in the first resonator can
          leak into the second, but not vice versa.”<br>
          <br>
          Harris said his team was able to achieve the result with a
          “tuning knob” — a laser setting, actually — that can weaken or
          strengthen a sound wave, depending on the sound wave’s
          direction.<br>
          <br>
          Then the researchers took their experiment to a different
          level. Because heat consists mostly of vibrations, they
          applied the same ideas to the flow of heat from one object to
          another.<br>
          <b><br>
          </b>“By using our one-way sound trick, we can make heat flow
          from point A to point B, or from B to A, regardless of which
          one is colder or hotter,” Harris said. “This would be like
          dropping an ice cube into a glass of hot water and having the
          ice cubes get colder and colder while the water around them
          gets warmer and warmer. Then, by changing a single setting on
          our laser, heat is made to flow the usual way, and the ice
          cubes gradually warm and melt while the liquid water cools a
          bit. Though in our experiments it’s not ice cubes and water
          that are exchanging heat, but rather two acoustic resonators.”<br>
          <br>
          Although some of the most basic examples of acoustic
          resonators are found in musical instruments or even automobile
          exhaust pipes, they’re also found in a variety of electronics.
          They are used as sensors, filters, and transducers because of
          their compatibility with a wide range of materials,
          frequencies, and fabrication processes.<br>

              phonon modes in an optomechanical system</b><br>

            Abstract<br>
          </b>Mechanical resonators are important components of devices
          that range from gravitational wave detectors to cellular
          telephones. They serve as high-performance transducers,
          sensors and filters by offering low dissipation, tunable
          coupling to diverse physical systems, and compatibility with a
          wide range of frequencies, materials and fabrication
          processes. Systems of mechanical resonators typically obey
          reciprocity, which ensures that the phonon transmission
          coefficient between any two resonators is independent of the
          direction of transmission1,2. Reciprocity must be broken to
          realize devices (such as isolators and circulators) that
          provide one-way propagation of acoustic energy between
          resonators. Such devices are crucial for protecting active
          elements, mitigating noise and operating full-duplex
          transceivers. Until now, nonreciprocal phononic devices have
          not simultaneously combined the features necessary for robust
          operation: strong nonreciprocity, in situ tunability, compact
          integration and continuous operation. Furthermore, they have
          been applied only to coherent signals (rather than
          fluctuations or noise), and have been realized exclusively in
          travelling-wave systems (rather than resonators). Here we
          describe a scheme that uses the standard cavity-optomechanical
          interaction to produce robust nonreciprocal coupling between
          phononic resonators. This scheme provides about 30 decibels of
          isolation in continuous operation and can be tuned in situ
          simply via the phases of the drive tones applied to the
          cavity. In addition, by directly monitoring the dynamics of
          the resonators we show that this nonreciprocity can control
          thermal fluctuations, and that this control represents a way
          to cool phononic resonators.<br>

          Yale scientists used laser light to gain access to long-lived
          sound waves in crystalline solids as the basis for information
          storage. The result was published online April 2 in the

            Abstract<br>
          </b>Control of long-lived, high-frequency phonons using light
          offers a path towards creating robust quantum links, and could
          lead to tools for precision metrology with applications to
          quantum information processing. Optomechanical systems based
          on bulk acoustic-wave resonators are well suited for this goal
          in light of their high quality factors, and because they do
          not suffer from surface interactions as much as their
          microscale counterparts. However, so far these phonons have
          been accessible only electromechanically, using piezoelectric
          interactions. Here, we demonstrate customizable optomechanical
          coupling to macroscopic phonon modes of a bulk acoustic-wave
          resonator at cryogenic temperatures. These phonon modes, which
          are formed by shaping the surfaces of a crystal into a
          plano-convex phononic resonator, yield appreciable
          optomechanical coupling rates, providing access to high
          acoustic quality factors (4.2?×?107) at high phonon
          frequencies (13?GHz). This simple approach, which uses bulk
          properties rather than nanostructural control, is appealing
          for the ability to engineer optomechanical systems at high
          frequencies that are robust against thermal decoherence.
          Moreover, we show that this optomechanical system yields a
          unique form of dispersive symmetry-breaking that enables
          phonon heating or cooling without an optical cavity.<b><br>

          <b>&nbsp;</b><br>
          An astronomical chart and projection system for mapping
          celestial movement plots the longitudinal positions of
          planets, as measured along the ecliptic, against time in a
          rectilinear coordinate system with each of the planets being
          represented by a line on the chart, such a line being
          designated the "major line" of the planet. The major line
          corresponding to at least one of the planets is repeated at
          fixed longitudinal displacements from itself to generate
          harmonic reproductions, typically at 45 degree intervals.
          These harmonic reproductions allow a user to immediately
          extract aspect information between the planet whose major line
          is harmonically reproduced and other planets, whether or not
          harmonically reproduced. The longitude and time axes
          preferably have a common origin at respective longitude and
          time coordinates corresponding to the vernal equinox, thus
          permitting sidereal and tropical time information to be
          extracted from the chart by simple linear scaling of
          coordinates. The chart is rendered especially useful for
          astronomers by the provision of a two-dimensional reproduction
          of the stars located within a band about the ecliptic. The
          information is color coded in order that the different major
          lines and their harmonics be readily identifiable.<br>

          </div>
          <b>Candida auris fact sheet<br>
          </b>Candida auris (also called C. auris) is a fungus that
          causes serious infections. Patients with C. auris infection,
          their family members and other close contacts, public health
          officials, laboratory staff, and healthcare personnel can all
          help stop it from spreading.<br>
          <b><br>
            Why is Candida auris a problem?<br>
          </b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It causes serious infections. C. auris
          can cause bloodstream infections and even death, particularly
          in hospital and nursing home patients with serious medical
          problems. More than 1 in 3 patients with invasive C. auris
          infection (for example, an infection that affects the blood,
          heart, or brain) die.<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It’s often resistant to medicines.
          Antifungal medicines commonly used to treat Candida infections
          often don’t work for Candida auris. Some C. auris infections
          have been resistant to all three types of antifungal
          medicines.<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It’s becoming more common. Although C.
          auris was just discovered in 2009, it has spread quickly and
          caused infections in more than a dozen countries.<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It’s difficult to identify. C. auris can be
          misidentified as other types of fungi unless specialized
          laboratory technology is used. This misidentification might
          lead to a patient getting the wrong treatment.<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It can spread in hospitals and nursing
          homes. C. auris has caused outbreaks in healthcare facilities
          and can spread through contact with affected patients and
          contaminated surfaces or equipment. Good hand hygiene and
          cleaning in healthcare facilities is important because C.
          auris can live on surfaces for several weeks...<br>

          take a look at a study published last year in the journal
          Emerging Infectious Diseases. This study reviewed 51 cases of
          C. auris infections that had occurred in healthcare facilities
          in New York City from 2016 to 2018. All of the patients
          already had serious medical conditions prior to getting
          infected and ranged in age from 21 to 96 years old. Nearly
          half (45%) of the patients ended up dying within 90 days of
          being diagnosed with C. auris infections. Nearly all (98%) of
          the C. auris samples from 50 of the patients were resistant to
          fluconazole, a commonly used anti-fungal drug. Testing of
          different objects and rooms revealed C. auris in the

          <b>Abstract<br>
          </b>Reconfigurable, ordered matter offers great potential for
          future low-power computer memory by storing information in
          energetically stable configurations. Among these,
          skyrmions—which are topologically protected, robust
          excitations that have been demonstrated in chiral
          magnets1,2,3,4 and in liquid crystals5,6,7—are driving much
          excitement about potential spintronic applications8. These
          information-encoding structures topologically resemble field
          configurations in many other branches of physics and have a
          rich history9, although chiral condensed-matter systems so far
          have yielded realizations only of elementary full and
          fractional skyrmions. Here we describe stable, high-degree
          multi-skyrmion configurations where an arbitrary number of
          antiskyrmions are contained within a larger skyrmion. We call
          these structures skyrmion bags. We demonstrate them
          experimentally and numerically in liquid crystals and
          numerically in micromagnetic simulations either without or
          with magnetostatic effects. We find that skyrmion bags act
          like single skyrmions in pairwise interaction and under the
          influence of current in magnetic materials, and are thus an
          exciting proposition for topological magnetic storage and
          logic devices....<br>

          scars. But now, researchers have developed a "molecular
          surgery" process that uses tiny needles, electric current and
          3D-printed molds to quickly reshape living tissue with no
          incisions, scarring or recovery time. The technique even shows
          promise as a way to fix immobile joints or as a noninvasive
          alternative to laser eye surgery...<br>
          <br>
          "We envision this new technique as a low-cost office procedure
          done under local anesthesia," says Michael Hill, Ph.D., one of
          the project's principal investigators, who will discuss the
          work at the meeting. "The whole process would take about five
          minutes."<br>
          <br>
          Hill, who is at Occidental College, became involved in this
          project when Brian Wong, M.D., Ph.D., who is at the University
          of California, Irvine, asked for help in developing a
          noninvasive technique to reshape cartilage. Such a method
          would be useful for cosmetic surgery procedures, such as
          making a nose more attractive. But the method also could help
          fix problems, such as a deviated septum, or conditions for
          which no good treatments exist, such as joint contractures
          caused by stroke or cerebral palsy. Having suffered through
          painful deviated septum surgery himself, Hill understands what
          patients go through, and was excited to join a project to
          develop a better strategy.<br>
          <br>
          Wong was already an expert in one alternative technique that
          uses an infrared laser to heat cartilage, making it flexible
          enough to reshape. "The problem is, that technique is
          expensive, and it's hard to heat the cartilage enough so that
          it's malleable without killing the tissue," Hill says. To find
          a more practical approach, Wong's team began experimenting
          with passing current through cartilage to heat it up. The
          method indeed allowed them to reshape tissue, but, curiously,
          not by warming it. Wong turned to Hill to determine just how
          the new method was working and to refine it to prevent tissue
          damage.<br>
          <br>
          Cartilage is made up of tiny rigid fibers of collagen loosely
          woven together by biopolymers. Its structure resembles
          spaghetti that's been randomly dumped on a counter, with the
          individual strands tied together with thread. "If you picked
          it up, the strands wouldn't fall apart, but it would be
          floppy," Hill says. Cartilage also contains negatively charged
          proteins and positively charged sodium ions. Cartilage with a
          greater density of these charged particles is stiffer than
          cartilage with a lower charge density.<br>
          <br>
          Hill's group discovered that passing current through cartilage
          electrolyzes water in the tissue, converting the water into
          oxygen and hydrogen ions, or protons. The positive charge of
          the protons cancels out the negative charge on the proteins,
          reducing charge density and making the cartilage more
          malleable. "Once the tissue is floppy," he says, "you can mold
          it to whatever shape you want."<br>
          <br>
          The team tested the method on a rabbit whose ears normally
          stand upright. They used a mold to hold one ear bent over in
          the desired new shape. If they had then removed the mold
          without applying a current, the rabbit's ear would have sprung
          back into its original upright position, just like a human ear
          would. But by inserting microneedle electrodes into the ear at
          the bend and pulsing current through them with the mold in
          place, they briefly softened the cartilage at the bend site
          without damage. Turning off the current then allowed the
          cartilage to harden in its new shape, after which the mold was
          removed.<br>
          <br>
          To achieve this outcome with traditional methods, a surgeon
          would have to cut through the skin and cartilage and then
          stick the pieces back together. That can lead to formation of
          scar tissue at the joint. That scar tissue must sometimes be
          removed in subsequent operations, Hill says. By avoiding this
          mechanical damage to the cartilage, the molecular surgery
          technique causes no scarring and no pain.<br>
          <br>
          The researchers are exploring licensing options for the
          cartilage technique with medical device companies. They're
          also investigating applications in other types of collagen
          tissue, such as tendons and corneas. In an eye, cornea shape
          affects vision, with too much curvature causing
          nearsightedness, for example. Many hurdles must be overcome
          before this method could be used to correct a person's vision,
          but preliminary animal experiments have had promising results.
          The researchers used a 3D printer to make a contact lens.
          After painting electrodes on it, they put the contact lens on
          the eye. Applying current allowed them to temporarily soften
          the cornea and change its curvature.<br>

            Highlights<br>
          </b>Geobacter nanowires are made up of micrometer-long
          polymerization of cytochrome OmcS<br>
          All hemes are closely stacked (&lt;4–6 Å), providing a
          continuous path for electron flow<br>
          We show that these are the same filaments that were earlier
          thought as type IV pili<br>
          This structure explains the molecular basis for electron

          <b><br>
            Summary<br>
          </b>Long-range (&gt;10 µm) transport of electrons along
          networks of Geobacter sulfurreducens protein filaments, known
          as microbial nanowires, has been invoked to explain a wide
          range of globally important redox phenomena. These nanowires
          were previously thought to be type IV pili composed of PilA
          protein. Here, we report a 3.7 Å resolution cryoelectron
          microscopy structure, which surprisingly reveals that, rather
          than PilA, G. sulfurreducens nanowires are assembled by
          micrometer-long polymerization of the hexaheme cytochrome
          OmcS, with hemes packed within ~3.5–6 Å of each other. The
          inter-subunit interfaces show unique structural elements such
          as inter-subunit parallel-stacked hemes and axial coordination
          of heme by histidines from neighboring subunits. Wild-type
          OmcS filaments show 100-fold greater conductivity than other
          filaments from a ? omcS strain, highlighting the importance of
          OmcS to conductivity in these nanowires. This structure
          explains the remarkable capacity of soil bacteria to transport
          electrons to remote electron acceptors for respiration and
          energy sharing.<br>

          for preparing them and methods of using them, in particular as
          diving suit materials for enhanced persistence in cold-water
          dives.<br>
          <b><br>
            BACKGROUND<br>
          </b>Underwater diving, as a human activity, is the practice of
          descending below the water's surface to interact with the
          environment. Immersion in water and exposure to high ambient
          pressure have physiological effects that limit the depths and
          duration possible in ambient pressure diving. This is because
          humans are not physiologically and anatomically well adapted
          to the environmental conditions of diving. In particular, in
          cold-water environments {e.g., water at less than 10 °C) a
          diver is at risk of developing hypothermia. Current diving
          garments only allow a diver to stay in the water for less than
          an hour. In some cases, however, divers need to stay in the
          water for more than an hour, such as for deep-sea exploration
          or for military recognizance missions. Accordingly, there
          remains a need in the art for improved diving garments that
          reduce a diver's risk of hypothermia, especially during long
          dive times.<br>
          <br>
          <b>SUMMARY<br>
            <br>
          </b>Provided herein are thermally insulating fabrics
          comprising a polymer infused with a high molecular weight gas.
          Also provided herein is a flexible garment comprising a
          neoprene foam infused with a high molecular weight gas. In
          some embodiments, the flexible garment is a dive suit, such as

          insulating gas. In some embodiments, the fabric comprises a
          polymeric material {e.g., neoprene, polystyrene, or nitrile
          butadiene rubber). In some embodiments, the insulating gas is
          a high molecular weight gas, such as a noble gas (e.g., xenon,
          krypton, or argon).<br>
          <br>

          Imagine being able to hear people whispering in the next room,
          while the raucous party in your own room is inaudible to the
          whisperers. Yale researchers have found a way to do just that
          — make sound flow in one direction — within a fundamental
          technology found in everything from cell phones to
          gravitational wave detectors.<br>
          <br>
          What’s more, the researchers have used the same idea to
          control the flow of heat in one direction. The discovery
          offers new possibilities for enhancing electronic devices that
          use acoustic resonators.<br>
          <br>
          The findings, from the lab of Yale’s Jack Harris, are
          published in the April 4 online edition of the journal Nature.<br>
          <br>
          “This is an experiment in which we make a one-way route for
          sound waves,” said Harris, a Yale physics professor and the
          study’s principal investigator. “Specifically, we have two
          acoustic resonators. Sound stored in the first resonator can
          leak into the second, but not vice versa.”<br>
          <br>
          Harris said his team was able to achieve the result with a
          “tuning knob” — a laser setting, actually — that can weaken or
          strengthen a sound wave, depending on the sound wave’s
          direction.<br>
          <br>
          Then the researchers took their experiment to a different
          level. Because heat consists mostly of vibrations, they
          applied the same ideas to the flow of heat from one object to
          another.<br>
          <br>
          “By using our one-way sound trick, we can make heat flow from
          point A to point B, or from B to A, regardless of which one is
          colder or hotter,” Harris said. “This would be like dropping
          an ice cube into a glass of hot water and having the ice cubes
          get colder and colder while the water around them gets warmer
          and warmer. Then, by changing a single setting on our laser,
          heat is made to flow the usual way, and the ice cubes
          gradually warm and melt while the liquid water cools a bit.
          Though in our experiments it’s not ice cubes and water that
          are exchanging heat, but rather two acoustic resonators.”<br>
          <br>
          Although some of the most basic examples of acoustic
          resonators are found in musical instruments or even automobile
          exhaust pipes, they’re also found in a variety of electronics.
          They are used as sensors, filters, and transducers because of
          their compatibility with a wide range of materials,
          frequencies, and fabrication processes.<br>

          In the image, a flexible membrane (gray square) serves as an
          acoustic resonator, placed between two mirrors. When laser
          light is trapped between the mirrors, it passes repeatedly
          through the membrane. The force exerted by the laser light is
          used to control the membrane’s vibrations. (Image credit:

          <b>Abstract<br>
          </b>Mechanical resonators are important components of devices
          that range from gravitational wave detectors to cellular
          telephones. They serve as high-performance transducers,
          sensors and filters by offering low dissipation, tunable
          coupling to diverse physical systems, and compatibility with a
          wide range of frequencies, materials and fabrication
          processes. Systems of mechanical resonators typically obey
          reciprocity, which ensures that the phonon transmission
          coefficient between any two resonators is independent of the
          direction of transmission1,2. Reciprocity must be broken to
          realize devices (such as isolators and circulators) that
          provide one-way propagation of acoustic energy between
          resonators. Such devices are crucial for protecting active
          elements, mitigating noise and operating full-duplex
          transceivers. Until now, nonreciprocal phononic
          devices3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11 have not simultaneously combined
          the features necessary for robust operation: strong
          nonreciprocity, in situ tunability, compact integration and
          continuous operation. Furthermore, they have been applied only
          to coherent signals (rather than fluctuations or noise), and
          have been realized exclusively in travelling-wave systems
          (rather than resonators). Here we describe a scheme that uses
          the standard cavity-optomechanical interaction to produce
          robust nonreciprocal coupling between phononic resonators.
          This scheme provides about 30 decibels of isolation in
          continuous operation and can be tuned in situ simply via the
          phases of the drive tones applied to the cavity. In addition,
          by directly monitoring the dynamics of the resonators we show
          that this nonreciprocity can control thermal fluctuations, and
          that this control represents a way to cool phononic
          resonators.<br>

            Abstract<br>
          </b>Control of long-lived, high-frequency phonons using light
          offers a path towards creating robust quantum links, and could
          lead to tools for precision metrology with applications to
          quantum information processing. Optomechanical systems based
          on bulk acoustic-wave resonators are well suited for this goal
          in light of their high quality factors, and because they do
          not suffer from surface interactions as much as their
          microscale counterparts. However, so far these phonons have
          been accessible only electromechanically, using piezoelectric
          interactions. Here, we demonstrate customizable optomechanical
          coupling to macroscopic phonon modes of a bulk acoustic-wave
          resonator at cryogenic temperatures. These phonon modes, which
          are formed by shaping the surfaces of a crystal into a
          plano-convex phononic resonator, yield appreciable
          optomechanical coupling rates, providing access to high
          acoustic quality factors (4.2?×?107) at high phonon
          frequencies (13?GHz). This simple approach, which uses bulk
          properties rather than nanostructural control, is appealing
          for the ability to engineer optomechanical systems at high
          frequencies that are robust against thermal decoherence.
          Moreover, we show that this optomechanical system yields a
          unique form of dispersive symmetry-breaking that enables
          phonon heating or cooling without an optical cavity.<br>

          </b>...The Fort Peck Dam on the upper Missouri River in
          Montana is likewise troubling experts watching a record
          snowpack in the Rocky Mountains. It too is an earthen dam —
          the world’s largest by volume — filled with hydraulic slurry.
          Because it is located on the flat high plains, the dam is
          extremely long, running 21,000 feet — about four miles — from
          end to end. Behind it is a reservoir that is the fifth-largest
          man-made lake in the nation.<br>

          Concern is rising because the coming snow melt coincides with
          seismic activity around the Yellowstone Caldera, one of the

          inclines it to liquification when the ground shakes. Failure

                use and improve plant growth</b><br>
            </div>
            <b> </b><b><br>
            </b>A team of scientists has revealed a new, sustainable way
            for plants to increase carbon dioxide (CO2) uptake for
            photosynthesis while reducing water usage.<br>
            <br>
            The breakthrough was led by a team of plant scientists at
            the University of Glasgow and is published today in the
            journal Science. The researchers used a new, synthetic
            light-activated ion channel, engineered from plant and algal
            virus proteins, to speed up the opening and closing of the
            stomata – pores in the leaves of plants - through which
            carbon dioxide (CO2) enters for photosynthesis.<br>
            <br>
            Stomata are also the main route for water loss by plants.
            Previous attempts to reduce water usage by manipulating
            these pores has generally come at a cost in CO2 uptake.<br>
            <br>
            Consequently, the plants engineered at Glasgow showed
            improved growth whilst conserving water use.<br>
            <br>
            The scientists’ modified plants grew as normal and
            substantially better under light conditions typical of the
            field, fixing more CO2 while losing less water to the
            atmosphere.<br>
            <br>
            Crop irrigation accounts for roughly 70% of fresh water use
            on the planet and its use has expanded at unsustainable
            rates over the past three decades. Scientists have been
            trying to find ways to make plants grow with less water.
            Until now, much of the research has reduced water
            consumption, but at a potential cost in reduced CO2 uptake
            and plant growth. This is not a satisfactory approach
            overall, given the growing demands on agricultural food
            production.<br>
            <br>
            This new research now offers a different approach that can
            successfully improve growth without compromising water use
            efficiency.<br>
            <br>
            The researchers studied the plant Arabidopsis, a member of
            the mustard family. Using the light-activated ion channel,
            called BLINK, the plant’s stomatal responses were
            accelerated and better synchronized when grown under
            fluctuating light – conditions which are typical of the
            natural environment (e.g. when clouds pass overhead or when
            shaded by neighboring plants). The engineered plants
            demonstrated improved growth and biomass production whilst
            also conserving water.<br>
            <br>
            Co-corresponding author Prof John Christie, from the
            University’s Institute of Molecular, Cell and Systems
            Biology, said: “Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of
            improving the efficiency of water use by plants while making
            gains in photosynthetic CO2 assimilation and plant growth.”<br>
            <br>
            Prof Mike Blatt added: “Previous efforts to improve plant
            water use efficiency have focused on reducing stomatal
            density, despite the implicit penalty in CO2 uptake for
            photosynthesis. Alternative approaches, like the one we have
            used, circumvent the carbon-water trade-off and could be
            used to improve crop yield, particularly under water
            limiting conditions.”<br>
            <br>
            Lead author Maria Papanatsiou said: “Plants must optimize
            the trade-off between photosynthesis and water loss to
            ensure plant growth and yield. We adopt a well-established
            approach used in neuroscience, called optogenetics, to
            better equip stomata that are essential in balancing CO2
            uptake and water loss.<br>
            <br>
            “We used a genetic tool that acts as a switch allowing
            stomata to better synchronize with light conditions and
            therefore enhance plant performance under light conditions
            often met in agricultural settings.”<br>

            improves carbon assimilation, water use, and growth’ is

            <b>Speeding up stomatal responses</b><br>
            A plant's cellular metabolism rapidly adjusts to changes in
            light conditions, but its stomata—pores that allow gas
            exchange in leaves—are slower to respond. Because of the
            lagging response, photosynthesis is less efficient, and
            excess water is lost through the open pores. Papanatsiou et
            al. introduced a blue light–responsive ion channel into
            stomata of the small mustard plant Arabidopsis. The channel
            increased the rate of stomata opening and closing in
            response to light. The engineered plants produced more
            biomass, especially in the fluctuating light conditions
            typical of outdoor growth.<br>

            ...Photosynthesis can be increased up to 400% by means of
            intermittent light. The researchers used a rotating disk
            with a cut-out section to chop the light from a lamp. They
            found that 75% of the light from a given source could be
            blocked without decreasing the rate of photosynthesis. The
            improved yields produced by intermittent light depends on
            the frequency of the flashing. A frequency of 4
            flashes/minute resulted in 100% increased yields. The amount
            of work done by the light can be increased by shortening
            both the light and dark periods. For example, yields can be
            increased 100% by using 133 flashes/second. Emerson and
            Williams improved the yield (compared to continuous light)
            by 400% by using only 50 flashes/second. The light flashes
            must be much shorter than the dark period. The minimum dark
            period is about 0.03 at 25o C. The light reaction begins
            with about 0.001 second/flash, and it depends on the
            concentration of carbon dioxide.<br>
            <br>
            A. Shakhov, et al., developed several methods of applying
            Concentrated Pulsed Sunlight (CPSL) to stimulate the
            photoenergetic activity of seeds and plants. The flashes of
            CPSL last from 0.2 to 1 second and produce significant
            effects on physiological processes and increase plant
            productivity. The CPSL effect is not caused by the thermal
            action of concentrated light, but by endowing plants with a
            "photoenergy reserve" that increases yields of vegetable
            crops by 20-30%, and grain crops by 5-10%.<br>
            <br>
            Arrays of aluminum and glass dishes are used to concentrate
            sunlight up to 100 times. The apparatus is shaken lightly by
            various means to pulse the irradiation as it is directed on
            seeds or plants. In one such device, a large semi-conical
            aluminum reflector is rotated by a motor at 100-130 rpm. The
            seeds arrange themselves in a single layer on the wall of

                in Zambales</b><br>

            <br>
            Microorganisms capable of “eating” plastic have been
            discovered in a hyperalkaline spring in Zambales, paving the
            way for research on new approaches to dealing with the
            country’s growing plastic problem.<br>
            <br>
            Researchers from the biology department of the University of
            the Philippines-Baguio have discovered four strains of
            bacteria that are capable of biodegrading low-density
            polyethylene (LDPE), which is commonly used for plastic
            bags, cling wrap, shampoo bottles and other containers.<br>
            <br>
            The study, written by Denisse Yans dela Torre, Lee delos
            Santos, Mari Louise Reyes and Ronan Baculi, was published in
            the Philippine Science Letters last year.<br>
            <br>
            It revealed that some bacterial strains collected from rock
            crevices of the Poon Bato spring in Botolan, Zambales are
            capable of degrading LDPE, which is highly resistant to
            degradation under natural conditions.<br>
            <br>
            The researchers said four of the nine bacteria that they
            isolated from the spring significantly reduced the weight of
            plastic polymer they were introduced to during the 90-day
            incubation period.<br>
            <br>
            After consuming the plastic, the bacteria produced
            byproducts that are environment friendly, according to the
            researchers.<br>
            <br>
            “Results revealed changes in physical structure and also
            chemical composition of the films. Another method which
            determined plastic utilization of the bacteria was the
            evident decrease in the weight of the films,” the office of
            the UP vice president for academic affairs said in a brief
            about the study.<br>
            <br>
            “Protein analysis also indicated that bacterial cells could
            live and proliferate with films as the source of energy.
            Looking at the physical and chemical changes of the plastics
            before and after some time with the bacterial isolates, it
            was deduced that these minute organisms can possibly end
            plastic domination by making a meal out of it,” it added.<br>
            <br>
            In their paper, the researchers said the LDPE degradation
            capability of the bacterial strains may be due to the
            extreme conditions, particularly the hyperalkaline
            environment, that they thrive in.<br>
            <br>
            They noted previous studies abroad that showed organisms
            thriving in extreme conditions as capable of biodegrading
            plastics.<br>
            <br>
            In the case of their study, the bacteria were found in Poon
            Bato Spring, a natural alkaline spring in Zambales that
            contains calcium, magnesium, sulfate, chloride and iron.<br>
            <br>
            With plastics emerging as a major environmental issue in the
            country and across the globe, the researchers said their
            discovery may be used in addressing the problem.<br>
            <br>
            Specifically, they pushed for continuing research to
            determine the distribution and population of
            polymer-degrading mi<br>
            <br>
            croorganisms and the possible formulation of a “microbial
            consortia” that would be more effective in biodegrading
            plastics.<br>
            <br>
            “This study demonstrated the ability of the isolates to
            degrade polyethylene even in the absence of prior oxidation
            treatments,” they wrote.<br>
            <br>
            “The results showed that selected microorganisms exhibited
            great potential for LDPE biodegradation, a discovery which
            can be used in reducing solid waste currently accumulating
            in natural environments,” they added.<br>

            <b>R. Gabriel Joseph, et al.</b></div>
          <b>Abstract</b><br>
          Evidence is reviewed which supports the hypothesis that
          prokaryotes and eukaryotes may have colonized Mars. One source
          of Martian life, is Earth. A variety of species remain viable
          after long term exposure to the radiation intense environment
          of space, and may survive ejection from Earth following meteor
          strikes, ejection from the stratosphere and mesosphere via
          solar winds, and sterilization of Mars-bound spacecraft;
          whereas simulations studies have shown that prokaryotes, fungi
          and lichens survive in simulated Martian environments --
          findings which support the hypothesis life may have been
          repeatedly transferred from Earth to Mars. Four independent
          investigators have reported what appears to be fungi and
          lichens on the Martian surface, whereas a fifth investigator
          reported what may be cyanobacteria. In another study, a
          statistically significant majority of 70 experts, after
          examining Martian specimens photographed by NASA, identified
          and agreed fungi, basidiomycota ("puffballs"), and lichens may
          have colonized Mars. Fifteen specimens resembling and
          identified as "puffballs" were photographed emerging from the
          ground over a three day period. It is possible these latter
          specimens are hematite and what appears to be "growth" is due
          to a strong wind which uncovered these specimens--an
          explanation which cannot account for before and after photos
          of what appears to be masses of fungi growing atop and within
          the Mars rovers. Terrestrial hematite is in part fashioned and
          cemented together by prokaryotes and fungi, and thus Martian
          hematite may also be evidence of biology. Three independent
          research teams have identified sediments on Mars resembling
          stromatolites and outcroppings having micro meso and macro
          characteristics typical of terrestrial microbialites
          constructed by cyanobacteria. Quantitative morphological
          analysis determined these latter specimens are statistically
          and physically similar to terrestrial stromatolites. Reports
          of water, biological residue discovered in Martian meteor
          ALH84001, the seasonal waning and waxing of atmospheric and
          ground level Martian methane which on Earth is 90% due to
          biology and plant growth and decay, and results from the 1976
          Mars Viking Labeled Release Experiments indicating biological
          activity, also support the hypothesis that Mars was, and is, a
          living planet. Nevertheless, much of the evidence remains
          circumstantial and unverified, and the possibility of life on
          Mars remains an open question.<br>

              Alzheimer’s symptoms</b><br>
            <i>Noninvasive treatment improves memory and reduces amyloid

          <br>
          By exposing mice to a unique combination of light and sound,
          MIT neuroscientists have shown that they can improve cognitive
          and memory impairments similar to those seen in Alzheimer’s
          patients.<br>
          <br>
          This noninvasive treatment, which works by inducing brain
          waves known as gamma oscillations, also greatly reduced the
          number of amyloid plaques found in the brains of these mice.
          Plaques were cleared in large swaths of the brain, including
          areas critical for cognitive functions such as learning and
          memory.<br>
          <br>
          “When we combine visual and auditory stimulation for a week,
          we see the engagement of the prefrontal cortex and a very
          dramatic reduction of amyloid,” says Li-Huei Tsai, director of
          MIT’s Picower Institute for Learning and Memory and the senior
          author of the study.<br>
          <br>
          Further study will be needed, she says, to determine if this
          type of treatment will work in human patients. The researchers
          have already performed some preliminary safety tests of this
          type of stimulation in healthy human subjects.<br>
          <br>
          MIT graduate student Anthony Martorell and Georgia Tech
          graduate student Abigail Paulson are the lead authors of the
          study, which appears in the March 14 issue of Cell.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Memory improvement</b><br>
          The brain’s neurons generate electrical signals that
          synchronize to form brain waves in several different frequency
          ranges. Previous studies have suggested that Alzheimer’s
          patients have impairments of their gamma-frequency
          oscillations, which range from 25 to 80 hertz (cycles per
          second) and are believed to contribute to brain functions such
          as attention, perception, and memory.<br>
          <br>
          In 2016, Tsai and her colleagues first reported the beneficial
          effects of restoring gamma oscillations in the brains of mice
          that are genetically predisposed to develop Alzheimer’s
          symptoms. In that study, the researchers used light flickering
          at 40 hertz, delivered for one hour a day. They found that
          this treatment reduced levels of beta amyloid plaques and
          another Alzheimer’s-related pathogenic marker, phosphorylated
          tau protein. The treatment also stimulated the activity of
          debris-clearing immune cells known as microglia.<br>
          <br>
          In that study, the improvements generated by flickering light
          were limited to the visual cortex. In their new study, the
          researchers set out to explore whether they could reach other
          brain regions, such as those needed for learning and memory,
          using sound stimuli. They found that exposure to one hour of
          40-hertz tones per day, for seven days, dramatically reduced
          the amount of beta amyloid in the auditory cortex (which
          processes sound) as well as the hippocampus, a key memory site
          that is located near the auditory cortex.<br>
          <br>
          “What we have demonstrated here is that we can use a totally
          different sensory modality to induce gamma oscillations in the
          brain. And secondly, this auditory-stimulation-induced gamma
          can reduce amyloid and Tau pathology in not just the sensory
          cortex but also in the hippocampus,” says Tsai, who is a
          founding member of MIT’s Aging Brain Initiative.<br>
          <br>
          The researchers also tested the effect of auditory stimulation
          on the mice’s cognitive abilities. They found that after one
          week of treatment, the mice performed much better when
          navigating a maze requiring them to remember key landmarks.
          They were also better able to recognize objects they had
          previously encountered.<br>
          <br>
          They also found that auditory treatment induced changes in not
          only microglia, but also the blood vessels, possibly
          facilitating the clearance of amyloid.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Dramatic effect</b><br>
          The researchers then decided to try combining the visual and
          auditory stimulation, and to their surprise, they found that
          this dual treatment had an even greater effect than either one
          alone. Amyloid plaques were reduced throughout a much greater
          portion of the brain, including the prefrontal cortex, where
          higher cognitive functions take place. The microglia response
          was also much stronger.<br>
          <br>
          “These microglia just pile on top of one another around the
          plaques,” Tsai says. “It’s very dramatic.”<br>
          <br>
          The researchers found that if they treated the mice for one
          week, then waited another week to perform the tests, many of
          the positive effects had faded, suggesting that the treatment
          would need to be given continually to maintain the benefits.<br>
          <br>
          In an ongoing study, the researchers are now analyzing how
          gamma oscillations affect specific brain cell types, in hopes
          of discovering the molecular mechanisms behind the phenomena
          they have observed. Tsai says she also hopes to explore why
          the specific frequency they use, 40 hertz, has such a profound
          impact.<br>
          <br>
          The combined visual and auditory treatment has already been
          tested in healthy volunteers, to assess its safety, and the
          researchers are now beginning to enroll patients with
          early-stage Alzheimer’s to study its possible effects on the
          disease.<br>
          <br>
          “Though there are important differences among species, there
          is reason to be optimistic that these methods can provide
          useful interventions for humans,” says Nancy Kopell, a
          professor of mathematics and statistics at Boston University,
          who was not involved in the research. “This paper and related
          studies have the potential for huge clinical impact in
          Alzheimer’s disease and others involving brain inflammation.”<br>
          <br>
          The research was funded, in part, by the Robert and Renee
          Belfer Family Foundation, the Halis Family Foundation, the JPB
          Foundation, the National Institutes of Health, and the MIT
          Aging Brain Initiative.<br>

          <b>Abstract</b><br>
          <b> </b>Low thermal conductivity is a primary limitation in
          the development of energy-efficient heat transfer fluids that
          are required in many industrial applications. In this paper we
          propose that an innovative new class of heat transfer fluids
          can be engineered by suspending metallic nanoparticles in
          conventional heat transfer fluids. The resulting
          {open_quotes}nanofluids{close_quotes} are expected to exhibit
          high thermal conductivities compared to those of currently
          used heat transfer fluids, and they represent the best hope
          for enhancement of heat transfer. The results of a theoretical
          study of the thermal conductivity of nanofluids with copper
          nanophase materials are presented, the potential benefits of
          the fluids are estimated, and it is shown that one of the
          benefits of nanofluids will be dramatic reductions in heat
          exchanger pumping power.<br>

            <b>by Raymond Ibrahim</b><br>
          </div>
          <br>
          Exactly 233 years ago this week, two of America’s founding
          fathers documented their first exposure to Islamic jihad in a
          letter to Congress; like many Americans today, they too were
          shocked at what they learned. <br>
          <br>
          Context: in 1785, Muslim pirates from North Africa, or
          “Barbary,” had captured two American ships, the Maria and
          Dauphin, and enslaved their crews. In an effort to ransom the
          enslaved Americans and establish peaceful relations, Thomas
          Jefferson and John Adams -- then ambassadors to France and
          England respectively -- met with Tripoli’s ambassador to
          Britain, Abdul Rahman Adja. Following this diplomatic
          exchange, they laid out the source of the Barbary States’
          hitherto inexplicable animosity to American vessels in a
          letter to Congress dated March 28, 1786:<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We took the liberty to make some inquiries
          concerning the grounds of their [Barbary’s] pretentions to
          make war upon nations who had done them no injury, and
          observed that we considered all mankind as our friends who had
          done us no wrong, nor had given us any provocation. The
          ambassador answered us that it was founded on the laws of
          their Prophet, that it was written in their Koran, that all
          nations who should not have acknowledged their authority were
          sinners, that it was their right and duty to make war upon
          them wherever they could be found, and to make slaves of all
          they could take as prisoners, and that every Musselman who
          should be slain in battle was sure to go to Paradise<br>
          <br>
          One need not conjecture what the American ambassadors -- who
          years earlier had asserted that all men were “endowed by their
          Creator with certain inalienable rights” -- thought of their
          Muslim counterpart’s answer.&nbsp; Suffice to say, because the
          ransom demanded was over fifteen times greater than what
          Congress had approved, little came of the meeting.<br>
          <br>
          It should be noted that centuries before setting their sights
          on American vessels, the Barbary States of Muslim North Africa
          -- specifically Tripoli, Algiers, Tunis -- had been thriving
          on the slave trade of Christians abducted from virtually every
          corner of coastal Europe -- including Britain, Ireland,
          Denmark, and Iceland.&nbsp; These raids were so successful
          that, “between 1530 and 1780 there were almost certainly a
          million and quite possibly as many as a million and a quarter
          white, European Christians enslaved by the Muslims of the
          Barbary Coast,” to quote American historian Robert Davis.<br>
          <br>
          The treatment of these European slaves was exacerbated by the
          fact that they were Christian “infidels.”&nbsp; As Robert
          Playfair (b.1828), who served for years as a consul in
          Barbary, explained, “In almost every case they [European
          slaves] were hated on account of their religion.”&nbsp; Three
          centuries earlier, John Foxe had written in his Book of
          Martyrs that, “In no part of the globe are Christians so
          hated, or treated with such severity, as at Algiers.”<br>
          <br>
          The punishments these European slaves received for real or
          imagined offenses beggared description: “If they speak against
          Mahomet [blasphemy], they must become Mahometans, or be
          impaled alive. If they profess Christianity again, after
          having changed to the Mahometan persuasion, they are roasted
          alive [as apostates], or thrown from the city walls, and
          caught upon large sharp hooks, on which they hang till they
          expire.”<br>
          <br>
          As such, when Captain O’Brien of the Dauphin wrote to
          Jefferson saying that “our sufferings are beyond our
          expression or your conception,” he was clearly not
          exaggerating.<br>
          <br>
          After Barbary’s ability to abduct coastal Europeans had waned
          in the mid-eighteenth century, its energy was spent on raiding
          infidel merchant vessels. Instead of responding by
          collectively confronting and neutralizing Barbary, European
          powers, always busy quarrelling among themselves, opted to buy
          peace through tribute (or, according to Muslim rationale,
          jizya). <br>
          <br>
          Fresh meat appeared on the horizon once the newly-born United
          States broke free of Great Britain (and was therefore no
          longer protected by the latter’s jizya payments).<br>
          <br>
          Some American congressmen agreed with Jefferson that “it will
          be more easy to raise ships and men to fight these pirates
          into reason, than money to bribe them” -- including General
          George Washington: “In such an enlightened, in such a liberal
          age, how is it possible that the great maritime powers of
          Europe should submit to pay an annual tribute to the little
          piratical States of Barbary?” he wrote to a friend. “Would to
          Heaven we had a navy able to reform those enemies to mankind,
          or crush them into nonexistence.”&nbsp; <br>
          <br>
          But the majority of Congress agreed with John Adams: “We ought
          not to fight them at all unless we determine to fight them
          forever.” Considering the perpetual, existential nature of
          Islamic hostility, Adams may have been more right than he
          knew.<br>
          <br>
          Congress settled on emulating the Europeans and paying off the
          terrorists, though it would take years to raise the demanded
          ransom.<br>
          <br>
          When Muslim pirates from Algiers captured eleven more American
          merchant vessels in 1794, the Naval Act was passed and a
          permanent U.S. naval force established. But because the first
          war vessels would not be ready until 1800, American jizya
          payments -- which took up 16 percent of the federal budget --
          began to be made to Algeria in 1795. In return, over 100
          American sailors were released -- how many died or disappeared
          is unclear -- and the Islamic sea raids formally ceased.
          American payments and “gifts” over the following years caused
          the increasingly emboldened Muslim pirates to respond with
          increasingly capricious demands.<br>
          <br>
          One of the more ignoble instances occurred in 1800, when
          Captain William Bainbridge of the George Washington sailed to
          the pirate-leader of Algiers, with what the latter deemed
          insufficient tribute. Referring to the Americans as “my
          slaves,” Dey Mustapha ordered them to transport hundreds of
          black slaves to Istanbul (Constantinople).&nbsp; Adding insult
          to insult, he commanded the American crew to take down the
          U.S. flag and hoist the Islamic flag -- one not unlike ISIS’
          notorious black flag -- in its place.&nbsp; And, no matter how
          rough the seas might be during the long voyage, Bainbridge was
          required to make sure the George Washington faced Mecca five
          times a day to accommodate the prayers of Muslims onboard.<br>
          <br>
          That Bainbridge condescended to becoming Barbary’s delivery
          boy seems only to have further whetted the terrorists’
          appetite.&nbsp; In 1801, Tripoli demanded an instant payment
          of $225,000, followed by annual payments of $25,000 --
          respectively equivalent to $3.5 million and $425,000
          today.&nbsp; Concluding that “nothing will stop the eternal
          increase of demand from these pirates but the presence of an
          armed force,” America’s third president, Jefferson, refused
          the ultimatum. (He may have recalled Captain O’Brien’s
          observation concerning his Barbary masters: “Money is their
          God and Mahomet their prophet.”)<br>
          <br>
          Denied jizya from the infidels, Tripoli proclaimed jihad on
          the United States on May 10, 1801. But by now, America had six
          war vessels, which Jefferson deployed to the Barbary
          Coast.&nbsp; For the next five years, the U.S. Navy warred
          with the Muslim pirates, making little headway and suffering
          some setbacks -- the most humiliating being when the
          Philadelphia and its crew were captured in 1803.<br>

          Desperate measures were needed: enter William Eaton. As U.S.
          consul to Tunis (1797–1803), he had lived among and understood
          the region’s Muslims well. He knew that “the more you give the
          more the Turks will ask for,” and despised that old sense of
          Islamic superiority: “It grates me mortally,” he wrote, “when
          I see a lazy Turk [generic for Muslim] reclining at his ease
          upon an embroidered sofa, with one Christian slave to hold his
          pipe, another to hold his coffee, and a third to fan away the
          flies.” Seeing that the newborn American navy was making
          little headway against the seasoned pirates, he devised a
          daring plan: to sponsor the claim of Mustafa’s brother, exiled
          in Alexandria; and then to march the latter’s supporters and
          mercenaries through five hundred miles of desert, from
          Alexandria onto Tripoli.<br>
          <br>
          The trek was arduous -- not least because of the Muslim
          mercenaries themselves. Eaton had repeatedly tried to win them
          over: “I touched upon the affinity of principle between the
          Islam and Americans [sic] religion.” But despite these all too
          familiar ecumenical overtures, “We find it almost impossible
          to inspire these wild bigots with confidence in us,” he
          lamented in his diary, “or to persuade them that, being
          Christians, we can be otherwise than enemies to Mussulmen. We
          have a difficult undertaking!” (For all his experience with
          Muslims, Eaton was apparently unaware of the finer points of
          their (Sharia) law, namely, al-wala’ wa’l bara’, or “loyalty
          and enmity.”)<br>
          <br>
          Eaton eventually managed to reach and conquer Tripoli’s
          coastal town of Derne on April 27, 1805.&nbsp; Less than two
          months later, on June 10, a peace treaty was signed between
          the U.S. and Tripoli, formally ending hostilities.<br>
          <br>
          Thus and despite the (rather ignorant) question that became
          popular after 9/11, “Why do they hate us?” -- a question that
          was answered to Jefferson and Adams 233 years ago today -- the
          United States’ first war and victory as a nation was against
          Muslims, and the latter had initiated hostilities on the same
          rationale Muslims had used to initiate hostilities against
          non-Muslims for the preceding 1,200 years.<br>
