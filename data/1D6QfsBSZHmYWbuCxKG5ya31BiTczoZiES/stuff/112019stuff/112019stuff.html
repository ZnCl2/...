              More Evidence of a New Force of Nature</b><br>

          </b>...Attila Krasznahorkay and his colleagues from the
          Institute for Nuclear Research in Hungary suspected something
          weird was going on back in 2016, after analysing the way an
          excited beryllium-8 emits light as it decays.<br>
          <br>
          If that light is energetic enough, it transforms into an
          electron and a positron, which push away from one another at a
          predictable angle before zooming off.<br>
          Based on the law of conservation of energy, as the energy of
          the light producing the two particles increases, the angle
          between them should decrease. Statistically speaking, at
          least.<br>
          <br>
          Oddly, this isn't quite what Krasznahorkay and his team saw.
          Among their tally of angles there was an unexpected rise in
          the number of electrons and positrons separating at an angle
          of 140 degrees.<br>
          <br>
          The study seemed robust enough, and soon attracted the
          attention of other researchers around the globe who suggested
          that a whole new particle could be responsible for the
          anomaly.<br>
          <br>
          Not just any old particle; its characteristics suggested it
          had to be a completely new kind of fundamental boson.<br>
          <br>
          That's no small claim. We currently know of four fundamental
          forces, and we know that three of them have bosons carrying
          their messages of attraction and repulsion.<br>
          <br>
          The force of gravity is carried by a hypothetical particle
          known as a 'graviton', but sadly scientists have not yet
          detected it.<br>
          <br>
          This new boson couldn't possibly be one of the particles
          carrying the four known forces, thanks to its distinctive mass
          of (17 megaelectronvolts, or about 33 times that of an
          electron), and tiny life span (of about 10 to the minus 14
          seconds … <br>
          <br>
          But if this strange boson isn't just an illusion caused by
          some experimental blip, the fact it interacts with neutrons
          hints at a force that acts nothing like the traditional four.<br>
          <br>
          With the ghostly pull of dark matter posing one of the biggest
          mysteries in physics today, a completely new fundamental
          particle could point to a solution we're all craving,
          providing a way to connect the matter we can see with the
          matter we can't.<br>
          <br>
          In fact, a number of dark matter experiments have been keeping
          an eye out for a 17 megavolt oddball particle. So far they've
          found nothing, but with plenty of room left to explore, it's
          too early to rule anything out...<br>

          electro-magnetically forbidden M0 transition depopulating the
          21.01 MeV 0&#8722; state in 4He. A peak was observed in their e+e&#8722;
          angular correlations at 115&#8728; with 7.2&#963; significance, and could
          be described by assuming the creation and subsequent decay of

              happening to about two-thirds of the world's grasslands,
              accelerating climate change and causing traditional
              grazing societies to descend into social chaos. Savory has
              devoted his life to stopping it. He now believes, and his
              work so far shows, that a surprising factor can protect
              grasslands and even reclaim degraded land that was once
              desert. The role of livestock in a new agriculture that
              can save city-based civilization. Allan discusses how
              animals, such as sheep, can be used to heal landscapes,
              combat climate change, restore economies, increase soil
              fertility, produce clean water, provide healthy habitat

              The foreshock, extending upstream of Earth's bow shock, is
              a region of intense electromagnetic wave activity and
              nonlinear phenomena, which can have global effects on
              geospace. It is also the first geophysical region
              encountered by solar wind disturbances journeying toward
              Earth. Here, we present the first observations of
              considerable modifications of the foreshock wave field
              during extreme events of solar origin called magnetic
              clouds. Cluster's multispacecraft data reveal that the
              typical quasi&#8208;monochromatic foreshock waves can be
              completely replaced by a superposition of waves each with
              shorter correlation lengths. Global numerical simulations
              further confirm that the foreshock wave field is more
              intricate and organized at smaller scales. Ion
              measurements suggest that changes in shock&#8208;reflected
              particle properties may cause these modifications of the
              wave field. This state of the foreshock is encountered
              only during extreme events at Earth, but intense magnetic
              fields are typical close to the Sun or other stars.</font><b><font

                Plain Language Summary<br>
              </font></b><font color="#000000">Solar storms are giant
              clouds of particles ejected from the Sun into space during
              solar eruptions. When solar storms are directed toward
              Earth, they can cause large disturbances in near&#8208;Earth
              space, for example, disrupting communications or damaging
              spacecraft electronics. Understanding in detail what
              happens when solar storms reach Earth is crucial to
              mitigate their effects. Using measurements from the
              Cluster spacecraft, we investigate how solar storms modify
              the properties of the very first region of near&#8208;Earth
              space they encounter when journeying toward Earth. This
              region, called the foreshock, extends ahead of the
              protective bubble formed by the Earth's magnetic field,
              the magnetosphere. The foreshock is home to intense
              electromagnetic waves, and disturbances in this region can
              perturb the Earth's magnetosphere. Our study reveals that
              solar storms modify profoundly the foreshock, resulting in
              a more complex wave activity. Global numerical simulations
              performed with the Vlasiator code confirm our findings.
              These changes could affect the regions of space closer to
              Earth, for example, in modifying the wave properties or
              the amount of solar particles entering the Earth's
              magnetosphere. This needs to be taken into account to
              better anticipate the effects of solar storms at Earth.</font><b><font

              Agency’s Cluster mission has captured a recording of the
              eerie ‘song’ Earth sings when it is hit by a solar storm.
              <br>
              <br>
              The song comes from waves that are generated in the
              Earth’s magnetic field by the collision of the storm. The
              storm itself is the eruption of electrically charged
              particles from the Sun’s atmosphere.<br>
              <br>
              These audio clips contain a ‘sonification’ of the magnetic
              waves generated in the magnetic foreshock above Earth –
              the first region of our planet’s magnetic environment that
              solar wind particles encounter. The first clip was
              recorded during calm space weather conditions, and the
              second during a solar storm. The sounds were obtained by
              transforming the frequencies of these magnetic waves into
              audible sound waves. The eerie sounds heard during a solar
              storm are higher in pitch and more complicated than those
              heard during calm conditions.<br>

              No, this is NOT satire!<br>
              <br>
              During an interview with NPR affiliate WSIU-FM, Cooper
              claimed that black people have a reputation for being
              late, therefore time itself is “owned” by white people.<br>
              <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Typically, we talk about race in terms
              of black and white issues. In the African-American
              communities from which I come, we have a long-standing
              multigenerational joke about what we call CP time or
              colored people time. Now, we no longer refer to
              African-Americans as colored. But this long-standing joke
              about our perpetual lateness to church, to cookouts, to
              family events and even to our own funerals remains. I
              personally am a stickler for time. It’s almost as if my
              mother, when I was growing up, said, we will not be those
              black people. So we typically arrive to events 30 minutes
              early. But today I want to talk to you more about the
              political nature of time; for if time had a race, it would
              be white. White people own time."<br>

              Night falls in Bolivia as tensions increase<br>
              <br>
              A series of audio and video recordings has revealed the
              plan to hit the state of Bolivia against President
              Morales.<br>
              <br>
              These recordings reveal the participation of agents from
              The United States, including Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio and Bob
              Menendez who held meetings with those who overthrew
              Morales before the hit occurred.<br>
              <br>
              These recordings revealed that the action against Morales
              was a bi partisan effort by the United States, involving
              both Democrats and Republicans.<br>
              <br>
              They cooperated to steal elections and create violent
              uprisings against Morales, and will continue until the
              entire Bolivian government is overthrown. The houses where
              the government officials live have been marked for direct
              attacks with a small painted X in the color that
              represents their position in government with a specific
              preference to people who watch over the elections, so they
              can be eliminated and new people put in their place.<br>
              <br>
              An additional effort will be made to nullify past election
              results.<br>
              <br>
              There are many many audio and video recordings that
              demonstrate the ways and ways they plan to hit the state
              and repress the people and turn back the efforts of the
              elected president Evo Morales<br>

              Will The Economic Collapse Happen In 2020?</font><font
              color="#000000"><br>
              <br>
              Even though most Americans have become very frustrated
              with this economy, the reality is that the vast majority
              of them still have no idea just how bad our economic
              decline has been or how much trouble we are going to be in
              if we don’t make dramatic changes immediately.&nbsp; If we
              do not educate the American people about how deathly ill
              the U.S. economy has become, then they will just keep
              falling for the same old lies that our politicians keep
              telling them.&nbsp; Just “tweaking” things here and there
              is not going to fix this economy.&nbsp; We truly do need a
              fundamental change in direction.&nbsp; America is
              consuming far more wealth than it is producing and our
              debt is absolutely exploding.&nbsp; If we stay on this
              current path, an economic collapse is inevitable.&nbsp;
              Hopefully the crazy economic numbers from 2019 that I have
              included in this video will be shocking enough to wake
              some people up.<br>
              <br>
              And as you will see in this video, the latest signs are
              clearly telling us that the U.S. economy is heading for a
              major stock market crash and financial collapse. Hopefully
              many of you will use the list below as a tool to help you
              share the reality of the U.S. economic crisis with your
              family and friends.&nbsp; If we all work together,
              hopefully we can get millions of people to wake up and
              realize that “business as usual” will result in a national
              economic meltdown. As I have explained repeatedly, stock
              prices would need to crash by 40 or 50 percent just to get
              key valuation ratios back to their long-term averages. <br>
              <br>
              After all of these years of publishing videos about the
              coming stock market crash and economic crisis, nothing has
              changed as far as the long-term outlook is concerned. We
              are still heading toward a complete and total economic
              meltdown. Just because the economic collapse is not going
              to happen this month does not mean that it is not going to
              happen.&nbsp; When you step back and take a broader view
              of what is happening, it becomes exceedingly clear where
              we are heading. Sadly, most Americans will never do that.

              pavement</b><br>

          <b> </b><br>
          It is a pavement made of tires, which is regenerated by
          absorbing water, thus solving the largest deficit in Mexico.<br>
          <br>
          <b>What it does</b><b><br>
          </b>Damage is caused by rain filtering to the base of
          pavements, weakening it and creating subsidence. This is how
          the idea that turning the greatest degradation agent into a
          recovery agent was born.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Your inspiration</b><b><br>
          </b>I was inspired to solve the problem that every time it
          rains in my city pavement gets damaged and it takes a lot of
          time to maintain a damaged street. I am determined to create a
          pavement capable of withstanding the rain.<br>
          <br>
          <b>How it works</b><b><br>
          </b>The pavement was inspired by concrete that regenerates
          with bacteria, transferring its chemical functionalities to
          the pavement without the use of bacteria. Everything is born
          from the additives used because there is homogenization with
          the material and the rubber when they are at high temperature
          but following the same process of manufacture of the asphalt
          pavement. The regeneration is due to a putty that is created
          when rubber and additives are mixed, this putty is in contact
          with the water creates calcium silicates which is one of the
          components of the regeneration and physical-chemical
          improvement of the pavement<br>
          <br>
          <b>Design process</b><br>
          This invention is the reformulation of my original project,
          since I first considered asphalt and other additives but when
          I observed the possibility of using rubber tires that
          contaminate our cities I determined to improve my project.
          Following the Aashto standards to perform indirect tensile
          tests and the Marshall test, design specimens to experiment
          and after passing to the press and be broken they were
          submitted to the water to verify their recovery and again the
          specimens returned to the press to determine the percentage of
          recovery.<br>
          How it is different<br>
          <br>
          At present there are already pavements that regenerate but
          none uses water as a means of regeneration and much less made
          of tires, while in Mexico 80% of the pavement is asphalt and
          20% concrete hydraulic is continued with this monotony of poor
          use for the most important infrastructure that connects us
          all.<br>
          Future plans<br>
          <br>
          The main thing is the certification of ONNCCE (they are in
          charge of endorsing products for buildings in Mexico) then it
          will be to take a technical sheet of my invention to the
          communications and transportation secretary (SCT) since they
          are the ones that determine which asphalt will be used In the
          constructions and in the medium term I would like to start my
          own construction company to be able to implement my invention<br>

          </div>
          <br>
          Rubber pavement that regenerates with rainwater is the
          national winner of the James Dyson Award, an international
          award that challenges students and recent graduates to design
          something that solves a problem.<br>
          <br>
          Created by Israel Antonio Briseño Carmona, a student at the
          Coahuila Autonomous University in Torreón, the
          self-regenerating pavement is made out of discarded tires.<br>
          <br>
          Regeneration of the pavement occurs through the absorption of
          rainwater, a process that prevents road damage such as
          potholes.<br>
          <br>
          Briseño said that his inspiration for the idea was a question:
          why do potholes appear every time it rains?<br>
          <br>
          “What happens is that when it rains, water filters down to the
          sub-base creating a fault and when a car goes over it, it
          collapses. That’s why I wanted to turn the main agent of
          deterioration [asphalt or concrete] into an agent of recovery
          [rubber]. With my project, water would be a [source of]
          maintenance for our roads,” he explained.<br>
          <br>
          Briseño obtained a patent for his unique idea in April under
          the name Paflec. It has not yet been used to build a road but
          Briseño hopes that will change soon.<br>
          <br>
          He explained that he has a three-phase plan to make his
          road-building idea a reality.<br>
          <br>
          The first phase involves meeting with an engineer to “resolve
          doubts” about the project and then building a short section of
          road to ensure that it functions as envisaged. The second
          phase is to certify the construction system with the national
          building certification organization ONNCCE and the third phase
          is to gain approval from the Secretariat of Communications and
          Transportation.<br>
          <br>
          “In the medium term, I would like to start my own construction
          company to be able to implement my invention,” Briseño said...<br>

          <div align="center"><b>Dutch professor develops simple trick
              to make roads “self-healing”</b><br>
            <b>By David Rogers</b><br>
          </div>
          <br>
          A professor at Delft University of Technology has come up with
          a way to make roads heal themselves – with a little help from
          microwaves.<br>
          <br>
          Erik Schlangen is proposing to mix asphalt with tiny fragments
          of steel wool, of the kind used to scour pans. The purpose of
          the steel is not to reinforce the asphalt, but to heat up when
          subject to microwave radiation.<br>
          <br>
          Most roads in the Netherlands are constructed using porous
          asphalt. The spaces in the pavement structure help to absorb
          sound and water, making Dutch roads dryer and quieter than
          those built with more solid bitumen.<br>
          <br>
          However, the gaps also make the structure more vulnerable to
          erosion and weathering. This leads to the formation of
          microscopic cracks in the bitumen that holds the aggregate
          together. The result is progressive “ravelling”, and
          eventually the formation of potholes and loose stones that can
          damage vehicles using the road.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Putting steel fibres in the asphalt means
          that you can send information to it, so it might be possible
          to charge electric cars on the road they’re driving on"<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; – Erik Schlangen<br>
          <br>
          Schlangen’s idea is to add steel so that the road is easier to
          heat by induction. When it is heated, the asphalt melts and
          the microscopic cracks are filled in and hold the aggregate in
          place.<br>
          <br>
          The Dutch government donated a 400m stretch of the A58 as a
          test bed for Schlangen’s concept. Research conducted on
          samples from that pavement have suggested that the life of a
          road can be doubled if it is melted once every four years...<br>

          In human trials, the virus will be directly injected into the
          tumors in hopes that it will multiply and kill it. <br>
          <br>
          A new cowpox-style virus has been created by scientists that

          Called CF33, the virus was developed by Australian company

          </b><b>Islam Is Not Compatible With Civilized Society</b><b><br>
          </b><b>By Roger Anghis</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          One of the most ridiculous things I see in the form of a
          bumper sticker is the one using religious symbols spelling out
          Coexist.&nbsp; I don’t know why but I don’t think I’ve ever
          seen a man driving a car with that sticker.&nbsp; I’m not
          trying to be sexist, just truthful.&nbsp; It is obvious that
          the people that have that sticker don’t have the ability to
          think for themselves.&nbsp; I’m not being rude, I’m pointing
          out the obvious.<br>
          <br>
          If one takes the time to even lightly research the history of
          islam, they would scrape that sticker off of their car because
          there is no historical evidence that islam can co-exist with
          other religions.&nbsp; The only time they do is when there are
          so few islamists that they have no ability to be the force
          they want to be.<br>
          <br>
          People say that they are ‘co-existing’ in America now so they
          can co-exist.&nbsp; Looking at the statistics they are one of
          the smallest minorities in America.&nbsp; Recent political
          debates over Muslim immigration and related issues have
          prompted many people to ask how many Muslims actually live in
          the United States. But coming up with an answer is not easy,
          in part because the U.S. Census Bureau does not ask questions
          about religion, meaning there is no official government count
          of the U.S. Muslim population.<br>
          <br>
          Still, based on our own survey and demographic research, as
          well as outside sources, Pew Research Center estimates that
          there were about 3.45 million Muslims of all ages living in
          the U.S. in 2017, and that Muslims made up about 1.1% of the
          total U.S. population. [1] Even though they are a very small
          minority it hasn’t stopped them from flexing their muscle
          here.&nbsp; Keep in mind that muslims immigrate for only one
          reason and that is to begin the take over of the government
          where they immigrate.&nbsp; A document was found in Falls
          Church, Virginia in 2004 that explains, in part, their overall
          plan: The following is the official document from a 1991
          meeting which outlines the Muslim Brotherhood’s strategic
          goals for North America. The document was entered as evidence
          in the 2008 Holy Land Terror Funding Trial. Federal
          investigators found the document in the home of Ismael
          Elbarasse, a founder of the Dar Al-Hijrah mosque in Falls
          Church, Virginia, during a 2004 search. Elbarasse was a member
          of the Palestine Committee, which the Muslim Brotherhood had
          created to support Hamas in the United States.<br>

          Page 7:<br>
          <br>
          “The process of settlement is a ‘Civilization-Jihadist
          Process’ with all the word means. The Ikhwan [Muslim
          Brotherhood] must understand that their work in America is a
          kind of grand jihad in eliminating and destroying the Western
          civilization from within and ‘sabotaging’ its miserable house
          by their hands and the hands of the believers…”<br>
          <br>
          “[W]e must possess a mastery of the art of ‘coalitions’, the
          art of ‘absorption’ and the principles of ‘cooperation.’”<br>
          <br>
          Page 18:<br>
          <br>
          “A list of our organizations and the organizations of our
          friends” – This is where the Muslim Brotherhood listed its
          front groups in the U.S.. Note that prominent organizations
          like CAIR, ISNA, ICNA, and others are named here. [2]<br>
          <br>
          If we don’t stay awake and pay attention to what is going on
          we will lose this great experiment called America.&nbsp; I am
          ashamed to say that my generation, the baby boomers, are the
          ones that let this get way too out of hand.&nbsp; We have not
          paid attention to who we put in office, the laws that they
          passed and have allowed this nation to go in a direction that
          our Founders would find appalling.<br>
          <br>
          For those that think that muslims don’t have the take over of
          America in mind need to hear the words of the founder of CAIR
          Omar Ahmad: According to a local newspaper report, Omar Ahmad,
          a founder of CAIR, told a conference hall packed with
          California Muslims in July 1998 that Islam isn’t in America to
          be equal to any other faith, but to become dominant.<br>
          <br>
          The reporter paraphrased Ahmad saying, “The Quran … should be
          the highest authority in America, and Islam the only accepted
          religion on earth.” [3] This is the comments of an
          organization that has a goal.&nbsp; They have denied that Omar
          made this comment but the reporter and the paper stand by
          their story.<br>
          <br>
          When looking at the principles of islam there is no one that
          is sane that can state that this ideology, I cannot call it a
          religion, is in any way compatible with any civilized
          society.&nbsp; They have never assimilated into any society
          that they have migrated to.&nbsp; Once they reach a certain
          percentage of the population, they begin to assert their
          influence wherever they can.&nbsp; They are to a point in
          America with just the 1.1% that they have begun to make
          certain statements concerning their supposed superiority over
          other religions and peoples.&nbsp; CAIR leader Mustafaa
          Carroll said that Muslims are above the law of the land and
          Sharia law supersedes the U.S. constitution. [4] He is telling
          those that follow that ideology that the laws of the land do
          not pertain to them because they are governed by shariah which
          in their opinion is above any law anywhere.&nbsp; They deny
          this saying that are to obey the laws but they also ignore
          them and follow their so-called holy book.<br>
          <br>
          The imams, muslim ‘spiritual’ leaders,&nbsp; in America preach

          ...Even when the cathode is heated for 10 hours, the structure
          of the cathode surface remains almost unchanged (Fig.
          4b).&nbsp; However, if the cathode is heated for only 1 hour
          with simultaneous action of torsion radiation at a frequency
          of 0.1 MHz generated by a torsion generator (8) (Fig. 4d),
          then the cathode emission pattern changes dramatically (Fig.
          4c). Under the action of a torsion field, two brightly
          emitting areas appear on the cathode (two spots in Fig. 4c) in
          the &lt;001&gt; direction....<br>

          Many view over-the-counter (OTC) drugs as safe because they
          don’t require a prescription. Nothing could be further from
          the truth. Acetaminophen, for example, (also known as
          paracetamol and sold under the brand name Tylenol among
          others) is actually one of the more dangerous drugs you can
          get your hands on.<br>
          <br>
          Despite statistics showing acetaminophen is the leading cause
          of acute liver failure in the U.S.,1 most people don’t think
          twice before downing those pills. Acetaminophen is also found
          in a wide variety of products designed to treat headache,
          fever and cold symptoms, as well as in prescription pain
          medications mixed with codeine or hydrocodone.2 And, most
          households have more than one of the over-the-counter
          products, which could easily lead to overdosing.<br>
          <br>
          Although it was initially hailed as a safe drug for pain, by
          2013 lawsuits were piling up, citing 50,000 trips to the
          emergency room every year, all due to Tylenol causing liver
          and kidney failure.3 The grim truth is that as early as 2005
          scientists already knew that “severe acetaminophen
          hepatotoxicity leads to acute liver failure.”4<br>
          <br>
          Not only that, reports also showed that unintentional
          overdoses accounted for hundreds of suicide attempts, deaths
          and liver transplants. Along that line, statistics from
          national database analyses in 20065 showed that acetaminophen
          accounted for an estimated 56,000 emergency room visits and
          26,000 hospitalizations annually. The average annual death
          toll from acetaminophen overdose was 458.<br>
          <br>
          A number of studies have also linked acetaminophen use during
          pregnancy with lifelong repercussions for the child, raising
          their risk of developing conduct disorders, hyperactivity and
          autism.<br>
          Acetaminophen Use Linked to Hyperactivity in Offspring<br>
          <br>
          In 2014, a study in the journal JAMA Pediatrics6 revealed that
          “Research data suggest that acetaminophen is a hormone
          disruptor, and abnormal hormonal exposures in pregnancy may
          influence fetal brain development.” This is a significant
          concern, considering many pregnant women are likely to reach
          for an OTC pain reliever at some point during their pregnancy.<br>
          <br>
          According to that 2014 study, use of acetaminophen during
          pregnancy was associated with a 37% increased risk of their
          child being diagnosed with hyperkinetic disorder, a severe
          form of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).<br>
          <br>
          Their children were also 29% more likely to be prescribed ADHD
          medication by the time they were 7 years old. The strongest
          associations were observed in mothers who used acetaminophen
          in more than a single trimester, and the greater the frequency
          of use, the more likely their child was to experience
          behavioral problems. As reported by Forbes at the time:7<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Acetaminophen can cross the placenta,
          making its way to the fetus and its delicate developing
          nervous system. The drug is a known endocrine (hormone)
          disrupter, and has previously been linked to undescended
          testes in male infants.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the maternal hormone environment
          plays a critical role in the development of the fetus, the
          authors say that it’s ‘possible that acetaminophen may
          interrupt brain development by interfering with maternal
          hormones or via neurotoxicity such as the induction of
          oxidative stress that can cause neuronal death.’”<br>
          <br>
          Similar findings were published in 2016. This study,8 also
          published in JAMA Pediatrics, found use of acetaminophen at 18
          and 32 weeks of pregnancy was associated with a 42% higher
          risk of conduct problems and a 31% higher risk of
          hyperactivity symptoms in the child.<br>
          <br>
          When the mother used acetaminophen at 32 weeks of pregnancy,
          the child also had a 29% higher risk of having emotional
          problems and a 46% higher risk of “total difficulties.”<br>
          <br>
          <b>Tylenol in Pregnancy May Double or Triple Risk of Autism</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          A study9,10,11 published online October 30, 2019, in JAMA
          Psychiatry further strengthens the link between acetaminophen
          use and ADHD, while also noting an increased risk for autism
          spectrum disorder (ASD). According to the authors:12<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Prior studies have raised concern about
          maternal acetaminophen use during pregnancy and increased risk
          of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism
          spectrum disorder (ASD) in their children; however, most
          studies have relied on maternal self-report …<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this cohort study of 996 mother-infant
          dyads from the Boston Birth Cohort, cord plasma biomarkers of
          fetal exposure to acetaminophen were associated with
          significantly increased risk of childhood
          attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and autism spectrum
          disorder.”<br>
          <br>
          Compared to children of mothers with the lowest acetaminophen
          burden (first tertile, based on cord plasma biomarkers for
          acetaminophen), children of those in the second tertile had a
          226% higher risk of being diagnosed with ADHD, and a 214%
          higher risk for an ASD diagnosis by the time they were about
          10 years old (average age 9.8 years).<br>
          <br>
          Those with the greatest (third tertile) acetaminophen burden
          had a 286% higher risk for ADHD and a 362% higher risk for
          ASD. As noted by the authors,13 their findings “support
          previous studies regarding the association between prenatal
          and perinatal acetaminophen exposure and childhood
          neurodevelopmental risk.”<br>
          <br>
          <b>More Evidence Against Taking Acetaminophen During Pregnancy</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          In addition to the studies already mentioned, a number of
          others have also documented this disturbing link between
          acetaminophen use during pregnancy and neurological problems
          in the children. Among them:<br>
          <br>
          •A 2013 study14 published in the International Journal of
          Epidemiology found “children exposed to [acetaminophen] for
          more than 28 days during pregnancy had poorer gross motor
          development, communication, externalizing behavior,
          internalizing behavior and higher activity levels” than
          unexposed children at age 3. Use of ibuprofen was not
          associated with these neurodevelopmental effects.<br>
          <br>
          •A 2016 Spanish investigation15,16 published in the
          International Journal of Epidemiology found children of both
          sexes whose mothers used acetaminophen during pregnancy were
          41% more likely to present with ADHD symptoms at age 5. Boys
          were also more likely to have ASD. As noted by the authors:<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Prenatal acetaminophen exposure was
          associated with a greater number of autism spectrum symptoms
          in males and showed adverse effects on attention-related
          outcomes for both genders. These associations seem to be
          dependent on the frequency of exposure.”<br>
          <br>
          Aside from a higher risk of neurodevelopmental problems,
          studies have also shown:<br>
          <br>
          •Use of acetaminophen during pregnancy may increase your risk
          of pre-eclampsia and thromboembolic diseases17<br>
          <br>
          •Taking the drug for more than four weeks during pregnancy,
          especially during the first and second trimester, moderately
          increases the risk of undescended testicles in boys18<br>
          <br>
          •Using acetaminophen in the third trimester increases your
          risk of preterm birth19<br>
          Acetaminophen After Birth Also Linked to Autism<br>
          <br>
          The use of acetaminophen after birth may also lead to
          problems. In fact, some argue the increased risk of autism we
          see following childhood vaccinations may in fact be due to the
          inappropriate use of acetaminophen after the shots are given —
          not the vaccines.20<br>
          <br>
          In my view, it seems irrational to give toxic injections a
          free pass, but acetaminophen administration could certainly
          make matters worse. A small preliminary study21 published in
          2008 concluded “acetaminophen use after measles-mumps-rubella
          vaccination was associated with autistic disorder.”<br>
          <br>
          Debunkers of the vaccine-autism connection point to statistics
          showing that, in the early 1980s, when the autism trend began
          its precipitously steep incline, vaccines were not only being
          added to the vaccination schedule, but pediatricians were also
          told to start using acetaminophen instead of aspirin, as
          aspirin had been linked to Reye’s syndrome.22<br>
          <br>
          A 2017 study23 even claims “The use of acetaminophen in babies
          and young children may be much more strongly associated with
          autism than its use during pregnancy, perhaps because of
          well-known deficiencies in the metabolic breakdown of
          pharmaceuticals during early development.”<br>
          <br>
          While parents give babies and infants Tylenol for numerous
          reasons, one instance in which Tylenol is routinely used is
          after childhood vaccinations, and according to research24
          published in the journal Lancet in 2009, acetaminophen might
          actually render vaccinations less effective when administered
          together, which is yet another reason to avoid giving
          acetaminophen to your baby.<br>
          <br>
          Infants who received acetaminophen right after getting a
          vaccination experienced lowered immune response, developing
          significantly fewer antibodies against the disease they were
          vaccinated against.<br>
          <br>
          The vaccines used in the study were for pneumococcal disease,
          Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), diphtheria, tetanus,
          whooping cough, hepatitis B, polio and rotavirus. The authors
          concluded that:<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Although febrile reactions significantly
          decreased, prophylactic administration of antipyretic drugs at
          the time of vaccination should not be routinely recommended
          since antibody responses to several vaccine antigens were
          reduced.”<br>

          <b>Understand the Risks Associated With Acetaminophen</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          Pregnant women are not the only ones that need to be careful
          in their use of this common pain reliever and fever reducer.
          Acetaminophen overdose is responsible for nearly half of all
          acute liver failure cases in the U.S.,25 and its use has also
          been linked to three serious skin reactions; two of which
          typically require hospitalization and can be fatal.<br>
          <br>
          These problems can happen to anyone. A major problem is that
          while acetaminophen is considered safe when taken as
          recommended, the margin between a safe dose and a potentially
          lethal one is very small.<br>
          <br>
          Provided you have a healthy liver and do not consume more than
          three alcoholic beverages a day, the recommended oral dose of
          acetaminophen is up to 1,000 milligrams (mg) every four to six
          hours, not to exceed 3 grams (3,000 mg) per day.26 As noted by
          U.S. San Diego Health:27<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “To appreciate how easy it is to exceed the
          safe limit, consider that one extra strength Tylenol tablet
          contains 500 mg of acetaminophen. Take two tablets at a single
          dose three times a day and you are at the maximum recommended
          dose.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you then inadvertently consume an
          acetaminophen-containing allergy medication or cold medication
          in addition, you risk damaging your liver … The key is to be
          aware of how much acetaminophen you are consuming.”<br>
          <br>
          What’s more, research28 has shown taking just a little more
          than the recommended dose over the course of several days or
          weeks (referred to as “staggered overdosing”) can be riskier
          than taking one large overdose. So, in summary, please be
          aware that your risk of severe liver injury and/or death
          increases if you:<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Take more than one regular strength (325
          mg) acetaminophen when combined with a narcotic analgesic like
          codeine or hydrocodone.<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Take more than the prescribed dose of an
          acetaminophen-containing product in a 24-hour period.<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Take more than one acetaminophen-containing
          product at the same time — Make sure to read the list of
          ingredients on any other over-the-counter (OTC) or
          prescription drug you take in combination.<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Drink alcohol while taking an acetaminophen
          product — Research29,30 suggests acetaminophen increases your
          risk of kidney damage by 123% if taken with alcohol, even if
          the amount of alcohol is small...<br>

          ...Results: The total distance and mean speed in open-field
          tests, and the time spent on rotarod in the MgT group were
          increased, compared with MPTP group. The MgT treatment but not
          MgSO4 dose-dependently attenuated the loss of TH-positive
          neurons, and the reduction of the TH expression in the SNpc.
          The MgT treatment also inhibited the expression of iNOS as
          measured by immunohistochemistry and Western blots.
          Double-immunofluorescence staining of TH and iNOS showed
          iNOS-positive cells were collocalized for TH-positive cells.<br>

          Conclusion: The treatment with MgT is associated with an

          significantly attenuate MPTP-induced motor deficits and
          dopamine (DA) neuron loss.<br>

              and causes serious heart problems, says shocking study in
              Spain</b><br>
            <b>By</b><b> Laurence Dollimore</b><br>
          </div>
          <br>
          A shocking study has warned that changing the clocks in autumn
          and spring can carry serious health risks to the population.<br>
          <br>
          The study was carried out by the world’s leading
          chronobiologists, including Dario Acuna, Physiology Professor
          at the University of Granada, which released the results in a
          press release.<br>
          <br>
          According to the research, the changing of the clocks ‘alters
          the circadian system which regulates and keeps the functions
          of the body under control.’<br>
          <br>
          The study, published in the prestigious European Journal of
          Internal Medicine, is now part of an international consensus
          on the impact of time change on the human body.<br>
          <br>
          According to the findings, switching time by an hour creates a
          sudden change in a person’s rhythm, since we all naturally
          keep to a 24-hour cycle.<br>
          <br>
          “The 24-hour system is controlled by the light and dark we
          experience, which in turn regulates the nocturnal production
          of melatonin,” said Acuna.<br>
          <br>
          “This is the true synchroniser of these rhythms.”<br>
          <br>
          health is based on the maintenance of the rhythmic changes of
          all the functions of our body, from the sleep / wake rhythm to
          the rhythm of brain neurotransmitters or even hormonal
          rhythms.”<br>
          <br>
          If the night time production of melatonin is interrupted, it
          can lead to a process called ‘internal desynchronisation’. <br>
          <br>
          This prevents the biological clock from being able to
          ‘maintain order’ in the body. <br>
          <br>
          It takes the average person three to five days to adjust their
          body clock and return to normal.<br>
          <br>
          Acuna warned: “That is enough time to produce mild, moderate
          or severe discomfort, including cognitive disorders (loss of
          attention or memory), sleep disturbances, cardiovascular
          problems and even favouring conditions for tumour growth.”<br>
          <br>
          According to the study, the changing of the clocks in spring
          leads to a 24% increase in severe cardiovascular events among
          women.<br>
          <br>
          The conclusions by the experts suggest that seasonal time
          change be permanently stopped. <br>
          <br>
          It comes as the European Commission is currently working
          towards that goal, hoping to end the twice annual event by
          2021.<br>

          <div align="center"><b>Once or twice weekly daytime nap linked
              to lower heart attack/stroke risk</b><br>
          </div>
          <br>
          A daytime nap taken once or twice a week may lower the risk of
          having a heart attack/stroke, finds research published online
          in the journal Heart. But no such association emerged for
          either greater frequency or duration of naps.<br>
          <br>
          The impact of napping on heart health has been hotly
          contested. Many of the published studies on the topic have
          failed to consider napping frequency, or focused purely on
          cardiovascular disease deaths, or compared regular nappers
          with those not opting for a mini siesta, say the researchers.<br>
          <br>
          In a bid to try and address these issues, they looked at the
          association between napping frequency and average nap duration
          and the risk of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular disease
          'events,' such as heart attack, stroke, or heart failure,
          among 3462 randomly selected residents of Lausanne,
          Switzerland.<br>
          <br>
          Each participant was aged between 35 and 75, when recruited
          between 2003 and 2006 to the CoLaus study. This has been
          looking at the factors behind the development of
          cardiovascular disease.<br>
          <br>
          Participants' first check-up took place between 2009 and 2012,
          when information on their sleep and nap patterns in the
          previous week was collected, and their health was then
          subsequently monitored for an average of 5 years.<br>
          <br>
          Over half (58%, 2014) of the participants said they didn't nap
          during the previous week; around one in five (19%, 667) said
          they took one to two naps; around one in 10 (12%, 411) said
          they took three to five; while a similar proportion (11%, 370)
          said they took six to seven.<br>
          <br>
          Frequent nappers (3-7 naps a week) tended to be older, male,
          smokers, weigh more, and to sleep for longer at night than
          those who said they didn't nap during the day.<br>
          <br>
          And they reported more daytime sleepiness and more severe
          obstructive sleep apnoea—a condition in which the walls of the
          throat relax and narrow during sleep, interrupting normal
          breathing.<br>
          <br>
          During the monitoring period, there were 155 fatal and
          non-fatal cardiovascular disease 'events'.<br>
          <br>
          Occasional napping, once to twice weekly, was associated with
          an almost halving in attack/stroke/heart failure risk (48%)
          compared with those who didn't nap at all.<br>
          <br>
          This association held true after taking account of potentially
          influential factors, such as age, and nighttime sleep
          duration, as well as other cardiovascular disease risks, such
          as high blood pressure/cholesterol.<br>
          <br>
          And it didn't change after factoring in excessive daytime
          sleepiness, depression, and regularly sleeping for at least 6
          hours a night. Only older age (65+) and severe sleep apnoea
          affected it.<br>
          <br>
          But the 67% heightened cardiovascular risk initially observed
          for frequent nappers virtually disappeared after taking
          account of potentially influential factors. And no
          associations with cardiovascular disease 'events' were found
          for nap length (from 5 minutes to 1 hour plus).<br>
          <br>
          This is an observational study, and as such, can't establish
          cause, added to which the information on nap and sleep
          patterns relied on personal recall. But nap frequency may help
          to explain the differing conclusions reached by researchers
          about the impact of napping on heart health, suggest the study
          authors.<br>
          <br>
          In a linked editorial, Drs Yue Leng and Kristine Yaffe, of the
          University of California at San Francisco, USA, point out that
          research in this area is hampered by the absence of a gold
          standard for defining and measuring naps, making it "premature
          to conclude on the appropriateness of napping for maintaining
          optimal heart health."<br>
          <br>
          But they add: "While the exact physiological pathways linking
          daytime napping to [cardiovascular disease] risk is not clear,
          [this research] contributes to the ongoing debate on the
          health implications of napping, and suggests that it might not
          only be the duration, but also the frequency that matters."<br>
          <br>
          And they conclude: "The study of napping is a challenging but
          also a promising field with potentially significant public
          health implications. While there remain more questions than
          answers, it is time to start unveiling the power of naps for a
          supercharged heart." <br>

              Hypervelocity Impact Resistant Structures</b><br>

          <b>Abstract</b><b><br>
          </b>Lightweight materials with high ballistic impact
          resistance and load&#8208;bearing capabilities are regarded as a
          holy grail in materials design. Nature builds these
          complementary properties into materials using soft organic
          materials with optimized, complex geometries. Here, the
          compressive deformation and ballistic impact properties of
          three different 3D printed polymer structures, named
          tubulanes, are reported, which are the architectural analogues
          of cross&#8208;linked carbon nanotubes. The results show that
          macroscopic tubulanes are remarkable high load&#8208;bearing,
          hypervelocity impact&#8208;resistant lightweight structures. They
          exhibit a lamellar deformation mechanism, arising from the
          tubulane ordered pore structure, manifested across multiple
          length scales from nano to macro dimensions. This approach of
          using complex geometries inspired by atomic and nanoscale
          models to generate macroscale printed structures allows
          innovative morphological engineering of materials with tunable
          mechanical responses.<br>

          <b>Abstract</b><br>
          The development of power generators that can function in harsh
          snowy environments and in contact with snow can be beneficial
          but challenging to accomplish. Herein, we introduce the first
          snow-based triboelectric nanogenerator (snow-TENG) that can be
          used as an energy harvester and a multifunctional sensor based
          on the principle of snow-triboelectrification. In this work,
          we used a 3D printing technique for the precise design and
          deposition of the electrode and triboelectric layer, leading
          to flexible, stretchable and metal-free triboelectric
          generators. Based on the single electrode mode, the device can
          generate an instantaneous output power density as high as
          0.2&#8239;mW/m2, an open circuit voltage up to 8&#8239;V, and a current
          density of 40&#8239;&#956;A/m2. In addition, the snow-TENG can function
          as a miniaturized weather station to monitor the weather in
          real time to provide accurate information about the snowfall
          rate, snow accumulation depth, wind direction, and speed in
          snowy and/or icy environments. In addition, the snow-TENG can
          be used as a wearable power source and biomechanical sensor to
          detect human body motions, which may prove useful for
          snow-related sports. Unlike conventional sensor platforms, our
          design works without the need for batteries or image
          processing systems. We envision these devices could
          potentially be integrated into solar panels to ensure
          continuous power supply during snowy weather conditions.<br>

          Health Ranger: In 2020, I’m going to publicly release a
          breakthrough, low-cost technology for making your own
          anti-cancer nanoparticle medicine at home, for pennies<br>
          <br>
          ...You will soon learn how to make your own “structured
          nanoparticles” anti-cancer medicine for pennies per dose<br>
          <br>
          I have been working on this discovery for at least half a year
          or so. The discovery consists of a simple, low-cost and safe
          way to manufacture what the scientific community calls
          “botanically end-capped structured nanoparticles” which are
          created using a process called “biosynthesis.”<br>
          <br>
          Incredibly inexpensive to manufacture, and I’ll show you how<br>
          <br>
          What really surprised me in this research effort was
          discovering how easily these structured nanoparticles can be
          created. Even though I founded and run a multi-million dollar
          laboratory facility (ISO accredited, multiple mass-spec
          instruments, full chemistry lab, etc.) through a series of
          simple experiments, I was able to simplify the structured
          nanoparticle creation process to something so simple that any
          person can do this in their own home, using remarkable simple,
          low-cost equipment.<br>
          <br>
          For example, one of the pieces of equipment necessary for this
          process is nothing more than a $5 tea strainer.<br>
          <br>
          What’s amazing is that when you follow the procedure I will be
          releasing in an upcoming video (on Brighteon.com, the free
          speech alternative to YouTube), you will be able to witness
          the nanoparticle biosynthesis with your own eyes as the
          formation of the molecules takes place. Although you can’t see
          the individual molecules, you can directly witness the changes
          in the spectral transmission of the molecules, which is both
          detectable by UV systems (HPLC systems with a UV detector) as
          well as with the naked human eye.<br>
          <br>
          In fact, I have a stunning video of the biosynthesis process
          taking place in a beaker, and that video will be released
          along with the process of how to replicate this yourself using
          safe, low-cost methods.<br>
          <br>
          By the way, there is no cooking or heating of any materials
          necessary to achieve this result. The only energy inputs come
          from common batteries, as I will reveal in the upcoming video
          that shares the full details. What this means is that this
          technology can also be used in a SHTF / survival scenario,
          even when the power grid is down.<br>
          The video and the process will all be released to the public
          at no charge as a way of achieving “distributed medicine” for
          the world...<br>

          </b>Extracellular synthesis of copper nanoparticles was
          carried out using stem latex of a medicinally important plant,
          Euphorbia nivulia. The nanoparticles were stabilized and

          the latex. The protein capping is a promising biocompatible
          vehicle for destruction of tumor/cancer cells. The
          cytotoxicity potential of the plant protein capped
          nanoparticles was evaluated using various parameters like MTT
          cell viability assay and extracellular lactate dehydrogenase
          (LDH) release in cancer cell line. Other parameters that

              Hep G2 Cells</b><br>
            <b>by Jun Ding, et al.</b><br>

          <br>
          &nbsp;Abstract: Epirubicin-capped silver nanoparticles (NPs)
          were synthesized through a one-pot method by using epirubicin
          as both the functional drug and the reducing agent of Ag+ to
          Ag0. The preparation process was accomplished in 1 h. In
          addition, the obtained epirubicin-capped silver nanoparticle
          was characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM),
          energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), and infrared
          spectroscopy. The results showed that a layer of polymer
          epirubicin had formed around the silver nanoparticle, which
          was 30-40 nm in diameter. We further investigated the
          antitumor activity of the prepared epirubicin-capped silver
          nanoparticle, and the half maximal inhibitory concentration
          (IC50) against Hep G2 cells was 1.92 &#956;g/mL, indicating a good
          antitumor property of the nanoparticle at low dosage.<br>
          <br>
          <b>&nbsp;Introduction</b><b><br>
          </b>Nanoparticles (NPs), ranging from 1 to 100 nm in size,
          have gained considerable interest because of their various
          potential applications in clinical nanomedicine and research
          [1,2,3]. Noble metal NPs, especially silver NPs, with the
          properties of large specific surface area, enhanced surface
          plasmon resonance, and minimal side effects have been proposed
          for potential use in the anticancer area [4,5]. For instance,
          Ag NPs of approximately 50 nm in size can target tumor tissues
          based on the enhanced permeation and retention (EPR) effect
          [6,7], and the photo-thermal conversion in Ag NPs can increase
          the temperature locally, thereby achieving therapeutic killing
          of tumor cells [8,9,10]. Clearly, Ag NPs represent a promising
          anticancer agent with the assistance of photo-thermal therapy.
          However, the therapeutic effect of bare Ag NPs is limited. The
          functionalization of Ag NPs with anticancer drugs is a
          promising method to provide synergistic effects by combining
          both therapeutic actions, resulting in better anticancer
          effects.<br>
          <br>
          Typically, drug-loaded Ag NPs are fabricated by top-down and
          bottom-up approaches. In the top-down method, a silver NP core
          is first obtained, and then post-modification and drug-loading
          steps are performed [11,12]. Obviously, the process is
          complicated and time-consuming, and the morphology control of
          the final particles is also troublesome. As for bottom-up
          methods, drugs could be incorporated directly into Ag NPs
          during the growth of starting materials, which is more
          convenient. However, the chemical reducing agent required by
          the method, such as NaBH4, pyridine, etc., might lead to the
          presence of toxic reagents existing on or in Ag NPs [13],
          which would bring about adverse effects in further biological
          or medical applications. Moreover, the recently reported
          bottom-up methods mostly chose to load plant extract onto Ag
          NPs [14,15,16], possibly resulting in an undefined curative
          effect or side effect. Therefore, a new green and simple
          strategy to prepare drug-capped Ag NPs is highly favorable.<br>
          <br>
          <b>&nbsp;2. Materials and Methods</b><b><br>
          </b><b>2.1. Chemicals and Reagents</b><br>
          Silver nitrate (99.8%) was obtained from Aladdin (Shanghai,
          China). Epirubicin (98%) was purchased from Melonepharma
          (Dalian, China). Fetal calf serum (FCS) was purchased from
          Sijiqing Co. (Hangzhou, China). Dulbecco’s modified eagle
          medium was supplied by Gibco (Waltham, MA, USA).
          3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide
          (MTT) was obtained from Biosharp (Hefei, China). Ultra-pure
          water used throughout the study was purified with the Milli-Q
          system (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA).<br>
          <br>
          <b>2.2. Preparation of Epirubicin-Capped Silver NPs</b><br>
          Epirubicin-capped silver NPs were obtained using a green and
          mild procedure [18,19]. First, a AgNO3-MilliQ water solution
          (10&#8722;2 M) was heated till boiling at 120 °C under magnetic
          stirring. Subsequently, an epirubicin solution was added to
          obtain the final concentration of 10&#8722;4 (w/v). After reacting
          at 120 °C for 1 h, the resultant epirubicin-capped silver NPs
          were obtained. Subsequently, excess unreacted epirubicin was
          removed by dialysis in ultra-pure water for 48 h [20,21]. The
          final product was obtained by centrifugation at 10,000× g for
          30 min...<br>
          <br>
          <b>4. Conclusions</b><br>
          In summary, we have presented a one-pot synthesis method for
          fabricating epirubicin-capped silver NPs. The reaction was
          accomplished by the fast chemical reaction between a silver
          salt solution and epirubicin without using any surfactant,
          thus making the method simple, green, and mild. The resultant
          epirubicin-capped silver NPs exhibited a great anticancer
          property at low dosage. Considering the mechanisms of the
          synthesis method, the universality of the proposed method
          should be further evaluated, which is an ongoing study in our
          laboratory. Taken together, this approach represents a new
          option for preparing drug-loaded Ag NPs with a broad
          application prospect in clinic.<br>

          Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) proved the
          presence of Fe metallic ions. The structural characteristic
          using Field emission scanning electron microscopy with energy
          dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (FESEM-EDX) and Transmission
          electron microscopy (TEM) analysis revealed hexagonal nanorods
          with agglomeration. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) calculated
          the average size of FeONPs around 52.78&#8239;nm and differential
          scanning colorimetry (DSC) proved the stability of FeONPs till
          higher temperature of 165.52&#8239;°C. As an application part, the
          synthesized FeONPs showed potential antibacterial activity as
          individual and incorporating material over cotton fabrics
          against Gram negative and Gram positive pathogens. FeONPs
          showed higher antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli,
          Klebsiella pneumoniae and lesser antibacterial activity
          against Staphylococcus aureus. The photocatalytic ability of
          the synthesized FeONPs was demonstrated by the degrading
          crystal violet dye under solar irradiation upto 80%. Thus,
          FeONPs synthesized using Ruellia tuberosa could play a vital
          role in killing the bacterial pathogens and degrading dye for
          the bioremediation of wastewater from industrial and domestic
          sources.<br>

          With the advent of nanotechnology, many related industries
          rapidly developed over the recent past. Generally, top-down
          and bottom-up approaches are the two major processes used to
          synthesize nanoparticles; most of these require high
          temperatures, vacuum conditions, and harsh/toxic chemicals. As
          a consequence, adverse effects impacted organisms including
          humans. Some synthesis methods are expensive and
          time-consuming. As a corollary, the concept of "green
          nanotechnology" emerged with the green synthesis of
          nanoparticles commencing a new epoch in nanotechnology. This
          involves the synthesis of nanomaterial from microorganisms,
          macroorganisms, and other biological materials. Honey is
          documented as the world's oldest food source with exceptional
          medical, chemical, physical, and pharmaceutical values. Honey
          mediated green synthesis is a relatively novel concept used
          during the past few years to synthesize gold, silver, carbon,
          platinum, and palladium nanoparticles. Honey acts as both a
          stabilizing and a reducing agent and importantly functions as
          a precursor in nanoparticle synthesis. This method usually
          requires room temperature and does not produce toxic
          byproducts. In conclusion, honey mediated green synthesis of
          nanoparticles provides a simple, cost effective,
          biocompatible, reproducible, rapid, and safe method. The
          special activity of honey functionalized nanoparticles may
          provide valuable end products with numerous applications in
          diverse fields. <br>

            biocompatible gold nanoparticles simultaneously possessing
            plasmonic, antioxidant and antimicrobial properties</b><b><br>
          </b><b>&nbsp;Benedec D, et al.</b><b><br>
          </b><b><br>
          </b>Purpose: The leaves and flowering stem of Origanum vulgare
          contain essential oils, flavonoids, phenolic acids and
          anthocyanins. We propose a new, simple, one-pot, O. vulgare
          extract (OVE) mediated green synthesis method of biocompatible
          gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) possessing improved antioxidant,
          antimicrobial and plasmonic properties.<br>
          <br>
          Materials and methods: Different concentrations of OVEs were
          used to reduce gold ions and to synthetize biocompatible
          spherical AuNPs. Their morphology and physical properties have
          been investigated by means of transmission electron
          microscopy, ultraviolet–visible absorption spectroscopy,
          photon correlation spectroscopy and Fourier transform infrared
          spectroscopy, whereas their plasmonic properties have been
          tested using surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS). The
          antioxidant properties of nanoparticles (NPs) have been
          evaluated by 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging
          assay, and the antimicrobial tests were performed using the
          disk diffusion assay. Their cytotoxicity has been assessed by
          means of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
          bromide assay.<br>
          <br>
          Results: The experimental results confirmed the successful
          synthesis of biocompatible, spherical, plasmonic NPs having a
          mean diameter of ~40 nm and an outstanding aqueous stability.
          This new class of NPs exhibits a very good antioxidant
          activity and presents interesting inhibitory effects against
          Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans. Due to their
          plasmonic properties, AuNPs are used as SERS substrates for
          the detection of a test molecule (methylene blue) up to a
          concentration of 10-7 M and a pharmaceutical compound
          (propranolol) in solution. Cytotoxicity assays revealed that
          AuNPs are better tolerated by normal human dermal fibroblast
          cells, while the melanoma cancer cells are more sensitive.<br>
          Conclusion: The biocompatible AuNPs synthetized using OVEs
          showed significant bactericidal and antimycotic activities,
          the most sensitive microorganisms being S. aureus and C.
          albicans, both commonly involved in various dermatological
          infections. Moreover, the significant antioxidant effect might
          recommend their use for protective and/or preventive effect in
          various skin inflammatory conditions, including the reduction
          in side effects in dermatological infections. Meanwhile, the
          as-synthesized biocompatible AuNPs can be successfully used as
          SERS substrates for the detection of pharmaceutical compounds
          in aqueous solutions.<br>

              scientists convert all types to O using gut bacteria</b><br>
          </div>
          <br>
          &nbsp;In a breakthrough that could save thousands of lives,
          scientists have found a way to convert all blood types to the
          universal type that is safe for all patients to receive, by
          using microbes found in the human gut.<br>
          <br>
          Researchers from the University of British Columbia have
          figured out how to convert blood types A, B and AB into the
          universal Type O, which all patients can receive in a
          transfusion, regardless of their own blood type.<br>
          <br>
          Blood types are differentiated by the kinds of sugar found on
          the surface of red blood cells. Type O has no sugars.
          Scientists had realized that some enzymes can remove the
          sugars from A, B and AB blood cells, turning them into Type O,
          but they hadn’t found an enzyme that was safe, efficient and
          economical, until they considered the gut.<br>
          <br>
          The human digestive tract has the same sugars found on blood
          cells, and bacterial enzymes found in feces strip the sugars
          from the lining to aid digestion. The scientists were able to
          isolate the enzyme and use it to strip blood of its sugars in
          a more efficient way than any other enzyme.<br>
          <br>
          The scientists made the exciting discovery last August, but
          have just published the results of their research in the
          journal Nature Microbiology.<br>
          <br>
          The next step is for the team to test the enzyme conversion in
          a clinical setting to see if there are any side effects of the
          procedure. If none are found, the future of blood donation
          will change for the better.<br>

          Enzymes can be used to convert A and B type red blood cells
          (RBC) into O type, broadening the supply. However the enzymes
          available to date have not worked well on whole blood, thus
          new enzymes are needed. We in the Withers Laboratories asked:
          Where do we find those enzymes?<br>
          <br>
          Interestingly the answer to this question was, within us! In
          recent years the research community has started to realize the
          importance of the human microbiome in the context of human
          health. However, it may prove to be even more important since
          the microorganisms within us also harbor enzyme activities we
          do not even known about, yet. The human gut is covered with
          mucins, large glycoproteins presenting a variety of glycan
          structures on their surface, including those of the blood
          group antigens. Bacteria within the gut derive some of their
          energy by foraging these glycans, so must produce enzymes to
          cut them off. We investigated this community by use of
          functional metagenomics - a technique that allows the
          screening of enzyme activity without culture bias. By
          screening a library of gut microbiome enzymes using
          fluorogenic substrates that mimic the blood antigen
          carbohydrates, we identified a set of enzymes expressed by a
          particular bacterium, Flavonifractor plautii, that are able to
          cleave the A antigen very efficiently.<br>
          <br>
          An important factor in the efficient cleavage of substrates
          bound to cell surfaces, such as the A antigens on the RBCs, is
          the ability of the enzyme to associate with the cell surface.
          Some enzymes do this by acquiring a net charge that is
          complementary to that of the cell surface. In our case the
          enzymes carry carbohydrate binding modules (CBMs) that
          interact with other cell surface glycans allowing them to
          rapidly cleave the nearby A antigens.&nbsp; The combination of
          high substrate activity and affinity for the RBC surface makes
          our enzymes very efficient in the removal of A antigens from
          RBCs in whole blood samples.<br>
          <br>
          In the future we hope these enzymes will be widely deployed
          for the production of enzymatically converted universal donor
          blood (ECO O Type RBCs) directly after blood donation. In
          addition to their use in RBC conversion we plan to test the
          use of these and related enzymes in the removal of antigens
          from other important cell surfaces and tissues.&nbsp; Such
          approaches could widen the availability of good “matches” in
          organ and stem cell transplantation's.<br>
          <br>
          For me it was very interesting to see what our gut microbiome
          had to offer and I am keen to see what kind of other
          activities will be discovered within the human gut microbiome
          in the future.<br>

          <b>Abstract</b><b><br>
          </b>Access to efficient enzymes that can convert A and B type
          red blood cells to ‘universal’ donor O would greatly increase
          the supply of blood for transfusions. Here we report the
          functional metagenomic screening of the human gut microbiome
          for enzymes that can remove the cognate A and B type sugar
          antigens. Among the genes encoded in our library of 19,500
          expressed fosmids bearing gut bacterial DNA, we identify an
          enzyme pair from the obligate anaerobe Flavonifractor plautii
          that work in concert to efficiently convert the A antigen to
          the H antigen of O type blood, via a galactosamine
          intermediate. The X-ray structure of the N-acetylgalactosamine
          deacetylase reveals the active site and mechanism of the
          founding member of an esterase family. The galactosaminidase
          expands activities within the CAZy family GH36. Their ability
          to completely convert A to O of the same rhesus type at very
          low enzyme concentrations in whole blood will simplify their
          incorporation into blood transfusion practice, broadening
          blood supply.<br>

          </div>
          Dear Frau Merkel,<br>
          <br>
          You are the most despicable and criminal Chancellor the German
          people have ever had to endure. You brought the German people
          terror, war, poverty and death by deliberately and illegally
          importing illegal migrants into the country, hundreds of
          thousands of mercenaries, terrorists and other die-hard
          criminals.<br>
          <br>
          According to article 16 of the constitution, not one of those
          who arrive through safe countries has the right of asylum in
          Germany. That is why all your guests are illegal criminals in
          Germany. The Schengen and Dublin agreements were also
          deliberately illegal. In the vow you have sworn, among other
          things, to keep harmful things away from the German people,
          but you do, every day, exactly the opposite.<br>
          <br>
          You have no mandate to deal with the needs of all citizens,
          but only for the good of the German people, this alone was
          your mandate. You are nothing but an employee of the German
          people, for the power belongs to the people, and not you.<br>
          <br>
          You consciously incited the entire nation against each other,
          split it and destroyed entire families. And you cap it all by
          insolently repeating the lie that we Germans are doing better
          than ever?<br>
          <br>
          Due to your illegal guests, all public events must now be
          massively secured, surrounded by fences and guards armed with
          automatic weapons. There are now protection areas for women
          who seek protection so that they will hopefully not fall
          victim to sexual abuse committed by your guests. Every day
          your guests commit crimes of shocking violence.<br>
          <br>
          Poverty among our elders and children is higher than ever.
          Almost a million Germans live on the streets. Helping these
          people, this was your mandate, and not flooding all of Europe
          with invaders from other cultures and feeding them with
          billions of hard tax taxes. Are you asking for respect?<br>
          <br>
          Your invaders, mostly criminals, who rape and kill in Germany,
          are then taken under your defense (and mainstream media /
          police) and portrayed as victims of “Right-wingers”. If you
          really wanted respect and possess a conscience, you would
          answer for your crimes before a court.<br>
          <br>
          If justice does not visit you the people will because power
          belongs exclusively to the people, and the German people are
          your employers.&nbsp; You are nobody. No Chancellor has ever
          intentionally caused the German people so much harm and
          suffering.<br>
          <br>
          For the future, I only want one thing: that you and your
          entire entourage be brought before a court of justice for all
          the law violations and you and your cohorts go to prison for
          at least for life. Such a high betrayal of the sovereign
          people never existed in the history of Germany.<br>
          <br>
          Paid commentators and hypocrites who still lick your rear,
          unable to think clearly and with their own mind, can refrain
          from any other adulation of you, for no reasonable man take
          such people seriously. I despise you deeply and wish you the
          punishment you deserve.&nbsp; With much contempt, thanks to
          your Stasi platoon.<br>

              explaining Google’s criminal racketeering and fraud</b><br>
          </div>
          <b><br>
          </b>Just four days ago, Dr. Mercola — who has been hit with
          99.9% censorship by Google — went public with a damning
          indictment of Google’s treacherous, even criminal racketeering
          and anti-trust practices.<br>
          <br>
          The following video, uploaded under the Mercola channel on
          Brighteon.com, is a must-see video for all who care about
          health freedom and the criminal racketeering of the tech
          giants:<br>
          <br>
          <a href="https://www.brighteon.com/channel/mercola"
            "><b>https://www.brighteon.com/channel/mercola</b><b><br>
            </b></a><br>
          Dr. Joseph Mercola is one of the pioneers of online natural
          health knowledge that has provided enormous benefits to
          humanity, and Google’s malicious censorship of his site (and
          others, like Natural News) is clearly a case of criminal
          racketeering, especially given that Google is involved in the
          pharmaceutical industry.<br>
          <br>
          According to Dr. Mercola’s video, Google is also about to jump
          into the vaccine industry, which explains the extreme
          censorship against vaccine truth information.<br>
          <br>
          Furthermore, over the last several years, Google has censored
          supplement ads on its Google Adwords platform while pushing
          prescription medication ads to the forefront. With the
          censorship of natural health sites now ramped up to insane
          levels, it’s clearly that Google is now functioning as the
          propaganda front for Big Pharma, making sure people never
          discover natural cures and prevention strategies that would
          deny profits to Big Pharma.<br>
          <br>
          These anti-trust crimes by Google, Facebook, YouTube and even
          Twitter need to be investigated and prosecuted at the highest
          levels. America is being turned into a “pharma state” that’s
          controlled by drug company interests and tyrannical tech
          giants which have utterly abandoned any pretense of respecting
          the earned search engine rankings for content that questions
          the status quo.<br>
          <br>
          Google is flat-out conspiring with Big Pharma to turn hundreds
          of millions of Americans into drug patients by denying them
          access to lifesaving health information that could
          dramatically lower health care costs and save lives across our
          nation.<br>
          <br>
          Google is evil. And this evil must be stopped.<br>
          <br>
          Share Dr. Mercola’s videos on Brighteon.com to help spread the
          word as we continue to build new platforms for truth about
          health and freedom.<br>
          <br>
          Hint: We’re working on a new project that will make Google
          obsolete for natural health information, and Mercola’s content
          will be among the articles that are featured.<br>
          <br>
          If humanity is to survive the scourge of Big Pharma and its
          evil tech partners like Google, humanity must declare war on
          Google and tear it down.<br>

            <i>You are not a moral leader. But I will tell you what you
              are.</i><br>
            <b>Jason D. Hill</b><br>
          </div>
          <br>
          Greta Thunberg:<br>
          <br>
          You have declared yourself a leader and said that your
          generation will start a revolution. You have comported
          yourself as a credentialed adult and climate change activist
          who has fearlessly addressed politicians and world leaders.
          You have dropped out of school and declared that there isn’t
          any reason to attend, or any reason for you to study since
          there will be no future for you to inherit. You have, rather
          than attend your classes, been leading Friday Climate Strikes
          for all students in your generation across the globe. Your
          attendance at oil pipelines has been striking. There, you
          unequivocally declare that all oil needs to remain in the
          ground where it belongs.<br>
          <br>
          I shall, therefore, against the backdrop of your activism,
          address you as an adult rather than as a child.<br>
          <br>
          In September of 2019 you crossed the Atlantic in a “zero
          carbon” racing yacht that had no toilet and electric light on
          board. You made an impassioned plea at the United Nations in
          which you claimed that, “we have stolen your dreams and our
          childhood with our empty words.”&nbsp; You claimed that adults
          and world leaders come to young people for answers and
          explained in anger: “How dare you!” You claimed that we are
          failing you and that young people are beginning to understand
          our betrayal. You further declared that if we continue to fail
          your generation: “We will never forgive you.”<br>
          <br>
          You have stated that you want us to panic, and to act as if
          our homes are on fire. You insist that rich countries must
          reduce to zero emissions immediately. In your speeches you
          attack economic growth and have stated that our current
          climate crisis is caused by “buying and building things.” You
          call for climate justice and equity, without addressing the
          worst polluter on the planet China; the country that is
          economically annexing much of Africa and Latin America. You
          dare not lecture Iran about its uranium projects -- because
          that’s not part of the UN’s agenda, is it?<br>
          <br>
          You proclaim that we need to live within the planetary
          boundaries, to focus on equity and “take a few steps back” for
          the sake of all living species. You resent the hierarchical
          distinctions between human and animals and entertain no
          qualitative distinction between a monkey, a malaria-infested
          mosquito and a snarling hyena. You mouth slogans such as: “We
          have set in motion an irreversible chain reaction beyond
          control,” and you advocate for universal veganism on the Ellen
          DeGeneres show. You do not buy new clothes, and you don’t want
          the rest of us to either. You want us all to stop flying in
          jet planes without giving us an alternative as to how we would
          re-transform our financial and trading systems—to say nothing
          of our personal enjoyment of the world—without regression to a
          primeval era. Few can afford to cross the Atlantic in a $6M
          zero carbon yacht financed by rich people who made their
          wealth by the very means you condemn as loathsome.<br>
          <br>
          There are a few things that we, the rational adults of the
          world who are not bowing to you like guilt-ridden obsequious
          Babbitts need to say to you, Greta.<br>
          <br>
          First, we did not rob you of your childhood or of your dreams.
          You are the legatee of a magnificent technological
          civilization which my generation and the one before it and
          several others preceding it all the way to the Industrial
          Revolution and the Renaissance, bequeathed to you. That
          growth-driven, capitalist technological civilization has
          created the conditions for you to harangue us over our
          betrayal. It is a civilization that eradicated diseases such
          as small pox from the word, and that lifted millions out of
          abject poverty in a universe you think is dying and decaying.
          It assured you a life expectancy that exceeded that of your
          ancestors. Most likely by focusing on economic growth which
          you demonize, and scientific advancement, that civilization
          will further enhance a robust quality of life and health for
          your descendants.<br>
          <br>
          Here is a hard truth to ponder, Greta: if the great producers
          of this world whom you excoriate were to withdraw their
          productivity, wealth and talents—in short—their minds from the
          world today, your generation would simply perish. Why? Because
          as children you have done nothing as yet, with your lives
          besides being born. This is what we expect of children until
          such time as they can be producers by learning from their
          elders. You are understandably social and ecological ballast.
          You are not yet cognitively advanced to replicate the
          structures of survival of which you are the beneficiaries.<br>
          <br>
          Children are important installments on the future. We have
          invested in you. It is you and your smug generation which
          think they have nothing to learn from the older ones who are
          failing themselves. Whom do you expect to employ the majority
          of you if you have neither the job credentials or life
          competency skills to navigate the world? The future
          unemployable-skipping- school-on-Friday obstreperous children?<br>
          <br>
          The truth, as one anonymous blogger aptly put it, is that your
          generation is unable to work up to forty hours per week
          without being chronically depressed and anxious. Its members
          cannot even decide if they want to be a boy or a girl, or
          both, or neither, or a “they.” They cannot eat meat without
          crying. I might add that your generation needs “trigger
          warnings” and “safe spaces” as pre-conditions for learning in
          school. Its members have a pathological need to be coddled and
          protected from the challenging realities of life. Your
          generation is the biggest demander and consumer of carbon
          spewing technological gadgets and devices. An hour without any
          of them and too many of you succumb to paralyzing lethargy.
          Your generation is the least curious and most insular set of
          individuals one has ever encountered. Your hubris extends so
          far that you think you have nothing to learn from your elders.<br>
          <br>
          Yes, we have betrayed you: by capitulating the world of
          leadership to bored, attention-deficit children who spout
          bromides, platitudes and slogans that a rudderless and morally
          relativistic culture accepts because a significant number of
          its denizens have become intellectually bankrupt and morally
          lazy.<br>
          <br>
          The logical endpoint of your ecological vision would see us
          living in primeval conditions eking out an existence in jungle
          swamps in which we would regard poisonous snakes and
          man-eating tigers as our moral equals. We would have to adapt
          ourselves to nature rather than adapt nature to meet our
          needs, like all members of civilized civilizations do. Your
          vision would see us foraging for mushrooms and plants without
          knowing which were inimical to our digestive systems. Under
          your system we would swelter from heat, die from rampant
          plagues and starvation because there will be no
          air-conditioning units, no sophisticated plumbing and
          irrigations and sewer systems, no anti-bacterial soap made
          from animal matter, no pesticides and chemicals to sanitize
          our food and drinking supplies: just one primordial swamp of
          human putrefaction.<br>
          <br>
          If civilization is left in the hands of your ecofascist
          supporters we will be living in grass huts, drinking animal
          feces infested water, and shrinking in fear from polar bears
          instead of killing them for food when they attack us.<br>
          <br>
          Greta, living in complete harmony with nature is the death of
          creativity. Understand this. All great civilizations were
          forged in the crucibles of proper exploitation of the earth.
          Those who lived on land with oil and did nothing with it never
          had a right to it in the first place. Non-usage of God’s
          resources is the cardinal sin because it results in the
          un-development of our human capabilities, and makes us
          indistinguishable from beasts.<br>
          <br>
          Your generation needs to be taught the morality of wealth
          creation, rather than only parasitically benefiting from it.
          The only revolution you will lead is one into nihilism and
          civilization regression. You need to learn about the moral
          case for fossil fuel. You owe it to yourself to understand how
          as, Kathleen Hartnett White has detailed, the harnessing of
          the vast store of concentrated energy in fossil fuels allowed
          mankind, for the first time in human history, to escape
          intractable constraints and energy limits that had left all
          but the very privileged in total poverty and depravity. Before
          the Industrial Revolution all societies were dependent on a
          very limited flow of solar energy captured in living plants
          for subsistence needs such as food, fuel and shelter.<br>
          <br>
          But we, the creative enterprisers, will not go back to the
          Dark Ages. Your philosophy can be summed up as follows:&nbsp;
          <br>
          <br>
          What was good for my anthropoid ancestors is good for me. Do
          not rock the boat, or even build one as that will require
          cutting down a tree. Do not disrupt nature. Do not dare to see
          the earth as rightfully belonging to us. We don’t have the
          right to use our brains in a manner that can transform our
          needs into a material form. Let’s conveniently forget that
          production is the application of reason to the problems of
          survival. Let’s all diminish the grandeur of man and his
          luminous potential. Crush the Thomas Edisons of this world.<br>
          <br>
          The apocalyptic world vision you hold has been a strip landing
          for those who have hated progress throughout history. Your
          apocalyptic predictions have been made for millennia, and,
          we’re still here. We will still be here long after you’ve
          grown up and we have forgiven you for skipping classes,
          thereby lowering the intelligence quotient of an entire
          generation.<br>

          A Canadian company is lifting aviation to new heights with the
          world’s first airplane made entirely from hemp. The fiber
          comes from the stalk of cannabis (marijuana) plants and has no
          mind-altering properties.<br>
          <br>
          The hemp plane was engineered by Hempearth Group to carry the
          pilot and up to four passengers. The small plane has a
          wingspan of 36 feet and is powered by Hemp Jet A Bio Fuel and
          100% hemp oil. The seats, wings, walls, and fabric pillows are
          all made from – you guessed it – hemp...<br>

            <br>
            Fire ants and a diving bell spider have inspired the
            creation of a new metal that is so water resistant that it
            could one day lead to the creation of unsinkable ships.<br>
            <br>
            The metal is created using very short bursts of lasers to
            'etch' tiny patterns on its surface that trap air.<br>
            <br>
            Even if the metal is forced to sink, it will return to the
            surface and continue to float as soon as the pressure is
            removed, according to researchers from the University of
            Rochester.<br>
            <br>
            This could lead to an unsinkable ship, a wearable flotation
            device that will still float after being punctured and even
            electronic monitoring devices that can survive in long term
            in the ocean,' said Professor Chunlei Guo, who led the study<br>
            <br>
            Fire ants are able to survive long periods of time under or
            on the surface of water by joining their limbs together to
            form a raft. <br>
            <br>
            They then trap air among their very water-resistant bodies,
            which keeps them afloat.<br>
            <br>
            The team also took inspiration from Diving Bell Spiders,
            also known as Argyroneta aquatic spiders.<br>
            <br>
            The diving bell spider creates a dome-shaped web that it
            fills with air from the surface then carries between its
            water resistant legs and abdomen. <br>
            <br>
            It then uses the air in the dome to breathe, only visiting
            the surface when it needs to refill.<br>
            <br>
            Professor Guo used this method of preserving air in a bubble
            to ensure that even after long periods of time underwater,
            his metal structures would still hold enough air to be able
            to float when returned to the surface.<br>
            <br>
            The process involves placing two treated metal surfaces
            facing inwards with just enough space between them to create
            a bubble of air.&nbsp; <br>
            <br>
            The surfaces become superhydrophobic (extremely water
            resistant) and can keep water from entering the central
            compartment even when the structure is forced to submerge
            under water. <br>
            <br>
            Dr Guo says the 'etching process', which is central to
            creating the water resistant surfaces could be applied to
            any metal or other material. <br>
            <br>
            The team tested the metal by applying pressure to keep it
            under water for increasing periods of time, then testing to
            see if it would still float. <br>
            <br>
            They also tried piercing the surface and found it was still
            able to float as part of the bubble of air would remain
            intact. <br>

            There is an Israeli company in the world news at the moment
            generating Brown's Gas onboard a vehicle, and incredibly,
            they are pushing the idea that instead of using a fossil
            fuel in the vehicle fuel tank (like petrol or diesel) that
            instead put mainly water in the fuel tank mixed with an
            alcohol.&nbsp; The company website is here
            https://www.maymaan.com/&nbsp; (MayMaan is Hebrew for
            Hydrogen).<br>
            <br>
            I researched their patents quickly because I thought they
            must have some magic because the media promotes it as the
            development of a new engine.&nbsp; However, the bottom line
            is they feed Brown's Gas in with the air intake and put
            water in the fuel tank and add some alcohol to it.<br>
            <br>
            What this guys are putting there is that Brown's Gas
            on-board fuel generation is so fantastic it can combust
            mainly water with some alcohol mixed in with it.&nbsp; This
            is an astounding claim...<br>

            <div style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">Brown's
              Gas more than doubles fuel efficiency, according to latest
              research<br>
            </div>
            <br>
            A study published in Applied Thermal Engineering finds that
            Brown's Gas is a silver bullet for modifying the fuel of
            HCCI engines, more than doubling their fuel efficiency and
            eliminating tailpipe emissions. <br>
            <br>
            For the research a series of experiments were conducted
            using homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI)
            engines. HCCI is a form of internal combustion using well
            mixed fuel and air which are compressed to the point of auto
            ignition. <br>
            <br>
            Water electrolysis gas (WEG) or Brown's Gas was added as an
            auxiliary fuel to enhance heating potential of the fuel
            mixture. The addition of Brown's Gas was found to reduce the
            amount of gasoline by 35%-40%. <br>
            <br>
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">More power less gasoline</span><br
              style="font-weight: bold;">
            <br>
            Researchers of the study note that the "...addition of Water
            Electrolysis Gas plays an important role to generate strong
            enough power and efficient operation by the combined effects
            of high heating potential and fast burning velocity".<br>
            <br>
            Brown's Gas is estimated to have 10-20x more power potential
            than liquid gasoline. <br>
            <br>
            According to the research: <br>
            <br>
            "The high engine performance could be explained by the
            combined effects of the high heating potential of WEG, the
            reduced time of reaction by vaporized gasoline and finally
            lean burn application with the excess air."<br>
            <br>
            Brown's Gas more than doubles fuel efficiency, according to
            latest research<br>
            Brown's Gas makes engines cleaner<br>
            <br>
            Since the peak operating temperature were significantly
            lower than spark ignition engines used in most vehicles (100
            C), NOx emissions and particulate were almost negligible.
            Similar experiments were made using three different engines
            such as the Honda GX 160, 270 and Chinese Honda B33.
            Researchers concluded that the addition of Brown's Gas
            showed similar or better engine performance.<br>

            <span style="font-weight: bold;">Abstract</span><br
              style="font-weight: bold;">
            The energy efficiency of internal combustion engine reached
            to about 30% only recently. To increase the efficiency,
            homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) has been
            proposed, however, there is no available commercial engine
            yet. The main problem lies in the delayed heating rate in
            spite of fast reaction of homogeneous charged state of HCCI
            with excess air. To overcome this difficulty, a modification
            of fuel by vaporization of liquid gasoline with water
            electrolysis gas and air was adopted in order to warrant the
            fast and high temperature rise. Experiments were carried out
            with single cylinder engines supplied from the four
            different manufacturers. Experimental results show that fuel
            consumption was decreased by more than 50% compared to the
            case of supplying liquid fuel. It is believed it was due to
            the combined effects of the high and fast heating potential
            of water electrolysis gas together with the efficient
            turbulence mixing effect of vaporized fuel with excess air.
            By this method, the drawbacks caused by lean burn in the
            HCCI engine such as small power range can be overcome.<br>

            <div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight:
                bold;">Why The Thunder Energies’ Directional Neutron
                Source Is A World-Class Innovation? </span><br
                style="font-weight: bold;">
            </div>
            <br>
            The most significant reason of naming The Thunder Energies’
            Directional Neutron Source a World-Class technology is its
            unlikeness with any other neutron sources out there for
            conception, operation and use. The Thunder Energies’
            Directional Neutron Source operates on a completely new
            system, based on new mathematics, physics and chemistry
            (Hadronic Mathematics, Mechanics and Chemistry) verifying
            Einstein’s prediction that “quantum mechanics is not a
            complete theory ” (EPR Argument). Consequently, it’s not
            just an improvement of existing neutron sources but –
            additionally – it’s an entirely, basically new technology.
            Consequently, it’s not just an improvement of existing
            neutron sources but – additionally – Sir Dr. R. M. Santilli
            created an entirely new modern technology. <br>
            <br>
            Studies on the new mathematics physics and chemistry
            verifying Einstein’s prediction were initiated by Sir Dr.
            Ruggero Maria Santilli in the early 1980s at Harvard
            University under DOE support and continued thereafter at
            various international institutions. The synthesis of the
            neutron form the hydrogen is not permitted by quantum
            mechanics because the mass of the neutron is bigger than the
            sum of the masses of the electron and of the proton, and for
            other technical reasons.<br>
            <br>
            Santilli achieved in the 1990s a representation of the
            neutron synthesis via the “completion of quantum mechanics
            into hadronic mechanics;…<br>
            <br>
            completed the experimental verification of the existence of
            the neutron synthesis in the early 2000; and founded Thunder
            Energies Corporation in 2014 for the industrial production
            and sale of equipment synthesizing neutrons from the
            hydrogen as well as for the industrial development of other
            cutting edge new technologies that are solely permitted by
            Einstein’s vision on the “lack of completeness of quantum
            mechanics.<br>
            <br>
            Unlike other neutron sources, which need massive and complex
            particle accelerators, radioactive materials which undergo
            various complex nuclear reactions to produce neutrons, The
            Thunder Energies’ Directional Neutron Source just uses
            common hydrogen (gas) injection through a special DC
            discharge tube. This system is much easier to operate. The
            neutrons emitted through the system carry low energy
            threshold (below 300keV) and the emitted energy is blocked
            (and absorbed) by walls and solid objects. (Santiili, R. M.
            (2019). International Journal of Applied Physics and
            Mathematics (2nd ed., Vol. 9). doi: 10.17706)<br>
            <br>
            Hydrogen-based Directional Neutron Source reactors are
            widely applicable in various daily life activities
            especially in security maintenance, medical/engineering
            imaging, and mining industry. The directionality of the
            neutron flux is a key feature of the device and it has vast
            implications both in the medical industries and industrial
            business enterprise. Moreover, it is much more inexpensive
            than other reactors, neutron sources, and it is easier to
            operate...<br>
            <br>
            The Thunder Energies’ Directional Neutron Source works on a
            completely new technology, based on the latest developments
            in physics known as the Hadronic Mechanics. It’s not just an
            improvement of existing neutron sources – however, it uses
            commercial hydrogen forced through a special DC discharge
            tube. This system is much more advanced, easy to use, and
            doesn’t emit harmful radiation. Moreover, it emits low
            energy Neutrons (below 300 keV) that can be stopped by solid
            objects.<br>
            <br>
            Very simply, the Directional Neutron Source’s energy can be
            controlled by adjusting pressure, position of the electrodes
            and spark voltage. Furthermore, the Directionality of the
            neutron flux can be controlled with an ordinary pump.
            Firstly, it ionizes the hydrogen and then separates
            electrons from the protons without cracking the nucleus. <br>
            <br>
            The Thunder Energies’ Directional Neutron Source also has
            intriguing implications for nuclear physics research, due to
            it’s ability to synthesize the neutron, the negatively
            charged pseudoproton and the negatively charged deuterium!<br>
            <br>
            “According to Santilli conception and industrial
            realization, the Directional Neutron Source synthesizes the
            neutron from from the hydrogen by first ionizing the
            hydrogen into electrons and protons and then compressing the
            electron inside the proton according to Rutherford’s 1910
            conception.”<br>
            <br>
            The pseudoproton is synthesized by compressing an electron
            inside a neutron, so it is basically a negatively charged
            proton (NOT a real antiproton), whose existence has been
            apparently confirmed. These new particles have enormous
            scientific and industrial implications! (Santiili, R. M.
            (2019). International Journal of Applied Physics and
            Mathematics (2nd ed., Vol. 9). doi: 10.17706)<br>
            <br>
            Besides synthesizing neutrons, The Thunder Energies’
            Directional Neutron Source can also synthesize, with smaller
            probability, some other particles which are completely new
            and have enormous scientific and industrial implications.<br>
            <br>
            The importance of the pesudoproton is that, having a
            meanlife of the order of seconds (like the neutron), it
            permits industrial applications, such as the first study of
            nuclear energies without harmful radiations via the new
            transmutation of “light natural, stable elements” into
            “light natural and stable elements with smaller mass”
            negatively charged pseudodeuterium nucleus.<br>
            <br>
            A reason for the lack of achievement of the controlled
            nuclear fusion to date is that nuclei repel each other due
            to their positive charges with an extremely big Coulomb
            force proportional to the inverse of the square of the very
            small distances needed to achieve the fusion. Therefore
            enourmous amounts of energy are required for the two nuclei
            to get physically closer and allow fusion to happen.<br>
            <br>
            The Thunder Energies’ Directional Neutron Source on the
            other end permits the study of the synthesis of “negatively
            charged” nuclei that, in this case, are strongly attracted
            (in lieu of being repelled) by natural nuclei resulting in a
            basically new approach to the controlled fusion.<br>

            The most influential teachers' union in America, the
            far-left National Education Association, celebrated illegal
            immigration and appears to be celebrating violence against
            federal immigration authorities in a “comic book.” The
            radical NEA also smeared supporters of border security on
            its website using the fictional “Super DACA Defenders”
            story. DACA, of course, refers to the illegal (and
            temporary) amnesty from deportation that Obama purported to
            grant to broad categories of illegal immigrants...<br>
            <br>
            There is an&nbsp; English version of the comic book, as well
            as a Chinese version, posted on the NEA website. According
            to the Migration Policy Institute, about one out of five
            children in California's government schools are either
            illegal immigrants or the children of illegal immigrants,
            costing taxpayers in California (and beyond) nearly $20
            billion annually.<br>
            <br>
            The half-baked propaganda, created by Ben Kaibin Xiao, was
            funded by a grant from the NEA "Minority Community
            Organizing and Partnerships." The outfit promotes perversion
            while advocating for open borders and seeking to exploit
            minorities to advance its radical political agenda. It also
            works to facilitate and encourage illegal immigration.
            “Education advocacy and social justice advocacy go hand in
            hand,” the NEA MCOP website says. ..<br>

            ..."We hate you, first and foremost, because you are
            disbelievers; you reject the oneness of Allah – whether you
            realize it or not – by making partners for Him in worship,
            you blaspheme against Him, claiming that He has a son
            [Christ], you fabricate lies against His prophets and
            messengers, and you indulge in all manner of devilish
            practices. It is for this reason that we were commanded to
            openly declare our hatred for you and our enmity towards
            you. “There has already been for you an excellent example in
            Abraham and those with him, when they said to their people,
            ‘Indeed, we are disassociated from you and from whatever you
            worship other than Allah. We have rejected you, and there
            has arisen, between us and you, enmity and hatred forever
            until you believe in Allah alone’” (Al-Mumtahanah 4 [i.e.,
            Koran 60:4]). Furthermore, just as your disbelief is the
            primary reason we hate you, your disbelief is the primary
            reason we fight you, as we have been commanded to fight the
            disbelievers until they submit to the authority of Islam,
            either by becoming Muslims, or by paying jizyah – for those
            afforded this option [“People of the Book”] – and living in
            humiliation under the rule of the Muslims [per Koran
            9:29]...<br>
            <br>
            The fact is, even if you were to stop bombing us,
            imprisoning us, torturing us, vilifying us, and usurping our
            lands, we would continue to hate you because our primary
            reason for hating you will not cease to exist until you
            embrace Islam. Even if you were to pay jizyah and live under
            the authority of Islam in humiliation, we would continue to
            hate you.. <br>

            The truth about the “standard American diet” is that it is a
            diet of chronically consuming that which is bad for you
            while not consuming that which is healthy.&nbsp; One
            ingredient we chronically consume, which we should be rarely
            consuming if at all, is bleached white flour<br>
            <br>
            Did you know that bleached white flour was almost
            outlawed?&nbsp; The Federal District Court of Missouri
            declared it “unfit for human consumption” in 1910.&nbsp;
            H.W. Wiley, in his book “The History of a Crime Against the
            Pure Food Law” discussed the case.&nbsp; In Mr. Wiley’s
            opinion, enforcement of this law was “halted through the
            political influence of the millers” and “no notice of was
            ever sent to the FDA for violations”.<br>
            <br>
            Current manufacturing processes for bleached flour include
            treating wheat with fungicides, pesticides and
            insecticides…basically at every step from the first sprout
            of the wheat to the final packaging.&nbsp; There are
            currently approximately 60 FDA approved chemicals for the
            manufacturing of white flour.<br>
            <br>
            Here are some of the top 5 most shocking facts about
            bleached white flour:<br>
            <br>
            1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are basically
            zero nutrients:&nbsp; You can tell as much about the
            nutritional value of a food by what it doesn’t have just as
            much as you can by what it does have.&nbsp; In the case of
            white flour, it doesn’t have much.&nbsp; Basically, all the
            nutrients (76% of the vitamins, 97% of the fiber and 99% of
            the calcium, iron, magnesium and B vitamins) are removed
            from the wheat during processing.<br>
            <br>
            2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They add Potassium
            Bromate:&nbsp; In addition to bleaching the wheat with
            chlorine dioxide, further whitening is accomplished by
            adding such fillers as chalk, alum and ammonium carbonate
            (this is what gives flour its almost silky smooth
            feel).&nbsp; However, the final stage is most shocking, the
            addition of Potassium Bromate!&nbsp; You see Bromate is
            rated a category 2B carcinogen by the IARC (International
            Agency for Research on Cancer).&nbsp; Which is why the
            ingredient is outlawed in Europe and Canada.&nbsp;
            Unfortunately, it is still an ingredient in American white
            flour.<br>
            <br>
            3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bleached White flour
            is a natural insecticide: Did you know if an insect eats
            flour they will die?&nbsp; Hmmmm.<br>
            <br>
            4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Contains L-cysteine:
            To speed up industrial processing, most baked goods in the
            US have this non-essential amino acid.&nbsp; You can
            certainly expect it in fast food buns, processed pizza
            doughs and cookies.&nbsp; Mostly sourced from chicken
            feathers and cow horns, it usually comes from China where
            regulation is scarcely enforced.<br>
            <br>
            5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Contains Alloxan:
            This makes the bread look fresh and clean.&nbsp;
            Unfortunately, scientific studies have shown it can destroy
            beta cells of the pancreas.&nbsp; This was noted in the “The
            Textbook of Natural Medicine”. <br>

              style="font-weight: bold;">
            Objectives: Various antibacterial and antiplaque agents are
            used in chemical plaque control but none are without their
            shortcomings. Chlorhexidine considered a gold standard, also
            has an array of side effects. To overcome these, numerous
            herbal extracts have been tried and tested and one among
            them is holy basil. The present study evaluated the
            antibacterial efficacy of holy basil in vitro against some
            periodontopathogens and its antiplaque effect in vivo. Study
            Design: Thirty periodontally healthy volunteers were
            randomly divided into three groups and refrained from all
            mechanical oral hygiene measures for 4 days and used one of
            the randomly assigned mouthwash (1- chlorhexidine; 2- holy
            basil; and 3- sterile water [placebo]) twice daily. The
            Plaque Index (PI) was assessed at days 0 and 5. Aqueous
            extract of holy basil was tested against Prevotella
            intermedia (P. intermedia) and Fusobacterium nucleatum
            (F.nucleatum). Results: Holy basil extract showed inhibition
            of both the tested periodontopathogens (P.intermedia and
            F.nucleatum) at various concentrations. In all groups, the
            PI increased from baseline to day 5. There was a
            statistically significant difference (p &lt; .05) between
            the chlorhexidine and placebo rinse and the holy basil and
            placebo rinse, but no statistically significant difference
            was found between the chlorhexidine and holy basil rinse
            with respect to PI. Conclusions: These results indicate that
            the holy basil mouthwash has an antiplaque effect and is
            efficacious against P. intermedia and F. nucleatum strains
            in vitro. Hence holy basil mouthwash may have potential as
            an antiplaque mouthwash with prophylactic benefits. <br>

                Press Freedom</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
            </div>
            <br style="font-weight: bold;">
            Grayzone editor Max Blumenthal, a prominent journalistic
            critic of US policy toward Venezuela,&nbsp; was arrested by
            DC police on Friday, October 25, in connection with a
            protest at the Venezuelan embassy, and held incommunicado.
            But if you rely on corporate media, or even leading “press
            freedom” groups, you haven’t heard about this troubling
            encroachment on freedom of the press.<br>
            <br>
            Blumenthal is a bestselling author whose work has appeared
            in such publications as the New York Times, CJR, The Nation
            and Salon. DC police arrested him at his home on a
            five-month-old arrest warrant, charging him with simple
            assault for his attempt to deliver food to the besieged
            Venezuelan embassy; he was held for two days, and for the
            first 36 hours was not allowed to speak with a lawyer. (In
            an interview with FAIR, Blumenthal noted that keeping
            arrestees—generally poor and African-American—from speaking
            with lawyers or family is par for the course in the DC
            criminal justice system.) As of this writing, there has been
            no mention of Blumenthal’s arrest in outlets like the New
            York Times, Washington Post and Reuters that constantly
            publish Venezuela-related content, or by the big “press
            freedom” NGOs...<br>

            ...“This charge is a 100 percent false, fabricated, bogus,
            untrue, and malicious lie,” Blumenthal declared. “It is
            clearly part of a campaign of political persecution designed
            to silence me and the The Grayzone for our factual
            journalism exposing the deceptions, corruption and violence
            of the far-right Venezuelan opposition.”<br>
            <br>
            The arrest warrant was 5 months old. According to an
            individual familiar with the case, the warrant for
            Blumenthal’s arrest was initially rejected. Strangely, this
            false charge was revived months later without the
            defendant’s knowledge...<br>

            It was supposed to be a day of triumph for Venezuelan
            opposition leader Juan Guaido and his forces in Washington
            DC. In Caracas, the opposition had launched “Operacion
            Libertad,” a coup attempt that promised to flip high level
            figures in the military and Maduro’s inner circle and
            deliver Miraflores Palace to Guaido. And in Washington,
            self-declared ambassador Carlos Vecchio was poised to take
            control of Venezuela’s embassy from Maduro’s
            representatives....<br>

                geomagnetic reversals: Implications to mass extinction</b><br>
              <b>Yong Wei, et al.</b><br>

            <b>Highlights</b><b><br>
            </b>Geomagnetic field reversal substantially weakens the
            protection for the atmosphere.<br>
            Solar wind energizes more oxygen ions to escape when
            geomagnetic field is weakened.<br>
            Oxygen escape may explain the drop of atmospheric level
            during mass extinction.<br>
            The causal relation between reversal and mass extinction
            should be “many-to-one”.<br>
            The simulated oxygen escape rate based on knowledge of Mars
            support our hypothesis.<br>

            ...And those that don’t die from being crushed by falling
            buildings could end up dying from falling glass and debris.
            According to the head guy at FEMA’s headquarters in Bothell,
            there will be “three feet of broken glass” in downtown
            Seattle as a result of the earthquake…<br>
            <br>
            “When the skyscrapers start swaying…well, a lot of them are
            designed to have their windows pop out,” said Matt Caesar at
            the region’s FEMA headquarters in Bothell, Washington.<br>
            <br>
            “There’ll be three feet of broken glass on the roads
            underneath those buildings in downtown Seattle — three feet
            of glass. We don’t even see three feet of snow,” he stated.<br>
            <br>
            So there won’t be any heroes running around like Dwayne
            Johnson pulling people out of collapsed buildings, because
            nobody will be able to travel through the mountains of glass
            and fallen debris.<br>

                behavior of water confined in carbon nanotubes.</i><i><br>
              </i><b>David L. Chandler </b><br>
            </div>
            <br>
            ...a team at MIT has found a completely unexpected set of
            changes: Inside the tiniest of spaces — in carbon nanotubes
            whose inner dimensions are not much bigger than a few water
            molecules — water can freeze solid even at high temperatures
            that would normally set it boiling.<br>
            <br>
            The discovery illustrates how even very familiar materials
            can drastically change their behavior when trapped inside
            structures measured in nanometers, or billionths of a meter.
            And the finding might lead to new applications — such as,
            essentially, ice-filled wires — that take advantage of the
            unique electrical and thermal properties of ice while
            remaining stable at room temperature.<br>
            <br>
            The results are being reported today in the journal Nature
            Nanotechnology, in a paper by Michael Strano, the Carbon P.
            Dubbs Professor in Chemical Engineering at MIT; postdoc
            Kumar Agrawal; and three others.<br>
            <br>
            “If you confine a fluid to a nanocavity, you can actually
            distort its phase behavior,” Strano says, referring to how
            and when the substance changes between solid, liquid, and
            gas phases. Such effects were expected, but the enormous
            magnitude of the change, and its direction (raising rather
            than lowering the freezing point), were a complete surprise:
            In one of the team’s tests, the water solidified at a
            temperature of 105 C or more. (The exact temperature is hard
            to determine, but 105 C was considered the minimum value in
            this test; the actual temperature could have been as high as
            151 C.)<br>
            <br>
            “The effect is much greater than anyone had anticipated,”
            Strano says...<br>

            A new battery could shatter the ceiling of current electric
            vehicle batteries<br>
            Swiss startup Innolith says one charge can power a car for
            up to 600 miles<br>
            The 'wet' lithium-ion battery is powered by a proprietary
            electrolyte solution<br>
            Battery still in development and the firm says it could take
            five years to launch<br>
            <br>
            A startup says it will release a lithium-ion battery capable
            of powering an electric vehicle for up to 600 miles,
            effectively shattering the ceiling of its competitors. <br>
            <br>
            Only time will tell, however, if the company can deliver on
            its promises, as Innolith said it may take another three to
            five years to launch the battery. <br>
            <br>
            The Swiss startup says it has patents pending for the 1,000
            Wh/kg (Watt-hours per kilogram) battery.<br>
            <br>
            At that rate, it nearly triples the endurance of the
            Panasonic produced battery currently used by the Tesla 3. <br>
            <br>
            Elon Musk's electric vehicle technology gives drivers about
            300 miles on one charge. <br>
            <br>
            Innolith's battery is also capable of packing an even bigger
            punch than a battery being developed the U.S. Department of
            Energy, which is targeted for 500 Wh/kg. <br>
            <br>
            'The [electric vehicle] revolution is currently stymied by
            the limitations of available batteries,' said CEO of
            Innolith, Sergey Buchin in a statement.<br>
            <br>
            'Consumers want an adequate range on a single charge in an
            affordable [electric vehicle], and confidence that it is not
            going to catch fire. <br>
            <br>
            'The Innolith Energy Battery is the breakthrough technology
            that potentially can meet all these needs,' he added. <br>
            <br>
            The secret to Innolith's battery, is the use of what the
            company calls a specially designed 'inorganic electrolyte.'
            <br>
            <br>
            The electrolyte, according to a report from The Verge, is
            what one company executive calls 'salt-like materials.' <br>
            <br>
            In addition to providing drivers with a longer charge,
            Innolith says that their technology would also be safer than
            current 'wet' lithium-ion batteries that involve the use of
            volatile chemicals which are prone to fires. <br>
            <br>
            While Innolith's claims are eye-grabbing, the company says
            that its product is still currently 'under development' in
            its Germany lab and said it will take another three to five
            years to bring to production.&nbsp; <br>
            <br>
            What makes the claims more promising than other lab
            announcements of its ilk, however, is that currently one of
            the company's batteries is being tested by power company PJM
            Grid which operates in Delaware, Illinois, Indiana,
            Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, North Carolina,
            Ohio, Pennsylvania, and more.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
            <br>
            The company hopes that the test will help solidify its
            claims and the batteries efficacy as it looks to bring its
            innovation to market.&nbsp; <br>
            <br>
            In a statement the company also said it is looking to start
            producing its batteries in Germany and eventually license
            the technology to other manufacturer and battery companies.<br>

                of range? This startup claims to have done it</b><br>
              Switzerland’s Innolith says it has made a major battery
              breakthrough, but there’s reason to be skeptical<br>
              <b>By Andrew J. Hawkins</b><br>
            </div>
            <br>
            Electric carmakers have long been clamoring for a battery
            breakthrough that will improve the range of their vehicles
            while also extending their lifespans. Innolith, a Swiss
            startup, says its new high-density lithium-ion batteries can
            do just that.<br>
            <br>
            The company claims to have made the world’s first 1,000
            Wh/kg rechargeable battery. (Watt-hours per kilogram is a
            unit of measurement commonly used to describe the density of
            energy in batteries.) By comparison, the batteries that
            Tesla uses in its Model 3 — the so-called 2170 cells — are
            an estimated 250 Wh/kg; the company plans to eventually push
            that to 330 Wh/kg. Meanwhile, the US Department of Energy is
            funding a program to create 500 Wh/kg battery cells. If
            Innolith’s claims turn out to be true, its high-density
            battery may have just leap-frogged over those targets.<br>
            <br>
            <b>"“It’s a big jump”"</b><b><br>
            </b><br>
            “It’s a big jump,” Innolith chairman Alan Greenshields said
            in an interview with The Verge. “It’s basically, in rough
            numbers, four times the current state-of-the-art for
            lithium-ion... Roughly three times what is generally
            accepted as being the next improvement in lithium. And it’s
            two times the energy density target [that] organizations
            like the US Department of Energy have set. So this is a big
            deal.”...<br>
            <br>
            A battery with that density would be capable of powering an
            electric car for 1,000 kilometers (621 miles) on a single
            charge. That’s far greater than the current lithium-ion
            batteries on the market today. Tesla’s batteries, which are
            produced by Panasonic, can support 330 miles of range in the
            most expensive models. Most major automakers are aiming for
            a similar range in their electric vehicles. <br>
            <br>
            Innolith still uses “wet” liquid electrolytes in its
            lithium-ion batteries, but there’s one major difference: the
            company replaces the organic (and highly flammable) solvent
            containing the electrolytes with an inorganic substance
            that’s more stable and less flammable.<br>
            <br>
            “We take the organic materials out and replace them with
            inorganic or basically salt-like materials, and that does
            two things for you,” Greenshields says. “One is it gets rid
            of your fire risk, so, of course, there’s nothing to burn.
            And the second part is you’ve also got rid of the most
            reactive components in the system, which makes it easier to
            build a battery where you can pack in a lot of energy
            without the thing becoming unstable.” <br>
            <br>
            The organic materials found in most lithium-ion batteries
            are the “principle source of side reactions,” which, over
            time, can consume the active materials in the battery and
            turn the whole closed-loop system into something
            “non-productive,” he adds. Innolith claims its new battery
            has done away with this problem. ...<br>

            of the sulfur dioxide, is less than 6 mMol per Ah
            theoretical capacity of the cell. The amount of oxygen
            compounds, which are contained in the positive electrode and
            react with sulfur dioxide under the reduction of the sulfur
            dioxide, is less than 8 mMol per Ah theoretical capacity of

            contained in the electrolyte and react with sulfur dioxide
            under the reduction of the sulfur dioxide, is less than 10
            mMol per Ah theoretical capacity of the cell. A

            oxidation step of maximum +III that is thiosulfate of the
            active metal of the cell, is formed as reaction product of
            the reaction, by which the sulfur dioxide is reduced. The
            sulfur-oxygen-compound, in which the oxidation step of the
            sulfur +IV is chlorosulfonate of the active metal of the
            cell, additionally contains halogen and is formed as
            reaction product of the reaction, by which the sulfur
            dioxide is reduced during over-loading the cell. The
            electrolyte per Ah theoretical capacity of the cell contains
            less than 10 mMol of sulfur dioxide. The active material
            consists of alkali metals, earth alkali metals and metals of
            second sub-group of the periodic system. The negative
            electrode is an insertion electrode and contains carbon. The
            positive electrode contains an intercalation compound. The
            concentration of conducting salt in the electrolyte is 5
            mol/l. The battery cell includes a separator, which
            separates the negative electrode and the positive electrode
            from each other and penetrates the passage of metallic
            lithium deposited on the negative electrode to a surface of
            the positive electrode, and an insulator, which electrically
            separates the negative electrode from the positive
            electrode, where the insulator is designed, so that the
            active metal deposited on the negative electrode contacts
            with the positive electrode during loading the cell such
            that the locally limited short-circuit reactions occur on
            the surface of the positive electrode.<br>

            <br>
            Is it possible to borrow energy from an empty space? And if
            yes, do we have to give it back? Energy values smaller than
            zero are allowed - at least within certain limits.<br>
            <br>
            Vacuum is more complicated than we might think - according
            to quantum physics.<br>
            <br>
            Energy is a quantity that must always be positive - at least
            that's what our intuition tells us. If every single particle
            is removed from a certain volume until there is nothing left
            that could possibly carry energy, then a limit has been
            reached. Or has it? Is it still possible to extract energy
            even from empty space?<br>
            <br>
            Quantum physics has shown time and again that it contradicts
            our intuition – and this is also true in this case. Under
            certain conditions negative energies are allowed, at least
            in a certain range of space and time. An international
            research team at the TU Vienna, the Université libre de
            Bruxelles (Belgium) and the IIT Kanpur (India) have now
            investigated the extent to which negative energy is
            possible. It turns out that no matter which quantum theories
            are considered, no matter what symmetries are assumed to
            hold in the universe, there are always certain limits to
            "borrowing" energy. Locally, the energy can be less than
            zero, but like money borrowed from a bank, this energy must
            be “paid back” in the end....<br>
            <br>
            The so-called "Quantum Null Energy Condition" (QNEC), which
            was proven in 2017, prescribes certain limits for the
            "borrowing" of energy by linking relativity theory and
            quantum physics: An energy smaller than zero is thus
            permitted, but only in a certain range and only for a
            certain time. How much energy can be borrowed from a vacuum
            before the energetic credit limit has been exhausted depends
            on a quantum physical quantity, the so-called entanglement
            entropy....<br>

            <b>Abstract</b><b><br>
            </b>The vanishingly small response of matter to light above
            ultraviolet frequencies makes the manipulation of light
            emission at such frequencies challenging. As a result,
            state-of-the-art sources of high-frequency light are
            typically active, relying on strong external electromagnetic
            fields. Here, we present a fundamental mechanism of light
            emission that is fully passive, relying instead on vacuum
            fluctuations near nanophotonic structures. This mechanism
            can be used to generate light at any frequency, including
            high-frequency radiation such as X-rays. The proposed
            mechanism is equivalent to a quantum optical two-photon
            process, in which a free electron spontaneously emits a
            low-energy polariton and a high-energy photon
            simultaneously. Although two-photon processes are nominally
            weak, we find that the resulting X-ray radiation can be
            substantial. The strength of this process is related to the
            strong Casimir–Polder forces that atoms experience in the
            nanometre vicinity of materials, with the essential
            difference being that the fluctuating force here acts on a
            free electron, rather than a neutral, polarizable atom. The
            light emission can be shaped by controlling the nanophotonic
            geometry or the underlying material electromagnetic response
            at optical or infrared frequencies. Our results reveal ways
            of applying the tools of nanophotonics even at frequencies
            where materials have an insubstantial electromagnetic
            response. The process we study, when scaled up, may also
            enable new concepts for compact and tunable X-ray radiation.<br>

            <br>
            Nuclear technology companies Phoenix and SHINE Medical
            Technologies have achieved a new world record for a nuclear
            fusion reaction in a steady-state system, the strongest of
            its kind ever produced on Earth. The reaction yielded 46
            trillion (4.6×1013) neutrons per second, eclipsing the
            previous record by nearly 25% and setting a new standard for
            neutron generator technology.<br>
            <br>
            This breakthrough could prove great news for the field of
            nuclear medicine. SHINE was founded in 2010 to create a
            safe, cost-effective and environmentally-friendly technology
            to produce medical isotopes. And it’s using Phoenix’s
            high-flux neutron generators to achieve this.<br>
            <br>
            In particular, the companies aim to resolve the ongoing
            global supply issues of molybdenum-99 (Mo-99), a
            radioisotope that decays into the diagnostic imaging agent
            technetium-99m (Tc-99m). The most prevalent nuclear medicine
            agent, Tc-99m is employed in tens of millions of medical
            diagnostic procedures each year, primarily in stress tests
            to diagnose heart disease or to stage cancer.<br>
            <br>
            Mo-99, however, is currently generated using a handful of
            ageing nuclear reactors, shutdowns of which have led to
            serious supply shortages in the past. SHINE plans to replace
            the nuclear reactor with Phoenix’s low-energy,
            accelerator-based neutron generator.<br>
            <br>
            The Phoenix system works by accelerating positively-charged
            deuterium ions into a target of tritium gas to induce a
            fusion reaction. This reaction results in the production of
            high-energy neutrons and helium. These neutrons then pass
            into a tank and strike their target: low-enriched uranium
            (LEU) dissolved in an aqueous solution. This causes the
            uranium nuclei to split and create multiple elements,
            including Mo-99 and other useful isotopes.<br>
            <br>
            As well as eliminating the need for nuclear reactor
            facilities, the technology’s use of LEU (containing less
            than 20% U-235) confers a major security advantage. Until
            recently, most Mo-99 production used targets of
            weapons-grade highly-enriched uranium (HEU), which contains
            20% or more U-235. LEU, however, cannot be used to create
            nuclear weapons weaponized without highly sophisticated
            modifications and is thus considered far less of a risk....<br>

                immunosenescent trends in humans</b><br>
              <b>Gregory M. Fahy, et al.</b><br>
            </div>
            <b><br>
            </b><b>Abstract</b><b><br>
            </b>Epigenetic “clocks” can now surpass chronological age in
            accuracy for estimating biological age. Here, we use four
            such age estimators to show that epigenetic aging can be
            reversed in humans. Using a protocol intended to regenerate
            the thymus, we observed protective immunological changes,
            improved risk indices for many age&#8208;related diseases, and a
            mean epigenetic age approximately 1.5 years less than
            baseline after 1 year of treatment (&#8722;2.5&#8208;year change
            compared to no treatment at the end of the study). The rate
            of epigenetic aging reversal relative to chronological age
            accelerated from &#8722;1.6 year/year from 0–9 month to &#8722;6.5
            year/year from 9–12 month. The GrimAge predictor of human
            morbidity and mortality showed a 2&#8208;year decrease in
            epigenetic vs. chronological age that persisted six months
            after discontinuing treatment. This is to our knowledge the
            first report of an increase, based on an epigenetic age
            estimator, in predicted human lifespan by means of a
            currently accessible aging intervention...<br>
            <br>
            ...we combined rhGH with both dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA)
            and metformin in an attempt to limit the “diabetogenic”
            effect of GH..<br>
            <br>
            In this regard, it must be pointed out that GH and IGF&#8208;1 can
            also have pro&#8208;aging effects and that most gerontologists
            therefore favor reducing rather than increasing the levels
            of these factors (Longo et al., 2015). However, most past
            studies of aging and GH/IGF&#8208;1 are confounded by the use of
            mutations that affect the developmental programming of
            aging, which is not necessarily relevant to nonmutant
            adults. For example, such mutations in mice alter the normal
            innervation of the hypothalamus during brain development and
            prevent the hypothalamic inflammation in the adult
            (Sadagurski et al., 2015). Hypothalamic inflammation may
            program adult body&#8208;wide aging in nonmutants (Zhang et al.,
            2017), but it seems unlikely that lowering IGF&#8208;1 in normal
            non&#8208;mutant adults can provide the same protection. A second
            problem with past studies is a general failure to uncouple
            GH/IGF&#8208;1 signaling from lifelong changes in insulin
            signaling. Human longevity seems more consistently linked to
            insulin sensitivity than to IGF&#8208;1 levels, and the effects of
            IGF&#8208;1 on human longevity are confounded by its inverse
            proportionality to insulin sensitivity (Vitale, Pellegrino,
            Vollery, &amp; Hofland, 2019). We therefore believe our
            approach of increasing GH/IGF&#8208;1 for a limited time in the
            more natural context of elevated DHEA while maximizing
            insulin sensitivity is justified, particularly in view of
            the positive role of GH and IGF&#8208;1 in immune maintenance, the
            role of immune maintenance in the retardation of aging
            (Fabris et al., 1988), and our present results. <br>
            <br>
            Whatever the mechanism of epigenetic age reversal may be,
            the four selected epigenetic clocks, despite measuring
            somewhat different features of aging and correlating
            differently with blood composition and leukocyte telomere
            length, all showed significant regression of epigenetic age.
            There was also a marked acceleration of epigenetic aging
            reversal after 9 months of treatment. The implications of
            the latter observation remain to be explored... <br>

            Julian Assange is reported to very thin, very sick and being
            treated at this point, as little more than a “lab rat” by
            his state doctors and interrogators at Belmarsh.&nbsp; Word
            is that his encryption key ring (with his private keys that
            unlock his various public keys) has already been extracted,
            under physical duress, cold, light and noise torture, food
            deprivation, BZ variants, some experimental, and now that he
            is very physically weak, PCP.&nbsp; The arrests have started
            and they won’t stop until the injured parties –mainly the US
            government – have satisfied their bloodlust.<br>
