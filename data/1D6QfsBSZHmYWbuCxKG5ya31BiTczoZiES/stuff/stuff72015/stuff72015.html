      </div>
      <b> </b><br>
      A simple-to-make "superlens" can focus 10 times more sharply than
      a conventional lens. It could shrink the size of features on
      computer chips, or help power gadgets without wires. No matter how
      powerful a conventional lens, it cannot focus light down to more
      than about half its wavelength, the "diffraction limit". This
      limits the amount of data that can be stored on a CD, and the size
      of features on computer chips. The new lens is a
      127-micrometer-thick plate of teflon and ceramic with a copper
      topping. "The beauty of these is that they're planar," Grbic says,
      "they're easy to fabricate." The lenses can be made through a
      single step of photolithography, the process used to etch computer
      chips. By selectively etching away the copper, Grbic and
      colleagues created many capacitors sandwiched together. Capacitors
      are typically used in electronics for storing electric charge for
      short periods. In the lens, the capacitors instead interact
      directly with electromagnetic waves like light. This sets up
      currents in the capacitors that focus the waves passing through
      the lens into a point 20 times smaller than their wavelength. That
      is 10 times tighter than a conventional lens can achieve, hampered
      by the diffraction limit. The team's current prototype works on
      microwaves, which are easier to focus because they have longer
      wavelengths than visible light. Simply making capacitors of
      different sizes would allow the lens to focus other frequencies,
      including visible and infrared light, says Grbic.<br>

      Planar sub-wavelength structures provide superlensing, i.e.,
      electromagnetic focusing beyond the diffraction limit. The planar
      structures use diffraction to force the input field to converge to
      a spot on the focal plane. The sub-wavelength patterned structures
      manipulate the output wave in such a manner as to form a
      sub-wavelength focus in the near field. In some examples, the
      sub-wavelength structures may be linear grating-like structures
      that can focus electromagnetic radiation to lines of arbitrarily
      small sub-wavelength dimension, or two dimensional grating-like
      structures and Bessel (azimuthally symmetric) structures that can
      focus to spots of arbitrarily small sub-wavelength dimensions. The
      particular pattern for the sub-wavelength structures may be
      derived from the desired focus. Some examples describe
      sub-wavelength structures that have been implemented to focus
      microwave radiation to sub-wavelength dimensions in the near
      field.<br>

      <br>
      I don’t have any other information on this product but it sounds
      fascinating!<br>
      <br>
      “Neeroga is a unique formulation which can easily root out all
      ailments caused by toxins and various viruses. It was developed
      after seven years of dedicated research by Dr GR Saini and his
      team at the Saini Herbal Research &amp; Development Center. It is
      a modern ‘Sanjivani’ (life giver) by using which old people become
      young and young become younger. This product complies with the
      basic Ayurvedic concept of keeping healthy persons fit and
      bringing relief to the diseased. It has been tried by several
      people ranging in age from15 years to 94 years and the results
      have been nothing short of amazing. Ailments related to vital
      organs viz kidney, liver, heart, brain and lungs were found to be
      cured by this medicine and it also strengthened the body’s immune
      system. This wonder drug called ‘Neeroga’ helps people to live a
      healthy life and to live up to hundred. Such a composition has
      been mentioned even in ancient Ayurvedic texts. Apart from giving
      a younger, glowing and fairer skin, this drug can help to cure
      many diseases such as diabetes, stroke, cardiac ailments, liver
      disorders, respiratory stress, and many other ailments. Another
      remarkable result of the trial of this drug was that the patient
      remains cured and healthy even when the dosage is discontinued
      after treatment. This medicine has worked wonders on people. Even
      octogenarians who were unable to walk or see could actually run.
      They became fitter in many ways. Their cholesterol levels, blood
      sugar levels etc jumped back to normal and they stopped taking
      allopathic medicines. Problems of breathlessness and other
      respiratory ailments can also be treated with the help of this
      medicine. People having a count of 42 breaths per minute were
      treated with the help of this medicine and their count went down
      to 25 breaths per minute after about a month of treatment. Within
      24 hours of administering the medicine, the breathing count
      reduces by 1 to 6 per minute. Dr GR Saini says, “With the
      introduction of Neeroga my dream of presenting a herbal
      composition which should be easy to administer, simple, quick and
      effective in curing all diseases without any side effects is now
      fulfilled.”<br>

      <br>
      Robert Sutton Harrington (October 21, 1942 – January 23, 1993) was
      an American astronomer who worked at the United States Naval
      Observatory (USNO). Harrington was born near Newport News,
      Virginia. His father was an archaeologist. He was married to
      Betty-Jean Maycock in 1976, with two daughters, Amy and Ann.[1]<br>
      <br>
      Harrington worked at the USNO. Another astronomer there, James W.
      Christy, consulted with him after discovering bulges in the images
      of Pluto, which turned out to be Pluto's satellite Charon.[1] For
      this reason, some consider Harrington to be a co-discoverer of
      Charon,[2] although Christy usually gets sole credit. By the laws
      of physics, it is easy to determine the mass of a binary system
      based on its orbital period, so Harrington was the first to
      calculate the mass of the Pluto-Charon system, which was lower
      than even the lowest previous estimates of Pluto's mass.<br>
      <br>
      Harrington became a believer in the existence of a Planet X beyond
      Pluto and undertook searches for it, with positive results coming
      from the IRAD probe in 1983. Harrington collaborated initially
      with T. C. (Tom) Van Flandern.[1] They were both "courted" by
      Zecharia Sitchin and his followers who believe in a planet Nibiru
      or Marduk, who cite the research of Harrington and van Flandern as
      possible collaborating evidence, though no definitive proof of a
      9th planet has surfaced to date.<br>
      <br>
      Harrington died of esophageal cancer in 1993.[1] The asteroid 3216
      Harrington was named in his honour.<br>

      A local dentist says he has created an orthodontic appliance that
      can straighten an adult's teeth and reverse the effects of aging
      by remodeling an individual's jaw bones. Catskill dentist Theodore
      Belfor said the benefits of his Homeoblock Appliance include
      broader smiles, fuller lips, more prominent cheekbones and a
      brighter, more youthful appearance around an individual's eyes. It
      also helps straighten teeth and can help eliminate snoring and
      sleep apnea, he said. "There are no negative side-effects," Belfor
      said of the appliance. appliance stimulates the development of a
      person's jaws where that development was incomplete causing the
      teeth to become crowded in the mouth. The appliance is worn at
      night and works with the body so the changes occur naturally,
      developing the bones of the face, he said. Belfor said the changes
      that occur are based on each person's genetic potential. Often,
      facial development does not reach its full potential as an
      individual grows because of the food a person eats, lack of
      breast-feeding as an infant or polluted air, among other causes,
      he said. Belfor said the Homeoblock helps reverse the sign of
      aging because as the appliance develops the bones of the face it
      increases the volume and support of the soft tissue, which reduces
      lines and wrinkles on the face. The Homeoblock, according to
      information provided by Belfor, does not work like a typical
      orthodontic appliance wherein mechanical pressure forces the teeth
      and bones of the dental arches apart. The acrylic of the
      Homeoblock Appliance does not actually touch the soft tissue in a
      person's mouth. Instead, the device creates a bellows-like action
      on an individual's dental arches, causing them to widen. Each week
      the patient turns an expansion screw on the appliance to keep up
      with the widening of the bones of the dental arches. As the dental
      arches expand, the teeth have more room in the mouth and can
      straighten out. For additional information on the Homeoblock

      <b>Abstract</b><br>
      <br>
      Age-associated accumulation of somatic mutations in mitochondrial
      DNA (mtDNA) has been proposed to be responsible for the
      age-associated mitochondrial respiration defects found in elderly
      human subjects. We carried out reprogramming of human fibroblast
      lines derived from elderly subjects by generating their induced
      pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), and examined another possibility,
      namely that these aging phenotypes are controlled not by mutations
      but by epigenetic regulation. Here, we show that reprogramming of
      elderly fibroblasts restores age-associated mitochondrial
      respiration defects, indicating that these aging phenotypes are
      reversible and are similar to differentiation phenotypes in that
      both are controlled by epigenetic regulation, not by mutations in
      either the nuclear or the mitochondrial genome. Microarray
      screening revealed that epigenetic downregulation of the
      nuclear-coded GCAT gene, which is involved in glycine production
      in mitochondria, is partly responsible for these aging phenotypes.
      Treatment of elderly fibroblasts with glycine effectively
      prevented the expression of these aging phenotypes.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Introduction</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The mitochondrial theory of aging proposes that age-associated
      overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the resultant
      accumulation of somatic mutations in mtDNA are responsible for
      aging phenotypes including age-associated mitochondrial
      respiration defects1, 2, 3, 4, 5. This concept is supported
      partially by subsequent findings that mtDNA mutator mice
      expressing a proofreading-deficient mtDNA polymerase show
      accelerated accumulation of somatic mutations in mtDNA, resulting
      in the expression of mitochondrial respiration defects and
      premature aging phenotypes6, 7, 8. In contrasts, our previous
      studies proposed that the age-associated respiration defects found
      in human fibroblasts are caused not by mtDNA mutations9, 10, 11
      but by nuclear-recessive mutations11. However, these findings can
      also be explained by assuming the involvement of epigenetic
      regulation of nuclear genes in the absence of nuclear-recessive
      mutations. Here, we addressed these controversial issues by
      reprogramming fibroblasts derived from elderly human subjects and
      examining whether age-associated mitochondrial respiration defects
      could be restored after the reprogramming....<br>
      <br>
      <b>Discussion</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      We reprogrammed human fibroblast lines by generating iPSCs, and
      showed that the reprogramming of fibroblasts derived from elderly
      subjects restored age-associated respiration defects. Therefore,
      these age-associated phenotypes found in elderly fibroblasts are
      regulated reversibly and are similar to differentiation phenotypes
      in that both are controlled by epigenetic regulation, not by
      mutations in either nuclear or mtDNA. Given that human aging can
      be seen as a consequence of a programmed phenomenon, it is
      possible that epigenetic regulation also controls human aging.
      However, further studies are required to generalize the concept
      that human aging and age-associated disorders—in the same way as
      the respiration defects found in elderly fibroblasts—are expressed
      under the control of epigenetic regulation.<br>
      <br>
      We also showed that age-associated mitochondrial respiration
      defects (Fig. 1a) were expressed in the absence of either ROS
      overproduction in the mitochondria (Fig. 1b) or the accumulation
      of somatic mutations in mtDNA (Fig. 1c). One explanation for the
      absence of an age-associated increase in somatic mutations in
      mtDNA (Fig. 1c) is the presence of a dynamic balance between the
      creation and segregation of somatic mutations in mtDNA during
      repeated cell division. This absence could also be a consequence
      of the preferential growth of cells possessing mtDNA without
      somatic mutations during repeated division of the primary
      fibroblasts obtained by biopsy. Here, however, our focus was on
      the causes of respiration defects expressed in elderly human
      fibroblast lines (Fig. 1a), and respiration defects were still
      expressed even after repeated divisions of cells from the primary
      biopsy samples. It is therefore likely that these age-associated
      respiration defects are caused neither by ROS overproduction nor
      by the accumulation of somatic mutations in mtDNA. Furthermore,
      even when somatic mutations accumulate in the mtDNA, consequent
      mitochondrial respiration defects would still be prevented by the
      exchange of genetic products throughout the mitochondria within a
      cell19, 20, 21, 22. The question that then arises is: What causes
      age-associated mitochondrial respiration defects by epigenetic
      regulation?<br>
      <br>
      Our findings revealed that epigenetic downregulation of
      nuclear-coded genes, including GCAT and SHMT2, which regulate
      glycine production in mitochondria17, 18, results in respiration
      defects. Our previous studies showed that the age-associated
      respiration defects in elderly fibroblasts10 are likely due in
      part to reduced translation activity in the mitochondria, but not
      in the cytoplasm11. Therefore, defects in glycine metabolism in
      the mitochondria as a result of a reduction in SHMT2 and GCAT
      expression would be partly responsible for the reduction in
      mitochondrial translation, resulting in the expression of
      age-associated respiration defects. Because continuous glycine
      treatment restored respiration defects in elderly human
      fibroblasts (Supplementary Fig. 6), glycine supplementation may be
      effective in preventing age-associated respiration defects and
      thus benefiting the health of elderly human subjects. To confirm
      this hypothesis model mice deficient in GCAT or SHMT2, or both,
      would need to be generated to examine whether they expressed
      respiration defects and premature aging phenotypes and, if so,
      whether these disorders could be prevented by continuous glycine
      administration.<br>
      <br>
      Recently, abnormalities of autophagy were proposed to be involved
      in the dysfunction of organelles, including mitochondria23. We
      showed that no genes were selected from our microarray analysis by
      using the GO terms, aging and autophagy (Supplementary Fig. 4a),
      and that no morphological abnormalities developed in the
      mitochondria of elderly fibroblasts (Supplementary Fig 1b).
      However, further work is required to examine whether
      age-associated abnormalities of autophagy in the mitochondria are
      in fact involved in the expression of age-associated respiration
      defects and are under the control of epigenetic regulation.<br>

      </div>
      <br>
      Can the process of aging be delayed or even reversed? Research led
      by specially appointed Professor Jun-Ichi Hayashi from the
      University of Tsukuba in Japan has shown that, in human cell lines
      at least, it can. They also found that the regulation of two genes
      involved with the production of glycine, the smallest and simplest
      amino acid, is partly responsible for some of the characteristics
      of aging.<br>
      <br>
      Professor Hayashi and his team made this exciting discovery while
      in the process of addressing some controversial issues surrounding
      a popular theory of aging.<br>
      <br>
      This theory, the mitochondrial theory of aging, proposes that
      age-associated mitochondrial defects are controlled by the
      accumulation of mutations in the mitochondrial DNA. <br>
      <br>
      Abnormal mitochondrial function is one of the hallmarks of aging
      in many species, including humans. This is mostly due to the fact
      that the mitochondrion is the so-called powerhouse of the cell as
      it produces energy in a process called cellular respiration.
      Damage to the mitochondrial DNA results in changes or mutations in
      the DNA sequence. Accumulation of these changes is associated with
      a reduced lifespan and early onset of aging-related
      characteristics such as weight and hair loss, curvature of the
      spine and osteoporosis.<br>
      <br>
      There is, however, a growing body of conflicting evidence that has
      raised doubts about the validity of this theory. The Tsukuba team
      in particular has performed some compelling research that has led
      them to propose that age-associated mitochondrial defects are not
      controlled by the accumulation of mutations in the mitochondrial
      DNA but by another form of genetic regulation. The research,
      published this month in the prestigious journal Nature’s
      ‘Scientific Reports’, looked at the function of the mitochondria
      in human fibroblast cell lines derived from young people (ranging
      in age from a fetus to a 12 year old) and elderly people (ranging
      in age from 80-97 years old). The researchers compared the
      mitochondrial respiration and the amount of DNA damage in the
      mitochondria of the two groups, expecting respiration to be
      reduced and DNA damage to be increased in the cells from the
      elderly group. While the elderly group had reduced respiration, in
      accordance with the current theory, there was, however, no
      difference in the amount of DNA damage between the elderly and
      young groups of cells. This led the researchers to propose that
      another form of genetic regulation, epigenetic regulation, may be
      responsible for the age-associated effects seen in the
      mitochondria.<br>
      <br>
      Epigenetic regulation refers to changes, such as the addition of
      chemical structures or proteins, which alter the physical
      structure of the DNA, resulting in genes turning on or off.<br>
      <br>
      Unlike mutations, these changes do not affect the DNA sequence
      itself. If this theory is correct, then genetically reprogramming
      the cells to an embryonic stem cell–like state would remove any
      epigenetic changes associated with the mitochondrial DNA. In order
      to test this theory, the researchers reprogrammed human fibroblast
      cell lines derived from young and elderly people to an embryonic
      stem cell-like state. These cells were then turned back into
      fibroblasts and their mitochondrial respiratory function examined.
      Incredibly, the age-associated defects had been reversed - all of
      the fibroblasts had respiration rates comparable to those of the
      fetal fibroblast cell line, irrespective of whether they were
      derived from young or elderly people. This indicates that the
      aging process in the mitochondrion is controlled by epigenetic
      regulation, not by mutations.<br>
      <br>
      The researchers then looked for genes that might be controlled
      epigenetically resulting in these age-associated mitochondrial
      defects. Two genes that regulate glycine production in
      mitochondria, CGAT and SHMT2, were found. The researchers showed
      that by changing the regulation of these genes, they could induce
      defects or restore mitochondrial function in the fibroblast cell
      lines. In a compelling finding, the addition of glycine for 10
      days to the culture medium of the 97 year old fibroblast cell line
      restored its respiratory function. This suggests that glycine
      treatment can reverse the age-associated respiration defects in
      the elderly human fibroblasts.<br>
      <br>
      These findings reveal that, contrary to the mitochondrial theory
      of aging, epigenetic regulation controls age-associated
      respiration defects in human fibroblast cell lines. Can epigenetic
      regulation also control aging in humans? That theory remains to be
      tested, and if proven, could result in glycine supplements giving
      our older population a new lease of life.<br>

      <br>
      A pill that's been used for decades could be the fountain of
      youth—and scientists are hoping to test it this year. Quartz
      reports that a drug called metformin could slow the aging process
      and keep people healthier, longer.<br>
      <br>
      Metformin, a drug that currently is used to treat type 2 diabetes,
      increases your sensitivity to insulin by making your liver produce
      less glucose. It's been used safely on diabetes patients for more
      than 60 years. But scientists have tested the drug on animals like
      worms and mice and found that it also increases life spans and
      delays the onset of other diseases.<br>
      <br>
      A group of scientists are set to meet with the Food and Drug
      Administration to push for a clinical trial. If they get
      permission, the researchers will give a drug called metformin to
      about 3,000 elderly people who either suffer from or have a high
      risk for diseases like cancer, heart disease, or cognitive
      problems. They'll then track these participants to see if the drug
      prevents aging-related diseases they don't already have, prevents
      diabetes and lengthens their life spans. <br>

      And rapalogs are not the only game in town. The most commonly used
      medicine for type 2 diabetes, metformin, also seems to extend the
      lifespan of many small animals, including mice, by around 5 per
      cent.<br>
      <br>
      There have been no trials of metformin as a longevity drug in
      people, but a recent study hinted that it might have a similar
      effect. The study was designed to compare metformin with another
      diabetes medicine, using records of 180,000 UK patients. To tease
      out the differences between the drugs, people who started taking
      them were compared with people without diabetes who had been
      closely matched for age and other health factors, and tracked over
      five years..<br>
      <br>
      Surprisingly, diabetics taking metformin were not only less likely
      to die in that time than those on the other medicine but they were
      also about 15 per cent less likely to die than people without
      diabetes who took neither drug. "This shows we already have a drug
      that we can potentially use in humans," says Nir Barzilai, who
      heads the Institute for Aging Research at the Albert Einstein
      College of Medicine in New York.<br>

          mitohormesis via the peroxiredoxin PRDX-2</b><br>
        <br>
        <b>Wouter De Haesa, et al.</b><br>
      </div>
      <b>Significance</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Recently it has been suggested that metformin, the most commonly
      used antidiabetic drug, might also possess general
      health-promoting properties. Elucidating metformin’s mode of
      action will vastly increase its application range and will
      contribute to healthy aging. We reveal a signaling cascade in
      which metformin is able to extend lifespan by increasing the
      production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). This allowed us to
      further work at the crossroads of human disease and aging
      research, identifying a key molecule that is able to translate the
      ROS signal into a prolongevity cue: an antioxidant peroxiredoxin
      is also able to activate a lifespan-promoting signaling cascade,
      here described in detail. Continued research efforts in this field
      lead toward a targeted improvement of aging-related complications.<br>
      <br>
      The antiglycemic drug metformin, widely prescribed as first-line
      treatment of type II diabetes mellitus, has lifespan-extending
      properties. Precisely how this is achieved remains unclear. Via a
      quantitative proteomics approach using the model organism
      Caenorhabditis elegans, we gained molecular understanding of the
      physiological changes elicited by metformin exposure, including
      changes in branched-chain amino acid catabolism and cuticle
      maintenance. We show that metformin extends lifespan through the
      process of mitohormesis and propose a signaling cascade in which
      metformin-induced production of reactive oxygen species increases
      overall life expectancy. We further address an important issue in
      aging research, wherein so far, the key molecular link that
      translates the reactive oxygen species signal into a prolongevity
      cue remained elusive. We show that this beneficial signal of the
      mitohormetic pathway is propagated by the peroxiredoxin PRDX-2.
      Because of its evolutionary conservation, peroxiredoxin signaling
      might underlie a general principle of prolongevity signaling.<br>
      <br>
      Metformin, an antiglycemic biguanide drug and the most common
      treatment of type II diabetes mellitus, has life-extending
      capabilities (1, 2). Several other human diseases, such as cancer
      (3) and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (4), are also potentially
      alleviated by metformin treatment. This suggests that metformin
      acts on common pathways involved in a spectrum of aging-related
      disorders. Because of its demonstrated beneficial effect on
      lifespan in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (5, 6) and in the
      rodents Rattus norvegicus (1) and Mus musculus (2), these models
      facilitate research into the underlying mode of action.<br>
      <br>
      It has been hypothesized that metformin elicits its beneficial
      effects by mimicking dietary restriction (DR) (7), a regimen
      wherein a physiological response is triggered by reducing the
      uptake of nutritive calories. The physiological response to DR
      causes lifespan extension and delays age-dependent decline from
      yeast to primates (8). The idea of similarity sprouts from the
      observed low blood glucose and insulin levels combined with
      increased glucose utilization in both calorically restricted and
      metformin-treated animals (7). In addition, metformin-treated
      worms show phenotypes similar to DR worms (5), and transcript
      profiles of metformin-treated and DR mice also overlap
      significantly (9).<br>
      <br>
      Caution is due, however, in referring to DR, because different
      methods to induce DR in C. elegans act through different genes to
      elicit corresponding effects on lifespan (10?–12). Glucose
      restriction, a specific type of DR, requires AMP-dependent kinase
      (AMPK) to extend lifespan. Activation of AMPK leads to increased
      mitochondrial production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which
      induces stress defense and results in a net increase in longevity.
      This process of lifespan extension based on mitochondrial
      oxidative stress is known as mitohormesis (13). <br>
      <br>
      Despite its similarities to DR and its widespread use as an
      antiglycemic drug, the actual mode of action of metformin is
      largely unknown and a subject of much debate. In mammals,
      metformin is generally believed to act through the activation of
      AMPK, one of the main regulators of cellular energy homeostasis
      (2, 14?–16), but recent research suggests the existence of
      AMPK-independent mechanisms as well (17, 18). More upstream,
      metformin is thought to activate AMPK through partial inhibition
      of complex I of the electron transport chain (ETC) and a resultant
      increase in the AMP/ATP ratio (19?–21), although again, not all
      data support this theory (16, 22). Important players in
      metformin-induced lifespan extension in C. elegans are the liver
      kinase B1 ortholog PAR-4, the AMPK ortholog AMP-activated kinase-2
      (AAK-2), and the skinhead-1 (SKN-1) transcription factor, which is
      involved in activating phase II detoxification mechanisms (5). It
      has recently been demonstrated that in C. elegans, metformin
      partly elicits its effects through altering the folate metabolism
      of its microbial food source (6), but questions about its direct
      effects are largely unaddressed. It is, for instance, unclear how
      metformin induces AAK-2 and SKN-1 activity. Overall, many gaps
      remain in our knowledge of metformin-induced lifespan extension.<br>
      <br>
      To study the targets of metformin, we performed a proteomic
      analysis on metformin-treated C. elegans and used the results as a
      framework for follow-up experiments. We observed striking
      similarities between metformin-treated and glucose-restricted
      worms and discovered several factors involved in mitohormetic
      regulation of lifespan, including a previously unidentified role
      for peroxiredoxin-2 (PRDX-2), which seems to be responsible for
      translating oxidative stress into a downstream prolongevity
      signal. In addition to lifespan extension, we also report features
      that contribute to the healthspan of metformin-treated worms.<br>

        Molecular Changes in Caenorhabditis elegans upon Metformin
        Exposure: A Proteomic Approach.</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      To gain a deeper understanding of the physiological changes
      elicited by metformin exposure, a differential gel-based
      proteomics experiment was performed. A total of 164 spots with
      differential abundances were detected, 134 of which could be
      identified by mass spectrometry. After removal of duplicate
      identifications, the final analysis resulted in a list of 58
      up-regulated and 30 down-regulated proteins (Dataset S1).<br>
      <br>
      Enrichment analysis (23) of the up-regulated proteins resulted in
      the detection of several overrepresented pathways (Table 1), of
      which the branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) degradation pathway was
      most markedly enriched. All other enriched pathways, including
      glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, are involved in
      general energy metabolism. No significant pathway enrichment was
      observed in the analysis of down-regulated proteins. Combined
      analysis of all differential proteins (both up and down) did not
      reveal additional pathways of interest. <br>
      <br>
      Further functional clustering was used to subdivide the up- and
      down-regulated proteins into meaningful groups (Table 1). For each
      functional cluster detailed information, including subterms and
      proteins in each group, was gathered to assist in data
      interpretation (Dataset S1). These results were used as the
      backbone of hypothesis-driven experiments into the mechanisms
      induced by metformin treatment.<br>
      Metformin Does Not Induce Mitochondrial Protein Unfolding Stress.<br>
      <br>
      Because of the marked clustering of mitochondrial proteins (Table
      1) and metformin’s putative inhibitory effect on complex I of the
      ETC, it needs to be tested whether metformin is capable of
      inducing the mitochondria-specific unfolded protein response
      (UPRmt). This is essential because the UPRmt increases lifespan in
      response to either misfolding of mitochondrial proteins or
      stoichiometric abnormalities in the ETC complexes (24).<br>
      <br>
      We did not observe up-regulation of the UPRmt marker hsp-6 in
      worms exposed to metformin (Fig. 1). Additional experiments with
      higher concentrations of metformin and different exposure times
      yielded similar negative results (Fig. S1). As such, lifespan
      extension of metformin via the induction of the UPRmt is unlikely,
      which suggests that the drug affects the mitochondria in another
      way. <br>
      <br>
      <b>Metformin Increases Lifespan Through Hormetic Phenomena.</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Metformin has been put forward as a possible DR mimetic (7), and
      because DR has been linked to mitohormesis (13, 25), we looked
      into evidence for a role for mitohormesis in metformin-induced
      lifespan extension. Clustering analysis of the proteomics
      experiments revealed a significant overrepresentation of several
      mitochondrial proteins and proteins involved in catabolism (Table
      1). These clusters might point to an increase in respiration, one
      of the hallmarks of mitohormesis (13). Indeed, upon metformin
      treatment, we observed a significant increase in respiration (45%)
      and metabolic heat production (38%) (Fig. 2A) in wild-type worms.
      These changes, in combination with the AMPK-dependence of
      metformin-mediated longevity (5), strongly resemble the
      mitohormetic pathway (13) and might point toward an increase in
      ROS production. <br>
      <br>
      To verify whether mitochondrial ROS production was affected by
      metformin treatment, we measured hydrogen peroxide levels in
      metformin-treated worms. ROS production was indeed increased (Fig.
      2B), further supporting the mitohormesis hypothesis. Induction of
      ROS production was already clear after 24 h of exposure to
      metformin (Fig. 2B). This increase in ROS seems to be an integral
      part of metformin-induced lifespan extension, because treatment
      with the potent antioxidants N-acetylcysteine (NAC) (13) and
      butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) (26) abolished the positive effect
      of metformin on lifespan (Fig. 2C and Fig. S2A). Finally, the
      critical phase for metformin-mediated lifespan extension clearly
      resembles the critical phase for other mitohormetic stressors
      (13), because treatment with metformin starting from adulthood
      onward or during the first few days of adulthood only were
      sufficient to increase lifespan. This is opposed to treatment with
      metformin during larval development only, which had no detectable
      effect on lifespan (Fig. S2B).<br>
      <br>
      <b>Metformin-Mediated Lifespan Extension Requires the
        Peroxiredoxin PRDX-2.</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The mitohormetic pathway as seen during glucose restriction is
      induced when low availability of glucose causes low energy levels,
      which in turn activates AMPK (13). AMPK activity increases
      catabolism and respiration, which results in the increased
      production of ROS and a resultant activation of hormetic
      protective mechanisms (13). The largest hiatus in this pathway is
      the step between the increased ROS production and the induction of
      stress defense: no molecule was put forward that might translate
      the ROS signal into further downstream defense. We therefore set
      out to reveal this missing link and to further complete the
      hormetic signaling pathway.<br>
      <br>
      Peroxiredoxins are known hydrogen peroxide scavengers, and their
      oxidized dimeric form is involved in the direct activation of
      kinases in mammalian cells (27). Because the peroxiredoxin PRDX-2
      was up-regulated during metformin treatment (Dataset S1), this
      protein is of particular interest as a potential inductor of
      mitohormesis. Deletion of the prdx-2 gene results in an extreme
      decrease in lifespan upon metformin treatment (Fig. 2D). Not only
      did the positive effect of metformin on lifespan disappear, the
      prdx-2 experimental group collapsed when exposed to metformin.
      Treatment with NAC partially rescued this deleterious effect,
      implying that excessive ROS production is at least partly
      responsible for the detrimental effect of metformin on these
      mutants (Fig. S2C). In support of these results, we observed
      increased formation of PRDX-2 dimers after metformin treatment
      (Fig. 2E and Fig. S3). Because these oxidized dimers are likely
      involved in cellular signaling (27), we propose that PRDX-2
      induces prolongevity signaling during the mitohormetic response to
      metformin treatment.<br>
      <br>
      One of the potential downstream targets of PRDX-2 is the p38 MAP
      kinase family-1 (PMK-1) protein, which is involved in the
      activation of the SKN-1 transcription factor (28). This
      transcription factor is in turn required for metformin-mediated
      longevity (5). Western blot analysis revealed a marked increase in
      phosphorylation of PMK-1 after metformin treatment. In contrast,
      deletion of prdx-2 resulted in an absence of metformin-induced
      phosphorylation of PMK-1 (Fig. 2F). These data strongly imply that
      PRDX-2 is required for PMK-1 activation after metformin treatment.<br>
      <br>
      In sum, all these findings subscribe that metformin extends
      lifespan via mitohormesis in C. elegans and that PRDX-2 is an
      integral part of the mitohormetic pathway.<br>
      Metformin Inhibits Complex I of the ETC.<br>
      <br>
      Metformin is generally believed to act through inhibition of
      complex I of the ETC (19?–21), although some recent findings cast
      doubt on this (16, 22). Treatment of C. elegans with rotenone,
      another complex I inhibitor, at a concentration that extends
      longevity, results in a decrease in total oxygen consumption (25).
      Our finding that metformin increases respiration in worms
      therefore raises the question of whether it is truly capable of
      inhibiting complex I of the ETC.<br>
      <br>
      We tested whether metformin is able to affect electron flow in
      mitochondria extracted from C. elegans and observed a clear and
      specific inhibition of electron flow from complex I, whereas the
      electron flow from complex II was unaffected (Fig. 3A and Fig. S4
      A and B). These results, clearly mimicking the inhibitory action
      of rotenone (Fig. S4A), complement our previous data only if
      metformin inhibits complex I in a distinct way. To this end, we
      tested whether metformin and rotenone had different effects on ROS
      production in mitochondria. At concentrations at which both
      completely inhibit complex I respiration and after feeding only
      complex I, metformin increased ROS production, whereas rotenone
      decreased it (Fig. 3B), implying a fundamental difference between
      rotenone’s and metformin’s inhibitory action on complex I. <br>

      Many cancer patients survive treatment only to have a recurrence
      within a few years. Recurrences and tumor spreading are likely due
      to cancer stem cells that can be tough to kill with conventional
      cancer drugs. But now researchers have designed nanoparticles that
      specifically target these hardy cells to deliver a drug. The
      nanoparticle treatment, reported in the journal ACS Nano, worked
      far better than the drug alone in mice.<br>
      <br>
      Anti-cancer drugs can often shrink tumors but don’t kill cancer
      stem cells (CSCs). Although CSCs might only make up a small part
      of a tumor, their resistance to drugs allows them to persist. They
      can then cause a tumor to regrow or spread cancerous cells
      throughout the body. Xiaoming He and colleagues wanted to develop
      a nanoparticle system to overcome these cells’ defenses.<br>
      <br>
      The researchers packaged the anti-cancer drug doxorubicin into
      nanoparticles coated with chitosan, a natural polysaccharide that
      can specifically target CSCs. Once in the acidic environment of
      the tumor, the nanoparticles degraded and released the drug. Tests
      on tiny, tissue-like clumps of both normal and cancer stem cells
      in vitro and on human breast tumors grown in mice showed the
      therapy successfully killed CSCs and destroyed tumors. The mice
      showed no obvious side effects.<br>

      Tumor reinitiating cancer stem-like cells are responsible for
      cancer recurrence associated with conventional chemotherapy. We
      developed a doxorubicin-encapsulated polymeric nanoparticle
      surface-decorated with chitosan that can specifically target the
      CD44 receptors of these cells. This nanoparticle system was
      engineered to release the doxorubicin in acidic environments,
      which occurs when the nanoparticles are localized in the acidic
      tumor microenvironment and when they are internalized and
      localized in the cellular endosomes/lysosomes. This nanoparticle
      design strategy increases the cytotoxicity of the doxorubicin by
      six times in comparison to the use of free doxorubicin for
      eliminating CD44+ cancer stem-like cells residing in 3D mammary
      tumor spheroids (i.e., mammospheres). We further show these
      nanoparticles reduced the size of tumors in an orthotopic
      xenograft tumor model with no evident systemic toxicity. The
      development of nanoparticle system to target cancer stem-like
      cells with low systemic toxicity provides a new treatment arsenal
      for improving the survival of cancer patients.<br>

      </b>Stanford scientists have invented a device that produces
      clean-burning hydrogen from water 24 hours a day, seven days a
      week. Unlike conventional water splitters, the Stanford device
      uses a single low-cost catalyst to generate hydrogen bubbles on
      one electrode and oxygen bubbles on the other.<br>
      <b><br>
      </b>The device, described in a study published June 23 in Nature
      Communications, could provide a renewable source of clean-burning
      hydrogen fuel for transportation and industry.<br>
      <br>
      'We have developed a low-voltage, single-catalyst water splitter
      that continuously generates hydrogen and oxygen for more than 200
      hours, an exciting world-record performance,' said study co-author
      Yi Cui, an associate professor of materials science and
      engineering at Stanford and of photon science at the SLAC National
      Accelerator Laboratory.<br>
      <br>
      In an engineering first, Cui and his colleagues used lithium-ion
      battery technology to create one low-cost catalyst that is capable
      of driving the entire water-splitting reaction.<br>
      <br>
      'Our group has pioneered the idea of using lithium-ion batteries
      to search for catalysts,' Cui said. 'Our hope is that this
      technique will lead to the discovery of new catalysts for other
      reactions beyond water splitting.'<br>
      <br>
      <b>Clean hydrogen<br>
        <br>
      </b>Hydrogen has long been promoted as an emissions-free
      alternative to gasoline. Despite its sustainable reputation, most
      commercial-grade hydrogen is made from natural gas, a fossil fuel
      that contributes to global warming. As an alternative, scientists
      have been trying to develop a cheap and efficient way to extract
      pure hydrogen from water.<br>
      <br>
      A conventional water-splitting device consists of two electrodes
      submerged in a water-based electrolyte. A low-voltage current
      applied to the electrodes drives a catalytic reaction that
      separates molecules of H2O, releasing bubbles of hydrogen on one
      electrode and oxygen on the other.<br>
      <br>
      Each electrode is embedded with a different catalyst, typically
      platinum and iridium, two rare and costly metals. But in 2014,
      Stanford chemist Hongjie Dai developed a water splitter made of
      inexpensive nickel and iron that runs on an ordinary 1.5-volt
      battery.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Single catalyst<br>
        <br>
      </b>In the new study, Cui and his colleagues advanced that
      technology further.<br>
      <br>
      'Our water splitter is unique, because we only use one catalyst,
      nickel-iron oxide, for both electrodes,' said graduate student
      Haotian Wang, lead author of the study. 'This bifunctional
      catalyst can split water continuously for more than a week with a
      steady input of just 1.5 volts of electricity. That's an
      unprecedented water-splitting efficiency of 82 percent at room
      temperature.'<br>
      <br>
      In conventional water splitters, the hydrogen and oxygen catalysts
      often require different electrolytes with different pH -- one
      acidic, one alkaline -- to remain stable and active. 'For
      practical water splitting, an expensive barrier is needed to
      separate the two electrolytes, adding to the cost of the device,'
      Wang said. 'But our single-catalyst water splitter operates
      efficiently in one electrolyte with a uniform pH.'<br>
      <br>
      Wang and his colleagues discovered that nickel-iron oxide, which
      is cheap and easy to produce, is actually more stable than some
      commercial catalysts made of precious metals.<br>
      <br>
      'We built a conventional water splitter with two benchmark
      catalysts, one platinum and one iridium,' Wang said. 'At first the
      device only needed 1.56 volts of electricity to split water, but
      within 30 hours we had to increase the voltage nearly 40 percent.
      That's a significant loss of efficiency.'<br>
      <br>
      <b>Marriage of batteries and catalysis<br>
        <br>
      </b>To find catalytic material suitable for both electrodes, the
      Stanford team borrowed a technique used in battery research called
      lithium-induced electrochemical tuning. The idea is to use lithium
      ions to chemically break the metal oxide catalyst into smaller and
      smaller pieces.<br>
      <br>
      'Breaking down metal oxide into tiny particles increases its
      surface area and exposes lots of ultra-small, interconnected grain
      boundaries that become active sites for the water-splitting
      catalytic reaction,' Cui said. 'This process creates tiny
      particles that are strongly connected, so the catalyst has very
      good electrical conductivity and stability.'<br>
      <br>
      Wang used electrochemical tuning -- putting lithium in, taking
      lithium out -- to test the catalytic potential of several metal
      oxides.<br>
      <br>
      'Haotian eventually discovered that nickel-iron oxide is a
      world-record performing material that can catalyze both the
      hydrogen and the oxygen reaction,' Cui said. 'No other catalyst
      can do this with such great performance.'<br>
      <br>
      Using one catalyst made of nickel and iron has significant
      implications in terms of cost, he added.<br>
      <br>
      'Not only are the materials cheaper, but having a single catalyst
      also reduces two sets of capital investment to one,' Cui said. 'We
      believe that electrochemical tuning can be used to find new
      catalysts for other chemical fuels beyond hydrogen. The technique
      has been used in battery research for many years, but it's a new
      approach for catalysis. The marriage of these two fields is very
      powerful. '<br>

      Hyun-Wook Lee, visiting student Zhiyi Lu, and graduate students

      <br>
      I read about a device invented in 1894 that generated electricity
      by discharging static electricity (sparked) within a perminant
      magnet’s magnetic field. A coil was placed within the magnet’s
      field, as well.<br>
      <br>
      There is a brief but intense magnetic field created when static
      electricity sparks. This caused the magnet’s field to fluctuate
      with each discharge. The coil transduced electricity from the
      movement in the magnet’s field caused by the discharge of static
      electricity.<br>
      <br>
      This 100+ year old machine had no moving parts. Just food for
      thought.<br>

      Hi everyone! I wanted to share an experiment I "replicated" about
      four years ago. Dr. T. Galen Hieronymous conducted this experiment
      back in the 1930s and he called it "Conducting Chlorophyll Energy
      over Wires". I call it "Growing Plants in the Dark". It's actually
      an easy experiment to do, but if you don't follow his
      instructions, it will fail (
      http://www.rexresearch.com/hieronym/1hieron.htm ). I feel this is
      solar energy at its finest with Simple Tesla tech involved. I
      tried to upload pictures but was unsuccessful so here is a link
      where I posted at another site with explanations.<br>
      <br>
      <b>http://iaec.forumco.com/topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=992</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      I started this project in either October or November of 2010; too
      much water has passed under the bridge to remember. I ran across
      Dr. T. Galen Hieronymous' work at the Rex Research site You must
      be logged in to see this link. (scroll to the bottom)<br>
      <br>
      If you have never been to the Rex Research site go check it out;
      it has a ton of stuff.<br>
      <br>
      For those who haven't seen my project, I have some pictures with a
      brief explanation.<br>
      <br>
      This first picture shows the plate on the roof. The plate is
      insulated from the mounting bracket and has 5 coats of clear paint
      to protect it from rust. It has an 18 AWG speaker wire attached to
      it that runs down into the basement of the house.<br>
      <br>
      In the basement I have a similar plate attached to the other end
      of the speaker wire and suspended over a planter. In the bottom of
      the planter I have a metal plate that is attached to an earth
      ground via an 18 AWG speaker wire. I enclosed the wooden frame to
      keep light out. Basically I just made a tall box out of it with
      access through the top.<br>
      <br>
      I did not have a control with the first go at this project as I
      was very skeptical to begin with. 10 days after planting a tomato
      seed, I came home from school and had the surprise of my life. The
      photo below is the tomato sprout and is the first time the sprout
      had light on it.<br>
      <br>
      The tomato died a few days later with the same signs indicated by
      Dr. Hieronymous as if it had received too much energy. I made
      another wooden box for a control side and repeated the experiment.
      This time I used potatoes as we live in Idaho USA with potatoes
      growing out our ears and my girl friend didn't want me using the
      tomato seeds.<br>
      <br>
      Below is the control side of the experiment and I know we've all
      seen potatoes do this in storage at our houses:<br>
      <br>
      This is the experiment side with the plates. Notice how the plant
      is growing upwards with well formed stalks. The stalks did not
      turn green, however, the leaves clearly show chlorophyll being
      produced.<br>
      <br>
      I will be doing another "growing plants in the dark" experiment
      this year but will take some time to get under way as I am
      enrolled in 14 credits this semester. None the less, this project
      has opened my mind concerning the mysteries of energy surrounding
      our lives on planet Earth. See ya later tater:) <br>

      <br>
      <b>Introduction</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Sleeping can be complicated business! Those individuals with no
      difficulty achieving healthy, regular sleep would think it the
      simplest of physiologic phenomena. Roughly 30% of the population
      suffers from insomnia, however,[1] which has real and important
      health consequences, in addition to affecting quality of life.
      Even short-term sleep disruption is associated with metabolic
      problems, insulin insensitivity, poor bloodsugar control,
      increased body mass index (BMI), increased pain and inflammation
      levels, and even increased mortality.[2] And pathogenic sleep
      disruption may be a hallmark of or contribute to both psychiatric
      [3] and neurodegenerative disorders.[4]<br>
      <br>
      If you're among the thousands of individuals who suffer from sleep
      difficulties, you might be aware that modern science still has a
      relatively tenuous grasp on the complicated relationships between
      diet, hydration, emotional/spiritual health, environmental
      contributors, and brain chemistry related to sleep. This is an
      area that is receiving considerable attention in scientific study
      at present, and the findings are having far-reaching implications.
      Glycine's role in sleep regulation is an excellent example.<br>
      <br>
      Glycine is a small, nonessential amino acid. It is relatively
      ubiquitous in our muscle tissue and skin, and it plays an
      important role in the regulation and support of many critical
      pathways. Previously considered to be biologically inert,
      unexpected findings in a study using glycine as a placebo to
      investigate the function of other amino acids on the brain led to
      a study on the effects of glycine on human sleep quality and
      patterns.[5]<br>
      <br>
      Glycine undergoes passive diffusion through the blood-brain
      barrier and acts primarily on N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors
      (NMDA).[5] Its actions on the NMDA receptor are believed
      responsible for inhibiting muscle activity during rapid eye
      movement (REM) sleep,[6] and for lowering core body temperature to
      facilitate sleep.[7, 8] Oral glycine administration also increases
      serotonin levels without increasing dopamine levels [5] to help
      normalize circadian rhythms.<br>
      <br>
      In addition to helping objectively normalize the physiology of
      sleep,[8] oral glycine supplementation ameliorates the subjective
      symptoms of sleep deprivation.[9] On testing, subjects report
      improved sleep satisfaction and decreased daytime sleepiness and
      cognitive impairment.[2, 9]<br>
      <br>
      A pinch of glycine powder under the tongue can give immediate
      relief from "spinning thoughts" or over-thinking, which is a
      common complaint among insomniac patients and contributes to
      difficult sleep onset.[9] Indeed, oral glycine powder at bedtime
      ameliorates all subjective symptoms of sleep deprivation, from
      morning fatigue to eye strain and feelings of unease and
      difficulty concentrating, as well as improving memory
      recognition.[10, 11]<br>
      <br>
      This naturally sweet amino acid is safe for ongoing use as an oral
      supplement. At moderate doses, glycine supplementation can help
      normalize sleep architecture to restore the myriad benefits of
      restful, restorative sleep. <br>
      <br>
      <b>Glycine and Mental Health</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Glycine — this smallest and simplest of amino acids was first
      thought to be inert in its effects on physiology.[6] But study in
      recent years shows this little molecule to be a powerhouse! We
      have already discussed the impact of glycine on normalizing sleep
      by acting on the NMDA receptors.[12, 13, 14, 15] Through the same
      mechanism, oral glycine supplementation also helps normalize the
      brain chemistry of addiction and prevent relapse.<br>
      <br>
      Glycine is critically involved in regulating ethanol (alcohol)
      consumption.[13] Elevating concentrations of glycine in the
      signalling junction between neurons has consistently been
      demonstrated to reduce alcohol intake,[13] and inhibit
      drug-seeking for cocaine and amphetamines.[14, 15] The mechanism
      of these effects is still poorly understood, but evidence suggests
      that increased glycine levels also attenuate the effects of
      amphetamines on the brain.[14]<br>
      <br>
      To date, medicine has focused on blocking drug effects in order to
      treat and manage the physiology of addictions. The fact that
      glycine helps both attenuate the effects of drugs like alcohol,
      cocaine, and amphetamines, and to decrease the drive to consume
      these substances is very exciting. It's so exciting, in fact, that
      a series of pharmaceutical drugs are currently being tested to
      modulate glycine uptake, in order to effectively increase the
      amount of glycine in the brain in therapeutic applications.[16]
      Human trials have not yet reported their results for most of these
      medications, but we do know that simply supplementing with oral
      glycine will have similar effects![3]<br>
      <br>
      We can utilize oral glycine to decrease the urge to consume drugs
      and alcohol (both in addicts and among moderate users),[17] and to
      help block the effects when the drugs are consumed. But glycine
      doesn't stop there! Supplementing with oral glycine can improve
      behavioural training to overcome addictions and prevent relapse
      (extinction training).[14, 18, 19] It's unclear whether these
      improvements are related to improved memory recall, such that
      recovering addicts are able to remember and employ their cognitive
      behavioural techniques.[20] We do know, however, that changes to
      glycine levels in the brain correspond with improved attention,
      memory, impulsivity, emotional memory, and intellectual learning
      memory.[21] These traits are all negatively impacted with
      addiction, so a treatment protocol with potential "side effects"
      that help normalize behaviour-related changes opens a world of
      possibilities.<br>
      <br>
      Glycine's therapeutic uses to treat addictions go yet a step
      further. There is evidence that supplemental glycine helps reduce
      liver toxicity from chronic alcohol consumption and expedites
      recovery from alcohol-induced liver injury.[22]<br>
      <br>
      Risks of oral glycine supplementation, even at therapeutic levels,
      are negligible. And so, for a vast number of reasons and
      applications, this little amino acid packs a big punch in
      addiction-recovery protocols.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Brain Health</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The growing body of evidence regarding impact of glycine levels in
      the brain does not end with sleep implications and addictions,
      though these effects alone are exciting for their therapeutic
      implications and potential improvement to quality of life. A good
      deal of study is also looking at the effects of supplementing oral
      glycine as part of pharmacologic management of schizophrenia to
      benefit patient outcomes.[23] Since the late 1980s, there has been
      an understanding that glycine therapy is useful to treat negative
      symptoms of schizophrenia, such as depression and loss of mental
      fluency or flexibility.[24] Recent double-blinded,
      placebo-controlled trials consistently support the conclusions
      that adding oral glycine to the pharmacologic protocols markedly
      improves negative symptoms and cognitive troubles, and may even
      improve psychotic symptoms in some cases.[25, 26, 27, 28]<br>
      <br>
      Since negative symptoms of schizophrenia typically have a larger
      impact on real-world function and impact of the illness than do
      positive symptoms, such as psychosis, the finding that glycine
      supplementation can improve these devastating symptoms is highly
      significant. What's more, these benefits to learning and memory
      retrieval appear to extend beyond applications to mental health
      and addiction recovery to healthy volunteers as well.[3]<br>
      <br>
      As pharmaceutical companies develop drugs to mimic the impact of
      supplementing oral glycine, there is a renewed interest in the
      role of glycine on schizophrenic pathology. Current thinking is
      that impairment of the NMDA receptor system (stimulated by
      glycine) may actually be the cause and pathogenicity of
      schizophrenia.[29, 30]<br>
      <br>
      This new insight into the effects of glycine on the brain spills
      into other psychiatric, mood, and cognitive disorders, ranging
      from psychosis and depression through neurodegenerative diseases
      such as Huntinton's disease and Alzheimer's disease.[29] This line
      of scientific study has led to greater understanding of how oral
      glycine may even be of benefit in treating and managing brain
      injury and stroke.[30, 31, 32]<br>
      <br>
      Examining regulation of NMDA receptors and amino-acid balance has
      led to potential implications with respect to ADHD and autism,[31]
      and greater understanding of the neurochemistry of posttraumatic
      stress disorder and Parkinson's.[32] The implications are
      far-reaching and profound. While some of the study into these
      areas focuses on glycine supplementation directly, much is
      directed toward pharmacologic targets to inhibit NMDA receptors.
      Oral glycine supplementation may effectively accomplish the same
      task.[5] However, while the safety profile of the pharmaceuticals
      has barely begun to be established, oral glycine supplementation
      has a well-established safety profile at therapeutic doses.<br>
      <br>
      As medical science continues to explore the therapeutic benefits
      of glycine supplementation, we will see a growing list of
      advantageous effects for adding this inexpensive amino acid to
      many therapeutic protocols.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Somatic Effects and Dosing</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      In addition to the psychiatric and neurochemical applications of
      glycine supplementation, recent studies are leading us to consider
      this powerhouse amino acid for somatic applications. We have
      already mentioned the hepatoprotective benefit of glycine
      supplementation in the context of chronic and acute alcohol
      abuse.[33] We have also touched on the benefits to traumatic brain
      injury and stroke.[32, 34] These demonstrate additional,
      nonpsychiatric benefits of glycine on other body tissues.<br>
      <br>
      Ischemia (loss of blood supply) is a major cause of death in
      trauma, surgery, and organ replacement. Glycine significantly
      reduces tissue damage and loss in these cases, though the
      mechanism is not fully understood. What is clear is that glycine
      has direct cell-protective effects.[35] It protects against the
      damage of the inflammatory response, which is triggered as
      bloodflow returns to ischemic areas (ischemic reperfusion
      injury).[35, 36] These cell-protective and anti-inflammatory
      effects are not limited to tissue trauma due to ischemia. In fact,
      the anti-inflammatory benefits of glycine have been applied to the
      prevention and treatment of other inflammatory conditions.<br>
      <br>
      Inflammation is the primary mechanism in arthritis. Animal studies
      indicate that oral glycine supplementation can mitigate this
      inflammatory process,[5] and mechanistic study suggests these
      effects have multiple potential therapeutic applications in humans
      as well.[37, 38] Conditions such as ulcerative colitis,[39]
      inflammatory pain,[40] muscle wasting in cancer,[41] and even
      inflammatory contributors to obesity [42, 43, 44] show improvement
      with glycine supplementation.<br>
      <br>
      With the growing body of data supporting therapeutic use of
      supplemental glycine, it is important to note that appropriate
      dosing is not clearly established for most applications. Table 1
      reflects established dosing. <br>
      <br>
      Table 1. Appropriate Dosing of Oral Glycine Indication

      training in addiction recovery.<br>
      <br>
      The safety of glycine supplementation has been clearly
      established. Surgeons routinely utilize an irrigation solution of
      glycine during procedures, delivering relatively high-dose glycine
      without adverse effects. Clinical trials have investigated oral
      glycine supplementation in humans quite thoroughly, indicating
      that long-term oral doses of 31 g/d [44] and 50 g/d [5] yield no
      adverse events. Short-term studies of 200 mg/kg daily of IV
      glycine also yielded no adverse effects.[5] While more study is
      required to fully elucidate the full breadth and potential of
      therapeutic glycine, the mounting body of evidence is certainly
      exciting. <br>

            Teeth Instead</b></big><br>
        <br>
        <b>by Anya V</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Modern society is the first to routinely fill teeth cavities with
      toxic materials as soon as they occur. But we may not need to turn
      to these modern practices if we simply take natural precautions.
      In fact, we may actually be able to remineralize teeth and heal
      cavities naturally with some natural solutions.<br>
      <br>
      For many decades, mercury amalgam fillings were used because the
      malleability of the mercury allowed for the fillings to completely
      fill all the small spaces, tiny grooves, and narrow crevices. The
      temperature sensitivity of the mercury also permitted the filling
      to expand and contract accordingly.<br>
      <br>
      Unfortunately, this practice of immediately filling cavities
      precluded the possibility of the teeth regenerating themselves.
      Plus, we now know that the amalgam solutions pose a noteworthy
      health risk due to mercury exposure.<br>
      <br>
      With the right natural remedies and proper technique, teeth may
      actually be able to rebuild their tooth structure. In this manner
      the tincture of time and patience become the necessary components
      of a self-healing program.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Using Eggshells to Remineralize Teeth</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      One example of a reportedly efficacious protocol for healing
      cavities includes eggshells. Here’s why eggshells are made to make
      for the perfect ingredient:<br>
      <br>
      “Eggshells contain the perfect amount of the ideal substances for
      healing cavities – massive amounts of calcium and 27 other
      minerals. The composition of eggshells resembles our teeth.
      Eggshells provide the necessary amount of calcium to remineralize
      teeth.” [1]<br>
      <br>
      The real key to effectively remineralizing the teeth is providing
      the right minerals in the right balance so that the teeth can
      rebuild themselves. This process can begin in earnest only after
      the mouth has been properly cleansed.<br>
      <br>
      By cleansing it should be understood that all dental materials
      that are toxic or allergenic for an individual are safely removed
      by a biological dentist. Holistic dentistry should also be
      utilized to address any persistent infections in the teeth or
      gums. Cavitation sites, in particular, must be appropriately
      remediated so that any focal infections are completely treated.<br>
      <br>
      By using only dental materials and techniques utilized by a
      toxin-free dentist, the naturally occurring bacterial flora in the
      mouth can be re-established. Likewise, the normal pH of the mouth,
      which is the most conducive for this difficult type of tissue
      regeneration, will prevail over the long term necessary for
      natural cavity filling.<br>
      <br>
      Though it’s recommended to take the previous steps mentioned, one
      thing you can and should do on your own to cleanse your mouth is
      oil pulling. Oil pulling is a very interesting mouth-cleansing
      method that could lead to numerous benefits, and few people know
      about this practice. Read more about the art of oil pulling here.<br>
      What is it about eggshells that makes them so special?<br>
      <br>
      “Bone tissue is composed of calcium. Actually, human bones and
      teeth are very similar to an eggshell’s composition. One of the
      benefits of eggshells is the calcium contained in the shell (93
      %), the bone marrow is fulfilling its hematopoietic function
      better.<br>
      <br>
      Additionally, eggshells also contain mineral elements: magnesium,
      phosphorus, silicon, sodium, potassium, iron, sulfur, aluminum,
      etc.<br>
      <br>
      There are 27 elements found in the eggshells. Also the protein of
      a shell is composed of such essential amino acids as methionine,
      cysteine, lysine, isoleucine. Thus, properly prepared eggshells
      are the most balanced natural means to obtain calcium.” [1]<br>
      <br>
      Refilling teeth cavities naturally is no small task; therefore,
      using the very best filling material that nature has to offer is
      absolutely vital to a successful outcome.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Best Recipe for the Eggshell Formulation</b><br>
      <br>
      First and foremost, the eggshells ought to come from free range,
      organic chicken farms in order to avoid any unwanted chemicals or
      antibiotics. The recipe for this Eggshell Tonic formulation is
      simple and easy to prepare.<br>
      <br>
      <b>How to prepare:</b><br>
      <br>
      “Take eggshells and put them in boiling water for about 5 minutes.
      The boiling will kill any pathogens. Then, air dry the shells and
      grind the shells in a coffee grinder. Take a 1/2 teaspoon a day.
      It is important to note that Vitamin D [via exposure to sunlight]
      greatly aids calcium absorption.” [1]<br>
      <br>
      Homemade eggshell toothpaste can also be made by consulting this
      recipe. By using both the tonic and the toothpaste together, the
      odds will be significantly put in the favor of sufficiently
      remineralizing your teeth so that dental visits can be minimized.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Eggshell toothpaste recipe:</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      ¼ cup ground up eggshells or calcium magnesium tablets<br>
      <br>
      About 2-3 Tbs. coconut oil<br>
      <br>
      1 Tbs. baking soda<br>
      <br>
      Optional ingredients: 1 tsp. castile soap, 1 tsp. sea salt, and/or
      a few drops of peppermint essential oil.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Preparation:</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Rinse eggshells and boil them for a few minutes. This will help
      get rid of any pathogens. Air dry. Grind up the shells into a fine
      powder. Combine the ingredients in a bowl, adding coconut oil
      until it reaches a smooth consistency. Store in a container (jar).<br>
      <br>
      <b>Conclusion</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Every time your teeth are drilled by a dentist, they are
      undermined in profound and irreparable ways. The most common
      dental materials in use today are often toxic and further impede
      the natural healing of the teeth.<br>
      <br>
      Because dental patients are so conditioned over decades to submit
      to highly invasive procedures like root canal therapy, they are
      unaware of the safe natural approaches that have no unhealthy
      consequences.<br>
      <br>
      Eggshell tonic and toothpaste are only two of the ways which can
      help restore the teeth of those who faithfully follow this
      holistic program.<br>

        <br>
        <i>An artificial bone-like material could speed up recovery from
          injury.</i><i><br>
        </i><br>

      Today, a broken hip usually means surgery and extensive rehab. But
      what if all you needed was an injection and a shorter recovery
      period? That’s the vision that inspires Thomas Webster, an
      associate professor of engineering at Brown University.<br>
      <br>
      Webster has developed a nanomaterial that quickly solidifies at
      body temperature into a bone-like substance. This week, Brown
      announced a deal with medical device maker Audax Medical of
      Littleton, Massachusetts, to further develop the material and
      launch trials in animals.<br>
      <br>
      The material contains the same nucleic acids as DNA, Webster says.
      Each molecule has two covalent bonds and links with other
      molecules to form a tube. Hence it’s called a “twin-base linker.”
      (Audax will develop it under the name Arxis.)<br>
      <br>
      “It self-assembles into a nano structure, emulates natural tissue,
      solidifies quickly at body temperature, and can be made to match
      the mechanical properties of the tissue you inject it into,”
      Webster says.<br>
      <br>
      That sounds great, says tissue engineer Kevin Shakesheff, of the
      University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom, but it will also
      need to sustain weight like bone can.<br>
      <br>
      He and his colleagues have developed a different material for the
      same purpose. “If you press down on our material, it’s as strong
      as bone, but if you try and snap it, it’s nowhere near as strong,”
      he says.<br>
      <br>
      Webster says he’s confident that his material, which has so far
      only been tested in a laboratory, will be able to bear weight like
      bone.<br>
      <br>
      “It will have that strength after solidifying in the body — after
      a couple of minutes,” he says.<br>
      <br>
      Ali Khademhosseini, an assistant professor of medicine at Brigham
      and Women’s Hospital and Harvard Medical School in Boston says
      Webster’s material sounds interesting, and there’s plenty of room
      for innovation in the area of bone-like materials.<br>
      <br>
      Today, metal plates are often inserted to provide strength and
      support while bones, such as the hip joint, slowly heal. But the
      metal degrades over time, and particularly in younger patients, it
      may eventually have to be replaced. Khademhosseini says tissue
      engineers are looking for materials that will better integrate
      with the body and last longer. If Webster succeeds in developing
      such a material to replace metal entirely, that would transform
      the field, he says.<br>
      <br>
      Audax will begin testing Arxis in the hip and knee, according to
      company president and CEO Mark Johanson. Johanson hopes to have
      the first product ready for market in 2013. The company recently
      raised $1 million and plans to raise more capital soon, Johanson
      says. If Arxis is injectable on an outpatient basis, the sales
      volume will be high and the price relatively low, Johanson
      predicts. An injection is likely to run $1,000 to $1,500.<br>
      <br>
      “The material can be processed and manufactured relatively
      inexpensively, which positions it well for the
      higher-volume-procedural market,” Johanson <br>

        </big><br>
        <b>by</b><br>
        <br>
        <b>Anya V</b><br>

      <br>
      Tilapia , one of the cheapest and most popular fish in the United
      States, may actually lead to many serious health problems.<br>
      <br>
      Their feed is not natural — in the wild, tilapia would eat algae
      and lake plants, but the farms fatten up the fish on GMO corn and
      soy pellets. The amount of healthful fish oils in these creatures
      is almost non-existent, negating the main reason why fish is so
      good for us. Almost all tilapia sold in the U.S. is hormone drug
      treated. Did you know that the low price of tilapia is achieved by
      converting the young females to males through the use of the
      hormone drug 17alpha-methytestosterone? By having all male
      population allows fish farmers to produce larger fish in a short
      period of time.<br>
      <br>
      Additionally, farmed fish consist of more fat and less Omega-3
      fatty acids due to the smaller area in which they swim, and the
      constant availability of food. Unlike many other fish, farm-raised
      tilapia contains high levels of an unhealthy kind of omega-6. It
      also contains less than 0.5 grams of omega-3s per 100 grams of
      fish.<br>
      <br>
      According to one of the studies, farm-raised tilapia contains
      significantly higher concentrations of PCBs, dioxin and other
      cancer-causing contaminants than salmon caught in the wild. Farmed
      fish contain higher concentrations of contaminants than wild fish
      largely because they are fed meal that consists of ground-up fish
      tainted with contaminants. Many researchers are convinced that
      eating farmed fish leads to an increased cancer risk due to high
      amounts of PCB's the low-quality of nutrients.<br>
      <br>
      Farm-bred fish also have lower levels of healthy nutrients. Many
      of us consume fish, hoping to reap the omega-3 fatty acid benefits
      that come with it. However, did you know that the omega-3-acids
      that are found in farm-raised fish are less usable to our bodies
      compared to wild bred fish. Farm-raised fish also has a lower
      protein content. Not only that, because farm-raised fish are kept
      in cages, they have the tendency to be fattier, and can have a
      higher concentration of omega-6 acids. The problem with getting
      too much omega-6 acids is that they may cause inflammation to the
      body due to imbalance.<br>
      <br>
      Dioxin levels are 11 times higher in farm-bred fish compared to
      wild fish. Dioxin is actually a very toxic chemical that can
      contribute to cancer and other complications. The problem with
      dioxin is that once it enters our system, it can take a very long
      time until it is let out. The half life of dioxin is about 7 to 11
      years. <br>

            Vein</b></big><br>
      </div>
      <b><br>
      </b>June 27, 2012 — Patients unable to breathe because of acute
      lung failure or an obstructed airway need another way to get
      oxygen to their blood -- and fast -- to avoid cardiac arrest and
      brain injury. A team led by researchers at Boston Children's
      Hospital has designed tiny, gas-filled microparticles that can be
      injected directly into the bloodstream to quickly oxygenate the
      blood.<br>
      <br>
      The microparticles consist of a single layer of lipids (fatty
      molecules) that surround a tiny pocket of oxygen gas, and are
      delivered in a liquid solution. In a cover article in the June 27
      issue of Science Translational Medicine, John Kheir, MD, of the
      Department of Cardiology at Boston Children's Hospital, and
      colleagues report that an infusion of these microparticles into
      animals with low blood oxygen levels restored blood oxygen
      saturation to near-normal levels, within seconds.<br>
      <br>
      When the trachea was completely blocked -- a more dangerous "real
      world" scenario -- the infusion kept the animals alive for 15
      minutes without a single breath, and reduced the incidence of
      cardiac arrest and organ injury.<br>
      <br>
      The microparticle solutions are portable and could stabilize
      patients in emergency situations, buying time for paramedics,
      emergency clinicians or intensive care clinicians to more safely
      place a breathing tube or perform other life-saving therapies,
      says Kheir.<br>
      <br>
      "This is a short-term oxygen substitute -- a way to safely inject
      oxygen gas to support patients during a critical few minutes," he
      says. "Eventually, this could be stored in syringes on every code
      cart in a hospital, ambulance or transport helicopter to help
      stabilize patients who are having difficulty breathing."<br>
      <br>
      The microparticles would likely only be administered for a short
      time, between 15 and 30 minutes, because they are carried in fluid
      that would overload the blood if used for longer periods, Kheir
      says.<br>
      <br>
      Kheir also notes that the particles are different from blood
      substitutes, which carry oxygen but are not useful when the lungs
      are unable to oxygenate them. Instead, the microparticles are
      designed for situations in which the lungs are completely
      incapacitated.<br>
      <br>
      Kheir began investigating the idea of injectable oxygen in 2006,
      after caring for a little girl who sustained a severe brain injury
      resulting from a severe pneumonia that caused bleeding into her
      lungs and severely low oxygen levels. Despite the team's best
      efforts, she died before they could place her on a heart-lung
      machine. Frustrated by this, Kheir formed a team to search for
      another way to deliver oxygen.<br>
      <br>
      "Some of the most convincing experiments were the early ones," he
      says. "We drew each other's blood, mixed it in a test tube with
      the microparticles, and watched blue blood turn immediately red,
      right before our eyes."<br>
      <br>
      Over the years, Kheir and his team have tested various
      concentrations and sizes of the microparticles to optimize their
      effectiveness and to make them safe for injection. "The effort was
      truly multidisciplinary," says Kheir. "It took chemical engineers,
      particle scientists and medical doctors to get the mix just
      right."<br>
      <br>
      In the studies reported in the paper, they used a device called a
      sonicator, which uses high-intensity sound waves to mix the oxygen
      and lipids together. The process traps oxygen gas inside particles
      averaging 2 to 4 micrometers in size (not visible without a
      microscope). The resulting solution, with oxygen gas making up 70
      percent of the volume, mixed efficiently with human blood.<br>
      <br>
      "One of the keys to the success of the project was the ability to
      administer a concentrated amount of oxygen gas in a small amount
      of liquid," Kheir says. "The suspension carries three to four
      times the oxygen content of our own red blood cells."<br>
      <br>
      Intravenous administration of oxygen gas was tried in the early
      1900s, but these attempts failed to oxygenate the blood and often
      caused dangerous gas embolisms.<br>
      <br>
      "We have engineered around this problem by packaging the gas into
      small, deformable particles," Kheir explains. "They dramatically
      increase the surface area for gas exchange and are able to squeeze
      through capillaries where free gas would get stuck."<br>
      <br>

      Development Fund at Boston Children's Hospital Boston and a U.S.
      Department of Defense Basic Research Award to Kheir.<br>

      mL oxygen/dL suspension. The microbubbles are preferably less than

      diameter. The microbubbles described herein may be administered to
      a patient in an effective amount to increase in oxygen
      concentration in the patient's blood, and/or one or more tissues
      or organs...<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0004] Every human cell requires a constant supply of oxygen to
      maintain cellular structure and homeostasis. This supply is
      primarily provided by hemoglobin, which carries inspired oxygen
      from the pulmonary capillaries to the tissues. In cases where a
      patient's lungs are unable to transfer adequate amounts of oxygen
      to circulating erythrocytes, severe hypoxia results and can
      quickly lead to severe organ injury and death.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] Restoration of blood oxygen tension is paramount to
      resuscitation of the majority of pathophysiologic states. Some
      clinical states, such as lung injury, airway obstruction, and
      intracardiac mixing, exhibit hypoxemia and desaturation refractory
      to medical efforts to restore levels of oxygen saturation
      sufficient to limit ischemic injury. Ischemic injury may take
      place within minutes or seconds of insufficient oxygen delivery.
      In these conditions, low oxygen tension can result in end-organ
      dysfunction, failure, and mortality. The ability to augment
      oxygenation quickly and non-invasively would have dramatic
      implications on the morbidity and mortality from acute hypoxia, in
      addition to a number of other clinical situations.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] Conventional attempts to restore oxygen levels in patients
      utilize supportive therapy of the patient's respiratory system,
      most commonly by way of mechanical ventilation. However, patients
      with lung injury, comprising a significant population of intensive
      care unit patients, have difficulty exchanging oxygen across a
      damaged alveolar unit. This requires clinicians to increase
      ventilator pressures, often causing further lung injury and
      systemic inflammation. Significant morbidity and mortality has
      been associated with ventilator induced lung injury, and
      barotrauma to the lungs is often necessitated by inadequate
      systemic oxygen delivery. The ability to non-invasively supplement
      even small percentages of oxygen delivery may significantly reduce
      the morbidity of mechanical ventilation.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] Furthermore, emergency efforts to deliver oxygen to a
      patient are often inadequate and/or require too long to take
      effect, either due to lack of an adequate airway or overwhelming
      lung injury. This results in irreversible injury to the brain and
      other organs. Initiation of rescue therapy in these patients is
      burdensome and time consuming, and is available only at a limited
      number of specialized health care centers. There remains a need to
      quickly deliver oxygen directly to the blood of patients, thereby
      preventing or minimizing irreversible injury due to hypoxemia.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] Therefore it is an object of the invention to provide
      improved methods for delivering oxygen to patients, tissues or
      organs.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] It is yet a further object of the invention to provide
      improved compositions for delivering oxygen to patients, tissues
      or organs.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] It is a still further object of the invention to provide
      improved methods for producing compositions for delivering oxygen
      to patients, tissues or organs.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0011] Compositions containing a carrier and microbubbles
      encapsulating one or more gases, preferably oxygen, and methods
      for making and using the compositions are described herein. The
      microbubbles contain a lipid envelope formed of at least one base
      lipid and at least one emulsifying agent. The compositions may be
      administered to a patient to quickly deliver large amounts of
      oxygen to the patient's blood supply or directly to a tissue in
      need of oxygen. The compositions may be administered via injection
      or as a continuous infusion. The compositions contain a
      concentrated microbubble suspension, where the suspension contains
      at least 40 mL oxygen/dL suspension. The microbubbles are
      preferably less than 20 microns in diameter, more preferably less
      than 15 microns in diameter. The microbubbles described herein may
      be administered to a patient in an effective amount to increase
      the oxygen concentration in the patient's blood, and/or one or
      more tissues or organs, preferably in an amount effective to
      prevent or alleviate ischemic injury. The microbubbles may be
      administered alone or in combination with other treatments as an
      adjective therapy.<br>
      <br>
      <b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>I. Compositions</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0021] Compositions containing a carrier and microbubbles
      encapsulating one or more gases, preferably where at least one gas
      is oxygen, for administration to patients, tissues or organs in
      need of treatment are described herein. The compositions are
      particularly preferred for quickly delivering large amounts of
      oxygen to a patient's blood supply or directly to a tissue or
      organ in need of oxygen. The compositions may be administered via
      injection or as a continuous infusion.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0022] A. Microbubbles</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0023] A typical structure for the microbubbles is illustrated in
      FIG. 1. As shown in FIG. 1, the microbubbles contain a gas core
      surrounded by an envelope formed from one or more lipids and one
      or more emulsifying agents in the form of a lipid monolayer or
      multilayer. The outer surface of the envelope forms a protective
      film, preferably formed from polyethylene glycol (see FIG. 1).<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0024] 1. Envelope</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0025] The envelope is in the form of a lipid film, in the form of
      a monolayer or multilayer, preferably in the form of a monolayer.
      The lipid film may be between 1 and 100 nm thick, preferably
      between 1 and 10 nm thick, most preferably between 2 and 5 nm
      thick. In one preferred embodiment, the lipid film is a monolayer
      that is about 10 nm thick. A thin lipid film affords a high
      permeability to oxygen, while preventing a direct gas-blood
      interface.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] Preferably the overall charge for the envelope is neutral.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] The protective border prevents coalescence of the
      microbubbles through either a repulsive electrostatic double layer
      or a short-range repulsive steric barrier. The border also
      decreases recognition and uptake by the reticuloendothelial cells
      (RES) of the microbubble and inhibits complement activation and
      other immunogenic, toxic or thrombogenic effects. Typically, the
      envelope contains from 0.1 to 20% (molar), preferably from 5 to
      10% (molar) emulsifying agent. The emulsifying agent generally
      contains a hydrophilic portion, typically a hydrophilic polymer,
      and a hydrophobic portion. The emulsifying agent or a portion
      thereof, generally the hydrophilic portion of the emulsifying
      agent, forms a protective border on the outer surface of the
      microbubble. Preferably the border is in the form of a brush where
      the hydrophilic portion of the emulsifying agent extends from the
      lipid containing portion of the envelope to form a border on the
      outer surface of the microbubble.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0028] a. Lipids</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0029] A variety of lipids may be used to form the lipid film. The
      lipids may be natural or synthetic. Suitable lipids include
      phospholipids, fatty acids, triacyl glycerols, sphingolipids,
      terpenes, and waxes. Preferably the envelope contains one or more
      phospholipids.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] Generally the lipid envelope contains at least one base
      lipid and at least one emulsifying agent, where at least a portion
      of the emulsifying agent forms a protective film on the outer
      surface of the envelope. "Base lipid" as used herein refers to the
      one or more lipids in the envelope that do not contain a component
      for forming a protective film that reduces surface tension,
      provides mechanical stability and limits gas diffusion.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] The lipid envelope may contain lipids with acyl chains of
      varying lengths and degrees of saturation. The lipid envelope may
      contain lipids with a single acyl chain length, or different
      lipids with different acyl chain lengths. In a preferred
      embodiment, the lipid is a long-chain lipid, preferably a
      saturated diacyl phosphatidylcholine (Di-Cn-PC, where n is between
      12 and 24, preferably where n is 16 or 18), which imparts low
      surface tension, high stability against envelope dissolution, and
      low gas permeability prior to administration in vivo. Suitable
      lipids include phosphocholines, phosphoglycerols, phosphatidic
      acids, phosphoethanolamines, and phosphoserines. Examples include
      1,2-Dilauroyl-sn-Glycero-3-Phosphocholine
      (dilauroylphosphatidylcholine, DLPC),
      1,2-Dimyristoyl-sn-Glycero-3-Phosphocholine
      (dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine, DMPC),
      1,2-Dipentadecanoyl-sn-Glycero-3-Phosphocholine
      (dipentadecanoylphosphatidylcholine, DPDPC),
      1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-Glycero-3-Phosphocholine
      (dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine, DPPC),
      1-Myristoyl-2-Palmitoyl-sn-Glycero-3-Phosphocholine
      (1-myristoyl-2-palmitoylphosphatidylcholine, MPPC),
      1,2-Dimyristoyl-sn-Glycero-3-[Phospho-rac-(1-glycerol)] (DMPG),
      1,2-Dimyristoyl-3-Trimethylammonium-Propane, cholesterol and its
      derivatives, fatty acids, fatty alcohols, and fatty esters.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0067] D. Concentration of Microbubbles</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0068] The microbubbles are designed to release oxygen in
      clinically significant amounts quickly following injection, while
      minimizing build-up in the circulation of the components that form
      the envelope and carrier.<br>
      <br>
      [0069] Thus, the injectable compositions generally contain high
      concentrations of microbubbles, in a minimal amount of carrier for
      the composition to be injected. Typical concentrations range from
      70 to 90% (volume gas/volume injectable composition), preferably
      80 to 90%. As shown in the Examples, suspensions containing from
      40 to 70 mL oxygen per dL suspension have favorable mixing
      properties.<br>
      <br>
      [0070] As shown in the Examples, the volume of the gas core is a
      function of the selection of the length of the acyl chains in the
      lipids that form the envelope. Further, the maximum packing
      density, which is a function of the microbubble size distribution
      and the shape and deformability of the microbubbles, limits the
      maximum gas fraction of the suspension. Preferably the volume of
      the gas core comprises 50% or more of the overall volume of the
      suspension. In one preferred embodiment, the volume of the gas
      core is 50 to 60% of the overall volume of the suspension. In
      another embodiment, lower volume percentages are preferred.
      Microbubble suspensions containing less than 50% gas (by volume),
      may be useful when resuscitation is desired in trauma, or in
      microvascular flaps being treated with microbubbles.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0071] E. Size</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0072] The overall diameter of the microbubbles is selected to
      provide a high surface area to volume ratio, thereby favoring
      rapid transfer of the gas out of the microbubbles. For delivery of
      oxygen to a patient, typically, the microbubbles have diameters of
      about 20 microns or smaller, preferably the upper limit for the
      diameter of the microbubbles ranges from 15 microns or smaller, or
      10 microns or smaller in order to pass through the pulmonary
      capillary bed following intravenous injection.<br>
      <br>
      [0073] Preferably, the lipid monolayer is quite thin (e.g. about
      10 nm), and the volume of the gas core comprises 90% or more of
      the overall volume of the microbubble, typically comprises between
      99.00 to 99.99% of the overall volume of the microbubble.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0074] F. Stability of Microbubble Suspensions</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0075] Microbubbles containing oxygen in their gas core may
      coarsen and break down by ripening (transfer of oxygen from a
      smaller particle to a larger particle due to differences in
      Laplace pressures) or by microbubble coalescence. The rate at
      which both of these processes occur is inversely proportional to
      the envelope cohesiveness, which increases with increasing lipid
      packing density and increasing lipid acyl chain length. Other
      factors, such as suspension viscosity, temperature and
      concentration of oxygen and other gases in the suspension may also
      affect stability.<br>
      <br>
      [0076] The microbubbles described herein may be designed to be
      used immediately following production. In these embodiments, the
      microbubbles are relatively unstable, such as for only a few hours
      following production.<br>
      <br>
      [0077] In other embodiments, the microbubbles are stable in
      storage for weeks to months at room temperature and standard
      pressures (e.g. 1 atm) or at lower temperatures, such at
      refrigeration at 4[deg.] C.<br>
      <br>
      <b>II. Methods of Making the Microbubble Compositions</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0078] Any suitable method for forming the microbubbles, or
      precursors for the microbubbles, may be used. Gas-filled
      microbubbles form by the adsorption of lipid components in the
      precursor suspension to the gas liquid interface of entrained gas
      bodies. This adsorption is generally accomplished by high energy
      conditions, such as amalgamation (intense shaking) or sonication.
      Other methods of gas injection may be used to form microbubbles,
      such as flow focusing, T-junctions or electrohydrodynamic
      atomization.<br>
      <br>
      [0079] Formation of concentrated microparticle suspensions
      requires four general steps: (1) generation of the precursor
      suspension, (2) dispersion of the gas into the precursor
      suspension to form microbubbles, (3) concentration of the
      microbubble suspension and (4) size isolation to form a
      concentrated microbubble suspension with microbubbles having
      diameters below a selected upper size limit.<br>
      <br>
      [0080] The microbubble suspensions may be formed on-site, just
      prior to administration. Alternatively the microbubble suspensions
      may be formed and stored for a suitable period of time and then
      used when needed.<br>
      <br>
      [0081] A system for rapidly delivering oxygen to a patient in need
      thereof typically includes (a) means for generating a microbubble
      suspension, and (b) means for administering microbubbles
      continuously or discontinuously to a patient, tissue or organ in
      need thereof. Means for generating microbubble suspensions include
      sonicator and mechanical agitators, as described below. The
      microbubble suspensions can be administered via injection or by
      continuous infusion or by any other suitable means.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0082] A. Methods for Forming Microbubbles</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0083] Typical methods of forming microbubbles and microbubble
      precursors are known in the art. These methods generally include
      the first two steps listed above and may include additional steps.<br>
      <br>
      [0084] For example, microbubbles may be formed by mixing the
      lipids, i.e. base lipid(s) and PEGylated lipids, in a suitable
      organic solvent, such as chloroform; then evaporating the solvent
      to form a dry lipid film, and resuspending the lipid film in an
      aqueous medium and sonicating to form microbubbles. (see e.g. U.S.
      Pat. No. 7,105,151 to Unger et al.)<br>
      <br>
      [0085] Alternatively, as disclosed in EP 0 077 752 to Schering AG,
      suspensions of gas microbubbles can be made by mixing an aqueous
      solution of a surfactant with a solution of a viscosity enhancer
      as a stabilizer. The gas bubbles are then introduced into the
      mixture by forcing the mixture of reagents and air through a small
      aperture. Similarly, suspensions of gas microbubbles can be formed
      by dissolving each of the lipids in an aqueous solution, such as
      sterile phosphate-buffered saline or sterile saline; then mixing
      the individual lipid solutions in the desired molar ratio to form
      a precursor solution, next the gas can be added to the precursor
      solution by any suitable means, including injecting the gas into a
      sealed container containing the precursor solution and agitating
      the solution to form microbubbles. The desired gas or mixture of
      gases, e.g. oxygen gas, may be perfused through the precursor
      suspension, thereby oxygenating the precursor solution.<br>
      <br>
      [0086] Formation of microparticles is optimal when the suspension
      is kept cool. Thus, preferably the precursor suspension is cooled
      by suitable means.<br>
      <br>
      [0087] Mechanical agitation has been the main method to create
      encapsulated microbubbles for biomedical applications, since their
      inception by Feinstein et al. Feinstein, et al., "Microbubble
      Dynamics Visualized in the Intact Capillary Circulation", J. Amer.
      College of Card., 4(3): 595-600 (1984). Mechanical agitation is a
      common emulsification procedure in which a hydrophobic phase
      (i.e., gas) is dispersed within an aqueous surfactant solution by
      disruption of the interface. Shaking a serum vial with a device
      similar to a dental amalgamator may be used to for oxygen
      microbubbles.<br>
      <br>
      [0088] Acoustic emulsification (i.e. sonication) may also be used
      to agitate the precursor solution and form microbubbles.
      Sonication generates large quantities of microbubbles (100
      mL*10&lt;10 &gt;mL&lt;-1&gt;) rapidly and reproducibly within just
      a few seconds. In sonication, the sonicator horn is typically
      placed at the suspension-gas interface. The precursor suspension
      is sonicated for a sufficient time period at a sufficient power to
      produce the microbubbles. Microbubbles created in this way follow
      a heterogenous size distribution.<br>
      <br>
      [0089] The largest microbubbles are the most buoyant and rise to
      the top of the suspension, while less buoyant, smaller
      microbubbles remain motile in the sonicated suspension. This
      allows for separation based on different migration rates in a
      gravitational field.<br>
      <br>
      [0090] B. Concentration of the Microbubble Suspension and Size
      Isolation<br>
      <br>
      [0091] In a bench scale operation, microparticle suspensions are
      pumped out via a port at the bottom of the glass beaker and into a
      sterile syringe.<br>
      <br>
      [0092] To continue production of the microbubbles, another pump
      simultaneously replaces fresh precursor suspension into the top of
      the glass beaker. Unprocessed microbubble suspensions created in
      this way typically contain 8-10 mL oxygen per dL of suspension.
      The amount of oxygen in the microbubble suspensions can be
      increased by centrifugation.<br>
      <br>
      [0093] A rapid and simple method for concentrating and isolating
      sub-populations of lipid coated microbubbles has been developed.
      This method involves the use of differential centrifugation to
      isolate size-selected microbubbles based on their migration in a
      centrifugal field.<br>
      <br>
      [0094] The relative centrifugal force (RCF) needed for a
      microbubble size class to rise through the column of length L for
      a fixed centrifugation time can be calculated. For example,
      Stokes' equation for the rise velocity of a buoyant particle
      relative to the bulk fluid under creeping flow conditions can be
      used as follows:<br>
      <br>
      [0000] [mathematical formula]<br>
      <br>
      [0000] where subscript i refers to the microbubble size class, ri
      is the microbubble radius and g is the gravitational (centrifugal)
      acceleration measured in RCF. (see Kvale, et al., "Size
      fractionation of gas-filled microspheres by flotation",
      Separations Technology, 6(4):219-226 (1996)). The effective
      viscosity, [eta]2*, of the microbubble suspension can be
      calculated using Batchelor and Greene's correlation for the
      modified fluid viscosity:<br>
      <br>
      [0000] [mathematical formula]<br>
      <br>
      [0000] where [Phi] is total the microbubble volume fraction for Nd
      size classes. (Batchelo &amp; Green, "Determination of Bulk Stress
      in a Suspension of Spherical-Particles to Order C-2", J. of Fluid
      Mech., 56: 401-427 (1972).) Equations 1-3 can be used to calculate
      the strength of the centrifugal field (in RCF) for a given initial
      size distribution, time period and syringe column length.<br>
      <br>
      [0095] Then the centrifuge is run at the rate calculated above to
      remove the largest microbubbles, e.g. greater than 20 microns,
      greater than 15 microns, or greater than 10 microns. For example,
      to remove microbubbles having diameters greater than 10 microns,
      the sample may be run for one cycle at 30 RCF for 1 min. Then the
      cake is discarded, and the infranatant which contains the smaller
      microbubbles is saved.<br>
      <br>
      [0096] If smaller microbubbles are desired, the infranatant is
      redispersed in an appropriate volume of diluent, such as PBS. Then
      the centrifuge can be run at a higher speed, as calculated above,
      to remove the large microbubbles from the sample.<br>
      <br>
      [0097] Using this method, the amount of gas (e.g. oxygen) in the
      microbubble suspensions can be increased 4-fold to 10-fold, or by
      even greater amounts. For example, an unconcentrated suspension
      which contained 8-10 mL oxygen per dL of suspension, was
      concentrated to produce a microbubble suspensions with between 40
      and 90 mL per dL of suspension.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      <b>IV. Uses for the Microbubbles</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0105] The microbubbles may be administered to any patient, tissue
      or organ in need of an increase in oxygen concentration in their
      blood, tissue or organ. The microbubbles may be administered alone
      or in combination with other treatments as an adjuctive therapy.<br>
      <br>
      [0106] Fully saturated whole blood with physiologic hemoglobin
      contains 20 mL oxygen per dL. Microparticle suspensions can be
      manufactured to contain between 40 and 70 mL oxygen per dL of
      suspension. Thus, the injection of one dL of suspension can
      deliver about 40-70 mL of oxygen directly to a tissue or organ in
      need of immediate oxygenation.<br>
      <br>
      [0107] In preferred embodiments, the microbubbles contain oxygen
      and are administered to patients experiencing local or systemic
      hypoxia. Hypoxic or ischemic conditions may arise in a patient as
      a result of a variety of mechanisms, including, but not limited
      to, congenital physical or physiologic disease or disorders,
      embolisms, including thromboembolisms, peripheral artery occlusive
      disease, transient ischemic attacks, strokes, acute trauma,
      surgical interventions, or exposure to chemical or environmental
      agents. The microbubbles are administered in an effective amount
      and at suitable rate for increasing or maintaining the PO2 in a
      patient following administration. Typically, the microbubbles are
      administered in an effective amount and at suitable rate to
      deliver an effective amount of oxygen to a patient to ischemic
      tissues or to desaturated blood in a time ranging from 0.5 to 30
      seconds following administration, wherein the amount of oxygen
      that is delivered is effective to restore PO2 levels to normal
      levels or prevent or alleviate ischemic injury. Microbubbles
      providing immediate release of oxygen are particularly preferred
      for acute resuscitations and resuscitation the heart of a patient.<br>
      <br>
      [0108] In another embodiment the microbubbles provide sustained
      release of oxygen. Such microbubbles may be used to deliver oxygen
      to the brain and other tissues.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0109] Hemorrhagic Shock and Other Trauma Applications</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0110] In acute hemorrhage, resuscitative trauma therapy focuses
      upon restoration of circulating blood volume and oxygen carrying
      capacity. In states of hypovolemic shock, such as resulting from
      severe blood loss, the oxygen extraction ratio of peripheral
      tissues is increased. The result is further desaturation of blood
      returning to the right heart. Models of blunt chest trauma and
      hemorrhagic shock have suggested that right ventricular (RV)
      dysfunction impedes resuscitation efforts.<br>
      <br>
      [0111] In late hemorrhagic shock, myocardial ischemia causes
      impaired contractility. Volume resuscitation of an ischemic,
      dysfunctional right ventricle may lead to increased RV
      end-diastolic volume, causing septal shift into the left ventricle
      (LV), and decreased LV end-diastolic volume.<br>
      <br>
      [0112] The microbubble suspensions can be injected at an
      appropriate concentration and rate to deliver oxygen directly to
      the myocardium in a time period ranging from 3 to 10 second
      following injection. For example, if the microbubble suspensions
      contains from 40 to 70 mL oxygen per dL of suspension, the
      injection of one dL of suspension could deliver approximately
      40-70 mL of oxygen directly to the myocardium.<br>
      <br>
      [0113] Optionally, the microbubble suspension may contain a
      specialized resuscitation fluid, such as synthetic colloid (e.g.
      Hextend(R)) or hemoglobin-based oxygen carrier (HBOC) as the
      carrier. When the microbubbles deliver oxygen directly to ischemic
      tissues, they would leave behind their PEG-rich lipid shell (which
      exhibits favorable oncotic properties) and carrier, serving as a
      volume expander.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0114] Microbubbles as an Adjunctive Therapy</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0115] Oxygen-carrying microparticle suspensions are a useful
      adjunctive therapy in traumatic injury for several reasons.<br>
      <br>
      [0116] In patients with airway failures, injectable microbubbles
      provide a route of oxygen administration which allows survival of
      previously lethal injuries, such as wounds involving the airways
      and those causing severe lung injury. Oxygenated microbubbles
      provide a highly portable form of intravenous oxygen which may be
      used to rescue such patients, allowing them to be transported to
      definitive therapy without ischemic injuries to other organs.<br>
      <br>
      [0117] In patients with cardiac arrest, whether traumatic,
      ischemic or otherwise, successful resuscitation depends upon
      establishing a patent airway, ventilating the patient with high
      oxygen concentrations and adequate chest compressions to provide
      active pulmonary blood flow. All of these interventions must be in
      place in order to raise coronary arterial oxygen content to
      maximize the likelihood of return of spontaneous circulation.
      Intravenous administration of the microbubbles containing oxygen
      may provide a bolus of oxygen to the right side of the heart, in
      an effective amount to improve right heart function via
      endocardial oxygen delivery, improve pulmonary arterial perfusion
      and delivery of blood to the left side of the heart compared to no
      intravenous administration of the microbubbles. Even prior to
      restoration of appropriate mechanical ventilation, microbubbles
      administered via intravenous injection can traverse atelectatic
      lung and perfuse the left heart. The microbubbles may be delivered
      to the left heart in an effective amount to decrease time to
      return of spontaneous circulation and improve outcomes in cardiac
      arrest.<br>
      <br>
      [0118] In patients with hemorrhagic shock, in the low cardiac
      output state, an intravenous injection of rapidly dissolving
      oxygen microbubbles targets the myocardium (the first place the
      microbubbles reach) and delivers the gas core to surrounding
      endocardium. As shown in the animal studies described in the
      Examples, the microbubbles can deliver an effective amount of
      oxygen to rapidly improve cardiac output compared to no treatment
      and serve as an adjunct therapy to volume repletion.<br>
      <br>
      [0119] A concentrated suspension of microbubbles may be added
      directly to existing volume expanders in the field, which may
      improve cardiovascular and cerebral resuscitation. This may serve
      as a useful adjunctive therapy to rescue patients with severe
      hemorrhagic shock, when myocardial ischemia leads to dysfunction,
      inadequate pulmonary blood flow and systemic desaturation. The
      microbubble suspensions can be design to be stable for extended
      periods of time, ranging from days to weeks.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0120] Microvascular Operations</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0121] Microbubbles having diameters of less than 5 microns in a
      diluent such as Dextran may be administered via direct
      intraarterial injection. Microbubbles that are infused towards
      at-risk tissues or a recent microvascular operation, may deliver
      an effective amount of oxygen to improve rheology and oxygen
      content of the perfusate, and thereby improve oxygen delivery in
      these settings.<br>
      <br>
      [0122] As a corollary, in circumstances of focal low flow states,
      such as near-amputations, microbubbles with prolonged bloodstream
      persistence, such as from about 15 to about 45 seconds following
      administration, may be designed such that they circulate in vivo
      until local conditions favor diffusion of oxygen from the
      microbubble core into ischemic tissues (i.e. when they are
      surrounded by a hypoxemic milieu). Because the oxygen content of
      microparticle suspensions upon injection is greater than that of
      saturated whole blood (40-60 mL O2/dL suspension vs. 20 mL O2/dL
      blood), continuous microbubble infusions may be used to raise the
      oxygen content of circulating blood.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0123] Carbon Monoxide Poisoning</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0124] Oxygenated microbubble suspensions carry within them high
      concentrations of oxygen. As such, they may be effective in
      displacing hemoglobin scavengers, such as carbon monoxide. In
      cases of severe carbon monoxide poisoning, circulating
      microbubbles could deliver oxygen directly to the tissues in an
      effective amount to improve hemoglobin function, providing a
      portable temporizing therapy for patients with impaired hemoglobin
      function.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0125] Traumatic Brain Injury</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0126] Infusion of oxygen-bearing microbubbles into the cerebral
      circulation may decrease neuronal death at the ischemic penumbra.
      Given the improved oxygen content of microbubble suspensions over
      that of whole blood, patients with impaired cerebral blood flow,
      e.g. in traumatic brain injury or intracranial hypertension,
      directed administration of oxygenated microbubbles into a carotid
      artery would increase the oxygen content (CaO2) of blood flow
      directed to the brain, and may balance the decrease in flow with
      an improvement in oxygen content. Microbubbles may be mixed in a
      buffered, low viscosity solution (e.g. THAM) and may contain
      antioxidants and other factors known to mitigate neuronal injury
      (e.g. DHA). The polyethylene glycol moiety of the lipids utilized
      in the microbubble envelope exerts significant oncotic pressure,
      which may decrease vasogenic edema.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0127] Cyanotic Congenital Heart Disease</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0128] A unique feature of congenital heart disease is partial or
      complete mixing of saturated and desaturated blood. In
      perioperative states, systemic desaturation can lead to
      significant cerebral and myocardial dysfunction. For example,
      frequently patients with hypoplastic left heart syndrome require
      extracorporeal life support in the perioperative period primarily
      to prevent death due to hypoxemia and the concomitant myocardial
      dysfunction. ELSO. Extracorporeal Life Support Registry Report,
      International Summary; 2008 January, 2008.<br>
      <br>
      [0129] Microbubbles containing oxygen may be administered
      intravenously in an effective amount to raise mixed venous oxygen
      content, systemic oxygen content, and improve myocardial function
      in patients in a perioperative states. Thus the microbubbles can
      be administered in place of a more invasive use of extracorporeal
      life support device.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0130] Pulmonary Hypertension</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0131] Pulmonary hypertension remains a health care problem with
      few effective therapies. Oxygen is known to be a potent pulmonary
      vasodilator. Thus, the microbubbles containing oxygen may be
      administered intravenously in an effective amount to raise the
      oxygen content in pre-capillary pulmonary arterioles and improve
      pulmonary vasodilation compared to no treatment in patients with
      pulmonary hypertension.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0132] Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS)</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0133] Refractory hypoxemia is the hallmark of acute lung injury
      and ARDS.<br>
      <br>
      [0134] Profound hypoxemia accounts for 10% of the mortality of
      this common disorder. Meade et al., "Ventilation strategy using
      low tidal volumes, recruitment maneuvers, and high positive
      end-expiratory pressure for acute lung injury and acute
      respiratory distress syndrome: a randomized controlled trial."
      JAMA, 299(6):637-45 (2008). Microbubbles containing oxygen may be
      administered intravenously in an effective amount to alleviate the
      hypoxemia associated with severe intrapulmonary shunting and
      decrease the mortality and morbidity of ARDS.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0135] Delivery of Microbubbles to Fetuses, Neonates and
        Infants</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0136] The microbubbles may be administered to a fetus, neonate,
      or infant in need of additional oxygen. The microbubbles may be
      administered to low birth weight infants or premature infants. In
      one embodiment, the microbubbles are administered in an effective
      amount to ensure that the fetus, neonate, or infant is receiving
      sufficient oxygen, particularly to ensure that the brain of the
      fetus, neonate or infant receives sufficient oxygen for
      development and maintenance of normal function.<br>
      <br>
      [0137] If a mother is experiencing preeclampsia, the baby must be
      born. Optionally, the microbubbles can be administered to the
      baby, mother, or both in effective amount to deliver an effective
      amount of oxygen to maintain normal normal bodily functions when
      the mother is experiencing preeclampsia.<br>
      <br>
      [0138] Neonates with hypoxic ischemic brain injury at the time of
      birth often suffer from extensive brain injury, manifested as
      cerebral palsy. This may occur due to even brief periods of
      hypoxia during the peripartum period. In clinical situations where
      this is appreciated prior to delivery, such as a nuchal cord or
      placental abruption, injection of microbubbles into the umbilical
      circulation or into the dural space may avert critical hypoxia and
      may ameliorate some forms of hypoxic ischemic brain injury in this
      setting.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0144] B. Methods of Administration</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0145] The compositions containing microbubble suspensions may be
      administered locally or systemically, depending on the condition
      to be treated. The compositions are typically administered via
      injection. In some embodiments the compositions can be
      administered as continuous infusions. In some embodiments the
      compositions are administered intravenously or intraarterially. In
      others, the compositions are administered directly to the tissue
      or organ in need of treatment.<br>
      <br>
      [0146] In one embodiment, the microbubble suspensions are stable
      in storage for prolonged periods of time, and may be withdrawn and
      directly injected without further alterations of the solution.<br>
      <br>
      [0147] In another embodiment, the microbubbles may be formed just
      prior to administration, e.g. within seconds or minutes of
      injection, by a suitable device. The methods disclosed herein
      allow for rapid production of oxygen-containing microbubbles for
      use in clinical settings or in the field.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0148] C. Rates of Administration</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0149] The volume of the gas-filled microbubble suspension to be
      administered is a function of a number of factors including, the
      method of administration, the gas percentage of the microbubble
      suspension, and the age, sex, weight, oxygen or carbon dioxide
      tension, blood pressure, systemic venous return, pulmonary
      vascular resistance, and physical condition of the patient to be
      treated.<br>
      <br>
      [0150] The whole body oxygen consumption of an adult at rest is
      approximately 200 mL oxygen per minute. Thus, in the setting of an
      acute airway obstruction, for example, infusion of 200 mL/minute
      of oxygen would prevent critical ischemic injury. For example
      microbubble suspensions containing 70 mL/dL of suspension can be
      administered at 285 mL/minute to transfer 200 mL/minute of oxygen
      in vivo. Since most of the suspension contains oxygen gas, most of
      the volume decreases following administration and release of the
      gas. Values of co-administered volumes for physiologically
      relevant oxygen demands are shown below in Table 1. Additionally,
      when used in the setting of an acute resuscitation or in
      organ-targeted oxygen delivery, volumes of co-infusate may be much
      lower. For example, a 10 mL bolus of 50% (volume gas/volume
      suspension) microbubbles in adults may provide a suitable amount
      of oxygen to improve the survival of the organ.<br>

      <b>[0151] D. Gas Release</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0152] The microbubbles are preferably designed to release the gas
      encapsulated therein quickly following administration in vivo.
      Typical release times range from 0.5 seconds to 1 minute, with
      shorter time periods, such as from 0.5 to 30 seconds, more
      preferably from 0.5 to 10 seconds, being preferred for acute
      resuscitations and resuscitations of the heart and with longer
      time periods being preferred for delivery of oxygen to the brain.<br>
      <br>
      [0153] In some embodiments, the microbubbles are designed to
      persist in vivo until they reach hypoxic tissue, at which time
      they will release the encapsulated oxygen and the lipid envelope
      with collapse.<br>
      <br>
      [0154] As oxygen is released and the encapsulating envelope
      collapses, the lipid material sheds as micelles and vesicles,
      typically having sizes ranging from 10 nm to 100 nm, which then
      undergo hepatic metabolism. Due to the small size of the lipid
      film relative to the radius of the microbubble, the effective
      volume of lipid is approximately one thousandth of one percent of
      the volume of suspension.<br>
      <br>
      [0155] The lipid material does not persist in vivo for a
      sufficient time to carry carbon dioxide or other gases to the
      lungs. The microbubbles generally release the encapsulated gas and
      the gas is absorbed by hemoglobin prior to the first circulation
      into the pulmonary vasculature. In a healthy adult patient with a
      normal cardiac output, the release of the encapsulated gas
      typically occurs from 4 to 5 seconds following injection, or
      faster.<br>

            Learning Capacity Of The Brain</b></big><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Cannot study for an upcoming exam and wished there was a magic to
      help to pass? Well, your wish just came true in the form of an
      electric thinking cap that speeds up learning and can give you an
      almost super human learning power. So you know what we learn from,
      don’t you? Mistakes. We learn from mistakes and scientists have
      come up with a method that will help you learn from your mistakes
      faster than usual and the next time you will do the task without
      making the same mistake again.<br>
      <br>
      The medial frontal cortex of the brain is believed to be
      responsible for instinctive response when we make a mistake.
      Previous studies have shown that a spike of negative voltage
      originates from medial frontal cortex, milliseconds after the
      person makes a mistake but they never answer why. Researchers
      Robert Reinhart and Geoffrey Woodman from Vanderbilt University
      tested this observation that this activity influences learning by
      allowing the brain to learn from our mistakes.<br>
      <br>
      They carried out experiment to test:<br>
      <br>
      If it’s possible to control the brain’s electrophysiological
      response to mistakes.<br>
      If its effect could be intentionally regulated up and down
      depending on the direction of an electrical current applied to it.<br>
      And how long the result would last and whether the results could
      be applied to other tasks.<br>
      <br>
      The bi-directionality regulated the up and down, depending on the
      direction of current given. The bi-directionality&nbsp; had been
      observed in other animals but not humans.<br>
      <br>
      Researchers applied 20 min of transcranial direct current
      stimulation (tDCS) by using an elastic headband that had two
      electrodes conducted by saline soaked sponges to the cheek and the
      crown of the head. In the process, a mild direct current travels
      from the anodal electrode through skin, muscle, bones, brain and
      out through the cathodal electrode.&nbsp; It does not cause any
      discomfort but a few seconds of tingling or itching. Three
      sessions were carried out randomly on the subjects who were given
      either anodal current that traveled from electrode on the head to
      the cheek or cathodal in which current traveled from cheek to head
      or a sham condition in which the tingling sensation was replicated
      under the electrodes that did not affect brain. The subjects were
      able to tell difference.<br>
      <br>
      After 20 min of stimulation, subjects were given a learning task
      in which they had to figure out which buttons on the game
      controller correspond to specific colors displayed on a monitor.
      Occasionally, a signal was displayed for the subject not to
      respond and they had less than a second to respond, all of which
      made the task quite difficult to provide more opportunities to
      make mistakes and thus for medial frontal cortex to respond.<br>
      <br>
      The moment subjects made mistakes, their electrical brain activity
      was measured. This helped the researchers understand how brain
      activity changed on electrical stimulation.<br>
      <br>
      When anodal current was applied, the spike of negative voltage
      from medial frontal cortex was twice larger. This was reflected in
      their behavior because they made few mistakes and learned from
      them more quickly as compared to sham stimulation. When cathodal
      current was given , the result was totally opposite as the spike
      was quite smaller and the subjects made more errors and took
      longer to learn the task. It was found that the effects of a 20
      min stimulation did transfer to other tasks and lasted about 5
      hours.<br>
      <br>
      It has greater capacity to change learning skill than any

            the IQ by genetic variation in fatty acid metabolism</b><br>

      Children’s intellectual development is influenced by both genetic
      inheritance and environmental experiences. Breastfeeding is one of
      the earliest such postnatal experiences. Breastfed children attain
      higher&nbsp; IQ&nbsp; scores&nbsp; than&nbsp; children&nbsp;
      not&nbsp; fed&nbsp; breast&nbsp; milk,&nbsp; presumably because of
      the fatty acids uniquely available in breast milk. Here we&nbsp;
      show&nbsp; that&nbsp; the&nbsp; association&nbsp; between&nbsp;
      breastfeeding&nbsp; and&nbsp; IQ&nbsp; is moderated by a genetic
      variant in FADS2, a gene involved in the genetic control of fatty
      acid pathways. We confirmed this gene-environment interaction in
      two birth cohorts, and we ruled out alternative explanations of
      the finding involving gene–exposure correlation, intrauterine
      growth, social class, and maternal cognitive ability, as well as
      maternal genotype effects on breastfeeding and breast milk. The
      finding shows that environmental exposures can be used to uncover
      novel candidate genes in complex phenotypes. It also shows that
      genes may work via the environment to shape the IQ, helping to
      close the nature versus nurture debate.<br>

      ...What are the chances that the government (DHS) would be doing
      an “Active Shooter Drill,” in the same exact town, on the same
      exact day that a mass shooting takes place? The answer? Quite
      frankly, almost NONE. No chance.<br>
      <br>
      Furthermore, Jeff Giles from Major Mind job, asked the same
      question I did as well, which was “what are the chances a State
      Senator would die in a mass shooting?” According to Jeff Giles

      Michael Shrimpton is a British barrister (attorney), an adviser to
      British intelligence, and a serious person.<br>
      <br>
      He also is a contributing columnist for the blog, Veterans Today.
      This is his biographical sketch on Veterans Today:<br>
      <br>
      Shrimpton has his own blog, The Shrimpton Report. His email
      address is michael@mshrimpton.co.uk. And Wikipedia used to have an
      entry on him
      (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Michael_Shrimpton), but if you
      go to that URL, you’ll get the messsage: “This page has been
      deleted”.<br>
      <br>
      After you’ve read this post, you’ll know why Wikipedia scrubbed
      its page on Michael Shrimpton.<br>
      <br>
      Shrimpton was a speaker at a forum, date unknown, but probably
      sometime in 2008 (more on this later). Beginning at the 1:42 mark
      of the video below, Shrimpton dropped a bombshell about Obama.<br>
      <br>
      Shrimpton made the following startling claims:<br>
      <br>
      Although Barack Hussein Obama (BHO) is said to have been born on
      August 4, 1961, he actually was born in 1960.<br>
      <br>
      Obama’s alleged mother, Stanley Ann Dunham, was not pregnant in
      July 1961.<br>
      <br>
      Although BHO is said to have been born in Honolulu, Hawaii, he
      actually was born in Mombasa, Kenya, which was then British
      territory, which means British intelligence has his records.<br>
      <br>
      The C.I.A. surreptiously took a DNA sample of Obama at a
      fundraising dinner and ran a test, but could not match Obama’s DNA
      with his [maternal] grandparents, the Dunhams.<br>
      <br>
      Former New York governor and GOP presidential aspirant Rudy
      Giuliani told Shrimpton at a recent lunch that he (Giuliani) knows
      all about this. Giuliani had hoped he would be the GOP
      presidential candidate and he’d then use the information against
      the Democrats.<br>
      <br>
      The Clintons (Bill and Hillary) also know about this.<br>
      <br>
      For the rest of the 1½ hour video, Shrimpton talked about British
      politics and the European Union. However, at the 1:09:30 mark, a
      man in the audience asked Shrimpton a question about Obama and
      Kenya. In his response, beginning at about the 1:11:55 mark,
      Shrimpton alluded to the 2008 U.S. presidential campaign as if it
      was ongoing as he spoke, which suggests that the forum took place
      in 2008. Shrimpton also made these additional claims:<br>
      <br>
      He believes, given the above British intelligence on the year
      (1960, not 1961) and place (Kenya, not USA) of Obama’s birth,
      Obama would “soon be pressured into withdrawing” from the
      presidential race. With the benefit of hindsight, we of course
      know that didn’t happen.<br>
      <br>
      Senator John Edwards also knows because Shrimpton had briefed him.<br>
      <br>
      Former CIA director (under Bill Clinton) also knows. Shrimpton
      does not name him. Clinton had 3 successive CIA directors: James
      Woolsey, John Deutsch, and George Tenet.<br>
      <br>
      The Kenyan government, of course, knows.<br>
      <br>
      The UK newspaper Daily Telegraph also knows.<br>
      <br>
      The Honolulu press is aware that Obama’s birth records in
      Honolulu’s Queens Medical Center are fake. The Honolulu Advertiser
      knows this.<br>
      <br>
      Sen. John McCain knows.<br>
      <br>
      British Intelligence knows because MI5 got the Nairobi Special
      Intelligence files when Kenya became independent.<br>
      <br>
      Kofi Annan, Secretary General of the United Nations from 1997 to
      2006, also knows.<br>
      <br>
      Shrimpton also said something very strange — that Obama’s
      half-sister is actually his full sister, and that the sister is
      “missing.” (The only “half sister” of Obama about whom we are told
      is Maya Soetoro-Ng, the daughter of Stanley Ann Dunham and her
      Indonesian husband, Lolo Soetoro.)...<br>

      This is a lengthy, detailed essay which to some may appear a
      little disjointed. But stay with me as I attempt, in a few words,
      to establish the baseline for the Plan of the Imminent
      Extermination of ‘Humanity’ and this Planet, along with all the
      structures in this Galaxy!<br>
      <br>
      For over 30 years I have attempted to deliver a Message of
      Finality for ‘Human Existence’.<br>
      <br>
      However, the Message has been thwarted by the Fools ­ all of them
      ignorant, and the majority of them EVIL.<br>
      <br>
      The Message was, and is, for all people to prepare mentally,
      emotionally and spiritually for the end of this Physical
      Existence.<br>
      <br>
      This IS the Final Generation for “Humanity” and for Planet Earth!<br>
      <br>
      Physical existence is a sham! It is an Illusion!!<br>
      <br>
      Think about it: We are born. Some die almost immediately. Many
      others die after 50, 60, 70 or so years. The few that live longer
      are, in general, useless, demented cretins who soak up the major
      portion of Social Services and the Health Dollar. Few are wealthy
      enough to be independent of public resources.<br>
      <br>
      The fact that Re-incarnation occurs (yes it does!) only compounds
      the stupidity of recycling idiocy into the Physical. I will refer
      to this topic again below.<br>
      <br>
      Physical Existence has all been an Evil Plot to trap the True
      Spirits in flesh, and exploit them for all they are worth, by the
      Evil Mind that developed this Evil Scheme.<br>
      <br>
      This is a difficult point of the Gnostic Ancient Wisdom to
      comprehend if you are meeting it for the first time. I suggest you
      start by reading my website, if you want to understand what it
      means and then perhaps read my books in the little time that
      remains for a more complete comprehension of the Status Quo.<br>

      It was certainly not a benign, loving Entity who thought up this
      Abomination called the Physical Universe. (My Kingdom is not of
      this World! Jesus said, as per John 8:36 ­<br>
      <br>
      <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/18-36.htm" "><b>http://biblehub.com/john/18-36.htm</b></a>
      .<br>
      <br>
      Forget the Fools, such as the brain-dead Scientists, who claim all
      we are, and see around us, is an accident of Unknown Idiocy. They
      may be that, but the rest of us are not!<br>
      <br>
      There are Levels of Consciousness beyond Humanity that contain,
      and create, Good and Evil things.<br>
      <br>
      This Physical Universe is Evil. It is the Product of EVIL<br>
      <br>
      It has been created by an Evil Mind that lives on exploitation of
      energy from those who have it. Not all consciousnesses have the
      energy that is needed for existence for they are NOT true
      ‘God-created’ consciousnesses. For details you will have to read
      my books, or at least glance at my website: www.jchiappalone.com<br>
      <br>
      Think for a moment. Is not this existence of ours run on a
      dog-eat-dog basis?<br>
      <br>
      Would a Just, Loving Creator really create this mess of pain,
      suffering, misery, mendacity, hypocrisy, murder, deceit,
      injustice, exploitation, disease, injury and death?<br>
      <br>
      Why does the Creator in control seem to favour the biggest
      bastards over the innocent ones?<br>
      <br>
      Yes, in the main, those in control are big, big, spiritual
      bastards, as you will learn if you read my books.<br>
      <br>
      The evil Fools (the Archons, Elite, Illuminati, Reptilians,
      Demons) are clever and stupid at the same time.<br>
      <br>
      They lay the blame for this mess on ‘Man’ for ‘sinning’.<br>
      <br>
      And both mindless idiots and stuporous innocent ones, who, on this
      level, were cut off from the Truth of the Greater Reality, have
      swallowed this tripe for a long, long time.<br>
      <br>
      What is “Sin”? It is a definition the Evil Ones give to exploit
      and punish the rest of us.<br>
      <br>
      Common Man’s Sin is in believing what these Evil Shills tell us,
      even after the Truth is revealed.<br>
      <br>
      If this Mess called Human Existence, with all its misery and
      ignorance, was really due to Man’s Sins, how long do you think it
      would take “man to wake up and correct the situation? 5 Minutes
      perhaps? Most would want to do it instantly, don’t you think?<br>
      <br>
      But no correction has ever happened, has it?<br>
      <br>
      Of course not! That is because this Evil Mess in which we live has
      nothing to do with “Man”.<br>
      <br>
      The System has been created by an Evil Entity this way for ‘its’
      benefit, not Man’s.<br>
      <br>
      If, at this late hour, as you look around a World that is about to
      explode, due to Evil, and you do not belief in Evil, you do not
      deserve to exist any longer. And you won’t! You are brain-dead.
      And soon you will be totally dead ­ Physically, Ethereally,
      Astrally, and Spiritually. The fact that you do not know what that
      implies is of no concern. All you need to know is that very soon
      you will no longer exist in any manner, shape or form!<br>
      <br>
      If you know a little more and are aware of Re-incarnation, the
      evil distortion of Religions, History, Science, the Media, the
      Injustice System, etc., etc., you may still be in the Dark.<br>
      <br>
      Ok, so you know about Aliens and UFO’s, about the Annunaki, the
      Zetas and the Pleiadians, and so on. Big deal! They are all
      non-local aspects of Physicality.<br>
      <br>
      So you read that the Annunaki created Modern Man by genetic
      manipulating of monkey-type precursors. Again, big deal! All they
      did was modify the PHYSICAL BODY in which to trap the same
      consciousnesses and use them as subservient entities, physically
      created in their image.<br>
      <br>
      They themselves were, and are, Evil Bastards who are part of the
      Plot of Exploitation. Bet you didn’t know that, did you?<br>
      <br>
      And they are in physical bodies too, ruling this place as they
      wish. Yep, nearly all of the Elite who occupy positions of Power
      and Governance on this evil, evil Earth are Annunaki Reptiles.
      They will shortly meet their DOOM, as will all others of Evil who
      have been diagnosed as Non-Viable Entities.<br>
      <br>
      Diagnosed as non-Viable? Then there must be Viable entities?<br>
      <br>
      Indeed there are.<br>
      <br>
      So, ‘Judgement’ of Consciousness has already occurred?<br>
      <br>
      Indeed it has. That is the Final Judgment the shills are telling
      you is still to take place.<br>
      <br>
      What does this Viability mean?<br>
      <br>
      It means that those who have been diagnosed as worthy will
      continue their existence in an Evil-free Dimension. This dimension
      is being TOTALLY destroyed!<br>
      <br>
      The ones diagnosed as non-Viable will be TRANSMUTED. They will
      cease to exist FOREVER!<br>
      <br>
      Viability means that those beings can, and will, live in Peace,
      Harmony, and Love, unlike the Evil Bastards who don’t even know
      what those words of Peace, Harmony and Love mean.<br>
      <br>
      There are, on this level, two intermingling Creations: a Benign
      One and an Evil One.<br>
      <br>
      I will give you examples of the Evil One which will support the
      case for extermination of this Evil Existence. This extermination
      is going on right now and we are all intimately involved in the
      process as I shall explain.<br>
      <br>
      Regarding the Evil Creation and its Evil Bastards, I refer you to
      what Jesus is said to have said:<br>
      <br>
      John 8: 44 ­ “For you are the children of your father the DEVIL,
      and you love to do the evil things he does. He was a murderer from
      the beginning. He has always hated the TRUTH, because there is no
      TRUTH in him. When he lies, it is consistent with his character;
      for he is a liar and the father of lies.”
      http://biblehub.com/john/8-44.htm<br>
      <br>
      Those Evil bastards, Sons and Daughters of the Evil Curse, are
      also hypocrites.<br>
      <br>
      You don’t really need an example of their Evil and Hypocrisy, do
      you, at this late stage?<br>
      <br>
      You do?<br>
      <br>
      OK. Let’s go to the incident called 9/11, as an example, which I
      said was the Key to the Collapse of the USA.<br>
      <br>
      Those ‘citizens’, in charge of the USA, who planned it and lied
      about it, are all Annunaki Reptiles. They exist as most of you now
      know, in the human bodies. Their eyes reveal their true nature.<br>

      Feel free to search for other material yourself on this topic.<br>
      <br>
      With the 9/11 plot, they (these Reptilian Demons who were, or are
      still, in charge) unscrupulously murdered the 3,000 plus people,
      their own citizens. The plot was premeditated. It was no accident.
      And it was meticulously, extensively planned, as are most of their
      Evil Moves and Wars as you will see in due course.<br>
      <br>
      These are Demons, made of Evil Stuff.<br>
      <br>
      They cannot create anything but EVIL.<br>
      <br>
      They use evil methods to attain evil gains.<br>
      <br>
      As I implied, they have no guilt, no scruples, no honesty, no
      benign consciousness, no morals or ethics whatsoever. And the
      personnel in the Judiciary, the Media, and the Military that they
      select to protect them are, in the main, of exactly the same
      ontology. Those that are not are bribed, threatened or removed.
      Many, many with scruples, as History reveals, have been
      ‘suicided’. I give some examples below.<br>
      <br>
      These Reptilian Demons hypocritically blamed innocent Nations and
      bombed the existence out of them, murdering millions while
      stealing their wealth. In the meantime, they turned the USA into
      an exploitative prison where the other 99.99% of the population
      were humiliated and made to suffer inexorably with the new
      alphabet groups that joined the jungle of pre-existing ones:<br>

      </b><br>
      They (the Evil Archons, Demons, and Reptiles) are incapable of
      speaking Truth, because such ‘people, beings, illicit, evil
      consciousnesses’ don’t know what Truth is.<br>
      <br>
      Here is one little example:<br>
      <br>
      President G.W. Bush claimed, instantly on being told of the Towers
      being attacked, within that hour, that he saw the first plane hit
      the towers on TV. WHAT???? How big a lie was that? The only film
      of the first plane crashing was released a day AFTER the event and
      a day after he said this. Why have the truthful people not erupted
      in indignation about all those lies?<br>

      This is NOT a one-off occasion.<br>
      <br>
      Villainous Untruth is always presented as Truth by the Evil
      Archons.<br>
      <br>
      The Norm for them, and for this Plane of Existence which they
      fully control, has always been to distort Truth, wherever it
      appears, and to make it non-sensical and perverse, inducing
      Ignorance, Hate and Malice.<br>
      <br>
      Do you recall how incensed the populace was that day after the
      initial shock passed? They were willing to retaliate on that day
      of 9/11? They were willing to attack and murder anybody, anywhere
      to gain revenge.<br>
      <br>
      That was the whole purpose of 9/11 - to mobilize violence, hate,
      anarchy and murder, the very things that feed those of Evil.<br>
      <br>
      Truth is murdered in all the following areas of Human Existence on
      this Level:<br>
      <br>
      Government: You don’t really need me to tell you politicians and
      governments lie to everybody do you?<br>
      <br>
      Science: They are expert at camouflage. Look back through History
      and see how Evil Science has been.<br>
      <br>
      The latest lying fiasco, of course, is the way NASA has lied to us
      about the existence of Planet X. Cursed they are indeed. The
      honest scientists who want to reveal the Truth are silenced by
      blackmail, or else are ‘suicided”<br>
      <br>
      Here is Dr David Morrison, on behalf of NASA denying the existence
      of Planet X:<br>

      with the Truth that the Archons do not want revealed:<br>

      2 The Holocaust Hoax Exposed by Victor Thorn (Barnes review)
      ­book.<br>
      <br>
      Get it and read it!<br>
      <br>
      I have gone to some length to make this point of Evil’s Untruth in
      society, for in every facets of existence on this level that you
      can name you will find Untruth and the Perversion of Truth. If you
      want more details, read my website and books.<br>
      <br>
      Why is it so? Jesus had the answer, as revealed in the Gospel of
      Thomas (Nag Hammadi Library
      -http://www.gnosis.org/naghamm/gosthom.html<br>
      <br>
      ‘The sacerdotes (priests, those in charge) have taken the Keys of
      Knowledge and hidden them’<br>
      <br>
      Matthew 23:113: “But woe to you, scribes and Pharisees,
      hypocrites! For you shut the kingdom of heaven in people’s faces.
      For you neither enter yourselves nor allow those who would enter
      to go in.”<br>
      <br>
      My point is that this ‘Human” existence is an evil pack of lies,<br>
      <br>
      And it must be brought to an End, as it shall be!<br>
      <br>
      Fear Not! Evil Beings are cursed by their Evilness.<br>
      <br>
      Once out of the Physical each being will receive exactly what it
      deserves, no more and no less!<br>
      <br>
      Do some of the Merry Cans reading this essay find it hard to
      believe that their illustrious and eminent Leaders, controllers of
      the wealthiest, and militarily the most potent, Nation on Earth
      are capable of such deception, mendacity, and hypocritically
      murderous acts that others clearly see, in 9/11, and in all the
      other wars in which they have engaged?<br>
      <br>
      For elucidation of such Evil, and the reason why it exists as it
      does, consider these facts:<br>
      <br>
      At Foundation, the Fathers of the fledgling United States
      dedicated the Nation to the Evil Principal, Satan, no less.<br>
      <br>
      All bar 2 of the Founding Fathers were Masons who worshipped, and
      continue to worship, even in this day and age, Satan.<br>
      <br>
      Watch the video below to dispel any doubt that indeed that is what
      Masons do!<br>
      <br>
      <a

        "><b>http://www.anonymousmags.com/hidden-camera-masonic-ritual-satan-worship-exposed/</b><b><br>
        </b></a><br>
      I guess some of you will want to know the names of the 2
      exceptions. B. F. and T. P. are the two.<br>
      <br>
      BTW, there is an evil creep (a Vulturite Reptilian no less) called
      Steffan Stanford who claims he is the re-incarnation of Thomas
      Paine. Lend him no ear. He is an evil fool and he was certainly
      not Paine.<br>
      <br>
      Since its inception, the USA has been the most notoriously cruel
      and efficient tool of the Evil Principle.<br>
      <br>
      It has waged unjust war on more countries than people can
      virtually count, and it has been an instrument of murder, pain,
      torture and pilfery, never seen in the History of Modern Man.<br>
      <br>
      Apart from the facts of 9/11, consider the lies that the Leaders
      have used for all the wars enumerated in the articles below and
      all the illegal and criminal abuse and torture of victims that it
      has refused to disclose but which are well known by those who
      truly seek the Truth. Getting their Courts to rule that details
      will not be publically disclosed adds insult to injury.<br>
      <br>
      As the evil Karma which the USA has earned makes itself known to
      its people who supported it in its iniquities, you will know the
      trauma to ensue was earned by the spilling of blood of many
      innocents in the last 200 years or so.<br>

      </b><br>
      The real, but esoteric reason for the never-ending bellicosity is
      the fact that these wars are conducted for the Evil Essence to
      gain energy from the trapped TRUE souls on this planet.<br>
      <br>
      (AS to why I say TRUE souls, you will have to read my website
      and/or books.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, all this time the USA has been efficiently doing the work of
      Satan, whether you want to believe it or not.<br>
      <br>
      Under those circumstances, how could the Real GOD Consciousness
      Bless America?<br>
      <br>
      It is true that the people whom they ruled were, and to some
      extent are still, blinded to these facts. But, no more! Now with
      all the afflictions they have imposed on American citizens,
      including Jade Helm, we have the abundantly clear cue to awaken
      fully to the evil that has us all trapped in this “Human
      Existence”!<br>
      <br>
      On this level, as on all physical levels, we are in a War of
      Essences.<br>
      <br>
      That is why prophecy is not always accurate. Often it is used as
      Propaganda to fool the other side in the War. For example, I said
      a massive Earthquake would hit California in late May this year in
      a recent radio Show with Jeff Rense. Nothing much happened apart
      from lots and lots of other earthquakes and volcanic eruptions
      everywhere else around the Pacific Rim. Well, I did give a 4%
      window of it not happening in the show. But, a far more massive
      event will occur in the future, make no mistake about that.<br>
      <br>
      Let’s move on.<br>
      <br>
      These Evil Bastards created by the Essence of Evil, in its Image,
      do not acknowledge any Truth.<br>
      <br>
      They do NOT respond to True, Universal Love. They do not possess
      it either. Sure, they respond to Emotional Love which is a
      biological phenomenon created by our hormones. In place of True
      Love they have unfathomable GREED and LUST.<br>
      <br>
      These evil beings exist everywhere throughout the Universe or what
      remains of it!<br>
      <br>
      Why do I say that?<br>
      <br>
      Well, while we Humans have been isolated to such an extent that
      the majority don’t even believe in LIFE outside of our little nest
      called Earth, 95-96% of the Physical Universe has been purposely
      dismantled by the ‘Sons’ of the True Light. Mind you, there is no
      gender in spiritual existence.<br>
      <br>
      Yes, once the Error occurred and the Evil Mind that spawned it
      refused to allow correction of the Error that spawned Evil, a War
      ensued whose endpoint we on Earth are to experience in the next
      TWO YEARS.<br>
      <br>
      The entire illicit Physical Universe is being dismantled brick by
      brick. Over 95% is already gone.<br>

      </b><br>
      The Dark Matter and Dark Energy are the result of dismantling
      ‘normal’ Matter created by Evil.<br>
      <br>
      Those substances cannot now sustain consciousness and will
      disappear when the dimension is totally dismantled and “closed”.<br>
      <br>
      It is now the turn of this Galaxy, called the Milky Way, to
      undergo this fate.<br>
      <br>
      That is why the consciousnesses in all classes within it have been
      diagnosed as either Viable or non-Viable. This includes the
      Elementals in the Mineral Class, Consciousness in Vegetation, the
      Animals Consciousnesses, Humans, the beings in the 5th Class which
      is the Devic Kingdom where Angles, Devas, and the evil, ruling
      Demons come from, the Galactic Class which spawns the
      consciousness of planets, Comets, Meteors and Solar Systems, etc.,
      etc., and finally Class 7 ­ the Universal Consciousness.<br>
      <br>
      You don’t believe this?<br>
      <br>
      Ask your friendly Astronomer to find what happened to the 95% of
      the Physical Universe that is missing!<br>
      <br>
      The Whole Galaxy is being destroyed and all the evil components
      trashed back into Primordial Energy so that the EVIL in them can
      no longer manifest.<br>
      <br>
      Have you not been paying attention to the skies?<br>
      <br>
      Have you not seen photos of other Galaxies being destroyed or
      swallowed up by massive Black Holes?<br>
      <br>
      Have you not been aware of the disintegration of Mars, and
      Jupiter, and Neptune, and Venus, etc.?<br>
      <br>
      Where have you been? Asleep?<br>
      <br>
      I repeat: The Whole Galaxy is scheduled for demolition, and that
      includes our physical home ­ the Earth.<br>
      <br>
      From the outset, 30 years ago I mentioned the destructive process
      to affect Earth, including meteors, comets and rogue planetary
      bodies. It is the Final Solution to the Problem of Evil.<br>
      <br>
      That meteors strike the Earth is a fact. The timing of future ones
      is debatable.<br>
      <br>
      But……<br>
      <br>
      Planet X is a rogue Planetary Constellation, is it not?<br>
      <br>
      You don’t believe it exists? Do your homework.<br>
      <br>
      The Elite are attempting to keep the general populace blind and
      stupefied by many means, including Chemtrails, Fluoride in
      drinking water, GMO food products, drugs, legalized Marijuana with
      which to pacify the fools that consume it, etc., etc.<br>
      <br>
      But, they know it is a pointless exercise and that sooner rather
      than later the populations at large will know of the danger Planet
      X presents to unprepared ones who will panic in the extreme. That
      is why the Military of all Nations has been primed to corral and
      kill those who react with anger and create anarchy.<br>
      <br>
      What those Military fools obeying such orders don’t realize is
      that, apart from shooting and killing their own Nationals, their
      own parents and families, their own children and friends, they are
      exposed to the same dangers and death processes as everyone else.<br>
      <br>
      Why can they not see that? They have been drugged enough to become
      mindless automatons, unthinking, valueless, robotic beings.<br>
      <br>
      The real answer to what is before us is not to fool the masses and
      then kill those who complain and the revolutionaries.<br>
      <br>
      What is the real answer? The real answer, for which it is almost
      too late, was to tell people the Truth, as I have been trying to
      do for 30 years, and advise them to prepare for the Physical
      Extermination of the Planet and the PHYSICAL Human Race.<br>
      <br>
      But, the evil fools who are the Elite think they can outrun this
      danger by hiding as rats do in their DUMPS (Deep Underground
      Military Bases).<br>
      <br>
      I am here to tell you they cannot cheat their Fate. They will NOT
      PHYSICALLY SURVIVE.<br>
      <br>
      They will be subjected to the same diagnostic fate as the rest.
      And, being failures, they will undergo that which awaits them.<br>
      <br>
      The Russian, Norwegian &amp; Brazilian Governments have all made
      some efforts to inform their Populace about the Pending Danger
      from Planet X<br>
      <br>

      The Evil Essence could never get anything correct. That is why
      everything in the Physical broke, and still breaks down. Some say
      Murphy’s Law in this evil environment is optimistic.<br>
      <br>
      Anyhow, this Planet X Constellation has been a curse to this Solar
      System for a long time. But this will be the last time, for it and
      the whole Solar System and the Galaxy, like I said, are being
      destroyed.<br>
      <br>
      Within this month of June, 2015, and certainly in July, Planet X
      will probably be visible to the naked eye from everywhere on
      planet Earth. It will grow larger and larger in the sky for all to
      see.<br>
      <br>
      Its effects on the planet will increase with an unmistakeable
      maliciousness.<br>
      <br>
      It will get warmer;<br>
      <br>
      The Earth will boil from within;<br>
      <br>
      Volcanic Eruptions will lead to more problems as will the
      Earthquakes and Tsunamis that follow.<br>
      <br>
      Apart from the dust and meteorites in the tail of the
      Constellation that will bombard and suffocate all life on the
      planet, in due course, there are 2 other major meteors scheduled
      to strike Earth and cause massive destruction, one in September
      and one in November this year.<br>
      <br>
      By mid-March 2016, the Iron Oxide Dust from Planet X will be so
      effusive on Earth that most aerobes will perish and water,
      massively polluted, will be deadly to living things.<br>
      <br>
      Revelations 16:3: The second angel poured out his bowl on the sea,
      and it turned into blood like that of a dead person, and every
      living thing in the sea died.<br>

      Revelations 16:4: Then the third angel poured out his bowl on the
      rivers and springs, and they became blood.<br>

      </b><br>
      As Planet X approaches us and then heads outward again, its
      magnetic and gravitational effects will cause the Earth to fall on
      its Physical Axis and the displaced Seas will drown everything
      even as the Earth fractures.<br>
      <br>
      The fools who thought they would survive this calamity will be
      boiled in, and drowned by, the lava seeping up from the depths of
      Tartarus.<br>
      <br>
      No one will survive to the end of 2016 according to the
      information at hand.<br>
      <br>
      What about all the accounts of time-travellers who give accounts
      of Earth way beyond the 21st Century?<br>
      <br>
      They are either recounting implanted thoughts or else relating
      stories of existence in parallel physical dimensions which are
      more advanced than this one, still evil, yet similar, and also
      scheduled for destruction.<br>
      <br>
      I have had this information to distribute since 1985. Few
      listened.<br>
      <br>
      What is the point of it all?<br>
      <br>
      The point is for ALL people, especially the Viables, to prepare
      Mentally, Emotionally and Spiritually.<br>
      <br>
      So, we are ALL going to physically die?<br>
      <br>
      So what? Who cares?<br>
      <br>
      Do you know how many times you have physically died? It is
      thousands of times for sure. And yet you are still in existence,
      are you not?<br>
      <br>
      It is the Ignorance imposed on us by the Evil Controller that
      denies us this knowledge. The physical bodies have a Filtering
      Mechanism that prevents us from recalling our Past Lives and
      Experiences. That fact in itself is evil. Why should we not have
      that knowledge?<br>
      <br>
      Not knowing who we are, and were, and what has happened to us
      makes us easier targets to be exploited by this cruel, very Evil
      System in which we live. Indeed it is an Illusion of a Virtual
      Reality which must, and will be, destroyed totally.<br>
      <br>
      Using certain abilities, some people are able to bypass the
      Filtering Mechanisms and recall Past Lives on Earth, on other
      planets, in other Galaxies, in sub-dimensions and also lives in
      the Astral World.<br>
      <br>
      Some children under the age of 8, in particular, are able to
      recall Past Lives, and the literature is replete with such
      examples. Here are 2:<br>

      Physical Death is no more that the Consciousness moving out of the
      useless and obviously dysfunctional meat bag ­ Cardboard Box ­ as
      I like to call it, into another level of existence.<br>
      <br>
      On death, one will experience something similar to what Near Death
      Experiencers describe.<br>
      <br>
      But now, as it is the Endtime for this Galaxy, the ethereal and
      Astral Realms around each planet are being dismantled and each
      consciousness will be in the “Void”, twixt Heaven and Hell as it
      were.<br>
      <br>
      There it will be given its assessment.<br>
      <br>
      Those to proceed will go to where they are directed.<br>
      <br>
      Those who are to be terminated will go into Transmutation Vats and
      will soon be gone forever.<br>
      <br>
      But, for the very Evil Demons, it is not a simple matter of
      ‘Lights Out’. No; they will pay a heavy price for the iniquities
      they forced innocent ones to bear. I will not go into detail lest
      you become even more stirred than what you already are with this
      essay.<br>
      <br>
      Divine Justice will prevail.<br>
      <br>
      Mercy is wasted on the Evil Ones, for they know not genuine
      repentance.<br>
      <br>
      This brings me to the idiotic and very evil shills you will come
      across on the Internet urging you to hurry up and repent as ‘Jesus
      the Christ’ is coming!<br>
      <br>
      They are as stupid as they are evil.<br>
      <br>
      You cannot be saved by saying a few words in a state of self-pity.<br>
      <br>
      ‘Jesus the Christ’ is not coming in the future.<br>
      <br>
      “He”, that Energy/Consciousness, has been on the planet for quite
      a while.<br>
      <br>
      I wrote above that the ‘Final Judgement’ has already occurred and
      that the course of spiritual separation of Viables and Non-Viables
      has already been set.<br>
      <br>
      In fact, it occurred before November 1999 when the majority of
      Theomorphic Viables, about one billion individuals, were
      spiritually evacuated. You can read about hat in my essay called
      “The Phase of the Shells” on this site and on my website.<br>
      <br>
      What these evil shills and idiots on the internet are calling the
      “Lord” is Planet X, a bomb for the physical.<br>
      <br>
      So, let’s end this essay with a very important question.<br>
      <br>
      How does one know if s/he is a viable?<br>
      <br>
      That’s easy to answer. Read the following carefully.<br>
      <br>
      After you have bypassed the shock of what I have written, the
      shock felt on your outer mind, and after you have bypassed those
      eruptive emotions within you, and after you have settled down and
      contemplated on this essay, and its Message, and after you have
      even had a good night’s sleep and thought deeply about his, how do
      you feel, deep within your soul?<br>
      <br>
      If you are truly joyous at seeing the end of all the Pain,
      Suffering and Misery this world contains, and which are shocking
      the very life out of you and all ‘good’ people, and you are
      impatient to see the end of all Evil and willing to journey forth
      to a Home of Truth, Peace, Love and Eternal Tranquillity, then
      friend, get ready to zoom into the Evil-free dimension.<br>
      <br>
      If you are frightened witless by this essay, I urge you to
      contemplate the information in it further. All may not be lost.
      Cleanse you mind and body. Get off alcohol, meat, most dairy
      products, and illicit drugs. Wave your evil friends goodbye. You
      know who they are. These are all instruments of pollution which
      cut your spiritual sight. Turn your mind to things of importance,
      to the Numinous, and then see how you feel.<br>
      <br>
      If you are externally angered by what I have written, but in all
      honesty feel fear in the very depth of your being, prepare to meet
      the real Godforce who will direct you.<br>
      <br>
      If you laugh this information off, you are an oaf who does not
      deserve to continue.<br>
      <br>
      I will be seeing all the Viables ON THE OTHER SIDE.<br>
      <br>
      THERE IS NO CHANCE WE WILL MISS EACH OTHER.<br>
      <br>
      Where do I get the audacity (and authority) to write such an
      essay?<br>
      <br>
      Who do I think I am to scare people this way?<br>
      <br>
      My aim is not to scare anyone.<br>
      <br>
      My aim is to prepare all of you for the inevitable.<br>
      <br>
      My identity is not important.<br>
      <br>
      What IS important is the answer to this question: Are you Viable
      or non-Viable?<br>
      <br>
      You will know the answer to that question as soon as you decipher
      the conundrum.<br>

      <br>
      The mystery swirling around Vladimir Putin has just gotten
      stranger.<br>
      <br>
      According to Putin’s ex wife, former First Lady of Russia Lyudmila
      Putina, Putin has been long dead and she refused to cooperate with
      Power Elite in this ruse.<br>
      <br>
      She claims that Putin’s assassination had been in the works for
      some time and was a well plotted out plan.<br>
      <br>
      Putina also claims her and her daughter were threatened with death
      if they didn’t play along.<br>
      <br>
      Translation of German article:<br>
      <br>
      A german newspaper ie Welt published a sensational interview with
      former First Lady of Russia Lyudmila Putina.<br>
      <br>
      My husband, unfortunately, have long been dead.<br>
      <br>
      I have to admit it publicly, because I could no longer see what is
      happening on his behalf.<br>
      <br>
      It’s terrible people.<br>
      <br>
      They did not stop at nothing.<br>
      <br>
      I am afraid that now they will kill me and daughters as well as
      killed him.<br>
      <br>
      Our family was not exactly perfect.<br>
      <br>
      When I got married, I was in love with intelligence officers. But
      the reality was quite different.<br>
      <br>
      Putin was a vile, cruel man, a tyrant.<br>
      <br>
      He never considered me, simply did not notice my existence.<br>
      <br>
      I needed it only for reference and the composition of the family
      as a mother for his children.<br>
      <br>
      I find it hard to talk about it, but Putin beat me, humiliated,
      made fun of me.<br>
      <br>
      Life with him was torture.<br>
      <br>
      I tried to fight, not just going to file for divorce.<br>
      <br>
      But this man did not have anything sacred.<br>
      <br>
      To silence me, he handed me over to a psychiatric clinic.<br>
      <br>
      I went through all the circles of hell … narcotics, psychotropic
      substances, bullying.<br>
      <br>
      For a long time I was locked up in prison for a long time and I
      never saw sunlight never seen people.<br>
      <br>
      I still remember it with horror.<br>
      <br>
      From young and self-confident woman, I became a shadow, my will
      was broken, I sogalsilas all conditions, only to come out.<br>
      <br>
      But that began after his death, all is beyond description. <br>
      <br>
      He was then a difficult period.<br>
      <br>
      I’m sure he did not tell, I became even more withdrawn.<br>
      <br>
      A month before the death of the night, without warning brought
      daughters – I do not even know where.<br>
      <br>
      And then he was gone completely.<br>
      <br>
      At night we came home, some people – some of them I knew, someone
      saw the first time.<br>
      <br>
      Break everything upside down, we reviewed all the papers, all the
      walls in the house rattled.<br>
      <br>
      They told me only one thing: “If you want to live – be silent.”<br>
      <br>
      All questions about her husband briefly replied that he would soon
      come that he important retreat and in the interest of national
      security is not worth it to me with anybody to discuss.<br>
      <br>
      A few days later came his first … understudy.<br>
      <br>
      Later I learned that the murder of Vladimir prepared ahead of
      time, it eliminated when the first twin was almost ready to take
      his place.<br>
      <br>
      Outwardly, he was of course very much like Putin – I was
      impressed.<br>
      <br>
      But it was a completely different person.<br>
      <br>
      They somehow managed to track down the girls.<br>
      <br>
      And I issued an ultimatum – or I play the role of devoted wife or
      me or daughters no longer live.<br>
      <br>
      I had no choice. I first tried to avoid public events.<br>
      <br>
      Corrosive media attention, intrigue and gossip – all this sickens
      me.<br>
      <br>
      But I pretend to be the wife of another man was even worse.<br>
      <br>
      So they prepared a double for me – when I say that something does
      not go as planned scenario, wipe out embarrassments.<br>
      <br>
      If they had time to bring my double to more or less successful
      similarities would have killed me long ago.<br>
      <br>
      Miraculously, we managed to escape.<br>
      <br>
      For obvious reasons, I can not call the people who have helped us
      to stop this terrible dramatization and escape.<br>
      <br>
      “Divorce” was my deliverance.<br>
      <br>
      Now I live abroad, I’m fine.<br>
      <br>
      But I’m afraid to see what is happening with Russia.<br>
      <br>
      People come to your senses!<br>
      <br>
      You live like beggars, barely making ends meet, because you
      mercilessly obovorovyvayut and deceive.<br>
      <br>
      And now there is a question of the survival of the indigenous
      people of Russia.<br>
      <br>
      If you do not stop a coward and ignore what is happening in the
      country – you do not live.<br>
      <br>
      So could this account by Putina be true? <br>
      <br>
      Is Vladimir dead and been dead for some time now?<br>
      <br>
      The conspiracy surrounding the question of body doubles and fake
      Putins is confirmed by his ex wife.<br>
      <br>
      Another possible ocnfirmation to this is last year WorldTruth.Tv
      published an article titled&nbsp; ‘NWO Attempted Assassination of
      Vladimir Putin, But Got the Wrong Plane‘ and I got a lot of slack
      for publishing the truth.<br>
      <br>
      Now the elite have completed their agenda, they actually got to
      Vladimir Putin and he was killed and replaced with a body double.<br>
      <br>
      The German newspaper Die Welt published a sensational interview
      with former First Lady of Russia Lyudmila Putina.<br>
      <br>
      My husband, unfortunately, have long been dead.<br>
      <br>
      I have to admit it publicly, because I could no longer see what is
      happening on his behalf. It’s terrible people.<br>
      <br>
      They did not stop at nothing. I am afraid that now they will kill
      me and daughters as well as killed him.<br>
      <br>
      Our family was not exactly perfect.<br>
      <br>
      When I got married, I was in love with intelligence officers.<br>
      <br>
      But the reality was quite different. Putin was a vile, cruel man,
      a tyrant.<br>
      <br>
      He never considered me, simply did not notice my existence.<br>
      <br>
      I needed it only for reference and the composition of the family
      as a mother for his children.<br>
      <br>
      I find it hard to talk about it, but Putin beat me, humiliated,
      made fun of me.<br>
      <br>
      Life with him was torture.<br>

      “. . .In defence of the freedom that is our birthright. . .we have
      taken up arms. We shall lay them down when hostilities shall cease
      on the part of the agressors, and all danger of their being
      renewed shall be removed, and not before.”&nbsp; -John Hancock<br>
      <br>
      For well over the last decade BATR has argued that the Republic is
      dead. Now that the Supreme Court has rendered their decision on
      Obamacare, there can be no doubt that the funeral for a nation,
      born out of a revolution for liberty, is over. The country, buried
      in the ashes of totalitarian despotism, is now history.<br>
      <br>
      The plurality of citizens naively accepts that the national
      government has legitimacy. Such a claim is erroneous. What more
      proof does one need that slavery is the official status for the
      American public. The implication of affirming the health insurance
      mandate sets the precedent for and escalates an unlimited federal
      tyranny.<br>
      <br>
      The twisted interpretation that a forced and binding purchase of
      medical coverage is justified because the government can tax its
      citizens is demonic in its inception. Coercion as a mean for
      compliance is like whipping your indentured servant for the
      privilege of serving the master.<br>
      <br>
      By opening the flood-gate of unlimited federal taxation authority
      to compel behavior, guarantees punitive submission for a limitless
      concoction of social engineering. It is a short leap to require ID
      chip implants and compulsory designated conduct.<br>
      <br>
      The hijacking of health care by a mandatory federal oppression
      pushes citizens to renounce their fidelity to a constitutional
      framework, already abandoned by the political power elite.
      Constrains and separation of the “Federalism” system of shared
      authority, is now eliminated. The central government is
      all-supreme in the gulag version of benevolent dependency.<br>
      <br>
      The Supreme Court is a pitiful tool of the executive autocrat that
      wheels administrative regulation like a crazed beast. Chief
      Justice John G. Roberts Jr. is a disgrace. Whether his decision
      reflects intimidation or legacy hubris, the net effect is that he
      shoveled dirt on the tombstone of the constitution.<br>
      <br>
      The seemingly limit on the commerce clause is circumvented by
      validating that taxing obligated conduct is legal. This extreme
      viewpoint condones any dictate by government fiat that Congress
      conspires to force people to obey. Such a conclusion abdicates the
      essence of constitutional protections.<br>
      <br>
      Natural law is not arbitrary and subject to the whims of radical
      statists. Ignoring fundamental human rights is the definitive
      abuse against humanity. The federal government is making the nanny
      state into a chamber of horror.<br>
      <br>
      Immutable principles that protect individuals from compulsory
      demands that violate free choice always are reprehensible.
      However, the latest rebuke to the sovereign dignity of citizens –
      poisons the water for any thirsty seeker of liberty and justice.<br>
      <br>
      The consequences of the added financial costs from the Obamacare
      administration are frightening. The devil is in the details, never
      was more appropriate. Driving the economy off a cliff is a
      designed strategy of the collectivist criminals. The unholy
      alliance of big pharma, health insurance corporatists and
      dedicated Marxists want the public to be docile serfs in a land of
      slaves.<br>
      <br>
      Add this dire result of the horrendous increase in taxes from the
      “Taxmageddon” catastrophe come the end of this year and you have a
      meltdown formula for a second depression. The Tea Party advocates
      are correct, “Taxed Enough Already” gains new meaning with the
      legalization of Obamacare.<br>
      <br>
      Conversely, how can the legislation be legal when a Supreme Court
      that is determined to worship at the altar of an absolute tyranny
      violates the rule of law itself?<br>
      <br>
      Incrementalism is the gradual assimilation of society into a
      different matrix of acceptability. This judicial tragedy is a
      rapid surge to the system. The body politic is under assault by a
      deadly virus of biblical dimensions. The core reasons for the War
      of American Independence seem trite when compared to the level of
      perdition experienced under the succession of recent presidents.<br>
      <br>
      The bipartisan despotism of both Bush presidents, Clinton and now
      Obama only accelerate acquiescence to a virtual dictatorship. In
      order to understand the nature of the dilemma, appreciate the
      message in The Meaning of Independence Day.<br>
      <br>
      The justification for a Second American Revolution should be
      self-evident. However, there are few real Americans left, who
      comprehend the unique heritage of this nation. A spontaneous
      uprising to overthrow the political outlaws is unlikely. With that
      admission, the moral imperative still requires a personal
      commitment to oppose the corrupt regime that proceeds in enslaving
      society.<br>
      <br>
      The tipping point is upon us. The chains you wear are shackles you
      lock each day; you observe, obey or consent to unlawful
      government. You have the power to refuse compliance. Confront the
      consequences or suffer the indignation of a life of servitude.<br>
      <br>
      Celebrate this July 4th with a renewed dedication that the future
      of American lies in the moral authority of civil disobedience.<br>
      <br>
      “A general dissolution of principles and manners will more surely
      overthrow the liberties of America than the whole force of the
      common enemy. While the people are virtuous they cannot be
      subdued; but when once they lose their virtue then will be ready
      to surrender their liberties to the first external or internal
      invader.” – Samuel Adams<br>

                Planes Speaks Out</b></big><br>
          </div>
          <br>
          “I flew the two actual aircraft which were involved in 9/11;
          the Fight number 175 and Flight 93, the 757 that allegedly
          went down in Shanksville and Flight 175 is the aircraft that’s
          alleged to have hit the South Tower.<br>
          <br>
          I don’t believe it’s possible for, like I said, for a
          terrorist, a so-called terrorist to train on a [Cessna] 172,
          then jump in a cockpit of a 757-767 class cockpit, and
          vertical navigate the aircraft, lateral navigate the aircraft,
          and fly the airplane at speeds exceeding it’s design limit
          speed by well over 100 knots, make high-speed high-banked
          turns, exceeding — pulling probably 5, 6, 7 G’s.<br>
          <br>
          And the aircraft would literally fall out of the sky. I
          couldn’t do it and I’m absolutely positive they couldn’t do
          it.” <br>
          <br>
          For a guy to just jump into the cockpit and fly like an ace is
          impossible – there is not one chance in a thousand,” said
          Wittenberg, recalling that when he made the jump from Boeing
          727’s to the highly sophisticated computerized characteristics
          of the 737’s through 767’s it took him considerable time to
          feel comfortable flying.<br>
          <br>
          “The airplane could not have flown at those speeds which they
          said it did without going into what they call a high speed
          stall.<br>
          <br>
          The airplane won’t go that fast if you start pulling those
          high G maneuvers at those bank angles. … To expect this
          alleged airplane to run these maneuvers with a total amateur
          at the controls is simply ludicrous…<br>
          <br>
          It’s roughly a 100 ton airplane. And an airplane that weighs
          100 tons all assembled is still going to have 100 tons of
          disassembled trash and parts after it hits a building.<br>
          <br>
          There was no wreckage from a 757 at the Pentagon. … The
          vehicle that hit the Pentagon was not Flight 77. We think, as
          you may have heard before, it was a cruise missile.”<br>

            Their Medical Bills</b><br>

      If you want to understand why medical care expenses are so
      expensive today and want to be able to explain it to others, read
      this post.<br>
      <br>
      If you know someone faced with huge medical bills they cannot
      afford, read this post.<br>
      <br>
      I am in favor of paying bills. I am in favor of paying medical
      bills - REASONABLE medical bills. Most medical bills today are NOT
      reasonable. The prices charged are far too high (as compared with
      a free market system), and they are (most of them) what are known
      as "adhesion contracts." I'll explain what that is, but first some
      history.<br>
      <br>
      The reason medical care costs today are so expensive is because
      the government has become more and more involved in the industry,
      and this has raised the cost for everyone.<br>
      <br>
      Before WWII and for all of American history before that, people
      could pay their own medical bills with no problem. There was no
      "crisis." There will always be poor people in society, especially
      when "poor" is defined as the bottom X% of the population. By that
      definition, there will always be poor people, and they can and
      should turn to charity for help.<br>
      <br>
      Back then, there was no such thing as health insurance. People
      could pay their doctor bills. Health insurance came about as a way
      for people NOT to pay their doctor bills but to recover LOST WAGES
      during times they were sick. Lost time from work was a bigger
      financial problem than the bills themselves. Originally, "health
      insurance" was more like what today would be called disability
      insurance.<br>
      <br>
      During WWII, the federal government instituted price and wage
      controls. This meant that employers could not increase salaries.
      So, employers started offering "fringe benefits" as a way to
      attract the best people. This is when employers started paying for
      health insurance for employees.<br>
      <br>
      In the 1950's, the tax code was changed so that employers could
      deduct health care insurance paid on behalf of employees. Tax
      deductions are good, but it should have been at the individual
      level. Since so many employers were now paying these costs
      (because of the previous government meddling), this was very
      popular.<br>
      <br>
      In 1965, Medicare was passed, making the federal government a huge
      "payor" of health care costs. In 1973, Congress passed the HMO
      Act, requiring larger employers to provide HMO's for employees.<br>
      <br>
      Since then, there have been numerous other ways the federal
      government has pushed its way in (unconstitutionally) to the
      health care industry.<br>
      <br>
      Today, even before Odumbacare, the federal government is by far
      the largest payor of health care expenses, and HMO's are next
      largest. Together, they dominate the terms of what they will pay
      for health care expenses.<br>
      <br>
      Since the individual usually does not pay for their medical
      expenses, doctors make more money doing multiple tests. They get
      paid more for that, too. But the government and HMO's often refuse
      to pay the full price. So, doctors get paid less than they
      expected on the procedures they do, and so they look to everybody
      else to make up the slack.<br>
      <br>
      The slack is paid for by individuals with their own health
      insurance and those who pay cash. Since doctors are so used to
      doing every test and procedure they can think of (because they
      benefit from that by charging more to the government and HMO's),
      they do this with individuals, too. It is estimated that people
      paying cash pay 3 times the amount that the federal government
      does for the same things.<br>
      <br>
      This is why health care costs are so high.<br>
      <br>
      But, if you get a doctor or hospital bill, you usually do NOT have
      to pay it.<br>
      <br>
      That's because almost all such bills are adhesion contracts. An
      adhesion contract is a "take it or leave it" contract. One side
      dictates the terms, and the other side must take it or leave it.
      But the terms are not known up front. So, the person taking it has
      no idea what they are taking.<br>
      <br>
      In fact, most such bills are not contracts at all. A contract
      requires a "meeting of the minds." If a doctor does not tell a
      patient (a) what will be done or (b) how much it will cost, then
      there is no meeting of the minds. Further, even if it is a
      contract, it is an adhesion contract.<br>
      <br>
      Adhesion contracts are VOIDABLE by the party who did not create
      the contract. So, a person with a huge medical bill can REFUSE to
      pay it by declaring it VOID.<br>
      <br>
      Having said that, I do not recommend actually voiding it. Better
      is to notify the doctor or hospital that you MIGHT declare it void
      and instead work out a reasonable fee that you will pay in a
      reasonable amount of time.<br>
      <br>
      Today, there are more and more clinics actually publishing their
      rates. A person could use those prices as a good faith method of
      determining a fair price to pay (and doing business with such
      doctors are NOT adhesion contracts because the amounts are known
      up front, unlike 99% of the industry). One doctor running such a
      clinic stated that he originally thought his costs would be 1/2 of
      what other doctors were charging. He really had no idea because he
      never had control over costs. What he found was that his costs are
      actually 1/6 to 1/8 of the costs of doctors who get paid by
      traditional means. So, the health care industry is costing 6-8
      times what would be the case in a free market.<br>
      <br>
      So, the government has created this mess with more and more
      intrusion into the health care industry over several decades. The
      solution, of course, is to REPEAL such laws (including the
      prohibition of selling insurance across state lines). Let the FREE
      MARKET return to the health care industry and the problems will be
      solved.<br>
      <br>
      In the meantime, any large medical bills can be NEGOTIATED down to
      a reasonable amount and, if necessary, declared VOID.<br>

      <br>
      This is a short presentation about what is being done to
      everyone's rights and the rule of law by way of the assault on
      Doreen Hendrickson, which is a crime being committed for the
      equally evil purpose of keeping you and your neighbors from
      knowing the liberating truth about the tax.<br>
      <br>
      Youtube description: The Shocking Truth the IRS Doesn't Want You
      to Know: The limited nature of the 'income' tax...<br>
      <br>
      Buried in Supreme Court rulings, legal minutia, tax code jargon,
      and the minutes from Congressional hearings is the truth that the
      what is commonly referred to as the income tax is meant to be a
      simple excise tax levied on those benefiting in some way from a
      federal privilege.<br>
      <br>
      This means that government workers and office-holders, federal
      reserve bankers, subsidy recipients, investors in federal
      corporations, and any other person benefiting from the profitable
      exercise of federal privilege were meant to pay the tax, NOT
      independent hard-working American citizens.<br>
      <br>
      Relevant Court Hearings:<br>
      <br>
      "...in Spinger v. U. S., 102 W.U. 568 (1880), it was held that
      [the] tax upon gains, profits, and income was an excise tax or
      duty, and not a direct tax, within the meaning of the
      constitution, and that its imposition was not, therefore,
      unconstitutional." - United States Supreme Court, Pollock v.
      Farmer's Loan &amp; Trust, 158 U.S. 601 (1895)<br>
      <br>
      "...taxation on income was in its nature an excise entitled to be
      enforces as such," United States Supreme Court, Brushaber v. Union
      Pacific R. Co., 240 U.S. 1 (1916), quoting and reiterating
      language used in its ruling in Pollock v. Farmer's Loan and Trust<br>
      <br>
      It Did Not Change After 16th Amendment:<br>
      <br>
      "The provisions of the Sixteenth Amendment conferred no new power
      of taxation..." - Stanton vs. Baltic Mining Co., 240 U.S. 103
      (1916)<br>
      <br>
      "The Sixteenth Amendment, although referred to in argument, has no
      real bearing and may be put out of view. As pointed out in recent
      decisions, it does not extend the taxing power to new or excepted
      subjects..." - Peck vs. Lowe, 247 U.S. 165 (1918)<br>
      <br>
      “The income tax is, therefore, not a tax on income as such. It is
      an excise tax with respect to certain activities and privileges
      which is measured by reference to the income which they produce.
      The income is not the subject of the tax: it is the basis for
      determining the amount of tax.”<br>
      –F. Morse Hubbard, Treasury Dept legislative draftsman. House
      Congressional Record, March 27, 1943<br>
      <br>
      These findings, along with other research meticulously gathered by
      Pete Hendrickson and presented in Cracking the Code, outline the
      limited nature of the income tax. This information, if truly
      understood and effectuated by the American public, could limit
      government faster than any electoral result or any half-baked
      reform scheme coming out of Washington D.C.<br>
      <br>
      In 'Free Speech on Trial,' you will see the lengths to which the
      minions of the corrupt federal system will stoop to tread upon the
      rights of freedom-loving Americans and keep their illicit scam
      under wraps.<br>

      <div align="center"><big><b>Doreen Hendrickson Sentenced to 18
            Months in Prison for Upholding the First Amendment in Court</b></big><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Editor's Note: Doreen has just been sentenced to 18 months prison.<br>
      <br>
      Doreen Hendrickson, wife of Pete Hendrickson, author of Cracking
      the Code- The Fascinating Truth About Taxation In America will
      soon have a court hearing set for sentencing by Eastern District
      of Michigan federal judge Victoria Roberts on a contempt of court
      charge. Sentencing had originally been set for November 20, 2014,
      was then changed to Dec. 10, and now will take place in early
      2015.<br>
      <br>
      This is a case of retaliation against Doreen’s husband for his
      book, which clearly defines the difference between taxable income
      and earnings that are not taxable under the IRS Code. Though
      numerous attempts have been made to discredit and suppress the
      book, especially through deliberate misrepresentation of its
      contents by government officials, nothing actually revealed in the
      book has ever been disputed.<br>
      <br>
      Not being able to dispute the veracity of the book, and having
      been forced to return billions of improperly-collected tax dollars
      to hundreds of thousands of readers over the eleven years Cracking
      the Code... has been in print, the full weight and force of the
      IRS and the United States Justice Department have been leveled
      against the wife of the author. It might be noted here that even
      organized crime has a code of honor that they will do no harm to
      the wives and children of their adversaries.<br>
      <br>
      Officially, Doreen is being punished for resisting orders written
      by a DOJ attorney and issued by a federal judge commanding her to
      replace her previous sworn statements in a legal dispute over
      whether or not she owed federal income taxes with sworn statements
      dictated by the government. The coerced statements would declare
      that she believes herself liable for the disputed amounts.<br>
      <br>
      Although a government official signing such statements himself
      would serve as a claim to the money, none has been willing to do
      so. The total dollar figure involved in the case that would either
      remain with Mrs. Hendrickson or transfer to the United States is
      less than $1000.<br>
      <br>
      This is not a Tax Case!<br>
      <br>
      This case involves government orders that Doreen declare, under
      penalty of perjury, something she believes to be untrue. The
      contempt charge is for refusing to obey the order. This is a
      blatant disregard of her First Amendment right to free speech. Can
      the government, even through a judge, order anyone to say
      something not believed to be true and then cite her for contempt
      for refusing to obey the order? The government says yes, but the
      First Amendment says no!<br>
      <br>
      The federal prosecutors-- specialists flown in from Washington--
      even had the audacity to ask (and were granted) that the jury be
      barred from considering the “unlawfulness or unconstitutionality”
      of the orders.<br>
      <br>
      The jury was lied to by the DOJ prosecutors, while Doreen was
      prevented from completing her opening and closing arguments. Over
      and over again, throughout the trial, the US attorneys kept saying
      Doreen was only being ordered to "say what was correct". Their
      Closing Argument was little more than pounding on the podium and
      shouting that Doreen was told what was correct by the judge, and
      so how could the jury imagine that she could honestly believe
      otherwise?!<br>
      <br>
      The First and Fifth Amendment rights of all Americans are on the
      chopping block in the prosecution of Doreen Hendrickson, and the
      precedent it sets. What might YOU be ordered to say for the
      government's convenience?<br>
