      <br>
      Named the “ovillanta,” the device is essentially a mosquito trap
      made of two sections of a recycled car tire. Cut into half
      circles, the two pieces are molded into a mouth-like shape, the
      bottom of which is filled with a milk-based solution that attracts
      mosquitoes. A valve to release liquid sits at the base of the
      ovillanta, allowing the researchers to drain and filter the
      device.<br>

      <div align="center"><i>Researchers studying nanowires have found a
          battery material that can be recharged for years, even decades</i><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Imagine a battery that could be recharged for decades. No more
      getting rid of cell phones because of waning battery life. No more
      landfills filled with lithium ion batteries.<br>
      <br>
      This is one step closer to reality, thanks to work by researchers
      from the University of California at Irvine.<br>
      <br>
      The discovery that could lead to ultra-long-life batteries
      happened by serendipity. A team of researchers led by Reginald
      Penner, chair of the university’s chemistry department, had been
      studying nanowires, tiny conductive wires that show great promise
      for use in batteries. The problem is nanowires are fragile and
      generally begin to fray and crack after a certain number of
      charging cycles.<br>
      <br>
      One day, Mya Le Thai, a PhD candidate in Penner’s lab, decided on
      a whim to switch the liquid electrolyte surrounding the nanowire
      assembly with a gel version.<br>
      <br>
      “She started to cycle these gel capacitors, and that’s when we got
      the surprise,” Penner recalls. “She said, ‘this thing has been
      cycling 10,000 cycles and it’s still going.’ She came back a few
      days later and said 'it’s been cycling for 30,000 cycles.' That
      kept going on for a month.”<br>
      <br>
      The team realized they had something special on their hands. While
      they’re still not certain why using a gel electrolyte seems to
      keep the nanowires from breaking down, they have a hypothesis. The
      gel, Penner explains, is about as thick as peanut butter. The
      nanowires, which are hundreds of times thinner than human hair and
      made of manganese oxide, are 80 percent porous. Over time, the
      thick gel slowly seeps into the pores in the nanowires and makes
      them softer. This softness reduces their fragility.<br>
      <br>
      “After 5,000 cycles with normal liquid, [the nanowires] start to
      break,” Penner says. “And then they start to fall off. None of
      that is happening in the gel.”<br>
      <br>
      Right now, the team is working to test this hypothesis. If it’s
      correct, they’ll continue to experiment with different types of
      materials and gels to see what works best. Should the work hold
      up, the gel-wrapped nanowires could eventually be a component in
      ultra-long-lasting batteries. This is likely several years down
      the road, Penner says, though he has been fielding calls from
      companies interested in his lab’s creation.<br>
      <br>
      “The big picture is that there may be a very simple way to
      stabilize nanowires of the type that we studied,” Penner says. “If
      this turns out to be generally true, it would be a great advance
      for the community.”<br>
      <br>
      Since most household electronics have life spans limited by
      factors besides battery life, a battery that lasts for a decade or
      two could easily outlive the device it powers.<br>
      <br>
      “If you could get 100,000 cycles out of a lithium ion battery it
      might mean you never need to buy two of them,” Penner says. “We’re
      talking about a lifetime of 20 years, maybe even longer than
      that.”<br>

            Thinks of Journalists? <br>
            Here's What Happened When It Hired Some.</b></big><br>
        <br>
        <b>Michael Nunez</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      …if you really want to know what Facebook thinks of journalists
      and their craft, all you need to do is look at what happened when
      the company quietly assembled some to work on its secretive
      “trending news” project. The results aren’t pretty: According to
      five former members of Facebook’s trending news team—“news
      curators” as they’re known internally—Zuckerberg &amp; Co. take a
      downright dim view of the industry and its talent. In interviews
      with Gizmodo, these former curators described grueling work
      conditions, humiliating treatment, and a secretive, imperious
      culture in which they were treated as disposable outsiders. After
      doing a tour in Facebook’s news trenches, almost all of them came
      to believe that they were there not to work, but to serve as
      training modules for Facebook’s algorithm….<br>
      <br>
      The news curation team writes headlines for each of the topics,
      along with a three-sentence summary of the news story it’s pegged
      to, and choose an image or Facebook video to attach to the topic.
      The news curator also chooses the “most substantive post” to
      summarize the topic, usually from a news website. The former
      contractors Gizmodo interviewed said they were asked to write
      neutral headlines, and encouraged to promote a video only if it
      had been uploaded to Facebook. They were also told to select
      articles from a list of preferred media outlets that included
      sites like the New York Times, Time, Variety, and other
      traditional outlets. They would regularly avoid sites like World
      Star Hip Hop, The Blaze, and Breitbart, but were never explicitly
      told to suppress those outlets. They were also discouraged from
      mentioning Twitter by name in headlines and summaries, and instead
      asked to refer to social media in a broader context.<br>
      <br>
      News curators also have the power to “deactivate” (or blacklist) a
      trending topic—a power that those we spoke to exercised on a daily
      basis. A topic was often blacklisted if it didn’t have at least
      three traditional news sources covering it, but otherwise the
      protocol was murky—meaning a curator could ostensibly blacklist a
      topic without a particularly good reason for doing so. (Those we
      interviewed said they didn’t see any signs that blacklisting was
      being abused or used inappropriately.)...<br>

      <br>
      A related part of this problem is the fact that most people work
      indoors and fail to get sufficient exposure to full, bright, and
      natural sunlight during the day. This disconnect from the natural

      <br>
      Nowadays, the food we consume is substantially changed in relation
      to the one which was once eaten. Namely, our diet is no longer
      based on raw, hard foods which demand a lot of chewing.<br>
      <br>
      Instead, we often eat softer food which does not need to be
      mechanically processed for long. Therefore, this leads to the
      formation of plaque, commonly in yellow or brown color.<br>
      <br>
      Plaque is a common occurrence these days, and it is easily removed
      by your dentist, but these procedures are extremely expensive.
      However, there is also a natural way to remove the unpleasant
      plaque at your home, entirely painlessly!<br>
      <br>
      This is what should you do:<br>
      <br>
      You need to take several <b>walnut shells</b> and leave them to
      simmer in water for around 20 minutes. Then, leave them until the
      water is cool, and strain.<br>
      The fluid that has remained is your miraculous remedy!<br>
      <br>
      Use it to brush your teeth three times during the day, and you
      will effectively remove tartar and plaque in only two weeks!
      What’s more, it is also useful in the case of bleeding gums, as it
      cures the inflammation due to its powerful antibacterial
      properties.<br>
      Furthermore, note that you need to pay attention to the oral
      hygiene. Namely, you will reduce tooth plaque if you brush the
      teeth regularly and in a proper way.<br>
      <br>
      In contrast, you may experience serious teeth issue, like
      periodontitis, a severe inflammatory disease. If the infection is
      not treated on time, it may penetrate into the root canal and
      cause inflammation of the entire tissue.<br>

        <b>METHOD FOR EQUIVALENTLY CONVERTING MATERIAL TO TACHYON</b></div>
      <br>
      <br>
      Inventor(s): &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MATSUDA HIROYUKI&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      PURPOSE:To make it possible to equivalently convert material to
      tachyon by interaction between coherent material wave and material
      constituting particles at a super high relative speed.
      CONSTITUTION:With a static magnetic field or variable magnetic
      field generator, high frequency alternating magnetic field or a
      high frequency pulse generator, a nuclear magnetic resonance
      device is constituted. Nuclear magnet caused by nuclear spin of a
      material is excited by nuclear magnetic resonance, and by matching
      the periods and phases of precession, material wave also becomes
      coherent. Nuclei in the gravity center of mass of atoms are
      excited by the nuclear magnetic resonance principle and the
      periods and phases of precession are matched. The precession with
      the same period and phase are accompanied with coherent material
      wave. Due to the interaction of the material wave and material
      particles in super high relative speed, a material is equivalently
      takion converted.<br>
      <br>
      [0001] The present invention is by electromagnetic means, it is a
      method of equivalently Tachyon the substance in the interaction by
      superluminal relative velocity of the material and matter waves.
      By TACHYON the material, can be in all areas material utilizing an
      effect according to the law of tachyon beyond physical laws.<br>
      <br>
      [0002] The method of equivalently Tachyon the (Japanese Patent
      Application No. 5-45630) Substance of the Prior Art] prior
      application, the charged particles that make up the substance,
      that is the nucleus, and the extranuclear electron, ultra-light
      speed electromagnetic waves it is due to the interaction with
      ultra-light speed relative speed of the power line.<br>
      <br>
      [0003] The present invention is to provide a in a different
      principle in accordance with another of the superluminal wave in
      place of the electromagnetic wave of ultra-light speed, which is
      intended to be equivalent to Tachyon the substance.<br>
      [0004]<br>
      <br>
      [0004] in the energy wave of ultra-light speed SUMMARY OF THE
      INVENTION The use of the matter wave (de Broglie wave). Phase
      velocity of matter wave is essentially, an ultra-light speed. And
      coherent matter waves due to the mass and speed of the charged
      particles that make up the material by electromagnetic means, in
      the interaction by the constituent particles and superluminal
      relative speed of the material, to equivalently Tachyon the
      substance.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] [action] As is known in the nuclear magnetic resonance
      spectroscopy (NMR), to act a magnetic field to the substance, it
      occurs division of the energy state by the magnetism of atomic
      nuclei spin, become ground state and an excited state. Ground
      state excited state nuclear magnetic arranged in the direction of
      the magnetic field is nuclear magnets are arranged in the opposite
      direction of the magnetic field, precess period determined by the
      intensity of the nuclear type and the magnetic field. It gives a
      high-frequency alternating magnetic field in the direction
      perpendicular to the magnetic field as a continuous or pulsed, and
      resonating the precession of nuclear magnetic nuclear ground state
      becomes higher unstable excited state energy is excited. Nuclei
      excited states in phase aligned performs precession period
      determined by the type of magnetic field strength, and nuclear.
      Precession of uniform nucleus of the phase is accompanied by a
      coherent matter waves.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] The mass of the nucleus is accounted for the majority
      (99.95% or more) of the atomic mass, precession of the nucleus is
      accompanied by matter waves that depends only on the mass and
      velocity of microscopic particles. Matter wave is necessary to
      align the wavelength and phase, incoherent waves wave is canceled
      as a whole each other and randomly interfere with each other to
      disappear. By phase velocity of the material waves are inherently
      superluminal, the material component particles, the relative
      velocity of the material waves are superluminal. And coherent
      matter waves, to equivalently Tachyon the substance in the
      interaction by superluminal relative velocity of the material
      particles.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] [Example 1] acts a static magnetic field or variable
      magnetic field, the sample material, causing the Zeeman splitting
      of the energy state by the magnetic properties of atomic nuclei
      spin. Act a high-frequency alternating magnetic field in the
      direction perpendicular to the magnetic field, exciting the nuclei
      magnets ground state by an electromagnetic wave of the resonance
      frequency of the nuclei. Nuclear magnetic performs precession
      period determined by the type and the magnetic field intensity of
      the nucleus are arranged in the magnetic field direction different
      (90 ° or 180 ° reverse) phase of the excited state are aligned.
      Same cycle, precession of nuclear magnets in phase involves
      coherent matter waves. Phase velocity of coherent matter wave is a
      super-light speed, and the substance constituent particles, to
      equivalently Tachyon the substance in the interaction by
      superluminal relative velocity of matter waves.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] [Example 2] acts a static magnetic field or variable
      magnetic field, the sample material, act repeatedly a
      high-frequency pulse in a direction perpendicular to the magnetic
      field at the same time, the core of the magnet to the excited
      state by magnetic resonance.<br>
      <br>
      [0009], according to the present invention by equivalently Tachyon
      the substance, which express the effect of substance or object is
      in accordance with the law of the tachyon. That is, gravity,
      energy, time, space, in such, a new effect that exceeds the limits
      of physical laws, physically impossible and road also becomes
      possible to be is opened, advantageous use in all areas It can be
      considered. <br>

      Do you remember all the hopes Americans had for Obama when we
      elected him to his first term? Painful memories. He betrayed the
      voters on every one of his promises. There was no change, except
      for the worst as Obama went on to become one of the most vicious
      war criminals in world history. Despite his horrific record, we
      re-elected him, only to have US economic policy turn against the
      people in order to bail out at our expense the mega-banks and the
      One Percent.<br>
      <br>
      Now Obama is coercing Asia and Europe to turn the governments of
      their countries over to rapacious American corporations empowered
      by TPP and TTIP to subordinate all interests to their profits.<br>
      <br>
      Here is Pepe Escobar on how the great and wonderful United States
      treats its enserfed vassals: “Hardball, predictably, is the name
      of the game. Washington no less than threatened to block EU car
      exports [to the US] to force the EU to buy [Monsanto’s]
      genetically engineered fruits and vegetables.” <b><a

      Now we face the prospect of electing an even worse president than
      Obama — Killary Clinton. Killary is the bought-and-paid-for
      property of Wall Street, Israel, and the military-security
      complex. She will bring back to power the totally discredited
      neoconservatives, and the US will proceed with its butchery and
      slaughter of other countries and all reformist governments
      everywhere.<br>
      <br>
      The question is: will enough insouciant Americans align with the
      One Percent, the neocons, the men-hating feminists, homosexuals,
      the transgendered, and other “preferred minorities” to put the US
      presidency in the hands of an aggressive, corrupt person with a
      conscience deficit? That is the goal toward which the presstitutes
      are driving the brainwashed.<br>
      <br>
      If we end up with Killary, neither the US nor the world will
      survive the mistake. She will be the last American president.<br>
      <br>
      Killary is compromised with secret agendas, and secret agendas
      lead to conflict and war. With a crazed President Killary who
      declared Russian Presient Vladimir Putin, the world’s leading
      peacemaker, to be “the new Hitler,” with crazed American generals
      who declare Russia to be “an existential threat to the United
      States,” and with the insane neoconservatives back in the saddle
      determined to impose American hegemony on the rest of the world,
      Killary’s election will terminate life on earth.<br>

        </big></div>
      <br>
      Scientists in China are reporting development of a less expensive,
      more eco-friendly method for making deuterium-depleted drinking
      water, citing studies suggesting that it may be a more healthful
      form of water. Their report appears in ACS’ bi-weekly journal
      Industrial &amp; Engineering Chemistry Research.<br>
      <br>
      Changgong Meng and Feng Huang note that natural water, widely
      known as H2O, actually is a mixture of H2O and tiny amounts of D2O
      — about 150 parts per million (ppm), or a few drops of D2O in
      every quart of water. Deuterium-depleted water usually contains
      about 125 ppm. The “D” is deuterium, an isotope or variant form of
      hydrogen often termed “heavy hydrogen.” They cite accumulating
      evidence that water with high levels of deuterium may have adverse
      health effects on animals and plants, while deuterium-depleted
      water may be useful in treatment of certain diseases. Existing
      ways of removing deuterium from water tend to be expensive,
      inefficient, or environmentally harmful.<br>
      <br>
      They describe a new method that helps overcome these problems, and
      could be the basis for the first industrial-scale production of
      deuterium-depleted water. It involves a platinum catalyst that
      quickly and efficiently removes deuterium from water using a
      combination of cold and hot temperatures. In laboratory-scale
      tests, the new technique reduced the amount of deuterium in water
      from about 145 parts per million to 125 parts per million. The
      resulting water is suitable for drinking, the scientists say, and
      could be produced in large quantities at economical cost.<br>

      <b>Abstract</b><br>
      <br>
      A study of the utilization of dual-temperature catalytic exchange
      between water and hydrogen for the production of
      deuterium-depleted water is presented. We use a novel catalyst
      with excellent physical properties for the hot tower of the
      isotopic exchange. The deuterium-depleted water obtained from the
      experiment is in agreement with the theoretical consideration on
      deuterium content at 80 °C when λ is about 1.5. The
      deuterium-depleted water with 126.3 ppm D2O is gained when λ is
      about 2 under 80 °C. This kind of water can be used as ordinary
      drinking water and in cosmetic and hygiene products.<br>

      <div align="center"><b>Did Scientists Stumble on a Battery that
          Lasts Forever?</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Researchers studying nanowires have found a battery material that
      can be recharged for years, even decades<br>
      <br>
      Imagine a battery that could be recharged for decades. No more
      getting rid of cell phones because of waning battery life. No more
      landfills filled with lithium ion batteries.<br>
      <br>
      This is one step closer to reality, thanks to work by researchers
      from the University of California at Irvine.<br>
      <br>
      The discovery that could lead to ultra-long-life batteries
      happened by serendipity. A team of researchers led by Reginald
      Penner, chair of the university’s chemistry department, had been
      studying nanowires, tiny conductive wires that show great promise
      for use in batteries. The problem is nanowires are fragile and
      generally begin to fray and crack after a certain number of
      charging cycles.<br>
      <br>
      One day, Mya Le Thai, a PhD candidate in Penner’s lab, decided on
      a whim to switch the liquid electrolyte surrounding the nanowire
      assembly with a gel version.<br>
      <br>
      “She started to cycle these gel capacitors, and that’s when we got
      the surprise,” Penner recalls. “She said, ‘this thing has been
      cycling 10,000 cycles and it’s still going.’ She came back a few
      days later and said 'it’s been cycling for 30,000 cycles.' That
      kept going on for a month.”<br>
      <br>
      The team realized they had something special on their hands. While
      they’re still not certain why using a gel electrolyte seems to
      keep the nanowires from breaking down, they have a hypothesis. The
      gel, Penner explains, is about as thick as peanut butter. The
      nanowires, which are hundreds of times thinner than human hair and
      made of manganese oxide, are 80 percent porous. Over time, the
      thick gel slowly seeps into the pores in the nanowires and makes
      them softer. This softness reduces their fragility.<br>
      <br>
      “After 5,000 cycles with normal liquid, [the nanowires] start to
      break,” Penner says. “And then they start to fall off. None of
      that is happening in the gel.”<br>
      <br>
      Right now, the team is working to test this hypothesis. If it’s
      correct, they’ll continue to experiment with different types of
      materials and gels to see what works best. Should the work hold
      up, the gel-wrapped nanowires could eventually be a component in
      ultra-long-lasting batteries. This is likely several years down
      the road, Penner says, though he has been fielding calls from
      companies interested in his lab’s creation.<br>
      <br>
      “The big picture is that there may be a very simple way to
      stabilize nanowires of the type that we studied,” Penner says. “If
      this turns out to be generally true, it would be a great advance
      for the community.”<br>
      <br>
      Since most household electronics have life spans limited by
      factors besides battery life, a battery that lasts for a decade or
      two could easily outlive the device it powers.<br>
      <br>
      “If you could get 100,000 cycles out of a lithium ion battery it
      might mean you never need to buy two of them,” Penner says. “We’re
      talking about a lifetime of 20 years, maybe even longer than

      </b><b>Abstract</b><br>
      <br>
      Earth-abundant first-row (3d) transition-metal-based catalysts
      have been developed for the oxygen-evolution reaction (OER);
      however, they operate at overpotentials significantly above
      thermodynamic requirements. Density functional theory suggested
      that non-3d high-valency metals such as tungsten can modulate 3d
      metal oxides, providing near-optimal adsorption energies for OER
      intermediates. We developed a room-temperature synthesis to
      produce gelled oxy-hydroxide materials with an atomically
      homogeneous metal distribution. These gelled FeCoW oxy-hydroxide
      exhibits the lowest overpotential (191 mV) reported at 10 mA per
      square centimeter in alkaline electrolyte. The catalyst shows no
      evidence of degradation following more than 500 hours of
      operation. X-ray absorption and computational studies reveal a
      synergistic interplay between W, Fe and Co in producing a
      favorable local coordination environment and electronic structure
      that enhance the energetics for OER.<br>

      Bioviva, announced today that she has become the first human
      “successfully rejuvenated by gene therapy.” Using two proprietary
      processes, Parrish claims to have reversed two decades worth of

      cell replications in the vast majority of living things. Telomere
      scores — measured using white blood cells — indicate that Parrish,
      who was 44 years old in September, has slowed a cellular process
      many scientists believe to be one of the root causes of aging....<br>

            NASA's ultra-black paint look like it’s not even black</b></big><br>
        <br>
        <b>by</b><br>

        <b>Rebecca Harrington, Tech Insider</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      The paint used on the Hubble telescope is one of the blackest
      materials in space. It's there to reduce stray light so the
      instrument can photograph the best possible images of our solar
      system and beyond.<br>
      <br>
      But researchers from British company Surrey NanoSystems have made
      something much, much blacker.<br>
      <br>
      Their material, awesomely called Vantablack, is so black that they
      can't even measure how dark it is.<br>
      <br>
      They've posted a YouTube video comparing their creation to the
      Hubble paint, called Aeroglaze Z306.<br>
      <br>
      Vantablack makes Aeroglaze look like it's not even black. When the
      researchers shine a light on the two, you can see the Hubble paint
      reflecting light back, but not Vantablack:<br>
      <br>
      The same thing happens when they shine a red laser on the two
      materials:<br>
      <br>
      Vantablack absorbs almost all of the light, reflecting nothing
      detectable back to our eyes. It's made by tightly packing carbon
      nanotubes — rods of carbon that are much, much thinner than any
      human hair — so close together that light goes in, but can't
      escape.<br>
      <br>
      Surrey NanoSystems has tested Vantablack to see if it could
      withstand going into space, so maybe the material could replace
      Aeroglaze on the next space telescope.<br>
      <br>
      They've also turned Vantablack into a spray paint that captures
      99.8% of light (slightly lower than Vantablack's 99.965%). You
      can't find it on store shelves, though: The spray paint is
      currently only available through the company's processing center
      in the UK.<br>

      Alta Devices is (em)Powering the Unplugged WorldTM by delivering
      the world’s most efficient, thin and flexible mobile power
      technology. By converting light of any kind into electricity, Alta
      Devices’ AnyLightTM power technology extends the energy source of
      a system, and in many cases, completely cuts the traditional power
      cord.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Thin, Flexible and Lightweight</b><br>
      <b> </b><br>
      We begin by growing a thin layer of GaAs on top of a single
      crystal GaAs wafer using a high throughput metalorganic chemical
      vapor deposition (MOCVD) process. We then remove this thin layer
      via an epitaxial lift-off (ELO) process which leaves a thin,
      flexible, and lightweight solar cell.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Mass Production</b><br>
      <b> </b><br>
      Alta Devices houses three unique tools that allow for the mass
      production of thin film GaAs.<br>
      <br>
      First, our metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) tool
      allows for the simultaneous growth of thin GaAs film on top of our
      single crystal GaAs wafers. Process time for the MOCVD tool is
      measured in minutes and the tool is capable of producing hundreds
      of watts of solar cells per hour.<br>
      <br>
      Second, our Epitaxial Lift Off (ELO) tool is the largest of its
      kind in the world and allows for the separation of the GaAs film
      from the wafer.<br>
      <br>
      Last, our matrix assembly tool allows us to build customized solar
      modules to match customer power requirements.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Record Breaking Efficiencies</b><br>
      <b> </b><br>
      In addition to being a direct band gap material, we are able to
      achieve our record breaking efficiencies through the observed
      phenomenon called “Photon Recycling”. In this process photons
      bounce off the back of the solar cell which allows them to be
      recaptured by the material and converted to electricity. Thus,
      more energy is captured where it would have been lost using
      traditional solar technology.<br>

      Human life begins in bright flash of light as a sperm meets an
      egg, scientists have shown for the first time, after capturing the
      astonishing ‘fireworks’ on film.<br>
      <br>
      An explosion of tiny sparks erupts from the egg at the exact
      moment of conception.<br>
      <br>
      Scientists had seen the phenomenon occur in other animals but it
      is the first time is has been also shown to happen in humans.<br>
      <br>
      “To see the zinc radiate out in a burst from each human egg was
      breathtaking.” -- Professor Teresa Woodruff, Northwestern
      University<br>
      <br>
      Not only is it an incredible spectacle, highlighting the very
      moment that a new life begins, the size of the flash can be used
      to determine the quality of the fertilised egg.<br>
      <br>
      Researchers from Northwestern University, in Chicago, noticed that
      some of the eggs burn brighter than others, showing that they are
      more likely to produce a healthy baby.<br>

      <br>
      The discovery could help fertility doctors pick the best
      fertilised eggs to transfer during in vitro fertilisation (IVF).<br>
      <br>
      “It was remarkable,” said Professor Teresa Woodruff, one of the
      study’s two senior authors and an expert in ovarian biology at
      Northwestern.<br>
      <br>
      “We discovered the zinc spark just five years ago in the mouse,
      and to see the zinc radiate out in a burst from each human egg was
      breathtaking.<br>
      <br>
      “This means if you can look at the zinc spark at the time of
      fertilization, you will know immediately which eggs are the good
      ones to transfer in in vitro fertilization.<br>
      <br>
      “It’s a way of sorting egg quality in a way we’ve never been able
      to assess before. “All of biology starts at the time of
      fertilization, yet we know next to nothing about the events that
      occur in the human.”<br>

      <br>
      Currently around 50 per cent of fertilised eggs do not develop
      properly and experts believe that faulty genetic code could be
      responsible.<br>
      <br>
      Some clinics take videos of the egg developing to try pick up
      problems early, while others check for genetic mutations, but that
      is an invasive procedure which can damage the tiny egg. Often it
      is just down to a clinician decided which eggs look the
      healthiest.<br>
      <br>
      But the new findings could give and extra indication that an egg
      is flourishing. A video of nine human eggs coming into contact
      with sperm enzyme showed two flashed much brighter than the rest.<br>
      <br>
      “This is an important discovery because it may give us a
      non-invasive and easily visible way to assess the health of an egg
      and eventually an embryo before implantation,” said co-author Dr
      Eve Feinberg, who took care of the patients who provided eggs for
      the basic science study and collaborated with the research team. <br>
      <br>
      “There are no tools currently available that tell us if it’s a
      good quality egg. Often we don’t know whether the egg or embryo is
      truly viable until we see if a pregnancy ensues.<br>
      <br>
      “That’s the reason this is so transformative. If we have the
      ability up front to see what is a good egg and what’s not, it will
      help us know which embryo to transfer, avoid a lot of heartache
      and achieve pregnancy much more quickly.”<br>

      <br>
      The bright flash occurs because when sperm enters an egg it leads
      to a surge of calcium which triggers the release of zinc from the
      egg. As the zinc shoots out, it binds to small molecules which
      emit a fluorescence which can be picked up by camera microscopes.<br>
      <br>
      Over the last six years this team has shown that zinc controls the
      decision to grow and change into a completely new genetic
      organism.<br>
      <br>
      In the experiment, scientists use sperm enzyme rather than actual
      sperm to show what happens at the moment of conception.<br>
      <br>
      “These fluorescence microscopy studies establish that the zinc
      spark occurs in human egg biology, and that can be observed
      outside of the cell,” said Professor Tom O’Halloran, a co-senior
      author. <br>
      <br>
      In a companion paper published in Scientific Reports on March 18,
      a zinc spark is shown at the precise time a sperm enters a mouse
      egg.<br>
      <br>
      This discovery was made by Nan Zhang, a postdoctoral fellow at
      Northwestern.&nbsp; Little is known about the events that occur at
      the time of fertilization, because it is difficult to capture the
      precise time of sperm entry.<br>
      <br>
      The study will be published April 26 in Scientific Reports.<br>

            of Human Egg</b><br>

      A stunning explosion of zinc fireworks occurs when a human egg is
      activated by a sperm enzyme, and the size of these “sparks” is a
      direct measure of the quality of the egg and its ability to
      develop into an embryo, according to new research from
      Northwestern Medicine. <br>
      <br>
      The discovery has potential to help doctors choose the best eggs
      to transfer during in vitro fertilization (IVF), the scientists
      said. <br>
      <br>
      This is the first time the zinc sparks have been documented in a
      human egg. <br>
      <br>
      “This means if you can look at the zinc spark at the time of
      fertilization, you will know immediately which eggs are the good
      ones to transfer in in vitro fertilization (IVF),” said Teresa
      Woodruff, one of the study’s two senior authors and an expert in
      ovarian biology at Northwestern. “It’s a way of sorting egg
      quality in a way we’ve never been able to assess before.”<br>
      <br>
      Woodruff is the Thomas J. Watkins Memorial Professor in Obstetrics
      and Gynecology at Northwestern University Feinberg School of
      Medicine and director of Northwestern’s Center for Reproductive
      Science. <br>
      <br>
      Scientists activated the egg by injecting a sperm enzyme into the
      egg that triggers calcium to increase within the egg and zinc to
      be released from the egg. (The eggs in the study were not
      fertilized with actual sperm because that is not permitted in
      human research under federal law.)<br>
      <br>
      “It was remarkable,” Woodruff said. “We discovered the zinc spark
      just five years ago in the mouse, and to see the zinc radiate out
      in a burst from each human egg was breathtaking. <br>
      <br>
      “All of biology starts at the time of fertilization, yet we know
      next to nothing about the events that occur in the human. This
      discovery required a unique partnership between biologists and
      chemists and non-federal dollars to support the research,” she
      said. <br>
      <br>
      The study was published April 26 in Scientific Reports.<br>
      <br>
      As the zinc is released from the egg, it binds to small molecule
      probes, which emit light in fluorescence microscopy experiments.
      Thus the rapid zinc release can be followed as a flash of light
      that appears as a spark. <br>
      <br>
      “These fluorescence microscopy studies establish that the zinc
      spark occurs in human egg biology, and that can be observed
      outside of the cell,” said Tom O’Halloran, a co-senior
      author.&nbsp; O’Halloran is the Charles E. and Emma H. Morrison
      Professor in Chemistry in the Weinberg College of Arts and
      Sciences and director of Northwestern’s Chemistry of Life

      “I believe that these extraterrestrial vehicles and their crews

      little more technically advanced than we are here on Earth.” –
      Colonel Gordon Cooper<br>

      “I happen to be privileged enough to be in on the fact that we
      have been visited on this planet and the UFO phenomenon is real.
      It has been covered up by governments for quite some time now.” –
      Captain Edgar Mitchell<br>
      <br>
      “There is abundant evidence that we are being contacted, that
      civilizations have been visiting us for a very long time.”- Dr.
      Brian O’Leary<br>
      <br>
      “On two of my missions, and I still don’t have an answer, I have
      seen a snake out there, 6, 7, 8 feet long, it is rubbery because
      it has internal waves in it and it follows you for a rather long
      period of time. The more you fly in space the more you see an
      incredible amount of things out there and that sort of brings to
      you, really a certainty that some living creatures are out there.”
      – Story Musgrave, M.D. .<br>
      <br>
      “Yes, during my flight in Gemini 64 I saw an object in space,
      fairly close to our spacecraft that I could not identify. […] All
      of our ground tracking data indicated that there shouldn’t have
      been an object anywhere near us at the time. […] I know all kinds
      people who have claim to have seen [UFOs] , some of them are very
      legitimate.” – Brigadier General James McDivitt<br>
      <br>
      “It looked like a saucer sitting on an edge, about a 45 degree
      angle. […] What ever it was, for what ever reason, just took
      off&nbsp; climbing at about a 45 degree angle.. and just
      accelerated and just disappeared. I obviously couldn’t follow it
      with an old piston engine fighter.” – Major Donald K. Slayton .<br>
      <br>
      “I saw next to us, about one and a half kilometers away, and about
      1000 meters higher. There is a flying object, it’s shape is a
      perfect right triangle. It was white, a very bright white. I am a
      pilot, a fighter pilot and know many different type of flying
      aircraft. It was like nothing I have ever seen. [Voice over:]
      ‘Ground control could not detect any objects even though the
      object could be seen by all occupants in the plane.’ It traveled a
      parallel course, and it’s speed — if we were traveling approx.
      1000 kph, it was traveling about 1500 kph, because it&nbsp; passed
      us rather quickly. In about 30-40 seconds it passed by and
      overtook us.” – Major General Pavel Popovich.<br>
      <br>
      “On May 5, 1981, we were in orbit. I saw an object that didn’t
      resemble any cosmic objects I’m familiar with. It was a round
      object which resembled a melon, round and a little bit elongated.
      In front of this object was something that resembled a gyrating
      depressed cone, I can draw it, it’s difficult to describe. The
      object resembles a barbell. I saw it becoming transparent and like
      with a ‘body’ inside. At the other end I saw something like gas
      discharging, like a reactive object. Then something happened that
      is very difficult for me to describe from the point of view of
      physics. I have to recognize that it did not have an artificial
      origin. It was not artificial because an artificial object
      couldn’t attain this form. I don’t know of anything that can make
      this movement.. tightening, then expanding, pulsating. Then as I
      was observing something happened, two explosions. One explosion,
      and then 0.5 seconds later, the second part exploded. I called my
      colleague Viktor [Savinykh], but he didn’t arrive in time to see
      anything.” – Major-General Vladimir Kovalenok.<br>
      <br>
      “I think we are not alone in the universe, I belief that someone
      or something of Extra-Terrestrial origin visited earth. [Voice
      over:]&nbsp; ‘Cosmonaut Victor Afanasyev saw an Unidentified
      Flying Object turn towards his craft and began tailing it through
      space.’ It followed us half of our orbit. We observed it on the
      light side, and when we entered the shadow side it disappeared
      completely. It was an engineering structure, made from some kind
      of metal, approx 40 meters long with inner holes, the object was
      nearer here and bigger here. Some places had projections like
      small wings. The object stayed very close to us. We photographed
      it. Our photos showed it to be 23 to 28 meters away.” [Voice
      over:] ‘When the cosmonaut returned to earth he was debriefed,
      told never to reveal anything he knew and had his cameras and film
      confescated. Those photos and voice transmissions have never been
      released.’ – Hero of the Soviet Union Viktor Afanasyev .<br>
      <br>
      “I saw something that looked it had broken off the ship, besides
      that the object was spinning as it was moving away and the
      intensity of the shine changed. I can’t really tell how distant it
      was. I can only say it wasn’t close, because the camera was
      adjusted to infinity. After I examined the ship, I realized that
      there was nothing that could have separated, also no alarm went
      off, everything was calm.” – Colonel Musa Manarov <br>

        <i>Dept. of Finance/Judge Lodge Linked to Hansen Nightmare </i><i><br>
        </i> <br>
        <b>By Investigative Reporter Edward Snook of the Oregon Observer</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      In the March edition of The Oregon Observer we informed our
      readership of the accomplishments made on behalf of all Americans
      by Congressman George Hansen. The following article tells how a
      criminally corrupt Federal Judge by the name of Edward Lodge with
      the help of numerous other Federal and State accomplices repaid
      Hansen for all of his efforts.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Diesel Therapy</b><br>
      <br>
      Diesel therapy - a prison term reserved for the most inhumane,
      degrading and painful of punishment; normally reserved for the
      most violent and uncontrollable of prisoners.<br>
      <br>
      A prisoner is shackled at the feet and handcuffed at the wrists,
      reinforced with a box-like structure which stiffens the chains and
      locks the wrists at a 90-degree angle. The handcuffs are connected
      to a waist chain that is connected to another chain which connects
      the shackles. Once this shackling is complete, a prisoner can
      barely move. The tightened manacles pinch the nerves and restrict
      the flow of blood causing severe pain and swelling. Legs swelling
      with blood are particularly damaging to the feet, as toenails
      under pressure from blood-blisters press up against shoes for long
      periods of time and soon become infected and deformed, causing
      such excruciating pain that they require surgery or the pulling of
      the toenails out by the roots.<br>
      <br>
      Diesel therapy gets its name, not from the "cruel and unusual"
      bondage, but from being forced into bus after bus and onto plane
      after plane, shackled as described, and being shuttled from one
      prison to another, for weeks on end, 20 hours per day in chains,
      for no other reason than to cause pain and suffering and give the
      prisoner a "message."<br>
      <br>
      Welcome to diesel therapy and the world of seven-term Congressman
      George Hansen who was found guilty in the court-room of the
      infamous Federal Judge Edward Lodge on bogus charges of bank fraud
      which were manipulated into an issue by the Idaho Department of
      Finance illegally using the same agents previously employed by the
      IRS in their failed attempt to quote "get Hansen."<br>
      <br>
      People who have been reading past editions of The Idaho Observer
      and The Oregon Observer will recall that the Judge Lodge/Idaho
      Department of Finance connection has already been uncovered in the
      bogus securities laws violations charges levied against Boise
      businessman and winemaker Petro (Pete) Eliopulos, who said; "After
      Ed Snook of The Oregon Observer and I met with Hansen and he told
      me in a six-hour meeting what had happened to him, I was more
      shaken than I have ever been in my life. If (West One) bank
      officers Knox and Neaville had not subsequently been convicted of
      crimes which came to light in the bogus investigations of me and
      my businesses, they could have done to me what they did to
      Hansen," said Eliopulos, who was shocked that a U.S.
      Representative, or anybody for that matter, could be treated this
      way in America.<br>
      <br>
      What could an esteemed member of the U.S. Congress have done to
      deserve such treatment?<br>
      <br>
      <b>Congressman Hansen Found Innocent</b><br>
      <br>
      After four years of imprisonment, after ten years of persecution,
      after being ruined professionally and financially and after being
      permanently damaged physically, in December, 1995, the 9th Circuit
      Court of Appeals vacated Hansen's sentence for bank fraud because
      the U.S. Supreme Court had ruled on May 15 that Hansen's previous
      conviction as a member of Congress had been overturned.<br>
      <br>
      But it should be known that Judge Lodge saw to it that Hansen got
      "diesel therapy" coming and going to prison from the Judge's court
      at great cost to the government, even though Hansen should have
      been allowed to make such trips at his own expense. On the way
      from his hometown of Pocatello to federal prison in Petersberg, VA
      , Hansen was bussed and flown, nearly immovably shackled, at
      taxpayer expense, to jails all over the country. Not Hansen's
      lawyer, his wife, nor his allies in Congress were able to locate
      him. Hansen had simply disappeared for a month into the custody of
      the Federal Marshal's Service. Hansen's wife didn't know whether
      he was dead or alive. And even when the Supreme Court overturned
      Hansen's original case and the Appeals Court vacated his current
      sentence, Hansen still got the Judge Lodge treatment of another
      dose of diesel therapy from Virginia back to Idaho.<br>
      <br>
      What had Hansen, who was a model prisoner, done to deserve the
      most brutal, torturous and barbaric type of treatment this
      country's penal system is capable of inflicting on a prisoner? The
      answer is obvious: Hansen is Americas most famous political
      prisoner.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Congressional Accountability Project (CAP)</b><br>
      <b> </b><br>
      Retired Congressman Tom Kindness (R-Ohio) stated , "I believe that
      George's recent trial and conviction on charges of "bank fraud"
      was the direct result of a campaign by various members of the
      bureaucracy to stop the CAP."<br>
      <br>
      CAP, the Congressional Accountability Project, was being launched
      by Hansen and a group of investors interested in good government.
      CAP was going to utilize nation-wide television and a national 900
      number to make congresspersons instantaneously accountable to the
      American people for their votes on the House and Senate floors.<br>
      <br>
      "This was a project which would, in my opinion, have had a major
      impact on the votes of congressmen since it would have made them
      instantaneously responsible to the people by making their votes
      known immediately after being cast," commented journalist John
      Voss.<br>
      <br>
      Hansen and his associates were on the verge of making CAP fully
      operational and accessible to the American public when the
      government, through the Idaho Department of Finance with the
      illegal help of former IRS agents, a revenge-minded Justice
      Department and the corrupt Judge Lodge, manufactured bank fraud
      charges against him. Court transcripts reflect that justice in
      Judge Lodge's court, where big bank interests are concerned, is
      always compromised in favor of the banks, as has been proven by
      the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in a number of civil court cases.<br>
      <br>
      Judge Lodge's provably compromised court ultimately found Hansen
      guilty and a vengeful Judge Lodge prescribed diesel therapy to
      teach him a lesson.<br>
      <br>
      W<b>hy did the "Honorable" Judge Lodge treat Hansen like Public
        Enemy #1?</b><br>
      <b> </b><br>
      George Hansen was the only member of Congress able to pull the
      strings necessary to visit the hostages in Iran in 1979, exposing
      the big-bank scam behind that crises.<br>
      <br>
      George Hansen was the author of the book To Harass Our People, an
      indictment of the IRS, where he demanded its dismantling.<br>
      <br>
      George Hansen was the congressman who was so outraged by what he
      discovered about the IRS while researching his book that he wrote
      and helped to pass the Taxpayers Bill of Rights.<br>
      <br>
      George Hansen was the first man to propose the flat tax as a
      damage control alternative to protect the people from IRS abuses.<br>
      <br>
      Hansen was the man who took on OSHA, WPPSS, and the INS.<br>
      <br>
      George Hansen was the man who fearlessly and repeatedly made
      public his findings when investigations turned up government
      corruption and citizen abuse.<br>
      <br>
      The "system" decided it had to teach Congressman Hansen a lesson
      because, had he been allowed to continue serving on Capitol Hill,
      he would soon likely be the chairman of the powerful House Banking
      Committee, a fact that history has shown would have happened in
      1995.<br>
      <br>
      So, why did Judge Lodge, whose personal reasons for needing to
      keep the well documented criminal nature of the banking industry
      below public scrutiny, with the help of the Idaho Department of
      Finance, trump up a bank fraud conviction by denying the admission
      of exonerating evidence in court in order to throw Hansen in
      prison and make sure that he was punished severely with diesel
      therapy?<br>
      <br>
      Was it because Congressman Hansen was getting close to the truth
      and accumulating the political power it would take to finally and
      totally expose the banking industry and government for its
      criminal abuse of the American people?<br>
      <br>
      <b>Judge Lodge's Court of Kangaroos</b><br>
      <b> </b><br>
      CAP was apparently the final straw and abusive criminal government
      had to shut Hansen down. On the eve of CAP becoming fully
      operational, powerful special interests and political enemies
      derailed the project and forced a domino effect of financial
      repercussions upon Hansen and his associates. The government then
      took the situation it had created and indicted, prosecuted and
      convicted Hansen of bank fraud. Though the treachery of Judge
      Lodge and the government disdained the patriotic financial
      sacrifices made by Hansens supporters for good government and
      callously prevented his efforts to repay them, it did not prevent
      Hansen from publicly pledging that these law breaking government
      bullies could never seal his lips, nor stop him from somehow
      paying back the people he owed and keeping his word.<br>
      <br>
      "Every attorney who has read the court transcripts is concerned
      and confounded as to how George could have been convicted on bank
      fraud charges when the supervising bank officers were not only
      acutely aware of his financial operation and transactions, but
      were actively assisting him in his efforts for over ten years!
      "George defrauded no one and we can prove it," stated Congressman
      Kindness.<br>
      <br>
      Hansen was not really imprisoned and tortured by "our" government
      for bank fraud, though that was the government's excuse to lock
      him up and shut him down. Hansen was actually a political prisoner
      who was guilty of attempting to provide the American people with
      the ammunition of knowledge so they could successfully fight back
      the senseless encroachment of government oppression which more and
      more is ruining the lives of all of us. Hansen dedicated his civil
      service to facilitating a return of a Constitutional form of
      government which is of, by and for the people and "our" government
      felt threatened enough by his noble activities to see to it that
      he was imprisoned and tortured for daring to tell citizens and
      taxpayers the truth.<br>
      <br>
      Hansen was the only U.S. statesman who cared enough to risk his
      own safety and political career to visit the hostages in Iran in
      1979. While in Iran, Hansen saw first hand what happens to
      political prisoners who were beaten mercilessly, who had finger
      and toe nails ripped out by the roots and who had been shackled
      until they were permanently disabled physically.<br>
      <br>
      Hansen has also experienced first hand the same inhumane torture
      and it happened to him in the most "civilized" nation on earth,
      the only difference being that Hansen was denied treatment and
      pain-killers, and even had to rip his own deformed and infected
      toenails out as part of his punishment for being a defender of the
      people and an exemplary American statesman.<br>
      <br>
      Every state and Federal official with any knowledge of the past
      actions taken against Congressman George Hansen are guilty if they
      haven't spoken out about the crimes which have been committed
      against this truly great American Hero. Our treacherous and
      shameless government is supposedly all concerned with "human
      rights" in places such as China, Cuba, etc., what a joke. After
      realizing what this man has endured for all of us, it isn't too
      hard to see that we have very little real leadership left in this
      "once upon a time great nation." It is however easy to see that we
      have thousands of cowards, thieves and opportunists in high places
      and key positions who have almost paralyzed the dynamics of the
      American dream.<br>
      <br>
      For several months The Oregon Observer has investigated and
      clearly identified how the federal court and legal system has been
      criminally manipulated by corrupted judges and lawyers, powered by
      the greedy and illegal financial manipulations of big banks, to
      smash thousands of people in bankruptcy court, in civil court and
      even in criminal court like the George Hansen nightmare.<br>
      <br>
      The staff of The Oregon Observer will not sleep well until Judge
      Lodge and all other criminals who have taking part in this
      destructive legal assault on the public are in prison, which is
      right where they deserve to be.<br>
      <br>
      Forest Glen Durland asks that you alert your Congress Persons to
      this information. Copies of the article can be obtained from the
      Oregon Observer for a very nominal fee. Forest obtained twenty
      copies of the entire issue and is distributing them to his
      Congressional representatives as well as to local schools and

      “You had to live—did live, from habit that became instinct—in the
      assumption that every sound you made was overheard, and, except in
      darkness, every movement scrutinized.”—George Orwell, 1984<br>
      <br>
      In past ages, those who dared to speak out against tyranny—viewed
      as an act of treason—were blinded, castrated, disfigured,
      mutilated, rendered mute by having their tongues cut out of their
      heads, and ultimately crucified.<br>
      <br>
      In the American police state, the price to be paid for speaking
      truth to power (also increasingly viewed as an act of treason) is
      surveillance, censorship, jail and ultimately death.<br>
      <br>
      It’s a diabolically ingenious tactic for muzzling, disarming and
      ultimately eliminating one’s critics or potential adversaries.<br>
      <br>
      However, where many Americans go wrong is in assuming that you
      have to be doing something illegal or challenging the government’s
      authority in order to be flagged as a suspicious character,
      labeled an enemy of the state and locked up like a dangerous
      criminal.<br>
      <br>
      In fact, as I point out in my book Battlefield America: The War on
      the American People, all you really need to do is use certain
      trigger words, surf the internet, communicate using a cell phone,
      drive a car, stay at a hotel, purchase materials at a hardware
      store, take flying or boating lessons, appear suspicious, question
      government authority, or generally live in the United States.<br>
      <br>
      With the help of automated eyes and ears, a growing arsenal of
      high-tech software, hardware and techniques, government propaganda
      urging Americans to turn into spies and snitches, as well as
      social media and behavior sensing software, government agents are
      spinning a sticky spider-web of threat assessments, behavioral
      sensing warnings, flagged “words,” and “suspicious” activity
      reports aimed at snaring potential enemies of the state.<br>
      <br>
      It’s the American police state’s take on the dystopian terrors
      foreshadowed by George Orwell, Aldous Huxley and Phillip K. Dick
      all rolled up into one oppressive pre-crime and pre-thought crime
      package.<br>
      <br>
      What’s more, the technocrats who run the surveillance state don’t
      even have to break a sweat while monitoring what you say, what you
      read, what you write, where you go, how much you spend, whom you
      support, and with whom you communicate. Computers now do the
      tedious work of trolling social media, the internet, text messages
      and phone calls for potentially anti-government remarks—all of
      which is carefully recorded, documented, and stored to be used
      against you someday at a time and place of the government’s
      choosing.<br>
      <br>
      While this may sound like a riff on a bad joke, it’s a bad joke
      with “we the people” as the punchline. Yet it is no laughing
      matter that Americans are being jailed for growing orchids,
      feeding whales, collecting rainwater, and praying in their
      backyards. There is nothing humorous about Americans having their
      families terrorized by SWAT teams, their pets killed, their
      children shot, their homes trashed and their privacy shredded. And
      there’s really not much comic relief to be found when the
      citizenry is forced to pay their own government to jail, spy on,
      censor, terrorize and kill them.<br>
      <br>
      The following activities are guaranteed to get you censored,
      surveilled, eventually placed on a government watch list, possibly
      detained and potentially killed.<br>
      <br>
      Laugh at your own peril.<br>
      <br>
      Use harmless trigger words like cloud, pork and pirates: The
      Department of Homeland Security has an expansive list of keywords
      and phrases it uses to monitor social networking sites and online
      media for signs of terrorist or other threats. While you’ll
      definitely send up an alert for using phrases such as dirty bomb,
      Jihad and Agro terror, you’re just as likely to get flagged for
      surveillance if you reference the terms SWAT, lockdown, police,
      cloud, food poisoning, pork, flu, Subway, smart, delays,
      cancelled, la familia, pirates, hurricane, forest fire, storm,
      flood, help, ice, snow, worm, warning or social media.<br>
      <br>
      Use a cell phone: Simply by using a cell phone, you make yourself
      an easy target for government agents—working closely with
      corporations—who can listen in on your phone calls, read your text
      messages and emails, and track your movements based on the data
      transferred from, received by, and stored in your cell phone.
      Mention any of the so-called “trigger” words in a conversation or
      text message, and you’ll get flagged for sure.<br>
      <br>
      Drive a car: Unless you’ve got an old junkyard heap without any of
      the gadgets and gizmos that are so attractive to today’s car
      buyers (GPS, satellite radio, electrical everything, smart
      systems, etc.), driving a car today is like wearing a homing
      device: you’ll be tracked from the moment you open that car door
      thanks to black box recorders and vehicle-to-vehicle
      communications systems that can monitor your speed, direction,
      location, the number of miles traveled, and even your seatbelt
      use. Once you add satellites, GPS devices, license plate readers,
      and real-time traffic cameras to the mix, there’s nowhere you can
      go on our nation’s highways and byways that you can’t be followed.
      By the time you add self-driving cars into the futuristic mix,
      equipped with computers that know where you want to go before you
      do, privacy and autonomy will be little more than distant mirages
      in your rearview mirror.<br>
      <br>
      Attend a political rally: Enacted in the wake of 9/11, the Patriot
      Act redefined terrorism so broadly that many non-terrorist
      political activities such as protest marches, demonstrations and
      civil disobedience were considered potential terrorist acts,
      thereby rendering anyone desiring to engage in protected First
      Amendment expressive activities as suspects of the surveillance
      state.<br>
      <br>
      Express yourself on social media: The FBI, CIA, NSA and other
      government agencies are investing in and relying on corporate
      surveillance technologies that can mine constitutionally protected
      speech on social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter and
      Instagram in order to identify potential extremists and predict
      who might engage in future acts of anti-government behavior. A
      decorated Marine, 26-year-old Brandon Raub was targeted by the
      Secret Service because of his Facebook posts, interrogated by
      government agents about his views on government corruption,
      arrested with no warning, labeled mentally ill for subscribing to
      so-called “conspiratorial” views about the government, detained
      against his will in a psych ward for having “dangerous” opinions,
      and isolated from his family, friends and attorneys.<br>
      <br>
      Serve in the military: Operation Vigilant Eagle, the brainchild of
      the Dept. of Homeland Security, calls for surveillance of military
      veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan, characterizing them
      as extremists and potential domestic terrorist threats because
      they may be “disgruntled, disillusioned or suffering from the
      psychological effects of war.” Police agencies are also using
      Beware, an “early warning” computer system that tips them off to a
      potential suspect’s inclination to be a troublemaker and assigns
      individuals a color-coded threat score—green, yellow or red—based
      on a variety of factors including one’s criminal records, military
      background, medical history and social media surveillance.<br>
      <br>
      Disagree with a law enforcement official: A growing number of
      government programs are aimed at identifying, monitoring and
      locking up anyone considered potentially “dangerous” or mentally
      ill (according to government standards, of course). For instance,
      a homeless man in New York City who reportedly had a history of
      violence but no signs of mental illness was forcibly detained in a
      psych ward for a week after arguing with shelter police. Despite
      the fact that doctors cited no medical reason to commit him, the
      man was locked up in accordance with a $22 million program that
      monitors mentally ill people considered “potentially” violent.
      According to the Associated Press, “A judge finally ordered his
      release, ruling that the man's commitment violated his civil
      rights and that bureaucrats had meddled in his medical treatment.”<br>
      <br>
      Call in sick to work: In Virginia, a so-called police “welfare
      check” instigated by a 58-year-old man’s employer after he called
      in sick resulted in a two-hour, SWAT team-style raid on the man’s
      truck and a 72-hour mental health hold. During the standoff, a
      heavily armed police tactical team confronted Benjamin Burruss as
      he was leaving an area motel, surrounded his truck, deployed a
      “stinger” device behind the rear tires, launched a flash grenade,
      smashed the side window in order to drag him from the truck,
      handcuffed and searched him, and transported him to a local
      hospital for a psychiatric evaluation and mental health hold. All
      of this was done despite the fact that police acknowledged they
      had no legal basis nor probable cause for detaining Burruss, given
      that he had not threatened to harm anyone and was not mentally
      ill.<br>
      <br>
      Limp or stutter: As a result of a nationwide push to certify a
      broad spectrum of government officials in mental health first-aid
      training (a 12-hour course comprised of PowerPoint presentations,
      videos, discussions, role playing and other interactive
      activities), more Americans are going to run the risk of being
      reported for having mental health issues by non-medical personnel.
      Mind you, once you get on such a government watch list—whether
      it’s a terrorist watch list, a mental health watch list, or a
      dissident watch list—there’s no clear-cut way to get off, whether
      or not you should actually be on there. For instance, one
      37-year-old disabled man was arrested, diagnosed by police and an
      unlicensed mental health screener as having “mental health
      issues,” apparently because of his slurred speech and unsteady
      gait, and subsequently locked up for five days in a mental health
      facility against his will and with no access to family and
      friends. A subsequent hearing found that Gordon Goines, who
      suffers from a neurological condition similar to multiple
      sclerosis, has no mental illness and should not have been
      confined.<br>
      <br>
      Appear confused or nervous, fidget, whistle or smell bad:
      According to the Transportation Security Administration’s 92-point
      secret behavior watch list for spotting terrorists, these are
      among some of the telling signs of suspicious behavior: fidgeting,
      whistling, bad body odor, yawning, clearing your throat, having a
      pale face from recently shaving your beard, covering your mouth
      with your hand when speaking and blinking your eyes fast. You can
      also be pulled aside for interrogation if you “have ‘unusual
      items,’ like almanacs and ‘numerous prepaid calling cards or cell
      phones.’” One critic of the program accurately referred to the
      program as a “license to harass.”<br>
      <br>
      Allow yourself to be seen in public waving a toy gun or anything
      remotely resembling a gun, such as a water nozzle or a remote
      control or a walking cane, for instance: No longer is it unusual
      to hear about incidents in which police shoot unarmed individuals
      first and ask questions later. John Crawford was shot by police in
      an Ohio Wal-Mart for holding an air rifle sold in the store that
      he may have intended to buy. Thirteen-year-old Andy Lopez Cruz was
      shot 7 times in 10 seconds by a California police officer who
      mistook the boy’s toy gun for an assault rifle. Christopher Roupe,
      17, was shot and killed after opening the door to a police
      officer. The officer, mistaking the Wii remote control in Roupe’s
      hand for a gun, shot him in the chest. Another police officer
      repeatedly shot 70-year-old Bobby Canipe during a traffic stop.
      The cop saw the man reaching for his cane and, believing the cane
      to be a rifle, opened fire.<br>
      <br>
      Stare at a police officer: Miami-Dade police slammed the
      14-year-old Tremaine McMillian to the ground, putting him in a
      chokehold and handcuffing him after he allegedly gave them
      “dehumanizing stares” and walked away from them, which the
      officers found unacceptable.<br>
      <br>
      Appear to be pro-gun, pro-freedom or anti-government: You might be
      a domestic terrorist in the eyes of the FBI (and its network of
      snitches) if you: express libertarian philosophies (statements,
      bumper stickers); exhibit Second Amendment-oriented views (NRA or
      gun club membership); read survivalist literature, including
      apocalyptic fictional books; show signs of self-sufficiency
      (stockpiling food, ammo, hand tools, medical supplies); fear an
      economic collapse; buy gold and barter items; subscribe to
      religious views concerning the book of Revelation; voice fears
      about Big Brother or big government; expound about constitutional
      rights and civil liberties; or believe in a New World Order
      conspiracy. This is all part of a larger trend in American
      governance whereby dissent is criminalized and pathologized, and
      dissenters are censored, silenced or declared unfit for society. <br>
      <br>
      Attend a public school: Microcosms of the police state, America’s
      public schools contain almost every aspect of the militarized,
      intolerant, senseless, overcriminalized, legalistic,
      surveillance-riddled, totalitarian landscape that plagues those of
      us on the “outside.” From the moment a child enters one of the
      nation’s 98,000 public schools to the moment she graduates, she
      will be exposed to a steady diet of draconian zero tolerance
      policies that criminalize childish behavior, overreaching
      anti-bullying statutes that criminalize speech, school resource
      officers (police) tasked with disciplining and/or arresting
      so-called “disorderly” students, standardized testing that
      emphasizes rote answers over critical thinking, politically
      correct mindsets that teach young people to censor themselves and
      those around them, and extensive biometric and surveillance
      systems that, coupled with the rest, acclimate young people to a
      world in which they have no freedom of thought, speech or
      movement. Additionally, as part of the government’s so-called
      ongoing war on terror, the FBI—the nation’s de facto secret police
      force—is now recruiting students and teachers to spy on each other
      and report anyone who appears to have the potential to be
      “anti-government” or “extremist” as part of its “Don’t Be a
      Puppet” campaign.<br>
      <br>
      Speak truth to power: Long before Chelsea Manning and Edward
      Snowden were being castigated for blowing the whistle on the
      government’s war crimes and the National Security Agency’s abuse
      of its surveillance powers, it was activists such as Martin Luther
      King Jr. and John Lennon who were being singled out for daring to
      speak truth to power. These men and others like them had their
      phone calls monitored and data files collected on their activities
      and associations. For a little while, at least, they became enemy
      number one in the eyes of the U.S. government.<br>
      <br>
      There’s always a price to pay for standing up to the
      powers-that-be.<br>
      <br>
      Yet as this list shows, you don’t even have to be a dissident to
      get flagged by the government for surveillance, censorship and
      detention.<br>
      <br>
      All you really need to be is a citizen of the American police
      state.<br>
