        </b>You may have vaguely noticed it on the shelf of your
        favorite supplement source and perhaps it didn’t register as
        anything worthwhile. That’s because it has never been advertised
        or promoted openly due to FDA restrictions that won’t permit any
        positive health effects promoted from natural products. Only
        toxic chemicals are allowed to promote healing qualities.<br>
        <br>
        Grapefruit seed extract (GSE) is usually on supplement shelves
        under the trade name Nutribiotic GSE. It’s usually a liquid
        concentrate in a squeeze bottle, and it’s not expensive, doesn’t
        run out quickly, and has a long shelf life….<br>
        <br>
        <b>Medical Testimony and Research</b><br>
        <br>
        “After many years of treating patients with thrush and
        intestinal Candidiasis, I have found Citricidal (GSE) to be very
        effective. It is easier to modulate the dose than other
        anti-yeast products, as there is no bad after-taste. The liquid
        Citricidal is excellent for administering to babies and
        children. Efficacy compares with nystatin and GSE is less
        expensive.” – Dr. David Bayley, N.D. North Vancouver, BC.<br>
        <br>
        A University of Georgia GSE study by microbiologist Roger Wyatt,
        PhD determined:<br>
        <br>
        In view of the reports that we have discussed, the wide spectrum
        of activity that (GSE) offers (antiviral, antibacterial; Gram+
        and Gram-, antimycotic, and antiprotozoan) will undoubtedly aid
        in its acceptability. The lack of any significant toxicological
        properties of (GSE) is also impressive when one views the
        efficacy data where extemely small concentrations of the product
        can be used with marked beneficial results.<br>
        <br>
        Dr. Leo Galland of New York City reported that he had prescribed
        GSE for Candida and yeast infections to 297 patients. Only two
        failed to achieve satisfactory results after treatment with
        grapefruit seed extract, and therein lies the possibility that
        their diets were still not up to par.<br>

        </b>Nine year old Yogamaatha, from India, astonished onlookers
        in the United States recently, as she applied three blindfolds
        over her eyes and proceeded to read sentences from the piece of
        paper in front of her.<br>
        <br>
        How did she do this?<br>
        <br>
        Yogamaatha claims that she attended a course at Gurukul, in
        India, where she was initiated by a Guru and now possesses the
        unique ability to see with her third-eye. She states that this
        mystical power is a “learned ability”, opposing those who
        believe that gifts like these, are only for the chosen few.<br>
        <br>
        Not only can she read blindfolded, this nine-year old states
        that she can also ride a bicycle through traffic and dodge cars.<br>
        <br>
        In this short video, Yogamaatha’s curious abilities bring her
        all of the way to Capital Hill, where her eyes are covered and
        she is tested.<br>
        <br>
        She then makes her way to a Vedic Temple in Southern California
        and the results were astonishing, proving to onlookers that not
        only that she could read entire sentences, she also was able to
        play games, and even beat another child without blindfolds, at
        tic-tac-toe!<br>
        <br>
        Yogamaatha, is not the only child who has facilitating the
        teachings of the Guru’s in India. 12-year-old Ma Nithya
        Maheshwarananda from Dallas, USA says she opened her third eye
        just over a year ago while attending a three-week program.<br>
        <br>
        In this program the Master, by use of initiation and meditation,
        cultivates the inner dimension of yourself, by activating the
        pineal gland and nourishing the extrasensory abilities.</big><br>

        </b>What is concerned about binaural beats ( b.b. ), or binaural
        tones, You may read wikipedia (
        http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binaural_beats ), "B.b. are
        auditory processing artifacts, or apparent sounds, caused by
        specific physical stimuli. This effect was discovered in 1839 by
        Heinrich Wilhelm Dove and earned greater public awareness in the
        late 20th century based on claims coming from the alternative
        medicine community that binaural beats could help induce
        relaxation, meditation, creativity and other desirable mental
        states. The effect on the brainwaves depends on the difference
        in frequencies of each tone: for example, if 300 Hz was played
        in one ear and 310 in the other, then the binaural beat would
        have a frequency of 10 Hz."<br>
        For b.b. that I'm producing with software audacity, using some
        "mathemagia", mathematical constants such as Pi, the golden
        ratio, Lemniscatic elliptic function etc. B.b. are used for
        healing purpose, meditation and brain synch.<b><br>

        Selenium lies beneath sulfur in Group 16 of the periodic table.
        The chemical behavior and reactions of these elements are
        similar.<br>
        It is possible selenium was first observed in about the year
        1300 by the alchemist Arnold of Villanova. Villanova lived from
        about 1235 to about 1310 and was trained in medicine at the
        Sorbonne in Paris, becoming physician to Pope Clement V. In the
        book Rosarium Philosophorum he describes red sulfur or ‘sulfur
        rebeum’ which had been left behind in an oven after native
        sulfur had been vaporized. This may have been one of selenium’s
        red colored allotropes
        (http://www.chemicool.com/elements/selenium.html). <br>
        Selenium is used in Dr. Schüssler Salts therapy. The Dr.
        Schüssler Salts help to activate healing processes thus allowing
        regeneration and stabilisation the body's health.<br>

        Selenium is one main group of the periodic system of the
        elements molybdenum and tungsten after the Greek word 'Selene'
        on the Moon named, near the tellurium ("Earth"), with the metals
        in VI.<br>

          <small>Antimony / Antimonum Crudum [Sb2S3] V10.12</small><br>
        </b>Antimony (lat. Antimony, probably from Arabic itmid) with
        the chemical symbol SB (from Latin) Stibium = Grauspießglanz) is
        a relatively rare occurring chemical element and appears in
        solid form as a bright silver shiny, brittle semi-metal.
        Dignified, it happens also with arsenic as Allemontit
        (Stibarsen). More than a hundred antimony minerals, but only the
        Grauspießglanz (Antimonit, stibnite, Sb2S3) as recoverable are
        known.<br>
        In Alchemy, antimony is often symbolized as a Grey Wolf and was
        considered in many cases the earthly primal matter (prima
        materia) par excellence. According to a widespread opinion,
        "Spit glass" was a coagulierter Mercurius and so highly
        regarded. The prepared from antimony "Quintam essentiam
        Antimonii" was considered wonderful universal medicine, that
        make superfluous all other remedies.<br>
        Rudolf Steiner stated that antimony very easily in the essential
        is over and that the antimony processes that are brought into
        the human organism, have this effect, such as the EGO OR SELF.
        This effect is evident especially in the blood, which is the
        physical carrier of the EGO OR SELF organisation. Here, the
        antimony forces cause the coagulation of the blood.<br>
        "The antimony has a strong relationship to the sulfur compounds
        of other metals. The sulfur has a sum of properties, which is
        constant in only relatively narrow limits. He is sensitive to
        the processes of nature such as heating, combustion, etc. That
        makes him capable of, also an important role within the to play
        completely from the earth forces dissolving-out and
        einspannenden is in the essential effects protein substances. By
        the antimony kinship binds to the sulphur, it easily makes this
        clamp in the effects of ether. It is therefore easy to bring in
        the activity of the protein in the human body, and an ether
        effect to this, when this body by any condition can not even as
        turn a protein substance introduced from the outside that it
        incorporates its own activity.<br>
        The Gray Wolf, which bears the symbol of the Earth in its mouth
        (cups, 1662)<br>
        But the antimony shows other peculiarities. Where it can, it
        aims at the tuft-shaped design. It is thus divided in lines,
        which away from the Earth and towards seeking the forces acting
        in the ether. Putting something in the human organism, is the
        effect of the ether body halfway thus with antimony. Also that
        which goes into the Salim process with the antimony is, points
        to the ether relationship of this substance. It is through this
        process of fine grained. Now Seiger process is such a kind down
        physically starting and goes up into the essential. The antimony
        is divided in this transition into it.<br>
        Furthermore, the antimony, which oxidizes at roasting when
        burned produces an arising out of it white smoke that settles on
        cold bodies and the antimony flower shows.<br>
        In addition, the antimony has a certain defences against the
        electrical effects. Is it electrolytically treated in a certain
        way and at the cathode as precipitation, it explodes when in
        contact with a metal tip. All this shows that in the antimony
        tendency is included, in the ether element at the moment easily
        skip, where the conditions even in low levels to exist. All
        these details considered to be spiritual watching only hints;
        because this the relationship between EGO OR SELF activity and
        effectiveness of antimony perceives immediately so that the
        antimony processes, installed in the human organism, have this
        effect, such as the EGO OR SELF.<br>
        In the human organism, the blood shows a tendency to curdle in
        its flow. This trend is the one who is under the influence of
        the EGO OR SELF organisation and must learn the regulation under
        it. Blood is an organic product of the medium. What emerges in
        the blood, has undergone operations, which are on the way, to be
        those of the full body, i.e. the EGO OR SELF organisation. It
        must go through more operations, which are inserted into the
        design of this organism. They are kind, can be seen from the

        shows that it has the tendency to the channels by itself, but in
        the human organism on this clotting must continuously be
        prevented. What prevents blood from clotting, is the power by
        which the organism is divided up it. It fits into the body
        design by the forces of form, which lie just before clotting.
        Would enter the clotting, the life would be at risk. It was

            Copper Sulfate / Vitriol I</small><br>
        </b>Vitriol in the hermetic Alchemy was a popular fabric; He
        was, for example, used in the ointment of the weapon or the
        Pasilalinic sympathetic compass. Vitriol is the common name for
        the aqueous Crystal sulfate (salts of sulfuric acid) of Divalent
        metals, for example, the zinc or white vitriol (zinc sulfate,
        ZnSO4 • 7 H2O, the mineral Goslarit), the iron - or green
        vitriol (Eisen(II)-sulfat, FeSO4 • 7 H2O, the mineral
        Melanterite) and the copper or blue vitriol (copper sulfate,
        CuSO4 • 5 H2O, the mineral Chalcanthite). A mixture of copper
        sulfate and iron sulfate is also known as Eagle vitriol.<br>
        Vitriolum is an acronym from the initials of a motto of Alchemy,
        which first appears in the font L ' Azoth of the philosophes
        attributed to the Alchemist of Basilius Valentinus [7]: Visita
        interiora terrae rectificando invenies occultum lapidem, veram
        medicinam, "look at what is inside the Earth: by you clearing
        it, you will receive a previously hidden stone, (the true
        remedy)." This phrase alludes to the extraction of the copper
        vitriol; the honorary award to understand as a cipher for the
        Chalcanthite is under vera medicina: on the one hand, because
        the flower of honors has the color of copper vitriol, on the
        other hand, because this mineral was named flos formerly also
        cupri - 'Copper flower' (literally 'Copper flower' to
        translate).[8] In the vapor of the Rosicrucians and Freemasonry,
        this phrase - under veram deletion was reinterpreted medicinam -
        to a set of mystical contemplation and vitriol as a cipher for
        the philosopher's stone; The acronym VITRIOL can be found on the
        walls of the Masonic dark Chamber.<br>

        </b>When nine-year-old Rob Cole felt the life force slipping
        from his mother’s hand he could not foresee that this terrifying
        awareness of impending death was a gift that would lead him from
        the familiar life of 11th-century London to small villages
        throughout England and finally to the medical school at Ispahan.
        Though apprenticed to an itinerant barber surgeon, it is the
        dazzling surgery of a Jewish physician trained by the legendary
        Persian physician Avicenna that inspires him to accept his gift
        and to commit his life to healing by studying at Avicenna’s

        <br>
        I dialed '0' to check this out, and the operator confirmed that
        this was correct, so please pass it on.. (l also checked out
        snopes.com. This is true, and also applies to cell phones!)<b><br>
          <br>

        I received a telephone call last evening from an individual
        identifying himself as an AT&amp;T Service Technician (could
        also be Telus) who was conducting a test on the telephone lines.
        He stated that to complete the test I should touch nine (9),
        zero (0), the pound sign (#), and then hang up. Luckily, I was
        suspicious and refused.<br>
        <br>
        Upon contacting the telephone company, I was informed that by
        pushing 90#, you give the requesting individual full access to
        your telephone line, which enables<br>
        them to place long distance calls billed to your home phone
        number.<br>
        <br>
        I was further informed that this scam has been originating from
        many local jails/prisons. DO NOT Press 90# for ANYONE...<br>
        <br>
        The GTE Security Department requested that I share this
        information with EVERYONE I KNOW.<br>
        <br>
        After checking with Verizon they also said it was true, so do

        “Repeat a lie often enough and people believe it. We all know
        that. But there are millions of people out there who think a
        public-health agency like the CDC, a scientific body, would
        never engage in such tactics. Those millions of people would be
        wrong. There is a rule: the most holy, sacred, revered,
        uncontestable organization hides the biggest secrets. It’s a
        good rule to keep in mind. Major media don’t apply it. But you
        can.” (The Underground, Jon Rappoport)<br>
        <br>
        There are many propaganda operations surrounding the flu. Here I
        just want to boil down a few boggling facts.<br>
        <br>
        Dr. Peter Doshi, writing in the online BMJ (British Medical
        Journal), reveals one monstrosity.<br>
        <br>
        As Doshi states, every year, hundreds of thousands of
        respiratory samples are taken from flu patients in the US and
        tested in labs. Here is the kicker: only a small percentage of
        these samples show the presence of a flu virus.<br>
        <br>
        This means: most of the people in America who are diagnosed by
        doctors with the flu have no flu virus in their bodies.<br>
        <br>
        So they don’t have the flu.<br>
        <br>
        Therefore, even if you assume the flu vaccine is useful and
        safe, it couldn’t possibly prevent all those “flu cases” that
        aren’t flu cases.<br>
        <br>
        The vaccine couldn’t possibly work.<br>
        <br>
        The vaccine isn’t designed to prevent fake flu, unless pigs can
        fly.<br>
        <br>
        Here’s the exact quote from Peter Doshi’s BMJ review,
        “Influenza: marketing vaccines by marketing disease” (BMJ 2013;
        346:f3037):<br>
        <br>
        “…even the ideal influenza vaccine, matched perfectly to
        circulating strains of wild influenza and capable of stopping
        all influenza viruses, can only deal with a small part of the
        ‘flu’ problem because most ‘flu’ appears to have nothing to do
        with influenza. Every year, hundreds of thousands of respiratory
        specimens are tested across the US. Of those tested, on average
        16% are found to be influenza positive.<br>
        <br>
        “…It’s no wonder so many people feel that ‘flu shots’ don’t
        work: for most flus, they can’t.”<br>
        <br>
        Because most diagnosed cases of the flu aren’t the flu.<br>
        <br>
        So even if you’re a true believer in mainstream vaccine theory,
        you’re on the short end of the stick here. They’re conning your
        socks off.<br>
        <br>
        In December of 2005, the British Medical Journal (online)
        published another shocking Peter Doshi report, which created
        tremors through the halls of the Centers for Disease Control
        (CDC), where “the experts” used to tell the press that 36,000
        people in the US die every year from the flu.<br>
        <br>
        Here is a quote from Doshi’s report, “Are US flu death figures
        more PR than science?” (BMJ 2005; 331:1412):<br>
        <br>
        “[According to CDC statistics], ‘influenza and pneumonia’ took
        62,034 lives in 2001—61,777 of which were attributable to
        pneumonia and 257 to flu, and in only 18 cases was the flu virus
        positively identified.”<br>
        <br>
        Boom.<br>
        <br>
        You see, the CDC has created one overall category that combines
        both flu and pneumonia deaths. Why do they do this? Because they
        disingenuously assume that the pneumonia deaths are
        complications stemming from the flu.<br>
        <br>
        This is an absurd assumption. Pneumonia has a number of causes.<br>
        <br>
        But even worse, in all the flu and pneumonia deaths, only 18
        revealed the presence of an influenza virus.<br>
        <br>
        Therefore, the CDC could not say, with assurance, that more than
        18 people died of influenza in 2001. Not 36,000 deaths. 18
        deaths.<br>
        <br>
        Doshi continued his assessment of published CDC flu-death
        statistics: “Between 1979 and 2001, [CDC] data show an average
        of 1348 [flu] deaths per year (range 257 to 3006).” These
        figures refer to flu separated out from pneumonia.<br>
        <br>
        This death toll is obviously far lower than the parroted 36,000
        figure.<br>
        <br>
        However, when you add the sensible condition that lab tests have
        to actually find the flu virus in patients, the numbers of flu
        deaths plummet even further.<br>
        <br>
        In other words, it’s all promotion and hype.<br>
        <br>
        “Well, uh, we say that 36,000 people die from the flu every year
        in the US. But actually, it’s closer to 20. However, we can’t
        admit that, because if we did, we’d be exposing our gigantic
        psyop. The whole campaign to scare people into getting a flu
        shot would have about the same effect as warning people to carry
        iron umbrellas, in case toasters fall out of upper-story
        windows…and, by the way, we’d be put in prison for fraud.”<br>
        <br>
        False realities bloom from the intentional planting of false
        seeds. Bit by bit, garden by garden, pasture by pasture, the
        reality spreads, until it is considered unimpeachable. This is
        how the game works.<b><br>

        </b>[ Editor’s note:&nbsp; General Shahak was captured by Shiite
        militia and is still being held in Iraq.&nbsp; His captors are
        keeping DESI informed, a European security organization with
        close ties to VT.&nbsp; The article below is based on questions
        we submitted to his captors this morning.&nbsp; We also inquired
        as to the conditions under which he is being held... GD ] <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        USA Parliament (Intr) Foreign Minister and European Department
        for Security and Information Secretary General Ambassador Dr
        Haissam Bou Said exclusively confirms to VT that the Israeli
        Brigadier Yussi Elon Shahak captured by the Iraqi popular army
        confessed during the investigation that…<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;“There is a strong cooperation between MOSSAD and ISIS top
        military commanders,” asserting that&nbsp; “there are Israeli
        advisors helping the Organization on laying out strategic and
        military plans, and guiding them in the battlefield.”<br>
        <br>
        The terrorist organization also has military consultants from
        Saudi Arabia, Qatar, United Arab Emirates and Jordan. Saudi
        Arabia has so far provided ISIS with 30,000 vehicles, while
        Jordan rendered 4500 vehicles. Qatar and United Arab Emirates
        delivered funds for covering ISIS overall expenditure.<br>
        <br>
        The planes belonging to the aforesaid countries are still
        landing in the Mosel airport, carrying military aid and
        fighters, especially&nbsp; via the Jordanian borders.<br>
        <br>
        The Parliament and the DESI also confirm the Death of ISIS
        leader Abu Baker al Baghdadi, who received two bullets: one in
        the head and the other in the shoulder in a fire exchange. Two
        of his top aides were killed as well.&nbsp; It is believed that
        the CIA and MOSSAD are behind his death as he becomes a wasted
        commodity.<br>
        <br>
        Furthermore, Eight ISIS top commanders were killed in “Haith” in
        an Iraqi airstrike after two weeks of surveillance by the Iraqi
        military service.<br>
        <br>
        The report concluded&nbsp; that ISIS terrorist group recently
        arrested&nbsp; in Moscow came from Syria and Iraq through
        Ukraine. The&nbsp; perpetrators were planning to carry out
        subversive operations in railways and bus stations. The bombers
        are from Chechen, Caucasus, Iraqi, Syrian and Saudi
        nationalities.<br>
        <br>
        Ukraine became the hotbed of embracing terrorist activities in
        complicity with Putin’s arch enemies who want to break up Russia
        and then absorb it in revenge of his military intervention in
        Syria.<br>

        </b>Rabbi Baruch Efrati believes Jews should 'rejoice at the
        fact that Europe is paying for what it did to us for hundreds of
        years by losing its identity.' He praises Islam for promoting
        modesty, respect for God…<br>
        <br>
        "With the help of God, the gentiles there will adopt a healthier
        life with a lot of modesty and integrity, and not like the
        hypocritical Christianity which appears pure but is
        fundamentally corrupt," he explained. <br>
        <br>
        Efrati wrote in response that the Islamization of Europe was
        better than a Christian Europe for ethical and theological
        reasons – as a punishment against Christians for persecuting the
        Jews and the fact that Christianity, as opposed to Islam, is
        considered "idolatry" from a halachic point of view.<br>
        <br>
        "Jews should rejoice at the fact that Christian Europe is losing
        its identity as a punishment for what it did to us for the
        hundreds of years were in exile there," the rabbi explained as
        the ethical reason for favoring Muslims, quoting shocking
        descriptions from the Rishonim literature (written by leading
        rabbis who lived during the 11th to 15th centuries) about
        pogroms and mass murders committed by Christians against Jews.<br>
        <br>
        We will never forgive Europe's Christians for slaughtering
        millions of our children, women and elderly… Not just in the
        recent Holocaust, but throughout the generations, in a
        consistent manner which characterizes all factions of
        hypocritical Christianity…<br>
        <br>
        "A now, Europe is losing its identity in favor of another people
        and another religion, and there will be no remnants and
        survivors from the impurity of Christianity, which shed a lot of
        blood it won't be able to atone for."<br>
        <br>
        'Islam a relatively honest religion'<br>
        <br>
        The theological reason, according to Rabbi Efrati, is that
        Christianity – which he sees as idolatry – has a tendency to
        "destroy normal life and abstain from it on the one hand, while
        losing modesty on the other hand," as it "ranges between radical
        monasticism to radical Western licentiousness."<br>
        <br>
        Islam, the rabbi added, is "a religion which misjudges its
        prophets but is relatively honest. It educates a bit more for a
        stable life of marriage and creation, where there is certain
        modesty and respect for God.<br>
        <br>
        Efrati ruled, therefore, that "even if we are in a major war
        with the region's Arabs over the Land of Israel, Islam is still
        much better as a gentile culture than Christianity."<br>
        <br>
        He added, however, that Jews must pray that the Islamization of
        most of Europe will not harm the people of Israel. <br>

          .</b>..On Tuesday evening, Prime Minister Netanyahu made
        comments during a Zionist Congress meeting which raised a few
        eyebrows…<br>
        <br>
        "Hitler didn’t want to exterminate the Jews at the time, he
        wanted to expel the Jews," he said. "And Haj Amin al-Husseini
        went to Hitler and said, 'If you expel them, they’ll all come
        here.' 'So what should I do with them?' he asked. He said, 'Burn
        them.'"<br>
        <br>
        In the 1920s and 30s, Haj Amin al-Husseini was the Grand Mufti
        of Jerusalem, a Palestinian religious leader. While he was
        certainly no saint, to suggest that he was responsible for
        giving one of the most evil men in history his worst ideas is
        patently absurd. Especially given that Hitler was pushing for
        Jewish extermination a full two years before even meeting
        al-Husseini...<b><br>

        </b>For a tiny sac of neurons,&nbsp; it zaps an ordinary day
        into havoc – like lightning strikes an iron rod, long before
        you’re aware dragon moods strike. Whenever your day jolts you
        off reliable tracks, it’s likely the seething culprit, and in
        some brains it burns like fury just below the surface.<br>
        <br>
        On the other hand recent research shows your amygdala is also
        key to socializing, and a larger amygdala means more friends and
        family involvement.<br>
        <br>
        Want to tackle hot topics without shout outs? Perhaps you’ve
        heard of the amygdala, or seen current research about its role
        in creating and storing emotional reactions to frightening
        situations. But have you heard how it turns ordinary days into
        train wrecks?<br>
        <br>
        At times it’s a matter of learning to let go, yet once its power
        over your day is discovered, you can guide the amygdala to work
        more in your favor.&nbsp; It even helps you move from fear to
        freedom.<br>
        <br>
        Located deep within your brain’s temporal lobes, this almond
        shaped mood bender,&nbsp; helps to shape and store reactions to
        unexpected shockers in your day. Will you shout or smile? Will
        you freeze in fear or risk with courage? The little neuron group
        pretty much decides for you. Sit through an upsetting meeting,
        and this tiny arousal center may well incite negative emotions
        in response. Have you seen it happen?<br>
        <br>
        There’s more too. This agitated control center engages brain
        stem circuits that impact facial expressions and body language.
        It also triggers release of chemicals such as serotonin or
        cortisol into the blood, to trigger often unwanted emotional
        response. It’s even activated by nasty odors on occasion. So why
        does the human brain come with such a pesky part?...<b><br>

        </b>Once upon a time America fought a great war to rid the world
        of the Nazis, but now we have become just like them.&nbsp; In
        fact, I would venture to say that the Nazification of the United
        States is pretty much complete.&nbsp; As you will see below, we
        have a heavily socialized economy where tax rates are out of
        control and lots of freebies are given out just like the Nazis
        did.&nbsp; And just like the Nazis, our society has become
        highly militarized and our government has become increasingly
        obsessed with watching, tracking, monitoring and controlling the
        general population.&nbsp; But more than anything else, all of
        the pageantry and beauty in our society masks an evil which has
        grown to a level that is almost unspeakable.&nbsp; The other
        day, my wife and I were watching some footage of the beautiful
        parades and celebrations that were held in Germany before World
        War II, and they certainly were very impressive.&nbsp; But under
        the surface, a great evil was growing.&nbsp; Just because
        something happens behind closed doors does not make it okay, and
        just like the Nazis, our society is about to learn an
        exceedingly painful lesson in that regard…<br>

        </b>When someone is right over and over and over, eventually
        people start paying attention.&nbsp; Personally, I have learned
        to tune out the “forecasts” of most “economic experts” out
        there.&nbsp; As an attorney, I was trained to be skeptical, and
        I have found that most forecasts about what the financial
        markets are going to do are not worth the paper they are printed
        on.&nbsp; However, once in a while something comes along that
        really gets my attention.&nbsp; Over the past few days, I have
        seen a number of references to the remarkable forecasts of Bo
        Polny of Gold 2020 Forecast.&nbsp; In recent months he has
        correctly predicted that U.S. stocks would begin to drop in
        July, that there would be a huge plunge in August and that that
        the month of September would be rather uneventful.&nbsp; Now he
        is saying that he expects “November to be a complete meltdown on
        the U.S. and world markets”.&nbsp; Just because he has been
        right in the past does not guarantee that he will be correct
        this time around, but lots of people (like me) are starting to
        pay attention….<b><br>

      <big><b><br>
        </b>As readers know, I have emphasized that the declared
        neoconservative intention of achieving global hegemony has
        resurrected the threat of nuclear armageddon as Russia and China
        are most definitely not going to submit, as every European
        country, the UK, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Columbia, and
        Japan have submitted, to being Washington’s vassals.<br>
        <br>
        The president of Russia and the president of China have made
        this completely clear.<br>
        <br>
        If the arrogance, ignorance and incompetence of the Western
        political systems permit the continuation of the crazed, totally
        unrealistic, neoconservative agenda, the planet will die.<br>
        <br>
        Ronald Reagan is the only US president during the era of nuclear
        weapons who was committed to removing them from all arsenals. I
        know because I was a part of his effort. If you can’t believe
        me, ask Pat Buchanan who was with Reagan at Reykjavik. In
        previous columns on my website, I quoted Buchanan’s response to
        my statements. Buchanan wrote to me that I was correct, that
        Reagan wanted rid of every nuclear weapon. That was President
        Reagan’s primary goal and is the reason for his economic
        program, which he placed in my hands. Reagan reasoned that if
        the US economy could be restored, the inability of the Soviet
        economy to be restored would allow him to pressure the Soviets
        into agreement to end the cold war and rid the world of nuclear
        weapons. When I get letters from those denouncing Reagan for his
        crimes, I wonder at the pride that the writers show in their
        utter ignorance and stupidity.<br>
        <br>
        What the neocons have done is to throw away every treaty and
        violate every agreement that had the world on the path to
        nuclear disarmament. These evil persons have caused massive
        moderization of Soviet and Chinese nuclear forces. There is no
        prospect whatsoever of American hegemony over the world. Yet,
        the insane neoconservatives continue to speak as if the world is
        subordinate to them, a collection of arrogant two-bit punks who
        could not subdue a few thousand lightly armed Taliban after 14
        years of effort and American sacrifice and whose disastrous
        policies have made, until Vladimir Putin’s intervention, the
        Islamic State the most potent military force in the Middle East.<br>
        <br>
        The damned neoconservatives have destroyed seven countries, and
        the bastards and bitches walk around free!<br>
        <br>
        Their two-bit, dumbshit punk media spokespersons ask, “What’s
        the good of nuclear weapons if you can’t use them?”<br>
        <br>
        If the insouciant Western population sits on its sofa watching
        “reality shows” while the insane neoconservatives who control

        </b>While it is impossible to precisely predict all the human
        impacts that would result from a nuclear winter, it is
        relatively simple to predict those which would be most profound.
        That is, a nuclear winter would cause most humans and large
        animals to die from nuclear famine in a mass extinction event
        similar to the one that wiped out the dinosaurs.<br>
        <br>
        Following the detonation (in conflict) of US and/or Russian
        launch-ready strategic nuclear weapons, nuclear firestorms would
        burn simultaneously over a total land surface area of many
        thousands or tens of thousands of square miles. These mass
        fires, many of which would rage over large cities and industrial
        areas, would release many tens of millions of tons of black
        carbon soot and smoke (up to 180 million tons, according to
        peer-reviewed studies), which would rise rapidly above cloud
        level and into the stratosphere. [For an explanation of the
        calculation of smoke emissions, see Atmospheric effects &amp;
        societal consequences of regional scale nuclear conflicts.]<br>
        <br>
        The scientists who completed the most recent peer-reviewed
        studies on nuclear winter discovered that the sunlight would
        heat the smoke, producing a self-lofting effect that would not
        only aid the rise of the smoke into the stratosphere (above
        cloud level, where it could not be rained out), but act to keep
        the smoke in the stratosphere for 10 years or more. The
        longevity of the smoke layer would act to greatly increase the
        severity of its effects upon the biosphere.<br>
        <br>
        Once in the stratosphere, the smoke (predicted to be produced by
        a range of strategic nuclear wars) would rapidly engulf the
        Earth and form a dense stratospheric smoke layer. The smoke from
        a war fought with strategic nuclear weapons would quickly
        prevent up to 70% of sunlight from reaching the surface of the
        Northern Hemisphere and 35% of sunlight from reaching the
        surface of the Southern Hemisphere. Such an enormous loss of
        warming sunlight would produce Ice Age weather conditions on
        Earth in a matter of weeks. For a period of 1-3 years following
        the war, temperatures would fall below freezing every day in the
        central agricultural zones of North America and Eurasia. [For an
        explanation of nuclear winter, see Nuclear winter revisited with
        a modern climate model and current nuclear arsenals: Still
        catastrophic consequences.]<br>
        <br>
        Nuclear winter would cause average global surface temperatures
        to become colder than they were at the height of the last Ice
        Age. Such extreme cold would eliminate growing seasons for many
        years, probably for a decade or longer. Can you imagine a winter
        that lasts for ten years?<br>
        <br>
        The results of such a scenario are obvious. Temperatures would
        be much too cold to grow food, and they would remain this way
        long enough to cause most humans and animals to starve to death.<br>
        <br>
        Global nuclear famine would ensue in a setting in which the
        infrastructure of the combatant nations has been totally
        destroyed, resulting in massive amounts of chemical and
        radioactive toxins being released into the biosphere. We don’t
        need a sophisticated study to tell us that no food and Ice Age
        temperatures for a decade would kill most people and animals on
        the planet.&nbsp; Would the few remaining survivors be able to
        survive in a radioactive, toxic environment?<br>
        <br>
        It is, of course, debatable whether or not nuclear winter could
        cause human extinction. There is essentially no way to truly
        “know” without fighting a strategic nuclear war. Yet while it is
        crucial that we all understand the mortal peril that we face, it
        is not necessary to engage in an unwinnable academic debate as
        to whether any humans will survive.<br>
        <br>
        What is of the utmost importance is that this entire subject
        –the catastrophic environmental consequences of nuclear war –
        has been effectively dropped from the global discussion of
        nuclear weaponry. The focus is instead upon “nuclear terrorism”,
        a subject that fits official narratives and centers upon the
        danger of one nuclear weapon being detonated – yet the
        scientifically predicted consequences of nuclear war are never
        publically acknowledged or discussed.<br>
        <br>
        Why has the existential threat of nuclear war been effectively
        omitted from public debate? Perhaps the leaders of the nuclear
        weapon states do not want the public to understand that their
        nuclear arsenals represent a self-destruct mechanism for the
        human race?&nbsp; Such an understanding could lead to a demand
        that nuclear weapons be banned and abolished.<br>
        <br>
        Consequently, the nuclear weapon states continue to maintain and
        modernize their nuclear arsenals, as their leaders remain silent
        about the ultimate threat that nuclear war poses to the human
        species.<b><br>

      Previously in this series of posts we outlined how inside the US
      special interests use political technologies to keep the
      population fooled. We also showed how these efforts will
      eventually fail, either through internal contradiction or because
      the parasites eventually end up killing the host. We will now turn
      our attention to political technologies used by the US against the
      rest of the world. This may seem like a digression from the task
      of addressing the question at hand—of how to bring about social
      change in order to avert climate catastrophe—but it is necessary.<br>
      <br>
      The long list of political technologies used within the US to keep
      Americans fooled helped us show just how pervasive and destructive
      these technologies are. We are yet to see any ways to neutralize
      these technologies—because Americans have failed to do so. To find
      examples of successful ways to neutralize them, we have to look at
      what the US has been attempting to do to the rest of the world—and
      failing...<br>

      CONTENT WARNING: Discussion of violence<br>
      <br>
      The converging crises that are descending on our planet are the
      direct responsibility of the powerful who preside over
      civilization today. The political and economic elite of yesteryear
      would not have known about the effects of burning fossil fuels,
      but the elite of today have no such excuse. They know very well
      what the consequences of their actions will be, and continue
      regardless. In this sense they are very culpable for the future
      murder of billions of humans, not to mention the trillions upon
      trillions of non-human animals, and the extinction of trillions of
      species.<br>
      <br>
      If there is any doubt that the powerful know exactly what they are
      doing, this myth should be dispelled by very existence of luxury
      condos, priced in the millions, built in an abandoned nuclear
      missile silo at an undisclosed location in Kansas
      (http://www.survivalcondo.com/). The powerful are actively
      preparing for the disaster that they have unleashed, while the
      rest of us will be left to die in privation.<br>
      <br>
      The mainstream environmental movement has been selling us a grand
      lie. The grand lie is the concept of personal responsibility among
      the powerless. They have sold the idea that we are just as
      culpable as the powerful because we drive cars, consume products,
      etc. As if we have a say in how civilization is organized! As if
      we have leverage against a self-perpetuating 12,000 year old
      system of slavery and exploitation! This is the grand
      dis-empowering lie that convinces people that they can avoid
      certain catastrophe by driving hybrid cars. To believe this lie is
      to excuse the powerful of their responsibility, and therefore
      never come to a clear understanding of what our future will look
      like.<br>
      <br>
      Yet I believe that while confronting these power arrangements we
      run the risk of&nbsp; falling into a state of anticipatory
      victimization. Our extinction as a species, in my opinion, should
      not have any bearing on how we view ourselves in the interim. To
      hold on to the identity of the victim, we sabotage the opportunity
      to make the most out of what very well may be our last decades on
      this planet. Our narrative is such that we are prone to falling
      into a Post Traumatic Stress (or perhaps I should say
      Pre-Traumatic Stress) reaction. Dealing with this reaction means
      that we must reclaim power over our lives, and re-frame our
      narrative to one of empowerment….<br>
      <br>
      The first step that comes to my mind is that we must not blame
      ourselves. A major tactic of corporate power, and one that the
      mainstream NGO environmental movement buys into, is to lay the
      blame for climate change at the feet of every individual who uses
      fossil fuels. This has a bi-fold effect. Number one, it removes
      blame from the powerful, who under this rubric only share as much
      blame as poor people driving to work at McDonald’s and Walmart.
      Number two, it derails the environmental movement into a foray of
      useless spending habits, personal guilt, and at the extreme,
      suicidal grief and depression. In short, we must understand that
      this is not our doing.<br>
      <br>
      Overcoming trauma means re-framing the narrative of the traumatic
      event as to empower the victim. The traumatic event that we are
      dealing with is gradual and unfolding. This makes even perceiving
      the narrative as a whole very difficult. However, it also means
      that we have the opportunity to shift the narrative in real time,
      as someone fending off an attacker might do. Although our actions
      may not change anything in the long term, and our species will
      still be doomed to extinction, we can live our time left on our
      own terms.<br>
      <br>
      What does this mean for how we live? What would fending off our
      attacker look like? I don’t make claims to know exactly. I can
      say, however that our politics are going to look much different
      than they have in the past . Although I generally refuse to debate
      to which degree our collective future is set in stone, I do feel
      comfortable extrapolating current trends. Placing hypothetical
      situations at the forefront of political thought seems foolish to
      me, as none of us are clairvoyant. Hypothetically, if all fossil
      fuels were left in the ground, and no more were burned as of
      tomorrow, we might have a chance of survival as a species.
      Hypothetically, a solar storm could knock the grid offline, saving
      the natural world from further extirpation. Hypothetically, the
      powerful could adopt humane policies to reduce human suffering
      during ecological and industrial collapse. We know, however, that
      these are sordid fantasies. They are sordid because they detract
      from real suffering being visited upon the natural world everyday,
      and the suffering of those humans to which the apocalypse is not a
      distant future event, or a clever metaphor. For many people, the
      end of the world has arrived, in all of it’s painful indifference
      to life, love, and any sense of fairness or equality. To
      paraphrase Orwell, if you want a vision of the future, look at the
      Democratic Republic of Congo.<br>
      <br>
      I’ve taken this to mean that our politics must necessarily be
      reaction based. There will be no better tomorrow, no salvation, no
      retribution or justice. There will be pain, a pain that we will
      not be able to alleviate, only react to in the interim, before our
      inevitable untimely deaths. For these reasons I consider political
      philosophies that seek to create a better world outdated, and I
      feel we are forced to adopt a reaction based politic.<br>
      <br>
      Reactive politics do not have constraints, they do not adhere to a
      specific goal, they are unique to the individual, and are
      therefore indomitable. For each individual with a reactive
      politics, there is the potential for action. Reactive politics can
      not be defeated, for it has no desire to win, indeed, winning is
      seen as impossible, and abstract to the point of protecting
      civilization from it’s enemies. Revolt, for the reactive
      individual, is for it’s own sake. Reactive politics cannot be
      co-opted, they exist only in the moment of action. When wild
      animals, and wild humans kill civilization’s emissaries, they are
      engaging in reactive politics. The killing is not meant to
      culminate into a revolution, nor is it based in an ideology, but
      is a reaction to an immediate threat. Humans engage in reactive
      politics even when all hope is lost, as was the case for many of
      those who participated in the Warsaw Ghetto uprising. They chose
      to die in their own terms, despite the knowledge that their deaths
      were certain. Over this century, as more and more communities come
      to see that hope is lost to head off climate change, reactivity
      will become a common form of radical politics, and the powerful
      will have much more to fear.<br>

      <b> Excerpt :<br>
        <br>
      </b>...Lately I’ve been thinking about the founding fathers of
      this country. I used to turn to them for solace, wondering how
      they would feel about their Republic-cum-Empire, and thinking
      they’d be distraught about the fascist state we’ve become.<br>
      <br>
      The world’s best-known collection of dead white guys had much to
      say about religion, most of it bad. But the mostly ignorant,
      church-going members of the American populace have gobbled up so
      many bullshit sandwiches that the fairy tales they’ve adopted
      about the religious views of the founding fathers are nearly as
      grand as the ones they’ve accepted about spirits in our midst. The
      founding fathers were deists, and they were very clear about the
      separation of church and state. Had Charles Darwin published the
      Origin of Species a century sooner, there is little doubt the
      reasonable men who founded the United States would have leaned
      even further away from the cross.<br>
      <br>
      If the First Amendment doesn’t provide a compelling enough example
      about the founding fathers and their disrespect for religion,
      perhaps these passages will elucidate the issue:<br>
      <br>
      “During almost fifteen centuries, the legal establishment of
      Christianity has been on trial. What have been the fruits of this
      trial? More or less in all places, pride and indolence in the
      Clergy; ignorance and servility in the laity; and in both, clergy
      and laity, superstition, bigotry and persecution.” (James Madison,
      speech to the General Assembly of Virginia, 1785)<br>
      <br>
      “Religious controversies are always productive of more acrimony
      and irreconcilable hatreds than those which spring from any other
      cause. I had hoped that liberal and enlightened thought would have
      reconciled the Christians so that their [not our?] religious
      fights would not endanger the peace of Society.” (George
      Washington, letter to Sir Edward Newenham, 22 June 1792)<br>
      <br>
      “The government of the United States is not in any sense founded
      on the Christian religion.” (Article 11, Treaty of Tripoli, signed
      by John Adams, 7 June 1797)<br>
      <br>
      “Believing with you that religion is a matter which lies solely
      between man and his God, that he owes account to none other for
      his faith or his worship, that the legislative powers of
      government reach actions only, and not opinions, I contemplate
      with sovereign reverence that act of the whole American people
      which declared that their legislature should ‘make no law
      respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free
      exercise thereof,’ thus building a wall of separation between
      church and State.” (Thomas Jefferson, letter to a Committee of the
      Danbury Baptist Association, Connecticut, 1 January 1802)<br>
      <br>
      “As I understand the Christian religion, it was, and is, a
      revelation. But how has it happened that millions of fables,
      tales, legends, have been blended with both Jewish and Christian
      revelation that have made them the most bloody religion that ever
      existed?” (John Adams, letter to F.A. Van der Kamp, 27 December
      1816)<br>
      <br>
      “Among the features peculiar to the political system of the United
      States, is the perfect equality of rights which it secures to
      every religious sect.” (James Madison, letter to Jacob de la
      Motta, August 1820)<br>
      <br>
      The contemporary view: Surely Madison didn’t mean to include
      Muslims. Or atheists. Or agnostics. Or anybody except Gawd-fearing
      Christians...<b><br>

            captured Syrian town</b><br>
        </big></div>
      <br>
      ISIS jihadists have reportedly issued “eleven commandments” as
      part of a contract that guarantees safety to the Christian
      population living in the Syrian town of Al-Qaryatayn controlled by
      the terror group.<br>
      <br>
      ISIS has delivered an ultimatum to Christians from the city of
      Al-Qaryatayn in the southeast of Homs Governorate, which they
      captured last month, making them choose between converting to
      Islam, signing a contract, paying Jizya (a tax imposed on
      non-Muslims) or leaving, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights
      reports.<br>
      <br>
      The ‘safety’ contract drawn up by Islamic State (IS, formerly
      ISIS/ISIL) leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi comprises 11 specific
      commandments that all Christians who decided to stay in the town
      must follow. The stipulations prohibit the establishing of
      churches, exposing Muslims to Christian religious symbols,
      undermining Islamic State, possessing weapons and trading pork or
      wine…<br>

          <b> </b><br>
          <b> </b>With the projected importation of 200,000 Syrian
          Muslim refugees and continued 1.2 million legal immigrants
          annually along with the average 500,000 illegal migrants each
          year—within 30 years, we expect an added 100,000,000 (million)
          third world refugees.&nbsp; If not stopped, you must prepare
          for a different society: hundreds of competing languages,
          multiple worldviews and hundreds of incompatible cultures
          struggling within American society.<br>
          <br>
          But before all that happens, pray tell, how many killing
          machines will Obama and Kerry import into our country with
          those 200,000 Syrian Muslim refugees?&nbsp; What immediate
          impact must we face?&nbsp;&nbsp; For certain, hundreds of
          American communities face Muslims rapists and jihadists who
          will kill any of us just like the Fort Hood killings, Fort Dix
          Six, Times Square Bomber, Boston Marathon Bomber brothers and
          more to come. Virtually all those refugees expect unending
          welfare into the future—on your tax dollar.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          <br>
          <br>
          Think Paris, France killings of 12 cartoonists expressing
          their political rights in a free country.&nbsp; Think of the
          beheading of a man on the streets of London in broad daylight.
          Think of the killers in the coffee shop in Sydney, Australia.
          Think of the gunman charging into capitol building in Ottawa,
          Canada to kills as many as possible.&nbsp; Try on for size the
          five nights of riots last week in Stockholm, Sweden. Think
          about the fact that Norwegian women cannot walk down their own
          city streets without fear of being raped and killed.<br>
          <b> </b><br>
          <b> THE SOURCE OF ANIMALIZATION OF HUMAN BEINGS</b><br>
          <b> </b><br>
          <b> </b>Dayanand Saraswati, Indian sage, said in 1883,
          "Having thus given a cursory view of the Koran, I lay it
          before the sensible person with the purpose that they should
          know what kind of a book the Koran is. I have no hesitation to
          say that it cannot be the work of either God or of a learned
          man, nor can it be a book of knowledge. Here its very vital
          defect has been exposed with the object that people may not
          waste their life falling into its imposition. The Koran is the
          result of ignorance, the source of animalization of human
          beings, a fruitful cause of destroying peace, an incentive to
          war, and propagator of hostility among men and a promoter of
          suffering in society. As to defect of repetition, the Koran is
          its store."<br>
          <br>
          Let’s investigate how Islam “animalizes” men.&nbsp; Not
          withstanding, until the past two decades, most Western
          countries never heard of honor killings averaging 10,000 women
          annually, female genital mutilation, arranged marriages,
          killing of gays, acid in girls’ faces for attending school,
          beheadings or burning of living human beings by moderate
          Muslims.&nbsp; But such practices remain the mainstay of the
          Koran since the 6th century when their bloody prophet dictated
          and practiced those “animal” acts against anyone who argued
          with him.&nbsp; He chopped off peoples’ heads and hands for
          heaven sakes!<br>
          <br>
          You must wonder what kind of a monster created such a religion
          of violence.&nbsp; Saraswati, the Indian Sage, wasn’t alone in
          his observations of Islam’s violence.<br>
          <br>
          U.S. President John Quincy Adams in 1829 said, “The precept of
          the Koran is, perpetual war against all who deny, that Mahomet
          is the prophet of God. The vanquished may purchase their
          lives, by the payment of tribute; the victorious may be
          appeased by a false and delusive promise of peace; and the
          faithful follower of the prophet, may submit to the imperious
          necessities of defeat: but the command to propagate the Moslem
          creed by the sword is always obligatory, when it can be made
          effective. The commands of the prophet may be performed alike,
          by fraud, or by force.”<br>
          <br>
          From the 1972 Olympic killings to 9/11, Muslims spread their
          power by terror, fear and bombs.&nbsp; Example: The Shoe
          Bomber was a Muslim, The Beltway Snipers were Muslims, The
          Fort Hood Shooter was a Muslim, The underwear Bomber was a
          Muslim, The U.S.S. Cole Bombers were Muslims, The Madrid Train
          Bombers were Muslims, The Bali Nightclub Bombers were Muslims,
          The London Subway Bombers were Muslims, The Moscow Theater
          Attackers were Muslims, The Boston Marathon Bombers were
          Muslims, The Pan-Am flight #93 Bombers were Muslims, The Air
          France Entebbe Hijackers were Muslims, The Iranian Embassy
          Takeover, was by Muslims, The Beirut U.S. Embassy bombers were
          Muslims, The Libyan U.S. Embassy Attack was by Muslims, The
          Buenos Aires Suicide Bombers were Muslims, The Israeli Olympic
          Team Attackers were Muslims,The Kenyan US, Embassy Bombers
          were Muslims, The Saudi, Khobar Towers Bombers were Muslims,
          The Beirut Marine Barracks bombers were Muslims, The Besian
          Russian School Attackers were Muslims, The first World Trade
          Center Bombers were Muslims, The Bombay &amp; Mumbai India
          Attackers were Muslims, The Achille Lauro Cruise Ship
          Hijackers were Muslims, The September 11th 2001 Airline
          Hijackers were Muslims.<br>
          <br>
          How many of those young men among the 200,000 Syrian Muslim
          refugees will kill someone you know, rape any American woman
          and terrorize the rest of us with the fear that they will
          carry out their prime directive in the Koran: “Convert or kill
          all non-believers.”<br>
          <br>
          My bet?&nbsp; Hundreds if not thousands of Americans will be
          sacrificed in the death toll as those Syrians move into our
          communities.&nbsp; <br>
          <br>
          Again, Muslims cannot in any way become Americans. The Koran
          forbids it.&nbsp; Their entire religious context demands
          subjugation to their religion with no allegiance to the U.S.
          Constitution. The Koran forbids women’s rights, marital
          choice, free speech, gay rights and religious rights.&nbsp;
          Our way of life remains completely out of bounds to Islam.
          This 4-minute video explains our plight:<br>

          <b> </b>As their aberrant culture moves into your communities
          across this country, everything will change. You will be
          driven into fear from speaking up so as not to “question”
          Muslims and their culture. They will force Hilal foods into
          your schools.&nbsp; They will protest against Christmas. They
          will protest against Easter. They will push for burka wearing
          by all women. They will march and they will riot. Look at
          YouTube to find videos on “How to beat your woman without
          leaving any marks.”<br>
          <br>
          As mentioned, as their numbers grow, their power grows. They
          chase out and displace cultures, languages and ethos of host
          countries. It’s the nature of Islam.<br>
          <br>
          Koran, Sura 8, verse 12:&nbsp; “Instill terror in the hearts
          of unbelievers. Cut off their heads and cut off the tips of
          their fingers.”<br>
          <br>
          Sura 9, verse 5: “Then fight and slay the Pagans wherever you
          find them. And seize them, beleaguer them and lie in wait for
          them, in every stratagem of war.”<br>
          <br>
          That applies to weak, moderate and all Muslims. If they follow
          the Koran, they must abide by its dictates.&nbsp; And, they
          do.&nbsp; When 9/11 hit, Muslims worldwide danced in the
          streets. Look up the videos on YouTube.<br>

        </div>
        <div align="left"><br>
          <b> </b>Massive inbreeding within the Muslim culture during
          the last 1.400 years may have done catastrophic damage to
          their gene pool. The consequences of intermarriage between
          first cousins often have serious impact on the offspring’s
          intelligence, sanity, health and on their surroundings<br>
          <br>
          The most famous example of inbreeding is in ancient Egypt,
          where several Pharaonic dynasties collapsed after a couple of
          hundred years. In order to keep wealth and power within the
          family, the Pharaohs often married their own sister or
          half-sister and after a handful of generations the offspring
          were mentally and physically unfit to rule. Another historical
          example is the royal houses of Europe where royal families
          often married among each other because tradition did not allow
          them to marry people of non-royal class.<br>
          <br>
          The high amount of mentally retarded and handicapped royalties
          throughout European history shows the unhealthy consequences
          of this practice. Luckily, the royal families have now allowed
          themselves to marry for love and not just for status.<br>
          <br>
          The Muslim culture still practices inbreeding and has been
          doing so for longer than any Egyptian dynasty. This practice
          also predates the world’s oldest monarchy (the Danish) by 300
          years.<br>
          <br>
          A rough estimate shows that close to half of all Muslims in
          the world are inbred: In Pakistan, 70 percent of all marriages
          are between first cousins (so-called "consanguinity") and in
          Turkey the amount is between 25-30 percent (Jyllands-Posten,
          27/2 2009 More stillbirths among immigrants"<br>
          <br>
          Statistical research on Arabic countries shows that up to 34
          percent of all marriages in Algiers are consanguine (blood
          related), 46 percent in Bahrain, 33 percent in Egypt, 80
          percent in Nubia (southern area in Egypt), 60 percent in Iraq,
          64 percent in Jordan, 64 percent in Kuwait, 42 percent in
          Lebanon, 48 percent in Libya, 47 percent in Mauritania, 54
          percent in Qatar, 67 percent in Saudi Arabia, 63 percent in
          Sudan, 40 percent in Syria, 39 percent in Tunisia, 54 percent
          in the United Arabic Emirates and 45 percent in Yemen
          (Reproductive Health Journal, 2009 Consanguinity and
          reproductive health among Arabs.).<br>
          <br>
          A large part of inbred Muslims are born from parents who are
          themselves inbred - which increase the risks of negative
          mental and physical consequenses greatly.<br>
          <br>
          The amount of blood related marriages is lower among Muslim
          immigrants living in the West. Among Pakistanis living in
          Denmark the amount is down to 40 percent and 15 percent among
          Turkish immigrants (Jyllands-Posten, 27/2 2009 More
          stillbirths among immigrants".).<br>
          <br>
          More than half of Pakistani immigrants living in Britain are
          intermarried:<br>
          <br>
          The research, conducted by the BBC and broadcast to a shocked
          nation on Tuesday, found that at least 55% of the community
          was married to a first cousin. This is thought to be linked to
          the probability that a British Pakistani family is at least 13
          times more likely than the general population to have children
          with recessive genetic disorders.” (Times of India, 17/11 2005

          The lower percentages might be because it is difficult to get
          the chosen family member to the country, or because health
          education is better in the West.<br>

          <b> Low intelligence</b><br>
          <b> </b><br>
          <b> </b>Several studies show that children of consanguineous
          marriages have lower intelligence than children of non-related
          parents. Research shows that the IQ is 10-16 points lower in
          children born from related parents and that abilities related
          to social behavior develops slower in inbred babies:<br>
          <br>
          "Effects of parental consanguinity on the cognitive and social
          behavior of children have been studied among the Ansari
          Muslims of Bhalgapur, Bihar.<br>
          <br>
          IQ in inbred children (8-12 years old) is found to be lower
          (69 in rural and 79 in suburban populations) than that of the
          outbred ones (79 and 95 respectively). The onset of various
          social profiles like visual fixation, social smile, sound
          seizures, oral expression and hand-grasping are significantly
          delayed among the new-born inbred babies." (Indian National
          Science Academy, 1983 Consanguinity Effects on Intelligence
          Quotient and Neonatal Behaviours of nsari Muslim Children").<br>
          <br>
          The article "Effects of inbreeding on Raven Matrices"
          concludes that "Indian Muslim school boys, ages 13 to 15
          years, whose parents are first cousins, were compared with
          classmates whose parents are genetically unrelated on the
          Raven Standard Progressive Matrices, a nonverbal test of
          intelligence. The inbred group scored significantly lower and
          had significantly greater variance than the non-inbred group,
          both on raw scores and on scores statistically adjusted to
          control for age and socioeconomic status." (Behaviour
          Genetics, 1984).<br>
          <br>
          Another study shows that the risk of having an IQ lower than
          70 goes up 400 percent from 1.2 percent in children from
          normal parents to 6.2 percent in inbred children: "The data
          indicate that the risk for mental retardation in matings of
          normal parents increases from 0.012 with random matings to
          0.062 for first-cousin parentage." (Proceedings of the
          National Academy of Science, 1978 Effect of inbreeding on IQ
          and mental retardation"). The study A study of possible
          deleterious effects of consanguinity concludes, that "The
          occurrence of malignancies, congenital abnormalities, mental
          retardation and physical handicap was significantly higher in
          offspring of consanguineous than non-consanguineous
          marriages."<br>
          <br>
          <b> Mental and physical diseases and death</b><br>
          <b> </b><br>
          <b> </b>The risk of stillbirth doubles when parents are first
          cousins (Jyllands-Posten, 27/2 2009 More stillbirths among
          immigrants). One study analyzed the risk of perinatal death
          (the child dies during its own birth), infant death (child
          dies while still infant) and autosomal recessive disorders
          (serious and often deadly genetic diseases such as cystic
          fibrosis and spinal muscular atrophy):<br>
          <br>
          "Perinatal mortality in the Pakistani children was 1.5 times
          higher than that in the Norwegian children, and infant
          mortality in the Pakistani children was more than double that
          in the Norwegian children. Deaths due to autosomal recessive
          disorders were 18 times more common in the Pakistani children.
          Similarly, deaths due to multiple malformations, which may be
          part of unrecognized autosomal recessive syndromes, were 10
          times more common."<br>
          <b> </b><br>
          <b> </b>(BMJ, 1994 Infant death and consanguineous marriage.)<br>
          <br>
          There are also evidence suggesting that inbred people has a
          higher risk of developing mental disorders: "The clinical
          observations indicated that depression is very high in some
          communities where the consanguinity of marriages is also
          high." (Indian Journal of Psychiatry, 2009 "Relationship
          between consanguinity and depression in a south Indian
          population".<br>
          <br>
          Another study focused on the relationship between
          intermarriage and schizophrenia: "The closer the blood
          relative, the more likely was there to be a schizophrenic
          illness." (American Psychiatric Press, 1982 The role of
          genetic factors&nbsp; in the ethiology of the schizophrenic
          disorders.<br>
          <br>
          The increased risk of insanity among children of marriages
          between cousins might explain why immigrant patients are
          stressing the psychiatric system and are strongly
          overrepresented among insane criminals: "In Sct. Hans
          Hospital, which has the biggest ward for clinically insane
          criminals in Denmark, more than 40 percent of the patients
          have an immigrant background." (Kristeligt Dagblad, 26/6 2007
          Ethnic minorities overrepresented among the criminal insane).<br>
          <br>
          <b>Implications for the Western and the Muslim World</b><br>
          <b> </b><br>
          <b> </b>The consequences for offspring of consanguineous
          marriages are unpleasantly clear: Death, low intelligence or
          even mental retardation, handicaps and diseases often leading
          to a slow and painful death. Other consequences are:<br>
          <br>
          Limited social skills and understanding, limited ability to
          manage education and work procedures and painful treatment
          procedures. The negative cognitive consequences also influence
          the executive functions. The impairment of concentration and
          emotional control most often leads to anti-social behavior.<br>
          <br>
          The economic costs and consequences for society of inbreeding
          are of course secondary to the reality of human suffering.<br>
          <br>
          However, inbreeding among Muslims has severe implications for
          both the Western societies and the Muslim world.<br>
          <br>
          Expenses related to mentally and physically handicapped Muslim
          immigrants drains the budget for other public services: "When
          cousins have children together, they are twice as likely to
          have a disabled child - it costs municipal funds dearly.
          Disabled immigrant children costs Danish municipalities
          millions. In Copenhagen County alone, the number of disabled
          children in the overall increase of 100 percent at 10 years.
          ... Meredith Lefelt has contacted 330 families with disabled
          children in Copenhagen. She estimates that one third of their
          clients have a foreign cultural background." (BT, 10/11 2003
          Immigrants inbreeding costing one million.<br>
          <br>
          On top come the expenses for Muslim immigrants who - because
          of different consequences of being born from blood related
          parents - are not able to live up to the challenges of our
          Western work market: Muslim immigrants and their descendants
          in Europe have a very high rate of unemployment.<br>
          <br>
          The same goes for Muslims in USA, where the Gallup Institute
          made a study involving 300.000 people concluding “The majority
          of Muslims in USA have a lower income, are less educated and
          have worse jobs than the population as a whole.” (Berlingske
          Tidende, d. 3. marts 2009: Muslims thrive in USA.<br>
          <br>
          The cognitive consequences of Muslim inbreeding might explain
          why non-Western immigrants are more than 300 percent more
          likely to fail the Danish army's intelligence test than native
          Danes: "19.3% of non-Western immigrants are not able to pass
          the Danish army's intelligence test. In comparison, only 4.7%
          of applicants with Danish background do not pass." (TV 2
          Nyhederne, 13/6 2007 Immigrants flunk army test.<br>
          <br>
          It probably also explains - at least partly - why two thirds
          of all immigrant school children with Arabic backgrounds are
          illiterate after 10 years in the Danish school system: "Those
          who speak Arabic with their parents have an extreme tendency
          to lack reading abilities - 64 percent are illiterate. ... No
          matter if it concerns reading abilities, mathematics or
          science, the pattern is the same: The bilingual (largely
          Muslim) immigrants' skills are exceedingly poor compared to
          their Danish classmates." (Rockwool Foundation Research Unit,
          May 2007: Ethnic students does not make Danish children worse.<br>
          <br>
          The high expenses on special education for slow learners
          consumes one third of the budget for the Danish schools.
          “Immigrant children are clearly overrepresented on
          Copenhagen’s schools for retarded children and children with
          physical handicaps. … 51 percent of the children on the three
          schools in Copenhagen for children with physical and mental
          handicaps har immigrant back ground and on one of the schools
          the amount is 70 percent. … These amounts are significantly
          higher than the share of immigrant children in the
          municipality, which is 33 percent. The many handicapped
          children are a clear evidence that there are many intermarried
          parents in the immigrant families.” (Jydske Vestkysten, 4/4
          2009 Tosprogede i overtal på handicapskoler).<br>
          <br>
          Our high level of education may also make it harder for inbred
          students to follow and finish their studies: "Young people
          with minority backgrounds have a significantly higher dropout
          rate at secondary schools than youth with a Danish background.
          For trade school education, the dropout rate among immigrants
          is 60 percent, twice as high among adolescents with a Danish
          background....<br>
          <br>
          There is great variation in educational outcomes when compared
          with national origin. For example, dropout among young people
          with Lebanese or Iranian background is far greater than among
          people of Vietnamese background." (Center for Knowledge on
          Integration in Randers, May 2005 “Youth, education and
          integration“). ”Among immigrant children that are born and
          raised in Denmark, more than a third has no education. Among
          native Danes it is less than one fifth that do not get an
          education. (Statistics Denmark: “Indvandrere i 2007”.<br>
          <br>
          The negative consequences of inbreeding are also vast for the
          Muslim world. Inbreeding may thus explain why only nine
          Muslims ever managed to receive the prestigious Nobel Prize (5
          of them won the "Peace Prize" - for peace that turned out not
          to last for very long).<br>
          <br>
          The limited ability to understand, appreciate and produce
          knowledge following a limited IQ is probably also partly the
          reason why Muslim countries produce 1/10 of the World average
          when it comes to scientific research: "In 2003, the world
          average for production of articles per million inhabitants was
          137, whereas none of the 47 OIC countries for which there were
          data achieved production above 107 per million inhabitants.
          The OIC average was just 13." (Nature 444, p. 26-27, 1.
          November 2006 ”Islam and science: The data gap”.<br>
          <br>
          The lack of interest in science and human development in the
          Muslim World is also clear in the UN Arab Human Development
          Reports (AHDR). AHDR concludes that there have been fewer
          books translated into Arabic in the last thousand years than
          the amount of books translated within the country of Spain
          every year:<br>
          <br>
          "The Arab world translates about 330 books annually, one fifth
          of the number that Greece translates. The cumulative total of
          translated books since the Caliph Maa'moun's [sic] time (the
          ninth century) is about 100,000, almost the average that Spain
          translates in one year." (Eugene Rogan ”Arab Books and human
          development”. Index of Censorship, vol. 33, issue 2 April
          2004, p. 152-157). "70 percent of the Turkish citizens never
          read books."(APA, 23 February 2009 “).<br>
          <br>
          <b>Conclusion</b><br>
          <b> </b><br>
          <b> </b>There is no doubt that the wide spread tradition of
          first cousin marriages among Muslims has harmed the gene pool
          among Muslims. Because Muslims’ religious beliefs prohibit
          marrying non-Muslims and thus prevents them from adding fresh
          genetic material to their population, the genetic damage done
          to their gene pool since their prophet allowed first cousin
          marriages 1,400 years ago are most likely massive. The
          overwhelming direct and indirect human and societal
          consequences have been explained above.<br>
          <br>
          Compassion for the health of future generations should be
          enough to ban intermarriage among first cousins. The economic
          and societal consequences do also count. Such a ban would also
          lessen Muslim immigration to the West because many Muslim
          families would like to be able to continue their practice of
          intermarriage in order to live up to cultural and religious
          traditions and keep wealth and power inside their family.<br>
          <br>
          A legislative ban on first cousin marriages is a logical and
          compassionate imperative for both the Muslim world, for EU and
          our Western national governments.<br>

      Hi all,<br>
      <br>
      i recently found two primary sources i did not know before, that
      are explaining the key methods of Stan Meyers hyper efficient
      water molecule splitting method, where the energy is coming from
      and under what circumstances and what the thermal energy explosion
      is about. This should be enough info for everybody who sincerely
      wants to re engineer this most important and great technology.
      Stan used 40 KV DC pulses and restricts the current flow with a
      bifilar choke coil. The energy comes from the environment when a
      high voltage field drags the electron and proton circulation
      velocity because it wants to keep equilibrium. This may also be
      similar to the pulse motor technologies where the environment
      wants to keep the flow going on at switch off. The only thing i
      know of that could be even more simple to make a piston motor run
      on water may be the Papp method: let a spark ionize the air
      between two electrodes where then a lower voltage high amperage
      capacitor discharge could take place because the ionized air now
      can conduct the low voltage high amperage pulse and if water is
      present in this high amperage discharge you get your steam
      explosion energy.<br>
      <br>
      Here is the important presentation of Stan Meyer I did not see

      Inventor Gerard Morin has come up with what appears to be a
      possible variant of the QMoGen that may shed light on how the
      QMoGens work.<br>
      <br>
      He says he has been studying Tesla AC power for 15 years, with
      special focus in the past 10 months.<br>
      <br>
      He says it is not the same thing as typical AC current. He calls
      it "radiant watts" and says Tesla claimed, "Radiant Watts will not
      kill you."<br>
      <br>
      His system includes two 18-volt AC batteries (for recharging
      tools; 1.1 A-h), hooked up in series to make 32 volts; turns small
      motor ~4,000 rpm, which turns a small "modulator" (not
      "generator"), with no brushes, no friction; typically capable of
      30 watts.<br>
      <br>
      "I'm making the current manifest itself. It's natural energy --
      pure electrons." <br>
      <br>
      His demonstrations include:<br>
      <br>
      Powering 1000 lumens LED bulb designed for 120-V, 60 Hz<br>
      Powers pancake 60-V, DC motor, with brushes, experimental, from
      China, rated at 500-W output requiring 2,000 W input to power it,
      with DC volts and 20 Amps. With a step-up transformer, Gerard
      powers it with his small generator, turning it at ~4600 rpm.<br>
      Two step-up transformers (double-stepping), produces 400,000 V,
      shown by arcing.<br>
      Running the current/power through himself, he powers a fish tank
      bulb. <br>
      Burned out fluorescent bulbs/tubes light up.<br>
      Heats up Ceramic(?) magnets to over 200 F using voltage. <br>
      <br>
      Adds a set of magnets to two sides of the motor, and the output
      changes from 136 V to 154 V.<br>
      <br>
      Says a higher power magnet arrangement could power his house.<br>
      <br>
      "There's no patent involved. This technology has to go to
      everybody in the world." [1] <br>
      <br>
      The heart of the "modulator" is a ceramic magnet. It just entails
      oscillation of a magnetic field, spinning at a high rate to create
      the oscillation.<br>
      <br>
      "It's really easy to do." <br>

      Kudos for the commitment, passion and efforts. However this is
      another sad tale of mis-measurement, and a real lack of
      understanding of what is really going on…<br>
      <br>
      <b>From the Comments :</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      "He has discovered reactive power, "OU in VARs", that's all.
      Perhaps he'll be able to buy an oscilloscope and learn how to use
      it, or even an actual laboratory power analyzer. What I can't
      figure out is just where all the money is coming from. When I
      think of what I could do with that kind of "sugar daddy" funding,
      it almost drives me to tears…<br>
      <br>
      "I can readily use bits of mechanical kit to increase
      instantaneous power. I am put out if the goal is to increase
      sustained average power, IE energy…"<br>
      <br>
      "Well, if you really want to confuse people, try using a
      transformer as a magnetic amplifier. No--it doesn't create any
      energy, but by operating a transformer with a substantial DC bias
      such that the core is operating near saturation, you can realize a
      large change in output power with a comparatively small control
      signal. None of this, of course, is remotely new. Magnetic
      amplifiers have been used for industrial control for decades --
      they're extremely reliable and tolerate harsh operating
      conditions."<br>
      <br>
      "But I'm still waiting for one of the free-energy scammers to make
      use of the principle."<br>
      <br>
      "Steorn's Waterways demonstration with their "core effect" motor
      was such a device. They timed saturating the toroid core as the
      rotor magnet passed so that the force versus distance was
      asymmetric approaching versus leaving the toroid core."<br>
      <br>
      "That's right, and they produced their "overunity" electrical
      measurements by misusing about 50 thousand dollars worth of
      oscilloscope+differential voltage probes+current probes, by not
      accounting for the time constants of the active probes. They did
      not deskew their probe measurements, so the instantaneous power
      values calculated from them were garbage, and the integration of
      those values over time was also garbage."<br>
      <br>
      "I am trained in electricity/electronics for ~55 years and still
      work daily in these fields.<br>
      I assure you that we were not 'spoon-fed' these matters but had
      hands-on lab experiments to confirm the theory.<br>
      Mr. Morin is completely off in his theoretical and practical
      understanding of what's going on. Referring to Tesla is a cop-out;
      Tesla was a genius AND he was wrong sometimes, and/or did not
      explain himself as well as it could have been done. He has
      attained almost a God-like state."<br>
      <br>
      "Morin's not interested in learning, he already knows he's right
      and that his critics are just too stupid to understand what he's
      doing. Any measurements that don't confirm his "theory" are wrong,
      QED. He's had ample opportunity to perform actual experiments, to
      use proper test equipment properly and to understand the vagaries
      of the kit that he is using. He simply won't do it. Will he
      purchase and use a proper power analyzer as part of his laboratory
      kit? Why should he? Those instruments show that his scheme
      produces _no_ OU, so they must be defective and simply cannot
      account for all the OU "radiant" that he's producing.<br>
      I've seen Morin point his IR thermometer at a pole pig up on the
      pole, and claim that his readings show decreased temperature. He
      doesn't even understand that the laser isn't doing the temperature
      reading and that, at that long range, the measured spot is nowhere
      near where the laser is pointing. He's measuring blue Canadian sky
      and claiming it shows a cooling pole pig!"<br>

      <div align="center"><big><b>The Drone Papers</b><br>
        </big></div>
      &nbsp;<br>
      The Intercept has obtained a cache of secret slides that provides
      a window into the inner workings of the U.S. military’s
      kill/capture operations at a key time in the evolution of the
      drone wars — between 2011 and 2013. The documents, which also
      outline the internal views of special operations forces on the
      shortcomings and flaws of the drone program, were provided by a
      source within the intelligence community who worked on the types
      of operations and programs described in the slides. The Intercept
      granted the source’s request for anonymity because the materials
      are classified and because the U.S. government has engaged in
      aggressive prosecution of whistleblowers. The stories in this
      series will refer to the source as “the source.”<br>
      <br>
      The source said he decided to provide these documents to The
      Intercept because he believes the public has a right to understand
      the process by which people are placed on kill lists and
      ultimately assassinated on orders from the highest echelons of the
      U.S. government. “This outrageous explosion of watchlisting — of
      monitoring people and racking and stacking them on lists,
      assigning them numbers, assigning them ‘baseball cards,’ assigning
      them death sentences without notice, on a worldwide battlefield —
      it was, from the very first instance, wrong,” the source said.
      “We’re allowing this to happen. And by ‘we,’ I mean every American
      citizen who has access to this information now, but continues to
      do nothing about it.”<br>
      <br>
      The Pentagon, White House, and Special Operations Command all
      declined to comment. A Defense Department spokesperson said, “We
      don’t comment on the details of classified reports.”<br>
      <br>
      The CIA and the U.S. military’s Joint Special Operations Command
      (JSOC) operate parallel drone-based assassination programs, and
      the secret documents should be viewed in the context of an intense
      internal turf war over which entity should have supremacy in those
      operations. Two sets of slides focus on the military’s high-value
      targeting campaign in Somalia and Yemen as it existed between 2011
      and 2013, specifically the operations of a secretive unit, Task
      Force 48-4.<br>
      <br>
      Additional documents on high-value kill/capture operations in
      Afghanistan buttress previous accounts of how the Obama
      administration masks the true number of civilians killed in drone
      strikes by categorizing unidentified people killed in a strike as
      enemies, even if they were not the intended targets. The slides
      also paint a picture of a campaign in Afghanistan aimed not only
      at eliminating al Qaeda and Taliban operatives, but also at taking
      out members of other local armed groups.<br>
      <br>
      One top-secret document shows how the terror “watchlist” appears
      in the terminals of personnel conducting drone operations, linking
      unique codes associated with cellphone SIM cards and handsets to
      specific individuals in order to geolocate them.<br>

      No one really knows the true cause of autism, but the numbers are
      rising, with approximately 1 in 50 school-aged children in the
      United States diagnosed with autism (2011). Taking into account
      that in 2007 this ratio was at 1 in 87 children, by 2025 it is
      predicted that half of United States children will have autism.<br>
      <br>
      Effective treatment for autism is desperately needed, but the
      medical establishment has been largely unsuccessful. This is why
      parents of autistic children, such as Kerri Rivera, often have no
      choice but to take matters into their own hands when learning to
      cope with raising an autistic child. To share her amazing
      discoveries in treating autism with the world she wrote the book
      Healing the Symptoms Known as Autism, which explains the treatment
      protocol she developed.<br>
      <br>
      Rivera developed the Chlorine Dioxide (CD) autism treatment
      protocol that addresses the presence of pathogens, such as fungi,
      bacteria, heavy metals, parasites, candida, etc., found in almost
      every child with autism. She believes that CD treatment
      effectively kills off these pathogens that are causing
      inflammation and autoimmune response, which in turn manifest
      themselves into a complex of symptoms, which we call autism, that
      produce near complete impairment of social interactions.<br>
      <br>
      Rivera’s treatment has reportedly resulted in the recovery of over
      one hundred autistic children, and many parents would even
      consider her protocol to a possible autism cure.<br>
      <br>
      In her book, Rivera states:<br>
      <br>
      "Today more than 115 children globally have lost their diagnosis
      of autism (meaning an ATEC&nbsp; score of under 10 points).
      Additionally, thousands of children around the globe have dropped
      points on their ATEC and are moving towards recovery. 27 children
      in less than 1 year in Venezuela alone lost their diagnosis of
      autism with a combination of diet, CD, and ocean water to the
      surprise of the doctors who diagnosed them in the first place.
      Many of those same doctors are now looking at CD for other
      patients."<br>
      <br>
      Dr. Lorna B. Oritz, President of Curando el Autismo, a non-profit
      organization dedicated to bringing information about successful
      autism treatments in Spanish to Hispanic families, believes Rivera
      is one of the first courageous leaders who have dedicated their
      lives to understanding the mysterious connection between the
      immune system, the brain and human behavior.<br>
      <br>
      “Kerri’s protocols have been indispensable to the full recovery of
      many of the kids in our Cuarando de Autismo Foundation. These
      protocols represent a readily available and effective solution to
      alleviate most of the pathogenic insults to the immune system.”<br>
      <br>
      Why are potential solutions such as Rivera’s treatment for autism
      often ignored or ridiculed by the medical establishment?<br>
      <br>
      Currently, there is no mainstream support for research into why CD
      helps treat the symptoms known as autism. The medical
      establishment is profit centered and acceptable treatments and
      cures must pass through an impossible maze of corporate competion
      and goverment red tape. Simple, affordable solutions to complex
      problems are not elevated and promoted in this environment. These
      types of solutions continue to also find it difficult to receive
      approval among medical journals, which by the way are compromised
      and increasingly funded by drug companies.<br>
      <br>
      Here’s Rivera’s take:<br>
      <br>
      "The development of this protocol has been a growing grass roots
      effort, in sharp contrast to how modern medicine usually works.
      The reason for this is clear: Modern medicine has not really
      helped to heal autism and may very well be part of its cause.
      While we don’t have any double blind studies to rest on, we do
      have a slew of anecdotal evidence, which may not mean much to
      those in the arena of modern medicine or modern science, that
      doesn’t make it any less real."<br>
      <br>
      Grass roots movements such as the parents following Rivera’s CD
      treatment for autism are becoming more common and are creating a
      paradigm shift in the way that the world views the role of
      mainstream medicine in treating autism. Many in the medical
      profession scrutinize this type of behavior and even regard it as
      dangerous. Perhaps if medical researchers were more keen on
      evaluating all possible treatments not just those that are sure to
      result in giant profits, parents would have less need to find
      their own solutions to living with children with autism.<br>

      Inventor : Daniel Stamm<br>
      <br>
      The invention relates to a liquid prepared to visualize the
      movement of the liquid or the movement in the cash.<br>
      [0002]<br>
      <br>
      The present patent application refers to a called
      Wirbelstrassenrad device for visualizing the motion of the liquid,
      for example aqueous.<br>
      For this purpose, a rotatably mounted, flat chamber with a
      prepared liquid is filled.<br>
      The chamber has side panels and a central part of at least
      partially transparent material.<br>
      To form the chamber, the middle part is provided with an interior
      designed recess.<br>
      Under the inner recess is designed such a recess to understand
      that having a substantially wavy structure in the interior of the
      chamber, thereby forming subdivisions or undercuts.<br>
      The prepared liquid passes by means of a feed in the form of a
      valve in the cavity thus forming the chamber and fills this almost
      completely.<br>
      [0003]<br>
      <br>
      The valve has two holes, one for filling and the other for the
      venting of the chamber.<br>
      [0004]<br>
      <br>
      The subdivisions mentioned or<br>
      Undercuts effect the transporting and forwarding the remaining
      amount of air, or in general of a gas remaining in the chamber
      after this has been filled with the liquid.<br>
      The subdivisions may be preferably in the form of 3, 5, or 9-7er
      be formed undercuts, ie there are provided circumferentially
      distributed three, five, seven or nine undercuts.<br>
      In principle, even finer subdivisions larger nine are possible.<br>
      [0005]<br>
      <br>
      The side parts and the middle part have, for.<br>
      B. a circular cross-section.<br>
      The middle part is formed in this embodiment as designed to the
      inside annulus having the undercuts.<br>
      It is not necessarily a circular configuration necessary.<br>
      For example, the device can.<br>
      B. also an oval shape can be selected.<br>
      [0006]<br>
      <br>
      The transparent material from which the chamber is formed may be
      selected from glass or plastic.<br>
      When plastic is noted, however, that this possible is not prone to
      the liquid as it is in particular water, to let diffuse out.<br>
      That meant an evaporation of water from the device, which should
      be avoided.<br>
      [0007]<br>
      <br>
      Among the prepared liquid is understood to mean such a liquid,
      which can make the liquid in movement or the movement of the
      liquid visible.<br>
      For this, the liquid is to be put in a position, the movement of
      gas bubbles such.<br>
      B. air bubbles to map in the liquid.<br>
      There are bubbles that act and the liquid, for example, the
      prepared water reacts.<br>
      It is the liquid which is caused by the bubbles in motion, and the
      prepared fluid makes this operation visible.<br>
      [0008]<br>
      <br>
      To achieve this, the liquid is prepared in such a way that water
      color, finely divided silver and / or coal dust are homogeneously
      dispersed in water or another liquid.<br>
      These particles cause then the visualization of the movement of
      gas or air bubbles are trapped in the chamber.<br>
      The liquid can also be cooling oil from the tool shop.<br>
      Liquids can be adapted to reflect its forms of movement or to show
      no further additions.<br>
      You can also consist of mixtures of two or more constituents.<br>
      [0009]<br>
      <br>
      Movement in liquid or the movement of the liquid in this
      Wirbelstrassenrad is visualized by rotating the vortex street
      wheel.<br>
      Previously, the liquid of the rotatable chamber of substantially
      transparent material was supplied so that the liquid chamber
      almost completely fills.<br>
      The residual gas, preferably the residual air is transported to a
      lower position in the chamber from an upper position and then
      discharged as a gas or air bubbles.<br>
      The bubbles rise to the top and the prepared liquid is thereby set
      in motion.<br>
      That which is in addition to the liquid remaining in the chamber
      air or gas transported by rotating the chamber slowly from an
      upper in a lower portion of this chamber, discharged in the lower
      region, where the bubbles displace the liquid in movement when
      ascending.<br>
      This will now be visualized with the aid of the prepared liquid.<br>
      [0010]<br>
      <br>
      Assuming the present invention was based on the object to further
      improve the prepared liquid for the visualization of the movement
      of the movement or in liquids such as water, and optimize.<br>
      [0011]<br>
      <br>
      This object is achieved by a liquid prepared on the basis of at
      least a liquid medium with a viscosity greater than water, in
      combination with one hand, light to white appearing particles and
      on the other hand dark to black appearing particles.<br>
      [0012]<br>
      <br>
      Thus the movement of the liquid or the movement can be visualized
      in the liquid with the particles contained in the liquid medium is
      necessary to speak of two poles light and dark as a contrast.<br>
      [0013]<br>
      <br>
      This will be explained again with reference to the device
      described at the outset, called Wirbelstrassenrad.<br>
      The prepared liquid is the rotatable chamber so fed that the
      liquid chamber almost completely fills.<br>
      There remains only the already mentioned residual gas, preferably
      the residual air present.<br>
      This is conveyed by rotating the vortex street wheel in the
      chamber from an upper position to a lower position and then
      discharged as a gas or air bubbles, the bubbles rise to the top
      and the prepared liquid is thereby set in motion.<br>
      This movement is now made visible by means of the inventively
      prepared liquid.<br>
      By the light- be moved up white shiny particles together with the
      dark to black particles in the movement of ascent of bubbles in
      the liquid, resulting in a iridescent image in the form of
      streaks.<br>
      If the viscosity of the liquid medium increases, thereby the
      movement becomes slow at the UP-Rise of the bubbles and the effect
      of traversing the image in the form of streaks becomes clearer and
      more visible.<br>
      This effect is for each increase in viscosity to monitor more or
      less, according to the increase in viscosity which is higher than
      that of water, and otherwise does not affect the efficacy of the
      prepared liquid and visualizing the movement of the liquid.<br>
      [0014]<br>
      <br>
      According to one embodiment, the liquid medium at least having a
      component which is selected from an oil, preferably a colorless
      oil, in order to achieve a viscosity of the prepared fluid, which
      is greater than that of water.<br>
      As such an oil, which was used for experimental purposes, is
      exemplary cooling oil to name from the tool shop.<br>
      [0015]<br>
      <br>
      According to a further embodiment may comprise at least two
      components of the liquid medium selected from water and a
      viscosity enhancer.<br>
      When viscosity enhancer is z.<br>
      B. Hypromellose (HPMC) to call.<br>
      These hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose, Hypromellosum PhEur 6, is a
      partially methylated and partially O-O- (2-hydroxypropylated)
      cellulose.<br>
      HPMC dissolves in cold water to form a colloidal solution.<br>
      This hydrocolloid serves as a viscosity enhancer.<br>
      Furthermore, to name as a viscosity enhancer glycerin.<br>
      Then, the liquid medium comprises at least two components selected
      from water and glycerol.<br>
      Glycerin is available in different qualities and thus viscosities.<br>
      It has the advantage of being completely miscible with water.<br>
      Commercially especially 85% sodium glycerin available.<br>
      But of 80% glycerol is known, which is used mainly for animal
      feed.<br>
      In addition, 99.5% is to obtain sodium glycerol, which is mainly
      referred to as anhydrous.<br>
      There are also glycerine water, including a 10% glycerol is to be
      understood.<br>
      Its use is primarily known from the medical field.<br>
      All of the above glycerin compositions are generally suitable for
      use in the context of the present invention prepared liquid, in
      the case of glycerol waters both mentioned components, the water
      and the viscosity enhancer, in which 10% glycerol are included as
      the glycerin water.<br>
      [0016]<br>
      <br>
      The light to white appearing particles of the inventive prepared
      fluid may be selected from silver, aluminum powder, aluminum
      flakes or compositions containing them, in particular pigment
      powder and pastes.<br>
      The aforementioned pigment powders and pastes are primarily those
      to call with lamellar aluminum pigments and preferably reflecting
      the incident light on its surface.<br>
      This reflection leads to an excellent, very significant effect
      when visualizing the movement of the liquid or the movement in the
      liquid according to the invention as desired.<br>
      The platelet-shaped light to white appearing particles, as used in
      the present invention, comes to the optical effect of light
      reflection added yet of the refraction of light.<br>
      This interplay of reflection and refraction results in a unique
      amplifying the motion pictures inventively produced.<br>
      This applies to the platelet-shaped aluminum pigments as well as
      for the above-mentioned silver particles, when they are used in
      flake form.<br>
      [0017]<br>
      <br>
      The dark to black appearing particles of this invention are
      prepared liquid are preferably selected from finely divided
      carbon, preferably carbon powder.<br>
      [0018]<br>
      <br>
      In the following the invention using an exemplary embodiment and
      the accompanying drawings will be explained in more detail.<br>
      [0019]<br>
      <br>
      The sole figure:<br>
      FIG. 1: &lt;sep&gt; A in the chamber of a vortex street wheel
      arising using the inventive prepared liquid motion picture, shown
      as top view of the disk-shaped cross section of the vortex street
      wheel.<br>
      [0020]<br>
      <br>
      The initially described, pivoted flat chamber from the side parts
      and the central part of at least partially transparent material is
      with the inventive prepared liquid filled in the manner explained
      below, makes it possible to represent moving images to visualize
      the movement of the liquid or the movement in the cash ,<br>
      [0021]<br>
      <br>
      Basically, the prepared liquid of two components, the liquid
      medium and the one hand, light to white appearing particles and on
      the other hand dark to black appearing particles.<br>
      The liquid medium is in the exemplary embodiment of<br>
      450 ml of water and<br>
      50 ml glycerol<br>
      produced.<br>
      As glycerol here of 80% glycerol is used, as is commercially
      available.<br>
      In this way, a liquid medium with ca.<br>
      10% glycerol.<br>
      Glycerin dissolves completely in the water.<br>
      Variations of this experimentation were made as that also used a
      85% sodium and glycerin, the proportions were modified in that the
      composition comprises between 50-90% by volume of water and 50-10%
      by volume of glycerol was varied.<br>
      Basically pronounced effects with higher glycerol concentrations
      due to the increase in viscosity yet been observed in the motion
      pictures.<br>
      [0022]<br>
      <br>
      The second component of the one hand, light to white appearing
      particles and the other, dark to black appearing particles was
      prepared as a suspension as follows:<br>
      300 ml of water were mixed with<br>
      20-30 ml watercolor paint, silver and<br>
      14 g carbon powder<br>
      thoroughly mixed by stirring.<br>
      [0023]<br>
      <br>
      As water, distilled water was used in each case at the two
      components of the prepared liquid on the one hand, the other hand,
      spring water from a gneiss or<br>
      Granite region.<br>
      Spring water from a limestone region proved to be unsuitable.<br>
      [0024]<br>
      <br>
      As a watercolor paint pots of company Liner was used which had the
      stated content of 20-30 ml.<br>
      This silver watercolor has aluminum platelets, which have the
      advantage that the carbon powder used as it does not settle and
      thus no "graying" of the aluminum causes which would entail
      reducing the effects in the motion pictures by itself.<br>
      This, too, has been found by means of corresponding parallel
      experiments.<br>
      [0025]<br>
      <br>
      It is important for the success of this invention, that the
      quality of light to white appearing (aluminum) is retained
      particles.<br>
      The (used here) aluminum may be in terms of the contrasts do not
      mix with the coal, or generally speaking, white and black are not
      allowed to mix in that they lead to a gray.<br>
      [0026]<br>
      <br>
      The thus produced, prepared liquid passes by means of a feed in
      the form of a valve into the cavity of the chamber and fills this
      almost completely.<br>
      The valve has two bores which serve for filling the chamber and
      for venting.<br>
      [0027]<br>
      <br>
      The filling of the chamber was performed as follows:<br>
      First, the called Wirbelstrassenrad device is filled in shape of
      the chamber consists of two side parts and a cavity forming the
      actual central portion of a valve with said liquid medium.<br>
      The liquid medium fills the chamber almost completely.<br>
      Some residual air still present.<br>
      The two holes in the valve make the filling as the venting of the
      chamber possible.<br>
      In a Wirbelstrassenrad with a slice of about 60 cm in diameter
      about 0.81 volume content are expected.<br>
      In a Wirbelstrassenrad with a slice of about 50 cm diameter is
      approximately 0.51 Content.<br>
      Now be taken from the separately prepared suspension of water,
      watercolor and charcoal 10ml via syringe with the appropriate
      volume and injected through the valve into the chamber of the
      device.<br>
      It should be ensured that the chamber in such a way (only) is
      almost completely filled, so that the already mentioned residual
      air still present.<br>
      By turning the wheel vortex street, the liquid medium and the
      suspension are mixed together.<br>
      The residual air present in the chamber will now be transported at
      the turning of the vortex street wheel from an upper position to a
      lower position.<br>
      Serve this purpose the said subdivisions or<br>
      Undercuts of the central part.<br>
      This residual air is then discharged as air bubbles, the bubbles
      rise to the top and the prepared liquid is thereby set in motion.<br>
      The present in the liquid light to white shiny particles are moved
      along with the dark to black particles in the movement of ascent
      of the bubbles and provide a variety of motion pictures in the
      form of streaks.<br>
      Visualization of the movement of the liquid or the movement in the
      cash is reached.<br>

      <b><br>
      </b>A team of researchers working at the University of Konstanz,
      in Germany is claiming to have directly sampled electric-field
      vacuum fluctuations, which would be the first ever made. In their
      paper published in the journal Science, the team describes an
      experiment they carried out and a part of it which they claim
      indicates that they have measured vacuum fluctuations directly for
      the first time...<br>
      <br>
      The experiment conducted by the team in Germany involved using a
      long pulse of light to study a shorter pulse of light by firing
      both through a crystal at the same time. The long pulse had a
      horizontal polarization while the shorter pulse had a vertical
      polarization. In such an arrangement, properties of the crystal
      are dependent on the electric field that exists inside of it,
      which in turn causes a change in the polarization of the beams
      that are fired into it and then emerge on the other side. The
      researchers adjusted the timing of the light pulses to map out
      fluctuations in the electric field. To offset vacuum fluctuations
      related to their own existence, they put in just the probe
      pulse—nothing else. When repeated many times, the researchers
      found the polarization varied slightly, which the researchers
      attributed to vacuum fluctuations. To be able to actually see what
      was going on, the team varied the width and duration of the pulses
      but not the number of photons in a given beam. They noted that the
      shot noise should have stayed constant as the pulse grew in size,
      but it did not, which the team claims was due to electric-field
      vacuum fluctuations.<br>

        ABSTRACT -- </b>The ground state of quantum systems is
      characterized by zero-point motion. Those vacuum fluctuations are
      generally deemed an elusive phenomenon that manifests itself only
      indirectly. Here, we report direct detection of the vacuum
      fluctuations of electromagnetic radiation in free space. The
      ground-state electric field variance is found to be inversely
      proportional to the four-dimensional space-time volume sampled
      electro-optically with tightly focused few-femtosecond laser
      pulses. Sub-cycle temporal readout and nonlinear coupling far from
      resonance provide signals from purely virtual photons without
      amplification. Our findings enable an extreme time-domain approach
      to quantum physics with nondestructive access to the quantum state
      of light. Operating at multi-terahertz frequencies, such
      techniques might also allow time-resolved studies of intrinsic
      fluctuations of elementary excitations in condensed matter.<br>

      </b>What's more, Yasuhiro Iwamura, a former Mitsubishi Heavy
      Industries nuclear expert, now a specially-appointed professor at
      Tohoku University, joined the project in April. The research team
      has embarked on the following nuclear transmutations: turning
      radioactive palladium, which emits beta rays for hundreds of
      thousands of years, into radiation-free and stable tin;
      transforming radioactive selenium into stable strontium; changing
      radioactive zirconium into ruthenium; and turning radioactive
      cesium into praseodymium, which has a half-life of only 13.6 days.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Experts say that the radioactive
      materials listed above are the most challenging to process among
      nuclear power plant byproducts. The government has selected the
      research team's method, aimed at turning nuclear waste into
      radiation-free material, as one of the project candidates for its
      Impulsing Paradigm Change through Disruptive Technologies
      (ImPACT), a program of government-sponsored research launched in
      2014.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More than 10 institutions, including
      Tohoku University and Mitsubishi Heavy, are taking part in the
      nuclear transmutation research project, partially funded by
      ImPACT. The research focuses on hitting radioactive material with
      neutrons to change the number of neutrons inside atomic nuclei so
      that the material will not emit radiation. However, until now,
      only large-scale facilities have been able to generate and
      accelerate the neutrons used in the transmutation process.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus, Kasagi and other researchers have
      decided to conduct research triggering nuclear transmutation
      through reactions between radioactive materials and deuterium gas
      or hydrogen gas, a far simpler method.<b><br>
        <br>
        Popular research<br>
        <br>
      </b>Research in the area of nuclear transmutation became popular
      more than two decades ago. In 1989, scientists in the U.S. and
      U.K. demonstrated the possibility of nuclear transmutation with
      their test results. They pointed to the possibility of
      low-temperature fusion of hydrogen atoms. This is why the process
      was known as cold fusion at that time.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Originally, nuclear fusion was referred
      to as "a sun on the earth" because experts believed that it could
      only occur at Celsius temperatures in the millions. The discovery
      of cold fusion was a worldwide sensation. Nevertheless, the
      original presenters were not nuclear experts and the data from
      their experiments was found to contain errors. As a result, their
      findings were discredited and many scientists ended their research
      in the area.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Researchers around the world were vying
      to replicate this with their own experiments and some of them
      produced new findings," said Kasagi. "But some papers were not
      based on thorough arguments and paper assessments were not always
      rigorously done." He added that the scientific community ceased
      accepting papers on the topic.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet, Kasagi stressed the importance of
      his continued research. "Since we have data that defies nuclear
      science's conventional knowledge, I think I need to try and
      understand the mechanism," he said.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; People engaged in the business of&nbsp;
      nuclear power didn't believe in the possibility of cold fusion
      back then, said Iwamoto. "But we need the technology for
      transforming radioactive waste into safe matter."<br>

            chain collapse</b></big><br>
      </div>
      <b><br>
      </b>A world-first global analysis of marine responses to climbing
      human carbon dioxide emissions has painted a grim picture of
      future fisheries and ocean ecosystems. <br>
      <br>
      Published today in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy
      of Sciences (PNAS), marine ecologists from the University of
      Adelaide say the expected ocean acidification and warming is
      likely to produce a reduction in diversity and numbers of various
      key species that underpin marine ecosystems around the world.<br>
      <br>
      "This 'simplification' of our oceans will have profound
      consequences for our current way of life, particularly for coastal
      populations and those that rely on oceans for food and trade,"
      says Associate Professor Ivan Nagelkerken, Australian Research
      Council (ARC) Future Fellow with the University's Environment
      Institute.<br>
      <br>
      Associate Professor Nagelkerken and fellow University of Adelaide
      marine ecologist Professor Sean Connell have conducted a
      'meta-analysis' of the data from 632 published experiments
      covering tropical to artic waters, and a range of ecosystems from
      coral reefs, through kelp forests to open oceans.<br>
      <br>
      "We know relatively little about how climate change will affect
      the marine environment," says Professor Connell. "Until now, there
      has been almost total reliance on qualitative reviews and
      perspectives of potential global change. Where quantitative
      assessments exist, they typically focus on single stressors,
      single ecosystems or single species.<br>
      <br>
      "This analysis combines the results of all these experiments to
      study the combined effects of multiple stressors on whole
      communities, including species interactions and different measures
      of responses to climate change."<br>
      <br>
      The researchers found that there would be "limited scope" for
      acclimation to warmer waters and acidification. Very few species
      will escape the negative effects of increasing CO2, with an
      expected large reduction in species diversity and abundance across
      the globe. One exception will be microorganisms, which are
      expected to increase in number and diversity.<br>
      <br>
      From a total food web point of view, primary production from the
      smallest plankton is expected to increase in the warmer waters but
      this often doesn't translate into secondary production (the
      zooplankton and smaller fish) which shows decreased productivity
      under ocean acidification.<br>
      <br>
      "With higher metabolic rates in the warmer water, and therefore a
      greater demand for food, there is a mismatch with less food
      available for carnivores ─ the bigger fish that fisheries
      industries are based around," says Associate Professor
      Nagelkerken. "There will be a species collapse from the top of the
      food chain down."<br>
      <br>
      The analysis also showed that with warmer waters or increased
      acidification or both, there would be deleterious impacts on
      habitat-forming species for example coral, oysters and mussels.
      Any slight change in the health of habitats would have a broad
      impact on a wide range of species these reefs harbour.<br>

      Another finding was that acidification would lead to a decline in
      dimethylsulfide gas (DMS) production by ocean plankton which helps
      cloud formation and therefore in controlling Earth's heat
      exchange.<br>

      <b>Abstract<br>
        <br>
      </b>Rising anthropogenic CO2 emissions are anticipated to drive
      change to ocean ecosystems, but a conceptualization of biological
      change derived from quantitative analyses is lacking. Derived from
      multiple ecosystems and latitudes, our metaanalysis of 632
      published experiments quantified the direction and magnitude of
      ecological change resulting from ocean acidification and warming
      to conceptualize broadly based change. Primary production by
      temperate noncalcifying plankton increases with elevated
      temperature and CO2, whereas tropical plankton decreases
      productivity because of acidification. Temperature increases
      consumption by and metabolic rates of herbivores, but this
      response does not translate into greater secondary production,
      which instead decreases with acidification in calcifying and
      noncalcifying species. This effect creates a mismatch with
      carnivores whose metabolic and foraging costs increase with
      temperature. Species diversity and abundances of tropical as well
      as temperate species decline with acidification, with shifts
      favoring novel community compositions dominated by noncalcifiers
      and microorganisms. Both warming and acidification instigate
      reduced calcification in tropical and temperate reef-building
      species. Acidification leads to a decline in dimethylsulfide
      production by ocean plankton, which as a climate gas, contributes
      to cloud formation and maintenance of the Earth’s heat budget.
      Analysis of responses in short- and long-term experiments and of
      studies at natural CO2 vents reveals little evidence of
      acclimation to acidification or temperature changes, except for
      microbes. This conceptualization of change across whole
      communities and their trophic linkages forecast a reduction in
      diversity and abundances of various key species that underpin
      current functioning of marine ecosystems.<b><br>

            offers hope of cure for cancer</b></big><br>
      </div>
      <b><br>
      </b>A new Danish treatment can kill 95 percent of all cancer
      cells, say researchers, who expect to be able to test the method
      on people in a few years.<br>
      <br>
      "We have found a way to hit all types of cancer. If this is going
      to work, will be able to offer treatment to people where no
      treatment is today.<br>
      <br>
      So says Professor Ali Salanti from the Department of Immunology
      and Microbiology at the University of Copenhagen to DR News.<br>
      <br>
      Together with researchers from the University of British Columbia
      in Canada, his team found something that looks like the Holy Grail
      of medicine: A possible cure for cancer.<br>
      <br>
      Kills 95 percent of all cancer cells<br>
      <br>
      The discovery came a little random. While the researchers tried to
      find a way to cure so-called 'pregnancy malaria', which sits on
      the placenta in pregnant women, they found out that malaria
      protein also got stuck on cancer cells.<br>
      <br>
      The researchers gave the idea of ​​linking a toxin in a malaria
      protein, and then use the protein to identify cancer cells.<br>
      <br>
      "In this way works malaria protein like a heat-seeking missile. It
      goes simply into and bind to cancer tissue, and then makes the
      toxin cancer death, says Ali Salanti.<br>
      <br>
      Since then, the researchers tested the hypothesis on several test
      animals with different types of cancer. And the potential is not
      to be mistaken:<br>
      <br>
      "Our data from the last few years suggest that the treatment is
      effective against 95 percent of all cancers. So that is something
      that hits very, very broad, he told BBC News.<br>
      <br>
      Will create an inexpensive cancer cure<br>
      <br>
      If successful, this research team to develop a cancer treatment
      that works on people, so the treatment is not only reserved for
      the rich countries' most wealthy citizens, promises Ali Salanti.<br>
      <br>
      "here are a lot of big commercial interests when speaking about a
      potential general cure for cancer. But our goal is to make it
      here, so it will be a cheap product. It is our desire scenario.<br>
      <br>
      He expects that scientists are ready to test the new cancer drug
      on people within the next four years.<br>
      <br>
      If the treatment works, it will not only be able to cure almost
      all cancers. It will also be an effective vaccine against malaria
      - a disease that kills one child every minute.<b><br>

        A</b>dult hippocampal neurogenesis is closely associated with
      neuronal plasticity, cognitive function and the etiology of
      neurological diseases. We previously reported that the
      standardized ethanolic extract of Prunella vulgaris var. lilacina
      (EEPV) can be used for the prevention and treatment of cognitive
      impairments associated with Alzheimer's disease or schizophrenia.
      In the present study, we investigated the effects of EEPV on
      cognitive ability in normal naive mice and the underlying
      mechanism(s) governing these effects, including adult hippocampal
      neurogenesis. In the passive avoidance task, sub-chronic
      administration of EEPV (25 or 50 mg/kg, p.o.) for 14 days markedly
      induced the improvement of cognitive function in mice. In
      addition, sub-chronic administration of EEPV (25 or 50 mg/kg) for
      14 days significantly increased neural cell proliferation and the
      number of immature neurons, but not newly generated cell survival,
      in the hippocampal dentate gyrus. Increased ERK, Akt and GSK-3β
      phosphorylation levels in the hippocampus were also observed after
      such administration. Our results indicate that EEPV may enhance
      cognitive function via the activation of various intracellular
      signaling molecules and the up-regulation of adult hippocampal
      neurogenesis. <br>

        <br>
        <i>Scientists have discovered more than 200 genes linked to
          ageing and have found switching them off extends life </i><br>
        <br>
        <b>by <br>

          Sarah Knapton, Science Editor</b><br>

      <b>&nbsp;</b><br>
      The secret of extending life by decades may lie in switching off
      certain genes, scientists believe, after showing that small
      genetic tweaks can make organisms live 60 per cent longer.<br>
      <br>
      Ten years of research by the Buck Institute for Research on Ageing
      and the University of Washington has identified 238 genes that,
      when silenced, increase the lifespan of yeast cells.<br>
      <br>
      Many of the genes are present in mammals, including humans,
      suggesting that switching them off could dramatically increase
      lifespan.<br>
      <br>
      “This study looks at aging in the context of the whole genome and
      gives us a more complete picture of what aging is,” said lead
      author Dr Brian Kennedy.<br>
      <br>
      "Almost half of the genes we found that affect aging are conserved
      in mammals. <br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;"In theory, any of these factors could be therapeutic
      targets to extend healthspan. What we have to do now is figure out
      which ones are amenable to targeting.”<br>
      <br>
      To determine which genes were responsible for ageing, researchers
      examined 4,698 strains of yeast, each with a single gene deletion
      and then monitored how long cells lived for before they stopped
      dividing.<br>
      <br>
      They found that deleting a gene called LOS1 produced particularly
      impressive results, extending life by 60 per cent. LOS1 is linked
      to a genetic master switch which has long been associated with
      calorie restriction through fasting and increased lifespan.<br>
      <br>
      "Calorie restriction has been known to extend lifespan for a long
      time," added Dr. Kennedy.<br>
      <br>
      Co-author Dr Mark McCormick, of the Buck Institute said: "Our best
      results were single gene deletions that increased lifespan by
      around 60 per cent compared to normal yeast." <br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;Earlier this year academics from the University of Southern
      California found that a five day diet which mimics fasting can
      slow down ageing, add years to life, boost the immune system and
      cut the risk of heart disease and cancer.<br>
      <br>
      The plan restricts calories to between one third and a half of
      normal intake.<br>
      <br>
      Last year the same team discovered that fasting can regenerate the
      entire immune system, bringing a host of long-term health
      benefits.<br>
      <br>
      When humans tested out the regimen, within three months they had
      reduced biomarkers linked to ageing, diabetes, cancer and heart
      disease as well as cutting overall body fat.<br>
      <br>
      The researchers think it works by slashing a hormone which
      encourages growth, and has been linked to cancer susceptibility.
      Essentially it tricks the body into ageing more slowly.<br>
      <br>

        A</b> five day diet which mimics fasting could slow down ageing,
      add years to life, boost the immune system and cut the risk of
      heart disease and cancer, scientists believe.<br>
      <br>
      The plan which restricts calories to between one third and a half
      of normal intake has been developed by academics at the University
      of Southern California.<br>
      <br>
      Last year the same team discovered that fasting can regenerate the
      entire immune system, bringing a host of long-term health
      benefits.<br>
      <br>
      But now they have found that a calorie-restricted diet comprising
      of vegetable soups and chamomile tea has the same affect. And
      dieters only need to follow the Fasting Mimicking Diet (FMD) for
      five days a month, eating what they like for the rest of the time.<br>
      <br>
      “Strict fasting is hard for people to stick to, and it can also be
      dangerous, so we developed a complex diet that triggers the same
      effects in the body,' said Professor Valter Longo, USC Davis
      School of Gerontology and director of the USC Longevity Institute.<br>
      <br>
      “I've personally tried both, and the fasting mimicking diet is a
      lot easier and also a lot safer. <br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;“I think based on the markers for ageing and disease in
      humans it has the potential to add a number of years of life but
      more importantly to have a major impact on diabetes, cancer, heart
      disease and other age-related disease.”<br>
      <br>
      Day one of the diet comprises:<br>
      <br>
      10 per cent protein, 56 per cent fat and 34 per cent carbohydrate,
      making 1,090 calories<br>
      <br>
      Days two to five:<br>
      <br>
      Nine per cent protein, 44 per cent fat and 47 per cent
      carbohydrate making 725 calories<br>
      <br>
      When humans tested out the regimen, within three months they had
      reduced biomarkers linked to ageing, diabetes, cancer and heart
      disease as well as cutting overall body fat.<br>
      <br>
      For 25 days a month, study participants went back to their regular
      eating habits -- good or bad They were not asked to change their
      diet and still saw positive changes. <br>
      <br>
      eeding mice the equivalent restricted diet elevated the number of
      regenerative stem cells in the organs, including the brain where
      it encouraged the creation of new neurons which improved memory
      and learning.<br>

      When fed to middle aged mice, the diet also reduced the incidence
      of cancer, boosted the immune system, reduced inflammatory
      diseases, slowed bone mineral density loss and improved the
      cognitive abilities of older mice tracked in the study.<br>
      <br>
      The researchers think it works by slashing a hormone which
      encourages growth, and has been linked to cancer susceptibility.
      Essentially it tricks the body into ageing more slowly.<br>
      <br>
      “It's about reprogramming the body so it enters a slower aging
      mode, but also rejuvenating it through stem cell-based
      regeneration,' Professor Longo added.<br>
      <br>
      “It's not a typical diet because it isn't something you need to
      stay on.”<br>
      <br>
      • Statins save fewer lives than exercising and eating sensibly,
      say scientists<br>
      • Eat within 12-hour window to lose weight, say scientists<br>
      • No link found between saturated fat and heart disease<br>
      <br>
      Previous research has shown that cutting calories not only
      prevents weight gain but also prolongs good health and longevity.<br>
      <br>
      However British health experts said that people may find it easier
      to just alter daily calorie intake rather than embarking on the
      intense five-day diet.<br>
      <br>
      Naveed Sattar, professor of Metabolic Medicine at the University
      of Glasgow said: “The best way to alter weight trajectory or to
      lose weight is to make permanent and sustainable changes in ones
      dietary composition so that less high density calories like cakes,
      biscuits, crisps.<br>
      <br>
      “This way, folk can eat three meals a day and still have total
      less calorie intake than they had previously. This, for me, is
      better for mind and body, and critically, more sustainable.” <br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;Prof Lynne Cox, Associate Professor of Biochemistry,
      University of Oxford, said the results look promising.<br>
      <br>
      “ For many years, caloric restriction (cutting out 30-40% of your
      calories each and every day) has looked the best bet for improving
      health outcomes during ageing, but this new diet appears much
      easier to stick to than caloric restriction – in humans, it
      involves taking low protein plant-based meal replacements that
      provided a third to a half of normal calorie intake for five days
      every month over a cycle of three months," she said.<br>
      <br>
      "What is noteworthy here is that the study incorporates a whole
      host of experiments from model organisms as simple as yeast cells,
      through mice and into a small controlled clinical trial in humans.
      All of the results point in one direction: periodically mimicking
      fasting leads to marked decreases in risk factors for diseases
      such as diabetes and heart disease, and, in mice, improved short
      and long term memory were observed.<br>
      <br>
      "Yes, it needs more tests and in some cases different ways of
      measuring outcomes. But the trends look interesting. If over a
      longer time human findings match up to the results in mice then
      this type of intervention has the potential to improve health –
      though it is likely to be more relevant to young and middle-aged
      people as drastic metabolic changes may not be well-tolerated in
      older people.”<br>
      <br>
      Professor Longo believes that for most normal people, the FMD can
      be done every three to six months, depending on the abdominal
      circumference and health status.<br>
      <br>
      For obese subjects or those with elevated disease risk factors,
      the FMD could be recommended by the physician as often as once
      every two weeks.<br>
      <br>
      His group is testing its effect in a randomized clinical trial,
      which will be completed soon, with more than 70 subjects.<br>
      <br>
      'If the results remain as positive as the current ones, I believe
      this FMD will represent the first safe and effective intervention
      to promote positive changes associated with longevity and health
      span, which can be recommended by a physician,' Longo said.<br>
      <br>
      Despite its positive effects, Longo cautioned against water-only
      fasting and warned even about attempting the fasting mimicking
      diet without first consulting a doctor and seeking their
      supervision throughout the process.<br>
      <br>
      'Not everyone is healthy enough to fast for five days, and the
      health consequences can be severe for a few who do it improperly,'
      he said. 'Water-only fasting should only be done in a specialized
      clinic and can increase the incidence of gallstones in women at
      risk if done improperly.”<br>
      <br>
      The study was published in the journal Cell Metabolism funded by
      the National Institute on Aging. <br>

        <b><br>
        </b><b>by</b><b><br>
        </b><b><br>
        </b><b>Arnie Lerma</b><br>
      </div>
      <b><br>
      </b>I describe this as secret because this is not described except
      by an old hypnotist named LeCron, in his book Clinical Hypnosis. I
      no longer have this particular book available to quote so the
      following insight is my own wording based on the lightning bolt of
      insight that struck me after learning this.<br>
      <br>
      Described under a subheading that stated “An advanced method for
      creating the deepest states of hypnosis” What was described was
      the following as a fact of hypnosis:<br>
      <br>
      “To create the deepest trance states, all one has to do is cause
      the person to imagine something that is moving that is not really
      there” and then do this “repetitively a few times”<br>
      <br>
      I will give you an example, if you are comfortable with trance
      imagine along with me: ( I won’t be asking for you money )<br>
      <br>
      “Imagine a bright yellow tennis ball rolling across the desk in
      front of you, towards the doorway, and then it falls off the edge,
      bouncing a few times and continues silently through the door, out
      of sight. Imagine it coming to stop in the next room and being
      motionless on the floor.”<br>
      <br>
      Do this a few times, you may find yourself in a state similar to a
      daydream. Note that in this state your awareness of you own
      physical pains and body sensations are reduced, you do not feel
      them as much as you did before. Each time you repeat this exercise
      of your imagination you feel less and less sensation in your
      body….<br>
      <br>
      I’ll wait for you to finish repeating the above a half dozen
      times…<br>
      <br>
      For those who have experienced Hubbard’s covert hypnotic scam, you
      will immediately recognize that this METHOD is analogous to the
      shore stories told to us in both Dianetics and Scientology,
      especially the upper secret levels.<br>
      <br>
      LeCron described that if a person had objections or felt
      apprehensive about hypnosis that you need not tell the person that
      you are trying to hypnotize them, you can, instead “tell them a
      story” to give them “an excuse” to imagine something that is
      moving that is not really there.<br>
      <br>
      Also because the apparency of motion is relative it does not
      matter if the object being imagined is moving – now, pay attention
      to this, this is important, – or if the person is moving through
      the scene. It also matters not if the person is moving physically
      through the scene or is moving through time!!<br>
      <br>
      What is achieved are some of the deepest states of hypnosis. The
      deeper the state, the more suggestible the subject becomes, the
      more relaxed and willing to take what is stated just after this
      state is created as true!<br>
      <br>
      One can reduce the literal acceptance of suggestions received
      while in this state by noting all the times in your past when you
      were tricked this way. Science Fiction does this often, but for
      entertainment, the reduction of pain and unwanted physical
      sensations associated with hypnosis makes fiction stories that
      include action more pleasurable to read. However, if this method
      is used by a master manipulator it becomes dangerous.<br>
      <br>
      I will end this short page now as this material deserves a few
      days of contemplation to receive the most benefit from the
      understanding you have just gained.<br>
      <br>
      Thank you for reading, I hope this helps some of you recover from
      ANY past covert hypnotic abuse.<br>

      </b>How To Make Everything aims to explore everyday things many of
      us take for granted. Andy George, host of the show, attempts to
      craft items entirely by hand, but first he must gather the raw
      ingredients as they would be found in nature. How To Make
      Everything isn’t so much of a “how-to” show as it is a way of
      understanding the world. In each episode, Andy takes on a new
      product, learning the history and evolution of the things we use

        <br>
        <big><i>It would be humorous if people weren't dying because
            of&nbsp;it</i></big><br>
        <br>

        <b>Dmitry Orlov</b><br>
      </div>
      <b><br>
      </b>I couldn't help but notice that over the past few weeks the
      Empire has become extremely silly—so silly that I believe it
      deserves the title of the World's Silliest Empire. One could claim
      that it has been silly before, but recent developments seem to
      signal a quantum leap in its silliness&nbsp;level.<br>
      <br>
      The first bit of extreme silliness surfaced when Gen. Lloyd J.
      Austin III, the head of the United States Central Command, told a
      Senate panel that only a very small number of Syrian fighters
      trained by the United States remained in the fight—perhaps as few
      as&nbsp;five.<br>
      <br>
      The tab for training and equipping them was $500 million. That's
      $100 million per fighter, but that's OK, because it's all good as
      long as the military contractors are getting paid. Things got even
      sillier when it later turned out that even these few fighters got
      car-jacked by ISIS/al Qaeda in Syria (whatever they are currently
      calling themselves) and got their vehicles and weapons taken away
      from&nbsp;them.<br>
      <br>
      General Austin's previous role as as Lt. General Casey in Tim
      Burton's film&nbsp;Mars Attacks!&nbsp;It was already a very silly
      role, but his current role is a definite career advancement, both
      in terms of rank and in terms of silliness&nbsp;level.<br>
      <br>
      The next silly moment arrived at the UN General Assembly meeting
      in New York, where Obama, who went on for 30 minutes instead of
      the allotted 15 (does Mr. Silly President know how to read a
      clock?) managed to use up all of this time and say absolutely
      nothing that made any sense to&nbsp;anyone.<br>
      <br>
      But it was Putin's speech that laid out the Empire's silliness for
      all to see when he scolded the US for making a bloody mess of the
      Middle East with its ham-handed interventions. The oft-repeated
      quote is “Do you understand what you have done?” but that's not
      quite&nbsp;right.<br>
      <br>
      The Russian «Вы хоть понимаете теперь, чего вы натворили?» can be
      more accurately translated as “How can you even now fail to
      understand what a mess you have&nbsp;made?”<br>
      Words matter: this is not how one talks to a superpower before an
      assembly of the world's leaders; this is how one scolds a stupid
      and wayward child. In the eyes of the whole world, this made the
      Empire look rather&nbsp;silly.<br>
      <br>
      What happened next is that Russia announced the start of its
      bombing campaign against all manner of terrorists in Syria (and
      perhaps Iraq too; the Iraqi request is in Putin's&nbsp;in-box).<br>
      What's notable about this bombing campaign is that it is entirely
      legal. The legitimate, elected government of Syria asked Russia
      for help; the campaign was approved by the
      Russian&nbsp;legislature.<br>
      On the other hand, the bombing campaign that the US has been
      conducting in Syria is entirely illegal. There are exactly two
      ways to legally bomb the territory of another country: 1. an
      invitation from that country's government and 2. a UN Security
      Council resolution. The US has not obtained either of&nbsp;them.<br>
      <br>
      Why is this important? Because the UN, with its Security Council,
      was instituted to prevent war, by making it difficult for nations
      to engage each other militarily without all sorts of international
      economic and political repercussions. After World War II it was
      thought that wars are rather nasty and that something should be
      done to prevent&nbsp;them. <br>
      <br>
      But the US feels that this is rather unnecessary.&nbsp;When a
      Russian correspondent (Gayane Chichakyan from RT) asked the White
      House press secretary under what legal authority the US was
      bombing Syria, he at first pretended to not understand the
      question, then babbled incoherently, looking rather&nbsp;silly. <br>
      <br>
      You see, the US likes to fight wars (or rather, its military
      contractors like to fight wars, because that's how they make
      money, and they happen to own a big piece of the US government).
      But the US can't win any wars, and that makes its entire war
      effort rather silly (in a murderous sort of&nbsp;way).<br>
      <br>
      In spite of American recalcitrance, the UN does in fact prevent
      wars. Recently it prevented the US from mounting a “limited strike
      against the Assad regime in response to the brazen use of chemical
      weapons” (or so said Obama during his UN speech).&nbsp;This was
      helped by a deft bit of Russian diplomacy, in the course of which
      Syria voluntarily gave up its chemical weapons stockpiles.
      Undeterred by diplomacy, the US squeezed off a couple of cruise
      missiles in the general direction of Syria, but the Russians
      promptly shot them out of the sky, triggering a major rethink at
      the Pentagon and, of course, making the US look rather&nbsp;silly.<br>
      <br>
      But once you make a fool of yourself, why stop? Indeed, Obama
      shows no intention of stopping. Just about the entire audience at
      the UN General Assembly knew that the Syrian government's chemical
      attack on its own people never happened. The chemicals were
      provided by the Saudis and were unwittingly used by the Syrian
      rebels on themselves. Lying, when everybody knows that you are
      lying, and knows that you know that you are lying: what could
      possibly be&nbsp;sillier?<br>
      <br>
      Ok, how about continuously prattling on about “freedom and
      democracy”—in the Middle East, after throwing the whole region
      into chaos through their brain-dead interventions? The only voice
      of reason in the US seems to be that of Donald Trump, who recently
      declared that the Middle East was more stable under Saddam
      Hussein, Moammar Khaddafi and Bashar al Assad. Indeed it was. The
      fact that the only non-silly politician left in the US is
      Trump—that bloviating moneybag—sets a rather high bar for
      silliness for the country as a&nbsp;whole.<br>
      <br>
      Prattling on about “freedom and democracy” in the Middle East is
      also silly because the entire region is tribal—has been tribal for
      a few thousand years, and will be tribal for a few thousand more.
      In each locale, some tribe is on top. If the idea is to carve it
      up into sovereign territorial units (none of which qualifies as a
      nation, because each one ends up being multinational) then each
      territorial unit ends up being ruled by some tribe while others
      grumble. Blunder in and exploit their grumbling to bring about
      “regime change”—and the whole place invariably burns&nbsp;down.<br>
      <br>
      A case in point is Israel: it's got the top dog tribe—the Jews,
      and they can shoot or bomb anybody else with impunity. It is
      considered “democratic” because the Jews get to vote, which is
      very nice for the Jews. The Alawites in Syria get to vote too—and
      vote for Bashar al Assad—so why isn't that good enough? Because of
      American hypocrisy and double&nbsp;standards.<br>
      <br>
      It's like that right down the line. Saudi Arabia is owned by one
      tribe—the House of Saud, and everybody else is disenfranchised.
      Iraq used to be run by the Sunnis from Saddam Hussein's tribe, but
      the Americans dislodged them, and now what remains of it is ruled
      by the Shia from the south of the country while the Sunnis ran off
      and joined ISIS. This can all seem like super-simple stuff, but
      not for the Americans, because it runs counter to their ideology,
      which dictates that the world must be remade in America's image.
      And so they keep trying to do this (or keep pretending to be
      trying, because results don't matter as long as their military
      contractors get paid) and don't seem to care one bit that this is
      making them look very&nbsp;silly.<br>
      <br>
      And so the typical pattern has been this: the US bombs a country
      to smithereens, mounts a ground invasion, sets up a puppet regime
      and, promptly or not so promptly, pulls out. The puppet regime
      falls apart, and then you have either ungovernable chaos or some
      new, especially nasty form of dictatorship, or a little of each: a
      failed state, like Libya, and Yemen, and much of Afghanistan, Iraq
      and Syria. It doesn't much matter that this is the result (as long
      as the military contractors are getting paid) because America's
      motto seems to be “Look Silly and Carry On.” Wreck a country—and
      it's on to the next bombing&nbsp;campaign.<br>
      <br>
      But this is where it all gets meta-silly: in Syria they can't even
      achieve that. The Americans have been bombing ISIS for a year now;
      meanwhile, ISIS has gotten stronger and occupied more territory.
      But they haven't gotten around to overthrowing Assad; instead, the
      ISIS boys have been busy prancing around the desert in black head
      rags and white basketball shoes taking selfies, blowing up
      archaeological sites, enslaving women and beheading anyone they
      don't&nbsp;like.<br>
      <br>
      But now it appears that the Russians have achieved in five days of
      bombing what the Americans couldn't in a year and the ISIS boys
      are running away to Jordan; others want to go to Germany and ask
      for asylum. This has made the Americans upset, because, you see,
      the Russians were bombing “their” terrorists—the ones the
      Americans recruited, armed and trained… and then bombed? I know,
      silly—but true. The Russians will have none of that, because their
      approach is, if it looks like a terrorist and quacks like a
      terrorist, then it is a terrorist, so let's bomb&nbsp;it.<br>
      But it is understandable that this approach is unpopular with the
      Americans: here they were carefully pumping the place full of
      weapons and equipment, and bombing carefully around the edges so
      as not to blow up any of it, and the Russians just blunder in and
      blow it all up! The Saudis are absolutely livid, because it was
      they who paid for much of it. Plus the terrorists are their own
      Wahhabi-Takfiri brethren—the ones who like to declare various
      other Muslims that they don't happen to like to be infidels, in
      direct violation of their own Sharia law. Does that remind you of
      anyone? Anyone&nbsp;silly?<br>
      <br>
      But it doesn't appear that the US can do anything to stop the
      Russians, or the Chinese who also want to get a piece of ISIS to
      stuff and mount, or the Iranians and the Hezbollah fighters who
      are ready to march in and mop up what remains of ISIS once the
      bombing missions destroy all the war materiel it has amassed. And
      so it's time for Americans to start an information war by accusing
      the Russians of causing civilian&nbsp;casualties.<br>
      <br>
      Of course, being Americans, they have to prosecute this
      information war in the silliest way possible. First, you trot out
      your claims of civilian casualties before the Russians fly a
      single sortie. Oops! Then you stuff the social media with fake
      pictures of wounded children produced beforehand by performers in
      white helmets paid for by George Soros. And then, when asked for
      evidence, you refuse to provide&nbsp;any.<br>
      <br>
      So far so good, but let's get even sillier. Immediately after
      screaming loudly about Russians causing civilian casualties, the
      Americans blow up a hospital in Afghanistan that was run by
      Medecins sans Frontières, in spite of being informed of its
      location both before and during the bombing. “Don't kill
      civilians… like this!” Could it get any sillier than that? Of
      course it can: the US can start blatantly, nakedly lying about the
      event: “There were Taleban fighters hiding in that hospital!”—no,
      there weren't; “The Afghans told us to bomb that hospital!”—no,
      they didn't. Bombing that hospital was an actual war crime—so says
      the UN. Are are the Russians now going to listen to criticism from
      war criminals? Don't be&nbsp;silly!<br>
      <br>
      It's really hard to tell, but anything seems possible now. For
      example, the US no longer seems to have a foreign policy: the
      White House says one thing, the State Department another, the
      Pentagon a third, Samantha Power at the UN pursues a foreign
      policy of her own using Twitter, and Senator John McCain wants to
      arm Syrian rebels to shoot down Russian planes. (All five of them?
      John, don't be silly!) In response to all this confusion,
      America's political puppets in the European Union are starting to
      twitch uncontrollably and go off-script, because the nerve center
      in Washington is no longer sending them clear&nbsp;signals.<br>
      <br>
      How is this all going to end? Well, since we are all just being
      silly, let me make a humble suggestion: the US should bomb
      everything inside the Beltway in Washington, plus a few counties
      in Virginia. That should significantly degrade the country's
      capability for being extremely silly. And if that doesn't work—so
      what? After all, it is clear that results don't matter. As long as
      the military contractors are getting paid, it's all&nbsp;good.<br>

      Abstract:&nbsp; An optical rectenna – that is, a device that
      directly converts free-propagating electromagnetic waves at
      optical frequencies to d.c. electricity – was first proposed over
      40 years ago, yet this concept has not been demonstrated
      experimentally due to fabrication challenges at the nanoscale.
      Realizing an optical rectenna requires that an antenna be coupled
      to a diode that operates on the order of 1 petahertz (switching
      speed on the order of a femtosecond). Ultralow capacitance, on the
      order of a few attofarads, enables a diode to operate at these
      frequencies; and the development of metal-insulator-metal tunnel
      junctions with nanoscale dimensions has emerged as a potential
      path to diodes with ultralow capacitance, but these structures
      remain extremely difficult to fabricate and couple to a nanoscale
      antenna reliably. Here we demonstrate an optical rectenna by
      engineering metal-insulator-metal tunnel diodes, with ultralow
      junction capacitance of approximately 2 attofarads, at the tips of
      multiwall carbon nanotubes, which act as the antenna and metallic
      electron field emitter in the diode. This demonstration is
      achieved using very small diode areas based on the diameter of a
      single carbon nanotube (about 10 nanometers), geometric field
      enhancement at the carbon nanotube tips, and a low work function
      semi-transparent top metal contact. Using vertically-aligned
      arrays of the diodes, we measure d.c. open-circuit voltage and
      short-circuit current at visible and infrared electromagnetic
      frequencies that is due to a rectification process, and quantify
      minor contributions from thermal effects. In contrast to recent
      reports of photodetection based on hot electron decay in plasmonic
      nanoscale antenna, a coherent optical antenna field is rectified
      directly in our devices, consistent with rectenna theory. Our
      devices show evidence of photon-assisted tunneling that reduces
      diode resistance by two orders of magnitude under monochromatic
      illumination. Additionally, power rectification is observed under
      simulated solar illumination. Numerous current-voltage scans on
      different devices, and between 5-77 degrees Celsius, show no
      detectable change in diode performance, indicating a potential for
      robust operation. <br>

      Inventor(s): Patrick STENFALT, et al. <br>
      <br>
      An airflow driven electrical generator incorporating a funnelled
      or coned particle collector (A) to augment turbulent airflow,
      convert it to laminar airflow (b) and direct it through a series
      of nozzles (E) to between a series of rotational shaft mounted
      disks of a Tesla turbine (I). The turbine is used to drive a high
      speed generator formed from a radial Halbach array of magnets (M).
      There may also be an air compressor (S) to provide a source of
      airflow when there is no wind and the inner surface of the
      particle collector may be volute shaped like a Fibonacci spiral.
      The rotor may also be mounted on magnetic bearings (G).<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND</b><br>
      <br>
      This invention relates to a device for the collection of turbulent
      airflow, converting it to laminar airflow, augmenting the pressure
      of the said airflow and using the said augmented airflow as the
      motive power to drive an electrical generator.<br>
      <br>
      Once airflow ceases, air driven electrical generators such as wind
      turbines rapidly cease to rotate thus stopping the generation of
      electrical charge.<br>
      <br>
      At present, conventional wind driven turbine devices rely upon
      aerodynamically shaped blades caused to be rotated by relatively
      high wind speeds. To achieve the optimum wind speed necessitates
      the devices utilizing large surface area blades being situated on
      the top of tall static pylons.<br>
      <br>
      These wind driven turbines are notoriously inefficient in that
      they are only able to utilize a fraction of the volume of air
      required for them to rotate.<br>
      <br>
      Wind turbines also are susceptible to natural phenomena such as
      turbulence, gusting, and sudden changes in wind direction. When
      air flows at higher velocities, especially over the earth's
      irregular surface, flow is generally disorganized, even chaotic,
      and tends to form eddies. This is called turbulent flow. A
      relatively large driving pressure is required to sustain turbulent
      flow. Driving pressure during turbulent flow is in fact
      proportional to the square of the flow rate such that to double
      the flow rate it is necessary to quadruple the driving pressure.<br>
      <br>
      When air flows through a smooth bore, it tends to be more orderly
      and streamlined and to flow in a straight line. This type of flow
      is called laminar flow. Unlike turbulent flow, laminar flow is
      directly proportional to the driving pressure, such that to double
      the flow rate, it is only necessary to double the driving
      pressure.<br>
      <br>
      The objections to the present wind turbine devices are; 1. They
      are noisy 2. They are unsightly 3. Tbeyare static.<br>
      <br>
      4. They only produce charge when a suitable a suitable airflow is
      present.<br>
      <br>
      5. They are only suitable in supplying the grid when accumulated
      in large farms', often offshore.<br>
      <br>
      6. They require large blades and pylons which are expensive to
      construct install and maintain.<br>
      <br>
      7. They need blades to be high up to take advantage of high wind
      speeds and reduced turbulence.<br>
      <br>
      8. They are susceptible to natural phenomena such as turbulence,
      gusting, sudden changes in wind direction, lightning strikes.<br>
      <br>
      9. They only utilize a small amount of the air required to cause
      rotation.<br>
      <br>
      Moving vehicles create a drag pressure which can be utilized to
      produce electrical charge. At present there are no successful
      turbines or induction devices that rely upon drag created by
      vehicles moving through air particles to create charge.<br>
      <br>
      <b>STATEMENT OF INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      To overcome these problems I have developed, from proven
      technology, an Air Driven Electrical Generator (ADEG) that can
      continue to produce electrical charge after any wind/drag force
      has been removed.<br>
      <br>
      The invention proposes a device that is relatively small and can
      be mounted either on a static structure or moving vehicle and
      comprises:- -A form of air collector that allows moving air
      particles (in the form of wind, or drag from a moving vehicle) to
      be collected and converted from turbulent flow into laminar flow
      and at the same time augmenting airflow pressure.<br>
      <br>
      -An electrical generator driven by the motive power of the said
      airflow -A safety device incorporating sensors and solenoid valves
      that detect when the generator has reached a predetermined output
      and causes a solenoid valve to be closed to prevent any overrun,
      and also causes that solenoid valve to be reopened when the sensor
      detects the output from the generator has fallen to a
      predetermined level.<br>
      <br>
      The Air Collector is an inventive step and comprises a fornils of
      cone/s (funnel/s) that permits turbulent air to enter. As air
      particles are forced through the funnel the said air particles are
      gradually converted from turbulent flow to laminar flow. The
      particles then exit the cone/funnel and nozzle at an augmented
      pressure and pass through the solenoid valve into the generator.<br>
      <br>
      The generator comprises a shaft rotating between magnetic
      bearings. The magnetic bearings are mounted on bulkheads in such a
      way that the fixed, or non-rotating, part of the bearing is
      prevented from moving.<br>
      <br>
      The shaft is located into the rotating part of the magnetic
      bearing forming the rotor.<br>
      <br>
      The magnetic bearings cause the rotor to float' within the stator.
      In other words there is an air gap between the rotor and stator
      parts of the bearing and thus minimal friction force is generated
      as the shaft rotates. This allows the rotor to rotate at very high
      speeds.<br>
      <br>
      Mounted and fixed at one end of the shaft, is a series of disks
      located in close proximity to each other. Laminar air flow passes
      at pressure between the faces of the disks. The laminar fluid
      airflow passing between the faces of the disks causes lateral
      resistance (drag friction) on the disks resulting in rotation of
      the shaft.<br>
      <br>
      Mounted and fixed at one end of the shaft is a permanent magnet
      assembly, which rotates as the shaft rotates.<br>
      <br>
      Mounted on a bulkhead, in close proximity to the permanent
      magnets, are a series of wire wound coils, one for each magnet. As
      the magnets pass across the face of the coils then the magnetic
      fields of the magnets cause a charge to be generated in the coils.<br>
      <br>
      Depending on the arrangement of magnets and coils, the charge
      produced maybe alternating current, direct current, and single or
      3 phase.<br>
      <br>
      The amount of charged produced by the generator will depend upon a
      number of factors, including<br>
      <br>
      -Strength of magnetic field<br>
      <br>
      -Speed of rotation of the magnets -Number of turns of coil wire
      -Gauge of wire.<br>
      <br>
      The SAFETY DEVICE comprises sensors incorporated into solenoid
      valves to detect when the output charge of the generator reaches a
      predetermined value. At that point the valve, or other shut off
      mechanism, would be activated to prevent any more air entering the
      generator.<br>
      <br>
      When the output charge of the generator drops to another
      predetermined value, the sensor would activate the opening of the
      valve or other opening mechanism.<br>
      <br>
      The uniqueness of this device is that apart from being more
      efficient than other wind driven devices, the magnetic bearings
      allow the rotor to rotate at very high speeds and continue to
      rotate for a considerable time even after wind or drag has been
      shut off from the device, due to the very low resistance of the
      magnetic bearings Also incorporated into the device, in the event
      of an absence of wind or drag force for a considerable length of
      time, is an air compressor the product of which performs a similar
      function to generated laminar air flow.<br>
      <br>
      <b>ADVANTAGES</b><br>
      <br>
      The advantages of the invention are; 1. the invention, being
      relatively small, can be sound insulated to ensure quietness of
      operation 2. the invention, being relatively small, can be
      situated in unobtrusive positions 3. the invention will be
      suitable for static and mobile platforms 4. the invention will be
      suitable for supplying the national grid when a number of units
      are grouped together and mounted on offshore/onshore platforms 5.
      the invention can be positioned wherever any type of airflow can
      be captured 6. the invention will not require large blades or
      pylons and is therefore less expensive to install and maintain 7.
      the invention will have no need to be mounted high up 8. the
      invention will not be susceptible to turbulence, gusting or
      changes in wind direction 9. the invention will utilize the
      majority of airflow required for rotation 10. the invention,
      fitted with magnetic bearings, will allow rotation at very high
      speeds and thus produce large amounts of charge, and also allow
      rotation to continue after airflow has ceased The invention, when
      fitted with a multi directional array of air particle collector/s,
      can take advantage of the lower wind speeds found at the low
      altitude levels of most buildings to produce usable charge. This
      would enable users to offset costs of energy bills. The internal
      surfaces of the air particle collectors may be formed into
      Fibonacci spirals to improve efficiency of particles through the
      collector.<br>
      <br>
      A group of devices, when fitted with a multi directional array of
      air particle collectors, could be mounted on offshore or onshore
      platforms to take advantage of winds at sea and land so contribute
      to the national grid.<br>
      <br>
      The invention, when fitted with a fixed directional air particle
      collector, can be used on a moving vehicle to take advantage of
      the drag pressure caused by the said vehicle moving through air
      particles. This should have major repercussions within the
      automobile industry in its search for efficient electric motor
      driven vehicles since it will reduce the reliance on expensive
      battery arrays.<br>
      <br>

      generator, compressor and air collector is shown in the

      <b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</b><br>
      <br>
      Turbulent air flow particles enter the Air Collector at point (A)
      and move through the Collector to point (B) where they exit into
      delivery tube (C). As the air particles move from point (A) to
      point (B) they become less turbulent until at point (B) the air
      flow becomes virtually laminar.<br>
      <br>
      If pressure x volume at point (A) is P1V1 and pressure x volume at
      point (B) is P2V2 then according to Boyle's Law P1V1=P2V2. Thus,
      as the volume of air particles decreases during passage from point
      (A) to point (B) then pressure increases. The increase in pressure
      is dependent upon the dimensions of the Air Collector at points
      (A) and (B).<br>
      <br>
      Laminar flow air particles pass along delivery tube (C), through
      solenoid valve (D), and exit through nozzles (E) into the
      Generator Housing A rotatable shaft (F) made of non-magnetic
      material, has mounted two or more magnetic bearings (G). The
      bearings (G) can be active magnetic (AMB), passive magnetic (PMB)
      active/passive magnetic (APMB), homopolar electrodynamic (HEDB),
      or a combination of any of the aforementioned. The inner part of
      the bearing allows the shaft (F) to rotate whilst the outer part
      of the bearing is mounted on bearing plate (H). A form of Tesla
      Turbine comprising non-magnetic disks (I) and non-magnetic spacers
      (J) is mounted on shaft (F). A second bearing plate, with or
      without a mounted bearing (K) isolates the turbine whilst
      continuing to allowing the shaft to rotate. Located in the bearing
      plate (K) are a series of ventilation holes (U) adjacent to the
      coils. These allow used airflow to leave to leave the disk turbine
      chamber and air-cool the coils (0).<br>
      <br>
      In the configuration described in the Drawings, a magnet plate/s
      (L) is mounted on the shaft.<br>
      <br>
      Affixed to the said magnet plate/s is a plurality of magnets (M)
      in the form of a radial Halbach Array. The said magnet plate/s (L)
      is allowed to rotate within a coil plate/s (N) to which is affixed
      a plurality of coils (G), one coil for each segment of the radial
      Halbach Array.<br>
      <br>
      Since the shaft (F) would be capable of rotating at high speed the
      radial Halbach Array being mounted on the said shaft minimizes the
      effect on the magnets of centrifugal force. The rotation of the
      magnets in the vicinity of the coils causes a charge to be
      generated.<br>
      <br>
      In other configurations magnets may be located in many ways. The
      magnets may be on an end plate of the rotor (on a pitch circle
      diameter, pcd). They may be on the inner diameter of a cylinder
      (stator design or external rotor). They can be built within the
      stator or rotor sections. The magnets may be designed to be
      stationary or form part of the moving sections.<br>
      <br>
      The placement, style, shape and design of the coils may also vary.<br>
      <br>
      End plates (T), upper base plate (I), and lower base plate (P)
      give rigidity to the unit as well as offering protection. A vent
      (Q) in the end plate (T) allows airflow to exit the turbine
      section of the unit.<br>
      <br>
      On a static platform, airflow (wind) enters via a multidirectional
      air capture cone. On a mobile platform airflow (drag) enters via
      the single directional air capture cone. When the free air
      solenoid valve (D) is open, airflow continues through the airlines
      (C) and enters the turbine chamber via nozzles (E). The augmented
      pressure airflow passes between the disks (I) in the turbine
      section of the unit. When airflow comes into contact with the
      disks (I) it is taken hold of by the latter and subjected to two
      forces, one acting tangentially in the direction of rotation, and
      the other radially outward. The combined effect of these
      tangential and centrifugal forces is to force the shaft (F) to
      rotate, and to propel the airflow in a spiral path until the
      airflow reaches a suitable peripheral outlet (Q)/(U) from which it
      is ejected.<br>
      <br>
      Since the shaft (F) is mounted on magnetic bearings (G), which by
      their very nature are tow friction, a minimum of airflow force is
      required to rotate the said shaft. Laws of Motion dictate that if,
      whilst the shaft is rotating, force continues to be applied then
      the rate of rotation of the shaft will increase until forces are
      balanced, at which point the shaft will rotate at a constant
      speed. If the airflow force is removed then the rate of rotation
      of the shaft will decrease, however since the bearings are of low
      friction, rotation decreases at a considerably slower rate than if
      conventional roller or ball bearings were used.<br>
      <br>
      As shaft (F) rotates so magnet plate (L) rotates at the same rate
      causing the magnetic field generated by magnets (M) to pass across
      the windings of coils (0) thus generating a charge.<br>
      <br>
      As speed of rotation of the said shaft increases so charge
      generated increases. A sensor incorporated into free air solenoid
      valve (D) detects when the maximum permitted output charge has
      been reached and causes the said solenoid valve (D) to shut, thus
      permitting no further airflow to enter the unit. As the rate of
      rotation of the shaft decreases so generated charge decreases. The
      said sensor incorporated into the free air solenoid (D) detects
      the drop in charge and at a predetermined level opens the said
      solenoid valve (D) permitting airflow to enter the system and
      increase the rate of rotation of the shaft thus maintaining
      generated output charge.<br>
      <br>
      If there has not been airflow entering the system, and rotation of
      the shaft has ceased, then solenoid valve (R) may be opened
      manually or remotely, permitting air from compressor (5) to enter
      the system and allow electrical charge to be generated as
      described above. Opening of solenoid valve (R) will cause solenoid
      valve (D) to close thus preventing compressed air from being
      exhausted through the Collector. Once the permitted output charge
      has been reached then a sensor incorporated into solenoid valve
      (R) causes the valve to shut and solenoid valve (D) to open. Any
      charge surplus to use is used to power the compressor and recharge
      the compressed air tanks.<br>
      <br>
      <b>APPLICATION</b><br>
      <br>
      1. A small ADEG device could be located in an electric vehicle
      where the drag produced by the forward movement of the vehicle
      would be more than capable of charging the vehicle's batteries, or
      even powering the electric motoii This would reduce the reliance
      of electric vehicles on expensive batteries, and drastically
      increase the range of the vehicle.<br>
      <br>
      2. A device with a form of air collector mounted on a (sic)
      domestic chimney, with the ADEG inside the building protected from
      the elements, could provide sufficient charge for the needs of an
      average house with the excess sold back to the National Grid.<br>
      <br>
      3. Larger devices generating 3 phase would be capable of powering
      small workshops and factories.<br>
      <br>
      4. Banks of larger devices offshore or onshore could supply the
      National Grid.<br>

      super-drug being harvested by Illuminati from terrified
      child-sacrifice victims -- read the dubious Stewart Swerdlow,
      e.g., for a typical "authoritative" espousal of this notion...<br>

      Adrenochrome (catecholamine o-quinone),[1] chemical formula
      C9H9NO3, is a compound produced by the oxidation of adrenaline
      (epinephrine). The derivative carbazochrome is a hemostatic
      medication. It is unrelated to chrome (chromium).<br>
      <br>
      <b>Chemistry</b><br>
      <br>
      In vivo, adrenochrome is synthesized by the oxidation of
      epinephrine. In vitro, silver oxide (Ag2O) is used as an oxidizing
      agent.[2] Its presence is detected in solution by a pink color.
      The color turns brown upon polymerization.<br>
      Effect on the brain<br>
      <br>
      Several small-scale studies (involving 15 or fewer test subjects)
      were done in the 50s and 60s, reporting that adrenochrome
      triggered psychotic reactions like thought disorder,
      derealization, and euphoria.[3] It has never been scientifically
      accepted, however, that adrenochrome has psychedelic
      properties.[4] Researchers Abram Hoffer and Humphry Osmond claimed
      that adrenochrome is a neurotoxic, psychotomimetic substance and
      may play a role in schizophrenia and other mental illnesses.[5] In
      what they called the "adrenochrome hypothesis",[6] they speculated
      that megadoses of vitamin C and niacin could cure schizophrenia by
      reducing brain adrenochrome.[7][8]<br>
      Law<br>
      <br>
      Adrenochrome is unscheduled by the Controlled Substances Act in
      the United States, but if sold as a supplement, sales must conform
      to U.S. supplement laws. If sold for consumption as a food or
      drug, sales are regulated by the FDA.[9][unreliable source?]<br>
      In popular culture<br>
      <br>
      Adrenochrome is mentioned in The Doors of Perception by Aldous
      Huxley as "a product of the decomposition of adrenaline" that can
      "produce many of the symptoms observed in mescaline intoxication."<br>
      Author Hunter S. Thompson mentions adrenochrome in his book Fear
      and Loathing in Las Vegas. The adrenochrome scene also appears in
      the novel's film adaptation. In the DVD commentary, director Terry
      Gilliam admits that his and Thompson's portrayal is a fictional
      exaggeration. In fact, Gilliam insists that the drug is entirely
      fictional and seems unaware of the existence of a substance with
      even a similar name. Thompson also mentions the substance in his
      book Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail '72.<br>
      The harvesting of an adrenal gland from a live victim to obtain
      Adrenochrome for drug abuse is a plot feature in the episode "Whom
      the Gods would Destroy" of the British TV series Lewis (2008).[10]<br>
      Appetite for Adrenochrome is the title of the debut album by
      Sacramento, California pop-punk band the Groovie Ghoulies.<br>
      Adrenochrome is a song recorded in 1982 by The Sisters of Mercy,
      released on the Body Electric single and compilations including
      Some Girls Wander by Mistake.<br>
      In Anthony Burgess's novel A Clockwork Orange, one of the
      available additives to the "milk-plus" served at the Korova Milk
      Bar (actually rendered as "Milkbar" in the book) is "drencrom,"
      which is likely a reference to Adrenochrome.[11] [Note that the
      characters in the novel and in A Clockwork Orange (film) consume
      different types of milk-plus. In the novel they drink, "...milk
      with knives in it, as we used to say, and this would sharpen you
      up and make you ready for a bit of dirty twenty-to-one...." In the
      film, however, the opening narration explains that "The Korova
      Milkbar sold milk-plus: Milk plus vellocet, or synthemesc, or
      drencrom, which is what we were drinking. This would sharpen you
      up and make you ready for a bit of the old ultraviolence.<br>
      Also mentioned in the Autobiography of a Werewolf Hunter trilogy
      of novels where the adrenal glands are harvested for the creation
      of adrenochrome to use as a drug.<br>

      Compound used: D,L-Adrenochrome freebase (synthetic, 99,98%

      2,3-Dihydro-3-hydroxy-1-methyl-1H-indole-5,6-dione<br>
      <br>
      Note: D,L means it is a racemate, which means it is an equimolar
      mixture of two of enantiomers: the D-Adrenochrome and the
      L-Adrenochrome (also called (-)-Adrenochrome et (+)-Adrenochrome
      respectively)<br>
      <br>
      Adrenochrome has been described as a hallucinogen or
      psychotomimetic and a cholinesterase inhibitor. It has also
      haemostatic properties (meaning that it is something that stops
      bleeding.<br>
      <br>
      Description of the powder: a close-up of the adrenochrome crystals
      shows a dark red color but the powder seems just like dried blood
      to the naked eye, meaning some slightly orangy brown color. But if
      I dissolve some crystals into a few drops of water I will get a
      blood red to bright red solution (depending on the concentration),
      exactly the same color as Mercurochrome. It has a slightly
      metallic chemical taste which somewhat reminded me of the taste of
      blood but it was much more tasteless (less bitter).<br>
      <br>
      Price: Most labs sell D,L-Adrenochrome(CAS:56-06-8) at 70 to
      100euros for 250mg. But I recently found another chemical supplier
      selling a product named 'Adrenochrome' at 110euros for 50g, the
      price difference is so huge that I first though it couldn't be the
      same compound that other suppliers were selling, but CAS number
      was 56-06-8 so it was definately the same Adrenochrome. Such a
      price difference seems strange to me, I thought maybe it could be
      one of the two enantiomers (instead of the D,L form) but this
      wouldn't be logical as separating two enantiomers is complicated
      and therefore one enantiomer alone should be more expensive than
      the DL form, and certainly not cheaper.<br>
      <br>
      Note: Adrenochrome is quickly oxidised and should be kept away
      from air, light, humidity and heat. Therefore it is kept in an
      airtight container which is put in the freezer. Even this way, it
      will slowly decompose so it should not be kept for too long before
      use…<br>

      <br>
      My experimentations with Adrenochrome:<br>
      <br>
      I had acquired D,L-Adrenochrome freebase (the one sold at 70euros
      for 250mg)<br>
      <br>
      first trial: I held 100mg under my tongue for 1 minute and then
      swallowed. Fast onset (about 5 minutes)<br>
      <br>
      second trial: I snorted 50mg. Onset: a few seconds.<br>
      <br>
      third trial : I smoked 25mg (vaporised in a crack pipe). Onset is
      almost instant.<br>
      <br>
      Note that I waited a few days between each trial.<br>
      <br>
      The three trials gave me the exact same effects, which were very
      light and really uninteresting (I wouldn't even call it a high).<br>
      <br>
      First, it's wasn't hallucinogen nor psychedelic. I had a feeling
      of warmth through my body, I felt a numbness in my hands and my
      head (possibly linked to the haemostatic effect), there was some
      slight sedation, and a very slight short lived euphoria (the
      euphoria was a slightly more pronouced when smoked, but still very
      short lived)<br>
      There's also some minor visual change (no visuals, just that I
      would see the room slightly differently than usual, but honestly
      that was some really minor change, a joint of hashish would have
      done the same, nothing really noticeable). There might be some
      slight myosis too (=little pupils), not really sure.<br>
      <br>
      To sum up, effects were extremely weak, absolutely not fun nor
      psychedelic in anyway, and short lived (I would say the slight
      initial euphoria is gone within 4-5 minutes, and the few strange
      feelings that I experience from the stuff are gone within about 1
      hour (I couldn't say the exact duration as I didn't really checked
      my watch)<br>
      Needless to say I was very disappointed by this uninteresting
      compound.<br>
      <br>
      The effects I had from it were flimsy, there was a definite effect
      on my vision and my mental state for sure but I would definitely
      not call it 'hallucinogenic'.<br>
      <br>
      SO, I might have wanted to try higher dosages just in case this
      could intensify any effects (let's say 250mg orally, 100mg snorted
      and 100mg vaporised), or I might have wanted to try the other
      adrenochrome (the one sold at 110euro/50g) just to make sure it is
      the same...but I didn't as I had better things to do with my money
      and I was pretty sure that even if this would give me some more
      effect, that would still be of poor recreational/spiritual
      interest.<br>
      <br>
      Also, about possible secondary effects of adrenochrome: as it is
      an haemostatic compound (prevents capillary bleeding during
      injury) it is not impossible that excessive use would end up
      causing blood circulation troubles, furthermore some scientists
      seem to say that adrenochrome is known to cause cardiovascular
      troubles.<br>
      <br>
      To conclude I would say that this is an uninteresting substance to
      my opinion, and furthermore it's possibly a dangerous one....<br>

      <br>
      At the time, I was unaware of Adrenochrome or 'Pink Adrenaline'. I
      acquired 1cc/mL of regular Epinephrine for the use of using it
      just to stay up and get the blood pumping. I was unable to use the
      Epinephrine as soon as I got it and was not able to use it for a
      5-day period. During this period, the 1cc/mL of Epinephrine was
      stored in a 1cc/ml syringe with the normal needle cover over it in
      my sock drawer. After this period of time, I pulled the syringe
      out of my sock drawer, I had noticed the substance in the syringe
      had turned a pinkish color.<br>
      <br>
      Not knowing of any chemical changes having occurred, I injected
      1cc of the substance in my main arm vein. Within seconds, my heart
      was racing, I was sweating profusely, and a headache that could of
      brought down an elephant. The headache consisted of severe,
      throbbing pain (and when I mean severe, I mean severe, the worst
      headache imaginable). The headache, sweating, and rapid heartbeat
      lasted for about 2 hours, then vanished. At this point, I thought
      I was done with any of the effects. I was wrong. For the next 7
      days, I received periodic bouts of the same severe headaches but
      lasting anywhere from several seconds to several minutes up to 45
      minutes. The headaches were incapacitating. After that week, no
      other symptoms were felt. Well, I definitely got my heart pumping,
      but due to the severe headache, I would not recommend this. Also,
      I had absolutely no hallucinations unless I was hallucinating the
      headaches.<br>

      <div align="center"><big><b>Whistleblower doctor explains HORRIFIC
            reality dealing with Muslim invaders in Germany</b><br>
          <b>&nbsp;</b></big><br>
      </div>
      This is unbelievable.<b><br>
        <br>
      </b>A Czech doctor, who works in a German hospital, is so
      disgusted and overwhelmed with the Muslim migrant invaders that
      she is threatening to leave the country and go back home to the
      Czech Republic. She explains, via an email letter (because the
      press is forbidden from reporting on this), how horrific the
      conditions are in these hospitals, with the Muslim invaders
      bringing diseases they weren’t even prepared to treat. But that’s
      just part of it. The superior attitudes of these Muslims and their
      belief that they should get everything for free is wreaking havoc
      everywhere, from the hospitals to the pharmacies.<b><br>
        <br>
      </b>Eyewitness from a Munich hospital:<br>
      <br>
      A friend in Prague has a friend, who, as a retired physician, had
      returned to work at a Munich area hospital where they needed an
      anaesthesiologist. I correspond with her and she forwarded me her
      email. Yesterday, at the hospital we had a meeting about how the
      situation here and at the other Munich hospitals is unsustainable.
      Clinics cannot handle emergencies, so they are starting to send
      everything to the hospitals.<br>
      <br>
      Many Muslims are refusing treatment by female staff and, we,
      women, are refusing to go among those animals, especially from
      Africa. Relations between the staff and migrants are going from
      bad to worse. Since last weekend, migrants going to the hospitals
      must be accompanied by police with K-9 units.<br>
      <br>
      Many migrants have AIDS, syphilis, open TB and many exotic
      diseases that we, in Europe, do not know how to treat them. If
      they receive a prescription in the pharmacy, they learn they have
      to pay cash. This leads to unbelievable outbursts, especially when
      it is about drugs for the children. They abandon the children with
      pharmacy staff with the words: “So, cure them here yourselves!” So
      the police are not just guarding the clinics and hospitals, but
      also large pharmacies.<br>
      <br>
      Truly we said openly: Where are all those who had welcomed in
      front of TV cameras, with signs at train stations?! Yes, for now,
      the border has been closed, but a million of them are already here
      and we will definitely not be able to get rid of them.<br>
      <br>
      Until now, the number of unemployed in Germany was 2.2 million.
      Now it will be at least 3.5 million. Most of these people are
      completely unemployable. A bare minimum of them have any
      education. What is more, their women usually do not work at all. I
      estimate that one in ten is pregnant. Hundreds of thousands of
      them have brought along infants and little kids under six, many
      emaciated and neglected. If this continues and German re-opens its
      borders, I’m going home to the Czech Republic. Nobody can keep me
      here in this situation, not even double the salary than at home. I
      went to Germany, not to Africa or the Middle East.<br>
      <br>
      Even the professor who heads our department told us how sad it
      makes him to see the cleaning woman, who for 800 Euros cleans
      every day for years, and then meets young men in the hallways who
      just wait with their hand outstretched, want everything for free,
      and when they don’t get it they throw a fit.<br>
      <br>
      I really don’t need this! But I’m afraid that if I return, that at
      some point it will be the same in the Czech Republic. If the
      Germans, with their nature cannot handle this, there in Czechia it
      would be total chaos. Nobody who has not come in contact with them
      has no idea what kind of animals they are, especially the ones
      from Africa, and how Muslims act superior to our staff, regarding
      their religious accommodation.<br>
      <br>
      For now, the local hospital staff has not come down with the
      diseases they brought here, but, with so many hundreds of patients
      every day – this is just a question of time.<br>
      <br>
      In a hospital near the Rhine, migrants attacked the staff with
      knives after they had handed over an 8-month-old on the brink of
      death, which they had dragged across half of Europe for three
      months. The child died in two days, despite having received top
      care at one of the best pediatric clinics in Germany. The
      physician had to undergo surgery and two nurses are laid up in the
      ICU. Nobody has been punished.<br>
      <br>
      The local press is forbidden to write about it, so we know about
      it through email. What would have happened to a German if he had
      stabbed a doctor and nurses with a knife? Or if he had flung his
      own syphilis-infected urine into a nurse’s face and so threatened
      her with infection? At a minimum he’d go straight to jail and
      later to court. With these people – so far, nothing has happened.<br>
      <br>
      And so I ask, where are all those greeters and receivers from the
      train stations? Sitting pretty at home, enjoying their non-profits
      and looking forward to more trains and their next batch of cash
      from acting like greeters at the stations. If it were up to me I
      would round up all these greeters and bring them here first to our
      hospital’s emergency ward, as attendants. Then, into one building
      with the migrants so they can look after them there themselves,
      without armed police, without police dogs who today are in every
      hospital here in Bavaria, and without medical help.<b><br>

          <b>Dmitri Orlov</b><br>
        </div>
        <b><br>
        </b></b>It would be humorous if people weren't dying because of
      it<br>
      <br>
      I couldn't help but notice that over the past few weeks the Empire
      has become extremely silly—so silly that I believe it deserves the
      title of the World's Silliest Empire. One could claim that it has
      been silly before, but recent developments seem to signal a
      quantum leap in its silliness level.<br>
      <br>
      The first bit of extreme silliness surfaced when Gen. Lloyd J.
      Austin III, the head of the United States Central Command, told a
      Senate panel that only a very small number of Syrian fighters
      trained by the United States remained in the fight—perhaps as few
      as five.<br>
      <br>
      The tab for training and equipping them was $500 million. That's
      $100 million per fighter, but that's OK, because it's all good as
      long as the military contractors are getting paid. Things got even
      sillier when it later turned out that even these few fighters got
      car-jacked by ISIS/al Qaeda in Syria (whatever they are currently
      calling themselves) and got their vehicles and weapons taken away
      from them.<br>
      <br>
      General Austin's previous role as as Lt. General Casey in Tim
      Burton's film Mars Attacks! It was already a very silly role, but
      his current role is a definite career advancement, both in terms
      of rank and in terms of silliness level.<br>
      <br>
      The next silly moment arrived at the UN General Assembly meeting
      in New York, where Obama, who went on for 30 minutes instead of
      the allotted 15 (does Mr. Silly President know how to read a
      clock?) managed to use up all of this time and say absolutely
      nothing that made any sense to anyone.<br>
      <br>
      But it was Putin's speech that laid out the Empire's silliness for
      all to see when he scolded the US for making a bloody mess of the
      Middle East with its ham-handed interventions. The oft-repeated
      quote is “Do you understand what you have done?” but that's not
      quite right.<br>
      <br>
      The Russian «Вы хоть понимаете теперь, чего вы натворили?» can be
      more accurately translated as “How can you even now fail to
      understand what a mess you have made?”<br>
      <br>
      Words matter: this is not how one talks to a superpower before an
      assembly of the world's leaders; this is how one scolds a stupid
      and wayward child. In the eyes of the whole world, this made the
      Empire look rather silly.<br>
      <br>
      What happened next is that Russia announced the start of its
      bombing campaign against all manner of terrorists in Syria (and
      perhaps Iraq too; the Iraqi request is in Putin's in-box).<br>
      <br>
      What's notable about this bombing campaign is that it is entirely
      legal. The legitimate, elected government of Syria asked Russia
      for help; the campaign was approved by the Russian legislature.<br>
      <br>
      On the other hand, the bombing campaign that the US has been
      conducting in Syria is entirely illegal. There are exactly two
      ways to legally bomb the territory of another country: 1. an
      invitation from that country's government and 2. a UN Security
      Council resolution. The US has not obtained either of them.<br>
      <br>
      Why is this important? Because the UN, with its Security Council,
      was instituted to prevent war, by making it difficult for nations
      to engage each other militarily without all sorts of international
      economic and political repercussions. After World War II it was
      thought that wars are rather nasty and that something should be
      done to prevent them. <br>
      <br>
      But the US feels that this is rather unnecessary. When a Russian
      correspondent (Gayane Chichakyan from RT) asked the White House
      press secretary under what legal authority the US was bombing
      Syria, he at first pretended to not understand the question, then
      babbled incoherently, looking rather silly. <br>
      <br>
      You see, the US likes to fight wars (or rather, its military
      contractors like to fight wars, because that's how they make
      money, and they happen to own a big piece of the US government).
      But the US can't win any wars, and that makes its entire war
      effort rather silly (in a murderous sort of way).<br>
      <br>
      In spite of American recalcitrance, the UN does in fact prevent
      wars. Recently it prevented the US from mounting a “limited strike
      against the Assad regime in response to the brazen use of chemical
      weapons” (or so said Obama during his UN speech). This was helped
      by a deft bit of Russian diplomacy, in the course of which Syria
      voluntarily gave up its chemical weapons stockpiles. Undeterred by
      diplomacy, the US squeezed off a couple of cruise missiles in the
      general direction of Syria, but the Russians promptly shot them
      out of the sky, triggering a major rethink at the Pentagon and, of
      course, making the US look rather silly.<br>
      <br>
      But once you make a fool of yourself, why stop? Indeed, Obama
      shows no intention of stopping. Just about the entire audience at
      the UN General Assembly knew that the Syrian government's chemical
      attack on its own people never happened. The chemicals were
      provided by the Saudis and were unwittingly used by the Syrian
      rebels on themselves. Lying, when everybody knows that you are
      lying, and knows that you know that you are lying: what could
      possibly be sillier?<br>
      <br>
      Ok, how about continuously prattling on about “freedom and
      democracy”—in the Middle East, after throwing the whole region
      into chaos through their brain-dead interventions? The only voice
      of reason in the US seems to be that of Donald Trump, who recently
      declared that the Middle East was more stable under Saddam
      Hussein, Moammar Khaddafi and Bashar al Assad. Indeed it was. The
      fact that the only non-silly politician left in the US is
      Trump—that bloviating moneybag—sets a rather high bar for
      silliness for the country as a whole.<br>
      <br>
      Prattling on about “freedom and democracy” in the Middle East is
      also silly because the entire region is tribal—has been tribal for
      a few thousand years, and will be tribal for a few thousand more.
      In each locale, some tribe is on top. If the idea is to carve it
      up into sovereign territorial units (none of which qualifies as a
      nation, because each one ends up being multinational) then each
      territorial unit ends up being ruled by some tribe while others
      grumble. Blunder in and exploit their grumbling to bring about
      “regime change”—and the whole place invariably burns down.<br>
      <br>
      A case in point is Israel: it's got the top dog tribe—the Jews,
      and they can shoot or bomb anybody else with impunity. It is
      considered “democratic” because the Jews get to vote, which is
      very nice for the Jews. The Alawites in Syria get to vote too—and
      vote for Bashar al Assad—so why isn't that good enough? Because of
      American hypocrisy and double standards.<br>
      <br>
      It's like that right down the line. Saudi Arabia is owned by one
      tribe—the House of Saud, and everybody else is disenfranchised.
      Iraq used to be run by the Sunnis from Saddam Hussein's tribe, but
      the Americans dislodged them, and now what remains of it is ruled
      by the Shia from the south of the country while the Sunnis ran off
      and joined ISIS. This can all seem like super-simple stuff, but
      not for the Americans, because it runs counter to their ideology,
      which dictates that the world must be remade in America's image.
      And so they keep trying to do this (or keep pretending to be
      trying, because results don't matter as long as their military
      contractors get paid) and don't seem to care one bit that this is
      making them look very silly.<br>
      <br>
      And so the typical pattern has been this: the US bombs a country
      to smithereens, mounts a ground invasion, sets up a puppet regime
      and, promptly or not so promptly, pulls out. The puppet regime
      falls apart, and then you have either ungovernable chaos or some
      new, especially nasty form of dictatorship, or a little of each: a
      failed state, like Libya, and Yemen, and much of Afghanistan, Iraq
      and Syria. It doesn't much matter that this is the result (as long
      as the military contractors are getting paid) because America's
      motto seems to be “Look Silly and Carry On.” Wreck a country—and
      it's on to the next bombing campaign.<br>
      <br>
      But this is where it all gets meta-silly: in Syria they can't even
      achieve that. The Americans have been bombing ISIS for a year now;
      meanwhile, ISIS has gotten stronger and occupied more territory.
      But they haven't gotten around to overthrowing Assad; instead, the
      ISIS boys have been busy prancing around the desert in black head
      rags and white basketball shoes taking selfies, blowing up
      archaeological sites, enslaving women and beheading anyone they
      don't like.<br>
      <br>
      But now it appears that the Russians have achieved in five days of
      bombing what the Americans couldn't in a year and the ISIS boys
      are running away to Jordan; others want to go to Germany and ask
      for asylum. This has made the Americans upset, because, you see,
      the Russians were bombing “their” terrorists—the ones the
      Americans recruited, armed and trained… and then bombed? I know,
      silly—but true. The Russians will have none of that, because their
      approach is, if it looks like a terrorist and quacks like a
      terrorist, then it is a terrorist, so let's bomb it.<br>
      <br>
      But it is understandable that this approach is unpopular with the
      Americans: here they were carefully pumping the place full of
      weapons and equipment, and bombing carefully around the edges so
      as not to blow up any of it, and the Russians just blunder in and
      blow it all up! The Saudis are absolutely livid, because it was
      they who paid for much of it. Plus the terrorists are their own
      Wahhabi-Takfiri brethren—the ones who like to declare various
      other Muslims that they don't happen to like to be infidels, in
      direct violation of their own Sharia law. Does that remind you of
      anyone? Anyone silly?<br>
      <br>
      But it doesn't appear that the US can do anything to stop the
      Russians, or the Chinese who also want to get a piece of ISIS to
      stuff and mount, or the Iranians and the Hezbollah fighters who
      are ready to march in and mop up what remains of ISIS once the
      bombing missions destroy all the war materiel it has amassed. And
      so it's time for Americans to start an information war by accusing
      the Russians of causing civilian casualties.<br>
      <br>
      Of course, being Americans, they have to prosecute this
      information war in the silliest way possible. First, you trot out
      your claims of civilian casualties before the Russians fly a
      single sortie. Oops! Then you stuff the social media with fake
      pictures of wounded children produced beforehand by performers in
      white helmets paid for by George Soros. And then, when asked for
      evidence, you refuse to provide any.<br>
      <br>
      So far so good, but let's get even sillier. Immediately after
      screaming loudly about Russians causing civilian casualties, the
      Americans blow up a hospital in Afghanistan that was run by
      Medecins sans Frontières, in spite of being informed of its
      location both before and during the bombing. “Don't kill
      civilians… like this!” Could it get any sillier than that? Of
      course it can: the US can start blatantly, nakedly lying about the
      event: “There were Taleban fighters hiding in that hospital!”—no,
      there weren't; “The Afghans told us to bomb that hospital!”—no,
      they didn't. Bombing that hospital was an actual war crime—so says
      the UN. Are are the Russians now going to listen to criticism from
      war criminals? Don't be silly!<br>
      <br>
      It's really hard to tell, but anything seems possible now. For
      example, the US no longer seems to have a foreign policy: the
      White House says one thing, the State Department another, the
      Pentagon a third, Samantha Power at the UN pursues a foreign
      policy of her own using Twitter, and Senator John McCain wants to
      arm Syrian rebels to shoot down Russian planes. (All five of them?
      John, don't be silly!) In response to all this confusion,
      America's political puppets in the European Union are starting to
      twitch uncontrollably and go off-script, because the nerve center
      in Washington is no longer sending them clear signals.<br>
      <br>
      How is this all going to end? Well, since we are all just being
      silly, let me make a humble suggestion: the US should bomb
      everything inside the Beltway in Washington, plus a few counties
      in Virginia. That should significantly degrade the country's
      capability for being extremely silly. And if that doesn't work—so
      what? After all, it is clear that results don't matter. As long as
      the military contractors are getting paid, it's all good.<b><b><br>

            I advocate and defend a Civilization based on:<br>

            The ethical principle of a golden rule<br>
            Defending the victim and resisting the oppressor<br>
            The principle of rational thought<br>
            Free speech and expression<br>
            Freedom of ideas<br>

            <br>
            Ethical dualism<br>
            Authoritative thought<br>
            Suppression of speech and ideas<br>
            The oppression of women and other human rights<br>
            The use of force, violence and power to silence ideas<br>
            <br>
            I support the use of logic, reason, humor, irony, and satire
            to criticize ideas and people. I reject political
            correctness, multiculturalism, name calling and insults.<br>

      certainly not upon the rank idiocy of Muslim belief. Christianity
      has a great many faults and much bad history, but nothing so
      disgraceful to the human spirit as the Muslim travesty of
      "surrender". A true God does not demand submission, but rather
      only gratitude and your best effort -- including to fight in
      defense against barbarian stupidity ( starting with your own, and
      epitomized by jihadists ).<br>

      first year of the millennium as a web-based, live, and interactive
      forum for exploring water and its myriad processes within the
      universe. Such explorations encompass the sciences, ancient
      traditions, naturalism, and related disciplines that present an
      opportunity to consciously formulate, or reformulate, perceptions
      of water. In this capacity, there is an emphasis on exploring and
      coalescing diverse perspectives and insights. A key to meeting our
      challenges with water may be moving beyond the commonly held views
      that created those challenges. Such a transition might emerge from
      our "knowing" water according to many different modalities<b><b><b><br>

            <br>
          </b></b></b>It looks like something from the Borg (read,
      cool), but it’s actually a cast for healing bones.<br>
      <br>
      The Osteoid, created by Turkish student Deniz Karasahin,
      incorporates 3D printing and ultrasonic tech to make healing a
      broken bone more bearable.<br>
      <br>
      The idea of ultrasonic healing vibrations to heal bones (and other
      wounds) has been around for a while. But the problem was doctors
      couldn’t get past the plaster cast to apply the vibrational
      therapy.<br>
      <br>
      Take a look at the pic below and you’ll see the Osteoid’s skeletal
      design allows ultrasonic drivers to be placed directly on the
      skin.<br>
      <br>
      The Osteoid is just a prototype at the moment. However, future
      production will enable each individual to have a custom-fitted
      cast.<br>
      <br>
      Combine this cast with the accompanying low-intensity, pulsed
      ultrasound (LIPUS) bone stimulator system (shown above) and,
      according to Karasahin:<br>
      <br>
      For single 20 minute daily sessions this system promises to reduce
      the healing process up to 38% and increase the heal rate up to 80%
      in non-union fractures.<br>
      <br>
      The only downside is you won’t be able to get your friends to sign
      it anymore.<b><b><b><br>

          </b></b></b>It could be the answer to the rising threat of
      drones - a 'death ray' that uses radio waves to disable them from
      up to a mile away.<br>
      <br>
      The system is being shown off in Las Vegas amid growing concern
      over the threat from unmanned vehicles. <br>
      <br>
      It uses high powered radio waves to disable drones, effectively
      blocking their communication and switching them off in midair.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      'If I can see it, I can kill it,' said Rick Sondag, executive
      vice-president of Liteye Systems, which sells the device, and who
      debuted it at the Commercial Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) Expo in
      Las Vegas this week, according to the Guardian. <br>
      <br>
      Liteye, based in Colorado, was named distributor in the US and
      Canada for the device earlier this year by its three
      manufacturers: Enterprise, Chess Systems and Blighter.<br>
      <br>
      Sondaq hopes to sell the system to airports and other places where
      national security is an issue. <br>
      <br>
      'The US government, like everyone else, has critical
      infrastructure and if they don't feel like they can protect it,
      they'll pass laws that will hamper progress and hamper current
      use,' Sondag said.<br>
      <br>
      The system may be used in remote or urban areas to prevent UAVs
      being used for terrorist attacks, espionage or other undesirable
      activities against sites with critical infrastructure,' the firms
      say.<br>
      <br>
      'The Anti-UAV Defence System is likely to be an integral part of a
      wider networked surveillance and defence system. <br>
      <br>
      'Its soft kill capabilities make it a very attractive option for
      both military, internal and border security forces. <br>
      'Where the situation demands restraint under provocation and where
      active, yet discrete, deterrence is required, AUDS delivers a very
      powerful message.'<br>
      <br>
      Defences sources confirmed last month the British-designed system
      called AUDS – Anti Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Defence System – was
      trialled in Scotland earlier this year and proved effective
      against remote-controlled drones and autonomous drones which
      follow pre- programmed flight paths.<br>
      <br>
      The manufacturers of AUDS claim it takes between 10 and 15 seconds
      to target and disrupt multiple drones being flown in a ‘swarm
      attack’. <br>
      <br>
      The technology has been designed to intercept civilian grade
      mini-drones and would not affect commercial or military aircraft,
      which use encrypted communications.<b><b><b><br>

            Thomas Ormerod’s team of security officers faced a seemingly
            impossible task. At airports across Europe, they were asked
            to interview passengers on their history and travel plans.
            Ormerod had planted a handful of people arriving at security
            with a false history, and a made-up future – and his team
            had to guess who they were. In fact, just one in 1000 of the
            people they interviewed would be deceiving them. Identifying
            the liar should have been about as easy as finding a needle
            in a haystack.<br>
            <br>
            Using previous methods of lie detection, you might as well
            just flip a coin <br>
            <br>
            So, what did they do? One option would be to focus on body
            language or eye movements, right? It would have been a bad
            idea. Study after study has found that attempts – even by
            trained police officers – to read lies from body language
            and facial expressions are more often little better than
            chance. According to one study, just 50 out of 20,000 people
            managed to make a correct judgement with more than 80%
            accuracy. Most people might as well just flip a coin.<br>
            <br>
            Ormerod’s team tried something different – and managed to
            identify the fake passengers in the vast majority of cases.
            Their secret? To throw away many of the accepted cues to
            deception and start anew with some startlingly
            straightforward techniques.<br>
            <br>
            Over the last few years, deception research has been plagued
            by disappointing results. Most previous work had focused on
            reading a liar’s intentions via their body language or from
            their face – blushing cheeks, a nervous laugh, darting eyes.
            The most famous example is Bill Clinton touching his nose
            when he denied his affair with Monica Lewinsky – taken at
            the time to be a sure sign he was lying. The idea, says
            Timothy Levine at the University of Alabama in Birmingham,
            was that the act of lying provokes some strong emotions –
            nerves, guilt, perhaps even exhilaration at the challenge –
            that are difficult to contain. Even if we think we have a
            poker face, we might still give away tiny flickers of
            movement known as “micro-expressions” that might give the
            game away, they claimed.<br>
            <br>
            The problem is the huge variety of human behaviour – there
            is no universal dictionary of body language <br>
            <br>
            Yet the more psychologists looked, the more elusive any
            reliable cues appeared to be. The problem is the huge
            variety of human behaviour. With familiarity, you might be
            able to spot someone’s tics whenever they are telling the
            truth, but others will probably act very differently; there
            is no universal dictionary of body language. “There are no
            consistent signs that always arise alongside deception,”
            says Ormerod, who is based at the University of Sussex. “I
            giggle nervously, others become more serious, some make eye
            contact, some avoid it.” Levine agrees: “The evidence is
            pretty clear that there aren’t any reliable cues that
            distinguish truth and lies,” he says. And although you may
            hear that our subconscious can spot these signs even if they
            seem to escape our awareness, this too seems to have been
            disproved.<br>
            <br>
            Despite these damning results, our safety often still hinges
            on the existence of these mythical cues. Consider the
            screening some passengers might face before a long-haul
            flight – a process Ormerod was asked to investigate in the
            run up to the 2012 Olympics. Typically, he says, officers
            will use a “yes/no” questionnaire about the flyer’s
            intentions, and they are trained to observe “suspicious
            signs” (such as nervous body language) that might betray
            deception. “It doesn’t give a chance to listen to what they
            say, and think about credibility, observe behaviour change –
            they are the critical aspects of deception detection,” he
            says. The existing protocols are also prone to bias, he says
            – officers were more likely to find suspicious signs in
            certain ethnic groups, for instance. “The current method
            actually prevents deception detection,” he says.<br>
            <br>
            Clearly, a new method is needed. But given some of the
            dismal results from the lab, what should it be? Ormerod’s
            answer was disarmingly simple: shift the focus away from the
            subtle mannerisms to the words people are actually saying,
            gently probing the right pressure points to make the liar’s
            front crumble.<br>
            <br>
            Ormerod and his colleague Coral Dando at the University of
            Wolverhampton identified a series of conversational
            principles that should increase your chances of uncovering
            deceit:<br>
            <br>
            Use open questions. This forces the liar to expand on their
            tale until they become entrapped in their own web of deceit.<br>
            <br>
            Employ the element of surprise. Investigators should try to
            increase the liar’s “cognitive load” – such as by asking
            them unanticipated questions that might be slightly
            confusing, or asking them to report an event backwards in
            time – techniques that make it harder for them to maintain
            their façade.<br>
            <br>
            Watch for small, verifiable details. If a passenger says
            they are at the University of Oxford, ask them to tell you
            about their journey to work. If you do find a contradiction,
            though, don’t give yourself away – it’s better to allow the
            liar’s confidence to build as they rattle off more
            falsehoods, rather than correcting them.<br>
            <br>
            Observe changes in confidence. Watch carefully to see how a
            potential liar’s style changes when they are challenged: a
            liar may be just as verbose when they feel in charge of a
            conversation, but their comfort zone is limited and they may
            clam up if they feel like they are losing control.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Liar vs liar</b><b><br>
            </b><br>
            It takes one to know one<br>
            <br>
            Ironically, liars turn out to be better lie detectors.
            Geoffrey Bird at University College London and colleagues
            recently set up a game in which subjects had to reveal true
            or false statements about themselves. They were also asked
            to judge each other’s credibility. It turned out that people
            who were better at telling fibs could also detect others’
            tall tales, perhaps because they recognised the tricks.<br>
            <br>
            The aim is a casual conversation rather than an intense
            interrogation. Under this gentle pressure, however, the liar
            will give themselves away by contradicting their own story,
            or by becoming obviously evasive or erratic in their
            responses. “The important thing is that there is no magic
            silver bullet; we are taking the best things and putting
            them together for a cognitive approach,” says Ormerod.<br>
            <br>
            <b>A psychological experiment in an airport revealed new
              tricks to spot liars </b><br>
            <br>
            Ormerod openly admits his strategy might sound like common
            sense. “A friend said that you are trying to patent the art
            of conversation,” he says. But the results speak for
            themselves. The team prepared a handful of fake passengers,
            with realistic tickets and travel documents. They were given
            a week to prepare their story, and were then asked to line
            up with other, genuine passengers at airports across Europe.
            Officers trained in Ormerod and Dando’s interviewing
            technique were more than 20 times more likely to detect
            these fake passengers than people using the suspicious
            signs, finding them 70% of the time.<br>
            <br>
            “It’s really impressive,” says Levine, who was not involved
            in this study. He thinks it is particularly important that
            they conducted the experiment in real airports. “It’s the
            most realistic study around.”<br>
            <br>
            <b>The art of persuasion</b><b><br>
            </b><br>
            Levine’s own experiments have proven similarly powerful.
            Like Ormerod, he believes that clever interviews designed to
            reveal holes in a liar’s story are far better than trying to
            identify tell-tale signs in body language. He recently set
            up a trivia game, in which undergraduates played in pairs
            for a cash prize of $5 for each correct answer they gave.
            Unknown to the students, their partners were actors, and
            when the game master temporarily left the room, the actor
            would suggest that they quickly peek at the answers to cheat
            on the game. A handful of the students took him up on the
            offer.<br>
            <br>
            One expert was even correct 100% of the time, across 33
            interviews <br>
            <br>
            Afterwards, the students were all questioned by real federal
            agents about whether or not they had cheated. Using tactical
            questions to probe their stories – without focusing on body
            language or other cues – they managed to find the cheaters
            with more than 90% accuracy; one expert was even correct
            100% of the time, across 33 interviews – a staggering result
            that towers above the accuracy of body language analyses.
            Importantly, a follow-up study found that even novices
            managed to achieve nearly 80% accuracy, simply by using the
            right, open-ended questions that asked, for instance, how
            their partner would tell the story.<br>
            <br>
            Indeed, often the investigators persuaded the cheaters to
            openly admit their misdeed. “The experts were fabulously
            good at this,” says Levine. Their secret was a simple trick
            known to masters in the art of persuasion: they would open
            the conversation by asking the students how honest they
            were. Simply getting them to say they told the truth primed
            them to be more candid later. “People want to think of being
            honest, and this ties them into being cooperative,” says
            Levine. “Even the people who weren’t honest had difficulty
            pretending to be cooperative [after this], so for the most
            part you could see who was faking it.”<br>
            <br>
            <b>Another trick is to ask people how honest they are </b><b><br>
            </b><br>
            Clearly, such tricks may already be used by some expert
            detectives – but given the folklore surrounding body
            language, it’s worth emphasising just how powerful
            persuasion can be compared to the dubious science of body
            language. Despite their successes, Ormerod and Levine are
            both keen that others attempt to replicate and expand on
            their findings, to make sure that they stand up in different
            situations. “We should watch out for big sweeping claims,”
            says Levine.<br>
            <br>
            Although the techniques will primarily help law enforcement,
            the same principles might just help you hunt out the liars
            in your own life. “I do it with kids all the time,” Ormerod
            says. The main thing to remember is to keep an open mind and
            not to jump to early conclusions: just because someone looks
            nervous, or struggles to remember a crucial detail, does not
            mean they are guilty. Instead, you should be looking for
            more general inconsistencies.<br>
            <br>
            There is no fool-proof form of lie detection, but using a
            little tact, intelligence, and persuasion, you can hope that
            eventually, the truth will out.<br>

            Every time we made headway on an important issue, Kevin
            Folta, who claimed to be an unbiased scientist, was there to
            refute our claims and throw some ad hominem attacks. Here

              </b>
              <div align="left"><b> </b>In Part 1 of this article I
                discussed the catalyst spark which ignited this Fourth
                Turning and the seemingly delayed regeneracy. In Part 2
                I pondered possible Grey Champion prophet generation
                leaders who could arise during the regeneracy. In Part 3
                I will focus on the economic channel of distress which
                is likely to be the primary driving force in the next
                phase of this Crisis.<small><br>
                </small> <small><br>
                </small> There are very few people left on this earth
                who lived through the last Fourth Turning (1929 – 1946).
                The passing of older generations is a key component in
                the recurring cycles which propel the world through the
                seemingly chaotic episodes that paint portraits on the
                canvas of history. The current alignment of generations
                is driving this Crisis and will continue to give impetus
                to the future direction of this Fourth Turning. The
                alignment during a Fourth Turning is always the same:
                Old Artists (Silent) die, Prophets (Boomers) enter
                elderhood, Nomads (Gen X) enter midlife, Heroes
                (Millennials) enter young adulthood—and a new generation
                of child Artists (Gen Y) is born. This is an era in
                which America’s institutional life is torn down and
                rebuilt from the ground up—always in response to a
                perceived threat to the nation’s very survival.<small><br>
                </small> <small><br>
                </small> For those who understand the theory, there is
                the potential for impatience and anticipating dire
                circumstances before the mood of the country turns in
                response to the 2nd or 3rd perilous incident after the
                initial catalyst. Neil Howe anticipates the climax of
                this Crisis arriving in the 2022 to 2025 time frame,
                with the final resolution happening between 2026 and
                2029. Any acceleration in these time frames would likely
                be catastrophic, bloody, and possibly tragic for
                mankind. As presented by Strauss and Howe, this Crisis
                will continue to be driven by the core elements of debt,
                civic decay, and global disorder, with the volcanic
                eruption traveling along channels of distress and
                aggravating problems ignored, neglected, or denied for
                the last thirty years. Let’s examine the channels of
                distress which will surely sway the direction of this
                Crisis...<small><br>

            </b><br>
            A few days ago (1st week of September 2015) a large
            microwave pulse anomaly was seen on the MIMIC-TPW microwave
            background composite imagery.<br>
            <br>
            <div align="center"><img alt="" src="dutchsinse.jpg"
                height="291" width="474"><br>
            </div>
            <br>
            The pulse appeared across the whole planet, but was funneled
            down to a fine point (spiral) over New Zealand.<br>
            <br>
            I made a video showing my viewers after this event occurred,
            and told them to possibly watch for an earthquake to strike
            the pulse point near New Zealand.<br>
            <br>
            Since issuing the warning, New Zealand has been hit by TWO
            different M6.0+ events just North of the main island.<br>
            <br>
            This seismic activity comes after weeks (months) without
            seeing much activity at this location.<br>
            <br>
            Just a few days after this energy pulse hit, TWO back to
            back earthquakes (above M6.0)&nbsp; struck .&nbsp; It
            appears the two events were / are indeed related...<br>

            </b>Welcome to the world of fractal flames!<br>
            <br>
            Let's start at the very basics: what is a fractal? A fractal
            is a mathematical construct, first and foremost. But most
            people call the visual representation of said mathematical
            construct "fractal" as well. A fractal image is usually
            entirely computer generated and are the key to combine
            mathematics with art.<br>
            <br>
            One class of fractals are so called iterated function
            systems. Simply expressed, these fractals work by taking a
            simple shape and copying it onto itself into theoretical
            infinity. The most prominent example is the sierpinski
            gasket. The shape, in this case, would be a triangle. If you
            now extend this concept into a general context, you
            understood how an iterated function system works.<br>
            <br>
            In classic iterated function systems, transformations during
            copying a shape are affine. This means simplified: only
            move, rotate, scale and skew transformations are allowed.
            Fractal flames now generalize even further and also allow
            the combination of affine transformations with any
            non-linear function. This would mean that you don't limit
            yourself to moving, rotating, scaling and skewing a shape
            before copying it but also allow any mathematical function
            to be applied on the shape to further distort the resulting
            copy.<br>
            <br>
            With this gain of complexity combined with a natural
            coloring algorithm, fractal flame artists achieve the
            typical organic look of their works. <br>

                  seismic pressure transfers up to 1,000km — Causing
                  other earthquakes</b></big><br>
            </div>
            <b> </b>September 22, 2015<br>
            <br>
            Scientists have now “discovered” something that I have been
            telling (and showing) my viewers / readers for the past
            several years.<br>
            <br>
            Seismic pressure caused by large earthquake activity is
            causing other earthquakes up to 1,000km away.<br>
            <br>
            These new findings, made by Italian scientists, indicate
            seismic pressure is causing “particles” in the Earth’s crust
            to vibrate (resonate) on a certain frequency which induces
            particulate matter to slip along far adjacent fault zones.<br>
            <br>
            In otherwords, pressure from a large earthquake can cause
            vibration on layers of the crust several hundred to over a
            1,000km away from the original earthquake epicenter.<br>
            <br>
            Simply put, a large earthquake can cause another earthquake
            far away.<br>
            <br>
            We see this happen across the North American Craton every
            few weeks, earthquake progression where seismic pressure in
            one area causes an earthquake in another region.<br>
            <br>
            Up until now, professionals have literally been frequenting
            my pages (and videos) DENYING that earthquakes are related
            across large distances like this.<br>
            <br>
            Now these denying professionals are corrected by other
            professional researchers.&nbsp; As if showing everyone via
            my videos for the past few years isn’t proof enough.<br>

            How earthquakes can trigger copycat quakes 1000 kilometres
            away<br>
            <br>
            “Seismic waves unleashed during Wednesday’s magnitude 8.3
            earthquake in Chile could have triggered aftershocks as far
            as 1000 kilometres away.<br>
            <br>
            That’s because they can shake up grains of rock wedged
            inside distant faults. According to computer models, even
            weak waves at the right frequency could be enough to start a
            new quake by vibrating that grist into a more slippery,
            liquid-like layer...<br>

            This series by Carl Cameron,which Fox News released in 2001
            was supposed to have 12 parts. Only 4 parts ever got
            broadcast, and all 4 are in this ONE MP3. Even these 4 parts
            should be enough to wake your sleeping zombie sheep, they
            prove Israel is raping the U.S. and was heavily involved in
            911 And it all went out on FOX NEWS, IT IS ALL HERE, ARCHIVE
            AND POST!!!<br>
            <br>
            <b>Key points:</b><b><br>
            </b><b> </b><br>
            1. After 911, Israeli companies tipped off perpetrators of
            911 to when the FBI, CIA an other American intelligence was
            onto them, so they could immediately change their identities
            and prevent the investigations from proceeding.
            Additionally, once the investigations started, the
            perpetrators were given the ability to wire tap all of the
            investigator's phones and other communications via Israeli
            owned companies and spy infrastructure, to totally
            circumvent capture. If this does not by itself prove Israel
            did 911, I do not know what possibly could.<br>
            <br>
            2. Israeli companies tip off Israeli drug dealers to when
            American investigation efforts have pinned them down, and
            like the perpetrators of 911, the Israelis then provide even
            drug dealers with wire taps on the investigators in pursuit
            of them, to help them completely evade capture...<br>

              Big agrochemical companies such as Dow, Bayer and Monsanto
              are experimenting with a range of new genetic engineering
              (GE) techniques that they misleadingly refer to as ‘New
              Plant Breeding Techniques’. These are being used to
              introduce traits such as herbicide and pathogen resistance
              and changed nutritional properties into commercial crop
              varieties that will ultimately end up in our food. By
              arguing that these techniques are precise, just like
              conventional breeding, and not really genetic engineering
              at all, these companies are attempting to circumvent
              regulation, labelling and public opposition.<br>
              <br>
              Sound familiar? Well that’s because it is. These are
              exactly the same arguments that these companies used to
              defend GE crops. Only – according to industry – this time
              it’s actually true. These new GE techniques include
              cisgenics, zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs) and CRISPR /Cas9
              (1). Much of what has been written on them has been highly
              technical and fairly impenetrable to the layperson – which
              is of course exactly the way industry wants to keep it.
              Where these techniques have received mainstream media
              attention, unfortunately journalists have largely
              uncritically parroted industry’s claims that these
              techniques can be used to precisely edit DNA.<br>
              <br>
              However, you don’t have to delve too deep to find that –
              as in the case of traditional genetic engineering
              –industry claims simply don’t stand up to scrutiny. Both
              ZFNs and CRISPR/Cas9 have been touted as precise gene
              editing techniques, but scientists have been reporting
              unexpected effects because the techniques also affect
              genes other than the target genes.&nbsp; For example, a
              recent study found that CRISPR-Cas9 can result in hundreds
              of unexpected mutations.<br>
              <br>
              CRISPR-Cas9 recently received mainstream media coverage
              earlier this year when Chinese scientists used the
              technique to genetically engineer human embryos. The
              technique didn’t work too well – prompting scientists to
              call for a moratorium on its use because it’s not
              safe.&nbsp; Unfortunately however scientists don’t seem to
              have similar qualms about conducting uncontrolled
              experiments with our staple food crops.<br>
              <br>
              S<b>o what are our regulators doing?</b><br>
              <br>
              Most alarmingly of all it appears that these techniques
              are not and – on current course – may not be regulated in
              Australia. Furthermore, genetic engineers are arguing that
              these techniques are not really genetic engineering in an
              effort to bypass the existing regulation of genetically
              modified organisms (GMOs). On its website dedicated to ZFN
              techniques (which it dubs “EzxactPrecision” technology),
              Dow claims:<br>
              <br>
              “The Australian Government, Office of the Gene Technology
              Regulator (OGTR) has responded to Dow AgroSciences stating
              that crops developed using EXZACT Delete technology would
              not contain introduced foreign nucleic acid, once the ZFN
              genes are no longer present, and would not be considered
              GMO and not subject to regulation under the Gene
              Technology Act 2000.”<br>
              <br>
              In 2012 our food regulator Food Standards Australia New
              Zealand (FSANZ) convened an expert panel – comprised
              almost entirely of genetic engineers with a vested
              interest in the technology – to look at whether these new
              techniques would be considered genetic engineering. The
              panel concluded that:<br>
              <br>
              “The changes introduced using ZFN-1 and ZFN-2 [using
              zinc-finger nuclease to delete, substitute or insert a few
              base pairs] will be small, definable and the outcomes
              predictable. Food derived from plants modified using ZFN-1
              and ZFN- 2 would be similar to food produced using
              traditional mutagenic techniques, and should therefore not
              be regarded as GM food.”<br>
              <br>
              This conclusion is in marked contrast to recent research
              papers on the topic, which have found numerous unintended
              mutations in organisms modified by ZFN and
              CRISPR-Cas9.&nbsp; As one of the researchers investigating
              these effects in CRISP-Ca9 observes “you only find things
              where you look for them.”&nbsp; It also contradicts the
              definition of gene technology in the Australia New Zealand
              Food Standards Code. This defines gene technology as
              “recombinant DNA techniques that alter the heritable
              genetic material of living cells or organisms.”<br>
              <br>
              GE proponents have also argued that cisgenics – which is
              genetic engineering where the introduced traits/genetic
              material are from the same or closely related species pose
              no greater risks than conventional breeding. However
              cisgenic techniques allow for genetic material from within
              the same species to be so significantly rearranged that
              the result could be genetic constructs and traits equally
              as foreign as when donor DNA from outside the species is
              used. As Professor of Genetics and Molecular Biology at
              Canterbury University, Jack Heinemann, points out:<br>
              <br>
              “The cisgeneticist is confined to no minimum string length
              for manipulation and thus, from the raw building blocks
              common to all genomes, can create strings just as
              “foreign” to that same genome as any that came from a
              different species. Any gene from a human being could be
              rearranged to become 2%, 50% or 70% different from itself
              and as different as the average gene from a human was to
              the average gene from a single-celled soil microorganism.”<br>
              <br>
              <b>What kind of food future do we want?</b><b><br>
              </b><br>
              Scientists have observed that some of the adverse effects
              associated with genetically engineered crops are a result
              of changed agricultural practices associated with the crop
              rather than the technology used to produce the crop
              variety itself.&nbsp; For example a 2012 study found that
              herbicide-resistant crop technology has led to a 239,000
              tonne increase in herbicide use in the United States
              between 1996 and 2011.&nbsp; Herbicide tolerance can also
              be developed using non-GM techniques – but is this really
              the path that we want to go down? – not according to the
              UN.<br>
              <br>
              In 2013 UNCTAD, the UN trade and development body,
              released a report stating that it is time for Governments
              from all nations to change their agriculture system before
              it is too late. The report recommends a shift from
              monoculture towards greater varieties of crops, reduced
              use of fertilisers and other inputs, greater support for
              small-scale farmers, and more locally focused production
              and consumption of food.<br>
              What is needed?<br>
              <br>
              The scientists concerned about human genome editing have
              called for a ban and an international debate on the issue
              – including the public as well as experts and academics.
              Friends of the Earth believes this ban should be extended
              to the commercialisation and environmental release of all
              organisms modified using these techniques – until their
              safety and the ethics of their use can be properly
              assessed.<br>
              <br>
              We also need a paradigm shift when it comes agriculture in
              Australia and a move away from the chemical treadmill
              being foisted on farmers by agrochemical companies such as
              Bayer, Monsanto and Dow. Ecological farming supports
              nature and people by protecting the soil, water and
              climate. It promotes biodiversity, ensures sustainable
              farming and healthy food for today and in the long-term,
              and does not contaminate the environment with chemical
              inputs or genetic engineering. They are not necessary for
              the growth and sustenance we need. We know what the
              solutions are. What is the Australian Government waiting
              for?<br>
              GE 2.0 – a user guide<br>
              <br>
              A range of new techniques are being used to genetically
              engineer plants. Here are some of the main ones:<br>
              <br>
              Cell fusion: This involves fusing two cells from separate
              plants to produce a hybrid cell. It allows the genes from
              unrelated species to be combined.<br>
              <br>
              Oligo-directed mutagenesis: This involves introducing
              molecules (oligonucleotides) that are complementary to the
              DNA and bind to it in all but a single or a few places.
              These creates sequence mismatches, allowing targeted
              mutations to be introduced.<br>
              <br>
              Nuclease-mediated site-directed mutagenesis: These
              techniques use enzymes to cut DNA at specific sites so
              that genes can be deleted or new genes inserted. These
              techniques include zinc-finger nucleases (ZFN),
              transcription activator-like nucleases (TALEN) and
              CRISPR/Cas nucleases.<br>
              <br>
              Cisgenics and intragenesis: These terms refer to genetic
              engineering where the introduced traits/genetic material
              are from the same or closely related species.<br>
              <br>
              A fuller explanation of these techniques and the risks
              associated with them can be found in the Austrian
              Environment Agency’s publication New plant breeding
              techniques: risks associated with their application.<br>

              months! Using SALt lamp 8 hours a day every day, with
              proper maintenance, will give you an anode lifespan of 6
              months. Use this as an alternative light source will

              If you are living along the coastline, no need to create
              your saline solution, instead... use the ocean water to
              operate your lamp.<br>

              The salinity of ocean-water can operate your lamp. Use the
              ocean-water to power up your lamp and it will give you 8
              hours of running-time. Salinity is expressed by the amount
              of salt found in 1,000 grams of water. The average ocean
              salinity is 35 parts per thousand. Store ocean-water in
              bottles and use them to power up you lamp anytime,
              anywhere.<br>

              Once slavery was abolished in 1865, manufacturers
              scrambled to find other sources of cheap labor—and because
              the 13th amendment banned slavery (except as punishment
              for crimes), they didn’t have to look too far. Prisons and
              big businesses have now been exploiting this loophole in
              the 13th amendment for over a century.<br>
              <br>
              “Insourcing,” as prison labor is often called, is an even
              cheaper alternative to outsourcing. Instead of sending
              labor over to China or Bangladesh, manufacturers have
              chosen to forcibly employ the 2.4 million incarcerated
              people in the United States. Chances are high that if a
              product you’re holding says it is “American Made,” it was
              made in an American prison.<br>
              <br>
              On average, prisoners work 8 hours a day, but they have no
              union representation and make between .23 and $1.15 per
              hour, over 6 times less than federal minimum wage. These
              low wages combined with increasing communication and
              commissary costs mean that inmates are often released from
              correctional facilities with more debt than they had on
              their arrival. Meanwhile, big businesses receive tax
              credits for employing these inmates in excess of millions
              of dollars a year.<br>
              <br>
              While almost every business in America uses some form of
              prison labor to produce their goods, here are just a few
              of the companies who are helping prisoners pay off their
              debt to society, so to speak....<br>

              </b><b> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b><br>
              Also implicit in the past and present use of prison labor
              are Microsoft, Nike, Nintendo, Honda, Pfizer, Saks Fifth
              Avenue, JCPenney, Macy’s, Starbucks, and more. For an even

              germicidal and antimicrobial agent that penetrates beneath
              the skin to where the bacteria actually resides. It will
              destroy even drug-resistant bacteria and is now used for
              infection control in hospitals worldwide.

              <div align="center"><b> </b><big><b>Asparagus 'cures'
                    cancer?</b></big><br>
              </div>
              <b> </b><br>
              Several years ago, I had a man seeking asparagus for a
              friend who had cancer. He gave me a photocopied copy of an
              article, entitled, 'Asparagus for cancer' printed in
              Cancer News Journal, December 1979. I will share it here,
              just as it was shared with me: 'I am a biochemist, and
              have specialized in the relation of diet to health for
              over 50 years. Several years ago, I learned of the
              discovery of Richard R. Vensal, D.D.S. that asparagus
              might cure cancer. Since then, I have worked with him on
              his project. We have accumulated a number of favourable
              case histories.<br>
              <br>
              Here are a few examples:<br>
              <br>
              Case No. 1, - A man with an almost hopeless case of
              Hodgkin's disease (cancer of the lymph glands) who was
              completely incapacitated. Within 1 year of starting the
              asparagus therapy, his doctors were unable to detect any
              signs of cancer, and he was back on a schedule of
              strenuous exercise.<br>
              <br>
              Case No. 2, - A successful businessman 68 years old who
              suffered from cancer of the bladder for 16 years. After
              years of medical treatments, including radiation without
              improvement, he went on asparagus. Within 3 months,
              examinations revealed that his bladder tumor had
              disappeared and that his kidneys were normal.<br>
              <br>
              Case No. 3, - A man who had lung cancer. On March 5th
              1971, he was put on the operating table where they found
              lung cancer so widely spread that it was inoperable. The
              surgeon sewed him up and declared his case hopeless. On
              April 5th he heard about the asparagus therapy and
              immediately started taking it. By August, x-ray pictures
              revealed that all signs of the cancer had disappeared. He
              is back at his regular business routine.<br>
              <br>
              Case No. 4, - A woman who was troubled for a number of
              years with skin cancer. She finally developed different
              skin cancers which were diagnosed by asking specialist as
              advanced. Within 3 months after starting on asparagus, her
              skin specialist said that her skin looked fine and no more
              skin lesions. This woman reported that the asparagus
              therapy also cured her kidney disease, which started in
              1949. She had over 10 operations for kidney stones, and
              was receiving government disability payments for an
              inoperable, terminal, kidney condition. She attributes the
              cure of this kidney trouble entirely to the asparagus.<br>
              <br>
              I was not surprised at this result, as 'The elements of
              Materia Medica', edited in 1854 by a Professor at the
              University of Pennsylvania, stated that asparagus was used
              as a popular remedy for kidney stones. He even referred to
              experiments, in 1739, on the power of asparagus in
              dissolving stones.<br>
              <br>
              We would have other case histories but the medical
              establishment has interfered with our obtaining some of
              the records. I am therefore appealing to readers to spread
              this good news and help us to gather a large number of
              case histories that will overwhelm the medical skeptics
              about this unbelievably simple and natural remedy. For the
              treatment, asparagus should be cooked before using, and
              therefore canned asparagus is just as good as fresh.<br>
              <br>
              I have corresponded with the two leading canners of
              asparagus, Green Giant and Stokely, and I am satisfied
              that these brands contain no pesticides or preservatives.<br>
              <br>
              <b>PROCEDURE:</b><b><br>
              </b><br>
              1) Place the cooked asparagus in a blender and liquefy to
              make a puree, and store in the refrigerator.<br>
              <br>
              2) Give the patient 4 full tablespoons twice daily,
              morning and evening.<br>
              <br>
              Patients usually show some improvement in from 2-4 weeks.
              It can be diluted with water and used as a cold or hot
              drink. This suggested dosage is based on present
              experience, but certainly larger amounts can do no harm
              and may be needed in some cases.<br>
              <br>
              As a biochemist I am convinced of the old saying that
              'what cures can prevent'. Based on this theory, my wife
              and I have been using asparagus puree as a beverage with
              our meals.<br>
              <br>
              We take 2 tablespoons diluted in water to suit our taste
              with breakfast and with dinner. I take mine hot and my
              wife prefers hers cold. For years we have made it a
              practice to have blood surveys taken as part of our
              regular checkups.<br>
              <br>
              The last blood survey, taken by a medical doctor who
              specializes in the nutritional approach to health, showed
              substantial improvements in all categories over the last
              one, and we can attribute these improvements to nothing
              but the asparagus drink...<br>
              <br>
              As a biochemist, I have made an extensive study of all
              aspects of cancer, and all of the proposed cures. As a
              result, I am convinced that asparagus fits in better with
              the latest theories about cancer. Asparagus contains a
              good supply of protein called histones, which are believed
              to be active in controlling cell growth. For that reason,
              I believe asparagus can be said to contain a substance
              that I call cell growth normalizer. That accounts for its
              action on cancer and in acting as a general body tonic. In
              any event, regardless of theory,asparagus used as we
              suggest, is a harmless substance.<br>
              <br>
              The FDA cannot prevent you from using it and it may do you
              much good.. It has been reported by the US National Cancer
              Institute, that asparagus is the highest tested food
              containing glutathione, which is considered one of the
              body's most potent anticarcinogens and antioxidants.
              (Thanks to Paul Carlson for the headsup on this. - JWD) <br>

              Did you know that a lot of clinical studies find a
              disproportionately high number of female breast cancers
              originating in the upper outer quadrant of the breast, the
              area to which underarm cosmetic products are applied?
              Because breast tissue is mostly adipose, it’s a place
              where most toxins get stored.<br>
              <br>
              Most conventional deodorants and other body products that
              we use on a daily basis contain aluminum chlorohydrate,
              parabens, propylene glycol, triclosan, TEA, DEA, FD&amp;C
              colors, and quaternium 18, among other toxic chemicals.
              Some of these chemicals increase the risk of breast cancer
              by mimicking estrogen. Most breast cancer cases initially
              develop as hormone-dependent cancer, in which growth and
              progression of the disease correlates with estrogen
              levels.<br>
              <br>
              In a 2007 study published in the Journal of Inorganic
              Biochemistry, researchers tested breast samples from 17
              breast-cancer patients who had undergone mastectomies. The
              women who used antiperspirants had deposits of aluminum in
              their outer breast tissue. Concentrations of aluminum were
              higher in the tissue closest to the underarm than in the
              central breast.<br>
              <br>
              Parabens also increase the risk of breast cancer by
              mimicking estrogen, according to some experts. Researchers
              have found parabens inside autopsied breast tumors. Dr.
              Darbre comments on the study: “Parabens are used as
              preservatives in thousands of cosmetic, food, and
              pharmaceutical products, but this is the first study to
              show their accumulation in human tissues. It demonstrates
              that if people are exposed to these chemicals, then the
              chemicals will accumulate in their bodies.”<br>

              You have to understand, sweating is an important function
              of our body. Sweat contains chemicals that fight diseases.
              This is why it’s vital to keep the pores under your arms
              unclogged. Beneath the skin in the armpit is a cluster of
              lymph nodes that work to remove foreign cells.
              Chemical-laden products applied to the arm pit prevent
              this removal of toxins. Fortunately, you can do an armpit
              detox which can help your body to pull out stored toxins,
              chemical residue, and unclog your pores.<br>
              <br>
              How to Prevent Breast Cancer Through An Armpit Detox;<br>
              <br>
              <b>Ingredients</b><br>
              <br>
              1 tablespoon organic apple cider vinegar<br>
              3 drops Rosemary essential oil<br>
              5 drops Cilantro essential oil<br>
              1 tablespoon bentonite clay<br>
              <br>
              <b>Instructions</b><br>
              <br>
              Mix ACV and the clay in a glass bowl. Add the essential
              oils. It should look smooth like sour scream.<br>
              Spread a thin layer of this mixture on your armpit and
              leave it for a few minutes.<br>
              Rinse well and repeat daily until odor subsides and your
              natural deodorant is no longer irritating.<br>
              Repeat daily as needed.<br>
              Drink plenty of water during the detox, because your body
              needs to have a way to flush out all of the toxins. <br>

              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “A heavenly body possibly as large as
              the giant planet Jupiter and possibly so close to Earth
              that it would be part of this solar system has been found
              in the direction of the constellation Orion by an orbiting
              telescope aboard the U.S. infrared astronomical
              satellite.”<br>
              <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “So mysterious is the object that
              astronomers do not know if it is a planet, a giant comet,
              a nearby “protostar” that never got hot enough to become a
              star, a distant galaxy so young that it is still in the
              process of forming its first stars or a galaxy so shrouded
              in dust that none of the light cast by its stars ever gets
              through. “All I can tell you is that we don’t know what it
              is,” Dr. Gerry Neugebauer … said in an interview.”<br>

              ...For the first time in recorded history, Planet X
              sightings were being openly recorded.&nbsp; Mark Hazlewood
              reported observatory sightings from various parts of the
              world.&nbsp; He states: <br>
              &nbsp;<br>
              “Three separate sightings slipped out from different parts
              of the world.&nbsp; This represents a tiny percentage of
              the true number of sightings. The three <br>
              observatories were located in South America, Switzerland
              and Arizona.&nbsp; I include two of the sightings and show
              you where to find the third and future ones later.&nbsp; <br>
              <br>
              “Here is a short report from the Lowell Observatory in
              Arizona.&nbsp; <br>

              “A whole team was contacting every observatory in France,
              just sent a message. The Neuchatel observatory got
              it.&nbsp; They are very excited; wondering if it is a
              comet or a brown dwarf, through the latest coordinates
              given.&nbsp; The daughter of the astronomer reports that
              they suspect a comet or a brown dwarf on the process to
              becoming a pulsar since it emits ‘waves.’<br>
              <br>
              “These excited folkswho first sighted it told us, that we
              would get ‘at least’ an image; next there was a long
              silence for over a week.&nbsp; “<br>
              <br>
              Afterwards came the official denial that such a sighting
              had ever occurred at Neuchatel.&nbsp; As in most coverups,
              believe what is said first, and not what is retracted
              later.&nbsp; So they possess an image of Planet X.”&nbsp;

              2003:&nbsp; <br>
              As noted elsewhere in this article, this is the year that
              Nancy Lieder and Zeta-Talk predicted the supposed passage
              of Planet X in May but of course it turned out <br>
              to be a non-event.&nbsp; The purpose was to discredit
              serious research into the Planet X topic.&nbsp; It also
              covered up what was really happening at that time: <br>
              <br>
              The Brown Dwarf/Planet X system entered into our outer
              solar system that very year.&nbsp; This fact of an
              intruder coming into our solar system was mentioned by
              Planet X researcher, John DiNardo in his summary of the
              situation at the time.&nbsp; <br>
              <br>
              “I’ve been following Prof. James McCanney.&nbsp; In his
              April 21st interview on Coast to Coast, formerly hosted by
              Art Bell, McCanney said that solar hyperactivity indicates
              that a large celestial body has entered the outer boundary
              of our solar system.&nbsp; He recently went to Patagonia
              at the southern tip of South America where other
              astronomers are trying to sight in on the only section of
              the celestial sky in which an intruding object has not
              been ruled out.&nbsp; However, he says that the
              atmospheric haze is making it impossible to get a clear
              sighting. He says that the best point on Earth for viewing
              that southernmost sky is, of course, the Antartic, and
              only the people in government have the facilities to go
              there.&nbsp; He says that they are there now, doing
              sightings without reporting theiractivities.&nbsp; We have
              much documentation of the Sun’s hyperactivity over the
              last couple of years that convinces serious researchers
              such as Sherwood Ensey, tuatha@cybermesa.com that there is
              a large intruder planet coming in.”&nbsp; [“Recent Summary
              From John DiNardo.”&nbsp; P 9.&nbsp;
              www.detailshere.com/nibiru.htm.]&nbsp; <br>
              <br>
              2004: It was this year that James McCanney announced on
              his Science Hour radio program that his senior military
              sources and his professional astronomical cantacts
              informed him that “a mini-solar system is moving into our
              solar system.&nbsp; This horde of incoming comets and
              asteroidsnow threaten all life on Earth.&nbsp; You are on
              your own!&nbsp; Be prepared!” In 2013 he would deny he
              said this. <br>
              <br>
              2006-2007: Various nations of the world have spent
              billions of dollars building both Earth-based and
              satellite-based infrared telescopes to track the Brown
              Dwarf/Planet X system from the December, 1997 launch of
              the International Concordia Explorer robotic telescope
              located at the Concordia Base in Antarctica –the Chandra

              the Spitzer telescope launched on August 25, 2003 in a
              unique trailing orbit around the Sun – the Pan-Starrs
              (Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System), a
              planned array of cameras and telescopes that began

              SOPHIA (Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy
              is a joint effort of NASA and the German Aerospace Center
              and began operation mounted on a 747 jumbo jet on May 26,
              2010. The Vatican was however, way ahead of all
              these.&nbsp; The Vatican has its own telescopes and
              observatories.&nbsp; Besides the official Vatican
              Observatory Faoundation located at Castel Gandolfo, Italy,
              there is the SILOE telescope sponsored by the Vatican,
              sent on a probe specifically to locate and track Planet
              X.&nbsp; It was built in Area 51 in 1990.&nbsp; <br>
              <br>
              Then there is the Vatican’s VATT (Vatican Advanced
              Technology Telescope located at the Mount Graham
              International Observatory in Arizona built specifically to
              track Planet X.&nbsp; It was built in 1993.&nbsp; In
              recent years another infrared telescope was set up called
              LUCIFER that the Vatican is also involved in.&nbsp;
              LUCIFER an acronym meaning Large binocular telescope
              near-infrared Utility with Camera and Integral Field unit
              for Extra-galactic Research.&nbsp; It was set up by
              astronomers from Germany, Italy, and the United States
              right next to the Vatican telescope on Mount Graham.It
              began operation in 2013.<br>
              <br>
              However, the discovery of Planet X in 1983 spurred the USA
              to build a special South Polar Telescope specifically to
              track the Brown Dwarf/Planet X system.&nbsp; Huge <br>
              sums of money were spent to build this massive South Pole
              Telescope in Antarctica.&nbsp; The first installation was
              the size of a mini-mall and required a massive C-130
              airlift effort to transport the pre-assembled modules and
              a large staff to the most desolate, inhospitable and
              inaccessible region in the world.&nbsp; This South Pole
              Telescope is far more powerful, capable and survivable
              than the 1983 IRAS spacecraft and the space-based Hubble
              telescope put together. <br>
              <br>
              The pristine sky of Antarctica is the best place on Earth
              to observe the Brown Dwarf/Planet X system incoming from
              the south below the ecliptic. This telescope began
              operation in January, 2007.<br>
              <br>
              2008: The first Brown Dwarf/Planet X system images were
              leaked and released through an anonymous informant at the
              South Pole Telescope in 2008.&nbsp; Marshall Masters <br>
              states, “On February 20, 2008, a 37 year old You Tube
              Director in Switzerland with the screen name of
              NibiruShock2012 posted images of Planet X that were
              allegedly taken by the South Pole Telescope (SPT) in
              Antarctica.&nbsp; Titled Nibiru/Planet X photos taken
              January 2008, it has been viewed 39,000 times as of the
              publication date of this article.” [“First Planet X/Nibiru
              Images Leaked by an Anonymous South Pole Telescope (SPT)
              Informant” by Marshall Masters.&nbsp; March 2008.]
              Marshall Masters states in his updates on this that “The
              first NibiruShock2012 video was very compelling and so we
              published a detailed analysis on the yowusa web
              site.&nbsp; This video was either genuine (we found that
              it could not be done with Photoshop) or a sophisticated
              hoax.”&nbsp; <br>
              <br>
              Then NibiruShock2012 posted another image video on March
              3, 2008.&nbsp; Marshall Masters was blocked from
              communicating with NibiruShock2012 by phone or via You
              Tube which is a bit suspicious.&nbsp; Then a third video
              was posted on March 10, 2008 declaring the first two
              posted videos of Planet X images a hoax.&nbsp; This third
              video was then taken down on March 12, 2008. <br>
              <br>
              From what Marshall Masters has been able to determine the
              last video posted appears to be a deliberate attempt to
              discredit authentic Planet X images by someone who <br>
              somehow co-opted and took over the NibiruShock2012 You
              Tube site.&nbsp; Later research revealed that Planet X
              images leaked from the South Pole Telescope were sent to
              someone in Switzerland who put into video format.&nbsp; It
              was then sent from there to some undisclosed location in
              Europe that had the video put on the internet.&nbsp; So it
              took three individuals to accomplish the complete release
              of these Planet X images to the public.&nbsp; These and
              other images of Planet X have been released and attacked
              by internet trolls and other forces working for the
              Powers-That-Be.<br>
              <br>
              Marshall Masters and his Planet X research team at the
              Your Own World USA website along with the 00 Skyview team
              of amateur astronomers have brought together <br>
              considerable evidence on the Brown Dwarf/Planet X
              system.&nbsp; The Higher Truth Channel and various teams
              of astronomers both professional and amateur have
              unearthed considerable data and information on the
              incoming Brown Dwarf/Planet X system. Scientists have
              noted “swarms” of comets, asteroids etc. all coming from
              one direction –Aquarius (the Brown Dwarf/Planet X system
              has been tracked moving from the constellation Aquilla to
              the constellation Opuchus). These astronomical scientists
              <br>
              worked in pairs and they began dying under mysterious
              circumstances in pairs... <br>

              A common link between these various teams of scientists

              concerning the origins and direction these swarms of
              comets were coming from – all from the direction the Brown

              <b>The EXISTENCE AND ARRIVAL of PLANET X</b><b><br>
              </b><br>
              Some of this information may rattle us a little, but we
              must know what tricks are being played on us.<br>
              <br>
              Let’s have a look at a few sources of Planet X information
              <br>
              <br>
              <b>&nbsp;*1 Zac Sitchin</b><b><br>
              </b><br>
              I have already said he gave 2078 as the arrival of Planet
              X.<br>
              <br>
              Here is a site that says Sitchin was WRONG, WRONG, WRONG!<br>
              <br>
              <a href="http://sitchiniswrong.com/nibiru/nibiru.htm"
                "><b>http://sitchiniswrong.com/nibiru/nibiru.htm</b></a><b><br>
              </b><br>
              <b>* 2 Carlos Ferrada</b><b><br>
              </b><br>
              He was wrong about the arrival of Planet X – see the video
              I post here:<br>
              <br>
              <a href="http://stateofthenation2012.com/?p=5462"
                "><b>http://stateofthenation2012.com/?p=5462</b></a><b><br>
              </b><br>
              In the video you will note Carlos Ferrada said Planet X
              would be 14 million km at its closest point to Earth in
              1999 (which was wrong!!!) and travelling at 92 km/sec.<br>
              <br>
              At around the 3 min mark you will learn that the velocity
              of heavenly bodies is NOT a constant. That is one of the
              problems we are having with pinpointing the possible
              location and time of arrival of Planet X to its nearest
              point to Earth.<br>
              <br>
              If you go to the video Part 2, which has no English
              subtitles, the arrival for Planet X was again given by
              Ferrada as August 1999!<br>
              <br>
              Of course this was wrong. Nothing happened.<br>

              <br>
              They both extol Zionism and its sources. So we know that

              If the Pleiadians told him the truth, why could they not
              tell him the Truth about the Holocaust,just like the Red
              Cross did with absolute figures? It is because he peddles
              in BS just as Billy Meier and the Pleiadians do! It is
              interesting to note that the Zetas, through Lieder, call
              Masters a liar!!<br>

              “Hercolubus or Red Planet” is a warning to Humanity about
              the proximity to Earth of the Planet Hercolubus. This is
              an enormous planet whose great gravitating power will
              provoke in our planet multiple earthquakes, tidal waves,
              volcanic eruptions, etc., that will be increasing in
              intensity until provoking the total destruction of this
              Humanity.<br>
              <br>
              In this book, V.M. Rabolú describes the catastrophic
              events that will happen soon to all of us, some of which
              we are already witnessing, and the necessary formula to
              escape from them.<br>
              <br>
              Along with the purpose and sense of this book, the
              non-profit Ediciones Humanidad (Honduras) is established;
              the sole activity being the diffusion of the book
              “Hercolubus or Red Planet” in the easiest and most
              accessible possible way for everyone.<br>
              <br>
              The book “Hercolubus or Red Planet” is an aid to Humanity
              so it can avoid its destruction due to the arrival of
              planet Hercolubus. Thus its sale is non-profit and does
              not serve to enrich anyone.<br>
              <br>
              Its author, V.M. Rabolú, has written this book renouncing
              to any kind of material profit from the same and therefore
              Ediciones Humanidad (Honduras) diffuses this book at a
              price cost without any extra benefit whatsoever.<br>
              <br>
              Likewise, Ediciones Humanidad does not edit any other book
              except this one, nor from any other authors, nor does
              reprinting of any other book. It only exclusively
              distributes “Hercolubus or Red Planet” by V.M. Rabolú.<br>

                <b> </b><br>
                I have written this book with great sacrifice, lying in
                bed unable to stand or to sit up. But seeing the need to
                warn Humanity of the coming catastrophe, I made a great
                effort. <br>
                <br>
                I dedicate this message to Humanity, as a last resort,
                because there is nothing else to do. <br>
                <br>

                <b>HERCOLUBUS OR RED PLANET </b><br>
                <b> </b><br>
                Humanity is spellbound by the predictions of those we
                falsely call scientists, who do nothing but fill
                Humanity with lies and distort the truth. We are going
                to talk about Hercolubus or Red Planet, which is
                approaching Earth. <br>
                <br>
                According to some accounts, scientists have even
                calculated its weight, and they say it is so many tonnes
                and has a certain diameter, as if it were a child’s toy,
                but this is not the case. Hercolubus or Red Planet is
                five or six times larger than Jupiter. It is a gigantic
                mass, which cannot be stopped or deflected. <br>
                <br>
                The Earth’s inhabitants regard it as a toy, but in fact
                it is the beginning of the end for the planet Earth. It
                is already here. The other worlds of our solar system
                know this and are making every effort to help us avoid
                this catastrophe. However, nobody will be able to stop
                it. This is the punishment we deserve, to put an end to
                so much evil. <br>
                <br>
                I state that Hercolubus is a creation like our world. It
                is inhabited by its own Humanity, which is as perverse
                as our own. Each planet, each world has its own
                Humanity. Scientists should not believe that they can
                attack and disintegrate Hercolubus. Its inhabitants also
                have weapons, which can retaliate and wipe us out
                instantly. If they are attacked, they will defend
                themselves and the end will come much more quickly. <br>
                <br>
                Within the coming and going of life, everything returns
                to its beginning or to its end. The same thing happened
                with less intensity on the continent of Atlantis.
                However, in this return of events our planet will not be
                able to bear the other planet passing very close without
                blowing to pieces. This is what the scientists are
                unaware of because they believe themselves to be very
                powerful with their weapons, capable of destroying this
                giant planet. They are very mistaken. <br>
                <br>
                What is going to happen in a short time is the
                destruction of the famous ‘Tower of Babel’ that they
                have built. They have already finished it and the
                negative consequences are now coming for the whole of
                Humanity. <br>
                <br>
                Scientists can deny this with their theories, as they
                are doing now and have done before, distorting the truth
                because of pride, conceit and ambition for power. They
                will laugh like braying donkeys, because they are not
                able to measure the consequences of what they have done.
                They have riddled the planet with nuclear bombs in order
                to control it without considering that God and his
                Justice exists and will crush everything. You cannot
                talk to beasts about God, because they bray and deny him
                through their actions. They believe they are gods, and
                they are not. <br>
                <br>
                The false, so-called powers that exist today will be
                devastated economically and morally. Money will
                disappear within a very short time. Hunger and poverty
                will put an end to them. They will not be able to endure
                a single jolt, and they will remain paralysed by fear
                and terror. Then they will truly realise that Divine
                Justice exists to punish evil. <br>
                <br>
                At present the whole world is busy looking for money at
                all costs. This is precisely what happened in Atlantis
                where the god of that time was money; religions
                portrayed it as a golden calf. <br>
                <br>
                Likewise in this age, money is the god, and this is
                totally wrong. <br>
                <br>
                The rich, who boast so much about power now, will be the
                most unfortunate, because having large sums of money
                will get hem nowhere when there is no-one to sell to or
                buy from. They will fall to their knees and cry begging
                for a plate of food, howling like dogs. <br>
                <br>
                When Hercolubus comes closer to the Earth and aligns
                with the Sun, deadly epidemics will begin to spread over
                the entire planet. Neither doctors nor official science
                will know what sort of illnesses they are or how to cure
                them. They will be powerless in the face of the
                epidemics. Life will begin to disappear from our planet.
                At that point, Humanity will have to eat the corpses of
                its fellow men and women because of the overwhelming
                hunger and unbearable heat. <br>
                <br>
                The moment of tragedy and darkness will come: tremors,
                earthquakes and tidal waves. Human beings will become
                mentally unbalanced, because they will not be able to
                eat or sleep. In the face of danger, they will throw
                themselves over the precipice en masse, completely mad.
                <br>
                <br>
                This race will disappear. No life will be left on the
                planet and the Earth will sink into the ocean. This is
                because Humanity has reached such a high level of
                depravity that now it even wants to pass on this evil to
                other planets. But this will not be allowed. <br>
                <br>
                Scientists and the whole world are full of panic even
                before the destruction has started. Yet, no-one on Earth
                has the fear of God within. They believe that they are
                lords and masters of life and that they are powerful.
                However, now they are going to see that there is indeed
                a Divine Justice that judges us according to our deeds.
                <br>
                <br>
                What I am affirming in this book is a prophecy that will
                be fulfilled very shortly, because I am certain about
                the end of the planet; I know it. I am not frightening,
                but warning, because I am distressed about this poor
                Humanity. These events will not be long in coming and
                there is no time to waste with illusory things. <br>
                <br>
                <b>NUCLEAR TESTS AND THE OCEAN </b><br>
                <b> </b><br>
                We are in a blind alley. <br>
                <br>
                We have already spoken about Hercolubus in a rather
                superficial way without going into much detail, so as
                not to scare or alarm people. We are going to see
                another fatal and destructive danger, which no one will
                be able to stop: the nuclear tests in the ocean. <br>
                <br>
                There are large, very deep cracks along the seabed,
                which are already making contact with the fire within
                the Earth. This is happening precisely because of
                nuclear tests that the scientists and powers -they
                believe themselves to be powers – are carrying out. They
                do not measure the consequences of the atrocities they
                have committed and continue committing against the
                planet and against Humanity. <br>
                <br>
                The fire within the Earth has already started to make
                contact with the water, and cyclones have started to
                appear. North Americans call it ‘The El Niño
                Phenomenon’. It is not ‘El Niño’, it is the contact
                between the fire within the Earth and the water, and
                this is spreading in the ocean. As cracks develop, tidal
                waves, earthquakes and frightening occurrences in water
                and on land will take place. There will not be a single
                coastal town that will not be devastated. Our planet
                will begin sinking into the ocean because the Earth’s
                axis has already been shifted due to all the tests that
                are being carried out. <br>
                <br>
                The Earth’s axis has already shifted from its position
                and through tremors, earthquakes and tidal waves it will
                become completely loose and then sink. Do not imagine,
                dear reader, that the planet will sink suddenly. This
                will be a long, slow, distressing and painful process,
                through which Humanity will have to go. It will sink
                piece by piece into the ocean until it reaches its end.
                <br>
                <br>
                Scientists do not measure the atrocities they have
                committed against Creation. They will be victims of
                their own inventions. There are already monsters -wild
                beasts -on the seabed, which have been feeding on
                nuclear energy. The increase in temperature of the water
                will make them come out and seek refuge. They will reach
                the coastal towns and devastate everything: houses,
                buildings, ships and people. These wild beasts, having
                developed from atomic energy are atomic. Thus,
                three-dimensional bullets will do nothing but make them
                more furious. What I am saying here will happen shortly.
                <br>
                <br>
                And it does not stop there. The boiling of the seawater
                caused by the Earth’s fire will cause an immense steam
                to rise; planes will not be able to fly and ships will
                not be able to navigate. This steam will cloud the sun,
                total darkness will come and life on our planet will
                come to an end. I advise you, dear reader, not to leave
                wherever you are, because there is nowhere to go. <br>
                <br>
                Scientists ignore all these consequences that they have
                provoked with their nuclear explosions and their tests
                in the ocean. Therefore, no matter how scientific they
                are, they are ignorant, wild beasts who do not care that
                they have invented devices to destroy Humanity and
                themselves. <br>
                <br>
                Nuclear energy has contaminated the whole sea and the
                animals living in it. It stands to reason that when we
                eat fish and other seafoods we are contaminating our
                bodies. It is better not to eat them. <br>
                <br>
                The sea breathes in and out because it is a living body.
                When exhaling, it contaminates the oxygen that we
                breathe, and all the vegetation. Changes in the human
                organism will occur and monstrous children will be born
                caused by this general contamination, alarming the whole
                world. <br>
                <br>
                When looking at our planet from other superior
                dimensions, you can see it has already disappeared. What
                we can see is a yellow coloured mudhole, as if you were
                boiling a bit of soil with water in a pot. You see no
                life at all of any kind -plant, animal or human.
                Everything is dead. All that is needed is for this to
                crystallise in the Third Dimension or the physical world
                so that it begins to vanish from the face of the Earth,
                as everything comes from above to below. <br>
                <br>
                The scientists and the intellectuals will laugh at the
                top of their voices like braying donkeys at what I am
                saying here, but when the moment comes, they will be the
                most cowardly. They will cry without knowing what to do
                or where to go. <br>
                <br>
                Well, what do we expect from Humanity? We expect its
                end. Those who falsely call themselves scientists are
                certainly scientists, but destructive, not constructive
                ones. They are using science to destroy everything that
                has life. <br>
                <br>
                I am asking the scientists, the ones who are braying so
                loudly: what formula can you find to avoid these
                problems that are threatening to destroy Humanity and
                this planet? There is no formula other than to await the
                catastrophe. Or, if you have an effective formula, could
                you let us know what it is? <br>
                <br>
                <b>EXTRATERRESTRIALS </b><br>
                <b> </b><br>
                I have seen films and magazines by North Americans,
                trying to block out the light of the sun with one
                finger, but they are mistaken. They will not blur my
                vision and still less will they make me believe in their
                stupid theories and base imaginings, as they are doing
                with Humanity. <br>
                <br>
                Just as they are doing with Hercolubus, which is rapidly
                approaching Earth, by playing it down (in that they even
                dare to state its weight and mass) so they have done
                with extraterrestrials by distorting them as gorillas or
                animals. This is a great lie, one hundred percent false,
                because the inhabitants of other planets in our solar
                system and galaxy are superior humans and wise beings. <br>
                <br>
                I have had contact with extraterrestrials many times. I
                have been to Venus and Mars by consciously travelling in
                my Astral Body and can bear witness to these marvellous
                inhabitants. I cannot find words to describe their
                wisdom, their culture and the angelic life that they
                live. <br>
                <br>
                <b>Life on Venus </b><br>
                <br>
                The Venusians have perfect bodies: a broad forehead,
                blue eyes, straight nose, blond hair and an astonishing
                intelligence. They are more or less between 1.3 and <br>
                <br>
                1.4 metres (4’ 4” -4’ 6”) tall. Nobody is taller or
                shorter. There are no potbellies and you do not see
                deformed people. Everybody has an angelic figure. There
                is perfection in men and women because it is a planet
                with an ascendant, superior Humanity. There are no
                monsters like those you can see here. They wear wide
                belts full of red, blue and yellow buttons all around
                that flash like a lighthouse. If they are in danger,
                they press a master switch, like a buckle on a belt.
                Just by pressing it a circle of fire is formed which can
                destroy a bullet and everything that enters its
                vicinity. <br>
                <br>
                I also found out about a pocket manual weapon, the size
                of a cigarette pack. Just by pressing a button on the
                gadget, they could blow up a hill, however big it might
                be, and make it disappear. What would an inhabitant of
                the Earth do with a weapon like this? <br>
                <br>
                When you think of asking them a question they answer,
                without you needing to move your lips, in whichever
                language it may be, as they speak all languages
                perfectly. They have the Gift of Languages. <br>
                <br>
                When you are talking with a Venusian, the others carry
                on with their work and continue about their business
                without stopping. They are not like us, who crowd around
                and criticise a person who has a physical defect. I
                looked at myself on Venus, compared my shape with theirs
                and felt ashamed; I looked like a gorilla. However,
                nobody is struck by that, everybody passes by with no
                curiosity or surprise. It is a culture the likes of
                which one has never seen. <br>
                <br>
                Now I am going to describe their earth, nature, way of
                life and how they work. <br>
                <br>
                The soil on Venus is not compact or heavy like ours, but
                light and soft. As for stones, we might imagine them to
                be like those on our planet but they are not. There are
                all sorts of stones, big and small, but they do not have
                the same weight as they would here. They are not dense:
                you could lift a stone that would weigh several pounds
                here, and there it weighs just ounces, almost nothing,
                because it is light and made from soft materials. <br>
                <br>
                The trees are not huge, the vegetation has no thorns and
                there are no vines in the mountains blocking the way.
                You can make your way through one of those mountains
                without necessarily taking a machete or a knife because
                there is nothing to cut. There is no danger from
                anywhere. <br>
                <br>
                Fruit trees are even planted on the flat roofs of houses
                in pots and with good fertilised soil, so that they bear
                fruit. There, nobody takes a piece of fruit simply
                because they feel like doing so, but they wait until it
                is ripe and in season. They harvest with a device,
                without touching the fruit with their hands, and it goes
                through tubes to revolving tanks of very pure water
                where it goes through a special cleaning process. After
                the fruit has been cleaned it goes through another tube
                to machines where it is pulverised. From there it goes
                to another container where more vitamins are added, not
                chemical vitamins, but natural ones, and then it is
                sealed hermetically. This is one of their foods. <br>
                <br>
                Regarding the sea, people will tend to compare ours with
                theirs but in fact their sea is perfectly blue, like a
                calm lagoon. There is no movement in any direction, or
                waves, so that you can see into the depths without any
                artificial device. <br>
                <br>
                Fish are extremely tame, they are not afraid of anyone.
                There are areas in the sea where fish are fed with lots
                of vitamins. When they need to eat some they look to see
                which ones are the biggest or which ones they want to
                use. They carefully lay out a net without damaging or
                frightening the other fish, and then take them out and
                gut them. <br>
                <br>
                Next, by means of some pulleys the fish go into a tank
                with very pure water circulating, and they go through a
                special cleaning. This happens without handling them.
                From there they go to machines, where the fish are
                pulverised and more natural vitamins are added. This is
                another of their foods. The same is done with
                vegetables. Nobody eats meat of any kind there. <br>
                <br>
                There are places where they go and sit at a table, let
                us say like restaurants, so that the reader understands
                better. Since all the inhabitants read thoughts, it is
                not necessary to order the dish you would like to have.
                The dish arrives without you moving your lips. They do
                not express thanks or other similar things that we do
                here. Once you have eaten you stand up from the table
                and you do not have to ask how much it costs, how much
                you owe, or say thanks, because everyone expresses
                thanks with a movement of the head. <br>
                <br>
                The same thing happens with the clothes shops. When they
                want to change, they go into a shop and immediately
                receive clothes and shoes. Right there they can press a
                switch on the wall and a dark room forms, where they can
                change and bathe if they like. By pressing another
                switch a jet of water flows out. Afterwards they hand
                over the clothing they have just removed so that it can
                be cleaned specially. There are no differences in
                clothes or shoes. They are standard for everybody. <br>
                <br>
                Nobody owns a house there. When a Venusian couple is
                tired or wants to rest, they press a switch on a house
                or a building, where a dark room is formed. They press
                another switch and a bed appears. There is no need to
                say ‘that is mine’, rather it belongs to whoever needs
                it, without asking anybody for permission. <br>
                <br>
                The streets on Venus are not like ours. There the
                avenues move like a conveyor belt. There are no
                accidents of any kind because everything is orderly. The
                vehicles are very beautiful, richly decorated platforms.
                They depart, reach their destination and the platform
                descends with all the people on it. It is not the people
                who get down but the platform that lowers. Then another
                platform goes up, which is already loaded with other
                people, ready to continue its journey. The streets are
                powered with solar energy, as is every machine. Oil and
                petrol are not used, nor is anything that causes
                pollution. For that reason there is no pollution.<br>
                <br>
                To build houses they do not go up as we do here, where
                you have to climb several metres high to work. Everybody
                works from the ground. The roof of the building is the
                first thing they assemble, then they lift this structure
                by means of rollers and continue building the next
                floor. When it is ready, they lift it again with the
                rollers and so on, according to the number of floors
                they want to build, without risking accidents. <br>
                <br>
                Venusian men and women work two hours daily, all at
                their profession. Money does not exist there and nobody
                owns anything. Everybody has the right to everything and
                works for everyone. There is no Mr so-and-so or Sir
                so-and-so, because there is equality. The law is to work
                two hours daily, so that hunger and poverty do not
                exist. <br>
                <br>
                By using their powers and faculties they control nature.
                When they choose, they make it rain, they make the sun
                shine or they cloud over the sky. It is not as it is
                with us, where we are under Nature’s power. <br>
                <br>
                There are no permits like ‘I need permission to travel
                to another planet,’ no. There, every Venusian can take a
                spaceship from the station where they are kept, to
                travel where they wish, be it to another planet or other
                galaxies, without asking anybody. There is total freedom
                with the proviso that, when they return, they leave the
                spaceship where they found it, so that someone else can
                use it. There are no borders and no red tape. <br>
                <br>
                I can tell you that on Venus there are no families like
                on our planet; there are only couples. They do not have
                either churches or priests to marry them. They unite
                with their twin souls or their better halves, as they
                are called, who complement all human beings. There are
                no religions of any kind. The religion is the mutual
                respect towards life and others. <br>
                <br>
                There is no fornication as there is here, because
                Earth’s inhabitants are worse than beasts. There they
                use what Gnosis teaches: Scientific Chastity or
                Transmutation of the Energies. That is why they prolong
                their lives as they wish, because the energy is one’s
                own life. By contrast, on our planet young people look
                old because of fornication. <br>
                <br>
                When you shake hands with them, you feel an electrical
                current that shakes you as if you were receiving energy,
                because they are full of energy. They are not
                fornicators, as we are here. That energy is the energy
                of Scientific Chastity. <br>
                <br>
                They unite sexually to have children without
                fornication. One sperm that escapes is enough to create
                a physical body for a soul who wants to come to learn.
                There is no sexual degeneration as there is here, where
                priests are even marrying homosexuals. Homosexuality
                does not exist there. They are real men and real women.
                Sexual outrages are only seen on our planet, because on
                the other planets they know how to reproduce without
                falling into fornication. <br>
                <br>
                When a child is born he is transferred to a clinic with
                full care where he gets special food, until he is old
                enough to study. When he is old enough to begin his
                education he goes to a school, which is a huge workshop,
                where he learns all the essentials he needs to know
                through practice. In order to study the vocation that
                this soul carries within, the directors of those schools
                teach him how to use machinery and let him develop his
                own ideas. <br>
                <br>
                When a child has an idea to produce something, the
                teachers help the child to complete it until he makes
                the mechanism he wants. They do so one by one with the
                whole of Humanity, so on Venus nobody is ignorant and
                everyone is prepared for the material and the spiritual
                ascent. <br>
                <br>
                <b>Life on Mars </b><br>
                <b> </b><br>
                Life on Mars is exactly the same as on Venus. There is
                freedom in everything. The Martians can move to any
                place on the planet, without needing papers or passports
                or anything like that and without needing anyone’s
                permission. Wherever they go, there is an opportunity to
                eat, sleep and have a change of clothes. Everywhere on
                Mars, wherever they may be, they find everything they
                need, because there are no <br>
                borders and, instead, complete freedom. It is exactly
                the same way on the other planets in our solar system. <br>
                <br>
                Martians have stronger bodies than Venusians, visibly
                tougher, for they belong to the Ray of Strength. <br>
                <br>
                On Mars everybody wears a soldier’s uniform: shield,
                helmet and suit of armour. All these war clothes are
                made of a material similar to bronze. They stand out
                because they are warriors to the core, but not warriors
                as we would call here. There are no wars amongst them or
                with the other planets. Their war is against evil, to
                defeat evil, not against one other. <br>
                <br>
                I can tell you that on those planets nobody works using
                brute force as we do in our world. Nobody sweats. They
                do not exhaust themselves because there the machines do
                the work. They are all run by solar energy. Their work
                is to guide or operate the machines, relieving each
                other in shifts. Everything functions through their
                wisdom. <br>
                <br>
                The extraterrestrials are so powerful that they are
                born, grow up and die at will. When they are tired of
                having a physical body for so many years and want to
                change, they die and are laid in a hollow exactly their
                size, which is in a wall. A door is closed and a button
                is pressed. They become ashes in a matter of minutes. If
                they were not quite dead, then the button does not work
                and they are taken out to die completely. There are no
                cemeteries. The ashes are scattered by a tree or buried.
                Nobody cries because of a person’s death; death for them
                is a change of clothes, nothing else. <br>
                <br>
                In those worlds there is no involution in plants,
                animals, humans or planets. Everything is ascending. By
                contrast, here we are descending with everything
                including the planet, as the facts prove. There are no
                plagues there like flies, gnats or mosquitoes, which are
                harmful to health. Nor is there the threat of reptiles.
                <br>
                <br>
                On Mars and on the other planets it is the law to
                respect each other, life and everything. They respect
                the free will of each person. It is not the same as the
                inhabitants of the Earth, who want to control the world
                purely by means of bullets and threats. The North
                Americans are very mistaken in the films they release
                and magazines they publish. <br>
                <br>
                Thus, I have described Mars a little to show the North
                Americans that they do not know anything about life on
                other worlds, as they deny the existence of life on Mars
                and other planets. <br>
                <br>
                I do not use telescopes or anything artificial to know
                about the Universe. I know how to operate my inner
                bodies with complete will and consciousness. Gnosis gave
                me the keys. I put into practice what I was taught and
                the result was this: Knowing, for he who knows has
                Knowledge. He who does not have Knowledge talks of what
                he does not know. Gnosis in practice is beyond
                comparison; it overcomes all obstacles and barriers that
                may appear. <br>
                <br>
                <b>Interplanetary Spaceships </b><br>
                <b> </b><br>
                Let us talk a little about interplanetary spaceships.
                Scientists ignore them or call them into question, thus
                leading Humanity to doubt the existence of such ships. <br>
                <br>
                All interplanetary spaceships move with solar energy.
                They are made from a material which does not exist here
                and which is resistant to bullets and to everything.
                They are made in one piece and have no soldered joints
                or rivets. They are controlled by switches. <br>
                <br>
                They have two horizontal pipes made of a light material
                very similar to aluminium but shinier and stronger,
                which does not exist on this planet. These pipes run
                through the spacecraft from the front to the rear. At
                the front solar energy enters and at the back the burned
                energy comes out. These are the fiery tails that the
                ships leave behind as they fly. <br>
                <br>
                Not all of them are round, as there is also a long
                narrow model in the shape of a cigar, which can
                transport hundreds of people. Therefore, not all of them
                have the same shape and size. These are the transport
                vehicles of other planets. <br>
                <br>
                The crews of these spaceships communicate with each
                other telepathically, without telephones, television or
                using anything like that. They have all their faculties
                awakened. <br>
                <br>
                Any of those inhabitants of the Earth who boast so
                loudly, such as the Americans and the other powers, who
                believe themselves to be the only ones with knowledge:
                what are those poor ignorant people doing without really
                knowing the wonders that exist on other planets? <br>
                <br>
                The interplanetary spaceships of the extraterrestrials
                are ready and prepared to take off and to rescue all
                those people who work according to the formula that is
                given in this book. They know, so it is not necessary to
                call them because they know us inside out. When the time
                comes the rescue will take place in these ships. There
                are very few who will succeed, and we can count them on
                our fingers. This is because nobody wants to work and
                instead they intellectualise everything. The mind
                produces theories, as it is the ego itself bringing them
                out. What we need here is action: to begin once and for
                all the work we have to do. <br>
                <br>
                I am reporting this so that everybody can discover the
                truth once and for all: we are not the only inhabitants
                of our solar system and our galaxy. Instead, we are
                lowest ones. The countries that believe they are great
                powers think they know everything, but they are proving
                just the opposite with their actions. Through the
                atrocities they are carrying out against one another,
                the quality of our Humanity is proven. I do not swallow
                those stories that they are inventing because I know the
                truth. <br>
                <br>
                I am writing this book so that Humanity can see how the
                Americans and scientists have fooled them with sheer
                lies and threats. I will always stand by what I am
                saying, and if I have to die to stand by the truth, I
                will die. <br>
                <br>
                <b>THE DEATH </b><br>
                <b> </b><br>
                This chapter is given the esoteric title ’The Death’,
                because anyone who begins to disintegrate his defects
                starts to leave the circle in which the whole of
                Humanity sits. So when he is asked to commit a misdeed,
                others say: ‘He is useless, he might as well be dead,’
                because he does not follow the rest of Humanity. <br>
                <br>
                Every human being carries a Divine Spark within, called
                the Soul, Buddhata or Essence. Well, it has various
                names, but in reality it is a Divine Spark that
                motivates us and gives us strength to begin spiritual
                work, such as that I am teaching you here. This Essence
                or Soul is trapped in all our wickedness, defects or
                psychological selves, which are called esoterically
                ‘Ego’. They do not allow the Essence to express <br>
                itself freely, because it is they who take over the
                voice and command of a person. <br>
                <br>
                But through the work of the disintegration of the
                defects the Essence grows, becomes stronger, and
                manifests itself with more clarity and with more
                strength. It is gradually transformed into Soul. <br>
                <br>
                I will give you an example. This tree is supported by
                its main roots; they do not feed it, but only support
                its weight and hold it up against the wind so that it
                does not fall down or collapse. Its tiny roots are the
                ones that spread along the surface of the soil and
                absorb sap to nourish it. <br>
                <br>
                Such is our Ego and that of Humanity: the thick roots,
                which hold up the tree, symbolise the main defects like
                lust, revenge, anger, pride and many others. And the
                small roots represent the details: those tiny
                manifestations that belong to such and such a defect,
                which we do not see as a defect but in fact they nourish
                it. The ego is fed by all these tiny small details, of
                which we have a large number. <br>
                <br>
                We must begin to observe ourselves, to see the thousands
                and thousands of negative details that we have, which
                sustain the trunk. Everybody who wants to be saved from
                the coming disaster needs to act in this way, to get
                down to taking the nourishment away from the tree, which
                are the tiny small roots. Negative details like bad
                thoughts, hatred, envy we feel towards other people,
                ambition, greed, pinching coins and insignificant
                things, telling lies, speaking while full of pride
                -well, all these things which are basically negative are
                what we must start to disintegrate in a serious way. <br>
                <br>
                There is another Divine Spark within us, called the
                Divine Mother. Her task is to disintegrate the defects
                with a lance she has. However small the detail may be,
                you need to ask the inner DIVINE MOTHER: “My Mother,
                pull this defect out of me and disintegrate it with your
                lance”. She will do so, because it is her task to help
                us in this manner so that we can liberate ourselves. In
                this way the tree will stop growing. Instead, it will
                get undernourished and it will wilt. <br>
                <br>
                What I am teaching here is to be put into practice, into
                action. Wherever you go, whether you are working or
                whatever you are doing, you need to pay attention to the
                mind, the heart and the sexual centre. These are the
                three centres where every defect manifests itself. When
                an element is manifesting, through any one of these
                three centres, the petition to the Divine Mother must
                follow immediately, so that she <br>
                can disintegrate it. <br>
                <br>
                Through this work of the death of the ego that I am
                explaining, we gain Scientific Chastity and we learn to
                love Humanity. Anyone who does not work upon the
                disintegration of the defects, can never reach Chastity
                and can never reach the point of feeling love for
                others, because he does not love himself. <br>
                <br>
                The disintegration of the defects and the astral
                projection are the ONLY FORMULAS we have to be rescued.

                <b>ASTRAL PROJECTION </b><br>
                <b> </b><br>
                Dear Reader: <br>
                <br>
                As we speak about the astral, I want to ask you whether
                you have dreamed about people who passed away years ago,
                about places and people you do not know physically. This
                is what people normally call dreams: “Last night I
                dreamt such a thing”. However, nobody stops to think
                about why they have dreamed about other regions or
                places while the physical body was resting in bed. <br>
                <br>
                This is the Astral Plane or Fifth Dimension, where
                neither weight nor distances exist, and to which the
                Astral Body belongs. This is a body exactly like the
                physical, but made of energy, which moves at great speed
                like a thought and is able to investigate anything we
                like in the Universe. <br>
                <br>
                In the Fifth Dimension we move and explore, and we know
                what the Angels, the Virgin and all the Hierarchies are;
                they move, speak and teach a Wisdom that is not written
                in books and is beyond the human mind. When you want to
                know for yourself what it is that people call Occultism,
                the Fifth Dimension is where you can know it, and then
                it stops being occult. <br>
                <br>
                The important thing is not to leave the physical body
                unconsciously, asleep, but to leave it consciously and
                move completely at will. My dearest reader, if you are
                going to put into practice the astral projection, I will
                give you mantras that I have used and I know they give
                positive results. A mantra is a magic word that allows
                us to leave the physical body and return to it, fully
                conscious. <br>
                <br>
                You lie down, relax your body and say the magic word
                three or five times verbally. Then you continue by
                repeating it mentally. When you feel that a current is
                running through your whole body from your feet to your
                head, as if you were losing strength, and you feel a
                lethargy so that you do not want to move, you must rise
                with extreme care without disturbance, get up, do a
                little jump and at once you will float. <br>
                <br>
                Do not be afraid, surprised or overjoyed when you see
                that you are floating with the astral body: all human
                beings do it and nothing has happened to them. It is
                only that they leave unconsciously and do not act at
                will. <br>
                <br>
                We all have our Divine Spirit, called the Father. As
                soon as you see that you are floating in the air, say:
                “My Father, take me to the Gnostic Church” or to
                wherever you want to go or wish to know, and he will
                take you there immediately, as fast as lightning. There,
                you will receive the teachings directly from the
                Hierarchies. <br>
                <br>
                In this way you are beginning to gain the true Wisdom,
                which is neither written in books nor taught in
                universities or anywhere. Hopefully you will do it every
                night. <br>
                <br>
                Mantra LA RA S -this mantra is pronounced so that the
                sound of each syllable is prolonged: <br>
                <br>
                Lllllaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa <br>
                Rrrrrrrrrraaaaaaaaaaaaaaa (rolling the ‘r’) <br>
                Ssssssssssssssssssssssssss (like a hiss) <br>
                <br>
                Another mantra for projecting with the astral body is FA
                RA ON <br>
                <br>
                Fffffaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa <br>
                Rrrrrrrrraaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa (rolling the ‘r’) <br>
                Ooooooooonnnnnnnnnn <br>
                <br>
                I am going to give you another key to awaken
                consciousness in the higher dimensions: <br>
                <br>
                Everything we see here around us -- houses, people, cars
                -- has a double, which is the astral. If you want to
                discern where you are, whether you are in the physical
                or in the astral, look at everything that is around you
                -people, houses, the place -- and ask yourself the
                question: “Why am I seeing this or that?” with wonder.
                “Am I in the astral body or in the physical body?” And
                you take a little jump with the intention of floating. <br>
                <br>
                It is not necessary for you to jump a whole metre: just
                by lifting yourself a few centimetres from the ground
                you already know whether you are there physically or
                not. If you do not float it is because you are in the
                physical, but if you float it is because you are in the
                astral body. Then, when you notice that you are
                floating, you need to ask the Inner Father immediately
                to take you to the Gnostic Church or to a place you
                would like to know about. <br>
                <br>
                Do it daily, as often as you can do it during the day,
                while you are working or wherever you are, and you will
                see the results. <br>
                <br>
                I stand by what I have written in this book, because I
                know it to be true. I am sure about what I say because I
                have investigated thoroughly with my astral body, which
                allows me to know about everything in great detail. <br>
                <br>
                <b>CONCLUDING REMARKS </b><br>
                <b> </b><br>
                I am giving these formulas to Humanity because those who
                really want to be saved from the forthcoming catastrophe
                must start immediately to disintegrate the psychological
                self, that means all our defects, which number
                thousands. They need to prepare themselves, so that at
                the time of the rescue they are taken to a safe place,
                where nothing will happen to them and where they can
                continue working on themselves until they reach
                Liberation. These people will manage to escape the
                disaster. <br>
                <br>
                The Divine Justice describes this Humanity as “the lost
                harvest”. That means that nothing can be done. The
                forthcoming destruction is happening because the Gods
                can do nothing more for us. Therefore, nobody will
                surprise the Hierarchies; everything is planned. <br>
                <br>
                Dear reader: I am speaking very clearly so that you
                understand the need to start working seriously. Whoever
                is working will be rescued from the danger. This is not
                for you to make up theories or hold discussions, but to
                experience the true teaching that I am giving in this
                book. We can resort to nothing else. <br>
                <br>
                I am not a fear-monger, I am a human being warning of
                what is to come and what will happen. What I am saying
                to you is very serious. Whoever is afraid of God begins
                to&nbsp; work against the defects, which are separating
                us from the Father. <br>
                <br>
                I could write more about the esoteric part. However, I
                do not want to take your time but rather to fight for
                each one to carry out this work that I am teaching. This
                is the&nbsp; way to follow and I do not want anyone to
                get lost. <br>

              </b><br>
              Jimi: "I'm not going to say it until a wider range of
              people see it. It's a universal thought; it's not a black
              or white thing, or a green and gold thing…There are a few
              chosen people that are here to help to get these people
              out of this certain sleepiness that they're in…All they're
              doing is making themselves weaker and weaker until their
              negatives [asteroids] come and just take them away, and
              that's what's gonna happen, then you're going to have no
              world to live on. The establishment's going to crumble
              away…The solar system is going through a change soon and
              it's going to affect the Earth itself. This room is just a
              crumb from the crust of the pie, and like there's no
              moving from any one land to another to save yourself in
              that respect…There's a physical change coming soon, it's
              neither bad or good - it's just true. The world's gonna go
              like topsy-turvy soon, because humans forget that they're
              part of earth-matter too, and so they have bad vibrations
              floatin' around now, so there's gonna be a big physical
              change…since the people are part of Earth, they're going
              to feel it too. In many ways they're a lot of the reason
              for causing it…The axis of the Earth turns around and
              changes the face of the world and completely different
              civilizations come about, or another age comes about. In
              other words, it changes the face of the Earth and it only
              takes about a quarter of a day…The axis of the Earth, if
              it changes, it changes the whole face of the Earth, like
              every few thousand years, so that new civilizations come
              every time it changes…The solar system is going through a
              change soon and it's going to affect the Earth in about
              thirty years. So I think a person should try to get his
              own thing, he should get a certain faith with one link.
              There's no whole lot of religions, just one link, because
              there's only a few chosen people that supposedly are to
              get this across."<br>

              <br>
              The following is the prophecy of Peter Deunov which
              regards the end of our civilization as we know it and the
              beginning of the Golden Age on Earth.<br>
              <br>
              Also known under the spiritual name of Beinsa Douno, the
              Bulgarian Master Peter Deunov (1864-1944) was a being of a
              very high level of consciousness, at the same time an
              incomparable musician, that gave during his whole life an
              example of purity, wisdom, intelligence and creativity.
              For years he was established close to Sofia where he lived
              surrounded by numerous disciples, he, by his radiance
              awakened the spirituality of thousands of souls in
              Bulgaria as well as the rest of Europe.<br>
              <br>
              Some days before his departure to the other world, he was
              in a profound mediumistic trance, he made an extraordinary
              prophecy in regards to our troubled epoch that we are
              crossing today, a prophecy about the “end of time” and the
              coming of a new Golden Age of humanity.<br>
              <br>
              Here is this deeply moving testament. It is current and so
              vibrant that one doubts that these words were spoken over
              70 years ago.<br>
              <br>
              “During the passage of time, the consciousness of man
              traversed a very long period of obscurity. This phase
              which the Hindus call “Kali Yuga“, is on the verge of
              ending. We find ourselves today at the frontier between
              two epochs: that of Kali Yuga and that of the New Era that
              we are entering.<br>
              <br>
              A gradual improvement is already occurring in the
              thoughts, sentiments and acts of humans, but everybody
              will soon be subjugated to divine Fire, that will purify
              and prepare them in regards to the New Era. Thus man will
              raise himself to a superior degree of consciousness,
              indispensable to his entrance to the New Life. That is
              what one understands by “Ascension“.<br>
              <br>
              Some decades will pass before this Fire will come, that
              will transform the world by bringing it a new moral. This
              immense wave comes from cosmic space and will inundate the
              entire earth. All those that attempt to oppose it will be
              carried off and transferred elsewhere.<br>
              <br>
              Although the inhabitants of this planet do not all find
              themselves at the same degree of evolution, the new wave
              will be felt by each one of us. And this transformation
              will not only touch the Earth, but the ensemble of the
              entire Cosmos.<br>
              <br>
              The best and only thing that man can do now is to turn
              towards God and improve himself consciously, to elevate
              his vibratory level, so as to find himself in harmony with
              the powerful wave that will soon submerge him.<br>
              <br>
              The Fire of which I speak, that accompanies the new
              conditions offered to our planet, will rejuvenate, purify,
              reconstruct everything: the matter will be refined, your
              hearts will be liberated from anguish, troubles,
              incertitude, and they will become luminous; everything
              will be improved, elevated; the thoughts, sentiments and
              negative acts will be consumed and destroyed.<br>
              <br>
              Your present life is a slavery, a heavy prison. Understand
              your situation and liberate yourself from it. I tell you
              this: exit from your prison! It is really sorry to see so
              much misleading, so much suffering, so much incapacity to
              understand where one’s true happiness lies.<br>
              <br>
              Everything that is around you will soon collapse and
              disappear. Nothing will be left of this civilization nor
              its perversity; the entire earth will be shaken and no
              trace will be left of this erroneous culture that
              maintains men under the yoke of ignorance.&nbsp;
              Earthquakes are not only mechanical phenomena, their goal
              is also to awaken the intellect and the heart of humans,
              so that they liberate themselves from their errors and
              their follies and that they understand that they are not
              the only ones in the universe.<br>
              <br>
              Our solar system is now traversing a region of the Cosmos
              where a constellation that was destroyed left its mark,
              its dust. This crossing of a contaminated space is a
              source of poisoning, not only for the inhabitants of the
              earth, but for all the inhabitants of the other planets of
              our galaxy. Only the suns are not affected by the
              influence of this hostile environment. This region is
              called “the thirteenth zone”; one also calls it “the zone
              of contradictions”. Our planet was enclosed in this region
              for thousands of years, but finally we are approaching the
              exit of this space of darkness and we are on the point of
              attaining a more spiritual region, where more evolved
              beings live.<br>
              <br>
              The earth is now following an ascending movement and
              everyone should force themselves to harmonize with the
              currents of the ascension. Those who refuse to subjugate
              themselves to this orientation will lose the advantage of
              good conditions that are offered in the future to elevate
              themselves. They will remain behind in evolution and must
              wait tens of millions of years for the coming of a new
              ascending wave.<br>
              <br>
              The earth, the solar system, the universe, all are being
              put in a new direction under the impulsion of Love. Most
              of you still consider Love as a derisory force, but in
              reality, it is the greatest of all forces! Money and power
              continue to be venerated as if the course of your life
              depended upon it. In the future, all will be subjugated to
              Love and all will serve it. But it is through suffering
              and difficulties that the consciousness of man will be
              awakened.<br>
              <br>
              The terrible predictions of the prophet Daniel written in
              the bible relate to the epoch that is opening. There will
              be floods, hurricanes, gigantic fires and earthquakes that
              will sweep away everything. Blood will flow in abundance.
              There will be revolutions; terrible explosions will
              resound in numerous regions of the earth. There where
              there is earth, water will come, and there where there is
              water, earth will come. God is Love; yet we are dealing
              here with a chastisement, a reply by Nature against the
              crimes perpetrated by man since the night of time against
              his Mother; the Earth.<br>
              <br>
              After these sufferings, those that will be saved, the
              elite, will know the Golden Age, harmony and unlimited
              beauty. Thus keep your peace and your faith when the time
              comes for suffering and terror, because it is written that
              not a hair will fall from the head of the just. Don’t be
              discouraged, simply follow your work of personal
              perfection.<br>
              <br>
              You have no idea of the grandiose future that awaits you.
              A New Earth will soon see day. In a few decades the work
              will be less exacting, and each one will have the time to
              consecrate spiritual, intellectual and artistic
              activities. The question of rapport between man and woman
              will be finally resolved in harmony; each one having the
              possibility of following their aspirations. The relations
              of couples will be founded on reciprocal respect and
              esteem. Humans will voyage through the different planes of
              space and breakthrough intergalactic space. They will
              study their functioning and will rapidly be able to know
              the Divine World, to fusion with the Head of the Universe.<br>
              <br>
              The New Era is that of the sixth race. Your predestination
              is to prepare yourself for it, to welcome it and to live
              it. The sixth race will build itself around the idea of
              Fraternity. There will be no more conflicts of personal
              interests; the single aspiration of each one will be to
              conform himself to the Law of Love. The sixth race will be
              that of Love. A new continent will be formed for it. It
              will emerge from the Pacific, so that the Most High can
              finally establish His place on this planet.<b><br>

              </div>
              <b> </b><br>
              The founders of this new civilization, I call them
              “Brothers of Humanity” or also “Children of Love” They
              will be unshakeable for the good and they will represent a
              new type of men. Men will form a family, as a large body,
              and each people will represent an organ in this body. In
              the new race, Love will manifest in such a perfect manner,
              that today’s man can only have a very vague idea.<br>
              <br>
              The earth will remain a terrain favorable to struggle, but
              the forces of darkness will retreat and the earth will be
              liberated from them. Humans seeing that there is no other
              path will engage themselves to the path of the New Life,
              that of salvation. In their senseless pride, some will, to
              the end hope to continue on earth a life that the Divine
              Order condemns, but each one will finish by understanding
              that the direction of the world doesn’t belong to them.<br>
              <br>
              A new culture will see the light of day, it will rest on
              three principal foundations: the elevation of woman, the
              elevation of the meek and humble, and the protection of
              the rights of man.<br>
              <br>
              The light, the good, and justice will triumph; it is just
              a question of time. The religions should be purified. Each
              contains a particle of the Teaching of the Masters of
              Light, but obscured by the incessant supply of human
              deviation. All the believers will have to unite and to put
              themselves in agreement with one principal, that of
              placing Love as the base of all belief, whatever it may
              be. Love and Fraternity that is the common base!<br>
              <br>
              The earth will soon be swept by extraordinary rapid waves
              of Cosmic Electricity. A few decades from now, beings who
              are bad and lead others astray will not be able to support
              their intensity. They will thus be absorbed by Cosmic Fire
              that will consume the bad that they possess. Then they
              will repent because it is written that “each flesh shall
              glorify God”.<br>
              <br>
              Related article: Is This Nibiru, A Galactic Ring Of Fire,

              <br>
              Our mother, the earth, will get rid of men that don’t
              accept the New Life. She will reject them like damaged
              fruit. They will soon not be able to reincarnate on this
              planet; criminals included. Only those that possess Love
              in them will remain.<br>
              <br>
              There is not any place on earth that is not dirtied with
              human or animal blood; she must therefore submit to a
              purification. And it is for this that certain continents
              will be immersed while others will surface. Men do not
              suspect to what dangers they are menaced by. They continue
              to pursue futile objectives and to seek pleasure. On the
              contrary those of the sixth race will be conscious of the
              dignity of their role and respectful of each one’s
              liberty. They will nourish themselves exclusively from
              products of the vegetal realm. Their ideas will have the
              power to circulate freely as the air and light of our
              days.<br>
              <br>
              The words “If you are not born again.” apply to the sixth
              race. Read Chapter 60 of Isaiah it relates to the coming
              of the sixth race the Race of Love.<br>
              <br>
              After the Tribulations, men will cease to sin and will
              find again the path of virtue. The climate of our planet
              will be moderated everywhere and brutal variations will no
              longer exist. The air will once again become pure, the
              same for water. The parasites will disappear. Men will
              remember their previous incarnations and they will feel
              the pleasure of noticing that they are finally liberated
              from their previous condition.<br>
              <br>
              In the same manner that one gets rid of the parasites and
              dead leaves on the vine, so act the evolved Beings to
              prepare men to serve the God of Love. They give to them
              good conditions to grow and to develop themselves, and to
              those that want to listen to them, they say: “Do not be
              afraid! Still a little more time and everything will be
              all right; you are on the good path. May he that wants to
              enter in the New Culture study, consciously work and
              prepare.”<br>
              <br>
              Thanks to the idea of Fraternity, the earth will become a
              blessed place, and that will not wait. But before, great
              sufferings will be sent to awaken the consciousness. Sins
              accumulated for thousands of years must be redeemed. The
              ardent wave emanating from On High will contribute in
              liquidating the karma of peoples.<br>
              <br>
              The liberation can no longer be postponed. Humanity must
              prepare itself for great trials that are inescapable and
              are coming to bring an end to egoism.<br>
              <br>
              Under the earth, something extraordinary is preparing
              itself. A revolution that is grandiose and completely
              inconceivable will manifest itself soon in nature. God has
              decided to redress the earth, and He will do it!<br>
              <br>
              It is the end of an epoch; a new order will substitute the
              old, an order in which Love will reign on earth.”<br>

              Current PlanetoPhysical alterations of the Earth are
              becoming irreversible. Strong evidence exists that these
              transformations are being caused by highly charged
              material and energetic non-uniformity's in anisotropic
              interstellar space which have broken into the
              interplanetary area of our Solar System. This "donation"
              of energy is producing hybrid processes and excited energy
              states in all planets, as well as the Sun. Effects here on
              Earth are to be found in the acceleration of the magnetic
              pole shift, in the vertical and horizontal ozone content
              distribution, and in the increased frequency and magnitude
              of significant catastrophic climatic events. There is
              growing probability that we are moving into a rapid
              temperature instability period similar to the one that
              took place 10,000 years ago. The adaptive responses of the
              biosphere, and humanity, to these new conditions may lead
              to a total global revision of the range of species and
              life on Earth. It is only through a deep understanding of
              the fundamental changes taking place in the natural
              environment surrounding us that politicians, and citizens
              a like, will be able to achieve balance with the renewing
              flow of PlanetoPhysical states and processes.<br>

                  <small>Abstract</small></b><small> -- There is a
                  strong consensus that modern humans originated in
                  Africa and moved out to colonize the world
                  approximately 50 000 years ago. During the process of
                  expansion, variability was lost, creating a linear
                  gradient of decreasing diversity with increasing
                  distance from Africa. However, the exact way in which
                  this loss occurred remains somewhat unclear: did it
                  involve one, a few or a continuous series of
                  population bottlenecks? We addressed this by analysing
                  a large published dataset of 783 microsatellite loci
                  genotyped in 53 worldwide populations, using the
                  program ‘Bottleneck’. Immediately following a sharp
                  population decline, rare alleles are lost faster than
                  heterozygosity, creating a transient excess of
                  heterozygosity relative to allele number, a feature
                  that is used by Bottleneck to infer historical events.
                  We find evidence of two primary events, one ‘out of
                  Africa’ and one placed around the Bering Strait, where
                  an ancient land bridge allowed passage into the
                  Americas. These findings agree well with the regions
                  of the world where the largest founder events might
                  have been expected, but contrast with the apparently
                  smooth gradient of variability that is revealed when
                  current heterozygosity is plotted against distance
                  from Africa.<br>

              Application:<br>
              <br>
              Insert the Earth-Activator into the ground with a distance
              of 2 meters between each stick. The depth to which you put
              it in the ground is dependent on what you want to do with
              the field/lawn/meadow. For lawns and meadows an insertion
              depth of 10cm is recommended, and for crop fields we
              recommend a depth of 20-30cm so that the stick lies deep
              enough to avoid being dislodged during ploughing. If the
              ground is to be used to grow trees then a stick should be
              inserted next to each one to a depth of 10cm. It takes
              around 2-3 months before the effects of the
              Earth-Activator permeate all the soil.<br>
              <br>
              One stick (diameter: 1cm, length: approx. 20cm) has an
              area of effect of around 4 meters squared.<br>

              Water Saver&nbsp; stick save more than 60 % irrigation
              General:&nbsp; During the use of the bio energetic dry
              land stick - Water Saver (standard steel) a bio&nbsp;
              energetic effect&nbsp; change the floor bonding capacity
              of air humidity.&nbsp; How does the dry ground stick work
              ? The simple steel stick will make an oscillation in the
              earth. It will take 3 month and the&nbsp; earth will also
              oscillate. With this oscillation the air humidity which is
              everywhere present&nbsp; will differ in interaction with
              plants into the ground and will source the earth
              with&nbsp; humidity. This will save irrigation up to
              60%.&nbsp;&nbsp; Application:&nbsp; Place the dry land
              stick in a distance of 2m ( 6 ft) in the ground.<br>
              <br>
              <br>
              The depth of the stick depends on what you are planning to
              do with the acre, floor or&nbsp; ground you place the
              stick into. We recommend 10 cm (4 inch) for grass, 20cm (8
              inch)&nbsp; to 30cm (12 inch) for grounds you are going to
              plough. It approximately lasts&nbsp; 2 to 3&nbsp; months
              till the effect of the dry land stick&nbsp; has fully
              spread in&nbsp; the ground One steel stick (diameter: 0.4
              inch, length: 8 inch, weight: 5&nbsp; oz) effect for 40 sq
              ft&nbsp; (4m²).&nbsp;&nbsp; How does the dry floor stick
              work ? With our own development we can change micro Atomic
              structures to enable space&nbsp; energy to get a
              frequency.&nbsp; Water is all around us even so it cannot
              be necessarily seen. The air humidity is an&nbsp;
              indication of how much water is actually in the air.
              Clouds are practically the visible form&nbsp; of the
              humidity in air, millions of tiny water droplets
              condensing out of the air to form&nbsp; liquid
              water.&nbsp; With the use of the dry stick, the ground is
              now enabled to access the water in the air&nbsp; directly
              without having to "wait" for the water droplets to be
              build.&nbsp; It takes approximately 3 months for the
              ground to be fully adjusted to this new capability&nbsp;
              With this technology we are able to save 60% watering and
              sometimes up to 100%. As&nbsp; side effect the field
              studies showed also an improvement of ground
              quality.&nbsp;&nbsp; Application Draper Utah&nbsp; 84020
              USA&nbsp; This area is near the Rocky Mountains and
              the&nbsp; summer is always very dry and hot. The
              sprinkler&nbsp; must be active day and night to keep the
              grass&nbsp; green.&nbsp;&nbsp; 100 dry land sticks where
              placed in February 2008&nbsp; on an area&nbsp; of 400m²
              (100*4m²). The first test&nbsp; were done without water.
              Under this condition the&nbsp; lawn will be dry and yellow
              the next day. But with&nbsp; the dry land stick it was
              green over a week&nbsp; without any water ! After this
              irrigation was&nbsp; started again and reduced from 100%
              (24h a day)&nbsp; in steps of 10%. Under this dry
              conditions and the&nbsp; hot temperature it was possible
              to reduce 60%&nbsp; irrigation to keep the grass green and
              under good&nbsp; conditions. In the year 2009 the test in
              summer were done&nbsp; with 40% irrigation the whole dry
              period and the&nbsp; grass stayed the whole summer under
              very good&nbsp; conditions. The save of water was 60% ! In
              times&nbsp; with yearly less water this is a very
              good&nbsp; investment.&nbsp;&nbsp; Situation 2011:&nbsp;
              Here is the part of the grass where I use the&nbsp;
              sprinkler in summer every day.&nbsp;&nbsp; For this part I
              use the dry ground sticks and you&nbsp; can also see the
              difference in the color. The&nbsp;&nbsp; grass has a
              darker green.&nbsp; In the 3rd year the water saving
              increased from&nbsp; 60% to 97% ! It is unbelievable but
              it is true&nbsp; David Scott Scott Dixon Inc 12216 South
              1950 East Draper Utah 84020 USA Application in Iraq:&nbsp;
              On a test area of 8000 m², the rods every 2 meters by 2
              meters were placed in a matrix&nbsp; about 10 cm below the
              surface and after a conditioning period of 3 months
              the&nbsp; start with&nbsp; irrigation experiments of 50%
              less water compared&nbsp; to a field should be done. But
              it was the&nbsp; unbelievable.&nbsp; After two months has
              grown the&nbsp; grass on the dry bare soil without water .
              The&nbsp; word has spread to the Ministry of
              Agriculture.&nbsp;&nbsp; For this reason, comes a
              delegation of the&nbsp; Kurdistan Regional Government,
              reporting directly&nbsp; to the Prime Minister to be
              explained the Austrian&nbsp; technology closer and gave
              the compay NG an&nbsp; environtment award for the product.
              Especially for&nbsp; dry areas, such as in Iraq, this
              development could&nbsp; help save a lot of water. Orders
              will following this&nbsp; year.&nbsp; further Application
              Sulaymaniya:&nbsp; After 1 month of placing the dry floors
              sticks, a first improvement is seen in the growth&nbsp; of
              grass without water. Another compare after 3 month in an
              area without&nbsp; and with dry floor stick is shown on

              2013 To whom it may concern:&nbsp; My name is Hubertus von
              Drabich, currently resident in the UAE. Given that this
              country&nbsp; has been built in the desert; there is
              always a level of water shortage. Consequently, the&nbsp;
              government of the UAE decided (a few years back) to
              extract water from the Arabian&nbsp; Gulf. Though, this
              requires a lot of energy and high costs.&nbsp; About 6
              months ago, we came across the new "Watersaver-Sticks"
              (Erde-Staebe) and&nbsp; decided to test them right away.
              We are absolutely delighted to see the effects of
              these&nbsp; sticks. Just after two months, our lawn
              started growing much better (in particular during&nbsp;
              the summer months, where we have temperatures of up to 50
              degrees). In addition, our&nbsp; mandarin tree started to
              produce fruits for the first time in two years (please
              refer to the&nbsp; following pictures for further
              details).&nbsp; All in all, we can only highly recommend
              the Watersaver Sticks for trial areas.&nbsp; In case you
              have any questions. please do not hesitate to contact me
