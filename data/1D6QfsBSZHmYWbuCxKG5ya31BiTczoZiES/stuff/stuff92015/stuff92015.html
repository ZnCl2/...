      Black Goo (also intelligent oil, sentient oil and Grey Goo, German
      Meaning: Black goo) is on the one hand, the English term for dark
      brown deposits and fluids that are secreted by wine plants after
      infection with the fungal Phaeomoniella chlamydospora, on the
      other hand the name of a supposedly mysterious shale oil which is
      known from science fiction movies and be subordinated to the
      health-related miracle properties.<br>
      <br>
      In connection with fantastic claims and conspiracy theories on the
      Internet imprecise to be found by a mysterious on Earth "smart
      oil" talk that look like oil, but be able to change its shape and
      enclose things or people and hurt them inflict.<br>
      <br>
      A proposition in the pseudo-medicine Black Goo products numerous
      conspiracy theories and promotional legends are common,
      respectively, without giving more resilient documents or
      information to the inventor of the respective statement. So the
      appropriate oil should be abiotic origin, derived from space or
      alternatively only to be found on a small uninhabited and unnamed
      island in the "sub-Antarctic", which aims to alleged "Southern
      Thule islands" are (see Neuschwabenlandmythos). In slightly
      different form the theories of various authors and circles spread
      again. Thus aliens are said to have made on earth Black Goo and
      this fact has led to the emergence of the Falklands War.<br>

      <br>
      In the alternative medicine market various products related to
      Black Goo offered. These include shale oil as well as homeopathy
      globules known, the "marked" were "informed" or by radionics
      process.<br>
      <br>
      Claims to miracle properties of Black-Goo-products play a role in
      the scene of the trailer Morgellonen hypothesis. On Black Goo
      including the pseudo scientist Harald Kautz-Vella drew attention,
      believes in the chemtrail conspiracy theory and this brings in
      connection with the alleged Morgellonen. He founded a "Consortium
      for Morgellon-related Research" called "time loop" and believes
      that produced by Radionics Black Goo products effective against
      the disease are Morgellonen invention.<br>
      <br>
      The assertions and inventions of Kautz-Vella offered Jo Conrad on
      1 May 2014, his advertising project Bewusst.TV a stage. He
      presented there Kautz-Vella under the title "About Transhumanism
      religion of the elites and black oil-entities" in front. [2] In an
      interview with Conrad Kautz-Vella described his globules as "a
      kind of antidote" and "a homeopathic remedy, what connects us to
      the collective consciousness. " The esoteric magazine space and
      time reported in 2014 also on Black Goo, Morgellonen, Chemtrails
      and Kautz-Vella. [3] Michael Vogt also interviewed Kautz-Vella at
      Quer-Denken.TV to Black Goo and the alleged miracle properties of
      the oil, about the existence of a soul of oil [4] (see also
      transhumanism and Gaia hypothesis on the existence of a soul in
      animals and objects).<br>

      <b>Black Goo in science fiction</b><br>
      <br>
      A Black-Goo-liquid plays a role in several science fiction films
      and film series:<br>
      <br>
      As a result, "the black soul" of the next-generation season of the
      series Star Trek device the crew of the Enterprise to a being
      whose consistency is described as oleaginous. It can change its
      shape and is able to enclose the crew members. The essence was
      called "black soul", because it had never known what love is.<br>

      Conspiracy to Black Goo and the emergence of the Falklands War<br>
      David Griffin (Picture: YouTube)<br>
      Bernhard Wimmer [5]<br>
      <br>
      One of the first versions of a conspiracy theory about
      Black-Goo-oil and the emergence of the Falklands War is to be
      found in August 2012 in the Englishman David Griffin. Griffin, a
      member of Exopolitics UK, reported in a video dated August 24,
      2014 is seen at Youtube, on an imaginary "Blue ET-base" on a
      hypothetical "Thule Island" (on maps untraceable) south of the
      Falkland Islands. There found Argentine Black-Goo-oil, which had
      been brought to the UK, employees of defense contractor Marconi
      killed in England. Previously, British special forces have the
      "ET-Base" destroyed. The oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010
      on an oil rig, BP should also be read in conjunction with Black
      Goo. [6]<br>
      <br>
      Even the New Age Magazine Light Language of Susanne Sejana Kreth
      [7] published the conspiracy theory in slightly altered form in an
      article. [8] Thus did "Argentina" 1982 Contact "blue-skinned
      horror" added, which drove with Black Goo trade and on an
      uninhabited volcanic island of Antarctica called "Thule Island"
      (36 square kilometers) were deposited. On the island there is also
      a factory plant of aliens for the production of Black Goo.
      Allegedly, this would have led to the Falklands War with Britain.<br>
      <br>
      The absurd speculations of the Bremen artist Bernhard Wimmer. [9]
      spreads a uncritical reception learned Wimmer's inventions in the
      German neo-Nazi scene, so at Politaia, Extreme News, [10] Ernst
      Köwing ("the honey man") and Jo Conrad.<br>
      <br>
      At the scene of the "Black Goo" pendant also relationships to
      so-called Archons are claiming. Among beings must be understood
      that supposedly influenced how the hypothetical reptilians in
      reality world affairs secretly. The Archons have "deep black
      eyes," reads well, and be filled with Black Goo. As viruses are
      Archons rely on "host body" with an acidic pH and could over
      alleged aura holes penetrate into these.<br>

      <b>Black Goo at Esca disease of grape plants</b><br>
      <br>
      After infection of vine plants with the fungus Phaeomoniella
      chlamydospora it comes as part of the plant disease Esca disease
      to color changes of plants and the secretion and deposition of a
      dark-brown, gummy liquid [11], the first time in 1995 from a plant
      researcher named Lucie Morton in the absence of a more appropriate
      technical term was called "Black Goo". [12] the Esca disease (or
      short Esca) is a dreaded disease of grape plants that (Greece and
      the Roman Empire) is known since ancient times. Even the writers
      of antiquity reported on this disease, which was at that time
      limited to the warmer wine regions. Only towards the end of the
      last century, this illness spread in the northern wine-growing
      regions and already results in similar prevalences as in southern
      regions.<br>

      <b>Black Goo Globuli</b><br>
      <br>
      During the research of the consortium on Morgellons we came in
      contact with black goo from German WW II bioweapon research. It
      was not easy to find a way to deal with this substance. We had
      some heavy discussions how to proceed with these findings.If black
      goo should be an unknown subject to you, please read the chapter
      in the FAQ-area first.<br>
      <br>
      On one hand there was a high probability, that there could be a
      connection to the Morgellon topic, and we were hoping, that the
      black goo could be utilized in a positive way in the process of
      finding a medication for Morgellons.<br>
      <br>
      On the other hand the first contact with this substance had
      happened without any preliminary warning , and radionic testing
      showed that the people that have been in contact with the
      substance where 100% entangled to the archaic collective sub
      consciousness carried by the Nazi-Goo.<br>
      <br>
      This was a state that was not supposed to endure. As a conclusion
      the consortium decided to develop something to detach people form
      this entanglement.<br>
      <br>
      From Homeopathy we know the rule that a disease can be cured with
      the diluted information of the disease itself. Following this
      principle, we transferred the information field of the black goo
      onto globuli. The testing showed, that these globuli were able to
      dissolve the entanglement to the Nazi-Goo.<br>
      <br>
      Apart from that, something else happened: after a period of about
      12 hours the entanglement switched back to the original collective
      sub consciousness of the planet, an entity one might call ?mother
      earth?. The subjective experience is well described in the
      pictures below.<br>
      <br>
      Encouraged by this first success, we tried to utilize the globuli
      against the aspect of the Morellons disease best described with
      the term delusional parasititis. While the presence of the
      physical black goo was enhancing the symptom subjectively by a
      factor of 100, the application of the Black Goo Globuli had an
      effect similar to an ayurvasca ceremony. Including vomiting.
      Afterwards, the delusional parasititis got better.<br>

      Later we added two more radionics codes<br>
      <br>
      The radionics representation of the affirmation ? please connect
      me with the one source?.<br>
      <br>
      And the Celani-Code, a number-code that had been channeled by
      Renzo Celani, a German healer nowadays living in Norway. The code
      is a representative for the pure natural order of things.<br>
      <br>
      The use of Black Goo Globuli should not be done for fun or out of
      curiosity. Since the event described in the bible as being
      expelled from paradise, humanity is separated from the collective
      consciousness of the planet. Re-connecting is not just a funny
      evSent, it will enhance all communicative and telepathic skills,
      and one should be willing to carry this changed state on mind for
      the rest of ones life.<br>

      ...The trace of the morgellons dates back to the NS-bioweapon
      programs. In the framework of the German WWII research under the
      administration of SS-General Hans Kammler one can find crossing
      points to other special fields of research, such as the
      exploitation of oil-schist of the Lias Epsilon, and in this or
      another context possibly the recovery of oil-schist containing
      black goo. The consortium could identify such an oil schist
      containing black goo from mining areas used by the NS-research.
      Black goo is abiotic oil from inner earth enriched with ormus.
      Black goo is able to carry consciousness. In nature it normally
      has the function to mirror the consciousness of all life on earth
      and store the information collected by the collective
      consciousness. It is the physical host of what is referred to as
      the akasha chronic. If the black goo at a certain point of history
      is extracted from inner earth, cools down and stops to move it is
      cut of from any further development. The state of consciousness is
      kind of frozen on the level of consciousness of the time it got
      stuck in the upper crust. The block goo extracted from oil schist
      from the Nazi mining area carried a pure retinoid consciousness
      with a 3-chakra-system. Intelligence, life force and sexuality,
      following the Vedic color system this represents exactly the
      colors i.e. the bio photon activity of the
      morgellon-associated-life-form. It is possible that during the NS
      research the SS recovered living mycelium of the Morelos including
      the stem cells of a higher being of that time, which possibly
      might be Lias Epsilon.<br>
      <br>
      In this case we have to speak about the symbiosis between a fungus
      and a higher developed species, which uses the fungus to reproduce
      itself. The fungus by assimilation of the alien DNA is creating
      the reproductive organs of the higher species and supplies the
      following generation with bio photons. Living on bio-photons is
      equivalent to the symbiosis of us humans with the microbes within
      our intestines that digest 90% of our food and in return supplying
      us with bio-photons. The mechanism of reproduction is unique and
      as far as we could find out hasn't been described yet by science.
      This fact alone makes it very likely that the morgellons are an
      archaic species....<br>
      <br>
      <b>What is Black Goo?</b><br>
      <br>
      Black Goo is an abiotic mineral oil from the upper crust
      containing high amounts of m-state gold and iridium. It has been
      found on Thule Island on the South Falkland Islands and under the
      Gulf of Mexico. Furthermore there exists a black oil schist
      containing this type of oil from earlier tectonic events. These
      events apparently broke up the crust of the earth.<br>
      <br>
      M-state gold and iridium function as the bio-photon-field
      attractor responsible for interconnecting life forms with their
      morphogenetic field. Sea-water contains high amounts of m-state
      matter. Within the life forms the superconducting m-state matter
      is placed inside the DNA-strings. These mono-atomic elements are
      attracting the bio-photons, while the DNA acts like a coil
      transforming the field energy into electromagnetic scalar
      potential. This m-state-matter guided bi-directional
      light-exchange of the DNA defines the scalar potential eddies
      who's fractal and holographic character is responsible for the
      form and shape of life-forms.<br>
      <br>
      Black Goo shows a hitherto unknown type of magnetism, much longer
      in range than ferromagnetism, that seems to be interactive in a
      spontaneous way, that very likely is based on bi-directional,
      annihilated photon exchange as known from m-state-matter in
      life-forms. Due to this magnetism Black Goo shows the ability to
      mechanically self-organize in many different ways and has been
      reported to carry highly intelligent consciousness.<br>
      <br>
      The Black Goo within the crust and the m-state matter within the
      biosphere seem to be inter-connected by quantum entanglement and
      function as a consciousness-mirror.<br>
      <br>
      Black Goo thus carries an a-biotic consciousness representing the
      collective consciousness of the entire bio-sphere. The form of
      organization is holographic, thus every portion of Black Go is
      able to interact as a fully conscious being. Looking at the
      mythological reception of nature it has been described as Lucifer,
      Mother Earth, the Black Madonna, and is meant to be the physical
      location of the collective memory of mankind, aka the akasha
      chronic.<br>
      <br>
      The quantum entanglement between life-forms and the Black Goo
      inside the earth seems to lead to a very high degree of
      self-similarity. In result, the Goo extracted by past geologic
      events carries a different type of consciousness than the Black
      Goo of our days. The Black Goo with an age of about 300 million
      years extracted from oil schist even today still carries a
      reptilian type of consciousness. <br>
      <br>
      This dis-connection from the actual state of consciousness has
      been regarded in mythology as the fall of Lucifer.<br>
      <br>
      During the evolution of life certain life forms stayed connected
      to the geologically marginalized Black Goo and thus got stuck on
      reptilian consciousness. When humans are brought into contact with
      this type of Black Goo, the light-transfer of the bio-field of the
      human body might be redirected onto the archaic Black Goo, which
      might reduce the complexity of the human Chakra System to blue,
      yellow and red, i.e. to mental abilities, life force and
      sexuality. It leads to a state of being intelligent, but heartless
      and cold in appearance. It disconnects the human from the
      collective consciousness of his time.<br>
      <br>
      Something like this must have happened in the event described in
      the mythology as the deterioration from paradise. The effect seems
      to be handed over to following generations referred to as the
      heritable sin mentioned in the bible by ongoing quantum
      entanglement transferred with the genetic information. It also
      refers to the traditions of the bloodlines, who seem to try to
      keep this reptilian entanglement as strong as possible.<br>
      <br>
      Archaic Black Goo played a major role in black magic rites, last
      intensively researched by the inner core of the German SS. In the
      middle-ages these black stones were utilized by black magicians to
      connect with archonts, aka demons, archaic beings which have
      developed out of early spiders who entirely live as light
      parasites and try to align with humans to form a symbiosis, where
      the archont feeds on the bio-photons of the human and the human
      profits from the mental (magical) abilities of the archonts. <br>

      Public officer Ricardo Azevedo is turning heads in his hometown of
      Sao Paulo, Brazil, with his intriguing invention – a motorcycle
      that runs on water. The revolutionary bike – aptly dubbed ‘T Power
      H2O’ – is able to travel up to 310 miles (nearly 500 kilometers)
      on a single liter of water!<br>
      <br>
      In a recently released video, Azevedo is shown drinking from a
      water bottle before pouring it into the tank to prove that his
      bike runs solely on water and not some kind of fuel. But clean
      water is optional, as he later demonstrates by filling the tank
      with polluted water from the Tiete River.<br>
      <br>
      The T Power H2O motorcycle incorporates an external car battery
      that produces electricity and separates hydrogen from water
      molecules. This results in combustion, releasing energy that fuels
      the bike. “The advantage of this motorcycle, which works with the
      hydrogen that comes from the water, is that the result that comes
      of the exhaust is water vapor,” Azevedo explains. “This is
      different from gasoline, the result of which is carbon monoxide.”<br>
      <br>
      <div align="center"><img alt="" src="azavedo.jpg" height="365"
          width="634"><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      For now, Azevedo’s special motorcycle is only a prototype, but
      since it doesn’t compromise on looks – it seems every bit as cool
      and rugged as a regular motorcycle – it may prove a hit with
      motorcycle enthusiasts if he can find investors willing to mass
      produce it.<br>
      <br>
      News of the T Power H2O motorbike and footage of Ricardo Azevedo
      driving and refueling it with water captured the imagination of
      thousands of motorists in South America, but also generated some
      concerns about the accuracy of the reports. A number of people
      have claimed that the external battery used for the electrolysis
      process could not generate enough energy to keep the bike running
      for the reported 310 miles. To this Azevedo answered that they use
      a system similar to the Kinetic Energy Recovery System (KERS) used
      in Formula 1 to recharge the battery on the go. While this doe not
      eliminate the need for an eventual recharge, it increases battery
      life significantly. Thus the bike can run for approximately 10
      hours.<br>
      <br>
      Others claimed that the amount of hydrogen created through simple
      electrolysis could not generate enough energy to power the T Power
      H2O. Gabriel Azevedo, who helped his father build the
      revolutionary motorcycle, said they use a variety of chemical
      additives that make the electrolysis process 350% more efficient.
      He added that they tested a number of additives of six months, and
      that they could achieve even better results, but more research is
      necessary. Azevedo also pointed out that even though these
      additives raise the cost of the system, it’s still more
      cost-effective than common combustion systems.<br>
      <br>
      Another inconsistency pointed out by readers was that the hydrogen
      seemed to pass through the motorcycle’s original engine, without
      any modifications. Both Ricardo Azevedo and Ernesto Gonzalez, a
      professor of chemistry at the University of Sao Paulo confirmed
      that the original combustion system can be used to burn hydrogen
      without any problem. They referred to the cars that ran on cooking
      oil during the 80’s and 90’s as an example.<br>
      <br>
      There were a number of other questions brought up by amateur
      motorists, but Azevedo answered them all and offered to take the T
      Power H2O to an official Honda motorcycle dealer where proper
      tests can be performed in order to justify his claims. “I’ve made
      contact with the dealership and a qualified mechanic will conduct
      and assess the tests. I am also willing to explain and demonstrate
      the system for those who are interested,” he said<br>

          <b>Electrocombustion engine&nbsp; </b></big><br>

      <br>
      A reciprocating motor, comprising: a piston/cylinder assembly,
      having an input/output port; an electrolytic cell for generating a
      combustible mixture of hydrogen and oxygen gases, the cell being
      connected to the input/output port of the piston/cylinder
      assembly; and, means for igniting the combustible mixture in the
      cylinder, the piston being first driven outwardly by the force of
      the exploding gas mixture, and immediately afterward, being pulled
      back by a vacuum formed when the exploded gas mixture recombines
      into a trace amount of water, whereby a single charge of the
      combustible gas mixture achieves a double power stroke. The
      input/output port is preferably funnel shaped, the larger end
      being directed into the cylinder, and the smaller end being
      directed into the electrolytic cell. The electrolytic cell
      utilizes sets of bipolar electrodes in the form of laminated
      panels having a wrap-around overlapping border. A free wheeling
      piston can be utilized to drive a pump. A crank shaft arrangement
      can be utilized to translate the reciprocating motion into rotary
      motion. The electrolytic cell is provided with an integral
      backfire arrestor in the form of mesh material disposed between
      the electrodes and the outlet of the cell. The trace amounts of
      water formed by the recombination of the hydrogen and oxygen gases
      is recycled to the cell through the input/output port.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      <b>1. Field of the Invention</b><br>
      <br>
      This invention relates to electro-chemical combustion engines, and
      in particular, to an engine utilizing the recombination of
      hydrogen and oxygen gases to provide a double power stroke for a
      piston/cylinder assembly, as a means of using electric power as
      the prime energizer of an internal combustion piston engine.<br>
      <br>
      <b>2. Prior Art</b><br>
      <br>
      Many apparatus are known wherein an electrolytic cell is used to
      generate hydrogen gas, for example, which then forms all or part
      of the fuel mixture used in an otherwise typical internal
      combustion engine. In each of these instances, the oxygen gas is
      not used in the fuel mixture, and it is generally conceded that
      the use of hydrogen and oxygen gases as a fuel is too dangerous.
      In modern times, the use of hydrogen and oxygen gases as a fuel
      seems limited to the field of welding. Two examples of this use
      are described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,014,777-Brown and No.
      3,356,600-Henes. In two engine applications, for example, the
      hydrogen and oxygen mixture is mixed with air from the atmosphere,
      as in U.S. Pat. No. 3,980,053-Horvath and in another is mixed with
      the fuel, as in U.S. Pat. No. 4,023,545-Mosher, et al. In each of
      these instances, the use of hydrogen and oxygen gas alone is not
      even suggested, and in many instances, is said to be dangerous or
      impractical. U.S. Pat. Nos. 2,365,330-Carmicahel and
      3,311,097-Mittelsteadt disclose the use of hydrogen and oxygen as
      a fuel, however, the mixture is said to be used with a typical
      internal combustion engine. Typical internal combustion engines
      can not operate on the explosion-implosion principle utilized in
      this invention. U.S. Pat. No. 2,496,623-Fragale discloses a two
      cycle internal combustion engine which operates on hydrogen and
      oxygen gas mixture, but the piston is provided with a number of
      grooves, in order that water formed during the combustion process
      can run out of the cylinder. Such a configuration would preclude
      the use of a vacuum to provide the second half of the double power
      stroke. U.S. Pat. No. 1,905,627-Holland purports to teach the use
      of hydrogen and oxygen gas, alone, to operate an internal
      combustion engine. The engine, however, requires two actuated
      valve assemblies, and makes no mention of the formation of a
      vacuum or a double power stroke. In fact, it is likely that the
      Holland apparatus would be rendered inoperable as any vacuum
      formed would cause both valves to open, more than likely
      preventing the piston from being pulled back by the vacuum,
      obviating the double power stroke of this invention.<br>
      <br>
      In summary, there is no known device comparable to the
      electro-combustion engine taught herein, wherein hydrogen and
      oxygen gases, alone, and in a stochiometric combustible
      proportion, are used as the sole energizer for powering a piston
      in a piston/cylinder assembly, wherein no valves are needed
      between the source of the hydrogen and oxygen gases and the
      cylinder, and wherein the piston/cylinder assembly is sufficiently
      sealed that upon ignition of the gas mixture, the piston is first
      driven outwardly, and after recombination of the gases into trace
      amounts of water, the piston is pulled back into the cylinder by
      the resulting vacuum suction.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      To provide a system which uses electricity as prime energizer to
      run an internal-combustion engine. It is an object of this
      invention to provide a non-polluting engine power system.<br>
      <br>
      It is yet another object of this invention to provide an engine
      power system wherein the combustible mixture is water, which is
      substantially recycled.<br>
      <br>
      It is yet another object of this invention to utilize a
      combustible mixture of hydrogen and oxygen gases, an anaero
      environment, to provide a double power stroke in a piston/cylinder
      assembly.<br>
      <br>
      It is yet another object of this invention to utilize the vacuum
      formed after the recombination of hydrogen and oxygen gases to
      double the power output with respect to the energy required to
      obtain hydrogen and oxygen from water.<br>
      <br>
      It is yet another object of this invention to provide more
      efficient means for the production of hydrogen and oxygen gases.<br>
      <br>
      It is yet another object of this invention to provide an improved
      bipolar electrode for electrolytic processes.<br>
      <br>
      It is still another object of this invention to provide a backfire
      arrestor so that hydrogen and oxygen gases may be safely used as a
      sole fuel for electro-combustion engines and other applications.<br>
      <br>
      These and other objects of this invention are accomplished by, in
      the most basic form, a reciprocating motor, comprising: a
      piston/cylinder assembly, having an input/output port; an
      electrolytic cell for generating a combustible mixture of hydrogen
      and oxygen gases, the cell being connected to the input/output
      port of the piston/cylinder assembly; and, means for igniting the
      combustible mixture in the cylinder, the piston being first driven
      outwardly by the force of the exploding gas mixture, and
      immediately afterward, being pulled back by a vacuum formed when
      the exploded gas mixture recombines into a trace amount of water,
      whereby a single charge of the combustible gas mixture achieves a
      double power stroke. The input/output port is preferably funnel
      shaped, the larger end being directed into the cylinder, and the
      smaller end being directed into the electrolytic cell. The
      electrolytic cell utilizes sets of bipolar electrodes in the form
      of laminated panels having a wrap-around overlapping border. A
      free wheeling piston can be utilized to drive a pump. A crank
      shaft arrangement can be utilized to translate the reciprocating
      motion into rotary motion. The electrolytic cell is provided with
      an integral backfire arrestor in the form of mesh material
      disposed between the electrodes and the outlet of the cell. The
      trace amounts of water formed by the recombination of the hydrogen
      and oxygen gases are recycled to the cell through the input/output
      port.<br>
      <br>
      Not only does this invention provide more efficient means for
      electrolizing hydrogen and oxygen gases, this invention doubles
      the efficiency of any electrolytic cell, by utilizing the vacuum
      formed as a result of the recombination of hydrogen and oxygen
      gases to pull a piston back onto a cylinder, thereby effectively
      doubling the power with respect to the energy required to run the
      electrolytic cell. Further, problems due to heat and friction can
      also be minimized, as the piston/cylinder assembly runs
      essentially cool. That is, notwithstanding the very high
      temperature of the hydrogen-oxygen explosion, there is virtually
      no heat build up even when the motor is run continuously. Heat
      will be mostly friction from the working parts of the engine. The
      speed of the motor can be controlled electrically, that is by
      adjusting the voltage applied to the electrodes in the
      electrolytic cell and/or by changing the geometry of the
      combustion chamber.<br>

      <b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</b><br>
      <br>
      This invention, utilized in one of its most elemental forms, is
      shown in FIG. 1. The entire apparatus 10 is a fluid pump. The
      fluid pump 10 comprises a cylinder 12 in which a reciprocating
      piston 14 is slideably disposed. Two sealing rings 16 encircle the
      piston 14. The piston 14 is essentially free-floating within the
      cylinder, that is, is not necessarily connected to anything else.
      Stops formed by protrusions in the inner wall of the cylinder, not
      shown for purposes of clarification, may be utilized to define the
      inner and outer limits of movement of the piston within the
      cylinder.<br>
      <br>
      An electrolytic cell 18 is provided for electrolizing water, in
      order to form a combustible mixture of hydrogen and oxygen gas.
      This combination of gases has been termed "HyOx", and will be so
      referred to hereinafter. The electrolytic cell 18 is provided with
      at least one set 20 of electrodes, and preferably a plurality of
      such sets. In the presently preferred embodiment, each set 20 of
      electrodes comprises eleven individual bipolar electrode plates
      22. The middle electrode plate 22m is connected to the positive
      terminal of a direct current source. The two end plates 22e are
      connected to the negative terminal of the direct current source or
      the opposite. The electrolytic solution in the cell is preferably
      bicarbonate of soda dissolved in water. This solution is safe to
      touch, even in the highest concentrations, and it is just as
      effective, if not more effective than other caustic electrolytic
      solutions which are known and used in other applications and are
      not to be barred. A backfire arrestor is formed by a metal or
      plastic mesh mass or otherwise 26, disposed above the electrode
      plates and below the outlet 28 of the electrolytic cell. Particles
      of water clinging the mesh material effectively eliminate the
      hazards of backfire, and at the same time, permit the electrolized
      HyOx to pass therethrough, into the cylinder. A sufficiently
      porous sponge material would also be suitable. The electrolytic
      cell and cylinder are connected by an input/output port 30. The
      input/output port 30 is preferably funnel shaped, having its
      larger end 32 directed toward the interior of the cylinder, and
      its smaller end 34 directed to the electrolytic cell. The HyOx
      mixture is ignited by spark plug 36. A switch 38 is disposed at
      the top of the cylinder, mounted therein between two electrically
      insulated contacts 40 and 42. A bow shaped member 44 has one end
      thereof flexibly mounted to contact 42. The other end is a contact
      switch, similar to the points of a distributor which breaks
      contact with member 40, whenever it is engaged by the pistor 14
      moving in toward the cylinder, or to the right with respect to the
      orientation of FIG. 1. Contact 40 is connected to the insulated
      terminal of the spark plug 36. Contact 42 is connected to the
      positive terminal of a high voltage alternating current source.
      The cylinder wall, which is made from metal, is connected by a
      wire 46 to the common terminals of the alternating current source.
      A single power source 48 is indicated, which must supply high
      voltage alternating current to the spark plug 36 and direct low
      voltage current, through a controller 50, to the electrode plates
      22 of the electrolytic cell. The power source 48 may be an
      alternating current source, having an AC/DC convertor for powering
      the electrolytic cell, or it may be a direct current source having
      a DC/AC convertor for powering the spark plug. Such DC/AC
      convertors are used in the electronic ignition systems of most
      automobiles produced today, and generally involve the use of a
      transistor chopping circuit in conjunction with the primary of a
      transformer. The chopper circuit changes the DC input to a square
      wave, which is in effect an alternating current, which can then be
      stepped up by a teslacoil and used to fire the spark plug.
      Whenever the piston disengages switch 44, opening the contact
      thereof, the spark plug is fired. This occurs in each instance
      when the piston is at its rightmost position, or furthest into the
      cylinder towards the head.<br>
      <br>
      When a DC current is passed through the electrolytic solution,
      hydrogen and oxygen gases are liberted from the fluid in the cell,
      at the surface of the electrode plates. These gases rise to the
      top of the electrolytic cell, and pass into the cylinder through
      the input/output port 30. The pressure and volume of gases filling
      the cylinder is determined by the voltage level at which the
      electrolytic cell is operated. Certain optimum levels have been
      discovered, which will be discussed more fully hereinafter.
      Assuming that the apparatus is in an operational condition, at
      sometime the piston 14 will be moving to the right, and will
      engage switch 38. When contact is cut the spark plug 36 fires, and
      the HyOx, comprising a combustible mixture of hydrogen and oxygen
      gas, explosively recombines. The force of the explosion of the
      recombining gases forces the piston out of the cylinder, or toward
      the left, toward the extreme position shown in FIG. 2. It will be
      appreciated that the HyOx formed a certain volume of gas within a
      very small part of the cylinder immediately prior to ignition.
      When the hydrogen and oxygen gases recombine, they form a trace
      amount of water, as well as a vacuum, as the volume of the trace
      amount of water is very significantly smaller than the volume
      previously occupied by the HyOx in the gaseous state. The effect
      of this vacuum is multiplied by the fact that the piston has been
      driven in a direction out of the cylinder, so that the trace
      amount of water now occupies not only the original volume of the
      HyOx gases, but a volume which may be five times, ten times or
      more, larger than the original volume. This very strong vacuum
      which is created forcefully pulls the piston back into the
      cylinder, in the direction of the spark plug and switch 38. As the
      piston is pulled back into the cylinder, further HyOx is also
      pulled into the cylinder, so that by the time the piston once
      again engages switch 38, there is further explosion which drives
      the piston outwardly, followed by what is in effect an implosion,
      as the vacuum draws the piston back up. This explosion/implosion
      effect has been termed "EXPIMP" and will be so referred to
      hereinafter.<br>
      <br>
      In most engines which utilize hydrogen gas or the combination of
      hydrogen and oxygen gas for use as a fuel or a fuel additive, the
      hydrogen and oxygen gas is almost always mixed with air prior to
      combustion. The combustion of hydrogen and oxygen gas together
      with air, and perhaps with gasoline, means that a vacuum will not
      be formed as a result of the combustion process, or in any event,
      if a vacuum is formed, it will be too weak to have any effect on
      movement of the piston. The vacuum effect is also apt to be
      dissipated, if present at all, when the exhaust valve opens in the
      typical four cycle engine. In such known engines, the piston
      returns to the firing position within the cylinder as a result of
      either momentum or the firing of other piston cylinder assemblies
      in a bank of piston cylinder assemblies. Such mechanisms for
      returning the piston are not necessary according to this
      invention, as the piston returns automatically and powerfully. It
      may be desirable to provide this apparatus with a means for
      bringing the piston back to a starting position, should it misfire
      in some fashion or should the vacuum be lost, for example, by
      improper functioning of the electrolytic cell or missing spark
      plug.<br>
      <br>
      The reciprocating motion of the piston may be directly utilized in
      the fluid pump illustrated in FIGS. 1 and 2. During the upstroke
      of the piston, immediately preceeding the position of the piston
      as shown in FIG. 1, fluid, such as air or water, may be drawn into
      one or more funnel-like inlets 52, as shown by arrows 54. The end
      of the cylinder 12 is connected to a discharge pipe 56, which has
      a sealing flap valve 58 hingedly mounted at the end thereof. The
      upstroke of the piston draws the flap valve 58 closed, so that
      fluid can be drawn into the inlets 52. When the spark plug is
      ignited, the piston is driven to the position shown in FIG. 2. As
      it moves in this direction, flap valve 58 is opened so that fluid
      can leave exit pipe 56, as shown by arrow 60. At the same time,
      due to the funnel shape of the inlets 52, and a venturi effect,
      keeps the fluid flowing in through the inlets. Due to vortices or
      otherwise, illustrated by arrows 62, substantially all of the
      fluid is forcefully expelled. When the next vacuum is formed, the
      piston is drawn back into the cylinder, closing flap valve 58 and
      drawing more fluid in through inlets 52. As the piston
      reciprocates within the cylinder 14, a steady pulse jet of fluid
      may be pumped. Such an arrangement is particularly suited for use
      on underwater jet propulsion systems for a marine vehicle, as the
      engine runs very cool anyhow, eliminating the need for
      sophisticated cooling equipment, heat exchangers and the like. It
      will be appreciated that the trace amounts of water, which may be
      partially in the form of steam, will eventually become water and
      find their way back into the translator, flowing through the
      input/output port 30, where they can be re-dissociated into HyOx.
      The sealing rings 16 and the inner surface of the cylinder may be
      made of or coated with low friction plastic material, such as
      Teflon. The components are not subject to damage from the HyOx
      explosion, because there is only enougn oxygen to burn the
      hydrogen, as long as care is taken to use compatible materials.<br>
      <br>
      An alternative embodiment of a more sophisticated electrolytic
      cell for producing HyOx in accordance with this invention is
      illustrated in FIG. 3. This embodiment contains many safety
      devices and monitors, which of course would not be necessary in
      the normal course of operation. As in many instances, they are
      provided in order to prevent dangerous conditions and emergency
      situations. The electrolytic cell 100 comprises a number of sets
      120 of bipolar electrodes, similar to those diagrammatically
      illustrated in FIG. 1. The number of sets utilized will depend
      upon the power requirements of the particular HyOx engine and the
      consequent desired capacity of the electrolytic cell. An enlarged
      view of a set of electrodes 120 is shown in FIG. 4. In the
      presently preferred embodiment, eleven such bipolar plates 122 are
      mounted in each set 120. It is preferable that the plates be
      spaced as closely together as possible, without of course touching
      one another. The closer the plates, the less resistance to current
      flow through the electrolytic solution. As technology permits,
      separations on the order of molecular diameters, of water for
      example, are anticipated. Each bipolar electrode comprises a
      positive and negative plate, one clad around the other. This
      cladding which also could be sprayed or plated is further
      illustrated in FIGS. 5 and 6. The inner electrode plate 125 is a
      simple rectangular sheet. The outer member 126 has its perimeter
      bent around the edges of the inner plate 124, forming a border or
      frame 128 therearound. When the electrodes are mounted in rows,
      the exposed surface of the inner plate always faces the back of
      the cladding plate of the adjacent electrode. It has been found
      that this arrangement substantially reduces stray current, and in
      so doing, reduces the operating temperature of the electrolytic
      cell and other efficiency-wise benefits. It has been found that
      increases in the temperature of the electrolytic cell result in
      progressively inefficient operation and lower production levels of
      HyOx and much energy is wasted in just heating the water. For this
      we prefer to have a temperature control switch connected to the
      heating unit. In one presently preferred embodiment, the outer
      electrode plate is formed from titanium and the inner plate is
      formed from stainless steel. Many different combinations of
      electrode materials may be utilized relating to cathodo-anodic
      relationship with similar results, although the bipolar, clad
      overlapped edge arrangement is preferred irrespective of the
      choice of materials.<br>
      <br>
      A further unexpected result of the experiments which resulted in
      this invention is that lower than expected production rates of
      gases provide a higher return with respect to the relative cost of
      energy input than larger outputs. Some of this is of course due to
      heating which takes place at higher current and voltage levels,
      which heating impedes the electrolytic process. The following
      chart indicates experimental results of a typical yet inefficient
      cell. The chart indicates the current drawn by the electrolytic
      cell (Amps), the voltage across each set of electrode plates
      (Volts), the product of the amps and volts, indicating the power
      consumption (Watts Used) and the assigned BTU-WATT value of the
      hydrogen involved in accordance with the Handbook of Chemistry and
      Physics.<br>

      As can be seen from the chart, the break even point, market "BEP"
      is approximately 0.4 amps and 3.05 volts in, using 12.2 watts for
      the input and getting 12 Watts-BTU output. Subsequent cells have
      proved much more efficient at all input levels, but the BEP
      remains substantially the same. For all voltage and amperage
      levels below the break even point, the Watts-BTU produced exceeds
      the water used. This result is even further amplified because the
      "EXPIMP" principle supplies power to the piston when it is
      expelled and supplies power to the piston when it is drawn back,
      thereby doubling the work accomplished by a single charge of HyOx.
      It has been found that an adequate supply of HyOx can be provided
      by an electrolytic cell having a volume approximately twice that
      of the displacement of the piston within the cylinder. In a
      multi-piston engine it would likely be more economical to have a
      small electrolytic cell for each cylinder, rather than a single
      large electrolytic cell, however individual applications may
      require some compromise between the two extremes.<br>
      <br>
      Referring once again to FIG. 3, the electrolytic cell has angled
      or dome shaped top walls 102 and 104, which direct HyOx gas to the
      inlet portion 106 of an input/output port 108, whose larger end
      110 is connected to, for example, a piston/cylinder assembly such
      as that shown in FIG. 1 or that shown in FIG. 7. The top portion
      of electrolytic cell is packed with mesh filler material. The
      uppermost portion is closely packed with a metallic wool mesh 112
      of fine gauge. The section between the fine metal mesh 112 and the
      tops of the electrode plates is less densely packed with a heavier
      gauge metallic or plastic mesh 114. The minimum water level 116
      corresponds to a level within the more open mesh 114, and the
      maximum water level 118 corresponds to a level slightly above the
      bottom of the fine mesh 112. What happens is that during the
      course of electrocumbustion the trace amounts of water formed in
      cylinders as steam in translator will eventually condense in part,
      and will roll down input/output port 108, being for the most part
      trapped in the opening 132 of drain pipe 134, so that recycling of
      the water at each explosion will not interfere significantly with
      the out flow of HyOx. In order to maintain the water level between
      the desired minimum and maximum levels, sensors 136 are mounted
      through the walls of the electrolytic cell. A fluid level control
      automatically regulates the input of electrolytic solution through
      pump valve 140, and permits electrolytic solution to be discharged
      through pressure relief valve 142. Pressure relief valve 142 may
      also be adjusted to operate independently, in the event pressure
      within the electrolytic cell exceeds safe levels. The temperature
      and pressure in the cell may be monitored by sensors 144 and 146
      respectively. Terminals 148 and 150 are also provided, for
      powering the electrode plates. A controller 152 is used to monitor
      and control the current and voltage levels so as to provide the
      desired output of HyOx and thereby control engine speed, output or
      power. The apparatus is powered by a battery or a bank of
      batteries 154, and in a reciprocating engine configuration, may
      also be provided with a direct current generator 156 which can be
      used to recharge the battery. The average maximum pressure within
      the electrolytic cell needed to provide proper operation is
      approximately 15 pounds per square inch.<br>
      <br>
      The application of the principles of this invention as applied to
      a reciprocating internal combustion engine are illustrated in
      FIGS. 7, 8 and 9. An engine 200 comprises a cylinder 202, a piston
      204 and one or more electrolytic cells 206 and 208. The engine,
      which can be so constructed as to have a unitary appearance is
      also provided with electrolytic fluid reservoirs 210. In this
      instance, the piston is connected to a crank shaft assembly 212,
      so that the reciprocating motion of the piston is translated to
      rotary motion. Inasmuch as such an arrangement may be used in a
      multi-cylinder arrangement, a timing control 214 is used in
      conjunction with controlling the AC power source 216 utilized to
      fire spark plug 218. Sets 220 of bipolar electrode plates, as
      described hereinbefore, are disposed within the electrolytic
      cells, in order to produce HyOx. The electrolytic cells are
      powered through terminals 222 and 224. Mesh materials 226 and 228,
      corresponding to the mesh material 112 and 114 described in
      connection with FIG. 3 are disposed at the top of the electrolytic
      cell, providing a flashback arrestor capability. Input/output
      ports 230 and 232 connect each electrolytic cell with the
      cylinder. As in the other embodiment described in connection with
      FIGS. 1 and 2, the piston is provided with sealing rings 234. The
      operation of this engine is identical to the fluid pumping engine.
      HyOx enters the cylinder when the piston is at the top of its
      upstroke, and upon ignition by the spark plug explodes, forcing
      the piston downwardly, or out of the cylinder. After the piston
      has travelled sufficiently far to rotate the cam shaft more than
      180 DEG, the resulting vacuum pulls the piston back up into the
      cylinder, completing one revolution of rotary motion with two
      power strokes. As the piston moves back up the cylinder, more HyOx
      is pulled and pumped therein helped by the pressure at translator
      and after the piston passes top dead center, a further ignition
      drives the piston back downwardly, repeating the cycle. This
      operation is possible without opening and closing valves in
      connection with ports 230 and 232, as operation can be controlled
      by adjusting the voltage across the electrode plates. However, if
      desired, further control can be provided by flap or other valve as
      illustrated in FIG. 10. In a simple one cylinder engine it would
      also be possible to use a self-firing mechanism such as that
      described in connection with the fluid pump of FIGS. 1 and 2. The
      various safety and control members described in connection with
      FIG. 3 have been eliminated from this embodiment for purposes of
      clarification, however they may also be included as well. Further,
      in such an arrangement, the electrolytic cell need not be built
      integrally with or mounted adjacent to the piston/cylinder
      assembly, although this is a convenient arrangement as it saves
      space. It must be remembered that if a modified engine according
      to this invention is used in place of a conventional internal
      combustion engine, the elimination of the carburetor, air filter,
      exhaust manifold, intake manifold, catalytic converter and most of
      the cooling system, just to name a few, will result in
      considerable savings in weight and space, notwithstanding the
      necessity to provide one or more batteries.<br>
      <br>
      A more sophisticated system for use in an engine which might
      replace a conventional internal combustion engine, having a
      plurality of cylinders, is illustrated in block diagram form in
      FIG. 11. An electrolytic cell 300 produces hydrogen gas, oxygen
      gas and some amount of water therewith. This mixture is passed
      through dehumidifier 302, which removes much of the liquid water,
      allowing it to run into a settling basin 304. The dehumidified
      HyOx is then passed through a dessicator 306, to further dry it.
      From the dessicator, the dry HyOx passes through a backfire
      arrestor 308, either similar to those described herein, or similar
      to those now available. The dried HyOx then passes into one of the
      piston cylinder assemblies, where it is ignited. The explosion
      drives the piston downwardly, and the resulting vacuum pulls the
      piston back up. Over a long period of time, there may be an
      accumulation of liquid water in the cylinder, as it can not simply
      pass back through the two-way input/output port of the previously
      described embodiments. Accordingly, a water exhaust valve 312 is
      provided through which steam can escape, and be directed into a
      cooling radiator 314. The cooled water is then directed into the
      settling basin 304, passed through cleansing filter 316, and
      finally directed back into the electrolytic cell to be recycled
      and re-electrolized. A timing means for igniting the HyOx charge
      in each cylinder, perhaps in the form of a modified distributor,
      can also be provided.<br>
      <br>
      The various applications to which the "EXPIMP" principle may be
      applied aretoo numerous to list and describe in detail. However,
      these include for example the use of HyOx as an explosive, which
      causes a minimum of damage due to the vacuum following every
      explosion. This is particularly advantageous in mining and under
      water demolition. Inasmuch as reciprocating motion of a
      piston/cylinder assembly can be used either directly as
      illustrated in the water pump, or indirectly as illustrated in the
      engine shown in FIGS. 7, 8 and 9, HyOx powered engines operating
      on the "EXPIMP" principle, can be used for almost any application,
      with the knowledge that they can be operated safely, and will
      under all conditions, operate without any pollutant exhaust
      whatsoever. This invention also provides an improved electrolytic
      cell, so that HyOx can be more easily utilized in known
      applications, such as welding, and the like.<br>

      Intensive effort has led to numerous breakthroughs for
      photoprocesses. So far, however, energy conversion efficiency for
      the visible-light photocatalytic splitting of water is still very
      low. In this paper, we demonstrate (1)
      surface-diffuse-reflected-light can be 2 orders of magnitude more
      efficient than incident light for photocatalysis, (2) the
      inefficiency of absorbed visible light for the photocatalytic H2
      production from water with a sacrificial agent is due to its
      kinetic limitation, and (3) the dispersion of black Pt/TiO2
      catalyst on the light-diffuse-reflection-surface of a SiO2
      substrate provides a possibility for exploiting a temperature
      higher than H2O boiling point to overcome the kinetic limitation
      of visible light photocatalytic hydrogen production. Those
      findings create a novel temperature-induced visible light
      photocatalytic H2 production from water steam with a sacrificial
      agent, which exhibits a high photohydrogen yield of 497
      mmol/h/gcat with a large apparent quantum efficiency (QE) of 65.7%
      for entire visible light range at 280 °C. The QE and yield are one
      and 2 orders of magnitude larger than most reported results,
      respectively.<br>

      Mimicking photosynthesis is not easy. The bottleneck of artificial
      photosynthesis is visible light as converting it into other energy
      is not efficient. Researchers at Michigan Technological University
      have found a way to solve this issue, leading to an efficient
      technique to produce hydrogen fuel. Last week, the Journal of
      Physical Chemistry published their work. <br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      The technique was developed by Yun Hang Hu, the Charles and
      Carroll McArthur professor of Materials Science and Engineer, and
      his PhD student, Bing Han, at Michigan Tech.<br>
      <br>
      "Hydrogen is the future of cars," says Hu. "And if you want to
      power hydrogen cars, you have to make hydrogen fuels."<br>
      <br>
      In this new hydrogen production process, the key is to understand
      the interactions of a catalyst, light and a sacrificial molecule.
      The method could make the sustainable production of hydrogen fuels
      more efficient.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      <b>Playbook of Black Titanium Dioxide, Methanol and Light</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      As if in a complex sports game, the exchanges and counters between
      the materials used to split water look like a chemistry playbook.
      The players are black titanium dioxide (TiO2) and methanol (CH3OH)
      pitted against electron-hole recombination.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      The goal of the game is to produce hydrogen molecules. Basically,
      that's done by moving an electron from one place to another, like
      kicking a football to get a field goal. To make that score, a
      water molecule captures an electron excited within a material.
      When excited, electrons move up and down in different bands; the
      lower one here is the valence band and the higher one is the
      conduction band. The valence band and the conduction band are like
      goal posts, and between them is the band gap, which is like the
      playing field. The excited electron is the ball being passed
      around.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      Solar energy, with both ultraviolet (UV) and visible light energy,
      is what gets this ball rolling. Light energy bounces off the first
      player, titanium dioxide, which is the material where the valence
      band and conduction band are in play. That excites an electron,
      making it a photo-excited charge that shoots up towards the
      conduction band. For UV light, the playing field is pretty big,
      and the band gap stretches 3.2 electron volts wide.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>

      method to produce hydrogen fuels using water and light. Credit:

      <br>
      Here's where the game gets more complicated, Harry Potter
      Quidditch-style, with balls that move quickly on their own.
      Electrons tend to zip like a golden snitch, and they sometimes
      misbehave, scurrying back to their starting place in the valence
      band, which negates the goal score and H2 production.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      Enter player two: methanol. When the photo-excited electron shoots
      toward the conduction band, the methanol donates an electron via
      an oxidation reaction to swoop in and block the open spot left in
      the valence band. This sacrificial agent acts as a defense against
      the photo-excited electron snitching and scurrying its way back.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      <b>Playing in the Visible Light Spectrum</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The play between titanium dioxide, methanol and UV light serves up
      hydrogen (H2) molecules. However, UV is only a very small part (4
      percent) of solar energy. It is important to use visible light,
      since it constitutes about 45 percent of solar energy. Hu's team
      has been able to increase the yield and energy efficiency up to
      two magnitudes greater than previously reported results using
      visible light instead of UV. But they had to change the playing
      field to do so.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      "It's a two-part process," Hu says, explaining that the catalyst
      is black titanium dioxide (with 1 percent platinum), which
      attaches to a silicon dioxide substrate in their set-up. Hu's team
      first generated a "light-diffuse-reflected surface" for the
      silicon dioxide, making it bumpy, which traps light waves and
      bounces them around. "We put the catalyst on the scattered
      surface, and it can increase the light absorption by one hundred
      times," he explains.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      Light absorption is an important step that generates photo-excited
      electrons, but it's only part of what's needed. Using visible
      light shortens the playing field, altering the band gap to only
      1.3 electron volts in black titanium oxide. Specifically, that's
      because an electron is excited to conduction band from Ti3+ energy
      level instead of the valence band, which is like starting at the
      10-yard line instead of the 50-yard line<br>
      <br>
      The photo-excited electron has less distance to travel to the
      conduction band, but methanol doesn't like to play along. The
      shortened distance from methanol to Ti3+ energy level greatly
      reduces methanol's oxidation reaction, giving it less motivation
      to fill the leftover hole in the Ti3+ energy level. So, it needed
      a little heat in the second step of the process to get that
      reaction going again.<br>
      <br>
      "We used temperature to increase the energy for methanol oxidation
      to donate electrons," Hu says, adding that in the experiment they
      found 280 degrees Celsius to be the sweet spot. <br>
      <br>
      With the modified silicon dioxide substrate and heat, Hu's team
      also had to design a different set-up for the experiment. The
      water they used was steam, pushed into a chamber where it collided
      with a disk of roughened silicon dioxide studded with black
      titanium dioxide-platinum catalyst. Visible light then excited the
      electrons, and the hydrogen could then be syphoned off.<br>
      <br>
      "The set-up is not complicated," Hu says. "It's actually
      convenient for scaling up commercially."<br>
      <br>
      Furthermore, this work created a hybrid process using both light
      and heat, which has opened a new door for visible light
      photosynthesis. The method is a big step closer to mimicking
      photosynthesis.<br>

            effects of nuclear radiation 24 hours after exposure</b></big><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      A new breakthrough has been reported in countering the deadly
      effects of radiation exposure. A single injection of a
      regenerative peptide was shown to significantly increase survival
      in mice when given 24 hours after nuclear radiation exposure. <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
      An interdisciplinary research team led by The University of Texas
      Medical Branch at Galveston reports a new breakthrough in
      countering the deadly effects of radiation exposure. A single
      injection of a regenerative peptide was shown to significantly
      increase survival in mice when given 24 hours after nuclear
      radiation exposure. The study currently appears in Laboratory
      Investigation, a journal in the Nature Publishing group.<br>
      <br>
      UTMB lead author Carla Kantara, postdoctoral fellow in
      biochemistry and molecular biology, said that a single injection
      of the investigative peptide drug TP508 given 24 hours after a
      potentially-lethal exposure to radiation appears to significantly
      increase survival and delay mortality in mice by counteracting
      damage to the gastrointestinal system.<br>
      <br>
      The threat of a nuclear incident, with the potential to kill or
      injure thousands of people, has raised global awareness about the
      need for medical countermeasures that can prevent
      radiation-induced bodily damage and keep people alive, even if
      given a day or more after contact with nuclear radiation.<br>
      <br>
      Exposure to high doses of radiation triggers a number of
      potentially lethal effects. Among the most severe of these effects
      is the gastrointestinal, or GI, toxicity syndrome that is caused
      by radiation-induced destruction of the intestinal lining. This
      type of GI damage decreases the ability of the body to absorb
      water and causes electrolyte imbalances, bacterial infection,
      intestinal leakage, sepsis and death.<br>
      <br>
      The GI toxicity syndrome is triggered by radiation-induced damage
      to crypt cells in the small intestines and colon that must
      continuously replenish in order for the GI tract to work properly.
      Crypt cells are especially susceptible to radiation damage and
      serve as an indicator of whether someone will survive after total
      body radiation exposure.<br>
      <br>
      "The lack of available treatments that can effectively protect
      against radiation-induced damage has prompted a search for
      countermeasures that can minimize the effects of radiation after
      exposure, accelerate tissue repair in radiation-exposed
      individuals and increase the chances for survival following a
      nuclear event," said Darrell Carney, UTMB adjunct professor in
      biochemistry and molecular biology and CEO of Chrysalis
      BioTherapeutics, Inc. "Because radiation-induced damage to the
      intestines plays such a key role in how well a person recovers
      from radiation exposure, it's crucial to develop novel medications
      capable of preventing GI damage."<br>
      <br>
      The peptide drug TP508 was developed for use in stimulating repair
      of skin, bone and muscle tissues. It has previously been shown to
      begin tissue repair by stimulating proper blood flow, reducing
      inflammation and reducing cell death. In human clinical trials,
      the drug has been reported to increase healing of diabetic foot
      ulcers and wrist fractures with no drug-related adverse events.<br>
      <br>
      "The current results suggest that the peptide may be an effective
      emergency nuclear countermeasure that could be delivered within 24
      hours after exposure to increase survival and delay mortality,
      giving victims time to reach facilities for advanced medical
      treatment," Kantara said.<br>

      </b><b>Abstract</b><br>
      <br>
      In recent years, increasing threats of radiation exposure and
      nuclear disasters have become a significant concern for the United
      States and countries worldwide. Exposure to high doses of
      radiation triggers a number of potentially lethal effects. Among
      the most severe is the gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity syndrome
      caused by the destruction of the intestinal barrier, resulting in
      bacterial translocation, systemic bacteremia, sepsis, and death.
      The lack of effective radioprotective agents capable of mitigating
      radiation-induced damage has prompted a search for novel
      countermeasures that can mitigate the effects of radiation post
      exposure, accelerate tissue repair in radiation-exposed
      individuals, and prevent mortality. We report that a single
      injection of regenerative peptide TP508 (rusalatide acetate,
      Chrysalin) 24?h after lethal radiation exposure (9?Gy, LD100/15)
      appears to significantly increase survival and delay mortality by
      mitigating radiation-induced intestinal and colonic toxicity.
      TP508 treatment post exposure prevents the disintegration of GI
      crypts, stimulates the expression of adherens junction protein
      E-cadherin, activates crypt cell proliferation, and decreases
      apoptosis. TP508 post-exposure treatment also upregulates the
      expression of DCLK1 and LGR5 markers of stem cells that have been
      shown to be responsible for maintaining and regenerating
      intestinal crypts. Thus, TP508 appears to mitigate the effects of
      GI toxicity by activating radioresistant stem cells and increasing
      the stemness potential of crypts to maintain and restore
      intestinal integrity. These results suggest that TP508 may be an
      effective emergency nuclear countermeasure that could be delivered
      within 24?h post exposure to increase survival and delay
      mortality, giving victims time to reach clinical sites for
      advanced medical treatment.<br>

      It sounds like a strange combination: zinc oxide crystals, water,
      and noise pollution. But scientists at the University of
      Wisconsin-Madison have discovered that the mix can efficiently
      produce hydrogen without the need for a dirty catalyst like oil.
      By submerging a new type of zinc oxide crystal in water, the
      scientists claim to be able to harvest hydrogen using vibrations
      from passing traffic and crashing waves.<br>
      <br>
      To generate the clean hydrogen, researchers produced zinc oxide
      crystals that absorb vibrations when placed in water. The
      vibrations cause the crystals to develop areas with strong
      positive and negative charges–a reaction that rips the surrounding
      water molecules and releases hydrogen and oxygen.<br>
      <br>
      The mechanism, dubbed the piezoelectrochemical effect, converts
      18% of energy from vibrations into hydrogen gas (compared to 10%
      from conventional piezoelectric materials). And since any
      vibration can produce the effect, the system could one day be used
      to generate power from anything that produces noise — cars
      whizzing by on the highway, crashing waves in the ocean, or planes
      landing at an airport. That sounds like a good deal to us!<br>

      direct conversion of mechanical energy to chemical energy. This
      phenomenon is further applied for generating hydrogen and oxygen
      via direct water decomposition by means of as-synthesized
      piezoelectric ZnO microfibers and BaTiO3 microdendrites. Fibers
      and dendrites are vibrated with ultrasonic waves leading to a
      strain-induced electric charge development on their surface. With
      sufficient electric potential, strained piezoelectric fibers (and
      dendrites) in water triggered the redox reaction of water to
      produce hydrogen and oxygen gases. ZnO fibers under ultrasonic
      vibrations showed a stoichiometric ratio of H2/O2 (2:1) initial
      gas production from pure water. This study provides a simple and
      cost-effective technology for direct water splitting that may
      generate hydrogen fuels by scavenging energy wastes such as noise
      or stray vibrations from the environment. This new discovery may
      have potential implications in solving the challenging energy and
      environmental issues that we are facing today and in the future.<br>

      In several years - in perhaps decades, or maybe never - our
      computers, nanoantennas and other kinds of equipment could operate
      on the base of photons, rather than electrons. Even now we are
      practically prepared to accomplish this switch. If it happens, the
      spheres studied by an international group of Russian, French and
      Spanish scientists will definitely be able to become one of the
      elementary components of new photonic devices...<br>

      From the center of the sphere illuminated by an electromagnetic
      wave we draw a line in any fixed direction. Along this line we lay
      off a segment, whose length equals to the intensity of the
      radiation scattered by the sphere in this direction. Thus, we get
      a point in a 3-dimensional space. If we do that for any possible
      directions, the set of these points forms a surface. Now it is
      easy, using this surface, to determine the intensity of the
      radiation scattered in any given direction. These surfaces are
      shown in the figure. The parameter q is proportional to the
      frequency of the incident wave. It is seen clearly that small
      changes in q lead to a dramatic restructuring of the
      directionality of the scattered radiation. Credit: Tribelsky et

      </b><b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      To progress from the laboratory to commercial applications, it
      will be necessary to develop industrially scalable methods to
      produce large quantities of defect-free graphene. Here we show
      that high-shear mixing of graphite in suitable stabilizing liquids
      results in large-scale exfoliation to give dispersions of graphene
      nanosheets. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Raman
      spectroscopy show the exfoliated flakes to be unoxidized and free
      of basal-plane defects. We have developed a simple model that
      shows exfoliation to occur once the local shear rate exceeds 104
      s-1. By fully characterizing the scaling behaviour of the graphene
      production rate, we show that exfoliation can be achieved in
      liquid volumes from hundreds of millilitres up to hundreds of
      litres and beyond. The graphene produced by this method performs
      well in applications from composites to conductive coatings. This
      method can be applied to exfoliate BN, MoS2 and a range of other
      layered crystals.<br>

      </div>
      <br>
      Scientists have discovered a process to turn cancer cells back
      into normal cells by restoring the balance of key molecules
      controlling specific cellular functions.<br>
      <br>
      A group of researchers from the Mayo Clinic carried out the
      research published in the journal Nature: Cell Biology on Monday.<br>
      <br>
      Utilizing the new method in laboratory experiments, the team was
      able to successfully “reprogram” the out-of-control growth of the
      cells which would become cancerous. The team noted that further
      research is required in order to determine if the process would be
      applicable in human cells.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
      Dr. Panos Anastasiadis (L) and Dr. Antonis Kourtidis (Mayo Clinic)<br>
      <br>
      "The study brings together two so-far unrelated research fields --
      cell-to-cell adhesion and miRNA biology,” said Dr. Antonis
      Kourtidis from the Mayo Clinic.<br>
      <br>
      The teams discovered that a protein called PLEKHA7 maintains
      cell’s normal growth and state with the use of micro RNAs, or
      miRNA. A decline in PLEKHA7 levels results in the misregulation of
      miRNAs that turn cadherin and p120 catenin from good to bad.<br>
      <br>
      Based on the experiments reported in the study, if the miRNA in
      cancer cells is increased back to normal levels, the proteins also
      turn from bad to good which make cancer growth stop.<br>
      <br>
      "By administering the affected miRNAs in cancer cells to restore
      their normal levels, we should be able to re-establish the brakes
      and restore normal cell function," said Dr. Panos Anastasiadis,
      director of the department of cancer biology at Mayo's
      Jacksonville campus. "Initial experiments in some aggressive types
      of cancer are indeed very promising."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>

      on, which is extremely unlikely ( I'm not familiar with the
      various syntheses of LAH, but there is almost no chance that such

            Eating to Lose 62% More Fat</b></big><br>
        <b>And where you can find it</b><br>
        <br>
        <b>Christina Sarich</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      There are far too many fad diets out there that skimp on real
      nutrition, and worse, sell pre-packaged foods that are called ‘low
      fat’ when they also include GMOs, MSG, and a host of artificial
      colors and flavors. Aside, from simply detoxing your body so that
      you can lose weight safely, research shows that eating more
      protein, and specifically one amino acid in particular, can boost
      your metabolic rate 3 times more than eating a diet high in fat
      and simple carbs.<br>
      <br>
      Some think it is as simple as calories in, calories out to lose
      weight – meaning what you eat in excess, you have to work hard to
      lose. But weight loss and maintenance isn’t always that simple,
      and it doesn’t always work like that. For example, numerous
      studies have shown that eating more protein can really boost
      weight loss, and the body doesn’t recognize ‘calories’ as we have
      defined them up until now.<br>
      <br>
      This works, in part, because protein takes longer to digest, and
      can significantly curb hunger cravings. Protein can also help to
      balance blood glucose and lipid levels, too. Even better, you
      don’t need to consume protein that is from animals; even
      vegetarians can boost their protein intake to find good results.
      (You just need to know some good vegetarian protein sources.)<br>
      <br>
      What is a fairly new discovery in the ‘eat more protein’ camp is
      that a specific amino acid does a lot of the fat burning for you.
      This amino acid is called leucine. It helps to prevent the loss of
      muscle when you are losing fat, as well as helps to retain muscle
      that is normally lost due to aging. You may know that muscle burns
      more than fat, so it is very important to retain muscle when you
      are trying to slim down.<br>
      <br>
      In one peer-reviewed study, participants lost twice as much weight
      when taking a leucine supplement as those who were given a
      placebo. Yet another study published in PLOS found a significant
      effect on adipose tissue (fat cells) when the amino acid leucine
      was given to mice.<br>
      <br>
      One of the simplest and most effective tricks to losing weight may
      be to increase your protein intake, but to make sure you are
      eating enough leucine. The amino acid leucine can be found in the
      following foods:<br>
      Egg Whites &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4233 mg<br>
      Organic Soy Protein Isolate &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4226 mg<br>

      <br>
      A series of technical events have already taken place which has
      caused massive losses in the US stock market..<br>
      <br>
      And it appears that this is about to get much worse.<br>
      <br>
      Have a look at this chart segment below.<br>
      <br>
      This chart demonstrates the price action of the Dow Jones
      Industrial Average since the market top in May.<br>

      <br>
      Two critical events have already occurred, and a third appears to
      be just weeks away.<br>
      <br>
      Take notice to the first white circle 1.<br>
      <br>
      This technical event occurred when the yellow 50 day moving
      average crossed the blue 100 day moving average. Several days
      after this event occurred, downward pressure on the market
      intensified.<br>
      <br>
      Now take notice to the second white circle 2.<br>
      <br>
      In this technical event the yellow 50 day moving average crossed
      the red 200 day moving average, and just a few days later stocks
      plunged.<br>
      <br>
      Now look at circle 3.<br>
      <br>
      The yellow 50 day moving average appears to be closing in on the
      purple 300 day moving average.<br>
      <br>
      It is my contention that when this event occurs, and it appears to
      be just weeks away, a MAJOR stock market event will occur. We can
      expect a massive loss in the value of stocks, one which has the
      potential to be the financial event of our lifetime.<br>
      <br>
      **Unless something intervenes, perhaps another technical
      occurrence which prevents this 3rd technical event from happening,
      we may be just weeks away from financial Armageddon.<br>

            Israeli Mystical Rabbi, Warns of Imminent War</b></big><br>
        <br>
        <b>By <br>
          <br>
          Rivkah Lambert Adler</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      For three and a half hours this past Saturday night, Rabbi Amram
      Vaknin, a 76-year-old Israeli mystic, fell to the floor as he
      received a warning from the next world.<br>
      <br>
      From approximately 9 PM until 12:30 AM, in his modest home in the
      port city of Ashdod, Rabbi Vaknin was cautioned that war is coming
      to Israel very soon, the rabbi’s student revealed to Breaking
      Israel News.<br>
      <br>
      The most recent revelation from Heaven was given over to the rabbi
      from a small group, including the prophet Elijah and his own
      deceased rabbi, Rabbi Moshe Zrihan, along with Rabbi Vaknin’s
      father and grandmother.<br>
      <br>
      As previously reported by Breaking Israel News, Rabbi Vaknin
      receives periodic messages from the Next World, warning about
      events in Israel. Gil Nachman, a close student of Rabbi Vaknin’s,
      told Breaking Israel News, “Pray that it’s not going to be today,
      tomorrow or in two weeks.”<br>
      <br>
      Nachman recounted the specifics that Rabbi Vaknin received in the
      message. “The Muslims are going to contaminate the water, the
      fruits and vegetables.They are going to damage the electricity,”
      he said. “And there are going to be people dying in the streets,
      thousands of people all over Israel.”<br>
      <br>
      Nachman urged that the Israeli water company, the electric company
      and food importers should be prepared for these attacks.<br>
      <br>
      According to Nachman, Rabbi Vaknin was told that Arab citizen of
      Israel and Member of Knesset Hanin Zoabi is the one planning it.
      Vaknin stated his belief that Zoabi is a spy for ISIS and Hamas
      and is providing the terror groups all the information they need
      to plan the attacks.<br>
      <br>
      Why is this happening? According to Nachman, it is because the
      leaders of the generation “don’t want to do teshuva (to repent).
      They aren’t waking up. Hashem (God) wants to lead them in the
      right path. We all need to do teshuva.”<br>
      <br>
      Nachman said that in the past, Jewish leaders such as Moses and
      King David knew about decrees against the Jewish people before
      they happened. These great leaders took it upon themselves to
      repent first, but the leaders of today are telling others to
      repent without doing it themselves.<br>
      <br>
      “Our weapon is not Tzahal (IDF), not Netanyahu, nobody. Only
      teshuva,” Nachman urgently told Breaking Israel News.<br>
      <br>
      When asked what Rabbi Vaknin said people should concentrate their
      repentance on, Nachman mentioned four things. Repent for “the
      inner sins that you hide away from people and the sins that people
      see. And kibud av v’eim (honoring your father and mother) is one
      of the most important things. And always say the truth of what’s
      in your heart. Be real. It’s all about emet (truth).”<br>
      <br>
      “The war is very close. We have no choice. The teshuva of Am
      Yisrael (the Jewish nation) will determine the rachamim (mercy).
      But war is definitely coming,” Nachman insisted. “We beg Am
      Yisrael to do teshuva as soon as possible, because we don’t want
      to see people dying. Stop thinking about material things. That’s
      not going to give you life. When Moshiach (Messiah) comes,
      material is not going to mean anything to anybody.”<br>
      <br>
      “We’re getting close to the big day of Moshiach. Before that
      happens, Hashem wants us to do teshuva. We have to be ready and
      prepared,” pleaded Nachman. “When we do real teshuva, Hashem will
      fight for us.”<br>
      <br>
      Nachman concluded by recounting a teaching from the Talmud, the
      primary source of Judaism’s rabbinic tradition. The eagle
      approaches his baby eaglets in the nest very slowly. He makes sure
      that they notice him gradually, so as not to shock them, because
      they can die from such fear. Similarly, God does not want to hurt
      us. He’s warning us to wake up because He’s about to rule the
      world, so He’s warning us little by little, in order that we
      recognize His approach. Every earthquake, every terrorist
      incident, every battle, is a warning to wake up.<br>
      <br>
      Through previous messages from Heaven, Rabbi Vaknin accurately
      predicted the “Gaza Freedom Flotilla” in May, 2010, the deadly
      fire in the Carmel forest in December of 2010 as well as Operation
      Pillar of Defense in 2012 and Operation Protective Edge in 2014.<br>

        "><b>http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=pharmacy</b></a><b><br>

      </b><br>
      <b>pharmacy (n.) </b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      late 14c., "a medicine," from Old French farmacie "a purgative"
      (13c.), from Medieval Latin pharmacia, from Greek pharmakeia "use
      of drugs, medicines, potions, or spells; poisoning, witchcraft;
      remedy, cure," from pharmakeus (fem. pharmakis) "preparer of
      drugs, poisoner, sorcerer" from pharmakon "drug, poison, philter,
      charm, spell, enchantment." Meaning "use or administration of
      drugs" is attested from c. 1400; that of "place where drugs are
      prepared and dispensed" is first recorded 1833. The ph- was
      restored 16c. in French, 17c. in English (see ph).<br>

      <br>
      Has the ISIS psyop calmed down a bit? Before it dies out let’s
      examine some incredible ironies and oddities surrounding CIA’s
      ISIS. After all, the ISIS psyop deserves a thorough analysis from
      every angle, so I thought it appropriate to outline for the sake
      of humanity. Hopefully, humanity can use the ISIS psyop as a tool
      for the final or further awakening. It may be wishful thinking,
      but it is worth exposing every crack and corner of this psyop and
      let government know that we are not going for it this time.<br>
      <br>
      I declare humanity too intuitive to buy into this psychological
      operation and hopefully I’m right. So while the core TV-watching,
      mainstream media-believing community drinks the government Kool
      Aid, let us get started by pointing out several glaring
      observations regarding the ISIS psyop.<br>
      <br>
      Glancing ahead, the ISIS kids have knowledge of things that
      require you to have education, modern technical skills, a little
      bit of decency, structure, conformity to societal norms and
      somewhat transparent connection to the outside world. What are
      these things and what are some of the surreal oddities surrounding
      ISIS? Let’s examine:<br>
      <br>
      <b>1. Professional Camera, Editing Software and Skills</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Incredibly, despite being savages that only want to kill for
      apparently no specific burning reason other than that fact that
      you are not ISIS, ISIS has at least some kind of production
      department that can skillfully provide what could be considered
      Hollywood-style editing (of supposed beheading videos) with
      multiple camera angles, consistent daylight on their subjects and
      proper daylight mode video exposure. They clearly have the skills
      for setting up multiple cameras and using those precise angles for
      their production department. In order to put out these supposed
      beheading videos, they also had to make sure that the sounds were
      just right and that there was no shaking of the camera.<br>
      <br>
      Someone then had to take the various video angles and properly
      edit the footage so as to make it look professional. The editor,
      apparently a man of class and decency, then is careful not to show
      any actual action and blood. Savage killers who are ALSO
      respectful and classy about being too disturbing with their
      videos. Instead they courteously (but sloppily) cut from the early
      hand action of their British-sounding supposed lead man, to the
      post beheading amazingly clean shot of a head sitting on a corpse
      with the classic Photoshop drop shadows. In Hollywood style,
      reminiscent of Alfred Hitchcock films, the editor essentially
      leaves the action to the viewer’s imagination. Even though this
      beheading movie created by ISIS is not being submitted for any
      film festivals, they carefully comply with techniques that would
      make this film fully acceptable into almost any gore film
      festival.<br>
      <br>
      To those who want to point out to viewers the amazing lack of
      blood during those first critical throat slices of James Foley’s
      neck, sorry, exposing this lack of blood is in itself apparently
      too grotesque by YouTube standards and should you post such a
      video it will be conveniently removed.<br>
      <br>
      <b>2. Professional Image Editing Software and Skills.</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Like the editing software, the ISIS production team shows off
      their skills in Photoshop image editing software, which often
      requires an extended learning period, resources, and practice.
      Despite a few imperfections, the ISIS production department seems
      to know how to cut and splice out sections of images to produce
      the desired effect of disconnecting a head from the body. Even if
      obtaining and using the software is believable, let’s remember
      we’re talking about savage “terrorists” that are supposedly
      inhumane. In other words, these are clinically, factually
      documented psychopaths and not your average person according to
      government legend. Let’s keep this in mind (psychopaths) when
      speaking about ISIS.<br>
      <b><br>
        3. Internet Connection, Video Uploading Capabilities, and Social
        Media Accounts.</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      According to U.S. “intelligence sources” mouthpieces, ISIS has all
      the above including social media capabilities. Amazingly, these
      covered-face killers have unraveled the secret of how to outsmart
      every world power including the U.S. Empire with regard to every
      form of communication. They have stomped out the U.S. military,
      NSA, CIA, NATO, U.N. and the intelligence of Israel, U.K. and
      every other nation that surrounds them. You may think it’s not
      every day that a small group of young face-covered kids can
      outsmart the world, but this could be attributed to pure luck if
      you believe in the ISIS psyop. Just to be able to say that you’ve
      outsmarted the U.S. Empire 13 years after they accelerated their
      plans to rule the world outlined in The Project for the New
      American Century document titled “Rebuilding America’s Defenses.”
      According to the ISIS psyop, that accomplishment alone is worthy
      of historic recognition.<br>
      <br>
      Here’s a group of young kids with covered faces who maintain
      Internet accounts without any past due balances, they have wide
      open social media accounts (Facebook? YouTube? Twitter?) that are
      also apparently well maintained. They must understand and be
      properly following the rules of these social media accounts. But
      wait, if they have social media accounts doesn’t that mean that
      the social media providers are terrorists too? Unless these
      geniuses called ISIS are also fooling them as well. I suppose this
      would be realistic according to the&nbsp; government narrative
      since ISIS has apparently outsmarted everyone else.<br>
      <br>
      Okay, forget social media, how is ISIS able to log on to the
      Internet? Do they have their own ISIS hackers?? Who do they pay
      their Internet bill with? Without Internet aren’t they lost? No
      social media and no way of knowing what is going on right? I doubt
      they have analog TV in their convoys? Doesn’t this present a
      communication problem? ISIS again quietly has overcome this
      problem in a flawless and mysterious manner.<br>
      <br>
      <b>4. ISIS Intelligence Operation Apparently Far Superior to
        CIA/Mossad</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Amazingly this group of geniuses who have outsmarted the entire
      global intelligence community seem to have all the capabilities to
      put the U.S. Empire’s CIA and their globalist partner Israel’s
      Mossad to shame. ISIS has put on a clinic and has officially
      handed the U.S. and Israel their butts in the intelligence
      department. They not only formed right below their noses, they did
      it quickly, they figured out unanimously what their mission would
      be and all agreed on it. Football teams and all sports team for
      that matter throughout the world could learn from ISIS. ISIS
      apparently is teaching the world how a team works together.
      Imagine, the CIA’s mainstream media would have us believe that
      ISIS is powerful and high in numbers. Really? How would you get
      that many people to agree on anything? Every NCAA coach would
      learn a lot from ISIS. Here’s a group of young face-covered men
      who actually agree on everything. They even all agree not to
      attack Israel for no reason at all.<br>
      <br>
      How quickly ISIS rose to power and fame and how they operate in
      such unity should strike everyone as very odd, yet the ISIS psyop
      narrative continues without missing a beat in regards to these
      technicalities and finer points. Any way we slice it, the ISIS
      psyop narratives has a group of kids with hidden faces who have
      revolutionized the concept of the “intelligence” operation. They
      solved the CIA Mossad and NSA problems and now are laughing at the
      global intelligence community. They did this at a time, by the
      way, even as uncharged innocent prisoners sit in George W Bush’s
      Guantanamo illegal prison for life. Can you imagine what is going
      on in the minds of the men in Guantanamo hearing about ISIS?<br>

        Identities of Their Members</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Have you noticed that no one knows who ISIS is? What are their
      names? Why not snag up one or two of them and let the identities
      come out? No, not ONE member of ISIS is capturable or identified
      to the world. It’s like they never existed. Not one wife, sister,
      brother, father, cousin, nephew, aunt, or uncle is speaking out.
      Apparently they never lived anywhere and never told their friends
      that they were going to join ISIS. Not one of the has a girlfriend
      or a spouse that would have spoken by now. No one has come out
      testifying that ISIS tried recruiting them. Oddly, we haven’t even
      heard of an angry former girlfriend speaking out about the initial
      call, the recruiting effort or anything whatsoever. But without a
      powerful recruiting effort how did they recruit? Somehow they got
      around this one too. No one knows how. They simply came into
      being. Let that sink in. <br>
      <br>
      <b>6. Anti Surveillance Technology- Able to Avoid All Existing
        Surveillance</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      In the age of super advanced government biometric surveillance,
      tracking and spying, ISIS has one less problem than anyone in
      America. Unlike Americans who are constantly under the threat of
      being surveilled and spied on by the U.S. empire, ISIS lives free
      of the threat of technological surveillance of any kind. For some
      reason, their images, faces, voices and actions are not
      surveilled, tracked or recorded by those who can do it.<br>
      <br>
      “Intelligence sources” are powerless in the face of ISIS. All of
      the U.S.’s NASA, NSA and USAF technology and equipment makes no
      difference when it’s ISIS. Despite all this, amazingly we hear
      nothing about the U.S. military or NSA trying to steal or decode
      the ISIS counter surveillance technology. Oddly, the topic of
      ISIS’s amazing counter-surveillance technological abilities is not
      talked about by anyone in the media or in Washington. <br>
      <br>
      <b>7. Endless Secret Water, Food, Farming and Meals Supply</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Anyone who has served in the military knows that being a soldier
      makes you hungry. ISIS fighters definitely require lots of food
      and drinks that keep their energy up. You can’t go around killing
      people just for not being part of ISIS without having plenty of
      energy and lots of water and drinks. Even in the military, working
      in the mess hall for some was a career. Why? Because someone has
      to do it.<br>
      <br>
      When I was in the military I remember the supply specialists;
      their full time job was tagging along on our field trips, making
      sure the unit had enough food and water. When necessary, the
      supply guys had to go to work to make sure everything went smooth.
      So where is ISIS getting their supplies? Who’s feeding them with
      food and water? Do they also own the farms? Do they grow their own
      food? Amazingly, according to the ISIS psyop they do. Or perhaps
      their food and water suppliers are all part of a secret operation
      being hidden by the world’s new leader of counter intelligence,
      ISIS. And speaking of supplies, who’s supplying their actual
      bullets? Ammunition? Guns without ammo are useless, so the
      question is where are they getting their bullets from?<br>
      <br>
      <b>8. All American Timing! – Common Enemies, Lucky Gift</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      ISIS is a unique group from which almost all their goals fit in
      perfectly with the Bush Neocon plans to militarily control the
      world. I covered this topic in a recent article. Amazingly, ISIS
      now happens to hate Russia, too, just like the United States. What
      are the odds? Bush Neocons controlling Obama and the globalists
      benefit greatly from more, not less, terrorism. An end to the War
      on Terror would leave the U.S. without the planned conquering of
      Syria and Iran and re-conquering Iraq. Without a bogeymonster like
      ISIS to provide the pretext for invading these countries (in some
      cases, again) the plan has no legs. That ISIS fits in perfectly
      with the Bush Neocon plans is merely a coincidence according to
      the ISIS psyop narrative. Like Lucky Larry Silverstein taking the
      day off only on 9/11/01 to go to an appointment after never
      missing work for years if ever at all. Luck, the narrators of the
      ISIS psyop would have you believe, is something that just happens
      and should be accepted without question.<br>
      <br>
      But wait, ISIS is so close to Israel, they may attack Israel any
      given day. Given how fast they move, how well they operate
      together, their skillful blend of technology and brute force
      surely they could cause a historic massacre in Israel overnight
      and leave their trail of blood through large sections of Israel.
      Isn’t that the stated goal of ISIS? IDF and Mossad have already
      failed to detect or stop ISIS in any way shape or form so I
      wouldn’t expect them to provide much of a challenge for the ISIS
      powerhouse terror group. Given how brave they are, I would imagine
      they wouldn’t have any problems getting the young men to volunteer
      for the big Israel attack.<br>
      <br>
      The big Israel attack would gain them all the PR and Marketing
      they need. Isn’t that the goal when someone opens up a social
      media account? Hasn’t ISIS demonstrated in the supposed beheading
      videos that they are serious, they want everyone to know who they
      are and they want certain things? An attack on Israel would get
      them everything they want; yet, for another lucky reason (luck of
      the U.S. and Israel) ISIS doesn’t seem motivated about pulling off
      the big damage/low-cost attack on Israel.<br>
      <br>
      The irony gets even crazier here. According to U.S. politicians
      pushing the ISIS psyop narrative, ISIS is not only unwilling to
      attack Israel, which they could do in a day or two, they instead
      prefer to make plans to travel all the way to the other side of
      the world to attack the world’s most powerful Empire of all time.
      Yes, they would rather risk getting caught, imprisoned or killed
      traveling halfway around the world than to go for an easy quick
      strike at Israel. And, for good measure, as if to flaunt their
      super counter-intelligence capabilities, they are willing to
      announce ahead of time their travel plans to fly halfway across
      the world to attack American cities.<br>
      <br>
      So this previously incredible intelligence organization that
      outsmarted all of the world’s intelligence agencies at once, is
      now giving away their plans before they even happen. Doesn’t that
      sound like a monumental change in intelligence strategy from such
      a stellar counter-intelligence skilled violent organization?
      Apparently in the “new” ISIS philosophy they now give away their
      plans ahead of time knowing that NOT giving away their plans
      worked pretty well during their secret and rapid rise to power
      under everyone’s noses. Keep in mind ISIS uses U.S. military gear
      which they accidentally “found” in Iraq. The military gear –
      including tanks, artillery weapons and high-powered guns – all
      just happened to work perfectly, and for good measure they
      apparently have all the ammunition to go with these weapons.<br>
      <br>
      But wait, you might say, how can ISIS transport huge military
      equipment to the U.S. for an attack? Not one U.S. “intelligence
      source” seems to know the answer to this. Apparently ISIS is not
      just lucky like lucky Larry, they also have a lot of money (that
      no one seems to know the origin of) and they are very versatile.
      The ISIS engineers are apparently working on brand new smaller,
      easier to hide weapons that are not detectable by airport scanners
      or surveillance cameras. Is ISIS starting to sound like James Bond
      yet?<br>
      <br>
      <b>9. Complete Ongoing Immunity and Hidden Identities</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Amazingly, ISIS is unknown to anyone (as mentioned in number 6).
      Even if their database is never discovered, ISIS is skilled at
      knowing when to wear their masks. I mean, you wouldn’t want to be
      caught without your mask right? And if you are caught without your
      mask and someone videotapes you, does that mean they kill you? No
      big deal? How does that work? One thing we know is that ISIS thus
      far (and they have been around allegedly a few years) has been
      perfect at hiding their faces. Not ONE video or photo exists where
      one member of ISIS showed his face. Amazing? Yes, for a group that
      has regular social media and Internet access. Where are the images
      of these men that belong to ISIS and why hide your face anyway?
      This amazing stroke of luck of not having even one member show his
      face or having his identity known to the world is an amazing
      accomplishment given all the technology and media available as
      mentioned before.<br>
      <br>
      With this ongoing face-hiding playing out to perfection, once
      again ISIS is schooling the world on how to be a criminal in the
      face of the global police state and get away with it. Do you
      realize someone you know or someone they know could be part of
      ISIS without anyone knowing? Is ISIS really Blackwater? Academi?
      You know, the U.S.’s private mercenary organization that likes to
      change its name all the time. Is this the reason why “ISIS” covers
      their face? Even James Bond could not successfully hide his
      identity for very long and he’s just one person. Remember, we’re
      talking about supposedly thousands if not tens of thousands of
      young men working as one without one of these men making a
      mistake. Try to imagine how ridiculous this really sounds.
      Ultimately, as long as secrecy of the faces of ISIS is maintained,
      we really don’t know for sure just who ISIS really is. We know
      what the federal government would have us think, but humanity as a
      whole is now moving past this type of solution for procurement of
      legitimate information.<br>
      <br>
      <b>10. Untraceable Money and Endless Spending</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Yes, according to government mouthpiece “experts” like Colonel
      Anthony Shaffer and others, we (the U.S. “intelligence sources”)
      know a lot about ISIS. They have money, they are organized, etc.
      But think about it, how come they “know” so much about ISIS’s
      financial abilities but don’t “know” who funded them or what bank
      accounts they currently have?? U.S. and its allies’ intelligence
      only “know” enough to scare you with ISIS but not enough to act to
      actually stop their banking activity. That would actually stop
      ISIS dead in its tracks wouldn’t it? But nope, we don’t want ISIS
      to go away too quickly. The script needs to play out doesn’t it?<br>
      <br>
      This script is indeed playing out, and America and the world is
      the audience watching the show. Those that are awakened stand in
      dismay at the level of propaganda we are seeing and are wondering
      what ridiculous narrative will the globalists spin next to get
      into Syria and continue into Iran? Others who wanted to believe
      mainstream media news but perhaps are intuitive enough to not be
      fooled yet again are scratching their head. We call that The WTF
      Moment.<br>
      <br>
      While sadly others have seen this script before and for some
      reason they kind of liked it before. Perhaps they love the
      post-9/11 feeling of believing government and looking to it for
      protection from terrorism. Perhaps they love the police state and
      maybe they are comfortable being surveilled 24/7. Perhaps they
      know that the only way to maintain their sanity and their lifelong
      and hard-fought-for paradigm is to simply believe whatever
      mainstream media news says. This third group will welcome the CIA
      script.<br>
      <br>
      It is this group (those that welcome the mainstream media script)
      that makes this next (information war) chess game between
      humanity’s awakened segment and humanity’s governing segment very
      interesting. This third (asleep) segment of humanity is playing
      out the last bit of fantasy left in their personal paradigms. Some
      of them would probably rather die than face reality. Some of them
      think they are “saving” themselves from reality. Reality, with
      some of these people, thus takes on the role of sin in that they
      want to save themselves from this consciousness. For others the
      same reality takes on a role of “insanity”. The goal thus becomes
      to “preserve” their consciousness from this “insanity” or tin
      foil, crazy, lunatic, “conspiracy theories”- you get the picture.<br>
      <br>
      That is how the ISIS psyop divides itself upon humanity.
      Recognizing the three primary forms of consciousness will help us
      arrive at a consensus on how to move forward to fix this problem.
      Let’s hope that we (humanity) can figure it out quickly this time
      and with the fewest amount of lost lives. Let us pray for humanity
      and for the survival of the human race. Let’s remember that all
      those logos, flags, ideologies, and concepts of governments are
      all just artificial agreements. Let’s all try to see the biggest
      picture, which is that we are all part of a species (humanity)
      which is actually trying to kill itself off. Let’s not let tiny
      individual samples of our own species ruin it for all of us.
      They’ve tried everything they have, so they have to start
      repeating their tactics. They are making the script easier for us
      all. Let’s take advantage of this weakness they are showing. The
      weakness of lack of creativity. This lack of creativity is
      glaringly obvious to all of us now. The globalists are not very
      creative and they like to repeat their tactics. This is why
      history is a great tool to expose the globalists and their new
      world order.<br>
      <br>
      Its been said and I declare again that those who ignore the
      lessons of history are bound to repeat it; never has this been
      more true than today. Here’s a word of caution to those who still
      believe government’s ongoing War on Terror. Look at the past, look
      at attacks of 9/11/01, don’t you agree it didn’t work out very
      well for us? And on top of that they took all our liberties away.
      This is a failed government. Are you going to trust them at a game
      where you are always the loser? Ask yourself, how did their phony
      war on terror improve your life last time? Why would this next
      round of ISIS be expected to be any different? Don’t you want to
      thrive while you are alive? Then let go of government-engineered
      lies and narratives and see the greater agenda now for yourself.

      Even the formerly august New York Times grants that Donald J.
      Trump has ignited a voter firestorm of grievance against a dumb
      show election process that rewards a craven avoidance of real
      issues. Immigration is actually a stand-in for the paralysis,
      incompetence, overreach, and bloatedness of government generally
      in our time — but it is a good doorway into the larger problem.<br>
      <br>
      Immigration is a practical problem, with visible effects
      on-the-ground, easy to understand. I’m enjoying the Trump-provoked
      debate mostly because it is a pushback against the disgusting
      dishonesty of political correctness that has bogged down the
      educated classes in a swamp of sentimentality. For instance, Times
      Sunday Magazine staffer Emily Bazelon wrote a polemic last week
      inveighing against the use of the word “illegal” applied to people
      who cross the border without permission on the grounds that it
      “justifies their mistreatment.” One infers she means that sending
      them back where they came from equals mistreatment.<br>
      <br>
      It’s refreshing that Trump is able to cut through this kind of
      tendentious crap. If that were his only role, it would be a good
      one, because political correctness is an intellectual disease that
      is making it impossible for even educated people to think —
      especially people who affect to be political leaders. Trump’s
      fellow Republicans are entertainingly trapped in their own
      cowardliness and it’s fun to watch them squirm.<br>
      <br>
      But for me, everything else about Trump is frankly sickening, from
      his sneering manner of speech, to the worldview he reveals day by
      day, to the incoherence of his rhetoric, to the wolverine that
      lives on top of his head. The thought of Trump actually getting
      elected makes me wonder where Arthur Bremer is when we really need
      him.<br>
      <br>
      Did any of you actually catch Trump’s performance last week at the
      so-called “town meeting” event in New Hampshire (really just a
      trumped-up pep rally)? I don’t think I miscounted that Trump told
      the audience he was “very smart” 23 times in the course of his
      remarks. If he really was smart, he would know that such tedious
      assertions only suggest he is deeply insecure about his own
      intelligence. After all, this is a man whose lifework has been
      putting up giant buildings that resemble bowling trophies, some of
      them in the service of one of the worst activities of our time,
      legalized gambling, which is based on the socially pernicious idea
      that it’s possible to get something for nothing.<br>
      <br>
      I daresay that legalized gambling has had a possibly worse effect
      on American life the past three decades than illegal immigration.
      Gambling is a marginal activity for marginal people that belongs
      on the margins — the back rooms and back alleys. It was consigned
      there for decades because it was understood that it’s not healthy
      for the public to believe that it’s possible to get something for
      nothing, that it undermines perhaps the most fundamental principle
      of human life.<br>
      <br>
      Trump’s verbal incoherence is really something to behold. He’s
      incapable of expressing a complete thought without venturing down
      a dendritic maze of digressions, often leading to an assertion of
      how much he is loved (another sign of insecurity). For example,
      when he attacked Jeb’s (no last name necessary) statement that we
      have to show Iraqi leaders that “we have skin in the game,” Trump
      invoked the “wounded warriors,” saying “I love them. They’re
      everywhere. They love me.” In the immortal words of Tina Turner,
      “what’s love got to do with it?”<br>
      <br>
      Trump’s notion that he can push around world leaders such as
      Vladimir Putin by treating them as though they were president of
      the Cement Workers’ Union ought to give thoughtful people the
      vapors. It doesn’t seem to occur to Trump that other countries
      could easily get pugnacious towards us. He would have us in a
      world war before the inaugural parade was over.<br>
      <br>
      The trouble is that it’s not inconceivable Trump could get
      elected. Farfetched, perhaps, but not out of the question. The USA
      is heading for a very rough patch of history — as those of you
      with your eyes on the stock indexes lately may suspect. The
      country stands an excellent chance of waking up some morning soon
      to discover it is broke and broken. When that happens, all the
      anxiety and animus will be focused on looking for scapegoats, and
      they are likely to be the wrong ones. World leaders considered
      Hitler a clown in the early going, too, you know. But the Germans
      were wild about him. He pushed a lot of the right buttons under
      the circumstances. Trump is worse than Hitler. And the American
      people, alas, are now surely a worse lot of ignorant, raging,
      tattooed slobs than the German people were in 1933. Be very
      afraid.<br>

      ...“He who seeks freedom for anything but freedom’s self is made
      to be a slave,” Alexis de Tocqueville wrote in 1856. In the
      abstract many people in this world would still agree with him:
      Freedom should be a human goal of highest order, a purpose in
      itself. Everything that makes a human truly human is lacking where
      there is no freedom.<br>
      <br>
      However, in the real world things are not that easy. The support
      of a freedom-based order is in many ways dependent on whether it
      is able to provide people with other desirable goods, such as
      prosperity, self-realization, stability, peace, moral improvement,
      and so on. It also has to compete with other types of political
      order. Socialism and other species of illiberal regimes have
      always been a temptation because they seem to promise a direct
      shortcut to achieve these goals without having to rely on a
      seemingly opaque evolutionary and spontaneous mode of development;
      it would appear that all that is necessary is a robust use of
      unrestrained power.<br>
      <br>
      Tocqueville himself had recognized this problem: “Nor do I believe
      that a true love for liberty can ever be inspired by the sight of
      the material advantages it procures, for they are not always
      clearly visible. It is very true that, in the long run, liberty
      always yields to those who know how to preserve it comfort,
      independence, and often wealth; but there are times when it
      disturbs these blessings for a while, and there are times when
      their immediate enjoyment can only be secured by a despotism.
      Those who only value liberty for their sake have never preserved
      it long.” ...<br>
      <br>
      The index published here presents a broad measure of human
      freedom, understood as the absence of coercive constraint. It uses
      76 distinct indicators of personal and economic freedom in the
      following areas:<br>
      <br>
      Rule of Law<br>
      Security and Safety<br>
      Movement<br>
      Religion<br>
