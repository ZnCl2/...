            </b><b><br>
            </b><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by Phil McKenna</b><b><br>
            </b><b><br>
            </b></div>
          It sounds like something an insane doctor might administer to
          a depressed plant. Electroshock treatment has been used on
          plants, but as a way of deriving useful biochemicals, not for
          therapy.<br>
          <br>
          The roots of garden pea plants were exposed to low-level
          electric current and subsequently produced 13 times more
          pisatin, an antifungal chemical, than plants that were not
          exposed to electricity.<br>
          <br>
          Joel Cuello, of the University of Arizona in Tucson, US, says
          the technique could be used to generate large amounts of
          chemicals that plants typically only produce in trace amounts
          as a defense against microbial attack.<br>
          <br>
          It could be adapted, he says, to make an inexpensive and
          efficient method of producing pharmaceuticals and pesticides.<br>
          <br>
          <b>'No damage'</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          Cuello came up with the idea of shocking plants after testing
          a number of other methods to mimic a biological attack in
          plants that would induce chemical production.<br>
          <br>
          "If [plant] cells are infected with fungi, they produce these
          chemicals as a response to physiological stress," says Cuello
          of the garden pea (Pisum sativum). "Anything that stresses the
          cells should result in overproduction of whatever they produce
          in response to that stress," he adds.<br>
          <br>
          Similar shock treatments applied to cell cultures of barrel
          medic (Medicago truncatula) - a plant similar to alfalfa -
          yielded a 168-fold increase in production of one chemical and
          at least a two-fold increase in 54 other compounds.<br>
          <br>
          "It's a completely novel approach to stimulate production of
          bio-chemicals in plants," says Fabricio Medina-Bolivar of
          Arkansas State University, who was not involved in the study
          but has examined other methods of eliciting chemical
          production in plants.<br>
          <br>
          "It really opens the door to producing high-value compounds
          without damaging plant tissue that could lead to significant
          reductions in cost in producing these compounds," he says.<br>
          Safe method<br>
          <br>
          To shock the plants, Cuello applied a 30 to 100 milliamp
          current to the growth-medium of plants grown hydroponically,
          or, in the case of barrel medic, to the solution surrounding
          the cell cultures.<br>
          <br>
          Other compounds that have been tested to stress plant cells
          include heavy metals, chemicals such as methyl jasmonate and
          sodium acetate, and the cell walls of microorganisms.<br>
          <br>
          But these methods have drawbacks: introduced metals and
          chemical compounds can taint desired plant chemicals and
          microbe preparation and introduction can be costly and time
          consuming.<br>
          <br>
          "I thought about electricity because you can optimise the
          magnitude and exposure time of the current," says Cuello,
          adding that the current he and colleagues used wouldn't be
          enough to electrocute a human and doesn't burn the plant's

          About 2001, some observations were made by myself and others.
          An irregularity of time flow was observed. Over several
          months, I asked questions of people located all over the
          world. Have they observed some strange time effects ? The
          answer was YES. After some deliberation, both myself and a
          fellow researcher concluded that our entire planet was
          experiencing a Planetary Time Jump, or PTJ. These jumps have
          been noticed by people in many strange ways. These include a
          change in solar position, repeated events, and even missing
          events. A physical observation observed, was related to quartz
          clocks and watch time, verses AC line powered clock time. Over
          just one month, the Quartz clock was found to be about 4 to 6
          minutes SLOWER than the time on a satellite TV or AC powered
          clock. Geographical location effect was not significant. Note
          that these three types of time keeping use totally different
          methods to keep time. Television time is derived from an
          atomic standard. This provides the precision required by the
          FCC to generate the video signals.<br>

          There exists a group of NASA satellites known as GOES. In
          orbit around the sun, these satellites have monitored the
          infrared and ultraviolet, visible light, X-ray emissions,
          magnetic field, proton and electron flux. Although highly
          chaotic, our nearest star is extremely complex and ever
          changing. This author has monitored it daily since the mid
          90's, and satellite data show that it appears to have
          generated some peculiar timed radiation patterns. These
          patterns have been seen in the past. However, they were always
          accompanied by other phenomenon. For example, solar flares or
          other elevated levels of activity. Currently our sun is
          entering a new 11 year cycle which will peak around 2012.
          (Please don't write me about 2012 - I'm already aware of that
          date's many implications.)<br>
          <br>
          Today there were five evenly spaced X-Rays pulses which were
          observed by this author:<br>
          <br>
          <div align="center"> &nbsp; <img alt="" src="81807.jpg"

          White circled area shows five perfectly timed X-Ray pulses.
          Only GOES 12 shows the source of the X-Ray emissions. All
          other satellites are quiet at these hours circled above.<br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          Yet there is no other accompanying solar activity. There are
          no solar flares, no elevated proton or electron flux levels,
          no change in the magnetic field, no change in the infrared or
          ultraviolet spectrum or any other known electromagnetic
          energy. A side note - the higher the Kp levels (green bar
          graph above) the further south one can see the Aurora.<br>
          <br>
          Here is an enlargement of the white circled area shown above:<br>
          &nbsp; <br>
          <div align="center"><img alt="" src="f002.jpg" height="514"
              width="637"><br>
          </div>
          &nbsp; <br>
          Each of the different colors shown above represents data from
          a different satellite, and each pixel (not easily discernable
          in this JPEG) represents 5 minute data. Note the evenly
          stepped drop-off in detected X-rays over three hours detected
          on August 16 which appears to be detected by only ONE
          satellite (orange line.) We also see a similar effect by the
          same satellite shortly after 0000 hours UTC on August 18. And
          there are three pulses from this satellite shown above, each
          one EXACTLY 21 hours apart. How can a random, chaotic star
          generate these patterns?<br>
          <br>
          We also see that five almost perfectly spaced X-Ray emissions
          were detected by FOUR satellites, not just one. The graph
          above shows elapsed time in 3 hour intervals. These pulses
          appear to take place every 3 hours. When I observed other
          timed X-Ray pulses like this several times in past months,
          there was increased activity with electron, proton and
          magnetic field levels making any determination of independent
          X-Ray pulse generation difficult. I remained silent until the
          big question could be answered - could this happen without an
          accompanying increase in any other Solar radiation? Now we
          know.<br>
          <br>
          One possibility I first proposed several years ago is that
          Planetary Time Jumps (PTJ) could be related to outside
          "corrections" made to prevent collision with orbiting
          near-Earth asteroids [2]. If these celestial bodies were
          emitting X-Rays as they passed by satellites, we would see a
          delay in the detection of X-Rays by each satellite. That is to
          say, the X-Ray peaks in the GOES chart would be out of phase
          with each other, or simply put, overlapping and not exactly on
          top of one another. This was not observed. Instead, we see
          four different satellites showing the same X-Ray peaks
          simultaneously. This also eliminates any possibility of
          satellite malfunction, since the odds of all four satellites
          malfunctioning simultaneously thousands of miles apart is
          beyond discussion.<br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          THINKING OUTSIDE THE KNOWN BOX<br>
          <br>
          What is not yet known is how or why these pulses were
          generated. However, it's clearly beyond all doubt these timed
          X-Ray emissions took place. My work on planetary time jumps
          three years ago appears to show an X-Ray response from the Sun
          whenever a PTJ occur.[1] If true, then at least FIVE such
          jumps have recently taken place. But how can this be?<br>
          <br>
          To perform a PTJ is not simple technology. It is clearly
          outside publicly known technology and physics. However, it
          could provide a means to prevent annihilation of the Earth if
          it were to intersect the orbit a near-Earth object. Most
          probably it would be used to avoid being exposed to an
          outburst of a massive, deadly coronal mass ejection from our
          Sun that could extinguish all life on Earth. Who could do
          this? Perhaps others "out there" want to protect the Earth for
          their own selfish reasons and not because they want to protect
          human beings and other life-forms. Massive evidence already
          exists that others visit the Earth to mine it for various
          natural resources, such as water and our DNA.<br>
          <br>
          Other planets in our solar system are effectively dead when
          compared to Earth. These would simply be left behind in the
          jump. We wouldn't even notice a time change by looking at
          other celestial bodies, since very little changes on these
          planets over long periods of time. The implications of this
          become quite interesting ­ still-functioning spacecraft around
          Mars, the rovers on Mars and the Voyager spacecraft we receive
          signals from, would be from a different time. These may
          provide the best indication of time jumps yet: The Voyager
          spacecraft have been transmitting signals more than 20 years
          BEYOND THEIR DESIGN LIFE. And the rovers on Mars ­ should have
          ceased operating about 6 months into their missions. Yet all
          continue to operate! Why?<br>
          <br>
          We know today that Mars is heating up and its polar ice is
          receding. Other planets and moons in our solar system are
          probably heating up, too. It may also be that although time
          jump technology can time jump a planet, it cannot jump
          something as massive as our Sun. If a time jump were to use
          exactly 24 hour increments, most people wouldn't notice it
          happened at all. Its human nature to only pay attention to
          things we're conditioned to see, and ignore everything else.<br>
          <br>
          On my website www.data4science.net , I've documented in the
          Time Jump section several repeated events observed by various
          people around the planet For example, passing the same car
          twice on a highway over a short period of time, or seeing the
          same person exit a building twice with only one open entrance.
          Or hearing part of a sentence rapidly repeated on a live radio
          show as this author did. These may be some of the artifacts of
          a PTJ. There probably exists tens of thousands of undocumented
          time jump observations made by countless people worldwide, who
          simply ignored it as a "figment of their imagination" or just
          a misconception. PTJs may be the biggest secret of all time,
          no pun intended.<br>
          <br>
          With regard to the recent X-Ray pulses observed on our sun,
          this may suggest that as many as FIVE such jumps have recently
          taken place. If the sun is responsible for the end of time in
          2012, it may be that a PTJ could post-pone that event. It may
          also be that these pulses were created by an outside
          intelligence, and are being used to communicate with us. Or,
          an advanced weapon has been used on Earth and we are seeing a
          response from the sun as space-time was altered. There are
          other implications too unsettling to discuss.<br>

          I've lived in this same home since 1982. This is approximately
          350 miles north-west of NYC. Whenever I've randomly checked it
          before, the north pole has always read in the same location on
          a compass. Today I checked it and It appears to have shifted
          sometime in the past year or so.<br>
          <br>
          It has moved about 5 degrees eastward. I'm located out in the
          country as shown in the attached satellite photo. There aren't
          any towers, buildings, steel or anything new in the home to
          cause this change. Although the annotated picture doesn't have
          a calibrated scale, the measured shift is 5 degrees east. This
          shift appears to be outside the normal magnetic deviation one
          might expect over a geologically short period of time, such as
          6 months.<br>
          <br>
          A friend of mine with a combination GPS and compass receiver
          did a measurement from his home near Columbia, SC today. He
          too, observed a shift of 5 degrees east. He is a former
          airforce officer and pilot, and tells me this is an unusual
          deviation over a short time period. He said his last check on
          this was about 6 months ago. Columbia is approximately 600
          miles almost exactly due south of here.<br>
          <br>
          Rense.com readers can participate and help confirm
          observations with their own compass. It doesn't matter where
          they live. In fact, the more spread out the better. There are
          existing annotated aviation maps showing that magnetic
          deviation is not consistent around the US. And its probably
          not consistent anywhere else in the world, too.<br>
          <br>
          If a polar shift is indeed underway, then the clock is running
          for a massive, possibly permanent weather shift... the same
          one discussed in the Pentagon doom and gloom weather report
          posted on Rense.com.<br>
          <br>
          Even a partial pole shift could have serious weather
          implications. Radiation levels are actually higher at the
          poles. Pole rotation will almost certainly cause changes in
          the ozone layer and weather patterns around the earth. And
          also the length of winter which this year in NY state, doesn't
          seem to want to end.<br>
          <br>
          Since the northern lights are mostly in the north polar
          regions because of the location of the magnetic pole which
          serves as a high energy particle trap, we will begin to see
          the northern lights more visible father south as well. When
          the pole rotates 90 degrees, people could be seeing the
          "northern lights" down in Cuba. That is...if the weather
          hasn't become so hostile there that people are not all-
          consumed trying to survive, and have no time to look into the
          heavens...<br>
          <br>
          Another interesting implication is that of planetary time
          jumps. )This is covered on my website at
          http://www.quantum.myblackvault.com ) We know that in earth's
          history, the poles have reversed a number of times. What isn't
          precisely known is the impact on earth's weather when this
          happens. If the time jumps are happening, then a sudden shift
          in pole position could also be an indicator of it.<br>
          <br>
          Let's set up a volunteer, completely non-profit group around
          the country to take readings to monitor these changes. It
          would be foolish to count on the science community or "Uncle
          Sam" to give us the truth. If we begin ASAP we can start a
          baseline reference to track this. We can establish that it is
          either continuing eastward, or that it will return west-ward
          again. Or, it moves in a progressive-remissive fashion with
          more movement in one direction than the other. If enough data
          is gathered we can establish what is happening and perhaps
          produce a timeline.<br>
          <br>
          I'll also provide periodic reports to you for posting on this
          phenomena. If someone is interested in participating, please

          <br>
          About 2001, some observations were made by myself and others.
          An irregularity of time flow was observed. Over several
          months, I asked questions of people located all over the
          world. Have they observed some strange time effects ? The
          answer was YES. After some deliberation, both myself and a
          fellow researcher concluded that our entire planet was
          experiencing a Planetary Time Jump, or PTJ. These jumps have
          been noticed by people in many strange ways. These include a
          change in solar position, repeated events, and even missing
          events. A physical observation observed, was related to quartz
          clocks and watch time, verses AC line powered clock time. Over
          just one month, the Quartz clock was found to be about 4 to 6
          minutes SLOWER than the time on a satellite TV or AC powered
          clock. Geographical location effect was not significant. Note
          that these three types of time keeping use totally different
          methods to keep time. Television time is derived from an
          atomic standard. This provides the precision required by the
          FCC to generate the video signals.<br>
          <br>
          One must remember that the human mind functions outside of
          spacetime. Therefore, you can see the effect since you are not
          actually tightly coupled to local time. However, remember that
          you were born into a specific time flow as everyone is.
          Therefore, PTJ effects will cause you to feel light headed,
          unable to concentrate, and in general, not feeling yourself.
          Like jet lag, you will adjust to the effects. If you have not
          already done so, I strongly recommend you read the Quantum
          Gravity document shown above.<br>
          <br>
          Here at the Quantum Hyperspace Group, we are working on
          completing a theory of the cause of these PTJs.<br>
          <br>
          At this point, there are just a few reasons we can see that
          these are happening:<br>
          <br>
          1. If it is a naturally occurring event, then randomness would
          insure that when they occur, we frequently would be suddenly
          thrust from daytime from night, or the reverse. This is not
          the case. If anything, these are taking place at 24 hour
          increments, or 1 year increments. Such increments would be
          almost invisible except to those looking for them.<br>
          <br>
          2. If these jumps are intentionally created, then there are
          only a few reasons for it. The reasons would have been decided
          from the use of Remote Viewing technology, or from classified
          time travel.<br>
          <br>
          These are the reasons:<br>
          <br>
          a. A large impactor (asteroid) will strike the earth, causing
          a mass extinction event.<br>
          <br>
          b. A very large CME (Coronal Mass Ejection) will be released
          from the sun, causing a serious threat to all life on earth.<br>
          <br>
          c. There is an anticipated invasion from an alien race.<br>
          <br>
          In any event, we KNOW that these PTJs are taking place. It is
          difficult to conceive of how certain governments on earth
          would respond, IF these are being generated without their
          knowledge or consent.<br>
          <br>
          If you are still asking yourself How can a PTJ avoid these
          things then consider the following- that all “accidents”
          require precision timing. For example, you get into a car
          accident on the way to work with someone else. If you had not
          left your home at PRECISELY the right time, it would not have
          happened. We know that we cannot deflect asteroids. Even
          though they do not have weight in space, they still have mass.
          It still requires an enormous amount of force to cause any
          change in a massive, multi-million metric ton asteroid’s
          trajectory. That technology officially doesn’t exist.<br>
          <br>
          However, if we could move the earth in time, then when the
          asteroid gets here, then the Earth wouldn’t be here. Problem
          solved. The same is true for a CME from the sun, or even an
          invasion from an outside force. It is almost a god-like power
          when one thinks about it … And it may be the greatest story of
          the century.<br>
          <br>
          Technology, which you would think of as science fiction,
          exists. It is kept for use by the military to help the insure
          global dominance. “The average person cannot handle the idea
          we are not alone.” Such was the conclusion reached by a
          government sponsored think tank report. The fifty year old
          Brookings Report, a product of the Brookings Institution, made
          this conclusion. It was believed at that time it would cause
          many of our world’s religions to crumble almost overnight.<br>
          <br>
          A complex, carefully orchestrated plan of information
          disemination was started several decades ago. The purpose was
          to slowly and carefully bring “people up to speed” about UFOs,
          aliens, etc. And it appears to be working- In a poll twenty
          years ago, less than 50% of people believed in alien life. A
          recent poll showed this is now almost 70%. Are you one of the
          30% that still don’t believe….? <br>

          WARNING:<br>
          <br>
          If you are timid and do not wish to know of Life terminating
          events, proceed no further.<br>
          <br>
          I will be discussing evidence that has been in existence for a
          long, long time concerning the termination of this Planet<br>
          <br>
          Even though I gave you proof in the past of Terminating
          Mechanisms and Timing from many of these sources I list below,
          no longer will anyone who is interested in this topic have to
          rely on these:<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prophecy whatever the source,<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The forged or genuine Scriptures of Old,<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Revelations of St. John the Divine,<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rants by Tele-evangelistic Morons,<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Predictions by Mayans, Aztecs, Sumerians,
          Annunaki, etc.,<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Calenders of the Jewish Religious Holidays,<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Books written about the prognostications of
          Nostradamus, St Malachi, Mother Shipton, Edgar Cayce, and so
          on.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They will NOT have to rely on information
          given by metaphysical scholars like myself.<br>
          <br>
          I have covered many of these points in previous articles, and
          they may be of interest to you.<br>
          <br>
          However, now all of us are able to examine Physical Evidence
          for ourselves.<br>
          <br>
          There is no need to have Faith in Superior Forces for the
          moment, just to understand what is going on in our immediate
          physical lives.<br>
          <br>
          There is no need to have had contact with Superior, or more
          advanced, Aliens who prognosticated about our future, the
          demise of Earth, the spiritual separation of Viables from
          non-Viables, and so on.<br>
          <br>
          There is no need to rely on Angelic Visitations or
          Instructions given in a Near-Death Experience, or an
          Out-of-Body Experiences.<br>
          <br>
          We can forget Meditational Communications, intuitive dreams
          and implanted prophetic thoughts for the moment.<br>
          <br>
          We can forget the Tea leaves, the Ouija Boards, the Tarot
          Cards, the Psychics and the pseudo-psychic con-artists that
          abound in this evil, nauseating world.<br>
          <br>
          Astrology no longer counts. To my mind it almost never did.<br>
          <br>
          The only Numerology you need now is the ability to calculate
          the speed, direction of travel, and distance of certain
          Celestial Objects from Earth, and to calculate the timing of
          impact, and the number of people that may be affected by the
          Objects’ impacts with Earth.<br>
          <br>
          The videos I give below make it easy.<br>
          <br>
          People whose profession is in Astrophysics, Astrology and
          Meteor-tracking do all the work for us.<br>
          <br>
          You do not have to recall that I was INVITED to visit a
          Spacecraft, in April 1985, on which the End of the World was
          discussed by Superior Beings from another Dimension with me.<br>
          <br>
          Do you recall my message that I gave 30 years ago stating that
          the Earth was going to be cleared of all living things in
          preparation for its total destruction?<br>
          <br>
          Well, now you don’t have to know any of that detail because
          what is presented as solid, prosaic proof by experts in
          Physical Sciences, not by Metaphysicians or Aliens, is all you
          need to know.<br>
          <br>
          You don’t even have to know that I travelled to far away and
          exotic places on Earth for over 20 years, seeking UFO
          contactees who were given the same message I had.<br>
          <br>
          This is what each said:<br>
          <br>
          “The World is to end according to Aliens that recently visited
          us.<br>
          <br>
          The ‘bad’ (meaning evil) people are finished.<br>
          <br>
          The Good people are to be taken elsewhere to continue their
          existence.”<br>
          <br>
          On one of my trips to Mexico, the late Joyce Murphy of Beyond
          Boundaries was astounded when I repeatedly elicited these
          remarks from contactees she had previously known but who had
          never divulged this knowledge.<br>
          <br>
          You don’t need to know any of these things.<br>
          <br>
          Boy, aren’t you lucky to be spared all that study of How,
          When, Why, by Whom the destruction is being executed, etc.,
          regarding the Endtime, now that the information of Earth’s end
          is handed to us on a platter by SCIENTISTS!!<br>
          <br>
          These same scientists probably have never heard of
          Gnosticisms, or the Ancient Wisdom or the Eschatological
          Doctrine that discusses the Spiritual Consequences of
          existence in this Physical Dimension.<br>
          <br>
          Most people, for any number of reasons, probably never gave
          much thought to a Battle between Good and Evil or about the
          Existence of a Superior Being who is surely slightly less or ,
          we hope, a lot less, insane than the Lunatic who built this
          outrageously evil and exploitative Asylum we call the
          ever-suffering Earth.<br>
          <br>
          Aren’t we lucky?<br>
          <br>
          Simply by waiting, all the information we need to know about
          ‘What is Going On’ has simply fallen into our laps.<br>
          <br>
          No need to read boring Religious Texts, Hypocritical Ones or
          Apocryphal ones, the Nag Hammadi Library, Dead Sea Scrolls,
          books about other books, or go to long, perhaps at times
          boring, lectures given by Metaphysicians, like myself, who
          insist on talking about Good and Bad people and the separation
          thereof.<br>
          <br>
          Finally, anyone that can read and watch a video or listen to a
          discussion on TV will be able to examine the evidence of what
          is to happen.<br>
          <br>
          You won’t need University Degrees to understand the evidence.<br>
          <br>
          You don’t need a telescope.<br>
          <br>
          All you need to do is watch what is presented and then ask
          yourself these questions:<br>
          <br>
          “Is this possible?”<br>
          <br>
          Is this probable?<br>
          <br>
          Is it a certainty?<br>
          <br>
          Where do I stand in the face of this news?<br>
          <br>
          If we all die physically, what next?<br>
          <br>
          Can I find answers?”<br>
          <br>
          The answer to the last question is “YES”!<br>

          The Spiritual Reality, which has been shamefully neglected by
          Science, will now be seen to be the only Reality that was ever
          worth considering.<br>
          <br>
          Physicality has been a deadly mistake, a spiritual CANCER to
          be eradicated at all costs.<br>
          <br>
          Of course, what is to happen does not rely at all upon what
          people believe or don’t believe.<br>
          <br>
          What is to be, will be!<br>
          <br>
          PROPOSED TERMINATION SCHEDULE<br>
          <br>
          Here is the general schedule for the END. It may vary a
          little.<br>
          <br>
          Sept 2015:&nbsp; Meteor hits Earth just N-E of the Bermuda
          triangle.<br>
          <br>
          1/3-1/2 of world’s population perishes within days.<br>
          <br>
          From then on ­ Massive volcanoes, earthquakes, hurricanes,
          etc.; many more killed.<br>
          <br>
          Early 2016 --&nbsp; Dust from Planet X starts suffocating
          aerobes on the planet.<br>
          <br>
          August 2016 --Around this date due to gravitational effects as
          explained on the video below, Pole Shift occurs with drowning
          of remainder on Earth within hours .<br>
          <br>
          Late October 2016 ­--A more massive meteor hits the near
          sterile Earth and breaks it into smithereens ­ this shall be
          witnessed by survivors on the Rescue crafts. The elite in
          their underground bases are physically no more<br>
          <br>
          The occurrence or otherwise of Nuclear War is no longer
          important;<br>
          <br>
          Fukushima radioactivity, although a disaster that in tself
          would in due course wipe out all life on the planet is no
          longer relevant;<br>
          <br>
          Deadly GMO foodstuffs, land and lives destroying HAARP
          technology, dementing Vaccines, Ubiquitous Chemtrails, and so
          on, are all of no importance any more. Time has finished.<br>
          <br>
          Of the (Evil) Alien - Humanity Relationship<br>
          <br>
          Some of you may know that preparations are afoot to formally
          and openly introduce Evil Aliens to Humanity most probably via
          the Vatican and its Papacy and organizations such as NASA
          which are all evil instruments of this Evil Empire. It has
          been NASA which has done the most to obfuscate the picture of
          planetary termination by any means at its disposal including,
          some have said, murder of its employees and those who would
          thwart their nefarious plans.<br>
          <br>
          These plans of Disclosure will come to naught as will the
          plans of the Evil Aliens to introduce a hybrid species,
          implement Agenda 21 and reduce the population of Earth to
          perhaps less than 500 million serfs, and to take total, and
          open, control of the planet and enslave us all.<br>
          <br>
          All short and long-term plans that Evil Aliens have for Earth
          and Humanity will come to zero as they themselves will be
          captured and liquidated.<br>
          <br>
          Some of you may know that Evil Aliens have not only
          experimented with the physical aspects of Humanity and the
          physical manifestations of “Life” on this Planet but also run
          the planet to suit themselves. However, there has always been
          a number of groups of these Evil Aliens vying for control, and
          this partly accounts for the massive friction between sectors
          of Humanity and the inter-alien and inter-dimensional wars
          that have been discussed in various aspects of the (mainly
          alternate) Media.<br>
          <br>
          It is a fact that the War between Good and Evil extends to
          battles between Good and Evil Aliens and the result is a
          foregone conclusion. The Good Ones (our spiritual rescuers)
          win, of course. Otherwise the Viables would not be going
          anywhere.<br>
          <br>
          There is much more to discuss and reveal about this topic and
          I may do so in the near future.<br>
          <br>
          If these details of Aliens and their Plans, and their Wars,
          are beyond your comprehension, it matters not. Simply meditate
          on the Message of Physical Finality for now.<br>
          <br>
          With the information I am revealing now, the brain-dead and
          very EVIL morons, who dared call me an Insane Lunatic (and
          worse) from the very first moment I delivered my Message of
          Finality to the World in 1985, now have a clear view of their
          Path to their Hell and their waiting Transmutation Chambers.<br>
          <br>
          This group includes all the doctors, psychiatrists, lawyers,
          Members of Medical Boards, the Media, Governments,
          Religionists, New Agers, etc., etc., who made it their
          personal role to not only defame me, but also to go out of
          their way in an attempt to destroy me, and any who supported
          me, and to disadvantage me financially, socially, mentally,
          emotionally and intellectually. They have done all they could
          to block free circulation of my Message and Knowledge. They
          have most assuredly FAILED! They, of course, have done much
          worse to me in my previous incarnations on this local level.<br>
          <br>
          But, they have failed and I have won.<br>
          <br>
          The Plan to eradicate them in this Galaxy, as in all other
          Galaxies, and all the Physical Manifestation, has been all but
          fought and won.<br>
          <br>
          They are just simply Cannon Fodder now.<br>
          <br>
          They are the dust on Hell’s floor.<br>
          <br>

          12 Planet X and the Pole shift:<br>
          <br>
          This is the most detailed and important video. Listen
          carefully. Many astronomers were assassinated to keep these
          revelations away from the general public. But now, the Truth
          is out.<br>
          <br>
          Please note that while the commentator in this next video ends
          on a positive note, saying he will ‘see you on the backside”,
          I say emphatically that there will be no chance of a physical
          reprieve for anyone.<br>
          <br>
          We will be all gone, gone, gone.<br>
          <br>
          Depending on which group he belongs to, he may see you in the
          Viable or non-Viable camp.<br>
          <br>
          https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JUHjf7ivmIM&amp;app=desktop<br>
          <br>
          These videos are just a small sample.<br>
          <br>
          There are many more videos on YouTube.<br>
          <br>
          As time goes by, more specific ones will be added, I am sure,
          which will contain more up-to-the-minute information.<br>
          <br>
          I had mentioned the arrival of destructive meteors in my book
          “My experiences of aliens and other Realities”. So to those
          who read that book these events will be no surprise.<br>
          <br>
          The Earth has been struck many, many times by meteors that
          have caused great damage.<br>
          <br>
          But I assure you, there will be no more such events for, in
          all likelihood, if the above data is accurate, there will be
          no more Earth after 2016.<br>
          <br>
          Let’s make an assumption at this point.<br>
          <br>
          Assuming someone believed what was revealed in the videos,
          except number 8, apart from perhaps suffering a Panic Attack,
          what else is on the menu to ask about, if that someone had
          never thought of the Endtime?<br>
          <br>
          Well, I think the first thought that will spring into one’s
          head will be more of an exclamatory questioning of the fate of
          him/herself and his/her loved ones.<br>
          <br>
          And it is here that a massive headache may begin.<br>
          <br>
          Is this Termination of Humanity merely another phase of a
          senseless existence?<br>
          <br>
          We know that there have been many near extinction events of
          Life on Earth in the past.<br>
          <br>
          There is proof of them. But the Earth continued on and Life,
          in a myriad of forms, returned.<br>
          <br>
          Whether Superior Aliens re-seeded the ‘Colony’, as they would
          see it, is really irrelevant to our discussion.<br>
          <br>
          If this Planet is to be destroyed, will we be elsewhere
          thereafter or do we totally perish?<br>
          <br>
          We know from the astrophysicists that many Planets, Suns,
          Solar Systems and whole Galaxies are routinely destroyed. We
          have evidence via the powerful telescopes above Earth’s
          atmosphere.<br>
          <br>
          Perhaps it is simply our turn to be eradicated.<br>
          <br>
          But, is that the end of us all, of our loved ones?<br>
          <br>
          What more do I need to know to answer these questions?<br>
          <br>
          Again one needs to ask: “Is there survival after physical
          death?”<br>
          <br>
          Is Reincarnation real?<br>
          <br>
          Do we Reincarnate elsewhere?<br>
          <br>
          Is there a Supreme Consciousness that judges who will continue
          and who will not?<br>
          <br>
          Is there really an incorruptible Divine Justice that exists
          somewhere after this Termination event, a Justice System
          unlike the one on this Earth, on which Justice, so-called, is
          the jaundiced prerogative of the rich, the bellicose, the
          psychopathically powerful and the profane?<br>
          <br>
          Could there be Evil after all?<br>
          <br>
          And could this extermination really be, as Gnostics contend, a
          definitive Solution to the Problem of Evil?<br>
          <br>
          Looking around the planet, with so much brutality, animosity
          and Madness to be seen and recorded throughout the known Eons
          of Time, who but a fool would not admit that Evil exists?<br>
          <br>
          The most self-righteous Nations have done the most horribly
          evil things as is now being revealed for all of us to see.<br>
          <br>
          Yes, Evil definitely exists.<br>
          <br>
          So this physical termination of which there can be no doubt,
          if the data of SCIENTISTS is to be believed, may very well be,
          not an accident, but the purposeful Ending of an Evil Essence
          in this Planet.<br>
          <br>
          And what if the Gnostics are correct, saying that all
          Physicality is the creation of Evil?<br>
          <br>
          If that is so, then it all must go.<br>
          <br>
          It must all be destroyed like a life-threatening cancer would
          have to be.<br>
          <br>
          Yes, there is data for the destruction of our Sun and the
          sister planets of this Solar System.<br>
          <br>
          There is, as I said, evidence of destruction of Galaxies.<br>
          <br>
          Empirically then, after examining these episodes of
          destructiveness, we may well say that this Galaxy could quite
          well be on the list for extermination.<br>
          <br>
          I have written that approximately 94% of the Physical Universe
          has been eradicated.<br>
          <br>
          Recently, scientists claimed they cannot find about 95% of the
          Universe. It seems to have just disappeared.<br>
          <br>
          Can we put these two statements together and say that I am
          indeed correct in my assessment?<br>
          <br>
          I stated what I stated before the scientists admitted that
          they can’t find 95% of the Universe.<br>
          <br>
          How did I know?<br>
          <br>
          Is there a Source of Knowledge feeding beings like myself down
          here?<br>
          <br>
          If there is not, how could I have possibly known the things I
          wrote about?<br>
          <br>
          If there is, what else is there to know, now that belief in
          Termination of the Planet has been facilitated by tangible,
          plausible, matter-of-fact, scientific evidence?<br>
          <br>
          Some of us, depending on our physical location on this orb may
          have less than 8 months to find out the answers to the
          Mysteries of Life.<br>
          <br>
          From where, and when, do we begin the journey to valid
          answers?<br>
          <br>
          Will any of us continue after this termination event?<br>
          <br>
          Who will continue?<br>
          <br>
          What makes some able to continue?<br>
          <br>
          Why do others not continue?<br>
          <br>
          Where will we continue?<br>
          <br>
          Who will say who is Viable and who is not?<br>
          <br>
          Some of us have dismissed such thoughts throughout our lives,
          in the mistaken belief we would never need answers to them.<br>
          <br>
          But, here we are, facing physical extermination.<br>
          <br>
          We now need answers.<br>
          <br>
          The Anxiety and Fear will not be enough.<br>
          <br>
          To escape the conundrum, what could be the point of
          self-emulation?<br>
          <br>
          That is not going to solve any problems.<br>
          <br>
          That will not give any answers.<br>
          <br>
          All it may do is shift the Reality from this physical level to
          some other level we may not fully know about or understand at
          present.<br>
          <br>
          There must be some other levels.<br>
          <br>
          Even the smart Quantum Physicists talk about multiple
          dimensions and existences beyond this Physical level.<br>
          <br>
          So I guess on some paradigm other levels exist.<br>
          <br>
          Finally, what are we to make of talk from the so-called
          captured robotic alien entities (reportedly from the future)
          and from Sirius B, the Galactic Federation and Pleiadian
          transmissions telling us some humans and humanoids will
          elevate in vibration while others will live underground,
          meaning the Earth will live on? I’ll answer with a question.
          How often have these supposed ‘alien’ morons been correct?
          Zero times is the answer. They are not privy to my
          information, and obviously they can’t play human videos to
          learn the bleeding obvious truth of our status quo!<br>
          <br>
          So, as I see it, 2 groups of humans will emerge:<br>
          <br>
          The Viable and the Non-Viable.<br>
          <br>
          Viables will be rescued by “Plasma Crafts”, either before or
          after their physical death.<br>
          <br>
          Non-Viables will all die physically and proceed to
          Transmutation vats.<br>
          <br>
          IN WHICH GROUP WILL YOU BELONG?<br>

          Quote from Alexandra of Forbidden Knowledge: “This lecture is
          too true for me to broadcast. It's a doggone shame. If ever
          there was a truth that most people couldn't handle. This would
          be it. With so much mystification and BS blinding us at all
          times, it's a miracle that an incarnate human was able to
          articulate this message.”<br>

          <br>
          London mayor Boris Johnson made his comments in reference to
          an MI5 report on the profile of jihadis<br>
          <br>
          Boris Johnson has described men who go to fight with Islamic
          State as “literally wankers” who watch porn because they can’t
          meet women.<br>
          <br>
          Citing a report from MI5 on the profile of jihadis, the mayor
          of London said: “If you look at all the psychological
          profiling about bombers, they typically will look at porn.
          They are literally wankers. Severe onanists.”<br>
          <br>
          Seriously Boris, calling terrorists ‘wankers’ is really not
          helpful<br>
          <br>
          Johnson described British jihadis as “tortured” and “very
          badly adjusted in their relations with women”, something he
          said was a symptom of “their feeling of being a failure and
          that the world is against them”.<br>
          <br>
          “They are not making it with girls and so they turn to other
          forms of spiritual comfort – which of course is no comfort.”<br>
          <br>
          He continued: “They are just young men in desperate need of
          self-esteem who do not have a particular mission in life, who
          feel that they are losers and this thing makes them feel
          strong – like winners.”<br>
          <br>
          Johnson, who is one of the leading candidates to be the next
          Tory leader, made the comments in an interview with the Sun
          newspaper a week after he visited the Kurdish regional capital
          of Irbil to see the Peshmerga fighters who are pushing back
          against the Isis insurgency in Iraq. The visit, during which
          he posed for pictures with an AK47, was interpreted as an
          attempt to demonstrate his credentials as an international
          statesman.<br>
          <br>
          Speaking on Sky News later on Friday, Johnson defended his
          comments, saying they weren’t “remotely controversial”.<br>
          <br>
          He argued that there was plenty of evidence to support his
          point: “The crucial thing is that these are young men,
          principally young men who are growing up without much sense of
          success in their lives, without a feeling that the world holds
          much for them and … their problems need addressing in all
          sorts of ways.”<br>
          <br>
          Johnson, who is likely to return to the Commons in May as MP
          for the safe Tory seat of Uxbridge and South Ruislip, said the
          best solution to the problem of young men becoming radicalised
          was to provide them with jobs. London had much lower youth
          unemployment than Paris, where 12 were killed in an attack by
          Islamic fundamentalists at the beginning of January, he added.<br>
          <br>
          “The whole thing is ludicrous,” said Charlie Winter from the
          Quilliam Foundation, an organisation set up by ex-Islamists to
          challenge and counter extremism.<br>
          <br>
          He said it was “completely unquantifiable” to try to second
          guess whether a jihadist was suffering from isolation and
          loneliness.<br>
          <br>
          “To imply that they don’t have social skills is again a
          generalisation … that has no evidence behind it. They are
          integrated, many of them are very well educated.”<br>
          <br>
          Mohammed Khaliel, director of the community cohesion
          organisation Islamix, said: “These are the type of comments
          you’d expect from the EDL, the BNP and possibly Ukip.<br>
          <br>
          “Somebody in a position of responsibility should be making
          responsible comments,” he said. “For somebody allegedly
          aspiring to be prime minister of the country, is this really
          the style and level of comments that he should be making?<br>
          <br>
          “He’s trying for election in Uxbridge and he thinks any
          publicity is good publicity, but he doesn’t care about the
          discord that it causes in the community.”<br>
          <br>
          A spokesman for David Cameron said Johnson had an “ever lovely
          turn of phrase”, but declined to say whether the prime
          minister endorsed the comments. “You’ve heard the prime
          minister talk a great deal around the terror threat,” he said.<br>
          <br>
          The chancellor, George Osborne, said during a visit to
          Portsmouth on Friday that while Johnson’s remarks were
          colourful he was “right not to be nice about these people”.<br>
          <br>
          Johnson has provoked controversy in the past with comments on
          Islamic extremism. Writing in his column in the Daily
          Telegraph last August, the mayor said that jihadist men, such
          as the member of Isis dubbed Jihadi John who killed the
          American journalist James Foley, are told that they will be
          welcomed in heaven by 72 virgins if they die in battle.<br>
          <br>
          Johnson wrote: “I suspect most of us don’t give a monkey’s
          what happens to this prat in heaven, whether he meets virgins
          or raisins – we just want someone to come along with a bunker
          buster and effect an introduction as fast as possible.”<br>
          <br>
          Referring to Johnson’s interview in the Sun, the Conservative
          party chairman, Grant Shapps, said he could use all sorts of
          words to describe “any Brit who leaves and fights against this
          country’s interests like that”.<br>
          <br>
          “I think the mood has decisively shifted in favour of people
          saying: ‘This country will give all of us our education for
          free, it will give all of us our health for free, but don’t
          expect to go off and fight against this country’s interests
          and expect to swan back in’. I think Boris’s comments will
          have been driven by that.”<br>
          <br>
          The government’s counter-terror and security bill, which is
          currently passing through parliament, would create extra
          powers to block some terrorist suspects from returning to
          Britain from Syria and Iraq. The bill’s terms allow a person’s
          passport to be invalidated for up to two years, preventing
          them from returning to the UK during that time.<br>
          <br>
          In the Sun interview, Johnson agreed with comments made by the
          culture secretary, Sajid Javid, that Muslim communities face a
          special burden to help to track down Islamist extremists.
          Johnson said clerics had not been “persuasive in the right way
          with these people”.<br>
          <br>
          He said he wanted to hear a “proper angry Islamic theological
          denunciation of what is going wrong”.<br>
          <br>
          “We won’t succeed if western politicians just go around
          bashing and blaming Islam; that is hopeless … This problem can
          only be addressed if Muslim authorities and clerics find a
          powerful and compelling way of setting up an alternative
          narrative for young people that makes this seem irrelevant.”<br>
