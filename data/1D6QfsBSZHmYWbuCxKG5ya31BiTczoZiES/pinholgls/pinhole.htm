      <br>
      Pinhole glasses, also known as stenopeic glasses, are eyeglasses
      with a series of pinhole-sized perforations filling an opaque
      sheet of plastic in place of each lens. Similar to the workings of
      a pinhole camera, each perforation allows only a very narrow beam
      of light to enter the eye which reduces the size of the circle of
      confusion on the retina and increases depth of field. In eyes with
      refractive error, the result is claimed to be a clearer image.
      However, a second effect may appear at the common bridge between
      each two adjacent holes, whereby two different rays of light
      coming from the same object (but each passing through a different
      hole) are diffracted back toward the eye and onto different places
      on the retina. This leads to double vision (objects having doubled
      edges) around the rim of each hole the eye is not focussing on,
      which can make the overall image disturbing and tiring to look at
      for prolonged periods of time.<br>
      <br>
      Unlike conventional prescription glasses, pinhole glasses produce
      an image without the pincushion effect around the edges (which
      makes straight lines appear curved). While pinhole glasses are
      claimed to be useful for people who are both near- and
      far-sighted, they are not recommended for people with over 6
      diopters of myopia. Additionally, pinhole glasses reduce
      brightness and peripheral vision,[1][2] and thus should not be
      used for driving or when operating machinery.[3]<br>
      <br>
      Merchants state that after prolonged use, the plastic grating
      should become easy to ignore. However, each time the user blinks,
      the horizontal lines of the grating will briefly appear to be
      thicker. This is because the eyelid moving over the pupil will
      reduce the amount of light falling onto the retina and thus will
      briefly remove the lateral inhibition effect which normally makes
      all the holes appear bigger (and the grating appear thinner). So,
      as long as the user keeps blinking, they will be constantly
      reminded of the dark grating covering their eyes.<br>
      <br>
      Pinhole glasses have been marketed by various companies on the
      claim that—combined with certain eye exercises—they could
      permanently improve eyesight. Skeptics argue that no scientific
      evidence has been found to support them. Due to a lack of formal
      clinical studies to substantiate this type of claim by companies
      selling pinhole glasses, this type of claim is no longer allowed
      to be made in the United States under the terms of a legal
      settlement with the Federal Trade Commission.[4]<br>
      <br>
      The pinhole occluder, a device used by ophthalmologists and
      optometrists for diagnosis of refractive errors, works on the same
      principles, but is not intended for use outside of diagnosis.<br>
      <br>
      As viewing through a pinhole can much improve clarity of vision of
      people with refractive error, in an emergency a clear view can
      sometimes be obtained by looking through a single improvised
      pinhole.<br>

      Tuesday 29 July 1997<br>
      <br>
      A pair of glasses which can permanently improve eyesight rather
      than just correct it may sound like the stuff of dreams. But this
      is the promise being made for "pinhole" glasses - they look like
      sunglasses covered with a grid of tiny holes - by their
      manufacturer, a company in Somerset. Wearing the glasses for 15-20
      minutes a day, it claims, can lead to noticeable improvements in
      vision.<br>
      <br>
      The glasses can apparently also help relieve VDU eye strain,
      fatigue and headaches - and all for the price of pounds 25 a pair.<br>
      <br>
      These claims were recently given a splash in one particular
      tabloid, with the result that the company's lines are constantly
      engaged by eager potential purchasers. They are, however, strongly
      disputed by the College of Optometrists which says they are
      unsubstantiated and should be viewed "with a great deal of
      caution".<br>
      <br>
      So who is right? There's no doubt that while they are being worn,
      pinhole glasses make for a clearer image for those with vision
      defects, similar to the effect of screwing up the eyes. They do
      this by artificially making the pupils smaller and reducing the
      amount of light getting through.<br>
      <br>
      The "pinhole effect" has been known about for centuries and
      pinhole glasses are used by optometrists (who are qualified to
      examine vision) as a sight aid where conventional glasses cannot
      help - in the case of a scarred cornea, for example. But they are
      not normally used where prescription glasses can be used, because
      they cut down on light, and cannot give as clear an image.<br>
      <br>
      The manufacturer, Trayner Pinhole Glasses, argues that its product
      has a more permanent effect than this. It says that while normal
      glasses encourage the eye to become lazy, the pinhole type
      encourage the ciliary muscles to become stronger, pulling the lens
      into the correct shape. This is based on the view that the eye can
      be made to adapt to its environment and can be encouraged to
      change shape towards normal. Improvements can be made, it is
      claimed, within a few weeks in the case of those who use reading
      glasses (where the lens is too stiff rather than the wrong shape),
      and within a few months in the case of those with distance lenses.<br>
      <br>
      The traditional view, however, is that poor sight is for the most
      part genetic, and is caused by the eye being too short (in the
      case of long- sightedness) or too long (in short-sightedness), so
      that the image is focused either behind or in front of the retina.
      Optometrists say there is little evidence that muscle exercises of
      any kind will help poor sight, which can only be put right by
      prescription glasses.<br>
      <br>
      What is certain is that so far, there have been no published
      clinical trials of the effect of pinhole glasses on permanent
      vision. The College of Optometrists points out that the company
      has been "pressed for scientific validation of its claims" but
      that clinical trials which were arranged "were not pursued to
      their conclusion". The company's director, Peter Duthie (whose own
      background is electronic engineering), admits that all his
      evidence is so far anecdotal but retorts that optometrists have
      been reluctant to carry out the trials which under current
      legislation he cannot conduct himself.<br>
      <br>
      This is not the first time that pinhole glasses have been marketed
      in Britain. In 1992, Birmingham City Council won a case under the
      Trade Descriptions Act (1968) against a manufacturer making claims
      about the health benefits of pinhole glasses. In 1993 the
      Advertising Standards Authority upheld a complaint about claims
      that by wearing pinhole glasses, people could give up wearing
      conventional glasses.<br>
      <br>
      Certainly there is no substitute for having the eye examined to
      detect problems in eyesight and eye disease; self-diagnosis is
      inadvisable. The College of Optometrists also says that walking
      round while wearing pinhole glasses in normal lighting conditions
      could be dangerous and wearing them while driving even more so.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">1. Field of the Invention</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      The present invention relates to eyewear, and more particularly,
      to corrective eyewear that provides the option of using a lens or
      a pinhole aperture disposed adjacent to the lens.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">2. Description of Related Art</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      There are a number of conditions of the eye that affect one's
      visual acuity over a range of distances. Myopia
      ("near-sightedness") refers generally to a condition in which
      distant objects appear blurred. It is often caused by an elongated
      eyeball which causes light to focus in front of the retina instead
      of directly on it. On the other hand, hyperopia
      ("far-sightedness") refers to the opposite condition, in which
      nearby objects appear blurred. As one might guess, hyperopia is
      caused by a shortened eyeball which causes light to focus behind
      the retina instead of directly on it.<br>
      <br>
      Those who are fortunate enough to have avoided developing myopia
      or hyperopia, however, will inevitably develop presbyopia.
      Presbyopia is a vision condition in which the crystalline lens of
      the eye loses its flexibility, making it difficult to focus on
      close objects. Presbyopia usually becomes noticeable in the early
      to mid-40s and is a natural part of the aging process of the eye.
      It is not a disease, and it cannot be prevented. Thus, the need
      for corrective eyewear will be inevitable for most people.<br>
      <br>
      The most common types of corrective eyewear are corrective lenses,
      such as glasses or contact lenses. Corrective lenses may be worn
      to correct most refraction errors of the eyes. Single vision
      lenses have the same optical correction over the entire area of
      the lens and are therefore suitable for those who suffer from a
      single refractive error. Many people, however, may suffer from
      more than one refractive error. For example, a person may have
      various combinations of myopia, hyperopia, presbyopia, or
      astigmatism. In such cases, bifocals, trifocals, or progressive
      lenses may be necessary.<br>
      <br>
      Bifocals and trifocals are eyeglasses in which the lenses have two
      and three distinct regions of different optical powers,
      respectively. Bifocals are most commonly prescribed to people with
      presbyopia who also require correction for myopia, hyperopia,
      and/or astigmatism. Trifocals similar to bifocals, with the
      exception that trifocals have an additional segment for
      intermediate vision above the reading section and below the
      distance section. Trifocals are becoming rarer as more and more
      people are choosing to wear progressive lenses. Progressive lenses
      provide a gradient of increasing lens power, from minimal or no
      magnification at the top of the lens to maximum magnification at
      the bottom of the lens. A wearer can view objects at different
      viewing distances by directing his line of sight through
      appropriate parts of the lens.<br>
      <br>
      Although corrective lenses have been developed to correct a
      variety of refractive errors, they are still limited to correcting
      predefined refractive errors in a person's eyes. Thus, once
      prescribed and cut, corrective lenses are not adjustable to
      further other changes in a person's vision. An additional eye
      examination will be necessary to address these changes in the
      person's vision. What is needed therefore is an optical device
      which, in addition to corrective lenses, can easily provide yet
      another way for improving one's visual acuity over a range of
      distances.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">SUMMARY</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      The present invention provides for an optical device which
      includes at least two mechanisms for improving or enhancing one's
      visual acuity. The first mechanism is provided by one or more
      corrective lenses, which improve visual acuity by bending light in
      a way that causes it to be focused directly onto the retina. The
      second mechanism is provided by pinhole apertures, which improve
      visual acuity by reducing the width of the bundle of light rays
      entering the pupil of the eye. Pinhole apertures produce a sharper
      image on the retina by reducing the amount of peripheral light
      rays that enter into the eye. It is the peripheral light rays
      which require the most bending to produced a focused image and
      which are primarily responsible for blurred vision. A pinhole
      aperture may also be used to project a magnified image on the
      retina, and thereby allow viewing of smaller objects such as small
      type, than would otherwise be possible.<br>
      In one embodiment, an optical device is provided. The optical
      device comprises a first vision element comprising at least one
      corrective lens and a second vision element comprising at least
      one aperture coupled to the first vision element. The first and
      second vision element may each at least partially reduces a
      refraction error of a user's eye when either or both are
      positioned in front of the user's eye. The at least one aperture
      is characterized by a diameter and thickness (determined by the
      thickness of the material that the aperture pierces), wherein the
      thickness is no greater than the diameter. In the alternative, the
      corrective lens may be replaced by a non-refractive lens, for
      example a shaded lens as used in sunglasses.<br>
      <br>
      In another embodiment, a dual corrective eyewear is provided. The
      dual corrective eyewear comprises at least one lens; a frame
      supporting the lens; and at least one pinhole aperture disposed in
      the frame. The lens is configured to at least partially reduce a
      refraction error in a wearer's eyes by bending some of the light
      rays entering through the corrective lens and into the wearer's
      eye. The pinhole aperture is configured to at least partially
      reduce the refraction error in a wearer's eye by blocking some of
      the light rays from entering into the wearer's eye, to project a
      magnified image onto the user's retina, or both.<br>
      <br>
      There are certain disadvantages associated with the use of
      corrective lenses. Corrective lenses often produce glare and
      distortion. For example, multi-focal lenses, which are designed to
      provide a continuously variable curve for a range of distances,
      often provide distorted images on either side of the center line,
      which may be uncomfortable or difficult to get used to. Another
      disadvantage is that corrective lenses are limited to correcting a
      predefined refractive error and do not adapt to respond to changes
      in the visual acuity of the eye.<br>
      <br>
      Apertures, or pinhole apertures, on the other hand, are not
      associated with many of the problems inherent in corrective
      lenses. For example, apertures may provide an improved image at
      all distances, or over a greater range of distances, because they
      operate differently from corrective lenses. Apertures reduce the
      width of the bundle of diverging rays coming into a person's eye
      from each point on the viewed object. Normally, the full opening
      of the pupil admits light and it is the improper bending of the
      outermost peripheral light rays which causes refractive errors
      such as myopia, hyperopia, presbyopia and astigmatism to be
      noticeable. Apertures can therefore provide clearer vision in all
      of these conditions by blocking these peripheral rays and only
      letting into the eye those rays which pass through the central
      portion of the pupil. An aperture may also be used to produce a
      magnified or reduced image by varying the focal length, as applied
      in pinhole cameras, camera obscuras, or the like.<br>
      <br>
      As used herein, "apertures" or "pinhole apertures" are used to
      describe holes through which a person's line of sight may be
      directed and that function to reduce the bundle of light rays
      entering into the person's eye to produce a clearer or a magnified
      image. Apertures or pinhole apertures are characterized by shape
      having a diameter and a thickness. The apertures or pinhole
      apertures may be of any suitable shape, such as a circle, ellipse,
      triangle, square, rectangle, or other polygon, so long as it is
      configured to at least partially block some of the peripheral
      light rays from entering into the person's eye. Regularly-shaped
      apertures may be more useful than irregularly-shaped apertures.<br>
      <br>
      The diameter (d) of the aperture or pinhole apertures is defined
      as the largest distance that can be formed between two opposite
      points in the aperture. The diameter (d) should preferably be no
      greater than about 3 mm, preferably no greater than 2 mm, and more
      preferably no greater than 1 mm. In one aspect of the invention,
      the apertures or pinhole apertures have a diameter ranging from
      about 0.3 mm to about 2 mm, preferably about 0.5 mm to about 1.5
      mm, and more preferably from about 0.8 mm to about 1.2 mm.<br>
      <br>
      The thickness (t) of the aperture or pinhole aperture is the
      straight-line distance measured therethrough. The thickness (t)
      should preferably be no greater than the diameter (d) of the
      aperture or pinhole aperture. In one aspect, the ratio of the
      aperture diameter to thickness (d:t) should be no less than about
      1:1.5, preferably greater than 1:1, and more preferably greater
      than 2:1. Generally, the thinner the aperture, the better the
      visual acuity and light provided by the aperture to the eye.<br>
      <br>
      A plurality of apertures or pinhole apertures having a range of
      different diameters or thicknesses or both may be provided for
      viewing objects at various distances. The smaller openings may be
      used for viewing objects which are nearby, whereas the larger
      openings may be used for viewing distant objects. By providing a
      plurality of apertures of graduated sizes, the user can adjust the
      level of visual acuity obtained by selecting the appropriately
      sized aperture that provides an optically focused object. For
      convenience, the graduated apertures may be provided adjacent to
      one another through a common substrate. For example, apertures of
      different sizes may be arranged around a correcting lens of a pair
      of eyeglasses, through the eyeglasses frame.<br>
      <br>
      Despite the advantages provided by apertures, however, there are
      still situations in which use of corrective lenses may be
      preferable to apertures. For example, because apertures reduce the
      amount of light entering into the eye, they may not be suitable
      for use at night or in conditions of poor or dim lighting. In some
      instances, the aperture size may be increased to permit more light
      to enter into the eye; however, larger apertures will result in a
      reduction in image sharpness or resolution. Thus, corrective
      lenses should be used in conditions of poor or inadequate
      lighting. Apertures also do not provide improved peripheral
      vision. Thus, the use of corrective lenses is recommended when
      engaging in activities involving movement, such as driving.<br>
      <br>
      Thus a combination of corrective lenses and apertures may be used
      to provide improved visual acuity, not only over a range of
      distances but also over a range of conditions in which one or the
      other may be more suitable.<br>

        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br style="font-weight: bold;">
      The present inventions provide for an optical device that provides
      pinhole apertures together with an eyeglass frame. In some
      embodiments, at least two different mechanisms for improving or
      enhancing one's visual acuity: one or more corrective lenses and
      one or more optical apertures. In other embodiments, the pinhole
      apertures may be provided in a frame that holds non-corrective
      lenses, such as shaded lenses for sun protection, or clear lenses
      for style. In still other embodiments, the apertures may be
      provided in an eyeglass frame that is configured to hold a
      corrective or non-corrective lens, but in which no lens has yet
      been inserted. In still other embodiments, pinhole apertures may
      be provided in a visor or other appliance that is configured to
      clip or attach to an eyeglass frame. Any or all of these
      embodiments may be preferred, depending on the various anticipated
      needs or desires of the end user.<br>
      <br>
      Eyeglasses generally fall into three categories: full-rimmed,
      half-rimmed, wire-rimmed, and rimless. A full-rimmed eyeglass
      frame has a frame that completely encircles the lens. In a
      half-rimmed eyeglass frame, there is no frame on the bottom or top
      of the lens. In a wire-rimmed frame, the frame is constructed of a
      metal wire, which may be quite thin and lightweight. Rimless
      eyeglass frames generally have no frame around the lens and only a
      bridge connecting the lens pair and a pair of temples to support
      the lens on the user's face. The present invention may be provided
      in connection with any one of these eyeglass types.<br>
      FIGS. 1A-C show perspective views of various embodiments of
      full-rimmed frames with pinhole apertures. In FIGS. 1A-C,
      eyeglasses 100 comprise generally a corrective lens 120 that is
      supported in a frame 130. The frame 130 further comprises the
      frame front 132 surrounding the corrective lens 120, a bridge 134
      to connect the two corrective lens 120, an end piece 136, and a
      pair of temples 138 connected to the end piece 136 by a hinge 131.
      The frame 130 may be constructed from any suitable material known
      in the art, such as plastic, metal, metal alloy, and composites.
      Preferably, the area of the frame front 132 comprising the
      apertures 150 should preferably be opaque and be constructed of
      relatively thin material so as to reduce the resulting thickness
      (t) of the apertures 150. Additionally, this area should
      preferably be substantially opaque. For example, for an aperture
      diameter in the range of about 0.8-1.2 mm, the frame should be
      less than 2 mm thick in the area where the aperture is placed, and
      more preferably, less than 1 mm thick. Where it is desired to
      maintain a thicker frame for structural or aesthetic reasons, the
      frame may be locally thinned in a surrounding area where the
      aperture is placed.<br>
      <br>
      Referring now to the specific embodiments, FIG. 1A illustrates a
      full-rimmed eyeglass 100 having a plurality of pinhole apertures
      150 disposed in the frame front 132 surrounding the corrective
      lens 120 and in the bridge 134. Although the apertures 150 in FIG.
      1A are depicted as forming a single line around the corrective
      lens 120, the apertures 150 may also be provided in multiple rows
      as can be accommodated by the width of the frame front 132. If
      multiple rows of apertures are provided in the frame front 132,
      the apertures 150 in one row may be staggered with respect to the
      other rows. The pinhole apertures 150 may be the same size and
      shape, or may be provided in different sizes and/or shapes, for
      example, in graduated sizes.<br>
      <br>
      In this embodiment, the pinhole apertures and lens are not
      designed to be used simultaneously. By displacing the frame front
      132 from its normal resting position in any radial direction, a
      user may align one of the pinhole apertures with one or both eyes.
      This may be useful, for example, to read small type than cannot be
      read using the corrective lens 120. Also, a clear or shaded
      non-corrective lens may be substituted for the corrective lens
      120, with optical correction provided solely by the pinhole
      apertures. This may be useful to provide sunglasses or fashion
      eyewear with a universal corrective tool-the pinhole aperture-for
      sporadic reading or close inspection of small items.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 1B illustrates a full-rimmed eyeglass 100 in which a
      plurality of pinhole apertures 150 are provided at the bottom of
      the frame front 132. Although the plurality of pinhole apertures
      150 is depicted as being disposed in the bottom of the frame front
      132, it is understood that the pinhole apertures 150 may also be
      disposed in the top of the frame front 132.<br>
      <br>
      With regard to FIGS. 1A and 1B, providing pinhole apertures 150 at
      the top or bottom parts of the frame front 132 allow ease of use
      for the wearer to peer through the pinhole apertures 150. If the
      pinhole apertures 150 are located in the top section of the frame
      front 132, the wearer may direct his eyesight through the
      apertures by tilting his head forward and directing his line of
      sight upwards towards the pinhole apertures. The wearer may also
      position the eyeglasses 100 lower on the nose to position the
      pinhole apertures 150 directly in front of the wearer's eyes.
      Similarly, if the pinhole apertures 150 are located in the bottom
      section of the frame front 132, the wearer may direct his eyesight
      through the apertures by tilting his head backward and directing
      his line of sight downward towards the pinhole apertures 150. The
      wearer may also lift the glasses 100 higher on the nose to place
      the pinhole apertures 150 directly in front of the wearer's eyes.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 1C shows another embodiment of the eyeglasses 100 in which
      the pinhole apertures 150 are disposed in the frame temples 138.
      The embodiment depicted in FIG. 1C differs from the embodiments
      depicted in FIGS. 1A and B in that the wearer must first remove
      and rotate the eyeglasses 100 to position the frame temples 138
      having the pinhole apertures 150 in front of the wearer's eyes.
      Although the embodiment in FIG. 1C depict the pinhole apertures
      150 on both frame temples 138, it is understood that the pinhole
      apertures 150 may be provided on only a single frame temple 138.<br>
      <br>
      In embodiments where the pinhole apertures 150 are provided on
      both frame temples 138, a plurality of apertures 150 having a
      variety of diameters may be provided on the frame temples 138
      allowing a greater range of visual acuity. The apertures 150 may
      be graduated in size, with the smaller apertures on the bottom and
      the larger apertures on top, or vice versa. The smaller openings
      may be used for viewing objects which are nearby, whereas the
      larger openings may be used for viewing distant objects. By
      providing a plurality of apertures of graduated sizes, the user
      can adjust the level of visual acuity obtained by selecting the
      appropriately sized aperture that provides an optically focused
      object. The plurality of apertures may be provided along an axis
      that is roughly perpendicular to the user's line of sight and may
      increase or decrease in diameter along that axis.<br>
      <br>
      FIGS. 2A-B depict embodiments of the dual corrective eyewear 200
      comprising corrective lens 220 and a frame 230. The frame 230
      comprises a frame front 232, a bridge 234 and a pair of frame
      temples 238 that is connected to the frame front 232 by a hinge
      231. The hinge 231 permits the folding of the frame temples 238
      onto the frame front 232 for storage when the eyewear 200 is not
      in use. The frame front 232 further comprises a substantially
      opaque elongated bottom panel 240 which comprises pinhole
      apertures 240. The elongated bottom panel 240 preferably has a
      thickness that is no greater than the diameter of the pinhole
      apertures 240. In FIG. 2A, a single pinhole aperture 250 is
      provided for each eye on the bottom panel 240, whereas in FIG. 2B,
      a plurality of pinhole apertures 250 are provided for each eye on
      the bottom panel 240.<br>
      <br>
      It is understood that the number of pinhole apertures is not
      critical. In one aspect of this embodiment, the pinhole apertures
      are staggered and graduated. In the embodiments depicted in FIG.
      2B, because the pinhole apertures should optimally be positioned
      in front of the user's eyes and because the distance between the
      user's eyes may vary from person to person, providing a plurality
      of pinhole apertures may ensure that at least one pair of pinholes
      will be optimally positioned in front of the user's eyes. Also,
      providing a plurality of pinholes also allows more light to pass
      through.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 3A shows an embodiment of a wireframe or rimless dual
      corrective eyewear 300. In this embodiment, the eyewear 300
      comprises a pair of corrective lens 320, a bridge 340 that
      connects the corrective lens 320, and a pair of temples 360
      attached to the corrective lens 320. Because the eyewear 300 is
      rimless or framed using a thin wire, it does not have a frame into
      which pinhole apertures may be disposed. Accordingly, an opaque
      plate 380 comprising a plurality of pinhole apertures 350 may be
      provided on the temples 360. In one aspect of this embodiment, the
      opaque plate 380 may be removably attached to either or both of
      the temples 360 and may be constructed of thin material having a
      thickness no greater than 2 mm, preferably no greater than 1 mm,
      and more preferably no greater than 0.5 mm. In another aspect of
      this embodiment, the plate 380 may be integrally molded with the
      temples 360 and be constructed of a substantially opaque material.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 3B depicts a pinhole attachment piece 301 which may be
      removably attached to the corrective lens 320 of the wireframe or
      rimless corrective eyewear of the type depicted in FIG. 3A.
      Because rimless eyewear and wireframe eyewear do not have as many
      structural parts onto which pinhole apertures may be provided, a
      separate pinhole attachment piece 301 may be provided. Thus,
      providing the pinhole attachment piece 301 obviates the need to
      provide the plate 380 depicted in FIG. 3A.<br>
      <br>
      The pinhole attachment piece 301 comprises a pair of opaque lenses
      325, a connector 345 that couples the opaque lenses 325 and hooks
      335 disposed on the periphery of the opaque lenses 325. The hooks
      335 are configured to couple the pinhole attachment piece 301 onto
      a pair of rimless or wireframe eyeglasses of the type depicted in
      FIG. 3A. The opaque lenses 325 each comprise a plurality of
      pinhole apertures 355. In the alternative, each opaque lens may
      have only a single pinhole aperture located at or near the center
      of the lens to as to be more readily aligned with the wearer's
      eyes.<br>
      <br>
      A significant advantage in providing a pinhole attachment piece
      301 depicted in FIG. 3B in conjunction with a rimless or wireframe
      eyewear is that the wearer may obtain a benefit of improved visual
      acuity that results from viewing the object through both the
      corrective lens 320 of FIG. 3A and the pinhole apertures of FIG.
      3B simultaneously.<br>
      <br>
      In one embodiment, the plurality of pinhole apertures 355 may be
      of a single diameter. In another embodiment, the plurality of
      pinhole apertures 355 may be of diameters of different sizes. In
      this latter embodiment, the pinhole apertures 355 may be provided
      in accordance with a size gradient, with the smaller diameters at
      the bottom of the opaque lenses 325 and the larger diameters at
      the top of the opaque lenses 325. In a preferred embodiment, the
      opaque lenses 325 is constructed of thin material having a
      thickness no greater than 2 mm, preferably no greater than 1 mm,
      and more preferably no greater than 0.5 mm.<br>
      <br>
      FIGS. 1-3 depict the apertures as having a round shape. An
      advantage of having a round aperture is that it minimizes any
      higher-order diffraction effects. It is understood, however, that
      although FIGS. 1-3 depict round apertures, the apertures may also
      be configured in any shape, so long as that apertures are
      dimensioned to at least partially block out the peripheral light
      rays from entering into the eyes. Thus, the apertures may be
      characterized in accordance by its shape, diameter (d), and
      thickness (t). In the context of the apertures, the diameter (d)
      is defined as the largest distance that can be formed between two
      opposite points in the aperture shape.<br>
      <br>
      FIGS. 4A-F provide examples of aperture shapes that may be
      suitable for use in connection with the present invention. The
      apertures in FIGS. 4A-F are each characterized by a diameter (d)
      which is the largest distance that can be formed between two
      opposite points in the aperture shape. In most instances, the
      diameter may be measured directly or calculated based on at least
      one known variable.<br>
      <br>
      FIGS. 4A-B illustrate a circular aperture 400 and an elliptical
      aperture 402, respectively. As can be seen in these figures, the
      diameter (d) of the apertures define the largest distance and
      passes through the center of the apertures.<br>
      <br>
      FIGS. 4C-D illustrate a square aperture 404 and a rectangular
      aperture 406, respectively. In these apertures, the diameter (d)
      is defined as the distance between any one of the two opposing
      corners. For the square aperture in FIG. 4C, the diameter d may be
      calculated based on the length of the two sides: d=[square root
      of]{square root over (2l&lt;2&gt;)}. For the rectangular aperture
      in FIG. 4D, the diameter d may be calculated based on the length
      and height of the figure: d=[square root of]{square root over
      (l&lt;2&gt;+h&lt;2&gt;)}.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 4E illustrate a hexagonal aperture 408 having a diameter (d).
      Because calculating the diameter (d) becomes more difficult with
      polygons having more than four sides, direct measurement of the
      diameter (d) is preferred.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 4F illustrates a triangular aperture 410 having a diameter
      (d). In the case of equilateral and isosceles triangles, the
      diameter (d) may be calculated as follows:<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">[mathematical formula]</span><br>
      <br>
      <img style=" width: 203px; height: 107px;" alt=""
        src="us-line53.jpg"><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      The shape of the aperture is not critical, so long as the diameter
      (d) of the aperture is preferably no larger than about 2 mm.
      Generally, a smaller pinhole will result in better image
      resolution (sharper picture) as the projected circle of confusion
      is smaller at the image plane. An extremely small hole, however,
      can produce significant diffraction effects which will result in a
      less clear image. Thus, the diameter (d) should preferably be no
      greater than about 3 mm, preferably no greater than 2 mm, and more
      preferably no greater than 1 mm. In one aspect of the invention,
      the apertures or pinhole apertures have a diameter ranging from
      about 0.3 mm to about 2 mm, preferably about 0.5 mm to about 1.5
      mm, and more preferably from about 0.8 mm to about 1.2 mm.<br>
      Alternatively, the pinhole diameter may be provided by taking into
      account the focal length and the wavelength of light. One method
      of calculating the optimal pinhole diameter is: d=1.9[square root
      of]{square root over (f[lambda])}, where d is diameter, f is focus
      length (distance from hole to the retina) and [lambda] is the
      wavelength of light. For example, for a pinhole to retina distance
      of 1 inch, the pinhole diameter will be 0.22 mm for a wavelength
      of light corresponding to yellow-green 550 nm), and for a pinhole
      to retina distance of 5 cm, the pinhole diameter will be 0.32 mm
      for the same wavelength of light.<br>
      <br>
      In addition to the aperture shape and diameter, apertures are also
      generally characterized by a thickness (t), as shown in FIG. 5.
      The thickness (t) of the aperture 500 affects the amount of light
      that enters through the aperture and into the subject's eyes. As
      the diameter (d) of the aperture approaches the a thickness (t) of
      the material in which the aperture is provided, significant
      vignetting at the edges of the image will result, as less light
      will reach these areas. This is due to the shading effect of the
      sides of the hole for light coming in at other than a 90[deg.]
      angle. Thus, the aperture should be formed in as thin a material
      as possible. The thickness (t) should preferably be no greater
      than the diameter (d) of the aperture or pinhole aperture. In one
      aspect, the ratio of the aperture diameter to thickness (d:t)
      should be no less than about 1:1.5 66.7%), preferably greater than
      1:1, and more preferably greater than 2:1. Generally, the thinner
      the aperture, the better the visual acuity and light provided by
      the aperture to the eye, so long as the aperture is made in an
      opaque material.<br>
      <br>
      In some embodiments, it may be desirable to pierce a relatively
      thick material with a pinhole aperture. For example, a pinhole
      aperture may be placed through a relatively thick eyeglass frame
      as shown in FIGS. 1A-C. In such cases, it may be desirable to
      provide a localized thinning or opening of the frame in an area
      around the aperture, to maximize the aperture's effective
      diameter/thickness ratio. FIG. 6 shows an enlarged view, partial
      cross-section through a frame member 602 that is supporting a lens
      604. A pinhole aperture 606 is provided through a front surface
      608 of the frame member. Surface 608 is disposed away from the
      wearer's face (not shown) while surface 610 faces the wearer's
      face. A recess 612 may be provided in surface 608. Pinhole
      aperture 606 may pass from a bottom of the recess 612 through to
      the front surface 608. In this way, the ratio (d/t) may be
      maintained in a desired range.<br>
