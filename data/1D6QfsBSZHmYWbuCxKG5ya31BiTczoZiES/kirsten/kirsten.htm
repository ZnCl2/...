      <p><i>Airplane design faces radical change. Prof. Kirsten's
          cycloidal propeller is ready to emerge from the experimental
          stage into a safe, wingless craft. In Europe ships are being
          developed eliminating not only wings, but motors also. An
          Interview with F. K. KIRSTEN, Professor of Aeronautical
          Engineering University of Washington</i> </p>

      </center>
      <p>Picture yourself soaring over the Rockies in an airplane
        without fixed wings, with no propeller as you know the air screw
        today, yet climbing, diving, dashing ahead in level flight or
        actually stopping after the manner of a giant insect. </p>
      <p>There you have a preview of tomorrow's flight possibilities in
        heavier-than-air machines. Recently developed devices known as
        cycloidal propellers, projecting outward from the fuselage in
        the places where wings now are attached, serve not only to pull
        the cyclo-copter, the name given this machine, forward and up,
        but also to serve as both wings and air brakes when coming down
        to a safe three-point landing. This machine may be equipped with
        a standard propeller in the nose. It then is called a
        cyclo-gyro.&lt;/p&gt; </p>
      <p>For 15 years Prof. F. K. Kirsten of the University of
        Washington has investigated the possibilities of cyloidal
        propulsion and sustentation. It suggested itself to him while he
        was engaged in an attempt to analyze the flight of birds.
        Speculation as to the characteristics of the actual path traced
        in the air by the tip of the bird's wing led him to conclude
        that this path might resemble the path of a cycloid, which finds
        expression in the cycloidal propeller, in which several flat
        surfaces, or wings, are rotated about a center. </p>
      <p>Birds, we know, possess the powers of sustentation --- the lift
        of an airplane wing --- and propulsion --- speed from the
        propeller --- in the same mechanism, the wings. Too, birds are
        far more versatile than airplanes in their ability to take off
        and land and to engage in rapid flight. </p>
      <p>Here is another important point, which in the past has not been
        even remotely approached in fixed-wing airplanes; birds have
        neither rudder nor ailerons, although they do possess a
        horizontal stabilizing fin in the form of tails. They accomplish
        every manner of control, including pitch, roll and yaw so
        familiar to airplane pilots, by moving the wing system. </p>
      <p>"Thus the new cyclo-copter," Professor Kirsten told me, with
        which we are now experimenting at the Guggenheim Aeronautical
        Laboratory, University of Washington, possesses a rotating
        wing-propeller system as in birds and gives us the advantages of
        free flight enjoyed by those inhabitants of the air. </p>
      <p>Its interconnected plane surfaces, representing a bird wing, by
        their interrelated motions as they revolve, react upon the air
        in such a way as to derive effects of lift and propulsion quite
        like those achieved by a bird's wings. </p>
      <p>When fitted as a cyclo-gyro, the air screw and the cycloidal
        propellers are turned independently. In this case the air blast
        from the propeller starts the blades turning. Whereas the screw
        may turn up to 2,000 r.p.m., the cycloidal propeller will
        deliver adequate thrust and lift while revolving only 350 r.p.m.
      </p>
      <p>Blades of the cycloidal propeller on this astounding new craft
        are so arranged mechanically that each makes a half turn for
        every revolution of the entire propeller. In level flight, for
        instance, the blade at the bottom of the circle stands on edge,
        presenting a flat surface to the air stream. This enables it to
        deliver maximum thrust in pushing the machine forward. If that
        blade is moving backward at a rate of 100 miles an hour, the top
        blade, which is now lying horizontal in the air stream, is
        moving forward 200 miles an hour with respect to the air ---
        speed of the propeller blades on their orbit plus the speed of
        the machine which supports it. This gives the top blades four
        times as great a lift per unit area than for a fixed wing.
        Together, these tiny wings operate with superior efficiency in
        propulsions and furnish the required lift at the same time. </p>
      <p>"It will not be necessary to fit these machines with
        propellers", Professor Kirsten told me, over the whir of the
        air-screw spinning on the model. "Experiments indicate the
        rotors alone will give them positive control, greater stability
        than theretofore has been possible, and an ability to land
        almost vertically even should the power plant fail. The
        cyclo-gyro model already built represents a one-sixth scale
        replicum of a 10-passenger transport plane. Later a full-size
        craft will be constructed. An entirely new flying technique will
        be used by pilots." </p>
      <p><b>Cyclo-Gyro Has No Rudder</b> </p>
      <p>Since it does not employ a rudder, the pilot merely turns the
        wheel right and left for turns and banks, moves it forward and
        backward to glide or climb, stated Prof. Kirsten. </p>
      <p>When he turns the wheel left, for instance, control wires cause
        the angles of the blades in the propellers to be changed in
        opposite directions, raising the right side and lowering the
        left. Meantime the tail propellers serve to align the body of
        the machine in straight flight. Such is the accuracy and
        positiveness of control that a stabilizing vertical fin becomes
        unnecessary. </p>
      <p>Merely by turning a small wheel the pilot can change the thrust
        on the blades, now driving forward in level flight, again
        hovering over a single spot like a bird. </p>
      <p>By making adequate changes in the propeller system to achieve
        high pitch," said Prof. Kirsten, "there seems to be no limit to
        speed attainable. I am sure we can reach speeds and altitudes
        exceeding those so far attained by fixed-wing airplanes, at the
        same time retaining the safety and controllability so necessary
        at low speeds. Whereas the airliner of today lands at a speed
        exceeding in most cases a mile a minute, the cycloidal craft may
        be brought to earth with little if any forward momentum, much as
        the autogyro lands." </p>
      <p><b>Possible Wartime Uses</b> </p>
      <p>Too, the cycloidal machine promises valuable military
        possibilities. Most of the noise of present airplanes comes from
        rhythmic impulses imparted by propellers to the air. The
        frequency of the sound made by the cycloidal propeller is too
        low to be heard. The cycloidal machine may hover over an enemy,
        silent as the night, while observers take note of movements on
        the ground. Its mission accomplished, it can speed away to
        safety faster than any airplanes yet constructed. </p>
      <p>Further, for fighting purposes, since the vision from the
        pilot's cockpit is unobstructed by wings, due to the rapid
        motion of the cycloidal propellers, and since there is no
        propeller in front of the cockpit to interfere, machine guns of
        adjustable sweep may be installed. </p>

      <p>This invention relates to aircraft propulsion and more
        particularly to aircraft propellers of that class known in the
        art as ‘cycloidal propellers’ wherein a plurality of propeller
        blades extend normal to the surface of a rotor, and wherein any
        point in the axis of any blade will describe the path of a
        prolate cycloid, when the slip of the propeller is zero, and
        wherein the blades rotate in their mountings in accordance with
        the rotation of the rotor to so align themselves that the planes
        of their median chords remain tangent to the prolate cycloid. </p>
      <p>Explanatory to the invention it will here be stated that the
        most important consideration&nbsp; in the design of a cycloidal
        propeller is the required pitch. The pitch ratio of a screw
        propeller has been defined as the advance per revolution in
        propeller diameters of the screw as a whole at zero slip.
        Applying the same definition to cycloidal propellers, the pitch
        ratio of a pure cycloidal propeller is pi, since the length of a
        cycloid period is equal to pi times the diameter of the
        generating circle. A cycloidal path is described by a point on
        the periphery of a wheel which rolls on a plane. The distance
        covered by the center of the wheel, or the wheel as a whole, per
        revolution is pi times the diameter; hence the pitch ratio of a
        cycloidal propeller representing the blade orbit as the rim of a
        wheel and rolling on a plane tangent to the blade orbit is pi or
        the advance per revolution of the propeller as a whole in orbit
        diameters. </p>
      <p>The curve generated by a point on the periphery of a wheel
        rolling on a plane is the path of a pure cycloidal curve. If,
        however, this wheel were attached concentrically to a larger
        wheel rolling on a plane, a point on the periphery of the
        smaller wheel will generate a prolate cycloidal path. Hence
        cycloidal propellers may be regrouped into three classes, viz.,
        the pure, the prolate, and the curtate. </p>
      <p>In the cycloidal propeller the alignment of blades at all
        points along the cycloidal path for zero slip must be such that
        no force reaction normal to the path can result. This naturally
        requires a different blade movement for the curtate cycloid than
        for the pure cycloid pr prolate cycloid. For the prolate cycloid
        propeller, to which the present invention applies, the blades
        must rotate about their own axes at the same speed as the
        propeller rotor, or while the propeller rotor makes one
        revolution the blade must also make a full revolution. However,
        a uniform blade rotation is feasible only for the pure cycloidal
        propeller, for the prolate cycloidal propeller modifications
        must be applied to the blade actuating mechanism so that the
        blade alignment is correct for all point on the cycloidal path.
        It must have a blade rotational speed equal to that of the
        rotor, but this rotational speed must be retarded until the
        cycloid interests a plane parallel to the plane on which the
        generating circle rolls and located at a definite distance above
        that plane. For the remainder of the half cycle the rotational
        speed of the blades must be increased. </p>
      <p>In view of the above it has been the principal object of this
        invention to provide a suitable and practical blade control
        mechanism for propellers of the prolate cycloid type whereby
        rotational speed of the blades may be controlled as above
        stated; thereby to change and control the pitch by an
        oscillating adjustment of the blades in their mountings effected
        automatically incident to rotation of the rotor. </p>
      <p>Another object of the invention reside in the combination and
        arrangement of parts whereby the change and control of pitch and
        axis of symmetry may be effected with the propeller in motion. </p>
      <p>Other objects of the invention reside in the details of
        construction and in the combination of parts and in their mode
        of operation, as will hereinafter be described. </p>
      <p>In accomplishing the various objects of the invention, we have
        provided the improved details of construction, the preferred
        forms of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings
        wherein --- </p>

      <p><b>Figure 5</b> is an outside, or face view of a part of the
        propeller with the part of the housing broken away for better
        illustration of interior parts. </p>
      <p>Before going into a description of the mechanism, as disclosed
        in Figures 4 and 5, the invention will be explained with
        reference to the illustration of Figure 3. In this view, the
        dotted lie X represents the prolate cycloidal path penetrated by
        a point p on the periphery of an orbit A fixed concentric of a
        wheel C rolling on plane c-c. Applying the present construction
        to the diagram and assuming the orbit A to represent the circle
        in which the propeller blades of the rotor are mounted, all
        points in the axes of the blades b rotate for a given instant
        about the point of contact T of the imaginary wheel C rolling on
        plane c-c without slippage. The curtate cycloid will be normal
        to a line l between point of contact T and the axis of blade b.
        The plane f of the median chord of the blade will be tangent to
        the prolate chord and therefore normal to the said line l. </p>
      <p>The present invention takes into consideration the fact that
        the plane f of the median chord of the blade should be
        maintained normal to the line l except for a limited compromise
        whereby blade alignment is corrected for all points on the
        cycloidal curve thereby provided a very close approach to the
        pitch ration of pi. </p>
      <p>Referring more in detail to the drawings --- </p>
      <p>1 designates a supporting frame structure for the propeller.
        This structure may be embodied in or may constitute a part of
        the fuselage 2 of the airplane, and fixed therein is a bearing
        sleeve 3 within which is rotatably mounted the spindle portion 4
        of the propeller rotor designated in its entirety by numeral 5.
      </p>
      <p>The rotor is circular and concentric of the spindle 4 and it
        comprises, at its center, a hub housing 6 with which the spindle
        4 is integrally formed. At the outer portion of the rotor a
        plurality of propeller blade mounting sleeves 7 are supported by
        brace bars 8; these bars being fixed at their inner ends to
        flanges 9 on the hub housing 6 and at their outer ends are fixed
        to the sleeves 7 thereby to rigidly maintain the latter equally
        spaced apart, also equally spaced from and axially parallel to
        the axis of the rotor. </p>
      <p>Keyed on the inner end of the spindle 4 is a beveled gear 10
        and meshing therewith is a beveled gear10 and meshing therewith
        is a beveled driving pinion 11 fixed on the end of a driving
        shaft 12 that extends from the engine, or source of power, not
        herein shown; this shaft being rotatably supported adjacent the
        gear 11 in a bearing 13 that is fixed to frame structure 1. </p>
      <p>Rotatably fitted in the several sleeves 7 at the periphery of
        the rotor are the mounting journals 14 of the propeller blades
        15, and at the inner end of each journal is a reduced shank 16
        on which a beveled pinion 17, for rotating the blade, is fixed.
      </p>
      <p>Mounted radially of the rotor are blade control shafts 18
        revolubly supported at their outer ends in bearings 19 formed
        integral with the inner end portions of the sleeves 7, and, at
        their inner ends, extending into the hub housing 6 through
        supporting bearings 20 integral with the housing. Fixed on the
        outer end of each shaft 18 is a beveled pinion gear 21 in mesh
        with the pinion gear 17 of the corresponding blade. Likewise,
        fixed on the inner ends of the shafts 18 are beveled pinion
        gears 22 meshing with beveled gears 24 that are located within
        housing 6 and keyed on supporting shafts 25; these supporting
        shafts being rotatably supported at their opposite ends
        respectively in the inner and outer walls 6a and 6b of the hub
        housing 6, and are equally spaced apart about the rotor axis and
        equally spaced from the axis. </p>
      <p>Coaxial of the spindle 4 is a tubular shaft 28 revolubly
        supported in bushings 29 and 30 applied to the spindle ends. At
        the inner end of the shaft 28 and fixed thereto is a gear 31. At
        the outer end of the shaft is an adjusting gear 32 in mesh with
        and normally held against rotation by an intermeshing worm gear
        33 on a shaft 34 which provides, as presently understood, for
        adjustment of the axes of symmetry of the propeller. </p>
      <p>Rotatably mounted on each of the several shafts 25 is a gear
        35. All of these are of the same diameter and all mesh with the
        gear 31 to provide a planetary motion thereof about the gear 31,
        and the relation of diameters of the gears 35 to that of gear 31
        is such that, with the gear 31 held against rotation, the gears
        35 will be caused to rotate exactly once about their supporting
        shafts 25 for each rotation of the rotor about its axis. </p>
      <p>Each gear 35 has a bevel gear 38 fixed relative thereto at the
        outer end of its hub portion and this gear is in mesh with
        spider gears 39 revoluble on spindles 40 that extend radially
        from the shaft 25 about which the gears 35 and 38 rotate. The
        spider gears also are in mesh with bevel gears 42 integral with
        the inner end portions of guide blocks 43 mounted on the outer
        end portions of the shafts 25. </p>
      <p>The gearing arrangement above described provides that with the
        gears 42 held relatively stationary, for each rotation of the
        rotor about its axis, the shafts 25, through the mediacy of the
        spider gears 39 and gears 31, 35,and 38 will be rotated once
        about their axes for each two rotations of the propeller. Also,
        the relationship of the gears connecting the shafts 25 and
        propeller blades is such that the propeller blades will be
        rotated once with uniform motion about their axes for each
        rotation of the shaft 25 and therefore once for each rotation of
        the propeller. </p>
      <p>Superimposed upon their uniform relative motion provided in the
        gearing above described is an oscillating motion transmitted to
        the blades by a mechanism embodying the present invention
        whereby change in pitch of the propeller is effected. This
        mechanism, as shown in Figures 4 and 5, comprises a forked bar
        48 for each blade mechanism; the forked outer ends of the bars
        being slidable through their corresponding guide blacks 43 and
        their inner ends being pivotally mounted on a stud 49 eccentric
        of the rotor and integral with a cross head 50 that is slidably
        movable in a quideway 51 in a direction diametrically of the
        rotor; the guideway 51 being integral with the gear 31 and held
        against rotation thereby. </p>
      <p>This means of connection provides that, with the stud 49
        relatively stationary, and the rotor rotating on its axis, the
        forked guide bars 48 will cause oscillation of their respective
        guide blocks 43 both in a clockwise and a counter-clockwise
        direction for each rotation of the rotor. The spider gears 39
        associated with the gears 42 on the blacks cause the shafts 25
        to oscillate with half the angular velocity of the oscillating
        guide blocks, and the relationship of gearing that is
        intermediate the shafts 25 and their corresponding blades causes
        the blades, while rotating once about their axes with each
        rotation of the propeller, to be subjected to oscillations of
        the same angular velocity of their respective guide blacks 43;
        the extent of oscillation being determined by the distance of
        spacing or eccentricity of the stud 49 from the axis of rotation
        of the rotor and decreases and increases in accordance with the
        movement of the stud towards and from the axis. </p>
      <p>The means for shifting the cross head in its guideway, thereby
        to shift the eccentric stud, comprises a shaft 60 coaxial of
        tubular shaft 28 and rotatable in bushings 61 and 62 fitted in
        opposite ends of shaft 28. At its inner end, shaft 60 has a
        pinion gear 63 fixed thereon in mesh with a rack 64 on the cross
        head, At its outer end the shaft 60 is equipped with a worm gear
        65 which is held normally against rotation by an intermeshing
        worm gear 66 on a shaft 67. </p>
      <p>Rotation of shaft 66 effects rotation of gear 63 and this,
        through the mediacy of the rack 64, raises or lowers the cross
        head accordingly and thereby shifts the stud 49 toward or away
        from the axis of the rotor thereby to regulate the extent of the
        oscillating action of the blades. </p>
      <p>It is apparent that this arrangement of mechanism, as applied
        to the diagram of Figure 3&nbsp; provides for changing the
        diameter of the imaginary wheel C and therefore controls the
        pitch of the propeller. Also, since the axis of symmetry is
        defined as a line drawn through the center of the propeller
        through the point of contact T, this is controlled by the worm
        33, worm gear 32, shaft 28 and gear 31, which mounts the cross
        head guide 51. Thus by revolving the parts 31, 51, 50 and 49,
        the axis of symmetry is controlled. </p>

        therein and desire to secure by Letters Patent is --- [ Not

      <p>This invention relates to aircraft, and more, particularly to
        aircraft of the heavier than air types employing cycloidal
        propulsion devices; the objects of the invention residing in the
        design, relationship and use of cooperatively arranged cycloidal
        propellers for propulsion stabilization and control of aircraft
        in flight. </p>
      <p>It is recognized that propellers of that type known as
        ‘cycloidal propellers’ have heretofore been applied to aircraft
        and it is not the intention of this application to seek patent
        protection on that type of propeller, per se, but rather on the
        novel use of cycloidal propellers, as applied in a certain
        relationship to each other and to the fuselage of the craft in
        which they are used, thereby to obtain maximum efficiency for
        propulsion and sustentation as well as to make possible perfect
        control of the craft in taking off, while in flight, and in
        landing. </p>
      <p>In order to impart a better understanding of the present
        invention it will here be stated that during the past year much
        publicity has been given to cycloidal propulsion projects of
        heavier than air craft. One of the first to appear in various
        publications was a development of the Rohrbach machine in
        Germany. Another was a machine built and tested in France by
        Standgren. A third, which has appeared in the technical press.
        Is the Platt machine developed in the United States. Also, much
        prominence has been given recently to cycloidal propulsion in
        articles appearing in journals of the American Society of
        mechanical Engineers under the heading of ‘Engineering
        Progress’. However, no machine, to my knowledge, has used
        cycloidal propellers in the present cooperative relationship for
        purpose of stabilization, propulsion, and flight control. </p>
      <p>In the known machines, above mentioned, there are certain
        inherent defects which have been eliminated in the present
        construction. For instance, in the Rohrbach and Strandgran
        machines, the propellers are set out from and entirely cleat of
        the body structure, or fuselage, and there are long cylindrical
        propeller shafts extending into the slip stream, adding much
        resistance to flight. In the Rohrbach machine in particular
        there are a great many strut supports for the propeller blades
        and this is contrary to modern aircraft practice which seeks to
        eliminate all parts from the slip stream which do not contribute
        to propulsion and sustentation. The Strandgren machine employs
        two propellers with short blades and of large rotor diameter
        which design has also proven to be faulty, particularly because
        of end losses of its many short blades and its dependence on
        slip stream momentum for both propulsion and sustentation. </p>
      <p>In view of the objectionable and impractical features proven to
        exist in cycloidal propellers of prior machines, it has been the
        principal object of this invention to overcome them to a maximum
        extent by use of cycloidal propellers at opposite sides of the
        body or fuselage of the craft, each comprising a rotor set flush
        with the surface of the craft to avoid any possible interference
        or resistance to flight, and equipped with propeller blades of
        the cantilever type wherein each blade projects from the
        fuselage as a monoplane wing. </p>
      <p>The invention also provides both front and rear sets of
        propellers, with those of the rear set coupled with those of the
        front or forward set, in such manner that the blade speed of all
        propellers is of the same magnitude and both sets operate to
        produce a lift in normal flight. Also, the invention provides
        for differentially controlling the blade angle of the propellers
        so that they may additionally function both as ailerons and
        rudder. </p>
      <p>Other objects of the invention reside in the details of
        construction and in the combination of parts and mode of use, as
        will hereinafter be described. </p>
      <p>In accomplishing these and other objects of the invention, I
        have provided the improved details of construction, the
        preferred forms of which are illustrated in the accompanying
        drawings, wherein --- </p>

      <p>Referring more in detail to the drawings --- </p>
      <p>1 designates the fuselage, or body, of an airplane which may be
        similar to or one of those of present day design and 2
        designates its engine, or power plant, with drive shaft 3
        extended in the central longitudinal plane of the craft for
        operative connection with the forward and rearward sets of
        cycloidal propellers, as presently described. </p>
      <p>The two propellers A and A’, comprising the forward set, are
        located toward the forward end of the fuselage and at opposite
        sides thereof, as shown in Figure 1, and the propellers B and
        B’, comprising the rearward set, are similarly located near the
        rear end or in the tail of the fuselage. Briefly, each propeller
        comprises a rotor 4 from which extend a plurality of propeller
        blades 5, arranged in a circle concentric of the rotor. These
        blades are of the cantilever type and diverge slightly and
        uniformly from the axis of rotation. Each blade 5 has a journal
        6 at its inner end whereby it is rotatably mounted in a bearing
        sleeve 7 carried at the periphery of the rotor and each rotor
        has a tubular mounting spindle 8 coaxial thereof whereby it is
        revolubly supported in a frame structure 9 through the mediacy
        of antifriction bearings 10 and 11, as seen in Figure 5; the
        frame 9 constituting a part of or is fixed solidly within the
        fuselage. Fixed on the inner ends, the spindles 8 of paired
        rotors, respectively, are beveled gears 12 and 13 which mesh
        respectively with beveled driving gears 14 and 15 on the motor
        shaft 3; these intermeshing gears being so arranged and in such
        relative proportion that they will impart rotary motion to the
        rotors in the same direction and at the same speed. </p>
      <p>Rotatably contained coaxially within the spindles 8-8 of the
        forward pair of rotors are shafts 18-18’ which, at their inner
        ends have worm gears 19-19’ fixed thereon in mesh with worm
        gears 20-20’ on adjusting shafts 21-21’. At their outer ends are
        bevel gears 22, normally held against rotation by reason of the
        worm gears 20-20 but rotatably adjustable by rotative adjustment
        of shafts 21 and 21’. </p>
      <p>Extending radially of the rotors from the center to each of the
        propeller blades, are blade adjusting shafts 25 rotatably
        supported in bearings 26 in the rotor structure. At the inner
        end of each shaft 25 is a bevel gear 27 meshing with the
        centrally located gear 22, and fixed on the outer end of each
        shaft 25 is a bevel gear 28 meshing with a bevel gear 29 fixed
        on the spindle 6 of the corresponding blade. The relationship
        and relative sizes of the several gears is such that, with the
        gears 22 held against rotation, the blades will be caused to
        rotate once on their axes for each rotation of the rotor and in
        a direction opposite thereto. Rotatable adjustment of the worm
        gears 20 and 20’ will effect adjustment of the pitch of the
        blades, and the control device is such that the blades may be
        differentially or uniformly adjustable through geared connection
        with the shafts 21 and 21 ‘. </p>
      <p>The outside of each rotor is covered by a smooth, flat disk 32
        and this is flush with the side surface of the fuselage, as
        shown in Figure 5. Also the axes of paired rotors are similarly
        upwardly inclined from the vertical longitudinal plane of the
        fuselage to form a dihedral that is very desirable from the
        aerodynamic standpoint and at the same time creates a very
        convenient compartment due to the spread of the lower portion of
        the rotors which can be utilized for the variable fuel load and
        thus placing the variable load directly in line with the
        principal lift reactions. </p>
      <p>In all aircraft, freedom and control of motion about and along
        the three axes of space are required. Granting that the motion
        of the cycloidal aircraft in a horizontal plane, in a vertical
        place through the major axis of the craft and in a vertical
        plane through the propeller axes is as readily achieved as with
        the airplane, there still remains the problem of pitching,
        rolling, and yawing motions and their control. </p>
      <p>For the present use type of cycloidal aircraft, pitching is
        induced by the torque of the blades. This pitching moment is
        automatically stabilized by placing the center of gravity a
        sufficient distance below the horizontal axes of the propeller
        rotors. An increase in torque will tend to swing the mass of the
        vehicle about the axis of the propeller in a direction opposite
        to that of the direction of rotation of the rotor. If the
        topmost blades are made to move in the same direction as the
        vessel, an increase in torque will displace the center of
        gravity forward of the pitching axis. This displacement creates
        a gravitational restoring moment, making the system stoically
        stable. However, as the vessel swings through the displacement
        angle, the blades are also turned an angle with respect to their
        former position unless they can be automatically prevented from
        being influenced by the pitching of the vessel. This increased
        angle of attack increases the propeller torque still more, which
        again increases the propeller torque still more, which again
        increases the displacement of the center of gravity.
        Consequently, this arrangement appears to be dynamically
        unstable in pitching. The same results are obtained by an
        analysis of operation under negative slip propellers.
        Consequently, for cycloidal aircraft which depend only upon a
        favorable location of the center of gravity for pitching
        control, a horizontal tail surface must be provided. In the
        present instance the rearward pair of cycloidal propellers B and
        B’ take the place of the horizontal tail surface, and is the
        means for controlling pitching. As shown in Figure 4, the rear
        pair of cycloidal propellers is coupled with the front pair and
        in such a way that the blade speeds of all propellers are of the
        same magnitude. An increase of torque in the front propellers
        automatically increases the torque of the rear propellers in the
        same proportion. The rear propellers are arranged to produce a
        lift in normal flight, that is; both pairs of propellers are
        lifting surfaces. The lift of the rear propellers multiplied by
        the distance between centers of front and rear propellers must
        be equal to the torque of the motor for static stability. </p>
      <p>Assuming now that the torque on the front propellers suddenly
        increases, the rear propellers receive a downward impulse but
        the slightest downward motion increase the angle of attack of
        the rear propeller blades. This increases the lift and thus the
        counter torque on the front propellers. Hence, this system is
        automatically stable. </p>
      <p>Since the blade setting of both sets of propellers is
        controlled by the pilot, the attitude of the craft in flight may
        be adjusted at will. Normally the tail propeller control will be
        coupled with the blade control of the main or forward
        propellers. However, linkage between the two controls may be
        made adjustable so as to simulate the adjustability of the
        airplane elevators. Rolling stability depends on the adjustment
        of the blade control for both the starboard and port propellers.
        Once this adjustment is perfected for operation on an even keel
        no further balancing mechanisms are required. The slight
        dihedral in the exes of each pair of propellers is of help in
        securing dynamic stability. But the most effective recovery
        movements are the forces dynamically acting on the blades due to
        a change in the inflow direction of air when a rolling movement
        takes place. These recovery movements are very large since the
        change of inflow direction effects mainly the upper blades, the
        velocities of which are usually more than twice the velocity of
        the vessel. Consequently, the present cycloidal aircraft is also
        statically and dynamically stable in rolling. </p>
      <p>An analysis for yawing movements of cycloidal aircraft is
        somewhat more involved than for the analysis for pitching and
        rolling. The lift at any slip increases in direct proportion to
        the angle of blade setting or the shift of the axis of symmetry
        of the blades from the plane normal to the inflow direction.
        Similarly, the thrust at all slips increases as the angle of
        blade setting increases from zero to about fifteen degrees, at
        which it reaches a maximum for a given blade speed. If the
        setting of this angle for cycloidal propellers is at values
        below fifteen degrees in normal flight, any small change in this
        angle in the positive direction increases both lift and thrust,
        and a change in the negative direction decreases both lift and
        thrust. Hence, if the controls of the propellers are
        differentially coupled; namely, so that the pilot can increase
        the angle of setting for the starboard propeller and decrease it
        the same amount for the port propeller, or vice versa, the
        yawing control is completely established, If he wishes to turn
        to port, the angle is increased for the starboard propeller and
        decreased for the port propeller. This increases the thrust on
        the starboard side and decreases the thrust on the port side, at
        the same time creating the starboard banking attitude of the
        vessel on its curved flight path. For this maneuver no rudder is
        required. This demonstrates that differentially controlled
        cycloidal propellers perform the function of both the ailerons
        and rudder of the airplane, and that the cycloidal ship is
        statically stable in yawing. </p>
      <p>In order to make it dynamically stable, a vertical fin, as
        designated at 40, is attached to the rear of the vessel.
        However, this fin may not be necessary of the ship is so built
        that it presents sufficient vertical surface in its body to
        accomplish the same results. </p>
      <p>For differentially controlling the blade angle adjustment of
        paired propellers, the shafts 18 and 18’ are rotated in opposite
        directions from a neutral setting. To change the angle of
        symmetry for the propeller blades, the shafts 18 and 18’ are
        rotatably adjusted in unison. For this latter adjustment, the
        shafts 21 and 21’ are extended, as seen in Figure 6, and are
        equipped with bevel pinions 45 and 45’ meshing with bevel gears
        46 and 46’ and has a gear 49 thereon in mesh with gears 46 and
        46’. Oscillation of the shaft effects a simultaneous rotation of
        the gears 45 and 45’ and a similar rotative adjustment of the
        worm gears to thereby change the angle of symmetry of both
        propellers to the same extent. Rotation of the control shaft in
        opposite direction by means of the wheel 50 at its end effects
        an opposite rotative adjustment of the worm gears and a
        differential adjustment of the propeller blade angles. </p>
