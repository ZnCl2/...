      <b>... No Emissions.</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Unlike traditional hydrogen production processes that emit 5
      kilograms of greenhouse gases for every 1 kilogram of hydrogen
      produced, Hydrogen 2.0 production processes can generate hydrogen
      without the use of chemicals or electrolysis. There’s no new
      greenhouse gases, no emissions, no particulates, no heavy metals,
      and no negative environmental impact.<br>
      <br>
      The consumption of hydrogen fuel returns only water back into the
      atmosphere...<br>
      <br>
      <b>Cost Competitive.</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Hydrogen 2.0 is designed to be produced in abundance on a
      cost-competitive basis. Since Hydrogen 2.0 is made from nature’s
      most abundant resources, it won’t require expensive exploration or
      drilling and is available 24/7.<br>
      <br>
      The benefits of Hydrogen 2.0 can be shared worldwide without the
      need for the highly expensive infrastructure required for the
      transportation and distribution of traditional hydrogen, making it
      ideal for developing economies. ..<br>

      <div align="center"><b>NB Power Licenses Mystery Tech to Build a
          Hydrogen-Powered Electricity Grid</b><br>
      </div>
      <div align="center"><i>The Canadian utility has invested millions
          to use Joi Scientific’s hydrogen process.</i><br>
        <b>Jason Deign </b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Canadian utility New Brunswick Power has invested millions of
      dollars to license a mysterious hydrogen production technology
      being developed by the Florida-based company Joi Scientific.<br>
      <br>
      The two companies last month said the deal would help NB Power
      develop the world’s first hydrogen-powered distributed electricity
      grid.<br>
      <br>
      But the deployment of hydrogen production stations on the NB Power
      grid is dependent on Joi Scientific being able to scale up its
      technology, which is still in the laboratory phase.<br>
      <br>
      Executives at NB Power and Joi Scientific refused to disclose the
      value of the deal, but did not dispute a published figure of CAD
      $13 million (USD $9.8 million).<br>
      <br>
      The partnership was slammed by Canadian Green Party leader David
      Coon, who told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) that NB
      Power did not have a mandate “to be acting like an angel investor
      in someone’s project in Florida.”<br>
      <br>
      The technology espoused by Joi Scientific “remains a mystery,” he
      said.<br>
      <br>
      Coon declined to comment further for GTM. But CBC confirmed that
      searches by scientists at the University of Moncton in New
      Brunswick had failed to turn up papers relating to the process.
      The heads of Joi Scientific and NB Power remained tight-lipped
      over the details.<br>
      <br>
      “We’re specifically not talking about how the technology works
      because there is additional work we are doing,” said Traver
      Kennedy, Joi Scientific’s CEO and the former chief strategist at
      Citrix Systems, a technology company.<br>
      <br>
      Gaëtan Thomas, NB Power’s president and CEO, revealed the
      technology involved “a nanopulse-driven signal that basically
      allows [us] to get hydrogen out of saltwater. It’s almost
      mind-boggling how it works.”<br>
      <br>
      Joi Scientific, which in 2016 raised almost $5 million from
      investors including GoPro backer Dean Woodman, has six U.S.
      patents, Kennedy said, and would be publishing scientific papers
      on the process “perhaps as early as next year.”<br>
      <br>
      <b>Modular hydrogen production</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The company describes its technology as a modular hydrogen
      production unit or system that could provide fuel to drive engines
      or fuel cells. The units would be housed in containers resembling
      server racks, said Kennedy.<br>
      <br>
      The production process is not based on electrolysis and has no
      negative environmental impact, according to Joi Scientific’s
      website. Also, unlike electrolysis, the process uses seawater
      instead of pure water, Kennedy said.<br>
      <br>
      Nor does it involve a surface reaction, he revealed. “We’ve been
      able to make our system smaller and smaller and yet increase the
      production of hydrogen,” he commented.<br>
      <br>
      Thomas said he hoped that at scale the process would be able to
      produce hydrogen at a cost competitive with fossil fuels. He cited
      an all-in levelized cost of between 5 cents and 8 cents per
      kilowatt-hour (4 cents to 6 cents USD).<br>
      <br>
      Both companies insisted NB Power had carried out exhaustive due
      diligence on Joi Scientific’s hydrogen concept. The license
      signing followed two years of scalability testing on the process,
      said Kennedy.<br>
      <br>
      <b>A calculated risk</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      As part of the agreement, NB Power is working alongside Joi
      Scientific’s team at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida to build
      a scaled-up prototype for field trials on the utility’s grid,
      possibly within a year.<br>
      <br>
      Commercialization of small hydrogen production units might take
      one or two years, said Thomas at NB Power. Ultimately, Joi
      Scientific helps to scale the process up to plants with a capacity
      of 100 megawatts. Thomas said this could take three to five years.<br>
      <br>
      NB Power is hoping to use the technology to decarbonize its
      generation portfolio. A key goal is to use hydrogen to replace
      coal at NB Power’s 467-megawatt Belledune plant, which accounts
      for about 20 percent of the company’s carbon footprint.<br>
      <br>
      Hydrogen could also help NB Power to improve grid resilience,
      Kennedy said.<br>
      <br>
      By locating up to 30 hydrogen production stations ranging from 500
      kilowatts to 2 megawatts around the electricity network, the
      utility would be able to guard against blackouts caused by
      transmission line failures, he said.<br>
      <br>
      Finally, NB Power could act as an agent for the technology across
      North America. Thomas said taking out the license with Joi
      Scientific was “a calculated risk.”<br>
      <br>
      Faced with resorting to new hydro or nuclear to replace coal,
      “It’s a relatively modest investment compared to the options we
      have in our hands,” he said. “It could actually keep rates lower
      and create new revenue. There’s a lot of upside here.”<br>
      <br>
      NB Power is the second company to ink a license agreement with Joi
      Scientific. The first, announced last September, was with
      MarineMax, the world’s largest boat and yacht retailer, for
      on-board power systems.<br>

      <b>TECHNICAL FIELD</b><br>
      This disclosure relates to hydrogen generation systems and, more
      particularly, to hydrogen generation systems that use hydrolysis
      to generate hydrogen from feedstock.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND</b><br>
      Currently, the majority of the energy consumed by the developed
      world has its origins in fossil fuels. Unfortunately, there are
      many well-documented problems associated with over-reliance upon
      energy generated from fossil fuels, such as: pollution and climate
      change caused by the emission of greenhouse gases: the finite
      nature of fossil fuels and the dwindling reserves of such
      carbon-based energy sources; and the concentration of control of
      petroleum-based energy supplies by various volatile countries and
      OPEC.<br>
      <br>
      Accordingly, there is a need for alternative sources of energy.
      One such alternative energy source includes hydrogen generation
      systems that produce hydrogen via hydrolysis. Ideally, such
      hydrogen generation systems would be capable of producing hydrogen
      gas without the presence of oxygen, wherein such hydrogen may be
      used for industrial, commercial and residential purposes.<br>
      <br>
      For example, when greater than 99% pure, hydrogen may be used in
      generator cooling, steel production, glass production, and
      semiconductor and photovoltaic cell production. When less than 99%
      pure, hydrogen may be used in various industries, such as the
      aerospace industry, the animal feed industry, the automotive
      industry, the baking industry, the chemical industry, the ethanol
      industry, the food processing industry, the dairy industry, the
      meat industry, the manufacturing industry, the medical industry,
      the hospitality industry, the laundry/uniform industry, the marine
      and offshore industry, the military and defense industry, the
      mining industry, the oil and gas industry, the paper/corrugating
      industry, the pharmaceutical industry, the rubber industry, the
      steel and metals industry, the tobacco industry, the
      transportation industry, the wire and cable industry, and the
      education industry.<br>
      <br>
      Unfortunately, there are a number of significant hurdles that
      prevent the widespread use of hydrogen in commercial, industrial,
      and residential applications. These hurdles include cost,
      efficiency, and safety. First and foremost, creating hydrogen gas
      in a traditional manner is inefficient and costly, or even
      environmentally harmful when produced via reformation (i.e., the
      primary commercial method). Secondly, hydrogen's very low mass and
      energy density makes it challenging to get enough mass of hydrogen
      gas safely in one place to be of practical value to a user. The
      result is that hydrogen has been prohibitively expensive to
      produce, compress, cryogenically cool, maintain (at pressure and
      temperature), contain (due to its very small molecule structure),
      and transport. Accordingly, pressure, temperature, flammability,
      explosiveness, and low ignition energy requirement are all
      significant safety issues concerning the widespread use of
      hydrogen.<br>
      <br>
