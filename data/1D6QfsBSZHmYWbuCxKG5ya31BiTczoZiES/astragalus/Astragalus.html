      <br>
      Scientists claim they've harnessed the fountain of youth in a
      pill. But hang on to your hat - the price to turn back the clock
      might turn your hair grey.<br>
      <br>
      Bill Andrews is an avid runner who works hard to stay fit. So when
      he heard about the new anti-aging pill, he wanted in on the
      action. "I wasn't going to just sit back and watch it be studied.
      I want to get in it."<br>
      <br>
      The 55-year-old scientist understands how the pill works and hopes
      it's worth the cost.<br>
      <br>
      TA Sciences Founder Sciences Founder Noel Patton says, "The price
      is $25,000 for a one year protocol. That includes this product,
      other nutritional supplements and five series of medical exams." <br>
      <br>
      The product is TA-65 - a single, purified molecule extracted from
      a Chinese herb. <br>
      <br>
      "We have a molecule; it's the first in the history of the world
      that actually rejuvenates cells," says Patton. <br>
      <br>
      The makers of TA-65 claim it works by protecting cell chromosomes.
      <br>
      <br>
      Patton says, "Cells, every time they divide, the ends of the
      chromosomes called the telomeres get shorter." <br>
      <br>
      As they get shorter, the cell gets older and eventually dies. The
      process has been linked to aging. The owner of TA Sciences claims
      TA-65 activates an enzyme that restores the ends of chromosomes to
      reverse the cell's age. <br>
      <br>
      Patton says, "So if, for example, we made cells ten years younger,
      I'm not saying that we do, but if we made cells ten years younger,
      it would then take them ten years to get that old again." <br>
      <br>
      The manufacturer's trial of TA-65 shows positive anti-aging
      benefits. <br>
      <br>
      Dr. Jochem Kumm says, "There's a very tantalizing result here that
      shows that this product actually improves a number of functions
      and makes you more youthful." <br>
      <br>
      Time will tell if TA-65 truly is time in a bottle. An unpublished
      study suggests that TA-65 improves the immune system, skin
      condition, eyesight, and male sexual function. The pills are now
      available, but you'll have to travel to New York to get them and
      sign up for a year-long protocol...<br>

      Genus: &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Astragalus L.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      Astragalus is a large genus of about 3,000 species of herbs and
      small shrubs, belonging to the legume family Fabaceae and the
      subfamily Faboideae. It is the largest genus of plants in terms of
      described species.[1] The genus is native to temperate regions of
      the Northern Hemisphere. Common names include milkvetch (most
      species), locoweed (in North America, some species)[2] and
      goat's-thorn (A. gummifer, A. tragacanthus). Some pale-flowered
      vetches are similar in appearance, but vetches are more vine-like.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Ecology</b><br>
      <br>
      Astragalus species are used as food plants by the larvae of some
      Lepidoptera species including many case-bearing moths of the genus
      Coleophora: C. cartilaginella, C. colutella, C. euryaula, and C.
      onobrychiella feed exclusively on Astragalus, C. astragalella and
      C. gallipennella feed exclusively on the species Astragalus
      glycyphyllos, and C. hippodromica is limited to Astragalus gombo.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Traditional uses</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The natural gum tragacanth is made from several species of
      Astragalus occurring in the Middle East, including A. adscendens,
      A. gummifer, A. brachycalyx,[3][4] and A. tragacanthus. Also
      Astragalus propinquus (syn. A. membranaceus) has a history of use
      as a herbal medicine used in systems of traditional Chinese
      medicine[5] and Persian medicine. [6] In traditional Chinese
      medicine A. membranaceus has been used to reinforce qi and
      strengthen the superficial resistance, and promote the discharge
      of pus and the growth of new tissue.[7]<br>
      <br>
      <b>Research</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Biotechnology firms are working on deriving a telomerase activator
      from Astragalus. The chemical constituent cycloastragenol (also
      called TAT2) is being studied to help combat HIV, as well as
      infections associated with chronic diseases or aging.[8] However,
      the National Institutes of Health states: "The evidence for using
      astragalus for any health condition is limited. High-quality
      clinical trials (studies in people) are generally lacking. There
      is some preliminary evidence to suggest that astragalus, either
      alone or in combination with other herbs, may have potential
      benefits for the immune system, heart, and liver, and as an
      adjunctive therapy for cancer".[9]<br>
      <br>
      Research at the UCLA AIDS Institute focused on the function of
      cycloastragenol in the aging process of immune cells, and its
      effects on the cells' response to viral infections. It appears to
      increase the production of telomerase, an enzyme that mediates the
      replacement of short bits of DNA known as telomeres, which play a
      key role in cell replication, including in cancer processes.[10]<br>
      <br>
      <b>Supplement use</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Extracts of <b>Astragalus propinquus ( syn. A. membranaceus)</b>
      are marketed as life-prolonging extracts for human use. A
      proprietary extract of the dried root of A. membranaceus, called
      TA-65, "was associated with a significant age-reversal effect in
      the immune system, in that it led to declines in the percentage of
      senescent cytotoxic T cells and natural killer cells after six to
      twelve months of use".[11] There are mixed data regarding
      Astragalus, its effects on telomerase, and cancer. For example,
      although 80% of cancer cells utilize telomerase for their
      proliferation—a factor that might theoretically be exacerbated by
      Astragalus — the shortening of telomeres (resulting from such
      factors as stress and aging and possible contributors to
      malignancy), might also be mitigated by Astragalus. Thus, short
      telomeres result in chromosome instability, and the potential for
      telomere lengthening as a protection against cancer is
      possible.[12] Additionally, scientists recently reported that
      cancer cells may proliferate precisely because of the lack of
      differentiation occurring via damaged or shortened telomere
      length. They propose that "forced" elongation of telomeres
      promotes the differentiation of cancer cells, probably reducing
      malignancy, which is strongly associated with a loss of cell
      differentiation.<br>
      <b><br>
        Side effects and toxicology</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Astragalus may interact with medications that suppress the immune
      system, such as cyclophosphamide.[9] It may also affect blood
      sugar levels and blood pressure.[9] Some Astragalus species can be
      toxic. For example, several species native to North America
      contain the alkaloid swainsonine, which may cause "locoism" in
      livestock.[9] The toxicity of Astragalus taxa varies.[13]<br>

      Cycloastragenol is a molecule isolated from various species in the
      genus Astragalus that is purported to have telomerase activation
      activity. A single in vitro study done in 2009 led to claims that
      cycloastragenol may activate telomerase, leading to controversial
      claims for its role in reducing the effects of aging.[1]<br>
      <br>
      <b>History</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Cycloastragenol was studied by Geron Corporation and sold to T.A.
      Sciences in early 2013 who are developing it as a product named
      TA-65. Bill Andrews of Sierra Sciences has done testing on the
      anti-aging aspect of TA-65,[2][unreliable source?] however quality
      trials on the benefits of the product are lacking, and there are
      no high impact journal articles reviewing the efficacy of the
      TA65-MD, or indeed cyclostragenol.<br>
      <br>
      In late 2013, RevGenetics released their conclusions on TA-65 that
      showed it is the single molecule cycloastragenol used in
      TA-65.[3][unreliable source?] More recently, on May 15, 2014
      RevGenetics released a press release where they provide new
      information about a public UK government application where TA
      Sciences state (among other things) that the active ingredient in
      TA-65 is cycloastragenol.[4]<br>
      <br>
      <b>Potential pharmacology</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Its method of action is to activate the hTERT gene,[citation
      needed] thereby activating the enzyme telomerase.<br>
      <br>
      Cycloastragenol intake improved health span (not lifespan) in
      mice,[5] however the researchers did not investigate the extension
      of lifespan in the studied laboratory mice as this was not the
      focus of the project (it was associated aging diseases). Although
      the first TA Sciences study was done in 2005 for supplement based
      telomerase activators, in the 8 years since the first study, there
      has been no study done that shows a telomerase activator taken as
      a supplement has extended lifespan.<br>
      <br>
      As part of a study sponsored by RevGenetics, the cycloastragenol
      based product TA-65 was tested by UCLA scientist Rita B. Effros
      and RevGenetics[6] scientist Hector F. Valenzuela. The small study
      (6 participants) found that TA-65 activated telomerase in all
      samples of subjects tested, while another telomerase activator did
      not.[7] The clinical significance of this work is uncertain.<br>
      <br>
      Toxicity testing has shown it to be safe for human consumption.
      TA-65 was shown to improve biological markers associated with
      human health span through the lengthening of short telomeres and
      rescuing of old cells, although the significance of these findings
      in actual life expectancy is unknown.[8] Publications in
      high-impact peer-reviewed journals are lacking however, and much
      of the online documentation supporting its use is sponsored by its
      manufacturers.<br>
      <br>
      As disordered telomerase function is a feature of almost all
      cancers,[9] there is an unknown, but theoretical risk of
      oncogene-mediated cancer promotion through the use of telomerase
      activators.<br>

      </b><b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      All normal human somatic cells have a finite number of times that
      they can divide and when this limit is reached cells are described
      as cellular senescent. Telomere shortening has been attributed as
      a main mechanism for cellular aging and for the lack of cellular
      functions associated with aging. Unlike what is seen in most
      somatic cells, in activated T cells telomerase activity is
      upregulated, resulting in increased telomere length. However, this
      brief period of telomerase induction only delays cellular
      senescence. Naturally, there is a great deal of interest in
      finding inducers of telomerase that may help delay the onset of
      cellular aging. There are various nutraceuticals that claim to
      both increase the health of individuals and delay the onset of
      cellular aging. We tested the nutraceuticals resveratrol and
      cycloastragenol for their ability to enhance T cell functions in
      vitro. In this study we evaluated the effect of these compounds on
      cellular proliferative capacity, levels of telomerase activity,
      surface markers and cytokine secretion of human CD4 and CD8 T
      cells. Our results show that cycloastragenol moderately increase
      telomerase activity and proliferative capacity of both CD4 and CD8
      T cells. These preliminary results suggest that nutraceuticals
      inhibit the onset of CD4 and CD8 cellular senescence.<br>

      <b>Summary</b><br>
      <br>
      Here, we show that a small-molecule activator of telomerase
      (TA-65) purified from the root of Astragalus membranaceus is
      capable of increasing average telomere length and decreasing the
      percentage of critically short telomeres and of DNA damage in
      haploinsufficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) that harbor
      critically short telomeres and a single copy of the telomerase RNA
      Terc gene (G3 Terc+/- MEFs). Importantly, TA-65 does not cause
      telomere elongation or rescue DNA damage in similarly treated
      telomerase-deficient G3 Terc-/- littermate MEFs. These results
      indicate that TA-65 treatment results in telomerase-dependent
      elongation of short telomeres and rescue of associated DNA damage,
      thus demonstrating that TA-65 mechanism of action is through the
      telomerase pathway. In addition, we demonstrate that TA-65 is
      capable of increasing mouse telomerase reverse transcriptase
      levels in some mouse tissues and elongating critically short
      telomeres when supplemented as part of a standard diet in mice.
      Finally, TA-65 dietary supplementation in female mice leads to an
      improvement of certain health-span indicators including glucose
      tolerance, osteoporosis and skin fitness, without significantly
      increasing global cancer incidence.<br>

      <b>Abstract</b><br>
      <br>
      Most human cells lack sufficient telomerase to maintain telomeres,
      hence these genetic elements shorten with time and stress,
      contributing to aging and disease. In January, 2007, a commercial
      health maintenance program, PattonProtocol-1, was launched that
      included a natural product-derived telomerase activator (TA-65®,
      10–50 mg daily), a comprehensive dietary supplement pack, and
      physician counseling/laboratory tests at baseline and every 3–6
      months thereafter. We report here analysis of the first year of
      data focusing on the immune system. Low nanomolar levels of TA-65®
      moderately activated telomerase in human keratinocytes,
      fibroblasts, and immune cells in culture; similar plasma levels of
      TA-65® were achieved in pilot human pharmacokinetic studies with
      single 10- to 50-mg doses. The most striking in vivo effects were
      declines in the percent senescent cytotoxic (CD8+/CD28-) T cells
      (1.5, 4.4, 8.6, and 7.5% at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months, respectively;
      p = not significant [N.S.], 0.018, 0.0024, 0.0062) and natural
      killer cells at 6 and 12 months (p = 0.028 and 0.00013,
      respectively). Most of these decreases were seen in
      cytomegalovirus (CMV) seropositive subjects. In a subset of
      subjects, the distribution of telomere lengths in leukocytes at
      baseline and 12 months was measured. Although mean telomere length
      did not increase, there was a significant reduction in the percent
      short (&lt;4 kbp) telomeres (p = 0.037). No adverse events were
      attributed to PattonProtocol-1. We conclude that the protocol
      lengthens critically short telomeres and remodels the relative
      proportions of circulating leukocytes of CMV+ subjects toward the
      more “youthful” profile of CMV- subjects. Controlled randomized
      trials are planned to assess TA-65®-specific effects in humans.<br>

      <b>Introduction</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      People take dietary supplements with the intent to preserve
      mental, physical, and emotional health and vigor into old age.
      Although drugs and surgical procedures that target diseases of the
      elderly will hopefully arrest or partially reverse tissue damage
      caused by aging and chronic stress, measures to maintain health
      are arguably a better approach to lengthening our healthy life
      span. Most dietary supplement programs include combinations of
      vitamins, antioxidants, and other constituents, some of which have
      been shown to have significant health benefits in controlled
      clinical studies, whereas others may show adverse effects,1–6
      underscoring the need to assess functional effects of combination
      products. This paper presents initial data from an ongoing
      observational study of a novel dietary supplement program,
      PattonProtocol-1, which includes a natural product-derived
      telomerase activator targeting a fundamental aspect of cellular
      aging.<br>
      <br>
      Telomerase is an enzyme that synthesizes the specific DNA sequence
      at telomeres, i.e., the terminal DNA at the ends of all
      chromosomes.7,8 Telomeres are essential genetic elements
      responsible for protecting chromosome ends from being recognized
      as “broken DNA.” Because telomeric DNA cannot be fully replicated
      by conventional DNA polymerases, and because telomeres undergo
      degradative processing and are a “hotspot” for oxidative damage,9
      telomeres will gradually shorten with time and cell division
      unless there is sufficient telomerase activity to maintain
      telomere length.<br>
      <br>
      Telomerase is activated in fetal development, thus protecting
      telomeres from significant loss during this period of dramatic
      cell expansion.10,11 However, telomerase is repressed before birth
      in most somatic tissue, and, as a consequence, birth marks the
      beginning of telomere erosion in most tissues throughout life.
      Tissues with continual cell turnover or periods of rapid
      proliferation are “telomerase competent” in that they upregulate
      telomerase during early phases of progenitor expansion.12,13 All
      adult somatic stem cells appear to be capable of activating
      telomerase during tissue regeneration. However, these periods of
      activation are insufficient to prevent telomere loss, and this is
      compounded by a decreased ability to activate telomerase during
      aging and stress.14–16 In addition, stress can accelerate telomere
      loss by increasing cell turnover and the amount of telomeric DNA
      lost per cell division.17,18<br>
      <br>
      In cross-sectional studies, humans lose telomeric DNA at a very
      modest rate of about 15–60 bp per year, likely reflecting the
      small numbers of stem cells that are actively dividing in
      proliferative tissues compared to the total stem cell reserve, and
      the quiescent state of cells in other tissues. Telomere shortening
      has been investigated in human cells in culture, in human genetic
      diseases with mutated telomerase, and in animal models of
      telomerase deficiency.13,19–26 These studies point to a causal
      relationship between telomere loss, cell aging, reduced tissue
      regeneration, and loss of tissue structure and function. In
      support of this causal relationship, epidemiological studies show
      that short telomeres in humans are a risk factor for
      atherosclerosis, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, Alzheimer
      disease, infections, diabetes, fibrosis, metabolic syndrome,
      cancer, and overall mortality.18,24,25,27–30<br>
      <br>
      Chronic viral infections such as cytomegalovirus (CMV) and human
      immunodeficiency virus (HIV) accelerate telomere loss and
      premature aging of the immune system, especially the
      virus-specific cytotoxic T cells31–36 responsible for killing
      infected cells. In addition to telomere loss, these cells often
      lack expression of the co-stimulatory receptor CD28 and have
      reduced proliferative capacity, reduced ability to secrete
      antiviral cytokines and chemokines, increased resistance to
      apoptosis, and compromised ability to lyse infected cells. About
      50% of the U.S. population is infected with CMV as judged by
      circulating CMV-specific antibodies, but after an initial 30%
      seropositivity rate by age ˜10, there is ˜1% annual seroconversion
      rate throughout life leading to ˜90% seropositivity by the ninth
      decade. This linear increase has made it difficult to distinguish
      the effects of pure immunosenescence from those that can be
      attributed to this extremely common virus.37,38<br>
      <br>
      Here we report initial findings from a dietary supplement program
      which includes TA-65, a purified small-molecule telomerase
      activator derived from an extract of a plant commonly used in
      traditional Chinese medicine. Telomerase activation and functional
      studies on a related molecule (TAT2) from the same plant have been
      previously reported for human skin keratinocytes and immune cells
      in culture.36 Effects of TAT2 in tissue culture studies with CD8+
      T cells from HIV/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)
      subjects included increased replicative capacity, improved
      cytokine and chemokine responses to antigens, and increased
      killing of autologous HIV-infected CD4+ cells...<br>
      <br>
      <b>TA-65</b><br>
      <br>
      TA-65, exclusively licensed to TA Sciences from Geron Corporation,
      is a &gt;95% pure single chemical entity isolated from a
      proprietary extract of the dried root of Astragalus membranaceus
      and formulated into 5- to 10-mg capsules with inert excipients.
      Starting doses of 5–10 mg/day were considered safe on the basis of
      historical usage of extracts. Some subjects increased their dosage
      after several months on the product to 25–50 mg/day. Cumulative
      dose consumed during the year was recorded for each subject and
      used for preliminary dose–response analysis....<br>
      <br>
      TA-65® activated telomerase in cultured human cells at
      concentrations seen in the plasma of subjects on the protocol.
      Paradoxically, although ˜40% of subjects showed an increase in
      mean telomere length over time, on average across all subjects
      there was a nonsignificant decline in mean telomere length.
      However, we speculate this effect is explained by cell dynamics
      and the fact that telomerase preferentially lengths the shortest
      telomeres.62–64 Rescue and selective expansion of near-senescent
      cells with short telomeres could lead to a reduction in the
      population mean telomere length despite some lengthening of
      telomeres in all cells. Because detrimental effects of telomere
      loss are primarily driven by short, dysfunctional telomeres, and
      loss of tissue function and disease onset in proliferative tissues
      have been associated with telomere lengths &lt;4 kbp,25,65 we
      believe that our observed reduction in telomeres &lt;4 kbp in
      subjects on PattonProtocol-1 is a significant, positive response,
      and that TA-65® contributes to the apparent benefit of the dietary
      supplement. In support of this, studies with TA-65® given orally
      in old mice showed similar reductions in percent cells with short
      telomeres and positive functional effects on tissues (Blasco et
      al., submitted) and preliminary dose–response analyses showed an
      increase in salutary effects with TA-65® doses up to 20–30 mg per
      day average compared to the initial 5- to 10-mg per day dose (data
      not shown). Finally, analysis of additional biomarkers of aging in
      subjects on PattonProtocol-1 suggest improvements in the
      cardiovascular system, metabolism, and bone mineral density, which
      will be further studied and reported elsewhere. Independent
      randomized controlled studies with TA-65® alone are planned.<br>

      </div>
      <br>
      A dietary supplement based on blue green algae, phycocyanin and
      phenylethylamine is fortified with one or more of curcumin,
      silymarin, resveratrol, astragalus root extract, astragoloside IV,
      vitamin D3, vitamin C, anhydrous trimethylglycine and brewer's
      yeast to stimulate stem cell production and reduce the rate of
      telomere reduction or shortening. This can result in the repair of
      existing body cells and enhance longevity by stimulating the
      production of new stem cells and maintaining the telomeres on new
      stem cells as well as existing cells. The dietary supplement
      supports an increased life span by enhancing metabolic function,
      activating SIRT-1 anti-aging genes, and encouraging the production
      of new cells with longer telomeres.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Many attempts have been made to develop treatments and
      formulations to extend the human lifespan. To date, few, if any of
      these attempts have produced superior results, as few approaches
      fully recognize the basis or causes of aging. It is important to
      know the causes of aging, because as with treating a disease, one
      must first understand the problem, so that a precise remedy can be
      applied.<br>
      <br>
      Some of the current theories of aging may be a result of other
      older conventional theories. Many of these theories are
      interlinked, in the same complex way that biological processes of
      the body and the many factors affecting these processes are
      interlinked.<br>
      <br>
      Approaching any one or a combination of the following theories
      with a specialized treatment protocol may address and treat the
      aging problem on different levels, and help to slow down and
      eradicate some of the causes of aging. In order to appreciate the
      diversity of thought on the causes of aging, some of the current
      theories of aging are outlined below.<br>
      <br>
      <b>The DNA and Genetic Theories</b><br>
      <br>
      Some scientists regard the DNA and genetic theories as planned
      obsolescence theories because they focus on the encoded
      programming within DNA. DNA is the blueprint of individual life
      obtained from one's parents. Humans are born with a unique code
      and a predetermined tendency to certain types of physical and
      mental functioning that regulate the rate at which one ages.<br>
      <br>
      This type of genetic clock can be greatly influenced with regard
      to its rate of timing. For example, DNA is easily oxidized and
      this damage can be accumulated from diet, lifestyle, toxins,
      pollution, radiation and other outside influences. Thus, each
      individual has the ability to accelerate DNA damage or slow it
      down.<br>
      <br>
      One recent theory regarding gene damage is the telomerase theory
      of aging. A telomere is the repetitive DNA sequence located at the
      end of a chromosome which shortens progressively with each cell
      division and limits the replicative potential of normal human
      somatic cells. It is now understood that telomeres, the sequences
      of nucleic acids extending from the ends of chromosomes, shorten
      every time a cell divides. This shortening of telomeres is
      believed to lead to cellular damage due to the inability of the
      cell to duplicate itself correctly. Each time a cell divides it
      duplicates itself a little less accurately or worse than the time
      before. This eventually leads to cellular dysfunction, aging and
      death.<br>
      <br>
      Further research indicates that telomeres can be repaired by the
      introduction of a relevant hormone. Telomeres and their subsequent
      processes affect each other. Once we know what each telomere is
      responsible for, we may precisely introduce the necessary hormone
      and aid genetic repair, as well as hormonal balance.<br>
      <br>
      Another key element in rebuilding the disappearing telomeres is
      the enzyme telomerase, an enzyme so far only found in germ and
      cancer cells. Telomerase appears to repair and replace telomeres
      helping to re-regulate the clock that controls the lifespan of
      dividing cells.<br>
      <br>
      <b>The Neuroendocrine Theory</b><br>
      <br>
      This theory of aging elaborates on wear and tear by focusing on
      the neuroendocrine system. This system is a complicated network of
      biochemicals that govern the release of hormones which are altered
      by the walnut sized gland, the hypothalamus, located in the brain.<br>
      <br>
      <b>The Free Radical Theory</b><br>
      <br>
      The term free radical describes any molecule that has a free
      electron. This property makes the free radical molecule react with
      healthy molecules in a destructive way. Because the free radical
      molecule has an extra electron, it creates an extra negative
      charge. This unbalanced energy makes the free radical bind itself
      to another balanced molecule. In so doing, the balanced molecule
      becomes unbalanced and thus a free radical itself. It is known
      that diet, lifestyle, drugs (e.g. tobacco and alcohol) and
      radiation are all accelerators of free radical production within
      the body and can influence the rate of aging.<br>
      <br>
      <b>The Membrane Theory of Aging</b><br>
      <br>
      According to this theory, it is the age-related changes of the
      cells' ability to transfer chemicals, heat and electrical
      processes that impair the integrity of the cells.<br>
      <br>
      As one grows older the cell membrane becomes less lipid, less
      watery and more solid. This impedes its efficiency to conduct
      normal cell functions. In particular, this can lead to a toxic
      accumulation within the cell. This cellular toxin is referred to
      as lipofuscin and as one grows older lipofuscin deposits become
      more present in the brain, heart and lungs and also in the skin.
      Some of the skin age-pigments referred to as liver spots or age
      spots are composed of lipofuscin. It is known that Alzheimer
      disease patients have much higher levels of lipofuscin deposits
      than compared to their healthy control groups. The cells'
      declining efficiency also means that the essential and regular
      transfer of sodium and potassium is impaired, thus reducing
      cellular communication. It is also believed that electrical
      conduction and heat transfer is also impaired by this cellular
      degradation.<br>
      <br>
      <b>The Hayflick Limit Theory</b><br>
      <br>
      The Hayflick Limit Theory of aging suggests that the human cell is
      limited in the number of times it can divide. Part of this theory
      may be affected by cell waste accumulation (which is described in
      the Membrane Theory of aging). It is theorized that the human
      cell's ability to divide is limited to approximately 50 times,
      after which it simply stops dividing (and hence dies). It has been
      shown that nutrition has an effect on cells, with overfed cells
      dividing much faster than underfed cells. As cells divide to help
      repair and regenerate themselves the DNA &amp; Genetic Theory of
      Aging may play a role. Each time a cell divides it may lose some
      blue-print information. Eventually (after 50-odd times of
      division) there is simply not enough DNA information available to
      complete any sort of division.<br>
      <br>
      <b>The Mitochondrial Decline Theory</b><br>
      <br>
      The mitochondria are the power producing organelles found in every
      cell of every organ. Their primary job is to create adenosine
      triphosphate (ATP). They do so in the various energy cycles that
      involve nutrients such as acetyl-L-carnitine, CoQ10 (idebenone),
      NADH and some B vitamins. As the mitochondria decline, aging
      increases.<br>
      <br>
      <b>The Cross-Linking Theory</b><br>
      <br>
      The Cross-Linking Theory of aging is also referred to as the
      glycosylation theory of aging. In this theory, it is the binding
      of glucose (simple sugars) to protein, (a process that occurs
      under the presence of oxygen) that causes various aging problems.
      Once this binding has occurred, the protein becomes impaired and
      is unable to perform as efficiently. Living a longer life leads to
      the increased possibility of oxygen meeting glucose and binding
      glucose to protein. This can lead to cross-linking disorders
      including senile cataracts and the appearance of tough, leathery
      and yellow skin....<br>
