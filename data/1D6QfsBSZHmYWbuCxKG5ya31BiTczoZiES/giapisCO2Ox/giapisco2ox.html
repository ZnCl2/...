      <b>Abstract</b><br>
      The intramolecular conversion of CO2 to molecular oxygen is an
      exotic reaction, rarely observed even with extreme optical or
      electronic excitation means. Here we show that this reaction
      occurs readily when CO2 ions scatter from solid surfaces in a
      two-step sequential collision process at hyperthermal incidence
      energies. The produced O2 is preferentially ionized by charge
      transfer from the surface over the predominant atomic oxygen
      product, leading to direct detection of both O2+ and O2-.
      First-principles simulations of the collisional dynamics reveal
      that O2 production proceeds via strongly-bent CO2 configurations,
      without visiting other intermediates. Bent CO2 provides dynamic
      access to the symmetric dissociation of CO2 to C+O2 with a
      calculated yield of 1 to 2% depending on molecular orientation.
      This unexpected collision-induced transformation of individual CO2
      molecules provides an accessible pathway for generating O2 in
      astrophysical environments and may inspire plasma-driven electro-
      and photo-catalytic strategies for terrestrial CO2 reduction.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Introduction</b><br>
      Although plentiful in modern Earth’s atmosphere, molecular oxygen
      is extremely rare in space. Only trace amounts have been found
      elsewhere in our solar system1,2,3 and in interstellar clouds4,5.
      The recent discovery of abundant O2 in the coma of comet 67P/CG6
      has rekindled interest in abiotic reactions, occurring in extreme
      environments, which release O2 from compounds, such as H2O, CO2,
      CO, silicates, and metal oxides. Such reactions may offer
      competing explanations for the origin of O2 in comets, in the
      upper atmosphere of Mars, and in Earth’s prebiotic
      atmosphere7,8,9. They may also present alternative ways for
      resource utilization related to space travel, such as generation
      of O2 from CO2 for making Mars habitable. Finally, new strategies
      for CO2 activation may be inspired by such reactions.<br>
      <br>
      The dissociation of CO2 proceeds via multiple pathways depending
      on available energy. The partial dissociation reaction,
      CO2???CO?+?O (3P or 1D), has the lowest energy requirement (5.43
      or 7.56?eV)10; it has been extensively studied in photochemistry
      and in heterogeneous catalysis under thermal activation
      conditions11,12. Full dissociation to C?+?O?+?O involves the
      cleavage of both C–O bonds and requires 16.46?eV. Other pathways
      may be possible at intermediate energies, such as the exotic
      reaction: CO2???C(3P)?+?O2(1Sg), which entails extensive
      intramolecular rearrangement of the CO2 molecule. Calculations
      have suggested that this reaction proceeds on the ground-state
      potential energy surface, by first forming a cyclic CO2
      intermediate [c-CO2(1A1)], which then rearranges into a collinear
      COO(1S+) intermediate on its way to dissociation into C?+?O210.
      The first step in this channel involves bending of the CO2
      molecule to bring the two O atoms in close proximity, which
      requires close to 6?eV of internal energy13.<br>
      <br>
      Although inaccessible by thermal activation, transitions to
      electronically excited and anionic states of CO2 can bend the
      molecule as a first step to O2 production. Indeed, pioneering
      experiments employing VUV photo-excitation14,15,16 and electron
      attachment17,18 have shown that dissociation of CO2 into
      C(3P)?+?O2(X3Sg-) is possible, as evidenced by the detection of
      the complementary atomic C+ or C- fragment. Further confirmation
      of the exotic pathway, however, remained elusive as neutral or
      ionized O2 products were not detected. Using ion-beam scattering
      methods and numerical simulation techniques, we demonstrate here a
      different way to drive the direct reduction of CO2 to O2 with in
      situ detection of ionized O2 products. The process involves a
      previously unknown intramolecular reaction pathway, which occurs
      in energetic CO2 ion–surface collisions with a surprising lack of
      dependence on either the nature of the surface or the surface
      temperature. As such, the reaction may be relevant for
      astrophysical environments, such as comets, moons, and planets
      with CO2 atmospheres.<br>

      We first demonstrate the formation of O2 in hyperthermal CO2+/Au
      collisions by plotting kinetic energy distributions of three
      scattered molecular ion products: CO2+, O2+, and O2- for various
      CO2+ incidence energies (E0). Very weak signal of scattered CO2+
      is detected for E0?&lt;?80?eV (Fig. 1a). The CO2+ exit energy peak
      varies in proportion to E0, thus implying a ballistic or impulsive
      rebound from the surface and thereby precluding physical
      sputtering as its origin. Observation of this “dynamic” CO2+
      signal is important, not only for proving that some CO2 survives
      the surface encounter but also for unraveling the collision
      sequence of the constituent atoms. Strong signal of scattered O2
      ions is also observed (Fig.1b, c). The O2+ and O2- exit energies
      represent a large fraction of the incidence energy (57%) and
      increase monotonically with E0 over a larger range than scattered
      CO2+. The O2 ion signal intensity exhibits a maximum at
      E0?~?100?eV. Above that, only the O2+ distribution develops a
      shoulder (i.e., exit at ~30?eV) from physical sputtering.<br>
      <br>
      The detection of fast O2 ion products is surprising. Neither
      sputtering of surface O2 nor O-atom abstraction reactions
      (Eley–Rideal) can explain their formation, because both mechanisms
      would produce O2 at much lower exit energies (see the section
      “Methods”). A remaining possibility to be explored here is dynamic
      formation of O2 through dissociation of CO2. Dynamic partial and
      full dissociation of CO2 is in fact consistent with the other
      detected products, including CO+, CO-, O+, O-, and C+
      (Supplementary Fig. 1). The exit energy of the CO+, CO-, and O-
      fragments varies linearly with incidence energy, consistent with
      dynamic formation during the surface collision. In contrast, the
      O+ and C+ peaks show little dependence on E0, suggesting a
      different origin, i.e., sputtering19. Scattered C+ products appear
      at E0?&gt;?80?eV, confirming full dissociation.<br>
      <br>
      The presence of dynamically exiting CO2+ ions enables use of
      kinematics20 to clarify the scattering mechanism. Binary collision
      theory (BCT) allows calculation of the kinematic factor, defined
      as the fraction of incident energy retained by a scattered product
      exiting the surface. In the simplest possible model, CO2+ scatters
      as a whole molecule, i.e., a hard sphere with atomic mass of
      44?Da. Under this assumption, BCT predicts a kinematic factor of
      0.6349, which fits the data poorly (Fig. 2a) as may be expected
      given the quasi-linear nature of the triatomic CO2+ ion21,22. We
      consider next a kinematic model in which—as for diatomic molecules
      scattering on metal surfaces23—the leading O atom first collides
      with a surface Au atom, followed by a second collision of the CO
      moiety without prompt dissociation of the CO2 molecule. Applying
      BCT to this sequential-collision model yields a kinematic factor
      of 0.7870, which agrees very well with the CO2+ exit energy data
      (Fig. 2a, black line).<br>
      <br>
      The average exit energies for all remaining scattered products are
      also plotted in Fig. 2a. Potential origins for such species
      include partial or full dissociation of CO2 and surface sputtering
      of adsorbed CO2 fragments. While some sputtering is indeed
      observed at high E0 (&gt;140?eV), kinematic analysis of the exit
      energy data provides strong evidence for impulsive dissociation of
      the CO2 molecule24. Assuming delayed fragmentation of the CO2
      parent24, the kinematic factors of the CO, O, and (possibly) O2
      daughter products can be calculated from energy conservation to be
      0.5724, 0.5008, and 0.2862, respectively. These factors are used
      as fixed slopes in one-parameter fittings of the respective data
      points (adjustable intercept). We find that the calculated slopes
      fit the O2±, CO±, and O- ion exit data very well (Fig. 2a lines),
      indicating that the latter ions are all dissociation products of
      CO2. On the contrary, the O+ and C+ data are not linear with
      respect to E0, suggesting formation by other processes.<br>
      <br>
      Velocity analysis for the observed scattered species provides
      further evidence regarding the collision mechanism. Figure 2b
      compares the ion distributions of various peaks for E0?=?56.4?eV.
      The exit velocities of scattered CO+, O2+, O2-, and the slower
      part of the O- distributions overlap, suggesting a common origin.
      However, the O- distribution is noticeably broader, extending to
      higher exit velocities, which suggests alternative formation
      channels. The O2 ion products exit with velocities lower than CO2+
      owing to inelasticity from breaking of chemical bonds and
      non-resonant surface ionization.<br>
      <br>
      Although the kinematic analysis indicates conclusively that some
      CO2 scatters intact after a two-step sequential collision of the O
      and CO moieties, it leaves various aspects of the O2 formation
      mechanism unresolved. In particular, since the experiment is
      limited to observing ions, we are unable to assess how much
      neutral O2 is produced. Moreover, the kinematic analysis cannot
      shed light on whether O2 is formed via an electronically adiabatic
      or non-adiabatic mechanism, nor can it disentangle the
      collision-induced pathways that underlie the exit velocity
      distributions of the ionic fragments. To address these questions,
      we next turn to first-principles molecular dynamics (MD)
      simulations.<br>
      MD simulations of carbon dioxide collisions with gold<br>
      <br>
      MD trajectories for the scattering of CO2 on Au(111) are performed
      in the experimental scattering geometry, with CO2 evolving on the
      ground singlet potential energy surface under the assumption that
      incoming CO2+ ions are neutralized before the hard collision.
      Facile neutralization occurs via resonant electron
      tunneling24,25,26 from the metal surface to the molecular cation
      because the molecular level of CO2 (-13.8?eV) lies well within the
      occupied band of Au (-5.3 to -15.3?eV). Electron transfer from and
      to the surface is explicitly included in the simulations to also
      account for ionization of neutral collision products. The
      calculated exit energies of the products are plotted in Fig. 2c
      along with linear two-parameter fits. The slopes obtained from
      this fitting procedure compare very well to those determined from
      BCT (Fig. 2a). For example, the exiting CO2+ has a calculated
      slope of 0.713 vs. the experimental value of 0.787. Negligible CO2
      is found to survive for E0?&gt;?80?eV, consistent with the lack of
      experimental signal at these energies. All other calculated slopes
      agree well with the experimental values; for instance, compare the
      slope of 0.54?±?0.02 vs. the experimental value of 0.57 for the
      O2- line. These results indicate broad agreement between the
      simulations and the scattering kinematics.<br>
      <br>
      The formation of ions detected in the experiment requires surface
      ionization, which influences the yields of the ionic products. The
      MD simulations demonstrate a substantial enrichment of O2- ions
      over O-, resulting from the exponential dependence of the
      ionization probability on the coupling to the metal surface
      (Supplementary Fig. 2, red curve), which can reach ~30%,
      comparable to the experimentally derived yield of 33%
      (Supplementary Fig. 2, blue curve).<br>
      <br>
      The agreement between experiment and simulations is further
      demonstrated by comparing the ion exit velocity distributions at
      E0?=?56.4?eV (Fig. 2d). Although the experimental peak positions
      appear systematically at somewhat larger velocities than the
      calculated ones, the distributions agree very well with respect to
      relative position of the peaks. In particular, both simulations
      and experiment find the CO+ and O- velocity distributions to be
      broadened, both find the O2+ and O2- distributions to be similar
      with the cation exiting slower than the anion, and both find CO2+
      to exit with higher velocity than the ionized O2 products. The
      agreement suggests that the simulations provide a strong
      foundation for analyzing the reaction mechanism of the direct CO2
      conversion to O2.<br>
      <br>
      An ensemble of 20,000 CO2-on-Au collision trajectories were
      performed for each incidence energy, resulting in a variety of
      dissociation products, including O2 (Fig. 3a). Prior to the
      mechanistic ensemble analysis, it is instructive to review one
      representative trajectory that leads to collisional O2 formation
      (Fig. 3b). Select configurations are shown as insets, along with
      the CO2–Au interaction energy, ECO2<br>
      –Au, and the CO2 internal energy, ECO2, as a function of time. The
      incoming CO2 molecule is vibrationally excited (inset I). As the
      center-of-mass distance to the surface, ZCO2, decreases, the
      molecule penetrates the repulsive potential wall of the surface
      and ECO2–Au increases steeply. During this encounter, one of the O
      atoms of CO2 strikes a surface Au atom, giving rise to the first
      peak in the ECO2–Au curve (inset II). This collision occurs before
      ZCO2 reaches a minimum at the apsis point. As the O atom rebounds,
      the CO moiety collides with a different Au atom, causing a second
      peak in the ECO2–Au curve (inset III), which occurs after the
      apsis. As a result of the impulsive energy transfer during the
      collision, the rebounding CO2 undergoes substantial intramolecular
      rearrangement portrayed by the bond distance evolution in Fig. 3b.
      The O–O distance, rO2, decreases while the C–O distances, rCO,
      simultaneously increase, reaching a point along the trajectory
      where CO2 acquires a triangular configuration with nearly equal
      bond lengths (vertical dashed line). This strongly bent CO2
      intermediate (inset IV) has a significant amount of internal
      energy, ECO2, and promptly dissociates to give a free C atom and a
      vibrationally hot O2 molecule (inset V). The complete CO2
      collision trajectory discussed in Fig. 3b can be viewed in the
      Supplementary Video. The formation of O2 depicted by this
      representative trajectory proceeds by delayed fragmentation
      following the two-step sequential collision of CO2 with the
      surface. This mechanism is consistent with the assumptions of the
      kinematic model used earlier to explain the experimental data in
      Fig. 2a, b.<br>
      **<br>
      The calculated reaction yields of the various collision-induced
      dissociation channels of CO2 at E0?=?56.4?eV are shown in Fig. 3a.
      As expected for this low incidence energy, the partial
      dissociation channel dominates the reaction yield with 73% of all
      MD trajectories taking that pathway. The complete dissociation
      channel is second at 16%. A small fraction of the incoming CO2
      (6%) survives the collision in correspondence with experimental
      detection. Approximately 5% of all trajectories lead to the
      strongly bent intermediate state—the precursor to O2
      formation—which is characterized by C–O and O–O bond orders
      exceeding 0.7. This intermediate state fragments primarily via
      partial dissociation (51%) followed again by complete
      dissociation, albeit now with a higher yield (33%). Remarkably,
      one in eight (13%) of the strongly bent CO2 molecules produces O2.
      The overall neutral yield of the symmetric dissociation channel,
      CO2???C?+?O2, amounts to 0.6% at E0?=?56.4?eV. Upon increasing
      incidence energy, the neutral O2 yield obtained from the ensemble
      of isotropically oriented incident CO2 molecules reaches
      0.8?±?0.2% for E0?~?70?±?15?eV (Fig. 4, blue line). Also it is
      clear from the figure that the fraction of O2-producing
      trajectories increases substantially once the strongly bent CO2
      intermediate state is reached (Fig. 4, green line) and this
      fraction peaks at around 13% for E0?~?55?±?10?eV. The smaller
      total neutral O2 yield results from the small fraction of linear
      CO2 molecules reaching the strongly bent state (Fig. 4, red line).
      By preferentially orienting incoming CO2 molecules (axis parallel
      to the surface), the fraction of O2-producing trajectories
      increases to ~2% (Fig. 4, dashed blue line) resulting from an
      increase of the dissociation probability of the strongly bent
      state to O2 (Fig. 4, dashed green line). These findings suggest
      that activation of bending and symmetric stretching motion of CO2
      prior to the collision may facilitate both the population of the
      strongly bent state and its dissociation to O2 leading to a
      significant increase in the total neutral O2 yield.<br>
      **figure4<br>
      <br>
      The timescales for bond breaking and formation in the
      collision-induced dissociation reactions were evaluated for
      E0?=?56.4?eV and are reported in the inset of Fig. 3a. The average
      delay times reveal that both partial dissociation and the first
      C–O bond-breaking event in complete dissociation occur promptly
      after the apsis. In contrast, the formation of the strongly bent
      CO2 intermediate state and its fragmentation to O2 occur on a
      longer timescale, to allow for the significant intramolecular
      rearrangement that precedes symmetric dissociation. This is again
      consistent with the assumption of delayed fragmentation used in
      the kinematic modeling. The second C–O bond breaking in the
      complete dissociation channel is also delayed, irrespective of the
      degree of bending of CO2. The different timescales of the
      collisional reactions explain the widths of the observed exit
      velocity distributions. For instance, O atoms produced in prompt
      partial and delayed complete dissociation, have different velocity
      profiles, giving rise to a considerably broader O- velocity
      distribution (Fig. 2d). In particular, prompt partial dissociation
      involves direct scattering of O atoms from the much heavier Au
      target, producing faster O-atom exits owing to inefficient
      momentum transfer. On the other hand, the second C–O bond breaking
      involves dissociation of the more massive, recoiling CO moiety of
      CO2, which gives off slower O atoms (Supplementary Fig. 3).
      Moreover, the narrow velocity profiles of the molecular O2 ions
      stem from CO2 scattering as a whole molecule, which breaks apart
      unimolecularly during the rebound from the surface.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Discussion</b><br>
      The convergent analysis and agreement among experiment,
      kinematics, and first-principles MD simulations presented in this
      work support a collision-induced mechanism for direct
      intramolecular conversion of CO2 to O2. Specifically, with the
      dynamics evolving on the ground electronic state of neutral CO2,
      we find that O2 is formed via delayed fragmentation, where the
      delay results from atomic rearrangement of the colliding CO2
      molecules into a strongly bent geometry. This geometry provides
      access to the O2 dissociation product, without visiting other
      intermediates. Alternative mechanisms were also theoretically
      investigated, including the possibility of a collision-induced,
      non-adiabatic transition of the neutral CO2 molecules to
      electronically excited states (Supplementary Fig. 4), as well as
      collisional dissociation on the anionic CO2- surface following
      double electron transfer from the Au surface. Although these more
      complicated processes offer intriguing and potentially exploitable
      alternative avenues to O2 formation, they were not necessary for
      explaining the experimental observables and were calculated to be
      less likely under the current experimental conditions.<br>
      <br>
      The mechanism reported here is distinct from previously proposed
      mechanisms for CO2???C?+?O2 conversion. Specifically, the
      mechanism differs from that of photochemical interconversion14 not
      only in terms of activation (collisional vs. photochemical) but
      also because the collisional mechanism occurs via a delayed
      fragmentation of a single CO2 intermediate, i.e., without visiting
      the linear COO state. The collisional mechanism also differs
      fundamentally from that taking place in electron-attachment
      experiments17, where the CO2 bends spontaneously on the anionic
      potential energy surface. Instead, the bent CO2 state is accessed
      on the neutral surface via collisional energy transfer.
      Furthermore, while the collisional interconversion of CO2 to O2
      has comparable efficiency to activation via high-energy photons
      and higher efficiency than via electron attachment, it is a much
      simpler process. Importantly, our mechanism is independent of
      surface temperature and generic to surface composition (tested on
      Au, Pt, SiO2, In2O3, SnO2) as long as: (i) the surface contains
      atoms heavier than the constituents of CO2 and (ii) surface
      charging is mitigated when CO2 ions are used. Finally, we note
      that an analogous dissociation reaction: OCS???C?+?SO, previously
      reported27 for OCS+ collisions on Ag(111), was speculated to occur
      via a sharply bent excited state, such as the OCS(3A), activated
      either by neutralization prior to impact or by the energetic
      collision with the surface. However, the basic mechanistic
      features of the latter process—including whether it involves
      unimolecular collisions or Eley–Rideal reactions with
      surfaced-absorbed O or S atoms—were not addressed.<br>
      <br>
      The intramolecular CO2 reaction may be relevant in astrochemical
      environments with abundant CO2 and prevalent solar wind. Solar
      ultraviolet light photo-ionizes CO2 molecules readily, producing
      ions which are then picked up by the solar wind and accelerated to
      hyperthermal energies28,29. Collisions of these fast ions with the
      surfaces of dust particles or other astrophysical bodies can
      activate the dissociation. Such interactions may affect
      dynamically the composition of cometary comae, contributing to the
      abundance of the super-volatiles O2 and CO. Production of O2 from
      CO2 was explicitly disregarded in the coma of comet 67P early on
      (pre-perihelion) during the Rosetta mission, owing to the low
      abundance of CO2 and poor correlation between O2 and CO2 fluxes6.
      However, the situation may warrant reexamination in the
      post-perihelion phase, when CO2 can reach abundancies as high as
      32% relative to H2O, a 10-fold increase versus pre-perihelion30.
      The precise level of contribution to the O2 abundance in the coma
      cannot be determined without CO2 ion energy and flux data.
      Nevertheless, the number is likely small for collisional
      encounters on dust and cometary surfaces. Even at low yield,
      however, contribution to the measured O2 abundance may be
      disproportionate if the CO2 reaction occurs close to the point of
      measurement. For example, we have verified experimentally that the
      reaction takes place on indium–tin oxide (ITO), a man-made
      material found on Rosetta’s thermal insulation and solar panels.
      Thus, CO2 collisions on the spacecraft’s exposed surfaces can
      change the composition of the surrounding gaseous halo with
      unknown repercussions for mass spectrometric measurements31.<br>
      <br>
      Similar collisional processes may have occurred in early Earth
      when projectiles, such as meteorites, traversed through its
      CO2-dominated atmosphere; likewise, orbiting satellites/spacecraft
      or high-speed space debris32 will encounter neutral or
      photoionized CO2 in Mars’ upper ionosphere. In these situations,
      the target surface is moving against a stagnant CO2 atmosphere
      with correspondingly high velocities, driving the partial
      transformation of CO2 into O2. Indeed, O2 abundances in the 1000’s
      of parts per million measured at Mars33 may contain significant
      contributions from such processes.<br>
      <br>
      Finally, although the yield of O2 is relatively small in the
      current study, a combination of collisional activation with
      photoexcitation, electron attachment, and Eley–Rideal reactions in
      a plasma reactor may result in a process that could be promising
      for CO2 reduction strategies, as well as plasma-driven continuous
      O2 production in CO2 atmospheres.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Methods</b><b><br>
      </b><b>Experimental</b><br>
      All experiments were carried out in a custom-made low-energy ion
      scattering apparatus34. The CO2+ ion beam was extracted from an
      inductively coupled plasma, struck in a reactor held at 2?mTorr
      using a CO2/Ar/Ne gas mixture supplied with 500?W RF power at
      13.56?MHz. Ions were delivered to a grounded surface at 45°
      incidence angle; typical beam currents of 5–15?µA were spread over
      a ~3?mm spot. Beam energy was varied between 40 and 200?eV by
      externally adjusting the plasma potential. The beam energy
      distribution had a Gaussian shape with a FWHM of ~5?eV. Typical
      target surfaces were polycrystalline Au foils (5?N),
      sputter-cleaned with an Ar+ ion gun before each run. Scattered ion
      products, exiting at an angle of 45° in the scattering plane, were
      energy-resolved and mass-resolved using an electrostatic ion
      energy analyzer and a quadruple mass spectrometer, respectively.
      All ions were detected using a channel electron multiplier, biased
      as appropriate to detect positive or negative ions. Differences in
      detector bias precluded a direct comparison of signal intensities
      between product ions of different charge polarities. All collected
      signals were normalized to the beam current measured on the
      sample...<br>

      [0001] The application claims priority to U.S. Provisional
      Application No. 62/463,021, filed Feb. 24, 2017, entitled “Method
      for Splitting Carbon Dioxide into Molecule Oxygen and Carbon,” the

      <b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0002] Apparatus and methods for producing molecular oxygen (or
      its relevant analogs, e.g., O2&lt;+&gt; and O2&lt;- &gt;ions)
      directly from CO2 molecules are provided.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0003] Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a symmetric linear triatomic
      molecule, wherein carbon atom is covalently bound to two oxygen
      atoms via strong double bonds. Trace amounts of CO2, a colorless
      gas, occur naturally in the Earth's atmosphere, wherein its
      current concentration is ~0.04% (405 ppm) by volume, having risen
      from pre-industrial levels of 280 ppm. However, despite a
      seemingly low concentration, CO2 gas is the main contributor to
      the atmospheric greenhouse effect, and, therefore, is of major
      concern to humanity, especially in view of the alarmingly rapid
      increases of its atmospheric concentration in recent decades.
      Consequently, various technologies for CO2 sequestration from the
      Earth's atmosphere are currently being investigated and pursued,
      although no definitive solution has been found to date.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] In contrast, dioxygen gas (O2) is the basis of life on
      Earth and is rather abundant in the atmosphere. However, an
      oxygen-rich atmosphere is quite unique to Earth, because, although
      elemental oxygen is the third most abundant element in the
      universe, its molecular dioxygen form is very rare. Specifically,
      in contrast to Earth, where oxygenic photosynthesis has made O2
      abundant, interstellar and cometary oxygen atoms are chemically
      bound to other elements in compounds such as H2O, CO2, CO,
      silicates, and metal oxides, making the release of O2 from these
      reservoirs difficult and energetically very expensive. As such,
      only tenuous amounts of dioxygen are found elsewhere in our solar
      system, e.g., in the moons of Jupiter and Saturn and on Mars; in
      fact, the abundance of molecular oxygen has been suggested as a
      promising biomarker. Accordingly, efficient generation of O2 from
      CO2 is particularly desirable for space travel to Mars, Venus, and
      other planetary bodies with CO2-rich atmospheres.<br>

      <b>DETAILED DISCLOSURE</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0042] Turning to the drawings and data, methods and apparatus for
      the facile conversion of CO2 to molecular oxygen are provided. It
      will be understood that the embodiments of the invention described
      herein are not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention
      to precise forms disclosed. Rather, the embodiments selected for
      description have been chosen to enable one skilled in the art to
      practice the invention.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] Despite the pressing demand for effective removal of CO2
      from the atmosphere and apparent benefits of converting CO2
      specifically into O2, only one abiotic pathway to O2 was known
      until recently, namely, the three-body recombination reaction,
      O+O+M?O2+M, where the requisite atomic oxygen arises from CO2
      photo-dissociation and M is a third body (Kasting, J. F., Liu, S.
      C., Donahue, T. M. Oxygen levels in the prebiological atmosphere.
      J. Geophys. Res. 84, 3097-3107 (1979); and Segura, A., Measows, V.
      S., Kasting, J. F., Crisp, D., Cohen, M. Abiotic formation of O2
      and O3 in high-CO2 terrestrial atmospheres. Astron. Astrophys.
      472, 665-679 (2007); the disclosures of which are incorporated
      herein by reference). This finding was superseded by the discovery
      of two new pathways for direct O2 formation from CO2: one via
      vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) photo-dissociation (as described in Lu,
      Z., Chang, Y. C., Yin, Q. Z., Ng, C. Y. &amp; Jackson, W. M.
      Evidence for direct molecular oxygen production in CO2
      photodissociation. Science 346, 61-64 (2014), the disclosure of
      which is incorporated herein by reference) and one via
      dissociative electron attachment (DEA) (as described in Wang, X.
      D., Gao, X. F., Xuan, C. J. &amp; Tian, S. X. Dissociative
      electron attachment to CO2 produces molecular oxygen. Nature Chem.
      8, 258-263 (2016), the disclosure of which is incorporated herein
      by reference). In both of these latter studies, direct detection
      of the neutral O2 photoproduct was not possible because of
      background interference. Instead, experimental evidence for the
      dissociation reaction of a highly-excited CO2 electronic state
      (Suits, A. G. &amp; Parker, D. H. Hot molecules-off the batten
      path. Science 346, 30 (2014), the disclosure of which is
      incorporated herein by reference) into the
      C(&lt;3&gt;P)+O2(X&lt;3&gt;Sg&lt;-&gt;) products was based on
      detecting the complementary atomic C&lt;+&gt; or C&lt;-
      &gt;fragment. In addition, O2&lt;+&gt; ions from the
      photo-dissociation of CO2 were recently detected using strong
      laser fields to photo-produce the doubly-ionized CO2&lt;++&gt;
      state, which dissociates into C&lt;+&gt;+O2&lt;+&gt;, altogether a
      very inefficient process (Larimian, S. et al. Molecular oxygen
      observed by direct photoproduction from carbon dioxide. Phys. Rev.
      A 95, 011404 (2017), the disclosure of which is incorporated
      herein by reference). Direct production of O2&lt;- &gt;from
      dissociative attachment in CO2 has collision cross sections so
      small ( ~10&lt;-24 &gt;cm&lt;2&gt;) that “signal must be
      accumulated over several days” to observe it even with extremely
      sensitive detection systems (Spence, D. &amp; Schulz, G. J. Cross
      sections for production of O2&lt;- &gt;and C by dissociative
      electron attachment in CO2: an observation of the Renner-Teller
      effect. J. Chem. Phys. 60, 216-220 (1974), the disclosure of which
      is incorporated herein by reference). Therefore, new methods for
      the efficient splitting of CO2 to produce O2 are highly desirable
      and sought after in areas ranging from atmospheric science to
      space travel.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] Direct conversion of CO2 into molecular oxygen is an
      energetically very unfavorable reaction. In principle, direct
      dissociation of CO2 can proceed along three pathways (shown below
      with the indicated dissociation energies):<br>
      <br>
      CO2?CO+O (5.5 eV)&nbsp; (I)<br>
      <br>
      CO2?C+O2 (5.8 eV)&nbsp; (II)<br>
      <br>
      CO2?C+2O (11.0 eV)&nbsp; (III)<br>
      <br>
      Channel (I) describes the primary partial dissociation reaction,
      which has been widely studied in photochemistry and in
      heterogeneous catalysis under thermal activation conditions (as
      detailed, for example, in: Rosen, B. A. et al. Ionic
      liquid-mediated selective conversion of CO2 to CO at low
      overpotentials. Science 334, 643-644 (2011); and Liu, M. et al.
      Enhanced electrocatalytic CO2 reduction via field-induced reagent
      concentration. Nature 537, 382-386 (2016), the disclosures of
      which are incorporated herein by reference). Channel (III)
      represents the energetically expensive complete dissociation of
      CO2 with cleavage of both C—O bonds. In contrast, channel (II) is
      an exotic pathway, which requires extensive intramolecular bond
      rearrangement within the triatomic CO2, despite the fact that its
      dissociation energy is only 0.3 eV larger than that of channel
      (I). However, simulations have shown a possible way to realize
      channel (II) by first forming the cyclic CO2 complex
      [c-CO2(&lt;1&gt;A1)], which then must transform into the collinear
      COO(&lt;1&gt;S&lt;+&gt;) intermediate on its way to dissociation
      into C+O2. The first step in this scheme requires bending of the
      linear CO2 molecule in order to bring the two O atoms in close
      proximity. Although inaccessible by thermal activation, the
      barrier to bending may be, in theory, overcome by other means of
      excitation, such as VUV photon irradiation or energetic electron
      bombardment.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] It has now been discovered that, as described in the
      embodiments of this invention, channel (II) can also be activated
      by energetic collisions of CO2 molecules (or, in some embodiments,
      of their CO2&lt;+&gt; ion analogs) with solid surfaces. In many
      such embodiments, when CO2&lt;+&gt; ions are collided with a solid
      surface, O2 molecules and O2&lt;±&gt; ions evolve directly from a
      scattered excited state (CO2*) undergoing late fragmentation.
      Accordingly, this application is directed to embodiments of an
      unexpected and surprisingly efficient method for facilitating an
      intramolecular reaction that occurs in single collisions of CO2
      molecules (or their derivatives amenable to controllable
      acceleration, such as CO2&lt;+&gt; ions) with a solid surface,
      such that molecular oxygen (or its relevant analogs, e.g.,
      O2&lt;+&gt; and O2&lt;- &gt;ions) is directly produced. In many
      embodiments of the invention, the reaction is driven by momentum
      of the CO2 molecule or ion accelerated against a surface and
      incoming at an incident angle and will occur irrespective of the
      surface composition and temperature. However, in many embodiments,
      the yield of O2 production from CO2 splitting does depend on
      surface composition in so far as surfaces that would be reactive
      with CO2 or its fragmentation products can poison the reaction. In
      some embodiments, the method may be used to remove CO2 from
      Earth's atmosphere, while, in other embodiments, the method may be
      used to prevent the atmosphere's contamination with CO2 emissions.
      In yet other embodiments, the method may be used to obtain
      molecular oxygen in CO2-rich environments, such as to facilitate
      exploration of extraterrestrial bodies with CO2-rich atmospheres
      (e.g. Mars).<br>
      <br>
      [0046] In many embodiments, the method for splitting carbon
      dioxide into molecular oxygen and carbon comprises accelerating
      molecules of CO2 to a specific desired velocity, such that the
      accelerated molecules collide with a solid surface with kinetic
      energies between 10 and 300 eV. It will be understood that, within
      this kinetic energy range, the actual amount of energy required
      for the optimum conversion to O2 is determined by such parameters
      as the angle at which the accelerated CO2 molecule or ion
      approaches the surface prior to the collision and the atomic mass
      of the surface atoms. In many embodiments, larger kinetic energies
      are required to facilitate the reaction for larger angles of
      incidence ? with respect to the surface normal vector, wherein the
      least amount of required energy corresponds to normal incidence.
      More specifically, in many embodiments, if E0 is the required
      kinetic energy for maximum conversion at an angle of incidence ?,
      then the corresponding energy for normal incidence would be E0
      cos&lt;2 &gt;?.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] Without being bound by any theory, the kinematic analysis
      of the collisional process suggests that CO2 collisions with the
      provided surface under the disclosed herein conditions extensively
      perturb the CO2 intramolecular triatomic geometry and produce a
      strongly bent CO2 excited state, which, subsequently, dissociates
      to yield molecular as well as ionized O2. The disclosed herein
      process is reminiscent of exotic photochemical pathways for CO2
      decomposition, but, unlike any known pathway, which typically have
      very low O2 yields, the intramolecular CO2 decomposition conducted
      according to the embodiments of this invention has an estimated O2
      yield of ~33±3%. For comparison, the yield of previously reported
      CO2 photo-dissociation pathways is ~5±2%.<br>
      <br>
      [0048] Of course, it will be understood that any acceleration
      technique known in the art can be employed to bring CO2 molecules
      to the velocities and surface striking energies necessary to
      enable the method of this application. Several approaches are
      known in the art to produce positively charged CO2 ions and to
      controllably accelerate them with an applied electric field.
      Accordingly, in many embodiments, prior to acceleration, the CO2
      molecules are ionized via photo-excitation with ultraviolet light.
      In some other embodiments, the CO2 molecules are ionized by means
      of energetic electron bombardment under low pressure. In yet
      other, preferred embodiments, CO2 plasma is used to produce
      CO2&lt;+&gt;, which are accelerated against a biased surface with
      appropriate energy. In yet another embodiment, the solid surface
      may be moving against heated CO2 molecules at the required
      velocity.<br>
      <br>
      [0049] In many embodiments, O2 ions are directly produced in
      hyperthermal CO2&lt;+&gt; collisions against Au surfaces.
      Specifically, FIGS. 1a to 1c summarize exemplary scattering
      dynamics of such CO2&lt;+&gt;/surface collisions, by showing
      energy distributions for three of its molecular ion products:
      CO2&lt;+&gt; (FIG. 1a), O2&lt;+&gt; (FIG. 1b), and O2&lt;-
      &gt;(FIG. 1c) for various CO2&lt;+&gt; beam energies (E0) (as
      annotated on each panel), and shows that both O2 ions are detected
      at certain, relatively narrow energy ranges, along with some
      amount of survived CO2&lt;+&gt;. Accordingly, first, FIG. 1a shows
      that a very weak scattered CO2&lt;+&gt; signal is detected at beam
      energies (E0) below 100 eV. Furthermore, the scattered
      CO2&lt;+&gt; ion exit energy varies in proportion to the
      CO2&lt;+&gt; incidence energy, thus precluding physical sputtering
      as its origin. Observing dynamic CO2&lt;+&gt; signal is important
      because it proves that some CO2 survives the collision. In
      addition, the observed kinematics provide insight into the
      collision sequence of the constituent atoms of the triatomic
      molecule impinging onto the metal surface. Second, in FIGS. 1b and
      1c a strong scattered O2 signal is observed in both charge
      polarities, O2&lt;+&gt; and O2&lt;-&gt;. Here, in contrast to the
      O2&lt;-&gt; energy spectra, the O2&lt;+&gt; signal appears
      somewhat noisy, owing to detector (channeltron) operation. As
      observed for the scattered CO2&lt;+&gt;, the O2&lt;+&gt; and
      O2&lt;-&gt; ion exit energies increase monotonically with the
      CO2&lt;+&gt; incidence energy. For both polarities, the scattered
      O2 ion signal intensity goes through a maximum, then it dies out
      for E0&gt;150 eV. Interestingly, the O2&lt;+&gt; energy spectra
      develop a shoulder at ~20 eV for beam energies greater than 100 eV
      due to physical sputtering. As noted above, the O2&lt;+&gt; and
      O2&lt;-&gt; spectra intensities cannot be directly compared due to
      differences in how the detector is biased.<br>
      <br>
      [0050] Notably, the demonstrated O2 formation is unexpected, since
      collision-induced dissociation of CO2&lt;+&gt; is expected to
      occur via channel (I) at low collision energies, followed up by
      channel (III) at larger incidence energies. Indeed, FIGS. 2a-d
      show that all of the CO2&lt;+&gt; dissociation products:
      CO&lt;+&gt;, O&lt;+&gt;, O&lt;-&gt;, and C&lt;+&gt;, are detected
      in CO2&lt;+&gt;/Au collisions. Furthermore, the exit energies of
      the CO&lt;+&gt; and O&lt;- &gt;peaks vary with incidence energy
      (FIGS. 2a and 2c), indicating they are produced dynamically within
      the surface collision. However, as will be shown below, these
      fragments originate from the same excited state as the one
      producing the O2 ions. In contrast, the position of the O&lt;+&gt;
      and C&lt;+&gt; peaks is almost invariant around 20 eV (Exit
      Energy), suggesting a different origin. The appearance of
      scattered C&lt;+&gt; products for E0&gt;70 eV confirms that
      complete dissociation of CO2 via channel (III) also occurs.<br>
      <br>
      [0051] Since scattered CO2&lt;+&gt; ions are detected along with
      other collision products, a fraction of the incident ions must
      survive the hard collision. The kinematics (described in Yao, Y.
      &amp; Giapis, K. P. Kinematics of Eley-Rideal reactions at
      hyperthermal energies. Phys. Rev. Lett. 116, 253202 (2016), the
      disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference) of the
      scattered CO2&lt;+&gt; ions can help elucidate the scattering
      mechanism, which in turn provides clues for the formation of O2.
      Accordingly, FIG. 3a schematically illustrates the collision
      sequence of a linear CO2 molecule scattering on a solid surface
      according to many embodiments of this invention. In this scheme,
      the leading O atom collides with the surface first, followed by
      collision of the complementary CO moiety, and further followed by
      the molecule bending during the hard collision and forming of an
      excited triangular state, which, in turn, undergoes late
      dissociation into C+O2.<br>
      <br>
      [0052] FIG. 3b provides ion exit energies of CO2&lt;+&gt;,
      O2&lt;+&gt;, O2&lt;-&gt;, CO&lt;+&gt;, O&lt;-&gt;, and C&lt;+&gt;
      ions as a function of CO2&lt;+&gt; incidence energy, along with
      corresponding one-parameter linear fittings as solid lines. Here,
      the slope for CO2&lt;+&gt; is calculated from binary collision
      theory (BCT), assuming two sequential collisions as proposed in
      the scheme depicted in FIG. 3a; while the other slopes are
      calculated by assuming a common excited CO2 precursor state
      fragmenting spontaneously into daughter ions. It should be noted,
      that since the O2&lt;+&gt; exit energy data overlaps with the O2
      data, only the linear fitting for O2&lt;-&gt; is shown in FIG. 3b.
      In view of the data presented in FIG. 3b, first, if CO2&lt;+&gt;
      scatters as a whole molecule (i.e., a hard sphere with atomic mass
      of 44 Dalton), BCT predicts a kinematic factor of 0.6349, which
      does not fit well the energy data shown in FIG. 3b. This is not
      surprising given the quasi-linear triatomic nature of the
      CO2&lt;+&gt; ion (as explained in Walsh, A. D. The electronic
      orbitals, shapes, and spectra of polyatomic molecules. Part II.
      Non-hydride AB2 and BAC molecules J. Chem. Soc., 2266-2288 (1953);
      and Grimm, F. A. &amp; Larsson, M. A Theoretical Investigation of
      the Low Lying Electronic States of CO2&lt;+&gt; in Both Linear and
      Bent Configurations. Phys. Scr. 29, 337-343 (1984); the
      disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference). The
      next plausible scattering model assumes that parts of the
      molecular ion suffer distinct and successive collisions without
      molecular dissociation (as depicted in FIG. 3a): first the leading
      O atom collides with a surface Au atom, then the remaining CO
      moiety collides with the same Au atom. This model is similar to
      how diatomic molecules scatter on metal surfaces (as described,
      for example in Yao, Y. &amp; Giapis, K. P. Direct hydrogenation of
      dinitrogen and dioxygen via Eley-Rideal reactions. Angew. Chem.
      Int. Ed. 55, 11595-11599 (2016), the disclosure of which is
      incorporated herein by reference). Applying BCT to the sequential
      collision scattering model yields a kinematic factor of 0.7870,
      which fits perfectly the CO2&lt;+&gt; exit energy data provided in
      FIG. 3b. This scattering behavior has been verified for another
      quasi-linear molecular ion, NO2&lt;+&gt;, when scattering on Au
      surfaces (described in Pfeiffer, G. V. &amp; Allen, L. Electronic
      structure and geometry of NO2&lt;+&gt; and NO2&lt;-&gt;. J. Chem.
      Phys. 51, 190-202 (1969), the disclosure of which is incorporated
      herein by reference).<br>
      <br>
      [0053] Accordingly, in many embodiments, facilitating energetic
      CO2&lt;+&gt; scattering against a biased surface affects the
      angular configuration of the CO2 molecule during the collision and
      results in the unexpectedly efficient O2 production. Although not
      to be bound by theory, according to the disclosed herein mechanism
      and for many CO2 approach geometries, one of the O atoms of the
      CO2 molecule collides with the surface first and then rebounds in
      closer proximity to the other O atom in the resulting CO moiety.
      This mechanical deformation of the CO2 molecule is equivalent to a
      bending mode but occurs at much faster timescales than vibronic
      interactions (Renner-Teller effect). In addition, electronic
      excitation may also occur during the hard collision (as explained
      in Mace, J., Gordon, M. J. &amp; Giapis, K. P. Evidence of
      simultaneous double-electron promotion in F+ collisions with
      surfaces. Phys. Rev. Lett. 97, 257603 (2006), the disclosure of
      which is incorporated herein by reference). Therefore, according
      to many embodiments, a strongly bent, highly excited CO2* state is
      produced in CO2/surface collision, which next decomposes
      preferentially into C+O2 on the rebound from the surface.
      Furthermore, in some embodiments, charge exchange of the CO2
      dissociation fragments with the surface may aide the ionization of
      the O2 (FIG. 3a). In other embodiments, the excited state may
      split directly into ion pairs.<br>
      <br>
      [0054] Furthermore, the very weak signal observed for CO2&lt;+&gt;
      scattered according to the embodiments of the invention implies a
      very low survival probability. CO2&lt;+&gt; fragmentation can
      occur before, during, or after the hard collision with the
      surface. Only delayed fragmentation, for example, of a rebounding
      highly excited CO2* precursor state, can explain dissociation
      products having the same exit velocity as the precursor.
      Therefore, according to some embodiments, the kinematic factors of
      O2, CO and O products can be calculated from energy conservation
      to be 0.5724, 0.5008, and 0.2862, respectively. The linear
      O2&lt;-&gt;, CO&lt;+&gt; and O&lt;- &gt;ion exit data are fitted
      very well with these kinematic factors as slopes (FIG. 3b).
      However, the O+ and C&lt;+&gt; data cannot be fitted linearly,
      wherein their broader distributions suggest that other processes,
      such as surface sputtering, contribute to the measured peaks at
      lower energies, rendering de-convolution of the contribution from
      excited CO2* difficult.<br>
      <br>
      [0055] According to many embodiments and the observed kinematics
      of the ion exits from CO2&lt;+&gt; scattering on Au, molecular O2
      ions originate in surviving CO2 molecules or ions, possibly highly
      excited. To further illustrate this process, the distributions of
      the CO2&lt;+&gt;, O2&lt;+&gt;, O2&lt;-&gt;, CO&lt;+&gt; and O&lt;-
      &gt;ion exits for E0=56.4 eV are re-plotted in FIG. 4a as a
      function of the corresponding ion exit velocity. As seen in FIG.
      4a, the exit velocities of scattered CO&lt;+&gt;, O2&lt;+&gt; and
      O2&lt;-&gt; line up very well, thus confirming the single
      precursor origin, while the O&lt;- &gt;peak is somewhat broader
      than the latter three and overlaps partially with the O2 ion exit
      peaks. Surprisingly, the surviving CO2&lt;+&gt; is clearly faster
      than the O2 ion products. Therefore, the CO2* undergoing
      post-collisional dissociation according to the embodiments of the
      invention must become internally excited by inelastic processes,
      which, in turn, robs kinetic energy from the incident CO2&lt;+&gt;
      and results in its slower exit. Although the putative CO2* state
      cannot be directly detected, the additional energy needed to
      produce it can be estimated by assuming that the daughter O2&lt;-
      &gt;ion is emitted with the CO2* exit velocity. Then, the kinetic
      energy difference between CO2&lt;+&gt; and CO2* can be estimated
      and should be a measure of the relative excitation energy.
      Accordingly, FIG. 4b summarizes the results of this simple
      calculation as a function of E0. Notably, for E0&lt;70 eV, the
      relative excitation energy is about 6 eV—a value remarkably close
      to that required for CO2 partial dissociation according to channel
      (I) mechanism, or for direct O2 formation according to channel
      (II) mechanism. Coincidentally, the energy penalty to form the
      triangular CO2 state (&lt;1&gt;A1) is also 6 eV (as reported in
      Lu, Z., Chang, Y. C., Yin, Q. Z., Ng, C. Y. &amp; Jackson, W. M.
      Evidence for direct molecular oxygen production in CO2
      photodissociation, Science 346, 61-64 (2014), the disclosure of
      which is incorporated herein by reference). For E0 above 70 eV,
      the relative excitation energy increases while the scattered
      CO2&lt;+&gt; signal dies out (FIG. 1a). Simultaneously, C&lt;+&gt;
      ions become detectable suggesting the onset of complete
      dissociation via channel (Ill).<br>
      <br>
      [0056] Due to the violence of the surface collision, even the
      surviving CO2 molecular ions can be highly excited. The intercept
      of the CO2&lt;+&gt; data fitting in FIG. 3b reflects the inelastic
      energy loss for the CO2&lt;+&gt; ion exit, which amounts to 8.69
      eV—most of it going to internal excitation. Adding the inelastic
      energy loss of the surviving CO2&lt;+&gt;, the absolute excitation
      energy for the CO2* precursor could be as high as 14 eV. This
      energy is comparable to the VUV-photon and electron energy needed
      for the direct formation of O2 from CO2.<br>
      <br>
      [0057] An important question for the CO2&lt;+&gt; dissociation
      reaction into O2 is that of efficiency. One way to assess the
      efficiency of CO2 dissociation according to the embodiments of the
      application is in terms of selectivity of channel (II) versus the
      predominant channel (I). Kinematic analysis has shown that the
      CO&lt;+&gt;, O2&lt;- &gt;and O&lt;- &gt;products are directly
      formed from a common parent, the putative CO2* excited precursor
      state. At low CO2&lt;+&gt; incidence energies, the main
      dissociation pathways are: a) partial dissociation to form CO+O
      (channel (I)), and b) intramolecular reaction to form O2+C
      (channel (II)). Assuming that O2&lt;-&gt; and O&lt;- &gt;are
      formed by resonant electron transfer to the corresponding neutrals
      with the same efficiency, one can use the relative intensity of
      O2&lt;- &gt;and O&lt;- &gt;to estimate the selectivity for O2
      formation, S(O2), defined as follows:<br>
      <br>
      [mathematical formula]<br>
      <br>
      where I is the intensity of the corresponding negative ion exits.
      Notably, the electron affinities of O atoms and O2 are 1.46 eV and
      0.45 eV, respectively, wherein the difference implies that
      negative ion formation should be more efficient for 0 than for O2,
      due to the lower barrier to resonant electron attachment.
      Therefore, S(O2), as defined here, underestimates the actual O2
      formation selectivity. Furthermore, at high CO2&lt;+&gt; incidence
      energy, channel (III) also opens up, doubling the number of O
      atoms and O&lt;- &gt;ions produced and, thus, further worsening
      the estimate for O2 formation selectivity. With these limitations
      in mind, one can obtain a conservative estimate of the O2
      formation selectivity, which is plotted in FIG. 5 as a function of
      CO2&lt;+&gt; incidence energy. According to the data plotted in
      FIG. 5, the O2 formation selectivity increases with E0, goes
      through a maximum of ~33±3% at E0=70 eV, then decreases. The first
      increase is consistent with more energy available for direct O2
      formation. Remarkably, the turnaround point coincides with the
      opening up of the complete dissociation channel.<br>
      <br>
      [0058] Although the above discussed results are based on
      monitoring ionic products, it is well known in ion-surface
      collisions, that the majority ( ~98%) of the ions are neutralized
      by the surface prior to the collision and thus collide with the
      surface as neutrals, in this case neutral (uncharged) CO2.
      Likewise, many scattered CO2 molecules and products of CO2
      dissociation will not be charged, nevertheless will be
      contributing to the O2 yield.<br>
      <br>
      [0059] The direct O2 production by collisional activation of
      CO2&lt;+ &gt;according to the embodiments of the application is
      clearly more efficient than activation using other means, such as
      high-energy photons or electrons. Indeed, O2 formation by
      photo-excitation of CO2 has an estimated selectivity of only 5±2%
      vs. the partial dissociation channel, while DEA processes in CO2
      have minuscule cross sections for O2 production. In many
      embodiments, the higher O2 selectivity in the collisional
      activation process is attributed to more facile structural
      rearrangement in the CO2 during the hard collision, which brings
      the two O atoms closer together.<br>
      <br>
      [0060] In some embodiments, the atomic composition of the
      collision surface affects the O2 yield of CO2 splitting method of
      the application and must be optimized. Specifically, in many
      embodiments, surfaces that can be easily sputtered, i.e., where
      the surface erodes significantly at low incidence energy, or where
      carbon atoms stick preferentially to the surface to form coatings,
      are not desirable, as they can interfere with the surface
      excitation process that facilitates the reaction and poison the
      CO2 dissociation. Consequently, in many embodiments, the general
      requirement for the collision surface is that it contains an atom
      with atomic mass larger than 16-18 Dalton, which is the atomic
      mass of the elemental oxygen, including its isotopes. In many
      preferred embodiments, the atomic mass of the collision surface
      elements is between 20 and 200 Dalton. Furthermore, although
      surfaces comprising atoms with atomic mass larger than 20 Dalton
      are acceptable, surfaces comprising atoms with atomic mass heavier
      than 40 Dalton are preferred. In many embodiments, the collision
      surface comprises of one or more element found in rows 4, 5, and 6
      of the Periodic table or such element's oxide. In some such
      embodiments, the collision surface is comprised of one or more
      element from the list: Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, CO, Ni, Cu, Zn, Ge, Y,
      Zr, Nb, Mo, Ru, Rh, Pd, Ag, In, Sn, Sb, Te, Ce, Hf, Ta, Re, Os,
      Ir, Pt, Au, Pb, Bi, an oxide of any element thereof, or any
      combination thereof. In contrast, in many embodiments, surfaces
      comprising certain elements that might interfere with the CO2
      dissociation reaction must be avoided. For example, surfaces
      comprising tungsten (W) must be avoided in many embodiments, as
      such surfaces, when oxidized, form a volatile tungsten oxide that
      vaporizes and consumes the surface.<br>
      <br>
      [0061] Furthermore, in many embodiments, the collision enabled CO2
      splitting reaction is generic to metal surfaces (FIGS. 6 and 7),
      and occurs even on oxides (FIG. 8). Specifically, FIGS. 6 and 7
      demonstrate that, in some embodiments, efficient splitting of CO2
      into O2 can be achieved via CO2 collisions with Pt surfaces, while
      FIG. 8 shows that, in other embodiments, the similar behavior is
      observed in CO2 collisions with silicon oxide surfaces.<br>
      <br>
      [0062] In many embodiments, the CO2 splitting method of the
      instant application may be exploited in plasma reactors, wherein
      ion/wall collisions occur spontaneously at energies determined by
      the plasma potential. Remarkably, past attempts at using CO2
      plasmas were plugged by relatively low O2 conversion, ostensibly
      because of the slow kinetics for the two-step O2 formation process
      in gas-phase collisions (as detailed in Spencer, L. F. &amp;
      Gallimore, A. D. Efficiency of CO2 dissociation in a
      radio-frequency discharge. Plasma Chem. Plasma Phys. 31, 79-89
      (2010), the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by
      reference). However, according to the embodiments of the
      invention, the O2 yield is greatly improved with the following
      three modifications to plasma reactor methods of CO2 splitting: a)
      maximizing the CO2&lt;+&gt; ion density, b) tuning the plasma
      potential between 40 and 150 eV, and c) providing grounded metal
      electrodes to enable CO2&lt;+&gt; ion/surface collisions.<br>

      embodiments relate to the above disclosure. It will be understood
      that the embodiments presented in this section are exemplary in
      nature and are provided to support and extend the broader
      disclosure, these embodiments are not meant to confine or
      otherwise limit the scope of the invention.<br>
      <br>
      [0064] All experiments described in the instant application were
      carried out in a custom-made low-energy ion scattering apparatus
      described in detail in Gordon, M. J. &amp; Giapis, K. P.
      Low-energy ion beam line scattering apparatus for surface science
      investigations. Rev. Sci. Instrum. 76, 083302 (2005), the
      disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. The
      CO2&lt;+&gt; ion beam was extracted from an inductively-coupled
      plasma, struck in a reactor held at 2 mTorr using a CO2/Ar/Ne gas
      mixture supplied with 500 W RF power at 13.56 MHz. Ions delivered
      to a grounded surface at 45° incidence angle; typical beam
      currents of 5 to 15 µA were spread over a ~3 mm spot. Beam energy
      was varied between 40-200 eV by externally adjusting the plasma
      potential. Typical target surfaces were polycrystalline Au foils
      (5N), sputter-cleaned with an Ar+ ion gun before each run.
      Scattered ion products, exiting at an angle of 45° in the
      scattering plane, were energy- and mass-resolved using an
      electrostatic ion energy analyzer and a quadruple mass
      spectrometer, respectively. All ions were detected using a channel
      electron multiplier, biased as appropriate to detect positive or
      negative ions. Differences in detector bias precluded a direct
      comparison of signal intensities between product ions of different
