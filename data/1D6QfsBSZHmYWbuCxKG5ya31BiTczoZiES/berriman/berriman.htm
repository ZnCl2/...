      <p><b>Abstract --- </b>A combustible mixture of air and minute
        fuel droplets is produced for supply to the cylinders of an
        internal combustion engine. This mixture is formed by accurately
        controlling both the atomization of fuel and the mass flow rate
        of air over substantially the entire operating range of the
        engine. These controls are accomplished by introducing liquid
        fuel into a stream of intake air and uniformly distributing the
        fuel in the air followed by passing the air and fuel mixture
        through a constricted zone to increase the velocity of the
        mixture to sonic. The sonic velocity air at the constricted zone
        divides the fuel into minute droplets that are uniformly
        entrained throughout the air stream. The area of the constricted
        zone and the quantity of fuel introduced are adjustably varied
        in correlation with operating demands imposed upon the engine.
        Downstream from the constricted sonic zone, the air and fuel
        mixture is accelerated to supersonic velocity in a supersonic
        zone without imparting substantial turbulent flow thereto.
        Thereafter the mixture is decelerated to subsonic velocity in a
        subsonic zone to produce a shock zone where the fuel droplets
        entrained in the air are believed to be further subdivided and
        uniformly distributed throughout the combustible mixture before
        the mixture is supplied to the engine cylinders. The supersonic
        and subsonic velocities occur in a gradually increasing
        cross-sectional area corresponding to that of a conical section
        having an apex angle in the range of about 6 to 18 degrees. </p>
      <p><b>Description</b> </p>
      <p><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>The present invention relates generally to gasoline internal
        combustion engines and more particularly concerns a method and
        apparatus for mixing and modulating liquid fuel and intake air
        in order to reduce the undesirable exhaust emissions from such
        engines. </p>
      <p>In nearly all gasoline engines used in automotive applications
        today, the fuel and air are metered and mixed by a carburetor
        connected to the intake manifold of the engine. While these
        carburetors differ considerably in detail, their overall
        operation is basically the same in that fuel is drawn from a
        float-controlled fuel reservoir through one or more small fuel
        jets by the pressure drop created as the air flows through a
        fixed venturi section formed in the throat of the carburetor.
        During normal operation the air flow through the carburetor and,
        hence, the amount of fuel drawn through the metering jets is
        controlled by a butterfly-valve-type throttle plate. However,
        because the air flow through the carburetor varies markedly
        during different engine operating conditions, such as: idle,
        acceleration, full throttle, and deceleration, conventional
        carburetors are commonly provided with separate idle jets,
        acceleration pumps, and multiple venturi sections. Even so, the
        metering function of the carburetor falls short of providing the
        desired air-fuel mixture to the engine at all operating
        conditions and the mixing function performed by the carburetor
        is even worse. </p>
      <p>Except at idle essentially all of the mixing in a conventional
        carburetor occurs as the fuel and air pass together through the
        throttle opening. Assuming atmospheric pressure of 29.9 inches
        of mercury (in. Hg.) exists at the carburetor inlet, the air
        flow through the throttle opening will be at sonic velocity when
        the pressure at the throttle opening is 53% of atmospheric. This
        is equal to a pressure of 15.6 in. Hg. and is referred to as the
        critical pressure. However, since it is common to measure the
        condition within the intake manifold in terms of inches of
        mercury vacuum rather than pressure, this critical pressure is
        equal to 14.3 in. Hg. vacuum (29.9-15.6=14.3) and this condition
        will be hereinafter referred to as the threshold vacuum.
        Moreover, due to the shapes of the carburetor throat and
        throttle plate, a vacuum in the intake manifold only slightly
        below threshold vacuum will just produce sonic velocity through
        the throttle opening. This condition, which is referred to
        hereinafter as the "unchoking point", occurs at about 12 in. Hg.
        vacuum for a typical carburetor or 17.9 in. Hg. pressure
        (29.9-12=17.9). Sonic velocity of the intake air through the
        throttle opening also occurs at manifold vacuums above the
        unchoking point, in other words, in the range of about 12 to 24
        in. Hg. during normal operation. Expressed slightly different,
        when the pressure in the intake manifold of a typical carburetor
        is about 60% of the pressure at the carburetor inlet
        (60%.times.29.9=17.9) or less, sonic velocity of the intake air
        occurs through the throttle opening. For reasons explained
        below, the present invention provides sonic velocity over a
        wider range and even when the pressure in the intake manifold is
        substantially more than 60% of the pressure at the inlet. </p>
      <p>When the velocity of the intake air through the throttle
        opening is at sonic velocity, the high velocity air divides the
        liquid fuel into fine droplets. However, because the throttle
        plate slopes across the carburetor throat below the fuel jet,
        nearly all of the fuel and about half of the air flows through
        the lower throttle opening but only a small amount of fuel
        passes with the other half of the air through the upper throttle
        opening. Although some mixing of these two streams of fuel and
        air does occur below the throttle plate, the asymmetrical
        distribution of the fuel in the intake air is substantially
        never completely overcome. </p>
      <p>At manifold vacuum conditions below the unchoking point, the
        mixing of fuel and air by the carburetor is even worse. This
        normally occurs at all manifold vacuum conditions below about 12
        inches Hg. when the engine is accelerated or under load. Under
        these conditions, the air flow is below sonic velocity,
        frequently well below, and more fuel is being introduced. The
        fuel distribution is still asymmetric and mixing at the throttle
        opening and below is even less effective due to the much larger
        droplets which are formed by the lower velocity air. In
        addition, if the carburetor includes an accelerator pump, as
        most do, the additional squirt of fuel that it provides usually
        comes just when the throttle is being opened rapidly and the air
        velocity is falling well below sonic. Thus, a stream of liquid
        fuel may pass directly into the intake manifold. </p>
      <p>During idle conditions, the fuel is typically introduced
        through an idle jet located just below the lower side of the
        throttle plate when it is in the idle position. Naturally, this
        results in asymmetrical fuel distribution in the intake air and
        although the air flow through the throttle opening is typically
        at sonic velocity during idling conditions, the idle fuel is not
        very effectively or uniformly mixed with the intake air. </p>
      <p>Largely, as a result of these shortcomings in current
        carburetor arrangements, there are wide cylinder to cylinder and
        cycle to cycle variations in the ratio and amount of fuel and
        air delivered to the engine at different operating conditions.
        This is true even when the metering function of the carburetor
        initially provides the desired air-fuel ratio at the manifold
        inlet because the mixing function of the carburetor is so poorly
        performed that streams of liquid fuel frequently pass into the
        intake manifold, wetting portions of the manifold walls and
        actually collecting in pools of liquid fuel in certain areas of
        the manifold, and some of this unmixed liquid fuel is inducted
        into the engine cylinders. </p>
      <p>In an effort to overcome this situation, various arrangements
        have been adopted to heat the intake manifold in order to
        vaporize the liquid fuel prior to induction into the engine
        cylinders. The most common of such arrangements are hot spots
        and heat risers from the exhaust manifold to heat the area of
        the intake manifold immediately below the carburetor. A hot
        water path through the intake manifold is also frequently
        employed. Even with these arrangements, however, a completely
        uniform air-fuel mixture throughout the manifold is rarely
        achieved. Consequently, the air-fuel mixture delivered to some
        of the cylinders is often too rich to achieve complete
        combustion. On the other hand, the air-fuel mixture delivered to
        other cylinders is at times too lean to achieve proper burning
        and this causes those cylinders to misfire. As used in the
        present application, it will be understood that a rich air-fuel
        mixture is one that contains more than one pound of fuel for
        every 15.5 pounds of air and that a lean air-fuel mixture is one
        that contains less than one pound of fuel for every 15.5 pounds
        of air. </p>
      <p>Whether the problem is misfiring due to too lean an air-fuel
        mixture or incomplete combustion due to too rich a mixture, the
        result is that unburned fuel is exhausted from the cylinders.
        This is undesirable not only because of the loss in power and
        efficiency that results but also because these unburned or
        incompletely burned fuel components pass into the atmosphere as
        undesirable pollutants. </p>
      <p>The principal air pollutants emanating from internal combustion
        engines have been identified as unburned hydrocarbons (HC),
        carbon monoxide (CO), and the oxides of nitrogen (NO.sub.x). The
        desired end products of complete combustion of the fuel and air,
        of course, would be carbon dioxide and water with only a trace
        of other constituents in the presence of unreacted nitrogen. </p>
      <p>Prior to enactment of federal and state standards on exhaust
        emissions, a standard automobile engine in good running
        condition would produce an average of about 900 ppm HC, 3.9% CO
        and 1075 ppm NO.sub.x during normal operation. The initial
        federal standards, effective January, 1968, covered only HC and
        CO emissions and were stated in terms of concentrations of 275
        ppm HC and 1.5% CO. In terms of the subsequently prescribed
        7-mode cycle test which is to simulate a typical 20 minute trip
        of a car from cold start through city traffic, the 1968 federal
        standards correspond to about 3.4 g/mi HC and 34 g/mi CO.
        Effective January 1970, these were reduced to 2.2 g/mi HC and 23
        g/mi CO which correspond to concentrations of about 180 ppm HC
        and 1% CO for the average car. </p>
      <p>The standards originally proposed for 1975 (Fed. Reg. Vol. 33,
        No. 108, June 4, 1968) were 0.5 g/mi (about 40 ppm) of
        hydrocarbon, 11.0 g/mi (about 0.5%) of CO, and 0.9 g/mi (about
        240 ppm) of NO.sub.x, based on the 7-mode cycle, that was
        adopted. In 1970, new standards for 1975 and 1976 were
        established along with a new driving cycle (Fed. Reg. Vol. 35,
        No. 219, Nov. 10, 1970). On 1975 model cars, hydrocarbon must
        not exceed 0.46 g/mi (about 37 ppm) and CO 4.7 g/mi (about
        0.2%). On 1976 model cars, it is proposed that No.sub.x be
        limited to 0.4 g/mi (about 110 ppm). These emissions are to be
        obtained using a constant volume sampling system and while
        driving a car through a new 22 minute driving cycle. It will be
        appreciated that the standards were hence reduced in two ways,
        by lowering the actual numbers and also by changing the
        analytical method. </p>
      <p>The automobile engine manufacturers were able--with some
        difficulties--to meet the 1968 federal emission standards
        primarily by adopting one or more of the following engine
        modifications: </p>
      <p>(1) retarding the spark-ignition </p>
      <p>(2) recalibrating the carburetor for leaner air-fuel mixtures </p>
      <p>(3) heating the intake manifold </p>
      <p>(4) changing valve timing </p>
      <p>(5) increasing stroke to bore ratio </p>
      <p>(6) injecting air into the exhaust manifold </p>
      <p>(7) improving combustion chamber design </p>
      <p>Further improvements in these areas have also made it possible
        to meet the federal standards for 1970. </p>
      <p>However, the stringent nature of the federal exhaust emission
        standards for 1975 are such that it is believed that even the
        most effective combination of all of the above measures will not
        be sufficient even with added catalytic or thermal reactors and,
        indeed, serious concern is being voiced as to whether or not the
        internal combustion engine can economically be made sufficiently
        polution free to meet these projected standards. </p>
      <p><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>Accordingly, it is the primary aim of the present invention to
        provide a new and improved liquid fuel and intake air mixing and
        modulating device suitable for installation on both new and used
        automobile engines which, without other substantial
        modifications, will effect a substantial reduction of all
        undesirable exhaust emissions in new cars to levels well below
        the federal requirements originally projected for 1975 and near
        to those now projected for 1975-76, and which will effect a
        substantial reduction in such emissions in used cars to a level
        surpassing the projected requirements for used cars. </p>
      <p>A further object of the invention is to provide a method and
        apparatus for mixing and modulating liquid fuel and intake air
        which is effective to finely divide and entrain the liquid fuel
        in the intake air and to form such a substantially uniform and
        homogeneous mixture, preferably without the fuel being
        completely vaporized, so that substantially complete combustion
        occurs each cycle in every cylinder and that, due to the nature
        of the mixture formed, misfire does not occur when operating at
        air-fuel ratios on the order of 20:1. </p>
      <p>A related object of the invention is to provide a new and
        improved liquid fuel and intake air mixing and modulating
        apparatus and method of the above character which, due to the
        nature of the air-fuel mixture formed, results in operation of
        the engine with combustion taking place at lower temperatures
        and possibly somewhat differently to thereby reduce the
        production of the oxides of nitrogen at peak operating
        conditions and also permit a reduction in the fuel octane
        requirement even for high compression ratio gasoline engines. </p>
      <p>Another object of the invention is to provide a method and
        apparatus for mixing and modulating liquid fuel and intake air
        which not only satisfies the foregoing objects over
        substantially the entire range of engine operating conditions
        but which also results in improved engine response and a
        decrease in fuel consumption for a given power output or an
        increase in power output for a given fuel consumption as
        compared with similar engines not equipped with the liquid fuel
        and intake air mixing and modulating apparatus of the present
        invention. </p>
      <p>Finally, it is an object to provide a liquid fuel and intake
        air mixing and modulating device as characterized above which is
        relatively inexpensive to manufacture, install and service and
        which is also substantially trouble free and dependable in
        operation. </p>
      <p>In accordance with the present invention, method and apparatus
        are provided for producing a uniform combustible mixture of air
        and minute liquid fuel droplets for supply to the cylinders of
        an internal combustion engine. Liquid fuel is introduced into a
        stream of intake air and uniformly distributed therein. The
        velocity of the air and fuel mixture is substantially increased
        by passing it through a throat zone, and the fuel in minutely
        divided and uniformly entrained as droplets throughout the air
        at the throat zone. The area of the throat zone and the quantity
        of fuel introduced into the stream of intake air are adjustably
        varied in correlation with operating demands imposed on the
        engine. Downstream from the throat zone, the air and fuel
        mixture is accelerated to supersonic velocity in a supersonic
        zone. Thereafter the mixture is decelerated to subsonic velocity
        in a subsonic zone to produce a shock zone where the fuel
        droplets are believed to be further subdivided and uniformly
        distributed throughout the combustible mixture. The mixture is
        then supplied to the engine cylinders. </p>
      <p>The air flows through the throat zone at sonic velocity
        throughout substantially the entire range of engine operation.
        Moreover, the supersonic and subsonic zones provide a gradually
        increasing cross-sectional area corresponding to that of a
        conical section having an apex angle in the range of about 6 to
        18 degrees for efficient recovery of the kinetic energy of the
        supersonic velocity air and fuel mixture as static pressure. </p>
      <p>The quantity of fuel delivered into the air stream may be
        controlled to provide a substantially constant air-to-fuel ratio
        of the mixture over a wide range of engine conditions. Since the
        air flow is maintained at sonic velocity through the throat zone
        over a wide range of engine conditions, the mass flow rate of
        air being supplied to the engine is directly proportional to the
        cross-sectional area of the throat zone. Thus, by controlling
        the rate of fuel delivered to the air stream in direct
        proportion to the area of the throat zone, the air-to-fuel ratio
        of the mixture supplied to the engine remains substantially
        constant. </p>

      <p><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>Turning now to the drawings, there is shown in FIG. 1A a liquid
        fuel and intake air mixing and modulating device 20 of the
        present invention illustrated schematically as installed on the
        intake manifold 21 of a conventional gasoline engine, shown here
        in phantom. While the engine illustrated is an inline 6-cylinder
        engine, the liquid fuel and intake air mixing and modulating
        device 20 of the present invention is not limited for use on
        such an engine. Rather, it should be understood that the present
        invention is equally applicable for use with gasoline engines
        having different cylinder numbers and arrangements such as, for
        example, but without limitation: 2, 4, 6, 8 and 12 cylinders in
        inline, V, horizontally opposed, and rotary arragements. </p>
      <p>As is conventional in many 6-cylinder inline engines the intake
        ports of the front, rear and center pairs of cylinders (not
        shown) are siamesed. Accordingly, as illustrated in FIG. 1A, the
        intake manifold 21 is provided with three branches 22, each of
        which serves the intake ports of a respective one of the pairs
        of front, rear and center cylinders. However, the invention is
        not limited to the illustrated manifold arrangement and the
        manifold may be provided with a separate branch for each
        cylinder, if desired. </p>
      <p>In accordance with the present invention, the liquid fuel and
        intake air mixing and modulating device 20 of the present
        invention includes an intake air duct 25 which is provided with
        means for selectively constricting the flow of intake air to
        significantly increase the velocity thereof prior to admitting
        the intake air into the intake manifold 21. As shown in FIG. 1A,
        the illustrated means for constricting or throttling the flow of
        intake air includes a member 26 disposed concentrically and in
        axially movable relation to a converging section 27 of the
        intake air duct 25. In the preferred embodiment, the movable
        member 26 and the converging section 27 of the duct 25 are
        formed with generally circular cross-sections so as to define
        therebetween a throat in the form of an annular orifice, the
        cross-sectional area of which is variable as the member 26 is
        moved, and which defines a uniform opening around its
        circumference for each position of the member 26. It will be
        understood, of course, that other forms of throat constrictions
        may also be employed without departing from the present
        invention. </p>
      <p>FIG. 1B diagrammatically illustrates a mixing device 8 of the
        present invention for supplying a uniform combustible mixture of
        minute liquid fuel droplets and air to the intake manifold of an
        internal combustion engine. Intake air is drawn through the
        device 8 from a converging intake air zone 9 in response to the
        intake manifold vacuum. As the air travels deeper into the
        intake air zone 9, its velocity is increased. Liquid fuel 10
        from lines 11 is introduced at 12 into the intake air stream and
        uniformly distributed therein before the mixture passes through
        a throat or constricted zone 13 located between an axially
        movable plug or modulator 14 and the adjacent wall structure.
        The velocity of the air is increased to sonic in the constricted
        zone 13 to thereby minutely divide and uniformly entrain the
        fuel as droplets throughout the air stream. The cross-sectional
        area of the constricted zone 13 together with the quantity of
        fuel 10 introduced at 12 into the stream of air are adjustably
        varied in correlation with operating demands imposed upon the
        engine to which the mixture is supplied. Adjustment of the
        cross-sectional area of the constricted zone 13 is accomplished
        by axially moving the plug or modulator 14 in response to the
        engine demands while the quantity of fuel introduced is
        controlled by suitable valving 15. </p>
      <p>As the air and fuel mixture passes downstream from the
        constricted zone 13 the velocity thereof is accelerated to
        supersonic velocity in a supersonic zone 16 without substantial
        turbulent flow therein. Immediately thereafter the mixture is
        decelerated to subsonic velocity in a subsonic zone 17 to
        produce shock zone 18 where the fuel droplets entrained in the
        air are believed to be further subdivided and uniformly
        distributed throughout the combustible mixture. The shock zone
        18 occurs at the transition between the supersonic and subsonic
        zones, 16 and 17, respectively. </p>
      <p>It is significant that the kinetic energy of the high velocity
        intake air and entrained fuel is efficiently recovered as static
        pressure in the subsonic zone 17. For efficient energy recovery,
        the supersonic and subsonic zones share common diverging walls
        19 that provide a gradually increasing cross-sectional area
        corresponding to that of a conical section having an apex angle
        in the range of 6 to 18 degrees. Such recovery enables sonic air
        flow through the constricted zone 13 at all manifold vacuum
        levels of the engine down at least to five inches mercury
        vacuum. Such vacuum levels represent virtually the entire
        operating range of the engine. At the same time, unlike
        conventional carburetors, because air is maintained at sonic
        velocity through the constricted zone the mass flow rate of air
        being supplied to the engine is directly proportional to the
        cross-sectional area of the constricted zone. Thus, by
        controlling the rate of fuel delivered to the air in direct
        proportion of the area of the constricted zone, the air-to-fuel
        ratio of the mixture supplied to the intake manifold remains
        substantially constant. Moreover, the engine may be operated
        without misfire on a relatively lean and unvarying air-to-fuel
        ratio substantially in excess of those normally encountered in
        conventional carburetors. </p>
      <p>Referring now to the schematic illustrations presented in FIGS.
        2A and 2B, there are shown two exemplary forms of the means for
        restricting the throat of the intake air duct 25. As shown in
        FIG. 2A, the duct 25a is provided with an upper or upstream
        portion 27a of converging cross-section in the downstream
        direction with respect to the flow of intake air. The point of
        maximum constriction of the duct 25a is represented here by a
        plane 28a passing transversely through the duct 25a and below
        the plane 28a the duct is provided with a portion 29a of
        diverging cross-section. In this embodiment, the axially movable
        member 26a is formed with a converging lower end portion having
        an angle of convergence less than the angle of convergence of
        the portion 27a of the duct 25a. Since both the converging
        portion 27a of the duct and the member 26a are preferably formed
        with circular cross-sectional shapes, there is formed
        therebetween a variable area annular orifice or throat zone
        located in the plane 28a. </p>
      <p>In the embodiment schematically illustrated in FIG. 2B, the
        duct 25b is also provided with an upper or upstream portion 27b
        of converging cross-section in the downstream direction but here
        the axially movable member 26b is formed with a converging lower
        end portion having an angle of convergence greater than the
        angle of convergence of the portion 27b. This arrangement
        provides that the point of maximum constriction in the duct 25b
        lies in a movable plane 28b which passes through the widest
        portion of the member 26b and intermediate the ends of the
        converging portion 27b. It will also be seen that, due to the
        differing angles of convergence of the member 26b and portion
        27b, there is formed an annular section of diverging
        cross-section located in the duct 25b below the plane 28b. The
        duct 25b is also preferably formed with a portion 29b of
        diverging cross-section downstream of the converging portion 27b
        with respect to the direction of flow. While the planes 28a and
        28b are both shown as defined by sharp edges, it will be
        understood that these planes may have some thickness, on the
        order of about 0.1 inch, for example. </p>
      <p>Returning to FIG. 1A, the member 26 and converging section 27
        cooperate to define a throat to constrict the flow of intake air
        drawn through the duct 25 resulting in a significant increase in
        velocity of the intake air prior to its admission into the
        intake manifold 21. It will also be understood that during
        normal operation of the engine, the pressure in the intake
        manifold 21 is below atmospheric, i.e. a vacuum condition exists
        in the manifold. Generally this vacuum ranges between 6 and 24
        inches of mercury vacuum depending on the engine speed and load
        conditions. The intake manifold vacuum may, however, fall below
        6 inches Hg during rapid acceleration and may occasionally
        exceed 24 inches Hg. during rapid deceleration. </p>
      <p>As the flow of intake air is constricted in the variable area
        throat zone between the member 26 and converging section 27, the
        air velocity at the throat constriction increases and the air
        pressure decreases. When the pressure at the constriction is at
        the critical pressure of 53% of atmospheric pressure, the flow
        of intake air at the constriction is at sonic velocity. Since
        the pressure at the constriction is always critical when the
        manifold pressure is equal to or less than the critical
        pressure, sonic velocity at the constriction is obtained at all
        manifold vacuum conditions above the threshold vacuum of 14.3
        inches Hg. In other words, in the range of 14.3-24 inches of Hg.
        vacuum. </p>
      <p>By gradually increasing the cross-sectional area of the intake
        air duct below the point of maximum constriction of the throat,
        i.e. below the variable area throat zone, a diffuser is formed.
        The cross-sectional area increases with distance from the throat
        constriction similar to that provided by a cone having an apex
        angle of about 6.degree. to 18.degree., preferably 8.degree. to
        12.degree.. Such a diffuser section is shown in exaggerated form
        in the embodiments illustrated in FIGS. 1B, 2A and 2B. The
        gradual increase in cross-sectional area provided by the
        diffuser section enables a substantial portion of the kinetic
        energy of the high velocity intake air to be recovered as static
        pressure and this substantially lowers the intake manifold
        vacuum unchoking point at which sonic velocity through the
        throat is still achieved. In addition, with an efficient
        diffuser section and sonic velocity at the throat, at all
        manifold vacuums above the unchoke point, the flow of intake air
        just downstream of the throat is accelerated to supersonic
        velocity and then the air passes through a shock zone as the
        velocity is abruptly reduced below sonic and the pressure
        returns to the pressure prevailing within the manifold. As will
        be described hereinafter, the liquid fuel and intake air mixing
        and modulating device of the present invention is effective to
        produce sonic velocity at the throat and supersonic velocity and
        a shock wave in the diffuser section over substantially the
        entire range of intake manifold vacuum conditions encountered in
        normal operation of the engine. </p>
      <p>While the term diffuser is used herein as descriptive of the
        divergent section of gradually increasing cross-sectional area
        below the throat constriction, those skilled in the art will
        recognize that, technically speaking, the initial portion of
        this divergent section actually functions as a supersonic nozzle
        under the conditions just described. Thus, with reference to
        FIG. 1B, a supersonic zone 16 is provided immediately downstream
        from the throat zone 13, and the velocity of the air and fuel
        mixture is accelerated to supersonic velocity in the supersonic
        zone when the manifold vacuum is above the unchoke point. On the
        other hand, when the manifold vacuum is below the unchoke point,
        supersonic velocity no longer exists in zone 16. The supersonic
        zone 16 connects with a subsonic zone 17 in the gradually
        increasing cross sectional area 19 below the throat zone 13. The
        transition from supersonic to subsonic velocity produces a
        non-turbulent shock zone 18 when the manifold vacuum is above
        the unchoke point, and the fuel droplets are believed to be
        further subdivided and distributed throughout the air as they
        pass through the shock zone. </p>
      <p>Pursuant to the present invention, liquid fuel is introduced
        substantially uniformly into the flow path of the intake air in
        a fuel delivery zone at or before the point of maximum
        constriction of the throat of the mixing and modulating device
        20. As the intake air and fuel pass together through the fuel
        delivery zone and then through the throat constriction, or zone,
        the liquid fuel is finely divided and entrained in the high
        velocity intake air. Moreover, when the velocity of air at the
        throat is at sonic velocity, a substantial and useful portion of
        the finely divided fuel remains entrained in the intake air as
        it passes through the intake manifold and into the cylinders of
        the engine. With an efficient diffuser section, after the fuel
        is divided and entrained at the throat, the velocity of the
        intake air increases to a supersonic peak velocity in the
        diffuser section and then abruptly shocks down to subsonic
        velocity and the pressure condition prevailing generally in the
        intake manifold. This rapid rise and fall in intake air velocity
        subjects the larger entrained liquid fuel droplets to high shear
        forces in successive forward and reverse directions and breaks
        this fuel up into even finer droplet form than that previously
        formed in the fuel delivery and throat zones. </p>
      <p>It has been found that an otherwise conventional gasoline
        engine fitted with the liquid fuel and intake air mixing and
        modulating device 20 of the present invention produces
        significantly lower levels of undesirable exhaust emissions than
        the same engine with its normal carburetor. For example, a 1963
        Rambler American 220 with a six-cylinder inline engine of 197
        cubic inch displacement and an 8.7:1 compression ratio was
        tested for exhaust emissions when equipped with its standard one
        barrel carburetor and when equipped with a liquid fuel and
        intake air mixing and modulating device of the present
        invention. </p>
      <p>The car was tested on a standard Clayton chassis dynamometer
        with a normal road load effectively applied at the rear wheels
        of the car. Hydrocarbon exhaust emissions in parts per million
        were continuously monitored with a Beckman non-dispersive
        infra-red spectrometer sensitized to hexane. The percentage of
        free oxygen in the exhaust was also continuously monitored with
        a Beckman paramagnetic oxygen analyzer. The percentage of carbon
        monoxide in the exhaust was periodically spot checked with a
        Bacharach carbon monoxide analyzer. A modified Saltzman solution
        was used to periodically determine the oxides of nitrogen
        present in the exhaust in parts per million. A comparison of the
        exhaust emissions of the car with its regular carburetor and
        with the mixing and modulating device of the present invention
        is presented in Table I for operation of the car at both 30 and
        50 mph. In each case, the figures presented represent the
        average of several test samples. </p>

        percentage of free oxygen in the exhaust was greatly increased
        during the 50 mph test when the car was equipped with the mixing
        and modulating device of the present invention. The levels of HC

        invention which was used on the Rambler car engine for the above
        tests is illustrated in more detail in FIGS. 3-5. As shown here,
        the device A, generally indicated at 30, includes an intake air
        duct 31 having a portion 32 converging in the downstream
        direction with respect to the flow of intake air. To constrict
        or throttle the flow of intake air through the portion 32 an
        axially movable throat modulator 33 is disposed coaxially in the
        duct 31. The modulator 33 is formed with a converging lower end
        portion 34 which together with the lower end of the converging
        portion 32 form a throat in the form of a variable area annular
        orifice 35 (see FIG. 5). </p>
      <p>Intake air is drawn into the duct 31 through an intake conduit
        36 which projects tangentially through a cover 37 over the large
        end of the duct. The intake air then flows through the duct and
        the converging portion 32 where the flow is constricted by the
        modulator 33 to substantially increase the velocity of the
        intake air prior to its passing through a discharge conduit 38
        and into the intake manifold of the engine. It will also be
        noted that the duct 31 includes a diverging portion 39 located
        downstream of the point of maximum constriction on throat 35 and
        in this regard the arrangement of the device 30 is generally
        similar to that schematically illustrated in FIG. 2A. </p>
      <p>Liquid fuel is supplied to the mixing and modulating device 30
        illustrated in FIGS. 3-5 by means of a fuel nozzle 40. In the
        illustrated embodiment, the fuel nozzle 40 projects axially into
        the duct 31 through the cover 37 and the discharge end of the
        nozzle is centered in the duct well above the point of maximum
        constriction of the throat. The liquid fuel is preferably
        sprayed into the duct 31 from the discharge end of the nozzle in
        a substantially symmetrical pattern. To this end, the
        illustrated nozzle 40 is of the air aspirating type and includes
        a baffle 41 located at right angles to the discharge end of the
        nozzle to symmetrically distribute the liquid fuel in a
        generally radial direction. For the tests tabulated above, the
        nozzle was supplied with air under pressure of about 40 psi and
        the flow of fuel through the nozzle was regulated by a valve
        (not shown). </p>
      <p>To insure that the liquid fuel is introduced substantially
        symmetrically into the path of the high velocity intake air
        flowing through the constricted throat 35, the duct 31 and
        throat 35 are preferably mounted with their axes oriented
        substantially vertically. With this arrangement, the liquid
        fuel, which is sprayed from the nozzle 40 and reaches the inner
        wall of the duct 31, runs down the sloping wall of the
        converging portion in a generally uniform manner to the point of
        maximum constriction or throat 35 defined between the portion 32
        and the modulator 33. At or before the point of maximum
        constriction (represented by the section line 5--5 in FIG. 3)
        the high velocity air strips the liquid fuel film from the wall
        and finely divides and entrains the fuel in the intake air. </p>
      <p>For controlling the degree of constriction at the throat and
        thus modulating the flow of intake air therethrough the
        modulator 33 is axially movable. In the embodiment illustrated
        in FIG. 3, the modulator 33 is mounted on a control rod 45
        threadably received in a boss 46 formed on the discharge conduit
        38. A knurled knob 47 is provided on the lower end of the rod 45
        for conveniently turning the rod to raise or lower the modulator
        33 relative to the throat 35 and thus increase or decrease the
        area of the annular orifice. </p>
      <p>Another embodiment of the mixing and modulating device B of the
        present invention is illustrated in FIGS. 6-8. In general this
        device B indicated generally at 50 is similar to the device A
        illustrated in FIGS. 3-5 and like reference numerals have been
        used to indicate the duct 31, the cover 37, the tangential
        intake passage 36 and the fuel nozzle 40. It will be noted,
        however, that the converging portion 52 and the modulator 53 of
        this embodiment follow the schematic arrangement shown in FIG.
        2B rather than that shown in FIG. 2A. In other words, the throat
        or point of maximum constriction, in the form of an annular
        orifice 54 defined between the converging portion 52 and
        modulator 53 is not at a fixed location as in the FIG. 3
        embodiment, but rather is located in a movable plane
        (represented by the section line 8--8 in FIG. 6) which passes
        through the widest portion of the tapered lower end of the
        modulator 53. </p>
      <p>It will also be noted that the mixing and modulating device 50
        shown in FIGS. 6-8 employs a different means for raising and
        lowering the modulator 53 in the throat 54 than the device 30
        shown in FIG. 3. Here, the raising and lowering means is in the
        form of a crank arm 55 from which the modulator 53 is suspended
        by a link 56. The crank arm 55 is carried on a cross shaft 57
        projecting through the duct 31 and another crank arm 58 at one
        end of the cross shaft is provided for regulating the movement
        of the modulator 53. This arrangement not only permits more
        convenient control of the movement of the modulator 53, but
        also, permits the modulator position control linkage to be
        coupled to the fuel control valve (not shown) in order to
        coordinate the quantities of both liquid fuel and intake air
        introduced into the engine. </p>
      <p>A liquid fuel and intake air mixing and modulating device B of
        the type illustrated in FIGS. 6-8 was also tested on the 1963
        Rambler automobile discussed above. The results of these tests,
        which again represent the averages of several samples, are
        presented below in Table II. </p>

      <p>Since the speeds at which the car was tested when equipped with

        6-8 were not the same as the tests of the A type device 30
        illustrated in FIGS. 3-5, a direct comparison of the results
        cannot be made. However, it will be observed that, in general
        the exhaust emissions for the engine with the B type device 50
        were even lower than the ones with the A type device 30. </p>
      <p>As a further test of the B type device 50, it was compared with
        the Rambler when equipped with its regular carburetor at 35 mph.
        and with the dynamometer adjusted to apply approximately 20 road
        horsepower at the rear wheels of the car to simulate a power
        run. The results of this test are presented in Table III which
        further illustrates the significant reductions in undesirable
        exhaust emissions with the use of the present invention. </p>

      <p>The reason that the liquid fuel and intake air mixing and
        modulating device of the present invention produces such
        significant reductions in the undesirable exhaust emissions is
        due primarily to two correlated factors, namely, the nature and
        the uniformity of the entrained fuel and intake air mixture
        produced by the device. First, by finely dividing, throughly
        mixing and substantially completely entraining the liquid fuel
        in the intake air, an essentially uniform air-fuel mixture is
        delivered to each cylinder on every cycle. The nature and
        uniformity of this air-fuel mixture greatly reduces the cylinder
        to cylinder and cycle to cycle variations that tend to produce
        misfires and incomplete combustion in conventional carburetor
        systems. As a consequence, the air-fuel mixture which may be
        utilized in the present invention is substantially leaner than
        those heretofore employed. </p>
      <p>It is, of course, well known that theoretically complete
        combustion should occur at a stoichiometric air-fuel ratio,
        namely 15.5:1. It is also well understood that in practice this
        theoretically ideal condition does not exist in the cylinders of
        a conventionally equipped engine and that as a consequence
        carburetors in the past have been set to deliver air-fuel
        mixtures richer than stoichiometric. However, at such rich
        air-fuel ratios complete combustion cannot take place and
        substantial emissions of unburned hydrocarbons and carbon
        monoxide occur. Also, because the combustion is incomplete with
        these fuel rich mixtures and because of the excess fuel in the
        engine cylinders, the final temperature of combustion is lower
        than when the fuel and air are burned at the stoichiometric
        ratio. This, in turn, tends to reduce the production of the
        oxides of nitrogen since their formation is promoted by high
        combustion temperatures. </p>
      <p>In order to decrease the production of unburned hydrocarbons
        and carbon monoxide, carburetors have recently been set to
        provide air-fuel mixtures close to or slightly greater than the
        stoichiometric ratio. While this has been effective to reduce
        hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emissions due to more complete
        combustion of the air-fuel mixture it has also increased the
        production of the oxides of nitrogen as a result of the higher
        combustion temperatures. In fact, it has been found that
        production of the oxides of nitrogen are highest at slightly
        leaner than stoichiometric air-fuel ratios. </p>
      <p>It is one important aspect of the present invention that due to
        the nature and greatly improved uniformity of the air-fuel
        mixture produced by the instant devices, the engine can be run
        on air-fuel mixtures much leaner than stoichiometric without
        misfiring which usually results from intermittently exceeding
        the lean limits of the air-fuel ratio on a cylinder to cylinder
        or cycle to cycle basis. An air-fuel ratio of 20:1 provides
        approximately 30% more oxygen for combustion than is available
        at the stoichiometric ratio. Thus, even when complete combustion
        of the fuel takes place, the exhaust gas will contain about 5%
        free oxygen. Significantly, this free oxygen, with its
        associated quota of nitrogen, has been found to be associated
        with a reduction in the peak combustion temperature and a
        reduction in the formation of the oxides of nitrogen. In this
        connection, it will be recalled that one of the exhaust emission
        control measures in current use today involves injecting free
        air into the exhaust manifold. The present invention, however,
        differs from these arrangements in a very important respect.
        Here, the excess oxygen is introduced with the fuel as a result
        of using an air-fuel ratio on the order of 20:1 and, thus excess
        oxygen is present and available during the entire combustion
        process. </p>
      <p>Turning now to the second important factor of the invention,
        i.e., the nature of the air-fuel mixture, it is believed that it
        plays an equal, if not greater, role in the reduction of
        undesirable exhaust emissions from engines utilizing the present
        devices. </p>
      <p>By bringing the fuel into contact with the high velocity intake
        air passing through the constricted throat of the mixing and
        modulating device, the liquid fuel is broken up into finely
        divided droplets and entrained in the intake air. It has also
        been found that vaporization of the entrained fuel in the
        manifold is to be avoided to the extent practical. This can be
        achieved by decreasing the heat supplied to the manifold by such
        methods as blocking the heat riser, using a lower temperature
        thermostat and insulating the manifold. This leads to
        significant improvements over present air-fuel induction systems
        which require a high degree of fuel vaporization in order to
        achieve reasonable results. </p>
      <p>Because in the present invention, the fuel need not be
        vaporized outside the engine cylinders, the air-fuel mixture
        delivered to the cylinders can be cooler, and is more dense for
        this reason, and also it is more dense because the finely
        divided liquid fuel displaces less volume than does vaporized
        fuel. It will be appreciated, of course, that a denser air-fuel
        charge produces more power than a less dense one. Thus, the
        power output of the engine is increased from this factor. </p>
      <p>The temperature of the air-fuel charge at the end of
        compression in the present invention is also lower than that in
        conventional engines which depend upon heating the intake air to
        vaporize the fuel. In part, the lower final compression
        temperature in the present invention is due to the lower
        temperature of the air-fuel mixture initially drawn into the
        cylinders as explained above. However, the final compression
        temperature in the present invention is further reduced by
        virtue of the use of some of the heat of compression to vaporize
        fuel within the cylinders. Moreover, since the final compression
        temperature is lower, the combustion temperature will also be
        lower in the present invention as compared to conventional
        systems. As noted above, less oxides of nitrogen are produced at
        lower combustion temperatures. </p>
      <p>The lower compression temperature also appears to have a
        bearing on the octane requirement of the fuel for a given
        engine. Since the compression temperature is lower, the air-fuel
        charge for an engine of a given compression ratio is less likely
        to self-ignite. Thus, the same fuel can be used in higher
        compression ratio engines or a lower octane fuel can be used in
        a given compression ratio engine. The latter, of course, permits
        a savings in fuel costs because the lower octane fuel is
        normally sold at a price below that of the higher octane
        "premium" fuel. </p>
      <p>The nature of the air-fuel charge of the present invention is
        also believed to result in lowering the octane requirement of
        the fuel. Apparently, this stems from a modification of the
        combustion process resulting from the air-fuel charge as formed
        by the mixing and modulating device of the present invention. It
        has been found, for example, that, in a 1963 Buick V-8 engine of
        215 cubic inch displacement having a 11:1 compression ratio, the
        present invention produces excellent results both in terms of
        power and low exhaust emissions on unleaded regular gasoline of
        about 84-86 octane rating as well as regular grade leaded
        gasoline of about 91-92 octane rating. On the other hand, this
        engine when equipped with its regular 4-barrel carburetor
        required leaded premium grade gasoline of about 98-100 octane
        rating. </p>
      <p>The results of the tests on the high compression 1963 Buick V-8
        engines comparing the regular carburetor with the type B mixing
        and modulating device 50 of the present invention are presented
        below in Table IV. Again the same test equipment and procedures
        as used with the Rambler were employed. </p>

      <p>From Table IV, it will again be seen that significant
        reductions in exhaust emissions result from the use of the
        present invention. It will also be noted from the 35 and 45 mph
        tests that mixing and modulating device of the present invention
        allows the engine to operate at significantly higher air-fuel
        ratios and with somewhat lower fuel consumption. </p>
      <p>After noting the foregoing results, the Buick engine as
        equipped with the type B device was run at 40 mph with normal
        road load and the air-fuel ratio was further increased. These
        results are shown in Table V and further confirm the improvement
        in engine efficiency and its ability to run on unleaded gasoline
        as well as the reduction in exhaust emissions. </p>

      <p>In all of the foregoing tests, the fuel was introduced into the
        device as a spray through the nozzle 40 with approximately 40
        psi air pressure used to aspirate the fuel from the nozzle. It
        has been found, however, that it is not essential that the fuel
        be sprayed into the device. As shown below in Table VI the Buick
        engine was also tested with approximately 20 hp applied at the
        rear wheels to further explore the efficiency of the present
        invention. </p>

        conditions the B type device without air pressure at the nozzle
        reduced the production of oxides of nitrogen compared to when
        the nozzle was supplied with air pressure. </p>
      <p>This latter circumstance prompted the design of the liquid fuel
        and intake air mixing and modulating device C illustrated in
        FIGS. 9-13 of the drawings. Referring first to FIG. 11, it will
        be seen that this embodiment of the device C, indicated
        generally at 60, like the two previously described embodiments
        20 and 30, includes a throat insert 61 defining a converging
        portion 62 and a modulator element 63 between which there is
        defined a throat in the form of an annular orifice 65. As shown
        in FIG. 11 the modulator 63 is in its uppermost position in the
        insert 61 and the orifice 65 has its greatest cross-sectional
        area. </p>
      <p>The modulator 63 is provided with a lower converging end
        portion 64 which has an angle of convergence more than the angle
        of convergence of the portion 62. In the illustrated embodiment,
        the respective angles of convergence of the modulator 63 and of
        the portion 62 are 44.degree. and 28.degree.. As previously
        explained, these two elements thus define a diffuser section to
        convert a substantial portion of the kinetic energy of the high
        velocity air to static energy thus permitting sonic air velocity
        through the orifice over an extended range of intake manifold
        vacuum conditions. The throat insert 61 is also formed with a
        diverging lower end portion 66 to further extend the length of
        the diffuser section. The similarity of this arrangement with
        that schematically illustrated in FIG. 2B will also be apparent
        in view of the maximum throat constriction between the throat
        insert 61 and modulator 63 being located in a movable plane. </p>
      <p>Liquid fuel is supplied to the device 60 through a conduit 68
        connected to an annular body 69 in which the throat insert 61 is
        mounted. The body 69 is formed with an annular groove 70
        communicating with the conduit 68 (see FIGS. 9 and 10) to
        distribute the fuel around the outside of the insert 61. Above
        the groove 70, the body 69 is formed with an enlarged bore
        providing a clearance space 71 between the body 69 and the
        insert 61. The fuel flows from the groove 70 up through the
        annular clearance space 71 and over a lip 72 at the upper end of
        the throat insert 61. </p>
      <p>With the modulator in its uppermost position as shown in FIG.
        11, the fuel flowing over the lip 72 is immediately subjected to
        the high velocity intake air flowing through the constricted
        orifice 65. The high velocity air strips the liquid fuel from
        the wall and entrains it in finely divided form in the intake
        air. The velocity of the intake air is then reduced
        substantially as it passes through the diffuser section of the
        device 60 and into the intake manifold such that a substantial
        and useful portion of the finely divided fuel remains entrained
        in the intake air as it passes into the engine cylinders. </p>
      <p>To regulate the degree of restriction of the annular orifice
        65, the modulator 63 is mounted for axial movement in the throat
        insert 61. As seen in FIGS. 9-11 the modulator 63 is centered in
        the throat insert 61 by a web 75 connected to the upper end of
        the body 69. The modulator carries a ball bearing type nut 76
        which receives the threaded end of an operating rod 77. Rotation
        of the modulator 63 is prevented by a pin 78 extending
        downwardly from the web 75 into an opening in the upper portion
        of the modulator. As the rod 77 is rotated, the ball nut 76
        causes the modulator 63 to move up or down, depending on the
        direction of rotation of the rod, thus changing the
        cross-sectional area of the annular orifice 65. </p>
      <p>In the illustrated embodiment, rotation of the rod 77 is
        effected by a rack and pinion mechanism indicated generally at
        80. As seen in FIG. 9, a reciprocating control link 81 is fitted
        with a rack portion 82 at one end. The rack 82 engages a pinion
        gear 83 mounted on a shaft 84 journalled in bearing in the body
        69 of the mechanism 80. The shaft carries another gear 85 that
        meshes with a gear 86 on another shaft 87. Another gear 88 on
        shaft 87 in turn meshes with a gear 89 on a shaft 90 the lower
        end of which carries a sprocket 91 (see FIG. 12). The lower end
        of the control rod 77 also carries a sprocket 92 which is
        coupled to the sprocket 91 by a suitable chain 93 (see FIG. 13).
        As the control link 81 is moved to the right in FIG. 9, the
        modulator 63 is moved down as seen in FIG. 11 and vice versa.
        The maximum upper and lower positions of the modulator are
        adjustably fixed by means of pins 95 and 96 on the link which
        abut set screws 97 and 98 on the framework 99 of the device 60.
      </p>
      <p>Control of the fuel admitted to the device 60 is also
        coordinated with the constriction in the throat insert 61 by the
        modulator 63. To this end, the fuel is supplied under pressure
        by a pump 130 (FIG. 16) to a fuel regulating valve 100
        connecting the supply line 68 to the body 69 of the device. The
        valve 100 includes a metering orifice 101 and a tapered needle
        102 which regulates the flow of fuel through the orifice. The
        needle is reciprocally mounted in a packing gland 103 of valve
        100. </p>
      <p>Coordination of the valve 100 with the modulator 63 is achieved
        through a link 105 interconnecting the operating link 81 and the
        valve needle 102. The link 105 is pinned intermediate its ends
        to a block 106 which receives the threaded end 107 of the
        needle. At one end the link 105 is provided with a slot 108
        which receives a pin 109 on the control link 81 and at the other
        end the link has a slot 110 which receives a pin 111 secured in
        a block 112 reciprocally mounted in a guide channel 113 defined
        in a portion of the frame 99. As the control rod is shifted to
        the right in FIG. 9, the link 105 rotates about pin 111 and
        moves the needle valve 102 to the right, decreasing the opening
        through the metering orifice 101. </p>
      <p>To adjust the fuel flow for a given setting of the modulator,
        the threaded end 107 of the needle can be screwed in or out of
        the block 106 to decrease or increase the fuel flow through the
        orifice 101. The rate of change of fuel flow with changes in the
        position of the modulator may also be effected by changing the
        location of the pivot pin 111 about which the link 105 swings.
        This is accomplished by turning a screw 115 which is carried by
        the slide 112 and threadedly received in an end plate 116 of the
        frame 99. By changing the pivot point of the link 105 the amount
        of movement of the needle 102 is changed relative to the control
        link 81. </p>
      <p>To compensate for the vacuum in the intake manifold which tends
        to draw the modulator 63 down into the throat insert 61, the
        device 60 is provided with a vacuum feedback means. A vacuum
        port 120 is located in the base 121 of the unit and a vacuum
        line 122 connects the port to a cylinder 123. A piston 124 in
        the cylinder carries a rack 125 engageable with the gear 85. As
        the vacuum at the port 120 increases, the piston 124 moves the
        rack 125 in a direction to lift the modulator 63 and thereby
        reduces the vacuum. This permits a much lower force to be
        applied to the control link 81 to adjust the position of the
        modulator 63. </p>
      <p>The mixing and modulating device 60 illustrated in FIGS. 9-13
        has been successfully applied to the engine of a 1970 Ford
        Torino. This engine has a displacement of 351 cu. in. and a
        10.7:1 compression ratio. It includes a four-barrel carburetor
        as standard equipment and premium grade fuel is recommended. </p>
      <p>The same test equipment and procedure described above in
        connection with the Rambler and Buick engines was employed with
        the Ford engine and the results are summarized in Table VII. </p>

      <p>The results presented in Table VII again demonstrated the
        significant reduction in exhaust emissions achieved by use of
        the liquid fuel and intake air mixing and modulating device and
        method of the present invention. At the same time the octane
        requirement of the engine is substantially reduced and the fuel
        economy is improved. </p>
      <p>In order to permit simultaneous testing of additional
        automobiles on the road as well as on the dynamometer, several
        more liquid fuel and intake air mixing and modulating devices
        were built. Also, a new chassis dynamometer stand together with
        more sensitive continuous recording instrumentation was
        installed at the test facility. </p>
      <p>These additional mixing and modulating devices D are
        essentially the same as the one shown in FIGS. 9-13 except that
        the throat insert 61d and the modulator 63d were fabricated to
        function in accordance with the design schematically shown in
        FIG. 2A. In other words, the throat or point of maximum
        constriction, in the form of an annular orifice 65d defined
        between the throat insert 61d and modulator 63d, is located in a
        fixed plane, represented by section line 15--15 in FIG. 14. In
        the illustrated embodiment the angle of convergence of the
        modulator is 30.degree. and that for the throat insert 61d is
        100.degree. above the orifice 65d and 10.degree. below the
        orifice. Thus, it will be seen that the throat insert 61d and
        the modulator 63d cooperate to form a diffuser section of
        gradually increasing cross-sectional area downstream of the
        throat. </p>
      <p>One of these mixing and modulating devices D with a 1.92 inch
        diameter throat was installed on a 1970 Dodge automobile with a
        318 cubic inch displacement engine having an 8.8:1 compression
        ratio. The improvement in exhaust emissions of this combination,
        and its ability to tolerate low octane unleaded fuel and even
        kerosene, as compared to the engine equipped with its standard
        carburetor is shown in Table VIII. </p>

      <p>Similar results were also obtained with one of the mixing and

        installed on a 1970 Chevrolet having a 350 cubic inch V-8 engine
        with a 10.25:1 compression ratio. As originally equipped, this
        engine has a four-barrel carburetor and requires premium grade
        fuel. A comparison of the exhaust emissions produced by this
        engine with its normal carburetor and with the mixing and
        modulating device D of the present invention is presented in
        Table IX. </p>

      </p>
      <p>Again, the liquid fuel and intake air mixing and modulating
        device D of the present invention produced a substantial
        reduction in exhaust emissions and also permitted operation of
        the engine on lead-free regular grade gasoline. </p>
      <p>It should be appreciated that the data presented in Tables 1-X
        was obtained during substantially steady state conditions.
        However, the liquid fuel and intake air mixing and modulating
        device of the present invention has also been found to provide
        substantial reductions in exhaust pollutants when operated
        pursuant to the current seven-mode cycle test. (See Fed. Reg.
        Vol. 33, No. 108, June 4, 1968) Basically, this test requires
        closely controlled operation of the engine on the dynamometer at
        certain specified speeds during specified time intervals. The
        exhaust emissions produced during the seven-mode cycle are then
        computed according to a weighted formula. Although the
        seven-mode cycle tests prescribed by the Federal Regulations
        require a cold start after at least a 12 hour waiting period,
        the test results presented hereinafter are "Hot Cycles"
        conducted without the engine returning to ambient temperature.
        In all of the seven-mode cycle tests reported herein, the heat
        cross-over in the intake manifold was blocked to reduce the
        intake manifold temperature. </p>
      <p>One of the liquid fuel and intake air mixing and modulating
        devices D having a throat and modulator as shown in FIGS. 14 and
        15 was installed on the 1970 Chevrolet engine mentioned above
        and was operated pursuant to the foregoing seven-mode hot cycle
        test. Before presenting the results of these tests, it should be
        noted that changes in ignition timing of this engine (as well as
        most others) has a significant influence on the emission results
        under the seven-mode cycle test. As normally equipped, this
        engine has a transmission controlled vacuum actuated advance
        mechanism coupled to the distributor (spark ignition device)
        which advances the ignition timing up to 35.degree.-40.degree.
        before top dead center (BTDC) of the pistons at cruising
        conditions in high gear. When the vacuum advance mechanism is
        deactivated, the ignition timing is varied with engine speed by
        a centrifugal advance mechanism between 4.degree. BTDC at idle
        and 20.degree. BTDC at 50 mph. As shown in Table XI deactivating
        the vacuum advance mechanism results in cutting the HC and
        NO.sub.x emissions approximately in half during the seven-mode
        hot cycle tests when the engine is equipped with its standard
        four barrel carburetor. </p>

      <p>Substantial improvements in the above results were achieved
        when the Chevrolet engine was equipped with a mixing and
        modulating device D of the type shown in FIGS. 14 and 15 as may
        be seen in Table XII. </p>

      <p>It was noted during both road testing and dynamometer testing
        of the 1970 Chevrolet with the mixing and modulating device of
        the present invention that it was quite sensitive to changes in
        engine temperature and intake manifold vacuum conditions. In
        order to compensate for these changing conditions and to achieve
        the results of the seven-mode cycle tests presented above, a
        more elaborate fuel control system than had been used on the
        foregoing steady state tests was adopted. One fuel control
        system, which is illustrative only, is shown schematically in
        FIG. 16. </p>
      <p>When the ignition switch 129 is turned on, fuel is drawn from
        the fuel tank by an electric fuel pump 130 set to produce a
        pressure of 6.5 psi in a supply line 131. The fuel passes
        through a filter 132 connected between the supply line 131 and a
        fuel feed line 133. A return line 134 is also connected to the
        filter 132 through a restriction 135 such that fuel in excess of
        engine demand is constantly filtered and returned to the fuel
        tank. </p>
      <p>From the feed line 133, the fuel is directed to the needle
        valve 100 through parallel branch lines 136 and 137. Branch line
        136 includes a constant pressure regulator 138 set at 4.5 psi
        and a metering valve 139 controlled by engine manifold vacuum by
        a diaphragm actuator 140. Excess fuel delivered to the metering
        valve is returned to the fuel tank through return line 141. </p>
      <p>Branch line 137 includes three constant pressure regulators
        142-144 connected in series and set at 2.5 psi, 2.0 psi and 1.5
        psi, respectively. Connected between regulators 142 and 143 and
        the downstream end of branch line 137 is a bypass line 145
        having a solenoid valve 146. Another bypass line 147 with a
        solenoid valve 148 is connected between regulators 143 and 144
        and the downstream end of branch line 137. A temperature switch
        149 and a pressure switch 150 are connected in parallel to
        solenoid 146 and a temperature switch 151 and pressure switch
        152 are connected in parallel to solenoid valve 148. </p>
      <p>The temperature switches 149 and 151 are disposed to sense
        cooling water in the engine jacket and are set to open at
        85.degree. F. and 90.degree. F., respectively. The pressure
        switches 150 and 152 sense manifold vacuum and are set to open
        at 9 inches and 10 inches of mercury vacuum, respectively. An
        oil pressure switch 153 set to remain open until oil pressure is
        detected is connected in series between ground and each of the
        switches 149-152. A source of electrical potential, such as a 12
        volt battery is connected to the other end of the coil of each
        of the solenoid valves 146 and 148 to complete the respective
        electrical circuits. </p>
      <p>Another bypass line 155 is connected between pressure regulator
        138 and a point in the delivery line 68 between the needle valve
        100 and the mixing and modulating unit 60. The by-pass 155
        includes a pressure accumulator 157 and a pair of spring loaded
        check valves 158 and 159, one on either side of the accumulator.
      </p>
      <p>The primary path of fuel flow to the unit 60 is through branch
        line 137 and pressure regulators 142-144 which deliver fuel to
        the needle valve 100. During initial operation, when the engine
        is cold, additional fuel is supplied to the needle valve 100
        through bypass line 145 until the engine water temperature
        reaches 85.degree. F. and then through bypass line 147 until the
        water temperature reaches 90.degree. F. Thereafter primary fuel
        is delivered through branch line 137, passing through all three
        pressure regulators 142-144. </p>
      <p>As the throttle linkage is moved to open the throat of the
        modulator 60, a small quantity of supplementary fuel is also
        delivered to the modulator 60 from the accumulator 157. Check
        valve 158 is set to open at approximately 4 psi to supply the
        accumulator, which is in the form of a small piston and cylinder
        combination, from branch line 136. The other check valve 159 is
        set to open at approximately 6 psi so that there is no flow
        through the accumulator until its piston is advanced by the
        throttle linkage increasing the pressure within the accumulator
        to above 6 psi. </p>
      <p>In the illustrated fuel control system, additional fuel is also
        supplied to the unit 60 through bypass lines 145 and 147 when
        the engine is under load and the manifold vacuum drops below 9
        and 10 inches Hg., respectively. Progressively more fuel is then
        supplied through branch line 136 and metering valve 139 when the
        manifold vacuum drops below 9 inches Hg. It should be
        appreciated, of course, that the foregoing temperature and
        pressure conditions are only exemplary and that various other
        changes and modifications can be made in the fuel control system
        without departing from the present invention. </p>
      <p>As previously mentioned herein, the liquid fuel is supplied to
        the mixing and modulating device of the present invention in a
        fuel delivery zone at or before the point of maximum
        constriction defined between the throat insert and the
        modulator. This insures that the liquid fuel is subjected to and
        finely divided by the shearing action of the high velocity air
        flow which increases to sonic at the throat zone and supersonic
        just downstream of the throat in the diffuser. Shortly
        thereafter, the intake air and entrained fuel droplets pass
        through a sonic shock front or zone in the diffuser and the air
        abruptly decreases in velocity and the fuel droplets which
        continue at high velocity relative to the air are then subjected
        to additional shearing action. </p>
      <p>A series of experiments have been conducted to investigate the
        results of introducing the liquid fuel at various points above
        and below the maximum throat constriction. The throat insert of
        one of the mixing and modulating devices of the present
        invention as shown in FIG. 14 was modified as shown in FIG. 17
        to provide an annular fuel feed slot 170 approximately 3/4 inch
        below the maximum throat constriction indicated by dash-line
        171. This unit was installed on the same 1970 Chevrolet,
        previously referred to, and tested on the chassis dynamometer in
        accordance with the same test procedures mentioned above. The
        results of these tests indicated that the car was operable only
        at speeds in excess of 55 mph when the fuel slot 170 is located
        3/4 inch below the maximum throat constriction. </p>
      <p>At speeds less than 55 mph, the liquid fuel is not broken up
        into fine droplets and entrained in the intake air. Rather, the
        fuel apparently enters the manifold in sporadic streams or slugs
        and the car is not operable. At speeds in excess of 55 mph, the
        car would run; however, adjustment of the car for minimum
        exhaust emissions was extremely difficult, the fuel valve was
        extremely sensitive, and the fuel pressure had to be reduced to
        a very low level to achieve control over the emissions. This is
        believed to be at least partially due to the fact that the fuel
        feed slot 170 is subjected directly to manifold vacuum
        conditions when it is located below the throat constriction. The
        emission results are shown below in Table XIII. </p>
      <p>Another test was then conducted with the fuel feed slot 172
        located 0.1 inch below the maximum throat constriction.
        Operation of the car was better and the fuel needle response
        improved. However, the car still would not operate below 50 mph.
        The emission results of this test are also presented in Table
        XIII. </p>
      <p>A similar test was conducted with the fuel feed slot 173
        located 0.1 inch above the maximum throat constriction. The car
        now operated at all speeds, but with some difficulty at slower
        speeds due to the vacuum effect on the fuel slot which caused
        variation in fuel flow and insensitive needle response. The
        emission results are presented in Table XIII. </p>
      <p>The same experiment was repeated with the fuel feed slot 174
        located 0.25 inches above the maximum throat constriction. This
        permitted operation with higher fuel pressure and better
        response of the needle but the fuel feed slot was still being
        affected somewhat by the vacuum due to the close proximity to

      <p>It has been previously noted herein that the intake air flowing
        through the mixing and modulating device of the present
        invention is accelerated to sonic velocity at the maximum throat
        constriction and that with an efficient diffuser section, the
        air flow reaches supersonic velocity just inside the diffuser
        and then abruptly decreases in velocity as it passes through a
        sonic shock front. This was confirmed during the course of the
        experiments mentioned above in connection with the location of
        the fuel feed slot. A fine gauge hypodermic needle coupled to a
        vacuum gauge was inserted axially into the annular orifice
        formed between the insert 61d and the modulator 63d during
        operation of the car on the dynamometer. The manifold vacuum was
        noted and then the needle was withdrawn in measured amounts as
        successive vacuum readings were recorded throughout the diffuser
        and throat. Typical results of these tests are graphically
        plotted in FIG. 18, where O represents the throat constriction
        and positive values are downstream of the throat and negative
        values are upstream of the throat. </p>
      <p>The solid curve in FIG. 18 illustrates the vacuum profile
        measured as the probe is withdrawn axially from the diffuser and
        the throat of the mixing and modulating device when the manifold
        vacuum is 16 inches Hg. This, of course, is above the threshold
        vacuum of 14.3 inches Hg. required to produce sonic velocity at
        the throat. Moreover, due to the gradually increasing
        cross-section of the diffuser section, the velocity of the air
        flow continues to increase above sonic velocity as indicated by
        that portion of the vacuum profile extending upwardly from the
        sonic point (14.3" Hg.) to a vacuum reading of 23.5 inches Hg.
        This sharp rise, from sonic to the supersonic peak occurs over a
        very short axial distance, only about 0.1 inch in the throat in
        this particular unit. It will be understood, however, that this
        distance can vary depending on the specific geometry of the
        device. </p>
      <p>From the supersonic peak, the air velocity then shocks down
        abruptly, also within about 0.1 inch in this particular unit, as
        indicated by the sharp drop in the vacuum profile as it returns
        to the vacuum prevailing generally in the manifold. Both the
        rapid acceleration of the air to supersonic velocity and the
        abrupt shock back down to subsonic velocity impose high shear
        forces on the larger droplets of entrained liquid fuel,
        resulting in successive push-pull forces on the heavier fuel
        particles entrained in the air. These high shear forces are
        instrumental in subdividing any larger drops of liquid fuel into
        finer droplet form. </p>
      <p>Pursuant to the present invention, the supersonic velocity
        through the mixing and modulating device and the subsequent
        shock effect in the diffuser section are maintained even at
        manifold vacuum conditions below that which would normally
        produce sonic velocity through a simple butterfly-valve-type
        throttle. This may be seen by reference to the dotted line plot
        of vacuum profile shown in FIG. 18 where the general manifold
        vacuum is 11.5 inches Hg., and also by noting that at point X a
        vacuum of 19.5 inches Hg. was obtained at a manifold vacuum of
        only 9.5 inches Hg. which is well below the 14.3 inch Hg. sonic
        point. Therefore, it is clear that even at these low manifold
        vacuum conditions the diffuser section operates to generate a
        supersonic peak velocity and subsequent shock back to below
        sonic velocity, as shown by the vacuum profiles plotted in FIG.
        18. It should be understood that the curves plotted in FIG. 18
        were obtained from a mixing and modulating device as illustrated
        in FIG. 17 during the course of the fuel feed slot experiments
        described above. In other words, these were vacuum profile plots
        obtained while the 1970 Chevrolet was being operated on the
        dynamometer. Although the hypodermic probe was very fine and
        somewhat flattened, vacuum readings below about 11 inches Hg.
        could not be reliably obtained due to surging of the engine on
        the dynamometer stand as a result of interfering with the flow
        of fuel and air through the clearance space provided by the
        annular orifice between the insert 61 and the modulator 63. </p>
      <p>In order to confirm the effect that the diffuser section of the
        mixing and modulating device illustrated in FIG. 17 had on the
        generation of high supersonic peak velocities and abrupt sonic
        shock zones as indicated in FIG. 18, a substantial portion of
        the diffuser section of the modulator 63d was cut away as
        indicated by dash lines in FIG. 17. Only a 1/16 inch section was
        left remaining at the very top of this modulator. </p>
      <p>Two vacuum profile plots axially through the throat of the
        mixing and modulating device as modified above (modulator cut
        away) are presented in FIG. 19. The solid curve was plotted at a
        manifold vacuum of 17 inches Hg. and the dotted line curve at
        13.5 inches Hg. These values are respectively above and below
        the threshold vacuum of 14.3 inches Hg. necessary to produce
        sonic velocity at the throat. Although this modification still
        resulted in the air velocity going into the supersonic range,
        the respective peak velocities were much lower than those in
        FIG. 18 and these velocities were maintained over a much greater
        distance and then quite slowly reduced to manifold conditions.
        In other words, the shear forces exerted on the fuel in both the
        push and pull directions described above were substantially
        reduced in the modified device as indicated by a comparison of
        FIGS. 18 and 19. This was confirmed by visual observation of the
        droplets produced by the modified device. Much larger droplets
        appeared to be produced by the cutaway modulator, illustrated in
        dash lines in FIG. 17, than the solid line configuration. The
        respective manifold vacuums, peak vacuums and vacuum difference
        (all in inches Hg.) for FIGS. 18 and 19 are tabulated below in
        Table XIV. </p>

      <p>Since it was clear that the abrupt shock had been lost with the
        above described modification, another throat insert and
        modulator as shown in FIG. 14 were obtained for further tests.
        First, a portion of both the throat insert and modulator in the
        diffuser section were cut away from a point beginning 1.2 inches
        below the point of maximum constriction of the throat as shown
        in the lower dash lines of FIG. 20. This had very little, if
        any, effect on the efficiency of the diffuser and a plot of the
        vacuum profile of this device appeared very similar in shape and
        magnitude to that shown in the solid line curve in FIG. 18. </p>
      <p>Subsequently, the throat insert and modulator were cut away
        beginning at a point 0.3 inches below the maximum constriction
        as shown by the intermediate dash lines in FIG. 20. Two plots of
        the vacuum profile of this device are shown in FIG. 21. The
        solid curve is at 15.2 inches Hg. manifold vacuum and the dotted
        line curve at 13.5 inches Hg. vacuum. These values are also
        intermediate those in FIG. 18 and a comparison of these figures
        indicates that the respective curves are very similar in both
        shape and magnitude. Actually, both the rapid rise and fall of
        the velocity in FIG. 21, occurred over an even shorter axial
        distance than that in FIG. 18. This indicates that although the
        diffuser section was now only 0.3 inch long, a sharp supersonic
        peak velocity and subsequent abrupt shock front were still
        obtained. </p>
      <p>Next, both the insert 61 and modulator 63 were cut away
        beginning at only 0.1 inch below the point of maximum
        constriction. This resulted in partial destruction of the
        diffuser section as may be seen from the two vacuum profiles
        plotted in FIG. 22. </p>
      <p>Although the respective values of manifold vacuum plotted here
        are only slightly below those plotted in FIG. 21, it will be
        noted that the respective peaks in FIG. 22 are substantially
        lower than those in FIG. 21. Thus, the efficiency of the
        diffuser was definitely affected. The respective manifold
        vacuums, peak vacuums and vacuum difference in inches Hg. for
        FIGS. 21 and 22 are presented in Table XV. </p>

      <p>In view of the sharp velocity peaks and good shock
        characteristics as shown in FIG. 21 of the throat insert and
        modulator combination represented by the central dash line
        embodiment in FIG. 20, it was decided to run additional
        seven-mode hot cycles on the 1970 Chevrolet fitted with a type E
        device having a regular modulator 63 and a throat insert cut
        away at a 6.degree. angle from a point 0.3 inch below the
        constriction. Such a type E device is illustrated in the solid
        line embodiment of FIG. 23 and the results of these tests are
        presented below in Table XVI. </p>

      <p>It will be noted that the data presented on the first line of
        Table XVI are essentially the same as those in Table XII. This
        serves to further verify that the modified device (FIG. 23,
        solid line embodiment) with only a short diffuser section was
        still quite effective in entraining finely divided fuel droplets
        in the intake air over the various speed conditions encountered
        in the seven-mode hot cycle test. In addition, this modified
        embodiment of the liquid fuel and intake air mixing and
        modulating device of the present invention also made it possible
        to operate this high compression ratio (10.25:1) engine not only
        on low octane, unleaded gasoline but also on such gasoline free
        of butane. </p>
      <p>In view of the indicated importance of maintaining sonic
        velocity and a subsequent shock front in the mixing and
        modulating device of the present invention, an attempt was made
        to determine at what manifold vacuum level this condition would
        be lost. As previously noted, the level of manifold vacuum at
        which the device just fails to maintain sonic velocity at the
        throat is referred to herein as the unchoking point. </p>
      <p>Initially, data from the foregoing tests was collected and
        plotted for those manifold vacuum conditions for which the probe
        technique had been employed. By extrapolating these data it was
        concluded that the mixing and modulating devices C (FIG. 11) and
        E (solid line FIG. 23) had unchoke points of about 3.5 inches
        Hg. and 5.5 inches Hg., respectively. </p>
      <p>These extrapolated values were subsequently verified on bench
        test equipment and more sensitive instrumentation which became
        available for further experiments. The bench tests established
        that the mixing and modulating device C illustrated in FIG. 11
        had unchoke points ranging between 3.3 to 3.7 inches Hg.,
        respectively, at conditions simulating engine operating speeds
        from idle to 50 mph. The unchoke points for the mixing and
        modulating device D illustrated in FIG. 14 were found to range
        between 5.5 to 6.5 inches Hg., for speeds corresponding to idle
        and 50 mph, respectively. In addition, the type E device having
        a throat insert with a cut-away diffuser section together with a
        standard modulator (solid line embodiment of FIG. 23) was found
        to have similar unchoke points ranging between 5.5 to 6.5 inches
        Hg. </p>
      <p>During actual operation of the mixing and modulating device C
        (FIG. 11) as well as during the above-mentioned bench tests, the
        modulator 63 is located well below the position shown in FIG.
        11. This results in a much narrower annular orifice 65 and also
        exposes a portion of the converging duct portion 62, above the
        top of modulator 63, as a lead-in to the annular orifice 65.
        Since the angle of convergence of this throat portion is
        28.degree., the half angle or slope of each wall portion is
        14.degree. with respect to the center line. In contrast, the
        modified devices illustrated in the solid line embodiments of
        FIGS. 20 and 23 have a half angle of 50.degree. for the
        converging entrance portion leading into the fixed point of
        maximum constriction. </p>
      <p>A series of additional experiments on the above-mentioned bench
        test equipment has now established that changes in the entrance
        half angle to the throat constriction have a definite effect on
        the unchoking points of the mixing and modulating devices of the
        present invention. First, the entrance half angle of the throat
        insert shown in FIG. 14 was changed from 50.degree. to
        25.degree. as shown in the lower dash line of FIG. 23. The
        unchoke points remained about the same, i.e. 5.5 to 6.5 inches
        Hg. vacuum at 50 mph, but the performance at idle appeared
        better. Next, the entrance half angle was changed to 15.degree.
        as shown in the upper dash line of FIG. 23. This resulted in a
        significant reduction of the respective unchoke points to 3.7 to
        4.2 inches Hg. vacuum from idle to 50 mph. It will also be noted
        that those values are very close to the unchoke points of
        3.3-3.7 inches Hg. obtained for device C (FIG. 11) having an
        entrance half angle of 14.degree.. </p>
      <p>A further modification of the device shown in FIG. 23 was made
        by extending the top of the modulator as shown in dotted lines
        such that it too had an entrance half angle of about 15.degree..
        When this modulator was tested with the modified throat insert
        having an entrance half angle of 15.degree., the unchoke point
        at 50 mph was reduced from 4.2 to 3.5 inches Hg. vacuum.
        However, the unchoke point at idle increased from 317 to 5.5
        inches Hg. vacuum. Another test was then made with the extended
        modulator and the original throat insert having a 50.degree.
        half angle entrance. This resulted in unchoke points of 3.5 and
        5.5 inches Hg. vacuum, respectively, at idle and 50 mph,
        essentially the reverse of the preceding modification. It would
        appear that the optimum entrance half angle for the mixing and
        modulating device illustrated in FIG. 23 is somewhere between
        these illustrated embodiments. </p>
      <p>While the foregoing changes in the entrance half angle
        demonstrate the importance of this parameter in extending the
        range of operating conditions at which sonic velocity can be
        maintained, the importance of at least a short and efficient
        diffuser section should not be overlooked. In this connection,
        the unchoke points for the mixing and modulating device C (FIG.
        11) were lowered by 1.2 inch Hg. by cutting away a portion of
        the diffuser as shown in dash lines in FIG. 24. The respective
        unchoke points for this embodiment were 2.7 and 3.2 inches Hg.
        vacuum, respectively, for idle and 50 mph. These are the best
        results that have thus far been obtained with one of the mixing
        and modulating devices of the present invention that has also
        been suitable for installation on an automobile engine to
        produce the significant reductions in exhaust emissions
        described herein. </p>
      <p>In theory, however, it would appear that the unchoke points
        could be further extended down to perhaps as low as 1 to 2
        inches Hg. by providing an entrance half angle on the order of
        about 6.degree. together with a nearly optimized diffuser
        section. However, both of these factors would tend to increase
        the axial extent of the mixing and modulating device and also
        require a correspondingly greater amount of axial movement of
        the modulator in order to cover the full range of engine
        operating conditions as compared with the embodiments of the
        invention disclosed and described herein. Whether such a
        theoretically optimized unit could be practically fitted within
        the engine compartment of an automobile remains to be seen.
        Moreover, since engine intake vacuum rarely drops below about 5
        inches Hg., except under extremely aggressive driving
        conditions, it will be appreciated that either of the
        embodiments of the present invention illustrated in FIGS. 11 and
        14 provide for sonic velocity of the intake air over
        substantially the entire range of engine operation. Finally, as
        indicated in connection with the modifications discussed in
        connection with FIGS. 23 and 24 either of these embodiments can
        be rather easily modified to lower their unchoke points down to
        about 2.5-3.5 inches Hg. vacuum should it be deemed necessary or
        desirable to extend the range of engine operating conditions to
        this degree. </p>
      <p>The operation of the liquid fuel and intake air mixing and
        modulating device of the present invention is quite different
        than that of a conventional carburetor. First, although
        conventional carburetors employ one or more venturi sections in
        which the velocity of intake air is increased, these venturi
        sections are provided for the purpose of metering the amount of
        fuel fed into the intake air. In order to achieve this metering
        function, the venturi must operate far below the sonic velocity,
        because once sonic velocity is reached, the flow through the
        venturi is fixed and the ability of the venturi to perform its
        metering function is lost. Second, although the butterfly-valve
        throttle in a conventional carburetor does produce sonic
        velocity over a portion of the range of intake manifold vacuum
        conditions at which the engine is operated, i.e. at vacuum
        conditions above about 12 inches Hg., as its typical unchoked
        point its range is obviously quite limited. Third, such throttle
        constrictions do not produce sharp supersonic peak velocities
        and abrupt shock fronts because there is no effective diffuser
        section associated with the throttle and the throttle opening is
        asymmetric. The absence of such a diffuser section also results
        in the velocity of the intake air falling well below sonic
        velocity when the manifold vacuum drops below the unchoking
        point of about 12 inches Hg. </p>
      <p>In contrast, the liquid fuel and intake air mixing and
        modulating device of the present invention is effective to
        produce sonic velocity at the throat and supersonic velocity
        peaks and subsequent abrupt shock fronts in the diffuser section
        over substantially the entire range of engine operations
        conditions. The shearing action provided by these sharp velocity
        gradients breaks the liquid fuel into finely divided droplets so
        that a substantial and useful portion of the liquid fuel remains
        entrained in the intake air as it passes into the intake
        manifold. Due to the nature and uniformity of the resulting
        air-fuel charge, combustion is more complete over a wide range
        of air-fuel ratios and takes place at a lower temperature and
        possibly by a somewhat modified combustion process. As a result,
        undesirable exhaust emissions are substantially reduced and at
        the same time the engine is capable of operating on unleaded
        fuel having a much lower octane rating than would otherwise be
        required. </p>
      <p>While the invention has been described in connection with
        certain preferred embodiments and procedures in the foregoing
        specification, we do not intend the invention to be limited
        thereby. Rather, the invention should be construed as embracing
        such alternate and equivalent embodiments as fall within the
        scope of the appended claims. </p>

        <b>1981-07-21</b> <br>
        <b>Abstract --- </b>An apparatus for separating almost all fine
        particles, including particles less than 10 microns in diameter,
        from a gas stream, which requires the input of only a small
        amount of water and which discharges a correspondingly small
        amount of particle-water slurry. The apparatus includes a
        vertical cylindrical chamber having a relatively wide upstream
        portion that gradually narrows in a transition portion into an
        elongated throat portion. A central core member extends axially
        along the throat portion and forms an elongated annular passage.
        A high velocity gas stream containing fine particles is
        generally tangentially introduced into the wide upstream portion
        of the conduit to provide a circulatory flow. Water is
        introduced through a plurality of parts in the transition
        portion downstream therefrom, to provide a thin layer of water
        along the outer walls of the throat. The high velocity
        circulatory flow of the particle-laden gas along the annular
        throat region causes fine particles to migrate radially
        outwardly under high centrifugal forces into the water layer.
        The water-particle slurry is discharged through a slot in the
        outer wall of the lower portion of the throat region. The
        substantially particle-free gas passes through a radial diffuser
        section therebelow. </p>
