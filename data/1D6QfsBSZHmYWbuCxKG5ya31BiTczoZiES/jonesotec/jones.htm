            Vehicle</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
        </big></div>
      <br>
      ScienceDaily (Apr. 8, 2010) — NASA, U.S. Navy and university
      researchers have successfully demonstrated the first robotic
      underwater vehicle to be powered entirely by natural, renewable,
      ocean thermal energy.<br>
      <br>
      The Sounding Oceanographic Lagrangrian Observer Thermal RECharging
      (SOLO-TREC) autonomous underwater vehicle uses a novel thermal
      recharging engine powered by the natural temperature differences
      found at different ocean depths. Scalable for use on most robotic
      oceanographic vehicles, this technology breakthrough could usher
      in a new generation of autonomous underwater vehicles capable of
      virtually indefinite ocean monitoring for climate and marine
      animal studies, exploration and surveillance.<br>
      <br>
      Researchers at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif.;
      and the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, University of
      California, San Diego, completed the first three months of an
      ocean endurance test of the prototype vehicle off the coast of
      Hawaii in March.<br>
      <br>
      "People have long dreamed of a machine that produces more energy
      than it consumes and runs indefinitely," said Jack Jones, a JPL
      principal engineer and SOLO-TREC co-principal investigator. "While
      not a true perpetual motion machine, since we actually consume
      some environmental energy, the prototype system demonstrated by
      JPL and its partners can continuously monitor the ocean without a
      limit on its lifetime imposed by energy supply."<br>
      <br>
      "Most of Earth is covered by ocean, yet we know less about the
      ocean than we do about the surface of some planets," said Yi Chao,
      a JPL principal scientist and SOLO-TREC principal investigator.
      "This technology to harvest energy from the ocean will have huge
      implications for how we can measure and monitor the ocean and its
      influence on climate."<br>
      <br>
      SOLO-TREC draws upon the ocean's thermal energy as it alternately
      encounters warm surface water and colder conditions at depth. Key
      to its operation are the carefully selected waxy substances known
      as phase-change materials that are contained in 10 external tubes,
      which house enough material to allow net power generation. As the
      float surfaces and encounters warm temperatures, the material
      melts and expands; when it dives and enters cooler waters, the
      material solidifies and contracts. The expansion of the wax
      pressurizes oil stored inside the float. This oil periodically
      drives a hydraulic motor that generates electricity and recharges
      the vehicle's batteries. Energy from the rechargeable batteries
      powers the float's hydraulic system, which changes the float's
      volume (and hence buoyancy), allowing it to move vertically.<br>
      <br>
      So far, SOLO-TREC has completed more than 300 dives from the ocean
      surface to a depth of 500 meters (1,640 feet). Its thermal
      recharging engine produced about 1.7 watt-hours, or 6,100 joules,
      of energy per dive, enough electricity to operate the vehicle's
      science instruments, GPS receiver, communications device and
      buoyancy-control pump.<br>
      <br>
      The SOLO-TREC demonstration culminates five years of research and
      technology development by JPL and Scripps and is funded by the
      Office of Naval Research. JPL developed the thermal recharging
      engine, building on the buoyancy engine developed for the Slocum
      glider by Teledyne Webb Research, Falmouth, Mass. Scripps
      redesigned the SOLO profiling float and performed the integration.
      The 84-kilogram (183-pound) SOLO-TREC prototype was tested and
      deployed by the JPL/Scripps team on Nov. 30, 2009, about 161
      kilometers (100 miles) southwest of Honolulu.<br>
      <br>
      The performance of underwater robotic vehicles has traditionally
      been limited by power considerations. "Energy harvesting from the
      natural environment opens the door for a tremendous expansion in
      the use of autonomous systems for naval and civilian
      applications," said Thomas Swean, the Office of Naval Research
      program manager for SOLO-TREC. "This is particularly true for
      systems that spend most of their time submerged below the sea
      surface, where mechanisms for converting energy are not as readily
      available. The JPL/Scripps concept is unique in that its stored
      energy gets renewed naturally as the platform traverses ocean
      thermal gradients, so, in theory, the system has unlimited range
      and endurance. This is a very significant advance."<br>
      <br>
      SOLO-TREC is now in an extended mission. The JPL/Scripps team
      plans to operate SOLO-TREC for many more months, if not years.
      "The present thermal engine shows the great promise in harvesting
      ocean thermal energy," said Russ Davis, a Scripps oceanographer.
      "With further engineering refinement, SOLO-TREC has the potential
      to augment ocean monitoring currently done by the 3,200
      battery-powered Argo floats." The international Argo array,
      supported in part by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
      Administration, measures temperature, salinity and velocity across
      the world's ocean. NASA and the U.S. Navy also plan to apply this
      thermal recharging technology to the next generation of
      submersible vehicles.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Abstract</span> -- An energy
      producing device, for example a submersible vehicle for descending
      or ascending to different depths within water or ocean, is
      disclosed. The vehicle comprises a temperature-responsive material
      to which a hydraulic fluid is associated. A pressurized storage
      compartment stores the fluid as soon as the temperature-responsive
      material changes density. The storage compartment is connected
      with a hydraulic motor, and a valve allows fluid passage from the
      storage compartment to the hydraulic motor. An energy storage
      component, e.g. a battery, is connected with the hydraulic motor
      and is charged by the hydraulic motor when the hydraulic fluid
      passes through the hydraulic motor. Upon passage in the hydraulic
      motor, the fluid is stored in a further storage compartment and is
      then sent back to the area of the temperature-responsive material.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Description</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">BACKGROUND</span><br>
      <br>
      [0004] There are many thousands of ocean research buoys that
      presently bob up and down in the world's oceans, performing
      scientific research on temperature, salinity, global warming,
      ocean currents, and pollution. A graph of recent locations of
      these battery-powered buoys is shown in FIG. 1. At present, each
      buoy, which costs about $25K each, can travel between sea-level
      and about 1000 to 2000-m depths, and they are considered
      disposable after the batteries wear out, typically after some
      months of use.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] There are also many gliding submersibles for the Navy and
      for research purposes. Each of these gliding vehicles cost about
      $100K, and the batteries last a period of months before these
      vessels are also disposed after the batteries run out. A typical
      gliding path is shown in FIG. 2 and may cover depths from sea
      level to about 700-m.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] For most places in the world's temperate and tropical
      oceans, the temperature of the ocean at sea level (typically
      15.degree. C. to 30.degree. C.) is significantly warmer than the
      ocean below about 500-m depth (typically 4.degree. C. to 7.degree.
      C.). There is a need to have a floater or glider that can use the
      oceans' temperature differences to generate electricity, thus
      allowing these submersibles to last a period of many years,
      instead of just months.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] U.S. Pat. No. 5,291,847 discloses a submersible system that
      uses ocean temperature differences to supply buoyancy changes.
      This system uses a phase change material (PCM) that melts above
      10.degree. C. and freezes at temperatures below 10.degree. C. The
      expansion upon melting causes a liquid to be compressed and
      stored, so that it can be released to an external bladder to
      create positive buoyancy when desired. Conversely, when the PCM
      freezes, it contracts and can accept fluid from the external
      bladder to cause the submersible to sink.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] FIG. 3 (Jack A. Jones and Yi Chao, Novel Thermal Powered
      Technology for UUV Persistant Surveillance, Presentation to the
      ONR Joint Review of Unmanned Systems Technology Development,
      Panama City, Fla., Feb. 10, 2006, incorporated herein by reference
      in its entirety) shows an ocean thermal energy conversion (OTEC)
      system that uses hydraulic fluid from a phase change material
      (PCM) device, so that when the PCM compresses the liquid, it is
      stored in a high pressure bellows inside a pressurized nitrogen
      chamber. When electricity is desired, a valve is opened and the
      fluid pushes a piston that turns a generator to produce
      electricity.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] In particular, PCM (10) expands when melted above
      10.degree. C., thus forcing out a hydraulic fluid (20) past a
      check valve (30). The hydraulic fluid (20) is then stored in a
      bellows (40) that is pressurized (e.g., a 200 Bar pressure) by gas
      in a chamber (50) external to the bellows (40).<br>
      <br>
      [0010] When valve (60) is open, the hydraulic fluid (20) passes
      through and presses against a piston (70) that pushes geared rack
      and pinion teeth (80) against another set of gears (90) which will
      spin fast due to the gear ratio. A generator (100) is turned by
      the last gear in the gear train to produce power that charges a
      battery (110). Later, the hydraulic fluid (20) passes through
      valve (120) into a fixed volume chamber (130), thus allowing the
      piston (70) to return to its original position. When the PCM is
      cooled to below 10.degree. C., it freezes and contracts, thus
      allowing the hydraulic, fluid to pass through check valve (140)
      into the volume (150) surrounding the PCM tubes (10).<br>
      <br>
      [0011] The device of FIG. 3 proved to be too heavy, inefficient,
      complicated and expensive to fabricate. Commercially available,
      high-force, rack and pinion gears, as well as high-pressure
      pistons, as represented by (70), (80), (90), and (20) have a very
      large mass typically of over 15 kg. Furthermore, the required high
      ratio gears shown as (80), (90), and (100) typically have a very
      low efficiency of 0.5 or lower. Because the system has so many
      custom pieces that must be precisely aligned, it is both
      complicated and expensive to fabricate.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">SUMMARY</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0012] According to a first aspect, an energy producing device is
      disclosed, the device comprising: a temperature-responsive
      material adapted to undergo density changes in response to
      temperature changes; a hydraulic fluid operatively associated with
      the temperature-responsive material, the hydraulic fluid adapted
      to be controlled within the energy producing device in accordance
      with the density changes of the temperature-responsive material; a
      first pressurized storage compartment configured to store the
      hydraulic fluid upon the density change of the
      temperature-responsive material; a hydraulic motor fluidically
      connected with the first pressurized storage compartment; a first
      valve adapted to allow hydraulic fluid passage from the first
      pressurized storage compartment to the hydraulic motor; an energy
      storage component connected with the hydraulic motor, the energy
      storage component being chargeable by the hydraulic motor upon
      passage of the hydraulic fluid through the hydraulic motor thus
      obtaining conversion of hydraulic energy to electrical energy; and
      a second pressurized storage compartment configured to store the
      hydraulic fluid after passage of the hydraulic fluid in the
      hydraulic motor.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] Further embodiments of the present disclosure are provide
      in the written specification, drawings and claims of the present
      application.<br>
      <br>
      [0014] The thermal power generator according to the disclosure may
      have potential application as an Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion
      (OTEC) device. It has quite reasonable efficiencies compared to
      other OTEC devices that use the temperature differences between
      the upper warm ocean, and cooler deeper water which is pulled up
      from below. This might have niche applications in the commercial
      electric market for remote areas.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0020] In accordance with the present disclosure, a simplified
      system is provided with the use of a hydraulic motor to replace
      the piston and a generator to produce electricity.<br>
      <br>
      [0021] As shown in FIG. 4, the PCM (200) melting causes the
      hydraulic fluid (210) to be stored in a gas spring bellows (220)
      (e.g., at a pressure of 3000 psia) when the fluid is flowed past
      valve (230), see path 1. When power is desired, valve (240) is
      opened and the fluid passes through a hydraulic motor (250) (path
      2), thus eliminating all the pistons and gears of FIG. 3 above,
      and allowing a more simple, efficient and lightweight operation
      and charging of battery (255).<br>
      <br>
      [0022] The battery (255) can be used to power scientific measuring
      equipment, communications, imaging, etc. It can also be used for
      electrically-powered buoyancy control and for directional control
      equipment.<br>
      <br>
      [0023] Applicants have noted that a commercially available
      hydraulic motor can replace the complicated components represented
      by (20), (70), (80), and (90) in FIG. 3. According to one of the
      embodiments of the present disclosure, the total mass for this
      portion of the system can be reduced from over 15 kg to only about
      1 kg, and the total cost can be reduced from over $30,000 to only
      about $30, or a factor of about 1000, Furthermore, the mechanical
      efficiency can be increased from about 0.5 to about 0.9. A
      hydraulic gear motor is most suitable as a lightweight, efficient,
      and low cost motor, as shown by (250) in FIG. 4. After the fluid
      leaves the hydraulic motor (250), it is stored in a low pressure
      (e.g. 20 psia) spring bellows device (260) (sec also path 2), and
      is ultimately returned to the PCM vessel (200) when valve (270) is
      opened, see path 3. A typical high pressure for chamber (220) in
      FIG. 4 is 1000-5000 psi, and a typical low pressure chamber (260)
      in FIG. 4 is about 10-200 psi.<br>
      <br>
      [0024] Upon reading of the above description and review of the
      embodiment of FIG. 4, the person skilled in the art will
      understand that further embodiments can be contemplated with a
      different location of the valves shown in FIG. 4 and with a
      different number of valves.<br>
      <br>
      [0025] The device shown in FIG. 4 has a higher efficiency and is
      much less expensive, and easier to build.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] FIG. 5 shows a further embodiment of the present
      disclosure, where both electricity and buoyancy control are
      produced if the lower pressure fluid is vented to an external
      bladder at depth.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] In particular, as shown in FIG. 5, when the fluid (210)
      leaves the hydraulic motor (250), path 2, it is allowed to pass
      through valve (280) into an external expandable chamber or bladder
      (290) on the submersible, thus causing the submersible to rise.
      Since the bladder (250) is external to the submersible, when it
      expands, more external water is displaced. According to Archimedes
      Principle of Buoyancy, the submersible will become more buoyant
      when it displaces for external water.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] The same valve (280) is later used to move the fluid to the
      low pressure (e.g., 10 psia) gas bellows chamber (260) when
      descent of the submersible is desired. Ultimately, when the PCM
      (200) is cooled, valve (280) is again operated so that the fluid
      travels in path 4 back to the chamber (200). This operation allows
      the generation of electricity, as well as direct buoyancy change
      for the submersible.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] Accordingly, what has been shown is a phase change material
      thermal power generator. While this phase change material thermal
      power generator has been described by means of specific
      embodiments and applications thereof, it is understood that
      numerous modifications and variations could be made thereto by
      those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit and
      scope of the disclosure. It is therefore to be understood that
      within the scope of the claims, the disclosure may be practiced
      otherwise than as specifically described herein.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] In particular, the thermal power generator may be
      stationary, and be alternately cooled and heated by flowing water.
      Furthermore, the thermal power generator may create a high

        style="float: right;" class="btnY"></span> A simple heat
      cascading regenerative sorption heat pump process with rejected or
      waste heat from a higher temperature chemisorption circuit
      ("HTCC") powering a lower temperature physisorption circuit
      ("LTPC") which provides a 30% total improvement over simple
      regenerative physisorption compression heat pumps when ammonia is
      both the chemisorbate and physisorbate, and a total improvement of
      50% or more for LTPC having two pressure stages. The HTCC contains
      ammonia and a chemisorbent therefor contained in a plurality of
      canisters, a condenser-evaporator-radiator system, and a heater,
      operatively connected together. The LTPC contains ammonia and a
      physisorbent therefor contained in a plurality of compressors, a
      condenser-evaporator-radiator system, operatively connected
      together. A closed heat transfer circuit ("CHTC") is provided
      which contains a flowing heat transfer liquid ("FHTL") in thermal
      communication with each canister and each compressor for cascading
      heat from the HTCC to the LTPC. Heat is regenerated within the
      LTPC by transferring heat from one compressor to another. In one
      embodiment the regeneration is performed by another CHTC
      containing another FHTL in thermal communication with each
      compressor. In another embodiment the HTCC powers a lower
      temperature ammonia water absorption circuit ("LTAWAC") which
      contains a generator-absorber system containing the absorbent, and
      a condenser-evaporator-radiator system, operatively connected
      together. The absorbent is water or an absorbent aqueous solution.
      A CHTC is provided which contains a FHTL in thermal communication
      with the generator for cascading heat from the HTCC to the LTAWAC.
      Heat is regenerated within the LTAWAC by transferring heat from
      the generator to the absorber. The chemical composition of the
      chemisorbent is different than the chemical composition of the
      physisorbent, and the absorbent. The chemical composition of the
      FHTL is different than the chemisorbent, the physisorbent, the
      absorbent, and ammonia.<br>

      <b> BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><b><br>
      </b><b> 1. Technical Field </b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      This invention is directed towards regenerative heat pump system
      and method using a working fluid or refrigerant and an adsorbent
      material. <br>
      <br>
      <b>2. Discussion of the Invention </b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      Heat pumps using solid adsorbent beds are well known as shown by
      U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,610,148, 4,637,218 4,694,659, 5,025,635,
      5,046,319 and 5,079,928. In general since sorbents take up the
      working fluid when cooled and desorb the working fluid when
      heated, heat pumps are said to be heat driven. Often in adsorbent
      and chemisorbent heat pumps two beds of sorbents are used, one to
      adsorb the working fluid while the other bed is desorbing the
      working fluid. Alternate heating and cooling of the beds is the
      conventional procedure. When used in air conditioning, heat from
      an interior room may be used to evaporate the working fluid in an
      evaporator with heat rejection to the environment at ambient
      temperatures. <br>
      <br>
      In all of such systems the efficiency of the apparatus is measured
      by its coefficient of performance or "COP". By the term "COP" as
      used herein is meant the ratio of heating or cooling work
      performed divided by the amount of power required to do the work.
      Since cooling COP.sub.S, or COP.sub.CS, are generally lower than
      heating COP.sub.S, or COP.sub.HS, many systems are rated on their
      cooling COP.sub.S. <br>
      <br>
      U.S. Pat. No. 4,637,218 mentions cooling COP.sub.S between 1 and 2
      and heating COP.sub.S between 2 and 3. In U.S. Pat. No. 4,637,218
      a hot coolant is pumped from a hot 204.4.degree. C. sorbent
      compressor to a cooler 37.8.degree. C. sorbent compressor, while
      at the same time cold coolant is pumped from the cooler sorbent
      compressor to the hotter sorbent compressor. Both compressors
      exchange heat yielding a typical heat regeneration efficiency of
      about 80%. The remainder of the heat is supplied by a boiler at
      about 204.degree. C. <br>
      <br>
      U.S. Pat. No. 4,610,148 reports a theoretical heating COP of about
      3 and a cooling COP of about 2, and, a calculated operating
      COP.sub.H of about 2.6 and a calculated operating COP.sub.C of
      about 1.6. <br>
      <br>
      FIG. 3 of U.S. Pat. No. 4,694,659, which is concerned with a dual
      sorbent bed heat pump, shows heating and cooling COP's as a
      function of a dimensionless thermal wavelength parameter. <br>
      <br>
      Cryogenic cooler systems for sorption refrigerators using a
      sorption compressor, a heating/cooling loop and a Joule-Thomson
      expansion valve, or "J-T" valve, with methane as a refrigerant gas
      and charcoal as the adsorbent, are disclosed in articles entitled
      "High Efficiency sorption Refrigerator Design", and, "Design and
      Component Test Performance of an Efficient 4 W, 130 K Sorption
      Refrigerator" in Advances In Cryogenic Engineering, Vol. 35,
      Plenum Press, New York, 1990. Desorption occurs at 4.46 MPa (646
      psia), i.e. P.sub.H, and adsorption at 0.15 MPa (22 psia), i.e.
      P.sub.L, or a pressure ratio of about 30, i.e. P.sub.H /P.sub.L
      =30. Methane is expanded from 4.46 MPa to 0.15 MPa to achieve
      cooling below 130.degree. K. (-143.degree. C.). The sorbent is
      heated from 240.degree. K. (-33.degree. C.) to 600.degree. K.
      (327.degree. C.) to desorb the methane. <br>
      <br>
      U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,875,346 and 5,157,938 disclose cryogenic
      refrigeration systems in which heat is transferred by helium heat
      transfer gas from a higher temperature circuit to a lower
      temperature circuit. When heat is to be transferred, helium is
      charged to annular gas-gaps between concentric higher and lower
      temperature circuits. The helium heat transfer fluid is not
      recycled in a closed loop bt exhausted to a vacuum such as outer
      space leaving a vacuum in the gas-gaps when no heat is to be
      transferred between circuits. The working fluids used in the
      system are xenon, krypton and oxygen. <br>
      <br>
      U.S. Pat. No. 4,732,008 uses heat from a high condenser and high
      absorber of a higher temperature solution pair to heat a low
      generator of a lower temperature solution pair. <br>
      <br>
      U.S. Pat. No. 4,827,728 uses a heat exchanger for heating the
      generator of the absorption circuit with heat rejected from the
      condenser and absorber of a medium absorption circuit. <br>
      <br>
      U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,025,635 and 5,079,928 transfer heat with a heat
      transfer fluid from one chemisorbent to another chemisorbent, e.g.
      from MgBr.sub.2 to CoBr.sub.2 to CoCl.sub.2 to CaBr to SrBr.sub.2.

      system for regenerating the sensible heat of the system which
      involves a series of at least four canisters containing a lower
      temperature performing hydride and a series of at least four

      heat transfer fluid is circulated so that sensible heat is
      regenerated. <br>

      <br>
      Accordingly, there is provided by the principles of this invention
      a heat cascading regenerative sorption heat pump process with
      waste or rejected heat from a higher temperature chemisorption
      circuit powering a lower temperature physical adsorption circuit.
      The process comprises providing a higher temperature ammonia
      chemisorption circuit containing ammonia and a chemisorbent having
      a first chemical composition operable for chemisorbing and
      desorbing ammonia. The ammonia chemisorption circuit comprises a
      plurality of canisters each containing the chemisorbent, first
      condensing means, first evaporating means for cooling a low
      temperature load, first heating means for heating the chemisorbent
      to a first upper temperature for desorption of ammonia, and first
      cooling means for cooling the chemisorbent, operatively connected
      together. Each canister has a heat transfer element in thermal
      communication with, but not in fluid communication with, the
      chemisorbent therein. <br>
      <br>
      The process further comprises providing a lower temperature
      ammonia physical adsorption circuit containing ammonia and a
      physical adsorbent having a second chemical composition operable
      for physically adsorbing and desorbing ammonia, the second
      chemical composition being different than the first chemical
      composition. The ammonia physical adsorption circuit comprises
      adsorption/desorption means containing the physical adsorbent and
      having a first part for desorbing ammonia and a second part for
      adsorbing ammonia, second condensing means, second evaporating
      means for cooling a low temperature load, second heating means for
      heating the physical adsorbent in the first part of the
      adsorption/desorption means to a second upper temperature for
      desorption of ammonia, and second cooling means for rejecting heat

      and ammonia. The first closed heat transfer circuit comprising the
      heat transfer element of at least one canister, and heat exchange
      means in thermal communication with the first part of the
      adsorption/desorption means but not in fluid communication with
      the physical adsorbent. <br>
      <br>
      In the process, cooling the chemisorbent by the first cooling
      means is by flowing the first heat transfer liquid through the
      heat transfer element of the at least one canister thereby cooling
      it and the chemisorbent therein. In this process, heating the
      first part of the adsorption/desorption means and the physical
      adsorbent therein by the second heating means to a second upper
      temperature for desorption of ammonia is by flowing the first heat
      transfer liquid from the at least one canister through the heat
      exchange means thereby heating the first part, and thereby
      cascading heat from the higher temperature ammonia chemisorption
      circuit to the lower temperature ammonia physical adsorption
      circuit. The process further includes regenerating heat within the
      adsorption/desorption means by transferring heat from the first
      part thereof to the second part thereof. <br>
      <br>
      In one embodiment, the first heating means for heating the
      chemisorbent to a first upper temperature for desorption of
      ammonia provides the entire net heat added to the process. <br>
      <br>
      In another embodiment, rejecting heat from the lower temperature
      ammonia physical adsorption circuit is by transferring heat from
      the second part of the adsorption/desorption means to a third low
      temperature heat sink, thereby cooling the second part. <br>
      <br>
      In one embodiment the chemisorbent is selected from the group
      consisting of MgCl.sub.2, CaBr.sub.2, SrBr.sub.2, CoBr.sub.2, and
      solid inorganic ammoniated complex compounds. In another
      embodiment, the chemisorbent is a solid inorganic complex compound
      selected from the group consisting of alkaline earth metal
      chlorides, bromides and chlorate salts, metal chlorides, bromides

      condensing means, the first evaporating means is also the second
      evaporating means, and the first low temperature heat load is also
      the second low temperature heat load. <br>
      <br>
      In one embodiment, the second upper temperature is lower than the
      first lower temperature. In another embodiment, the second upper
      temperature is higher than the first lower temperature. <br>
      <br>
      In one embodiment, after flowing the first heat transfer liquid to
      the heat exchange means of the first part of the
      adsorption/desorption means, the process further comprises flowing
      the first heat transfer liquid through the heat transfer element
      of at least one other canister. <br>
      <br>
      In one embodiment, the third low temperature heat sink is the
      ambient environment. <br>
      <br>
      In another embodiment, the adsorption/desorption means is a
      plurality of physical adsorption compressors each containing the
      physical adsorbent, and the process comprises heating at least one
      compressor to a second upper temperature and desorbing ammonia
      from the physical adsorbent therein. In this embodiment, the heat
      exchange means is in thermal communication with the at least one
      compressor and the process further comprises heating the at least
      one compressor to the second upper temperature by transferring
      heat from the flowing first heat transfer liquid to the heat
      exchange means, and transferring heat from the heat exchange means
      to the at least one compressor, thereby cascading heat from the
      higher temperature ammonia chemisorption circuit to the lower
      temperature ammonia physical adsorption circuit. In a further
      embodiment, regenerating heat within the physical adsorption
      circuit is by transferring heat from the at least one compressor
      to the at least one other compressor; and cooling at least one
      compressor by transferring heat therefrom to a third low

      the heat exchange means of the at least one compressor, the
      process further comprises flowing the first heat transfer liquid

      <br>
      <br>
      In another embodiment, the process further comprising providing a

      transfer liquid, the second closed heat transfer circuit
      comprising a heat transfer element in thermal communication with
      each compressor but not in fluid communication with the physical
      adsorbent. A further embodiment comprises regenerating heat within
      the physical adsorption circuit by flowing the second heat
      transfer liquid through the heat transfer element of each
      compressor and transferring heat between the flowing second heat
      transfer liquid and the heat transfer elements. In another further
      embodiment, transferring heat from the heat exchange means to the
      at least one compressor comprises transferring heat from the heat
      exchange means to the flowing second heat transfer liquid, and
      then transferring heat from the flowing second heat transfer
      liquid to the heat transfer element of the at least one
      compressor. <br>
      <br>
      In one embodiment, the process further comprises directing the
      flowing second heat transfer liquid to and from the heat transfer
      elements of the compressors in a predetermined order so that the
      flowing second heat transfer liquid exiting from the third heat
      sink flows first to the heat transfer element of the compressor
      operating at the second lower temperature, then in series to the
      heat transfer elements of the other compressors, and then back to
      the third heat sink. <br>
      <br>
      In another embodiment, the process further comprises activating
      and deactivating the first heating means in a predetermined order,
      directing the flowing first heat transfer liquid to and from the

      first heat transfer liquid to and from the canisters in a
      predetermined order is such that the flowing first heat transfer
      liquid exiting from a canister cooling from the first upper
      temperature transfers heat indirectly to a compressor operating at
      the second upper temperature. In another embodiment, directing the
      flowing first heat transfer liquid to and from the canisters in a
      predetermined order is such that the flowing first heat transfer
      liquid exiting from a canister operating at the first lower
      temperature transfers heat indirectly to a compressor operating at
      the second upper temperature. <br>

      heat transfer liquid, the second closed heat transfer circuit
      having a heat transfer element in thermal communication with each
      compressor but not in fluid communication with the physical
      adsorbent, and the heat exchange means comprises a plurality of
      heat exchangers, the number of heat exchangers being equal to the
      number of compressors, and further comprising pairing a heat
      exchanger with each compressor. In this embodiment transferring
      heat from the flowing first heat transfer liquid to the heat
      exchange means comprises directing the flowing first heat transfer
      liquid from the canister cascading heat to the lower temperature
      ammonia chemisorption circuit, to the heat exchanger paired with
      the compressor receiving cascading heat from the higher
      temperature ammonia physical adsorption circuit, and directing the
      flowing second heat transfer liquid to the heat exchanger paired
      with the compressor receiving cascading heat thereby producing a
      heated flowing second heat transfer liquid, and thereafter flowing
      the heated second heat transfer liquid to the heat transfer
      element of the compressor receiving cascading heat. <br>
      <br>
      In a further embodiment, the process includes controlling the
      second upper temperature during desorption of the physical
      adsorbent in each compressor so that the pressure in the
      compressor during such desorption is equal to pressure in the
      canisters during desorption of the chemisorbent in the canisters.
      <br>
      <br>
      In one embodiment of this invention the heat cascading
      regenerative sorption heat pump process further comprises
      providing each canister with a heat transfer element in thermal
      communication with the chemisorbent therein but not in fluid
      communication with the chemisorbent, and providing each compressor
      with a heat transfer element in thermal communication with the
      physical adsorbent therein but not in fluid communication with the
      physical adsorbent. In this embodiment the process includes
      providing a plurality of heat exchangers, the number of which are
      equal to the number of the compressors. Each heat exchanger has a
      first section in thermal communication with the a second section.
      The process includes pairing a heat exchanger with each
      compressor. The process further comprises providing a plurality of
      first closed heat transfer circuits each containing a first heat
      transfer liquid, the number of the first closed heat transfer
      circuits being equal to the number of the canisters. Each first
      closed heat transfer circuit comprises the heat transfer element
      of one canister, the first section of at least one of the heat
      exchangers, and pumping means for flowing the first heat transfer
      liquid therein. The process also includes providing a second
      closed heat transfer circuit containing a second heat transfer
      liquid. The second closed heat transfer circuit comprises the heat
      transfer elements of the compressors, the second sections of the
      heat exchangers, and pumping means for flowing the second heat
      transfer liquid therein. The process includes flowing the first
      heat transfer liquid through the heat transfer element of at least
      one canister, and then to the first section of one heat exchanger.
      Heating the at least one compressor to the second upper
      temperature comprises transferring heat from the flowing first
      heat transfer liquid in the first section to the flowing second
      heat transfer liquid in the second section, and transferring heat
      from the flowing second heat transfer liquid to the heat transfer
      element of the compressor being heated to the second upper
      temperature. The process also includes regenerating heat within
      the physical adsorption circuit by flowing the second heat
      transfer liquid from the heat transfer element of the hottest
      compressor to the heat transfer element of another compressor,
      thereby transferring heat from the physical adsorbent in one
      compressor to the physical adsorbent in another compressor. The
      process further includes cooling the second heat transfer liquid
      by transferring heat therefrom to a third low temperature heat
      sink and flowing the cooled second heat transfer liquid to one of
      the compressors thereby cooling it. <br>
      <br>
      In one embodiment the heat transfer fluid is selected from the
      group consisting of mixtures of diphenyl and diphenyl oxide,
      ortho-dichlorobenzene, ethylene glycol, methoxypropanol, silicon
      oils, and water. Examples of such heat transfer fluids are the
      Dowtherm.TM. fluids. <br>
      <br>
      In another embodiment, the compressors have two pressure stages
      with a lower stage operating over a low to intermediate pressure
      range and a higher stage operating over an intermediate to high
      pressure range. In a further embodiment, the low temperature heat
      load being cooled by the process is a refrigerator and freezer
      combination. <br>
      <br>
      Further examples of staged regenerative sorption heat pump
      processes are described in my patent application Ser. No.
      8/113,611, filed AUG. 27, 1993, which is hereby incorporated
      herein by reference. <br>
      <br>
      There is also provided by the principles of this invention a heat
      cascading regenerative sorption heat pump process with rejected
      heat from a higher temperature chemisorption circuit powering a
      lower temperature water absorption circuit. The process comprises
      providing a higher temperature ammonia chemisorption circuit
      containing ammonia and a chemisorbent, the chemisorbent having a
      first chemical composition operable for chemisorbing and desorbing
      ammonia. All of the higher temperature ammonia chemisorption
      circuit described above with the lower temperature physical
      adsorption circuit can also be used in this embodiment. <br>
      <br>
      The process further comprises providing a lower temperature
      ammonia water absorption circuit containing ammonia and an
      absorbent selected from the group consisting of water and
      absorbent aqueous solutions operable for absorbing and desorbing
      ammonia. The absorbent having a second chemical composition
      operable for physically absorbing and desorbing ammonia, the
      second chemical composition being different than the first
      chemical composition. The lower temperature ammonia water
      absorption circuit comprises absorption/desorption means
      containing the absorbent and having a first part for desorbing
      ammonia and a second part for absorbing ammonia, second condensing
      means, second evaporating means for cooling a low temperature
      load, second heating means for heating the first part of the
      absorption/desorption means and the absorbent therein to a second
      upper temperature for desorption of ammonia, and second cooling
      means for rejecting heat therefrom, operatively connected
      together. <br>
      <br>
      The process also comprises providing at least one first closed
      heat transfer circuit containing a first heat transfer liquid, the
      first heat transfer liquid being different than the chemisorbent,
      the absorbent and ammonia, the first closed heat transfer circuit
      comprising the heat transfer element of at least one canister, and
      heat exchange means in thermal communication with the first part
      of the absorption/desorption means but not in fluid communication
      with the absorbent. <br>
      <br>
      In the process cooling the chemisorbent by the first cooling means
      is by flowing the first heat transfer liquid through the heat
      transfer element of the at least one canister thereby cooling it
      and the chemisorbent therein. In this process, heating the first
      part of the absorption/desorption means and the absorbent therein
      by the second heating means to a second upper temperature for
      desorption of ammonia is by flowing the first heat transfer liquid
      from the at least one canister through the heat exchange means
      thereby heating the first part, and thereby cascading heat from
      the higher temperature ammonia chemisorption circuit to the lower
      temperature ammonia water absorption circuit. The process further
      includes regenerating heat within the absorption/desorption means
      by transferring heat from the first part thereof to the second
      part thereof. <br>
      <br>
      In one embodiment, the first heating means for heating the
      chemisorbent to a first upper temperature for desorption of
      ammonia provides the entire net heat added to the process. <br>
      <br>
      In another embodiment, rejecting heat from the lower temperature
      ammonia water absorption circuit is by transferring heat from the
      second part of the absorption/desorption means to a third low
      temperature heat sink, thereby cooling the second part. <br>
      <br>
      In one embodiment, the chemisorbent is selected from the group
      consisting of MgCl.sub.2, CaBr.sub.2, SrBr.sub.2, CoBr.sub.2, and
      solid inorganic ammoniated complex compounds. <br>
      <br>
      In another embodiment, the absorbent for the lower temperature
      circuit is water. <br>
      <br>
      In one embodiment, the first part of the absorption/desorption
      means is a generator for separating a strong aqueous ammonia
      solution into a gaseous ammonia stream and a weak aqueous ammonia
      solution stream, and the second part of the absorption/desorption
      means is an absorber for absorbing a gaseous ammonia stream in the
      weak aqueous ammonia solution stream. In a further embodiment, the
      ammonia water absorption circuit containing ammonia is an AHE
      circuit, and in another embodiment it is an GAX circuit. <br>
      <br>
      In another embodiment, the second upper temperature is lower than
      the first lower temperature. <br>
      <br>
      In one embodiment the heat transfer fluid is selected from the
      group consisting of mixtures of diphenyl and diphenyl oxide,
      ortho-dichlorobenzene, ethylene glycol, methoxypropanol, silicon
      oils, and water. Examples of such heat transfer fluids are the
      Dowtherm.RTM. fluids. <br>

      </b><b> DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b>With reference to the drawings, like characters are
      employed to designate like parts. With particular reference first
      to FIG. 1, a schematic flow diagram is shown, generally designated
      by numeral 20, of the heat transfer fluid circuit of one
      embodiment of this invention for a heat cascading regenerative
      sorption heat pump system. In this embodiment waste heat from a
      higher temperature ammonia chemisorption circuit 22 is used to
      power a lower temperature ammonia physisorption circuit 23. <br>
      <br>
      As shown in FIG. 1, the higher temperature chemisorption heat
      transfer fluid circuit 22 comprises two canisters 24A and 24B,
      check valves 25A, 25B, 25C and 25D, manifolds 27 and 28, the
      chemisorption sides of heat exchangers 29A, 29B, 29C and 29D,
      solenoid valves 30A, 30B, 30C and 30D (i.e. valve set 30), and
      external heat source 32. <br>
      <br>
      Chemisorption canisters 24A and 24B, contain heat transfer
      elements 33A and 33B, respectively, surrounded by chemisorbents
      34A and 34B for ammonia. One end of heat transfer element 33A is
      connected to lines containing check valves 25A and 25B, which are
      connected to the inlet of manifold 27, and the outlet of manifold
      28, respectively. One end of heat transfer element 33B is
      connected to lines containing check valves 25C and 25D, which are
      connected to the inlet of manifold 27 and the outlet of manifold
      28, respectively. The outlets of manifold 27 are connected to the
      chemisorption side of heat exchangers 29A, 29B, 29C and 29D, which
      are connected to solenoid valves 30A, 30B, 30C and 30D,
      respectively, which are connected to inlets of manifold 28. The
      other ends of heat transfer elements 33A and 33B are connected to
      reversible pump 35, by lines 37A and 37B. A first heat transfer
      fluid is pumped through heat transfer elements 33A and 33B, and
      the chemisorption side of heat exchanger 29A, 29B 29C and 29D by
      pump 35. <br>
      <br>
      External heat source 32 comprises vessel 38 containing bath heat
      transfer medium 39 and heating unit 40. Heating unit 40 heats bath
      medium 39 which in turn heats the first heat transfer fluid as it
      is being pumped through lines 37A and 37B. Heating means 40 can be
      gas or oil heat or any other heat source desired. <br>
      <br>
      The lower temperature physisorption heat transfer fluid circuit 23
      comprises pump 42, manifold 43, solenoid valves 44A 44B, 44C and
      44D (i.e. valve set 44), the physisorption side of heat exchangers
      29A, 29B, 29C and 29D physisorption compressors 45A, 45B, 45C and
      45D, check valves 46A, 46B, 46C and 46D, solenoid valves 47A 47B,
      47C and 47D (i.e. valve set 47), manifold 48 and radiator 51. <br>
      <br>
      Physisorption compressors 45A 45B, 45C and 45D, contain heat
      transfer elements 49A, 49B, 49C and 49D respectively, surrounded
      by physisorbent 50A, 50B, 50C and 50D, respectively for ammonia. <br>
      <br>
      The outlet of pump 42 is connected to the inlet of manifold 43.
      The outlets of manifold 43 are connected to solenoid valves 44A,
      44B, 44C and 44D, which are connected to the physisorption side of
      heat exchangers 29A, 29B, 29C and 29D, respectively, which are
      connected to one of the ends of heat transfer elements 49A, 49B,
      49C and 49D, respectively. The other ends of heat transfer
      elements 49A, 49B, 49C and 49D are connected to lines containing
      check valves 46A, 46B, 46C and 46D, and also to lines containing
      solenoid valves 47A, 47B, 47C and 47D. Solenoid valves 47A, 47B,
      47C and 47D are connected to the inlets of manifold 48. The outlet
      of manifold 48 is connected to radiator 51 which is connected to
      the inlet of pump 42. <br>
      <br>
      The outlet of check valves 46A, 46B, 46C and 46D are also
      connected to the physisorption side of heat exchangers 29A, 29B,
      29C and 29D, respectively. <br>
      <br>
      A second heat transfer fluid is pumped through the physisorption
      side of heat exchangers 29A, 29B, 29C and 29D, heat transfer
      elements 49A, 49B, 49C and 49D, and radiator 51, by pump 42. <br>
      <br>
      Heat from the first heat transfer fluid in higher temperature
      chemisorption side of heat exchangers 29A, 29B, 29C and 29D heats
      the second heat transfer fluid as it is being pumped in
      counter-current flow through the physisorption side thereof, which
      in turn heats the physisorption compressors 45A, 45B, 45C and 45D.
      <br>
      <br>
      Briefly stated, and understood by one skilled in the art, in
      operation, heated heat transfer fluid is directed by pump 35 to
      one of heat transfer elements 33A and 33B, then through one of
      heat exchangers 29A, 29B, 29C and 29D as a result a corresponding
      one of solenoid valves 30A, 30B, 30C and 30D being open while the
      remaining valves of valve set 30 are closed, and then through the
      remaining heat transfer elements. <br>
      <br>
      In a similar manner, another heated heat transfer fluid flows
      through one of heat exchangers 29A, 29B, 29C and 29D, as a result
      one of solenoid valves 44A, 44B, 44C and 44D being open while the
      remaining valves of valve set 44 are closed, then through a
      corresponding one of heat transfer elements 49A, 49B, 49C and 49D,
      and then serially through the remaining heat transfer elements as
      a result of one of solenoid valves 47A, 47B, 47C and 47D being
      open while the remaining valves of valve set 47 are closed, before
      flowing through radiator 51 and back to pump 42. Radiator 51
      rejects heat to a low temperature heat sink such as the
      environment, as indicated by arrow 52. <br>
      <br>
      For example, if valve 30A is open, valves 44D and 47D will also be
      open and all other solenoid valves closed thereby causing, in
      series order from pump 42, to compressor 45C which is the coolest,
      to compressor 45B which is being cooled, to compressor 45A which
      is the hottest, to compressor 45D which is being heated, and then
      to radiator 51. <br>
      <br>
      Referring to FIG. 1, solenoid valves 30A, 30B, 30C, 30D, 44A, 44B,
      44C and 44D, 47A, 47B, 47C and 47D, are controlled by controller
      means 41 so that only one of valve set 30, only one of valve set
      44, and only one of valve set 47, are open for a predetermined
      period of time during the base part and extended or bottoming part
      of each phase. Controller means 41 also controls reversible pump
      35 so that the heat transfer fluid pumped therein flows in a first
      direction for a predetermined period of time, stops pumping for a
      predetermined period of time, or pumps in a reverse direction for
      a predetermined period of time. Controller means 41 further
      prevents heat cascading during the extended or bottoming part of
      any phase by stopping pump 35, and pumping the heat transfer fluid
      directly from pump 42 to a predetermined compressor and therefrom
      directly to radiator 51. Controller means 41 also controls
      external heating unit 40 so that heating of heat transfer medium
      39 occurs only as need to maintain its temperature to a
      predetermined value. <br>
      <br>
      A schematic flow diagram for the working fluid or ammonia circuits
      that are used in conjunction with the heat transfer circuit of
      FIG. 1, is shown in FIG. 2, comprises higher temperature
      chemisorbent ammonia circuit 55 and lower temperature physisorbent
      ammonia circuit 56. Ammonia circuit 55 comprises chemisorbents 24A
      and 24B, check valves 58A and 58B, condenser 59, Joule-Thomson
      expansion means 60, evaporator means 62 containing a charge of
      liquid ammonia 61, check valves 63A and 63B, and preferably vapor
      regenerators 64A and 64B, and auxiliary heat exchanger 65. Briefly
      stated, and understood by one skilled in the art, in operation
      desorbed high temperature, high pressure ammonia from one of
      canisters 24A and 24B, flows through vapor regenerators 64A and
      64B, through check valves 58A and 58B to condenser 59. Heat is
      rejected from condenser 59 to a low temperature heat sink such as
      the environment, as indicated by arrow 53, and the liquid ammonia
      is condensed to form a low temperature, high pressure liquid. The
      ammonia liquid is further cooled in auxiliary heat exchanger 65
      and then expanded through Joule-Thomson valve 60 to form a low
      temperature, low pressure liquid, which is collected in evaporator
      means 62. A low temperature heat load, as indicated by arrow 54,
      vaporizes the liquid ammonia 61 to form a low temperature, low
      pressure ammonia gas. The low temperature, low pressure ammonia
      gas flows through one of check valves 63A and 63B into one of
      canisters 24A and 24B. <br>
      <br>
      Similarly ammonia circuit 56 comprises physisorbents 50A, 50B, 50C
      and 50D, check valves 66A, 66B, 66C and 66D, condenser 67,
      Joule-Thomson expansion means 68, evaporator means 69 containing a
      charge of liquid ammonia 71, check valves 70A, 70B, 70C and 70D,
      and preferably vapor regenerators 72A, 72B, 72C and 72D, and
      auxiliary heat exchanger 73. Briefly stated, and understood by one
      skilled in the art, in operation desorbed high temperature, high
      pressure ammonia from one or more but not all of compressors 45A,
      45B, 45C and 45D, flows through vapor regenerators 72A, 72B, 72C
      and 72D, through check valves 66A, 66B, 66C and 66D to condenser
      67 whereupon heat is rejected from condenser 67 to a low
      temperature heat sink such as the environment, as indicated by
      arrow 74, and the gaseous ammonia is condensed to form a low
      temperature, high pressure liquid. The ammonia liquid is further
      cooled in auxiliary heat exchanger 73 and then expanded through
      Joule-Thomson valve 68 to form a low temperature, low pressure
      liquid, which is collected in evaporator means 69. A low
      temperature heat load, as indicated by arrow 75, vaporizes the
      liquid ammonia 61 to form a low temperature, low pressure ammonia
      gas. The low temperature, low pressure ammonia gas flows through
      one or more but not all of check valves 70A, 70B, 70C and 70D into
      compressors 45A, 45B, 45C and 45D. <br>
      <br>
      In all the circuits described herein the check valves open and
      close automatically whenever the pressure on the upstream side of
      the valve is greater than the pressure on the downstream side of
      the valve. <br>
      <br>
      With regard to the system shown in FIG. 2, estimated temperatures
      at various times during the cycle are listed in Table 1 along with
      indicated flow direction of the heat transfer fluid through
      reversible pump 38, the opened solenoid valve in each of valve
      sets 30, 44, and 47, and comment on the canisters and compressors
      conditions. The location of temperature points T1 to T7 are shown
      on FIG. 3. Points T1, T2, T3 and T4 are fixed, while points TS, T8
      and T7 are located proximate the compressor corresponding to the
      opened solenoid valve of valve set 30. For example, if valve 30C
      is open, temperatures T5-T7 refer to the temperature of points
      proximate to compressor 45C. In this particular embodiment,
      referring to FIGS. 1 and 2, it is assumed that the bath heat
      transfer medium is maintained at 225.degree. C., radiator 51 cools
      the heat transfer fluid to 40.degree. C., chemisorbents 34A and
      34B are MgCl.sub.2 and the canister pressure range is from 5 to 15
      bar, physisorbents 50A-D are carbon and the compressor pressure
      range is also from 5 to 15 bar, and the working fluid for both the
      higher and lower temperature circuits is ammonia. As can be seen
      from Table 1, for this embodiment, the maximum temperature reached
      in the physisorption compressors is between the maximum and
      minimum operating temperatures of the chemisorption canisters. <br>
      <br>
      FIG. 4 is a schematic flow diagram of another embodiment of the
      heat transfer fluid circuits of this invention in which solenoid
      valve sets 30, 44 and 47 of FIG. 2 are replaced with four-way
      solenoid valves 76, 77 and 78, respectively. If desired, check
      valves 25A-D can be replaced with multiple-way solenoid valve 79.
      Controller means 86 controls valves 76, 77 and 78 so that only one
      of the four inlet or outlet passages of each valve is in fluid
      communication with lines 76L, 77L and 78L, respectively.
      Controller means 86 further controls valve 79 so that heat
      transfer element 33A is in fluid communication with only one of
      lines 76L or 79L at a time, and heat transfer element 33B is in
      fluid communication with the other one of lines 76L or 79L at the
      same time. Controller means 86 opens the valves 76, 77, 78 and 79
      for a predetermined period of time. Controller means 86 also
      controls reversible pump 35 so that the heat transfer fluid pumped
      therein flows in a first direction for a predetermined period of
      time, stops pumping for a predetermined period of time, or pumps
      in a reverse direction for a predetermined period of time.
      Controller means 86 further prevents heat cascading during the
      extended or bottoming part of any phase by stopping pump 35, and
      pumping the heat transfer fluid directly from pump 42 to a
      predetermined compressor and therefrom directly to radiator 51.
      Controller means 86 also controls external heating unit 40 so that
      heating of heat transfer medium 39 occurs only as need to maintain
      its temperature to a predetermined valve. Other than as mentioned
      above the operation of the system of FIG. 4 is similar to that
      described for FIGS. 1 to 3. Higher and lower temperature ammonia
      working fluid circuits 55 and 56 of FIG. 2 can also be used with
      the heat transfer fluid circuits of FIG. 4. <br>
      <br>
      When the systems FIGS. 1 to 4 are operated, with
      ammonia-MgCl.sub.2 as the working fluid-chemisorbent pair, with
      desorption at 220.degree. C. and 15 bar, with adsorption at
      180.degree. C. and 5 bar, the chemisorbent system has a COP.sub.C
      of about 0.3; and with ammonia-carbon as the working
      fluid-physisorbent pair, with desorption at 175.degree. C. and 15
      bar, and with adsorption at 40.degree. C. and 5 bar, the
      physisorbent system has a COP.sub.C of about 1.0; with a combined
      COP.sub.C of about 1.3. <br>
      <br>
      FIG. 5 is another embodiment of the ammonia working fluid circuit
      of this invention, generally designated by numeral 80, in which
      higher temperature chemisorption circuit 22 and lower temperature
      physisorption circuit 23 share the same condenser 59,
      Joule-Thomson valve 60, evaporator means 62, ammonia source 61 and
      auxiliary heat exchanger 65. If desired, circuit 80 can be used as
      the ammonia circuit for the heat transfer circuits of FIGS. 1 and
      4. <br>
      <br>
      FIG. 6 is yet another embodiment of this invention, in which
      single stage compressors 45A-D of FIG.8 are replaced with two
      stage physisorption compressors 82A, 82B, 82C and 82D having first
      stage carbon physisorbents 83A, 83B, 83C and 83D, and second stage
      carbon physisorbents 84A, 84B, 84C and 84D, respectively,
      separated by non-permeable partition 85A, 85B, 85C and 85D,
      respectively. The operation of the heat transfer circuit of FIG. 6
      is the same as that described for FIGS. 1, 3 and 4. The operation
      of the ammonia working fluid circuit for the higher temperature
      chemisorption circuit can be the same as that described and shown
      for circuit 55 of FIG. 2, however, the operation of the ammonia
      working fluid circuit for the lower temperature physisorption
      circuit is not the same as that described and shown for circuit 56
      of FIG. 2 but rather is illustrated in FIG. 7. <br>
      <br>
      FIG. 7, shows a schematic flow diagram for the ammonia circuit of
      a two stage compression regenerative heat pump process, generally
      designated by numeral 81. For ease of illustration, only the
      ammonia working fluid circuit for the lower temperature
      physisorption circuit is shown in FIG. 7. As can be seen the
      circuit has four first stage compression zones containing carbon
      physisorbents 83A, 83B, 83C and 83D, and four second stage
      compression zones containing carbon physisorbents 84A, 84B, 84C
      and 84D. <br>
      <br>
      A quantity of ammonia 71, as the working fluid, contained in
      evaporator 69 is vaporized at a low pressure and conveyed through
      line 87. Line 87 is in heat transfer communication with line 94 in
      auxiliary heat exchanger 73. Line 87, which is connected to the
      inlet of manifold 89, the outlets of which are connected to first
      stage inlet check valves 90A, 90B, 90C and 90D, which are
      connected to vapor regenerators 91A, 91B, 91C and 91D,
      respectively, which are in fluid communication with first stage
      compression zone carbon physisorbent 83A, 83B, 83C and 83D,
      respectively. <br>
      <br>
      First stage compression zone carbon physisorbents 83A, 83B, 83C
      and 83D, and second stage compression zone carbon physisorbents
      84A, 84B, 84C and 84D, respectively, are separated by partitions
      85A, 85B, 85C and 85D, respectively, and housed in compressors
      82A, 82B, 82C and 82D, respectively. Each partition prevents
      direct fluid communication between the first stage and second
      stage compression zones within the compressor. <br>
      <br>
      Vapor regenerators 91A, 91B, 91C and 91D are also connected to
      first stage outlet check valves 92A, 92B, 92C and 92D,
      respectively, which are connected to the inlets of manifold 93,
      the outlet of which is connected to the inlet of manifold 95, the
      outlets of which are connected to second stage inlet check valves
      96A, 96B, 96C and 96D, which are connected to vapor regenerators
      97A, 97B, 97C and 97D, respectively, which are in fluid
      communication with second stage compression zone carbon
      physisorbents 84A, 84B, 84C and 84D, respectively. <br>
      <br>
      Vapor regenerators 97A, 97B, 97C and 97D are also connected to
      second stage outlet check valves 98A, 98B, 98C and 98D,
      respectively, which are connected to the inlets of manifold 99,
      the outlet of which is connected to condenser 67, which is
      connected to line 94. Line 94 is connected to expansion valve 68,
      which is connected to evaporator 69, thereby forming a closed
      ammonia working fluid loop. Solenoid valves 76, 77, 78 and 79,
      pump 35 and external heat source 40 are controlled by controller
      86 in the same manner as described for FIG. 4. <br>
      <br>
      When the system of FIGS. 6 and 7 is operated, with
      ammonia-MgC1.sub.2 as the working fluid-chemisorbent pair, with
      desorption at 220.degree. C. and 15 bar, with adsorption at
      180.degree. C. and 5 bar, the chemisorbent system has a COP.sub.C
      of about 0.3; and with ammonia-carbon as the working
      fluid-physisorbent pair in both physisorption stages, with
      desorption at 175.degree. C. and 15 bar in the second stage, and
      with adsorption at 40.degree. C. and 5 bar in the first stage, the
      physisorbent system has a COP.sub.C of about 1.2; with a combined
      COP.sub.C of about 1.5. <br>
      <br>
      FIG. 7 shows only the ammonia physisorption circuit. The ammonia
      chemisorption circuit to be used with FIG. 7 is not shown in FIG.
      7. In one embodiment, the chemisorption circuit and the
      physisorption circuit can share the same ammonia vapor recovery
      section as shown in FIG. 5 where the chemisorbent canisters and
      the physisorption compressors share the same condenser and
      evaporator means. In another embodiment the chemisorption circuit
      and the physisorption circuit can be independent as shown in FIG.
      2 where the chemisorbent canisters and the physisorption
      compressors each have their own condenser and evaporator means. <br>
      <br>
      FIG. 8 is a schematic diagram of another embodiment of this
      invention, generally designated by numeral 159, showing the
      working fluid circuit for a two stage compression series/series
      regenerative heat pump process for cooling a refrigeration space
      and a freezer space. FIG. 8 also has four first stage and four
      second stage compression zones. The working fluid circuit for the
      system of FIG. 8 is the same as that for the system of FIG. 7
      except for the addition of second evaporator circuit 160. As shown
      in FIG. 8, branching off of line 161 is line 162, which is
      connected to condenser 167, which is connected to line 164, which
      is in heat transfer communication with line 176 in auxiliary heat
      exchanger 173, which is connected to Joule-Thomson expansion valve
      168, which is connected to evaporator 169. <br>
      <br>
      Evaporator 169, which contains a supply of liquid ammonia 171,
      receives heat from a refrigerator zone, as indicated by arrow 175,
      thereby cooling the refrigerator zone. Ammonia vapor flows from
      evaporator 169 to line 176, which is connected to manifold 95,
      which delivers ammonia vapor to the second stage compression zones
      at an intermediate pressure, thereby forming a second closed
      working fluid loop. <br>
      <br>
      Evaporator means 69 receives heat from a freezer zone, as
      indicated by arrow 75, thereby cooling the freezer zone. <br>
      <br>
      The heat transfer fluid circuit for the system of FIG. 8 is the
      same as that for the system of FIG. 7, namely that shown in FIG.
      6. <br>
      <br>
      Evaporator means 89 produces ammonia gas at about -18.degree. C.
      and about 2 bar. Evaporator means 169 produces ammonia gas at
      about +5.degree. C. and about 5 bar. Condensers 74 and 174 cool
      the ammonia gas and produce a condensate at about 38.degree. C.
      and about 15 bar. <br>
      <br>
      FIG. 8 shows only the ammonia physisorption circuit. The ammonia
      chemisorption circuit to be used with FIG. 8 is not shown in FIG.
      8. In one embodiment, the chemisorption circuit and the portion of
      the ammonia vapor recovery physisorption circuit downstream of the
      upper stage physisorption compressor, i.e. line 88, and the
      upstream of the lower stage physisorption compressor, i.e. line 87
      can share the same ammonia vapor recovery section. In other words
      condenser 67 and evaporator means 69 of FIG. 8 can be deleted and
      lines 87 and 88 of FIG. 8 can be connected to lines 57B and 57A,
      respectively, of FIG. 5, and condenser 59 and evaporator means 62
      used instead. In another embodiment the ammonia vapor recovery
      circuit for the chemisorption circuit and the physisorption
      circuit can be independent as shown in FIG. 2 where the
      chemisorbent canisters have their own condenser and evaporator
      means. <br>
      <br>
      FIG. 9 is another embodiment of this invention in which heat
      transfer fluid circuit 23 of the lower temperature physisorption
      side is the same as that shown in FIG. 1, but single heat transfer
      fluid circuit 22 of FIG. 1 is replaced with two separate heat
      transfer fluid loops, generally designated collectively by numeral
      101, each having its own pump, external heat source, and four-way
      solenoid valve. In operation flow from pump 102A is directed
      through heat transfer element 33A in canister 24A to four-way
      solenoid valve 103A which directs the heat transfer fluid to
      either heat exchanger 29A or 29B, or directly back to pump 102A.
      External heat source 104A is turned on when canister 24A is to be
      heated. In a similar manner, flow from pump 102B is directed
      through heat transfer element 33B in canister 24B to four-way
      solenoid valve 103B which directs the heat transfer fluid to
      either heat exchanger 29C or 29D, or directly back to pump 102B.
      External heat source 104B is turned on when canister 24B is to be
      heated. <br>
      <br>
      Referring to FIG. 9, solenoid valves 44A, 44B, 44C and 44D, 47A,
      47B, 47C, 47D, 103A and 103B are controlled by controller means
      105 so that only one valve of valve set 44 is open, and only one
      valve of valve set 47 is open, so that inlet line 108A is in fluid
      communication with the only one of outlet lines 107A, 107B or
      107P, so that inlet line 108B is in fluid communication with the
      only one of outlet lines 107C, 107D or 107R, for a predetermined
      period of time during the base part and bottoming part of each
      phase. Controller means 105 further prevents heat cascading during
      the bottoming part of each phase by stopping pump 102A and 102B,
      and pumping the heat transfer fluid directly from pump 42 to a
      predetermined compressor and therefrom directly to radiator 51.
      Controller means 105 also controls external heat sources 104A and
      104B so that heating of heat transfer fluid in lines 108A and 108B
      occurs only as need to maintain the temperature of canisters 24A
      and 24B at a predetermined value. <br>
      <br>
      When the system of FIG. 9 is operated, with CoBr.sub.2 as the
      working fluid-chemisorbent pair, with desorption at 215.degree. C.
      and 15 bar, with adsorption at 175.degree. C. and 5 bar, the
      chemisorbent system has a COP.sub.C of about 0.35; and with
      ammonia-carbon as the working fluid-physisorbent pair, with
      desorption at 170.degree. C. and 15 bar, and with adsorption at
      40.degree. C. and 5 bar, the physisorbent system has a COP.sub.C
      of about 1.0; with a combined COP.sub.C of about 1.35. <br>
      <br>
      The operation of the heat transfer circuits for all of the above
      described embodiments illustrated in FIGS. 1 to 9 is determined by
      heat and ammonia sorption rates for the particular system in use
      and the cycling of the solenoid valves is control in a
      predetermined manner to achieve maximum efficiency for the system.
      <br>
      <br>
      FIG. 10 is a schematic flow diagram of one embodiment of this
      invention, of a heat transfer fluid circuit of a higher
      temperature chemisorption circuit, generally designated by numeral
      110, powering a lower temperature absorber heat exchange (AHE)
      system, generally designated by numeral 111. <br>
      <br>
      The heat transfer fluid circuit of higher temperature
      chemisorption circuit 110 comprises heat transfer elements 33A and
      33B, solenoid valves 148A and 148B, pump 150, external heat
      sources 152A and 152B, and controller means 154. Means 154
      controls the flow of heat transfer fluid through heat transfer
      elements 33A and 33B by opening and closing solenoid valves 148A
      and 148B for a predetermined period of time, respectively. Means
      154 also control external heat sources 152A and 152B so that only
      one is actually heating its corresponding canister (24A or 24B) at
      a time. As shown in FIG. 10, canister 24A is being heated,
      solenoid valve 148B is open and 148A closed thereby directing hot
      heat transfer fluid from canister 24B to coil 117 in generator
      115, to pump 150 and back to canister 24B. After a predetermined
      period of time the chemisorbent in canister 24A is desorbed a
      predetermined amount, external heat source 152A is turned off and
      152B turned on, valve 148B is closed and 148A opened, and the
      process repeated in a similar manner for heating canister 24B. <br>
      <br>
      In AHE system 111 ammonia-water solution 113 at about 116.degree.
      C. and 15 bar in generator 115, is heated by waste heat provided
      by higher temperature heat transfer fluid loop of chemisorption
      circuit 110, and specifically by heating coil 117. Heat from
      rectifier section 147 of generator 115 is transferred to the
      environment by radiator 118 as .indicated by arrow 120. Distilled
      and rectified high pressure ammonia vapor 119 at about 15 bar is
      removed from the generator through line 121 and charged to
      condenser 123 wherein the heat of condensation is transferred to
      the environment as indicated by arrow 124, and low temperature,
      high pressure ammonia condensate 125 at about 38.degree. C. is
      formed. The liquid ammonia is cooled further in heat exchanger
      127, expanded through Joule-Thomson valve 129, and charged to
      evaporator means 131 wherein the heat of evaporation is provided
      by low temperature heat load, such as an interior building space,
      as indicated by arrow 132, to vaporize the ammonia liquid and
      produce a low temperature, low pressure ammonia gas 133 at about
      5.degree. C. This gas is heated in heat exchanger 127 and then
      charged to absorber 139 through line 140. A stream of weak high
      pressure ammonia-water solution 113 from generator 115 is cooled
      in heat exchanger 135, expanded through Joule-Thomson valve 137,
      and charged to absorber 139 together with a stream of cooled, low
      pressure ammonia vapor conveyed by line 140 from heat exchanger
      127. The ammonia vapor stream is absorbed by the weak
      ammonia-water solution stream in absorber 139 at about 38.degree.
      C. to produce strong ammonia-water solution 141 which is collected
      in absorber 139, with the heat of absorption being exhausted to
      the environment as indicated by arrow 142. A stream of strong
      ammonia-water solution 143 is pumped by pump 144 at about 15 bar
      through heat exchanger 135 to distillation section 145 of
      generator 115 wherein ammonia is stripped from the solution at
      about 15 bar along with some water vapor. Most of the water vapor
      is separated from the ammonia vapor in rectifier section 147 with
      the separated water returning to distillation section 145 and the
      bottom section of generator 115, thereby completing the
      absorption-desorption cycle. <br>
      <br>
      When the system of FIG. 10 is operated, with SrBr.sub.2 as the
      working fluid-chemisorbent pair, with desorption at 160.degree. C.
      and 15 bar, with chemisorption at 120.degree. C. and 5 bar, the
      chemisorbent system has a COP.sub.C of about 0.35; and with AHE
      system 111 as the lower temperature circuit, with desorption in
      generator 115 at 115.degree. C. and 15 bar, and with absorption in
      absorber 139 at 38.degree. C. and 5 bar, the AHE system has a
      COP.sub.C of about 0.6; with a combined COP.sub.C of about 1.1. <br>
      <br>
      FIG. 11 is a schematic flow diagram of another embodiment of this
      invention similar in some respects to FIG. 10, of a heat transfer
      fluid circuit of a higher temperature chemisorption circuit,
      generally designated by numeral 180, powering a lower temperature
      absorber heat exchange (AHE) system, generally designated by
      numeral 111. In this embodiment, lower temperature AHE circuit 111
      is the same as that described for FIG. 10. <br>
      <br>
      The heat transfer fluid circuit of higher temperature
      chemisorption circuit 180 comprises heat transfer elements 33A and
      33B, three-way solenoid valves 182 and 184, pumps 188 and 188,
      external heat sources 190A and 190B, and controller means 192.
      Means 192 controls the flow of heat transfer fluid through heat
      transfer elements 33A and 33B by directing flow through three-way
      solenoid valves 182 and 184 for predetermined periods of time, and
      activating pumps 188 and 188. Means 192 also control external heat
      sources 190A and 190B so that only one is actually heating its
      corresponding canister (24A or 24B) at a time. <br>
      <br>
      In FIG. 11, while canister 24A is being heated by external heat
      source 190A, pumps 188 and 188 are activated, solenoid valve 182
      is open to flow only from line 193C to 193A, solenoid valve 184 is
      open to flow only from line 194B to 194C, thereby directing hot
      heat transfer fluid from canister 24B to coil 117 in generator
      115, to pump 188 and back to canister 24B. After a predetermined
      period of time the chemisorbent in canister 24A is desorbed a
      predetermined amount, external heat source 190A is turned off,
      pump 188 is deactivated, solenoid valve 182 is opened to flow only
      from line 193B to 193A, solenoid valve 184 is opened to flow only
      from line 194A to 194B, thereby directing hot heat transfer fluid
      from canister 24A to pump 188, to canister 24B and back to
      canister 24A. Heat is regenerated during this phase by
      transferring heat from hotter canister 24A to cooler canister 24B.
      After a predetermined period of time heat regeneration is
      completed and pump 188 is deactivated. <br>
      <br>
      In the next phase, canister 24B is heated by external heat source
      190B, pump 188 is activated, solenoid valve 182 is opened to flow
      only from line 193C to 193A, solenoid valve 184 is opened to flow
      only from line 194A to 194C, thereby directing hot heat transfer
      fluid from pump 188 to canister 24A, to coil 117 in generator 115
      and back to pump 188. After a predetermined period of time the
      chemisorbent in canister 24B is desorbed a predetermined amount,
      the chemisorbent in canister 24A is absorbed a predetermined
      amount, external heat source 190B is turned off, solenoid valve
      182 is opened to flow only from line 193B to 193A, and solenoid
      valve 184 is opened to flow only from line 194A to 194B, thereby
      directing hot heat transfer fluid from canister 24B, to canister
      24A, to pump 188 and back to canister 24B. Heat is regenerated
      during this phase by transferring heat from hotter canister 24B to
      cooler canister 24A. After a predetermined period of time heat
      regeneration is completed and pump 188 is deactivated, thereby
      completing a cycle in higher temperature chemisorption circuit
      180. The cycle is then repeated. <br>
      <br>
      The operation of AHE system 111 is the same as described for FIG.
      10. <br>
      <br>
      It has been calculated that when the system of FIG. 11 is
      operated, with either ammonia-CaBr.sub.2 or ammonia-SrBr.sub.2 as
      the working fluid-chemisorbent pair, either with or without heat
      regeneration in higher temperature chemisorption circuit 180, with
      desorption at 15 bar, with chemisorption at 5 bar, the
      chemisorbent system will have a COP.sub.C ranging from about 0.40
      to about 0.43; see Tables 2 to 5. Combined with AHE system 111 as
      the lower temperature circuit, with desorption in generator 115 at
      15 bar, and with absorption in absorber 139 at 38.degree. C. and 5
      bar, with the AHE system having a COP.sub.C of about 0.6, the
      combined COP.sub.C will be from about 1.00 to about 1.03. <br>
      <br>
      Tables 2 to 5 represent analytical computer calculations using a
      computer program designated RSORB, for two different choices of
      higher temperature chemisorbents of FIG. 11. <br>
      <br>
      The input and output data of Table 2 correspond to chemisorbent
      24A and 24B being CaBr.sub.2 with no internal heat regeneration in
      the chemisorption circuit. <br>
      <br>
      The input and output data of Table 3 correspond to chemisorbent
      24A and 24B being CaBr.sub.2 with internal heat regeneration in
      the chemisorption circuit. <br>
      <br>
      The input and output data of Table 4 correspond to chemisorbent
      24A and 24B being SrBr.sub.2 with no internal heat regeneration in
      the chemisorption circuit. <br>
      <br>
      The input and output data of Table 5 correspond to chemisorbent
      24A and 24B being SrBr.sub.2 with internal heat regeneration in
      the chemisorption circuit. <br>
      <br>
      When the chemisorption circuit is operated with internal heat
      regeneration, as in Tables 3 and 5, each desorption step is
      required to be followed by a regeneration step which comprises
      circulating the heat transfer fluid through the loop comprising
      canister 24A and 24B and pump 188, during which external heat
      sources 190A and 190B are off. This heat regeneration step is
      omitted for the data presented in Tables 2 and 4. <br>
      <br>
      The cooling coefficients of performance, or COP.sub.C, for these
      four embodiments are generally seen to be from about 0.40 to about
      0.43 or a specific power from about 2.50628 to about 2.31714 as
      shown in Tables 2 to 5. <br>
      <br>
      FIG. 12 is a schematic flow diagram of another embodiment of this
      invention, of a heat transfer fluid circuit of a higher
      temperature chemisorption circuit, generally designated by numeral
      180, powering a lower temperature generator-absorber heat exchange
      (GAX) system, generally designated by numeral 211. The operation
      of higher temperature chemisorption circuit 180 is the same as
      that described for FIG. 11. <br>
      <br>
      In lower temperature GAX system 211, a weak ammonia-water solution
      213 in the bottom portion of generator 215, is heated by waste
      heat provided by higher temperature heat transfer fluid loop of
      chemisorption circuit 180, and specifically by heating coil 117,
      to produce ammonia vapor 219 at about 50.degree. C. and about 15
      bar. The high pressure ammonia vapor 219 flows from the generator
      through line 221 to condenser 223 wherein the gaseous ammonia
      stream is cooled and condensed, the heat of condensation
      transferred to the environment as indicated by arrow 224, and a
      low temperature, high pressure ammonia condensate 225 at about
      40.degree. C. and about 15 bar is formed. A stream of liquid
      ammonia from condenser 223 is expanded through Joule-Thomson valve
      229 to produce low temperature, low pressure ammonia liquid 233 at
      about 4.degree. C. and about 5 bar, which is then charged to
      evaporator means 231. A low temperature heat load, such as an
      interior building space, provides the heat of evaporation, as
      indicated by arrow 232, to vaporize the ammonia liquid in
      evaporator means 231 and produce low temperature, low pressure
      ammonia gas 233 at about 4.degree. C. and about 5 bar, which is
      charged to absorber 239 through line 240. <br>
      <br>
      A stream of weak high pressure ammonia-water solution 214 from
      generator 215 at about 150o.degree. C. and about 15 bar is
      expanded through Joule-Thomson valve 237, and charged to absorber
      239 and contacted with the stream of low pressure ammonia vapor
      conveyed by line 240 from evaporator 231. The ammonia vapor stream
      is absorbed by the weak ammonia-water solution stream in absorber
      239 to produce strong ammonia-water solution 241 which is
      collected in the bottom of absorber 239. A heat transfer fluid is
      pumped in a closed loop through heat exchange means 250 in heat
      exchange section 252 of absorber 239, and through heat exchange
      means 254 in heat exchange section 253 of generator 215. A portion
      of the heat of absorption is exhausted to the environment as
      indicated by arrow 242. Another portion of the heat of absorption
      is recovered by pumping a stream of strong ammonia-water solution
      243 is pumped by pump 244 at about 40.degree. C. and about 5 bar
      from the bottom section of absorber 239 through heat exchange
      section 235 of absorber 239, to section 245 of generator 215
      wherein ammonia is stripped from the strong solution at about
      150.degree. C. and about 15 bar, thereby forming ammonia vapor
      stream 219 and weak ammonia-water solution 213 which is collected
      in the bottom section of generator 215, thereby completing the
      absorption-desorption cycle. <br>
      <br>
      The operation of the heat transfer circuits for the embodiments
      illustrated in FIGS. 10 to 12 is determined by heat and ammonia
      sorption rates for the particular system in use, and is controlled
      in a predetermined manner by controllers 154 and 192 to achieve
      maximum efficiency for the system. <br>
