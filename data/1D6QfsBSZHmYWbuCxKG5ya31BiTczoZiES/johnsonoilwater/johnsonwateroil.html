      IF YOU believe that oil and water don’t mix, it’s time to meet
      Keith Johnson. Recently retired as a professor of materials
      physics at MIT, Johnson has succeeded where many have failed — by
      combining diesel fuel with tap water to form a mixture that cuts
      pollution, maintains engine efficiency and works in existing
      engines.<br>
      <br>
      His fuel is as simple to make as instant coffee, yet it is stable
      for years. If he can make it cheaply enough, it could improve the
      lives of millions of people who live in cities packed with old,
      diesel-powered buses and cars. Their clapped-out engines belch
      soot and nitrogen oxides (NOX) that damage the environment and
      cause lung disease. Clean up vehicle exhausts, and these cities
      should become cleaner and healthier places to live.<br>
      <br>
      The reason that his fuel is so stable and green, says Johnson, is
      that he has found a family of detergent-like surfactants that
      chemically bond molecules of water to molecules of the diesel,
      nudging the water molecules into stable 20-molecule clusters
      resembling “buckyballs”. Johnson calculates that these clusters
      pulsate with vibrations, an effect that endows them with
      remarkable chemical properties. He has licensed his discovery to
      Quantum Energy Technologies (QET), based in Cambridge,
      Massachusetts, which plans to make and market his watery fuel
      worldwide...&nbsp; <br>

      The present invention provides combustible compositions utilizing
      water clusters characterized by high oxygen reactivity due to
      protruding, delocalized p pi orbitals. In preferred embodiments,
      the compositions include one or more surfactants having molecular
      orbitals that interact with and participate in the delocalized p
      pi orbitals. The invention also provides methods of designing,
      producing, and using the compositions.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      Due to its critical importance in processes ranging from heat
      transfer to solvation and biological reactions, water has been
      extensively studied. However, the microscopic structure of water
      is still poorly understood. Only recently have systematic studies
      been undertaken to evaluate complex water structures (see, for
      example, Pugliano et al., Science 257:1937, 1992). None of the
      studies performed to date, all of which focus on hydrogen bonding
      capabilities, has provided a full picture of the structure and
      properties of water. Accordingly, there remains a need for
      development of a more accurate understanding of water structure
      and characteristics. Moreover, mechanisms for harnessing water's
      extraordinary properties for practical applications are required.<br>
      <br>
      One particular application for which water use has been explored
      is in the area of fuel combustion. In the past, water has been
      dispersed in fuels in order to i) decrease fuel flammability; ii)
      decrease the temperature of combustion; iii) reduce particulate
      emissions resulting from combustion; and/or iv) reduce levels of
      NOx emissions resulting from combustion (see, for example Donnelly
      et al., DOE/CS/50286-4, published September 1985; Compere et al.,
      ORNL TM-9603, published March 1985 by A. L. Compere et al.;
      Griffith et al., U.S. DOE ORNL TM-11248 DE89 017779). However, no
      stable, combustible water/fuel dispersion has made it to market.
      Several problems that have been encountered in the preparation of
      such compositions. There remains a need for a stable, inexpensive
      water/fuel composition that has improved combustion properties.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The present invention provides an analysis of water structure that
      reveals unexpected characteristics of certain molecular
      arrangements. While most prior investigations have focused on the
      role of hydrogen bonding in water, the present invention
      encompasses the discovery that second-nearest neighbor
      interactions between oxygen atoms in adjacent water molecules help
      determine the long-range properties of water.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention provides the discovery that oxygens on
      neighboring water molecules can interact with one another through
      overlap of oxygen p orbitals. This overlap produces degenerate,
      delocalized p.pi. orbitals that mediate long-range interactions
      among water molecules in liquid water. The present invention
      provides the further discovery that, in clusters of small numbers
      of water molecules, interactions among the water molecules can
      produce structures in which these degenerate, delocalized orbitals
      protrude from the structure surface in a manner that renders them
      available for reaction with other atoms or molecules. The
      invention therefore provides water clusters containing reactive
      oxygens. These oxygens can contribute to fuel combustion.<br>
      <br>
      Preferred water clusters of the present invention have high
      symmetry, preferably at least pentagonal symmetry. Also, it is
      preferred that oxygen-oxygen vibrational modes in the clusters are
      induced, either through application of an external electromagnetic
      or accoustical field or through intrinsic action of the dynamical
      Jahn-Teller (DJT) effect. As is known, the Jahn-Teller (JT) effect
      causes highly symmetrical structures to distort or deform along
      symmetry-determined vibronic coordinates (Bersuker et al.,
      "Vibronic Interactions in Molecules and Crystals" Springer-Verlag,
      1989). Potential energy minima corresponding to the
      broken-symmetry forms then arise, and the structure can either
      settle into one of these minima (static Jahn-Teller effect) or can
      oscillate between or among such minima by vibrating along the
      relevant vibrational coordinates (dynamical Jahn-Teller effect).<br>
      <br>
      The present invention provides the recognition that DJT-induced
      vibronic oscillations in certain water clusters can significantly
      lower the energy barrier for chemical reactions involving such
      clusters. Specifically, the present invention teaches that water
      clusters (or aggregates thereof) having a ground-state electronic
      structure characterized by a manifold of fully occupied molecular
      orbitals (HOMO) separated from a manifold of unoccupied molecular
      orbitals (LUMO) by an energy gap can be made to have enhanced
      reactivity characteristics if a degeneracy (or near degeneracy) is
      induced between the HOMO and LUMO states, leading to a prescribed
      distortive symmetry breaking and DJT-induced vibronic
      oscillations.<br>
      <br>
      In one particular embodiment, the present invention provides
      useful compositions including these reactive water clusters.
      Preferred compositions of the present invention are combustible
      compositions in which the water clusters are dispersed in, for
      example, a fuel. Certain preferred combustible compositions
      involve water clusters dispersed within a fuel and stabilized by
      one or more surfactants selected for an ability to contribute to
      the desirable electronic structure of the water cluster. Preferred
      surfactants donate one or more electrons to the delocalized p.pi.
      orbitals. In most cases, these preferred surfactants will be
      oxygen-rich compounds. Particularly preferred surfactants
      additionally have one or more of the following characteristics: i)
      they have appropriate density and miscibility attributes so that
      they mix readily with the water and fuel and the
      water/fuel/surfactant emulsion is stable for more than about one
      year; ii) they introduce no new toxicities into the composition
      (or into the environment upon combustion of the composition); and
      iii) they are inexpensive. The invention further provides methods
      of designing, making, and using such combustible compositions.<br>

      </b><b>DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</b><br>
      <br>
      As discussed above, the present invention encompasses a new theory
      of interactions between and among water molecules. In order to
      facilitate the understanding of the invention, we begin with a
      basic discussion of what is known about water structure.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 1 depicts the molecular orbital structure of a single water
      molecule. As can be seen, this structure can be effectively
      modeled as an interaction between an oxygen atom (left side) and a
      hydrogen (H2) molecule (right side). Oxygen has three p orbitals
      (px, py, and pz) available for interaction with the hydrogen
      molecule's .sigma. (bonding) and .sigma.* (antibonding) orbitals.
      Interaction between the oxygen and the hydrogen molecule produces
      three bonding orbitals: one that represents a bonding interaction
      between the oxygen Px orbital and the hydrogen .sigma. orbital;
      one that represents interaction of the oxygen py orbital with the
      antibonding hydrogen .sigma.* orbital; and one that represents the
      oxygen pz orbital. In FIG. 1, these orbitals are labelled with
      their symmetry designations, 1a1, 1b2, and b1, respectively.<br>
      <br>
      The oxygen/hydrogen molecule interaction also produces two
      antibonding orbitals: one that represents an antibonding
      interaction between the oxygen py orbital and the hydrogen
      .sigma.* orbital; and one that represents an antibonding
      interaction between the oxygen px orbital and the hydrogen .sigma.
      orbital. These orbitals are also given their symmetry
      designations, 2b2 and 2a1, respectively, in FIG. 1. For
      simplicity, the orbitals depicted in FIG. 1 will hereinafter be
      referred to by their symmetry designations. For example, the
      oxygen p@z orbital present in the water molecule will be referred
      to as the water b1 orbital.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention provides the discovery that, when water
      molecules are positioned near each other in appropriate
      configurations, the b1 orbital on a first water oxygen will
      interact with the 1b2 orbital on an adjacent, second water
      molecule, which in turn will interact with the b1 orbital of a
      third adjacent water molecule, etc. As shown in FIG. 2, when
      successive water molecules are oriented perpendicular to one
      another (FIG. 2A), the b1 and 1b2 orbitals on alternating
      molecules can interact (see FIG. 2B) to form delocalized
      p.pi.-type orbitals that extend along any number of adjacent
      waters.<br>
      <br>
      Those of ordinary skill in the art will readily appreciate that
      the larger the number of water molecules that are interacting with
      one another, the more different combinations of b1 and 1b2
      orbitals will be created, each producing a p.pi. orbital with a
      particular extent of bonding or antibonding character. For
      example, FIG. 3 presents possible orbitals produced by
      combinations of b1 and 1b2 orbitals on three water molecules; FIG.
      4 present possible p.pi. orbitals produced by combinations of b1
      and 1b2 orbitals on four water molecules. As can be seen, the
      larger the number of interacting water molecules, the larger the
      manifold of possible p.pi. orbitals.<br>
      <br>
      It will be appreciated that both the b1 and 1b2 orbitals in water
      are occupied. Accordingly, the oxygen-oxygen interactions
      described by the present invention involve interactions of filled
      orbitals. Traditional molecular orbital theory teaches that
      interactions between such filled orbitals typically do not occur
      because, due to repulsion between the electron pairs, the
      antibonding orbitals produced by the interaction are more
      destabilized than the bonding orbitals are stabilized. However, in
      the case of interacting oxygen atoms on adjacent water molecules,
      the interacting atoms are farther apart (about 2.8 .ANG., on
      average) than they would be if they were covalently bonded to one
      another. Thus, the electron-pair repulsion is weaker than it would
      otherwise be and such asymmetrical orbital splitting is not
      expected to occur. In fact, some "bonding" and "antibonding"
      orbital combinations can have substantially identical energies.
      The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) in water is,
      therefore, a manifold of substantially degenerate p.pi. orbitals
      with varying bonding and antibonding character; the lowest
      unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) in water represents a manifold
      of states corresponding to interactions involving 2b2 orbitals an
      adjacent water molecules.<br>
      <br>
      As described above, one aspect of the invention is the discovery
      that oxygen-oxygen interactions can occur among neighboring water
      molecules through overlap of b1 and 1b2 orbitals on adjacent
      oxygens that produces degenerate, delocalized p.pi. orbitals. A
      further aspect of the invention is the recognition that such p.pi.
      orbitals can protrude from the surface of a water structure and
      can impart high reactivity to oxygens within that structure. The
      inventors draw an analogy between the presently described water
      oxygen p.pi. orbitals and dwr orbitals known to impart reactivity
      to certain chemical catalysts (see, for example Johnson, in The
      New World of Quantum Chemistry, ed. by Pullman et al., Reidel
      Publishing Co., Dorderecht-Holland, pp. 317-356, 1976). According
      to the present invention, water oxygens can be made to catalyze
      their own oxidative addition to other molecules by incorporating
      them into water structures in which p.pi. delocalized orbitals
      associated with oxygen-oxygen interactions protrude from the
      structure surface.<br>
      <br>
      A further aspect of the invention provides the recognition that
      reactivity of water oxygens within structures having protruding
      p.pi. orbitals can be enhanced through amplification of certain
      oxygen-oxygen vibrational modes. It is known that the rate
      limiting step associated with oxidative addition of an oxygen atom
      from O2 is the dissociation of the oxygen atom from the O2
      molecule. Thus, in general, oxygen reactivity can be enhanced by
      increasing the ease with which the oxygen can be removed from the
      molecule with which it is originally associated. The present
      inventors have recognized that enhancement of oxygen-oxygen
      vibrational modes in water clusters increases the probability that
      a particular oxygen atom will be located a distance from the rest
      of the structure. Where the oxygen is participating in
      interactions that create a protruding p.pi. orbital, displacement
      of the oxygen away from the structure increases the probability
      that the p.pi. orbital will have the opportunity to overlap with
      orbitals of a potential reaction partner, and therefore increases
      the reactivity of the oxygen atom. Essentially, the vibrations
      create an orbital steering effect.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention therefore provides "water clusters" that are
      characterized by high oxygen reactivity as a result of their
      orbital and vibrational characteristics. A "water cluster", as
      that term is used herein, describes any arrangement of water
      molecules that has sufficient "surface reactivity" due to
      protruding p.pi. orbitals that the reactivity of cluster oxygens
      with other reactants is enhanced relative to the reactivity of
      oxygens in liquid water. Accordingly, so long as a sufficient
      number of p.pi. orbitals protrude from the cluster of water
      molecules in a way that allows increased interaction with nearby
      reactants, the requirements of the present invention are
      satisfied.<br>
      <br>
      Preferred water clusters of the present invention have symmetry
      characteristics. Symmetry increases the degeneracy of the p.pi.
      orbitals, and also produces more delocalized orbitals, thereby
      increasing the "surface reactivity" of the cluster. Symmetry also
      allows collective vibration of oxygen-oxygen interactions within
      the clusters, so that the likelihood that a protruding p.pi.
      orbital will have an opportunity to overlap with a potential
      reactant orbital is increased. Particularly preferred water
      clusters comprise pentagonal arrays of water molecules, and
      preferably comprise pentagonal arrays with maximum icosahedral
      symmetry. Most preferred clusters comprise pentagonal dodecahedral
      arrays of water molecules.<br>
      <br>
      Water clusters comprising pentagonal arrays of water molecules are
      preferred at least in part because the vibrational modes that can
      contribute to enhanced oxygen reactivity are associated with the
      oxygen-oxygen "squashing" and "twisting" modes (depicted for a
      pentagonal dodecahedral water structure in FIG. 5). These modes
      have calculated vibrational frequencies that lie between the far
      infrared and microwave regions of the electromagnetic spectrum,
      within the range of approximately 250 cm@-1 to 5 cm@-1. Induction
      of such modes may be accomplished resonantly, for example through
      application of electrical, electromagnetic, and/or ultrasonic
      fields, or may be accomplished intrinsically through the dynamical
      Jahn-Teller effect.<br>
      <br>
      As discussed above, the DJT effect refers to a symmetry-breaking
      phenomenon in which molecular vibrations of appropriate frequency
      couple with certain degenerate energy states available to a
      molecule, so that those states are split away from the other
      states with which they used to be degenerate (for review, see
      Bersuker et al., Vibronic Interactions in Molecules and Crystals,
      Springer Verlag, N.Y., 1990). Essentially, the Jahn-Teller effect
      (or the pseudo-Jahn-Teller effect) produces instability in
      high-symmetry structures that are in orbitally degenerate (or
      nearly degenerate) electronic states, causing the structures to
      distort or deform along symmetry-determined vibronic coordinates
      (Qs). The distorted structures have reduced-energy potential
      energy wells (A' in FIG. 6); the DJT effect can induce the large
      amplitude vibrations along vibronic coordinates that represent
      oscillations between these structures. These Jahn-Teller-induced
      potential minima, and the rapid dynamical-Jahn-Teller vibrations
      between them, can significantly lower the energy barrier for a
      chemical reaction (indicated as A.fwdarw.B in FIG. 7) involving
      the water structures. The reduction in energy barrier is
      qualitatively similar to that produced by a catalyst, but in this
      case the reaction pathway from the reactants A to the products B
      is predictably determined from symmetry by the DJT vibronic
      coordinates (Qs). Thus, natural coupling between the oxygen-oxygen
      vibrations and the degenerate p.pi. molecular orbitals of water
      clusters of the present invention can enhance oxygen reactivity.<br>
      <br>
      Water clusters having pentagonal symmetry are particularly
      preferred for use in the practice of the present invention because
      adjacent pentagonal clusters repel each other, imparting kinetic
      energy to the clusters that can contribute to their increased
      reactivity.<br>
      <br>
      It will be appreciated that not all of the molecules in the water
      clusters of the present invention need be water molecules per se.
      For example, molecules (such as alcohols, amines, etc.) that
      represent a substitution of a water hydrogen can be incorporated
      into water clusters of the invention without disrupting the
      oxygen-oxygen interactions. Methonal, ethanol, or any other
      substantially saturated alcohol is suitable in this regard. Other
      atoms, ions, or molecules (e.g., metal ions such as Cu and Ag) can
      additionally or alternatively be included in the structure so long
      as they don't interfere with formation of the reactive p.pi.
      orbital(s). Preferred atoms, ions, or molecules participate in
      and/or enhance the formation of the p.pi. orbitals. The water
      structures themselves may also be protonated or ionized. Given
      that not all of the molecules in the cluster need be water
      molecules, we herein describe certain desirable characteristics of
      inventive water clusters with reference to the number of oxygens
      in the cluster.<br>
      <br>
      Preferred water clusters of the present invention are
      "nanodroplets", preferably smaller than about 20 .ANG. in their
      longest dimension, and preferably comprising between about 5 and
      300 oxygens. Particularly preferred clusters include between about
      20 and 100 oxygens. Most preferred water clusters contain
      approximately 20 oxygens and have pentagonal dodecahedral
      symmetry.<br>
      <br>
      Particular embodiments of preferred inventive water clusters for
      use in the practice of the present invention are presented in
      FIGS. 8-14 FIG. 8 shows a 5-molecule water cluster with pentagonal
      symmetry, FIG. 9 shows one of the p.pi. orbitals associated with
      this cluster. Solid lines represent the positive phase of the
      orbital wave function; dashed lines represent the negative phase.
      As can be seen with reference to FIG. 9, a delocalized p.pi.
      orbital forms that protrudes from the surface of the cluster. This
      orbital (and others) is available for interaction with orbitals of
      neighboring reaction partners. Overlap with an orbital lobe of the
      same phase as the protruding p.pi. orbital lobe will create a
      bonding interaction between the relevant cluster oxygen and the
      reaction partner.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 10 shows a 10-molecule water cluster with partial pentagonal
      symmetry; FIG. 11 shows one of its delocalized p.pi. orbitals. As
      can be seen, the orbital delocalization (and protrusion) is
      primarily associated with the water molecules in the pentagonal
      arrangement. Thus, FIG. 11 demonstrates one of the advantages of
      high symmetry in the water clusters of the present invention: the
      p.pi. orbital associated with the pentagonally-arranged water
      molecules is more highly delocalized and protrudes more
      effectively from the surface. The orbital therefore creates
      surface reactivity not found with the oxygens in water molecules
      that are not part of the pentagonal array.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 12 shows a 20-molecule water cluster with pentagonal
      dodecahedral symmetry; FIG. 13, Panels A-E show various of its
      p.pi. orbitals. Once again, extensive orbital delocalization and
      surface protrusion is observed in this highly symmetrical
      structure. For comparison, the normally unoccupied culster
      molecular orbitals associated with the same structure are depicted
      in FIGS. 14-16. More delocalization is observed over the cluster
      surface, implying greater reactivity when these orbitals become
      occupied (e.g., through Jahn-Teller symmetry breaking or through
      electronic charge addition.<br>
      <br>
      Water clusters comprising more than approximately 20 water
      molecules are not specifically depicted in Figures presented
      herein, but are nonetheless useful in the practice of the present
      invention. For example, clusters comprising approximately 80
      molecules can assume an ellipsoidal configuration with protruding
      p.pi. orbitals at the curved ends. When clusters comprise more
      than approximately 300 water molecules, however, the cluster tends
      to behave more like liquid water, which shows low "surface
      reactivity." Of course, if the cluster were to comprise a large
      number (&gt;300) of water molecules all arranged in stable
      symmetrical structures (e.g., several stable pentagonal
      dodecahedral), these problems would not be encountered. Such
      "aggregates" of the inventive water clusters are therefore within
      the scope of the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      As has been mentioned, water clusters comprising pentagonal
      dodecahedral molecular arrangements are particularly preferred for
      use in the practice of the present invention. Accordingly,
      pentagonal dodecahedral water structures are discussed in more
      detail below. Those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate,
      however, that the following discussion is not intended to limit
      the scope of the present invention, and that any and all
      embodiments encompassed by the above broad description fall within
      the scope of the claims.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Pentagonal Dodecahedral Water Clusters</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Pentagonal dodecahedral water structures (such as, for example,
      (H2 O)20, (H2 O)20@++, (H2 O)20 H@+, (H2 O)21 H@+,and (H2 O)20@-,
      as well as analogous structures including alcohol molecules) are
      particularly preferred for use in the practice of the present
      invention because, as shown in FIG. 13, delocalized p.pi. orbitals
      protrude from the dodecahedron vertices, so that all 20 oxygens in
      the structure are predicted to have enhanced reactivity.
      Furthermore, Coulomb repulsion between like-charged dodecahedra
      can render pentagonal dodecahedral structures kinetically
      energetic. Also, the symmetry of the structure produces degenerate
      molecular orbitals that can couple with oxygen-oxygen vibrational
      modes in the far infrared to microwave regions, resulting in
      increased reactivity of the structure oxygens. As discussed above,
      these modes can be induced through application of appropriate
      fields, or through the dynamical Jahn-Teller effect.<br>
      <br>
      Quantum mechanics computations reveal that the Jahn-Teller-active
      molecular orbitals of a pentagonal dodecahedral water cluster have
      protruding lobes available for overlap with orbitals of potential
      reaction partners (see FIGS. 13-16); certain of the orbitals have
      the shapes of large "s", "p", and "d" atomic-like orbitals (see
      FIGS. 14-16) that are spatially delocalized around the surface
      oxygen atoms of the cluster. It is the availability of these
      orbitals, particularly the "p-like" and "d-like" ones, that allows
      the clusters to "catalyze" and/or provide their oxygens to various
      chemical reactions. The rate constant for reactions is given by
      the equation:<br>
      <br>
      .kappa.=Ae@-E barrier/RT<br>
      <br>
      The pre-exponential term, A, in this equation increases with the
      frequency of collision (orbital overlap) between water clusters
      and their potential reaction partners. This collision frequency,
      in turn, increases with the effective collisional cross-sectional
      areas of the reactants, which is proportional to the square of the
      reactant molecular-orbital diameter, d. Pentagonal dodecahedral
      water clusters have a relatively large molecular orbital diameter
      (.about.8 .ANG.). Furthermore, this diameter is effectively
      increased through the action of the Jahn-Teller-induced low
      frequency vibrational modes (see, e.g. FIG. 5). Thus, when
      Ebarrier is low pentagonal dodecahedral waters are likely to be
      significantly more reactive than liquid waters. As described
      above, Ebarrier is lowered by coupling with the DJT-induced
      symmetry-breaking low frequency vibrational modes. Furthermore,
      the coupling of electrons and DJT-induced cluster vibrations can
      lead to the conversion of electronic energy to vibronic energy, so
      that the potential energy of the cluster is increased by
      .DELTA.Evib (see FIG. 6), resulting a further effective lowering
      of the energy barrier separating reactants and products.<br>
      <br>
      It should be noted that pentagonal dodecahedral water structures
      had been produced and analyzed well before the development of the
      present invention. As early as 1973, researchers were reporting
      unexpected stabilities of water clusters of the form H@+ (H2 O)20
      and H@+ (H2 O)21 (see, for example, Lin, Rev. Sci. Instrum.
      44:516, 1973; Searcy et al., J. Chem. Phys. 61:5282, 1974; Holland
      et al., J. Chem. Phys. 72:11, 1980; Yang et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc.
      111:6845, 1989; Wei et al., J. Chem. Phys. 94:3268, 1991).
      However, prior art analyses of these structures centered around
      discussions of hydrogen bond interactions, and struggled to
      explain their structure and energetics (see, for example, Laasonen
      et al., J. Phys. Chem. 98:10079, 1994). No prior art reference
      discussed the oxygen-oxygen interactions described herein, and
      none recognized the increased reactivity of cluster oxygens.
      Moreover, no prior art reference recognized the desirability of
      inducing particular vibrational modes in these clusters in order
      to increase oxygen reactivity.<br>
      <br>
      On the other hand, certain elements of the data collected in prior
      art studies are consistent with and can be explained by the theory
      presented herein. For example, the present invention predicts that
      low-frequency vibrations attributable to oxygen-oxygen bonds at
      the vertices of pentagonal dodecahedral structures should be
      observable by Raman scattering. Several groups have reported low
      frequency Raman scattering in water (see, for example, Rousset et
      al., J. Chem. Phys. 92:2150, 1990; Majolino et al., Phys. Rev.
      E47:2669, 1993; Mizoguchi et al., J. Chem. Phys. 97:1961, 1992),
      but each has offered its own explanation for the effect, none of
      which involves vibrations of oxygen-oxygen bonds at the vertices
      of pentagonal dodecahedral structures. In fact, Sokolov et al.
      recently, summarized the state of understanding of the observed
      low frequency vibrations by saying "the description of the
      spectrum and its relation with the critical behavior of other
      properties are still not clear" (Sokolov et al., Phys. Rev. B
      51:12865, 1995). The present invention solves this problem.<br>
      <br>
      The analysis of water structure provided by the present invention
      explains several observations about water properties that cannot
      be understood through studies of hydrogen bond interactions. For
      example, Seete et al. (Phys. Rev. Lett 75:850, 1995) have reported
      propagation of "fast sound" through liquid water is not dependent
      on the hydrogen isotope employed. Accordingly, fast sound cannot
      be propagating only on the hydrogen network.<br>
      <br>
      According to the present invention, preferred pentagonal
      dodecahedral water structures include (H2 O)20, (H2 O)20@++, (H2
      O)20 H@+, (H2 O)21 H@+, and (H2 O)20. Also preferred are
      structures including one or more alcohol molecules, or other
      molecules (e.g., surfactants) that can contribute to the desirable
      delocalized electronic structure, substituted for water. Preferred
      structures may also include clathrated (or otherwise bonded) ions,
      atoms, molecules or other complex organic or metallo-organic
      ligands. In fact, clathration can act to stabilize pentagonal
      dodecahedral water structures. Preferred clathration structures
      include (H2 O)21 H@+ structures in which an H3 O@+ molecule is
      clathrated within a pentagonal dodecahedral shell. Other preferred
      clathrated structures include those in which a metal ion is
      clathrated by pentagonal dodecahedral water. Negatively charged
      structures are particularly preferred; such structures contain one
      or more electrons in the above-described normally unoccupied
      orbital and are even more reactive than the neutral and positively
      charged species. Any water structure in which an electron has been
      introduced into the above-mentioned orbital is a "negatively
      charged" structure according to the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      Water clusters containing stable pentagonal dodecahedral water
      structures may be produced in accordance with the present
      invention by any of a variety of methods. In liquid water,
      pentagonal dodecahedral structures probably form transiently, but
      are not stable. In fact, liquid water can be modeled as a
      collection of pentagonal dodecahedra in which inter-structure
      interactions are approximately as strong as, or stronger than,
      intra-structure interactions. Accordingly, in order to produce
      stable pentagonal dodecahedral water structures from liquid water,
      the long-range inter-structure interactions present in liquid
      water must be disrupted in favor of the intra-structure
      association. Any of a variety of methods, including physical,
      chemical, electrical, and electromagnetic methods, can be used to
      accomplish this. For example, perhaps the most straightforward
      method of isolating pentagonal dodecahedral water structures is
      simply to isolate 20 or 21 water molecules in a single
      nanodroplet. Preferred water clusters of the present invention
      comprise 20 to 21 water molecules.<br>
      <br>
      Other methods of producing pentagonal dodecahedral water
      structures include passing water vapor through a hypersonic
      nozzle, as is known in the art (see, for example Lin, Rev. Sci.
      Instrum. 44:516, 1973; Searcy et al., J. Chem. Phys. 61:5282,
      1974). All known methods of hypersonic nozzling are useful in
      accordance with the present invention. The present invention,
      however, also provides an improved hypersonic nozzling method for
      preparing pentagonal dodecahedral water structures. Specifically,
      in a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the hypersonic
      nozzle comprises a catalytic material such as nickel or a nickel
      alloy positioned and arranged so that, as water passes through the
      nozzle, it comes in contact with reacting orbitals on the
      catalytic material. Under such conditions, the catalytic material
      is expected to disrupt inter-cluster bonding, by sending electrons
      into anti-bonding orbitals, without interfering with intra-cluster
      bonding interactions.<br>
      <br>
      Chemical methods for producing water clusters comprising
      pentagonal dodecahedral structures include the use of surfactants
      and/or clathrating agents. Electrical methods include inducing
      electrical breakdown of inter-cluster interactions by providing an
      electrical spark of sufficient voltage and appropriate frequency.
      Electromagnetic methods include application of microwaves of
      appropriate frequency to interact with the "squashing" vibrational
      modes of inter-cluster oxygen-oxygen interactions. Also, since it
      is known that ultrasound waves can cavitate (produce bubbles in)
      water, it is expected that inter-cluster associations can be
      disrupted ultrasonically without interfering with intra-cluster
      interactions. Finally, various other methods have been reported
      for the production of pentagonal dodecahedral water structures as
      can be employed in the practice of the present invention. Such
      methods include ion bombardment of ice surfaces (Haberland, in
      Electronic and Atomic Collisions, ed. by Eichler et al., Elsevier,
      Ansterdam, pp. 597-604, 1984), electron impact ionization (Lin,
      Rev. Sci. Instrum. 44:516, 1973; Hermann et al., J. Chem. Phys.
      72:185, 1982; Dreyfuss et al., J. Chem. Phys. 76:2031, 1982; Stace
      et al., Chem. Phys. Lett. 96:80, 1983; Echt et al., Chem. Phys.
      Lett. 108:401, 1989), and near-threshold vacuum-UV photoionization
      of neutral clusters (Shinohara et al., Chem. Phys. 83:4183, 1985;
      Nagashima et al., J. Chem. Phys. 84:209, 1986)].<br>
      <br>
      However the pentagonal dodecahedral water structures are initially
      produced, it may be desirable to ionize them (e.g., by passing
      them through an electrical potential after they are formed) in
      order to increase their kinetic energy, and therefore their
      reactivity, through coulombic repulsion.<br>
      <br>
      As mentioned above, negatively charged structures are particularly
      useful in the preactice of the present invention. Such negatively
      charged structures may be produced, for example, chemically (e.g.,
      by selecting a surfactant or additive that contributes one or more
      electrons to the LUMO), by direct addition of one or more
      electrons to the LUMO (e.g., by means of an electronic injector),
      or, if the energy gap between the HOMO and the LUMO is of the
      appropriate size, photoelectrically (e.g., using uv light to
      excite an electron into the LUMO). Of course, any other available
      method that successfully introduces one of more electrons into the
      LUMO may latematively be used.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Applications</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      As described above, the present invention provides reactive water
      clusters reactive oxygens. The invention also provides methods of
      using such clusters, particularly in "oxidative" reactions (i.e.,
      in reactions that involve transfer of an oxygen from one molecule
      to another). The clusters can be employed in any oxidative
      reaction, in combination with any appropriate reaction partner.<br>
      <br>
      One particularly useful application of the water structures of the
      present invention is in combustion. According to the present
      invention, the reactive water oxygens can efficiently combine with
      carbon in a fuel so that the specific energy of the combustion
      reaction is increased.<br>
      <br>
      In order to model the reactivity of water structure oxygens with
      neighboring carbons, the inventors have analyzed pentagonal
      dodecahedral water clusters ionteracting with aromatic molecular
      soot precursors and C16 H34 (cetane-diesel) fuel molecules. FIGS.
      17 and 18, respectively, present calculated highest occupied p.pi.
      orbitals for these structures. As can be seen with both
      structures, electron density between the carbon and oxygen is
      high.<br>
      <br>
      The structures depicted in FIGS. 17 and 18 model systems in which
      an isolated pentagonal dodecahedral water cluster is surrounded
      with hydrocarbon molecules. The high electron density between the
      cluster oxygen and adjacent carbon indicate that the likelihood
      that the oxygen will be oxidatively added to the carbon is
      increased. Thus, the present invention teaches that dispersions of
      water clusters in fuel should have enhanced specific energy of
      fuel combustion as compared with fuel alone. Also, the invention
      teaches that the dispersed water molecules promote combuistion of
      soot molecules, thereby reducing particular matter emmissions.
      Accordingly, one aspect of the present invention comprises
      combustible compositions comprising water clusters dispersed in
      fuel. The compositions are designed to include water structures
      with reactive oxygens and to maximize interaction of the fuel with
      those oxygens.<br>
      <br>
      Fuels that can usefully be employed in the water cluster/fuel
      compositions of the present invention include any hydrocarbon
      source capable of interaction with reactive oxygens in water
      clusters of the present invention. Preferred fuels include
      gasoline and diesel. Diesel fuel is particularly preferred.<br>
      <br>
      Water cluster/fuel compositions of the present invention may be
      prepared by any means that allows formation of water clusters with
      reactive oxygens and exposes a sufficient number of such reactive
      oxygens to the fuel so that the specific energy of combustion is
      enhanced as compared to the specific energy observed when pure
      fuel is combusted under the same conditions.<br>
      <br>
      For example, in one preferred embodiment of the invention, the
      compositions are prepared by combining fuel and water together
      under supercritical conditions. Water has a critical temperature
      of 374 DEG C. Above this temperature, no amount of hydrostatic
      pressure will initiate a phase change back to the liquid state.
      The minimum pressure required to reliquify water just below its
      critical temperature, known as the critical pressure, is 221
      atmospheres. Provisional application entitled "Supercritical Fuel
      and Water Compositions", filed on even date herewith and
      incorporated herein by reference, discloses that single-phase
      fuel/water compositions can be prepared under supercritical
      conditions. Without wishing to be bound by any particular theory,
      we propose that such single-phase compositions represent water
      clusters of the present invention dispersed within the fuel.
      Accordingly, desirable water cluster/fuel compositions of the
      present invention may be prepared through supercritical processing
      as described in the above-mentioned, incorporated provisional
      application.<br>
      <br>
      In an alternative preferred embodiment of the present invention,
      the inventive water cluster fuel compositions are prepared by a
      process in which stable water structures that contain reactive
      oxygens are prepared prior to introduction of the water into the
      water cluster/fuel compositions. Surfactants may be employed to
      stabilize the water cluster/fuel compositions if desired.<br>
      <br>
      When utilized, surfactants should be selected to participate in
      the desired electronic and vibrational characteristics of the
      water clusters. Preferred surfactants also donate one or more
      electrons to the water cluster LUMO. Particularly preferred
      surfactants are characterized by one or more of the following
      additional features: i) low cost; ii) high density as compared
      with fuel; iii) viscosity approximating that of the fuel (so that
      the composition flows freely through a standard diesel engine);
      iv) ready miscibility with other fuel components; v) absence of
      new toxicities (so that the inventive composition is no more toxic
      than the fuel alone); vi) stability to exposure to temperatures as
      low as -30 DEG C. and as high as 120 DEG C.; and vii) ability to
      form an emulsion composition with the fuel and water that is
      stable for at least about one year.<br>
      <br>
      Preferred inventive surfactant-containing combustible compositions
      utilize surfactants with relatively oxygen-rich hydrophilic ends.
      For example, preferred surfactants have carboxyl (COOH), ethoxyl
      (CH2 --O), CO3, and/or NO3 groups. Preferably, the surfactant also
      has at least one long (preferably 6-20 carbons) linear or branched
      hydrophobic tail that is soluble in the fuel. Compositions
      containing carboxylate surfactants preferably also contain a
      neutralizing base such as ammonia (NH4 OH) or methyl amine (MEA).
      Typically, the secondary surfactant is relatively less polar than
      the primary surfactant (e.g., is an alcohol) and interacts less
      strongly with the water phase, but has a hydrocarbon tail that
      orients and controls the primary surfactant, for example through
      van der Waals interactions. Preferred primary surfactants for use
      in accordance with the present invention include fatty acids
      having a carboxylate polar group. For example, oleic acid,
      linoleic acid, and stearic acid are preferred primary surfactants.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 19 depicts a water cluster interacting with a typical fatty
      acid by sharing molecular orbitals, according to the present
      invention. As can be seen with reference to FIG. 19, surfactant
      molecular orbitals effectively donates an electron to and
      participate in the delocalized p.pi. water cluster orbital.<br>
      <br>
      Other components may also be included in the inventive combustible
      compositions. For example, as discussed above, it is sometimes
      desirable to add one or more neutralizing agents. Particularly
      where the surfactant is an organic acid such as, for example, a
      fatty acid (e.g., see FIG. 19), such neutralizing agents are
      likely to be desirable. Examples of preferred neutralizing agents
      include, but are not limited to methyl amine and ammonia. Addition
      of such a neutralizing agent has the effect of placing a nitrogen
      atom at the center of the water cluster, thereby promoting
      electron delocalization to the cluster periphery, for example as
      shown in FIG. 20.<br>
      <br>
      It is important to note that the present invention is not the
      first description of the use of surfactants in combustible
      water/fuel compositions. However, the prior art does not include
      identification of the desirable water clusters as described
      herein, nor of the appropriate surfactants selected for
      interaction with the water cluster molecular orbitals.<br>
      <br>
      In order that the fuel in the water cluster/fuel compositions of
      the present invention be exposed to the maximum number of reactive
      oxygens, it is desirable to minimize the size of the water
      clusters in the water cluster/fuel compositions, therefore
      increasing the combustion efficiency. Preferably, the water
      clusters have an average diameter of no more than about 20 .ANG.
      along their longest dimension. More preferably, each cluster
      comprises fewer than about 300 water molecules. In particularly
      preferred embodiments, the water cluster/fuel composition
      comprises individual pentagonal dodecahedral water clusters
      dispersed within the fuel.<br>
      <br>
      It will be appreciated that the extent of interaction between the
      hydrocarbon fuel and reactive oxygens in the water will depend not
      only on the size (and surface reactivity) of the water clusters in
      the composition, but also on the number of water clusters
      dispersed within the fuel. Preferred water cluster/fuel
      compositions contain between about 1% and 20% water, preferably
      between about 3% and 15% water, and most preferably between about
      5% and 12% water. Particularly preferred water cluster/fuel
      compositions contain at least about 50% water.<br>
      <br>
      As mentioned above, the water cluster/fuel compositions of the
      present invention are preferably prepared so that the specific
      energy of combustion is as close as possible to that of pure fuel.
      Preferably, the specific energy is at least about 85%, more
      preferably at least about 90%, and yet more preferably at least
      about 95-99% that of pure fuel. In some particularly preferred
      embodiments, the specific energy of combustion of inventive
      compositions is higher than that of pure fuel. Preferably, the
      specific energy is increased at least about 1-2%, more preferably
      at least about 10%, still more preferably at least about 15-20%,
      and most preferably at least about 50%.<br>
      <br>
      As described in the Examples, we have prepared various water
      cluster/fuel compositions and have tested their combustive
      properties in a standard diesel engine, under normal operating
      conditions. As can be seen, emission data compiled from combustion
      of these emulsions, and reveals that NOx and particulate emissions
      are reduced upon combustion of the inventive emulsions; CO levels
      are increased.<br>
      <br>
      The water phase of the inventive emulsions described in Example 1
      had a particle size of about 4-7 .ANG.. Moreover, the phase was
      shown to include inventive water clusters, characterized by
      oxygen-oxygen vibrational modes. Specifically, an isotope effect
      was observed in the region of about 100-150 cm@-1 of the Raman
      spectra of emulsions containing H2 O@18 (see FIG. 22). This effect
      reveals that vibrations including oxygens are responsible for the
      spectral lines observed in that region.<br>
      <br>
      The emulsion analyses described in Example 2 showed that
      decreasing water cluster size (micelle size) correlated with i)
      increases in the weight percent of water in the composition; ii)
      decreases in NOx emission; iii) increases in CO emission; and iv)
      increases in combustion efficiency. Interestingly, previous
      reports had reported that NOx emissions could be reduced in prior
      art combustible composition by decreasing the combustion
      temperature. Since reductions in combustion temperature are
      expected to restrict the extent of combustion, these reports would
      suggest that CO levels would decrease in parallel with NOx levels.
      We observe the opposite, presumably because the inventive
      compositions increase, rather than decrease, the extent of
      combustion by providing appropriate electronic configurations.
      Thus, combustion of inventive emulsions results in lower NOx
      emission but higher CO emission than combustion of diesel alone.<br>
      <br>
      The results presented in the Examples were achieved by combusting
      diesel or water cluster/diesel emulsions in a standard diesel
      engine. The present invention can therefore readily be implemented
      with existing technology. However, an additional aspect of the
      invention involves altering the design of engines used in
      combustion of water cluster/fuel compositions of the present
      invention.<br>
      <br>
      One embodiment of an altered engine for use in the practice of the
      present invention is a derivative of standard diesel engine,
      altered so as not to have a functional air intake valve. Given
      that the oxygen used in combustion of the inventive water
      cluster/fuel compositions can come from the water instead of from
      air, air intake should not be required.<br>
      <br>
      More dramatic changes in engine design are also envisioned. For
      example, FIG. 23 presents one embodiment of a new engine for
      combusting water cluster/fuel compositions of the present
      invention. As shown, water clusters 100 are injected into a
      chamber 200, into which fuel 300 is also injected. The water
      clusters may be prepared by any of the means described above, but
      preferably are prepared by ejection from a hypersonic nozzle. In
      preferred embodiments, the nozzle comprises a catalytic material.
      In some embodiments, the clusters are also ionized by passage
      through a potential.<br>
      <br>
      As has been discussed herein, it is desirable to expose the fuel
      to the water clusters in a way that maximizes interaction between
      fuel carbons and water oxygens. Because pentagonal dodecahedral
      water structures have high surface reactivity particularly
      preferred embodiments of the invention inject individual
      pentagonal dodecahedral water structures into the chamber. One
      additional advantage of injecting water clusters into a chamber,
      and particularly of injecting individual pentagonal dodecahedral
      water structures, is that it allows the Coulombic repulsion
      between individual water clusters to be harnessed as kinetic
      energy, thereby increasing the energy available for conversion
      during combustion.<br>
      <br>
      Once inside the chamber, the water cluster/fuel composition is
      ignited according to standard procedures. As mentioned above, air
      intake is not required.<br>
      <br>
      Those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that many of
      the known variations to engine structure and combustion conditions
      may be incorporated into the present invention. For example,
      various additives may be included in the water cluster/fuel
      composition in order to improve combustibility, stability,
      lubricity, corrosion-resistance or other desirable
      characteristics.<br>
      <br>

      Water cluster/fuel emulsions were prepared according to the
      following method:<br>
      <br>
      <img src="us5800t1.JPG" alt="t1" width="364" height="121"><br>
      <br>
      The water can be distilled water or tap water, or a mixture of
      water and a short chain alcohol such as methanol. Surfactant I has
      the structure Cx H20 (OCH2 CH2)y OH, where x=8-10 and y=4-10.
      Surfactant II is a polyglyceril-oleate or cocoate. Surfactant III
      is a short chain, (C2-8) linear alcohol.<br>
      <br>
      The emulsions were prepared by mixing the Diesel with Surfactant I
      and II. Water and surfactant III were then added simultaneously.
      The water nanodroplets in the emulsion had a grain size of about
      4-7 .ANG.. Two particular formulations were prepared that had the
      following components:<br>
      <br>
      <img src="us5800t2.JPG" alt="t2" width="306" height="226"><br>
      <br>
      Raman spectra of Formulation 2, were taken using laser excitation
      at both 406.7 nm and 647.1 nm. The spectra at 406.7 nm were highly
      fluorescent and only anti-stokes scattering/emission was carefully
      examined. The results at 647.1 nm did not have these problems.
      Isotope shift experiments were performed by introducing H2 O@18
      into the emulsions. The H2 O/H2 O@18 difference spectrum is
      presented as FIG. 22. As can be seen, a peak was observed around
      100-150 cm@-1, in the region associated with oxygen-oxygen
      squashing vibrational modes. Accordingly, it was concluded that
      the Formulation 2 emulsion contained water clusters having at
      least pentagonal symmetry.<br>
      <br>
      The water cluster/fuel emulsions were weighed and then were pumped
      into a small YANMAR diesel engine. Energy output, injection
      timing, and engine operation were monitored according to standard
      techniques. Exhaust samples were taken and emissions were analyzed
      also according to standard techniques.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 21 presents the results of emissions analysis of two water
      cluster/fuel emulsions, Formulation 1 and Formulation 2. As can be
      seen, NOx and particulate levels are reduced, and CO levels may be
      increased.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 2</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>Preparation and Analysis of Combustible Water Cluster/Fuel
        Emulsions:</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Water cluster/fuel emulsions were prepared according to the
      following method:<br>
      <br>
      The fatty acid based microemulsion fuels were made by mixing of
      diesel fuel, partially neutralized fatty acid surfactant, water,
      and an alcohol co-surfactant. The fuel is Philips D-2 Diesel or
      the equivalent. The water is distilled water or tap water. Alcohol
      co-surfactants utilized include t-butyl alcohol (TBA), n-butyl
      alcohol (NBA), methyl benzyl alcohol (MBA) and methanol (MeOH),
      isopropyl alcohol (IPA), and t-amyl alcohol (TAA). Fatty acids
      include tall oil fatty acids (TOFA) and Emersol 315 (E-315)
      refined vegetable fatty acid. Specifically, the fatty acid should
      be only partially neutralized, with the optimum degree of
      neutralization depending on the specific alkanolamine used. MEA
      (monoethanolamine) was preferably used to neutralize the fatty
      acid by gradual addition to the fatty acid during mixing.<br>
      <br>
      When a (macro)emulsion is first made from diesel, surfactant and
      water (without the alcohol), the mixture converts to a
      microemulsion within seconds of addition and mild mixing of the
      alcohol co-surfactant. When mixing the components sequentially,
      the order of addition affects the ease of mixing. It is more
      difficult to disperse water when it is added last due to the
      formation of localized streamers of waxy precipitates, which
      require more intense mixing to disperse and form the final
      microemulsion.<br>
      <br>
      Additionally, "microemulsifier concentrates", consisting of all
      the ingredients needed to form a microemulsion except the base
      fuel itself, can be mixed without difficulty to form low
      viscosity, single phase mixtures (i.e. no gels). The concentrates
      can then be blended directly with diesel fuel with moderate
      mixing, to form water-in-oil microemulsion fuels.<br>
      <br>
      The particular formulations that were prepared are shown in
      Appendix A.<br>
      <br>
      The water cluster/fuel emulsions were weighed and then were pumped
      into a small YANMAR diesel engine. Energy output, injection
      timing, and engine operation were monitored according to standard
      techniques. Exhaust samples were taken and emissions were analyzed
      also according to standard techniques.<br>

      <br>
      The present invention provides water cluster compositions
      characterized by high oxygen reactivity due to protruding,
      delocalized p pi orbitals. The invention also provides methods of
      producing the structures. The invention further provides methods
      of using the water clusters, for example in combustion, and
      compositions associated therewith.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Due to its critical importance in processes ranging from heat
      transfer to solvation and biological reactions, water has been
      extensively studied. However, the microscopic structure of water
      is still poorly understood. Only recently have systematic studies
      been undertaken to evaluate complex water structures (see, for
      example, Pugliano et al., Science 257:1937, 1992). None of the
      studies performed to date, all of which focus on hydrogen bonding
      capabilities, has provided a full picture of the structure and
      properties of water. Accordingly, there remains a need for
      development of a more accurate understanding of water structure
      and characteristics. Moreover, mechanisms for harnessing water's
      extraordinary properties for practical applications are required.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The present invention provides an analysis of water structure that
      reveals unexpected characteristics of certain molecular
      arrangements. While most prior investigations have focussed on the
      role of hydrogen bonding in water, the present invention
      encompasses the discovery that second-nearest neighbor
      interactions between oxygen atoms in adjacent water molecules help
      determine the long-range properties of water.<br>

      The present invention provides the discovery that oxygens on
      neighboring water molecules can interact with one another through
      overlap of oxygen p orbitals. This overlap produces degenerate,
      delocalized p.pi. orbitals that mediate long-range interactions
      among water molecules in liquid water. The present invention
      provides the further discovery that, in clusters of small numbers
      of water molecules, interactions among the water molecules can
      produce structures in which p.pi. orbitals protrude from the
      structure surface in a manner that renders them available for
      reaction with other atoms or molecules. The invention therefore
      provides water clusters containing reactive oxygens. Preferred
      clusters have at least pentagonal symmetry. Also, it is preferred
      that oxygen-oxygen vibrational modes in the clusters are induced,
      either through application of an external field or through
      intrinsic action of the dynamical Jahn-Teller (DJT) effect.<br>

      </b><b>DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      As discussed above, the present invention encompasses a new theory
      of interactions between and among water molecules. In order to
      facilitate the understanding of the invention, we begin with a
      basic discussion of what is known about water structure.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 1 depicts the molecular orbital structure of a single water
      molecule. As can be seen, this structure can be effectively
      modeled as an interaction between an oxygen atom (left side) and a
      hydrogen (H2) molecule (right side). Oxygen has three p orbitals
      (px, py, and pz) available for interaction with the hydrogen
      molecule's .sigma. (bonding) and .sigma.* (antibonding) orbitals.
      Interaction between the oxygen and the hydrogen molecule produces
      three bonding orbitals: one that represents a bonding interaction
      between the oxygen px orbital and the hydrogen .sigma. orbital;
      one that represents interaction of the oxygen py orbital with the
      antibonding hydrogen .sigma.* orbital; and one that represents the
      oxygen pz orbital. In FIG. 1, these orbitals are labelled with
      their symmetry designations, 1a1, 1b2, and b1, respectively.<br>
      <br>
      The oxygen-hydrogen molecule interaction also produces two
      antibonding orbitals: one that represents an antibonding
      interaction between the oxygen py orbital and the hydrogen
      .sigma.* orbital; and one that represents an antibonding
      interaction between the oxygen px orbital and the hydrogen .sigma.
      orbital. These orbitals are also given their symmetry
      designations, 2b2 and 2a1, respectively, in FIG. 1. For
      simplicity, the orbitals depicted in FIG. 1 will hereinafter be
      referred to by their symmetry designations. For example, the
      oxygen pz orbital present in the water molecule will be referred
      to as the water b1 orbital.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention provides the discovery that, when water
      molecules are positioned near each other in appropriate
      configurations, the b1 orbital on a first water oxygen will
      interact with the 1b2 orbital on an adjacent, second water
      molecule, which in turn will interact with the b1 orbital of a
      third adjacent water molecule, etc. As shown in FIG. 2, when
      successive water molecules are oriented perpendicular to one
      another (FIG. 2A), the b1 and 1b2 orbitals on alternating
      molecules can interact (see FIG. 2B) to form delocalized
      p.pi.-type orbitals that extend along any number of adjacent
      waters.<br>
      <br>
      Those of ordinary skill in the art will readily appreciate that
      the larger the number of water molecules that are interacting with
      one another, the more different combinations of b1 and 1b2
      orbitals will be created, each producing a p.pi. orbital with a
      particular extent of bonding or antibonding character. For
      example, FIG. 3 presents possible p.pi. orbitals produced by
      combinations of b1 and 1b2 orbitals on three water molecules; FIG.
      4 present possible p.pi. orbitals produced by combinations of b1
      and 1b2 orbitals on four water molecules. As can be seen, the
      larger the number of interacting water molecules, the larger the
      manifold of possible p.pi. orbitals.<br>
      <br>
      It will be appreciated that both the b1 and 1b2 orbitals in water
      are occupied. Accordingly, the oxygen-oxygen interactions
      described by the present invention involve interactions of filled
      orbitals. Traditional molecular orbital theory teaches that
      interactions between such filled orbitals typically do not occur
      because, due to repulsion between the electron pairs, the
      antibonding orbitals produced by the interaction are more
      destabilized than the bonding orbitals are stabilized. However, in
      the case of interacting oxygen atoms on adjacent water molecules,
      the interacting atoms are farther apart (about 2.8 .ANG., on
      average) than they would be if they were covalently bonded to one
      another. Thus, the electron-pair repulsion is weaker than it would
      otherwise be and such asymmetrical orbital splitting is not
      expected to occur. In fact, some "bonding" and "antibonding"
      orbital combinations can have substantially identical energies.
      The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) in water is,
      therefore, a manifold of substantially degenerate p.pi. orbitals
      with varying bonding and antibonding character; the lowest
      unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) in water represents a manifold
      of states corresponding to interactions involving 2b2 orbitals an
      adjacent water molecules.<br>
      <br>
      As described above, one aspect of the invention is the discovery
      that oxygen-oxygen interactions can occur among neighboring water
      molecules through overlap of b1 and 1b2 orbitals on adjacent
      oxygens that produces degenerate, delocalized p.pi. orbitals. A
      further aspect of the invention is the recognition that such p.pi.
      orbitals, if made to protrude from the surface of a water
      structure, can impart high reactivity to oxygens within that
      structure. The inventors draw an analogy between the presently
      described water oxygen p.pi. orbitals and d.pi. orbitals known to
      impart reactivity to certain chemical catalysts (see, for example
      Johnson, in The New World of Quantum Chemistry, ed. by Pullman et
      al., Reidel Publishing Co., Dorderecht-Holland, pp. 317-356, 1976.
      According to the present invention, water oxygens can be made to
      catalyze their own oxidative addition to other molecules by
      incorporating them into water structures in which p.pi. orbitals
      associated with oxygen-oxygen interactions protrude from the
      structure surface.<br>
      <br>
      A further aspect of the invention provides the recognition that
      reactivity of water oxygens within structures having protruding
      p.pi. orbitals can be enhanced through amplification of certain
      oxygen-oxygen vibrational modes. It is known that the rate
      limiting step associated with oxidative addition of an oxygen atom
      from O2 is the dissociation of the oxygen atom from the O2
      molecule. Thus, in general, oxygen reactivity can be enhanced by
      increasing the ease with which the oxygen can be removed from the
      molecule with which it is originally associated. The present
      inventors have recognized that enhancement of oxygen-oxygen
      vibrational modes in water clusters increases the probability that
      a particular oxygen atom will be located a distance from the rest
      of the structure. Where the oxygen is participating in
      interactions that create a protruding p.pi. orbital, displacement
      of the oxygen away from the structure increases the probability
      that the p.pi. orbital will have the opportunity to overlap with
      orbitals of a potential reaction partner, and therefore increases
      the reactivity of the oxygen atom. Essentially, the vibrations
      create an orbital steering effect.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention therefore provides "water clusters" that are
      characterized by high oxygen reactivity as a result of their
      orbital and vibrational characteristics. A "water cluster", as
      that term is used herein, describes any arrangement of water
      molecules that has sufficient "surface reactivity" due to
      protruding p.pi. orbitals that the reactivity of cluster oxygens
      with other reactants is enhanced relative to the reactivity of
      oxygens in liquid water. Accordingly, so long as a sufficient
      number of p.pi. orbitals protrude from the cluster of water
      molecules in a way that allows increased interaction with nearby
      reactants, the requirements of the present invention are
      satisfied.<br>
      <br>
      Preferred water clusters of the present invention have symmetry
      characteristics. Symmetry increases the degeneracy of the p.pi.
      orbitals and also produces more delocalized orbitals, thereby
      increasing the "surface reactivity" of the cluster. Symmetry also
      allows collective vibration of oxygen-oxygen interactions within
      the clusters, so that the likelihood that a protruding p.pi.
      orbital will have an opportunity to overlap with a potential
      reactant orbital is increased. Particularly preferred water
      clusters comprise pentagonal arrays of water molecules, and
      preferably comprise pentagonal arrays with maximum icosahedral
      symmetry. Most preferred clusters comprise pentagonal dodecahedral
      arrays of water molecules.<br>
      <br>
      Water clusters comprising pentagonal arrays of water molecules are
      preferred at least in part because of their vibrational modes that
      can contribute to enhanced oxygen reactivity are associated with
      the oxygen-oxygen "squashing" and "twisting" modes (depicted for a
      pentagonal dodecahedral water structure in FIG. 5). These modes
      have calculated vibrational frequencies that i.e. between the far
      infrared and microwave regions of the electromagnetic spectrum,
      within the range of approximately 250 cm@-1 to 5 cm@-1. Induction
      of such modes may be accomplished resonantly, for example through
      application of electrical, electromagnetic, and/or ultrasonic
      fields, or may be accomplished intrinsically through the dynamical
      Jahn-Teller effect.<br>
      <br>
      The DJT effect refers to a symmetry-breaking phenomenon in which
      molecular vibrations of appropriate frequency couple with certain
      degenerate energy states available to a molecule, so that those
      states are split away from the other states with which they used
      to be degenerate (for review, see Bersuker et al., Vibronic
      Interactions in Molecules and Crystals, Springer Verlag, N.Y.,
      1990). Thus, natural coupling between the oxygen-oxygen vibrations
      and the degenerate p.pi. molecular orbitals of water clusters of
      the present invention can enhance oxygen reactivity.<br>
      <br>
      Water clusters having pentagonal symmetry are particularly
      preferred because adjacent pentagonal clusters repel each other,
      importing kinetic energy to the clusters that can contribute to
      their increased reactivity.<br>
      <br>
      It will be appreciated that not all of the molecules in the water
      clusters of the present invention need be water molecules per se.
      For example, molecules (such as alcohols, amines, etc.) that
      represent a substitution of a water hydrogen can be incorporated
      into water clusters of the invention without disrupting the
      oxygen-oxygen interactions. Methonal, ethanol, or any other
      substantially saturated alcohol is suitable in this regard. Other
      atoms, ions, or molecules can additionally or alternatively be
      included in the structure so long as they don't interfere with
      protrusion of the interactive p.pi. orbital(s). The structures
      themselves may also be protonated or ionized. Given that not all
      of the molecules in the cluster need be water molecules, we herein
      describe certain desirable characteristics of inventive water
      clusters with reference to the number of oxygens in the cluster.<br>
      <br>
      Preferred water clusters of the present invention are
      "nanodroplets", preferably smaller than about 20 .ANG. in their
      longest dimension, and preferably comprising between about 5 and
      300 oxygens. Particularly preferred clusters include between about
      20 and 100 oxygens. Most preferred water clusters contain
      approximately 20 oxygens and have pentagonal dodecahedral
      symmetry.<br>
      <br>
      Particular embodiments of preferred inventive water clusters for
      use in the practice of the present invention are presented in
      FIGS. 6-12. FIG. 6 shows a 5-molecule water cluster with
      pentagonal symmetry, FIG. 7 shows one of the p.pi. orbitals
      associated with this cluster. Solid lines represent the positive
      phase of the orbital wave function; dashed lines represent the
      negative phase. As can be seen with reference to FIG. 7, a
      delocalized p.pi. orbital forms that protrudes from the surface of
      the cluster. This orbital (and others) is available for
      interaction with orbitals of neighboring reaction partners.
      Overlap with an orbital lobe of the same phase as the protruding
      p.pi. orbital lobe will create a bonding interaction between the
      relevant cluster oxygen and the reaction partner.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 8 shows a 10-molecule water cluster with partial pentagonal
      symmetry; FIG. 9 shows one of its delocalized p.pi. orbitals. As
      can be seen, the orbital delocalization (and protrusion) is
      primarily associated with the water molecules in the pentagonal
      arrangement. Thus, FIG. 9 demonstrates one of the advantages of
      high symmetry in the water clusters of the present invention: the
      p.pi. orbital associated with the pentagonally-arranged water
      molecules is more highly delocalized and protrudes more
      effectively from the surface. The orbital therefore creates
      surface reactivity not found with the oxygens in water molecules
      that are not part of the pentagonal array.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 10 shows a 20-molecule water cluster with pentagonal
      dodecahedral symmetry; FIG. 11, Panels A-E show various of its
      p.pi. orbitals. Once again, extensive orbital delocalization and
      surface protrusion is observed in this highly symmetrical
      structure. For comparison, an unoccupied antibonding orbital
      associated with the same structure is depicted in FIG. 12. Much
      less delocalization is observed.<br>
      <br>
      Water clusters comprising more than approximately 20 water
      molecules are not specifically depicted in Figures presented
      herein, but are nonetheless useful in the practice of the present
      invention. For example, clusters comprising approximately 80
      molecules can assume an ellipsoidal configuration with protruding
      p.pi. orbitals at the curved ends. When clusters comprise more
      than approximately 300 water molecules, however, the cluster tends
      to behave more like liquid water, which shows low "surface
      reactivity." Of course, if the cluster were to comprise a large
      number (&gt;300) of water molecules all arranged in stable
      symmetrical structures (e.g., several stable pentagonal
      dodecahedral), these problems would not be encountered. Such large
      clusters are therefore within the scope of the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      As has been mentioned, water clusters comprising pentagonal
      dodecahedral molecular arrangements are particularly preferred for
      use in the practice of the present invention. Accordingly,
      pentagonal dodecahedral water structures are discussed in more
      detail below. Those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate,
      however, that the following discussion is not intended to limit
      the scope of the present invention, and that any and all
      embodiments encompassed by the prior broad description fall within
      the scope of the claims.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Pentagonal Dodecahedral Water Clusters</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Pentagonal dodecahedral water structures (such as, for example,
      (H2 O)20, (H2 O)20@++, (H2 O)20 H@+, and (H2 O)21 H@+, and
      analogous structures including alcohol molecules) are particularly
      preferred for use in the practice of the present invention
      because, as shown in FIG. 11, delocalized p.pi. orbitals protrude
      from the dodecahedron vertices, so that all 20 oxygens in the
      structure are predicted to have enhanced reactivity. Furthermore,
      Coulomb repulsion between like-charged dodecahedra can render
      pentagonal dodecahedral structures kinetically energetic. Also,
      the symmetry of the structure produces degenerate molecular
      orbitals that can couple with oxygen-oxygen vibrational modes in
      the far infrared to microwave regions, resulting in increased
      reactivity of the structure oxygens. As discussed above, these
      modes can be induced through application of appropriate fields, or
      through the dynamical Jahn-Teller effect.<br>
      <br>
      It should be noted that pentagonal dodecahedral water structures
      had been produced and analyzed well before the development of the
      present invention. As early as 1973, researchers were reporting
      unexpected stabilities of water clusters of the form H@+ (H2 O)20
      and H@+ (H2 O)21 (see, for example, Lin, Rev. Sci. Instrum.
      44:516, 1973; Searcy et al., J. Chem. Phys. 61:5282, 1974; Holland
      et al., J. Chem. Phys. 72:11, 1980; Yang et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc.
      111:6845, 1989; Wei et al., J. Chem. Phys. 94:3268, 1991).
      However, prior art analyses of these structures centered around
      discussions of hydrogen bond interactions, and struggled to
      explain their structure and energetics (see, for example, Laasonen
      et al., J. Phys. Chem. 98:10079, 1994). No prior art reference
      discussed the oxygen-oxygen interactions described herein, and
      none recognized the increased reactivity of cluster oxygens.
      Moreover, no prior art reference recognized the desirability of
      inducing particular vibrational modes in these clusters in order
      to increase oxygen reactivity.<br>
      <br>
      On the other hand, certain elements of the data collected in prior
      art studies are consistent with and can be explained by the theory
      presented herein. For example, the present invention predicts that
      low-frequency vibrations attributable to oxygen-oxygen bonds at
      the vertices of pentagonal dodecahedral structures should be
      observable by Raman scattering. Several groups have reported low
      frequency Raman scattering in water (see, for example, Rousset et
      al., J. Chem. Phys. 92:2150, 1990; Majolino et al., Phys. Rev.
      E47:2669, 1993; Mizoguchi et al., J. Chem. Phys. 97:1961, 1992),
      but each has offered its own explanation for the effect, none of
      which involves vibrations of oxygen-oxygen bonds at the vertices
      of pentagonal dodecahedral structures. In fact, Sokolov et al.
      recently, summarized the state of understanding of the observed
      low frequency vibrations by saying "the description of the
      spectrum and its relation with the critical behavior of other
      properties are still not clear" (Sokolov et al., Phys. Rev. B
      51:12865, 1995). The present invention solves this problem.<br>
      <br>
      The analysis of water structure provided by the present invention
      explains several observations about water properties that cannot
      be understood through studies of hydrogen bond interactions. For
      example, Seete et al. (Phys. Rev. Lett 75:850, 1995) have reported
      propagation of "fast sound" through liquid water is not dependent
      on the hydrogen isotope employed. Accordingly, fast sound cannot
      be propagating only on the hydrogen network.<br>
      <br>
      According to the present invention, preferred pentagonal
      dodecahedral water structures include (H2 O)20, (H2 O)20@++, (H2
      O)20 H@+, and (H2 O)21 H@+. Also preferred are structures
      including one or more alcohol molecules substituted for water.
      Preferred structures may also include clathrated (or otherwise
      bonded) ions, atoms, molecules or other complex organic or
      metallo-organic ligands. In fact, clathration can act to stabilize
      pentagonal dodecahedral water structures. Preferred clathration
      structures include (H2 O)21 H@+ structures in which an H3 O@+
      molecule is clathrated within a pentagonal dodecahedral shell.
      Other preferred clathrated structures include those in which a
      metal ion is clathrated by pentagonal dodecahedral water.<br>
      <br>
      Water clusters containing stable pentagonal dodecahedral water
      structures may be produced in accordance with the present
      invention by any of a variety of methods. In liquid water,
      pentagonal dodecahedral structures probably form transiently, but
      are not stable. In fact, liquid water can be modeled as a
      collection of pentagonal dodecahedra in which inter-structure
      interactions are approximately as strong as, or stronger than,
      intra-structure interactions. Accordingly, in order to produce
      stable pentagonal dodecahedral water structures from liquid water,
      the long-range inter-structure interactions present in liquid
      water must be disrupted in favor of the intra-structure
      association. Any of a variety of methods, including physical,
      chemical, electrical, and electromagnetic methods, can be used to
      accomplish this. For example, perhaps the most straightforward
      method of isolating pentagonal dodecahedral water structures is
      simply to isolate 20 or 21 water molecules in a single
      nanodroplet. Preferred water clusters of the present invention
      comprise 20 to 21 water molecules.<br>
      <br>
      Other methods of producing pentagonal dodecahedral water
      structures include passing water vapor through a hypersonic
      nozzle, as is known in the art (see, for example Lin, Rev. Sci.
      Instrum. 44:516, 1973; Searcy et al., J. Chem. Phys. 61:5282,
      1974). All known methods of hypersonic nozzling are useful in
      accordance with the present invention. The present invention,
      however, also provides an improved hypersonic nozzling method for
      preparing pentagonal dodecahedral water structures. Specifically,
      in a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the hypersonic
      nozzle comprises a catalytic material such as nickel or a nickel
      alloy positioned and arranged so that, as water passes through the
      nozzle, it comes in contact with reacting orbitals on the
      catalytic material. Under such conditions, the catalytic material
      is expected to disrupt inter-cluster bonding, by sending electrons
      into anti-bonding orbitals, without interfering with intra-cluster
      bonding interactions.<br>
      <br>
      Chemical methods for producing water clusters comprising
      pentagonal dodecahedral structures include the use of surfactants
      and/or clathrating agents. Electrical methods include inducing
      electrical breakdown of inter-cluster interactions by providing an
      electrical spark of sufficient voltage and appropriate frequency.
      Electromagnetic methods include application of microwaves of
      appropriate frequency to interact with the "squashing" vibrational
      modes of inter-cluster oxygen-oxygen interactions. Also, since it
      is known that ultrasound waves can cavitate (produce bubbles in)
      water, it is expected that inter-cluster associations can be
      disrupted ultrasonically without interfering with intra-cluster
      interactions. Finally, various other methods have been reported
      for the production of pentagonal dodecahedral water structures as
      can be employed in the practice of the present invention. Such
      methods include ion bombardment of ice surfaces (Haberland, in
      Electronic and Atomic Collisions, ed. by Eichler et al., Elsevier,
      Ansterdam, pp. 597-604, 1984), electron impact ionization (Lin,
      Rev. Sci. Instrum. 44:516, 1973; Hermann et al., J. Chem. Phys.
      72:185, 1982; Dreyfuss et al., J. Chem. Phys. 76:2031, 1982; Stace
      et al., Chem. Phys. Lett. 96:80, 1983; Echt et al., Chem. Phys.
      Lett. 108:401, 1989), and near-threshold vacuum-UV photoionization
      of neutral clusters (Shinohara et al., Chem. Phys. 83:4183, 1985;
      Nagashima et al., J. Chem. Phys. 84:209, 1986)??].<br>
      <br>
      However the pentagonal dodecahedral water structures are initially
      produced, it may be desirable to ionize them (e.g., by passing
      them through an electrical potential after they are formed) in
      order to increase their kinetic energy, and therefore their
      reactivity, through coulombic repulsion.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Applications</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      As described above, the present invention provides water clusters
      that include reactive oxygens. The invention also provides methods
      of using such clusters, particularly in "oxidative" reactions
      (i.e., in reactions that involve transfer of an oxygen from one
      molecule to another). The clusters can be employed in any
      oxidative reaction, in combination with any appropriate reaction
      partner.<br>
      <br>
      One particularly useful application of the water structures of the
      present invention is in combustion. According to the present
      invention, the reactive water oxygens can efficiently combine with
      carbon in a fuel so that the specific energy of the combustion
      reaction is increased.<br>
      <br>
      In order to model the reactivity of water structure oxygens with
      neighboring carbons, the inventors have analyzed pentagonal
      dodecahedral clusters in water cluster/methanol and water
      cluster/ethanol mixtures. FIGS. 13 and 14 present calculated p.pi.
      orbitals for these structures. As can be seen with both
      structures, the depicted orbital has the same phase with respect
      to the carbon and its adjacent oxygen. By contrast, the orbital
      phase often shifts between the oxygen and neighboring hydrogens.
      Electron density between the carbon and oxygen is high.<br>
      <br>
      The structures depicted in FIGS. 3 and 14 model systems in which
      an isolated pentagonal dodecahedral water cluster is surrounded
      with hydrocarbon molecules. The high electron density between the
      cluster oxygen and adjacent carbon indicate that the likelihood
      that the oxygen will be oxidatively added to the carbon is
      increased. Thus, the present invention teaches that dispersions of
      water droplets in fuel should have enhanced specific energy of
      combustion as compared with fuel alone. Accordingly, one aspect of
      the present invention comprises combustible compositions
      comprising clusters dispersed in fuel. The compositions are
      designed to include water structures with reactive oxygens and to
      maximize interaction of the fuel with those oxygens.<br>
      <br>
      Fuels that can usefully be employed in the water cluster/fuel
      compositions of the present invention include any hydrocarbon
      source capable of interaction with reactive oxygens in water
      clusters of the present invention. Preferred fuels include
      gasoline and diesel. Diesel fuel is particularly preferred.<br>
      <br>
      Water cluster/fuel compositions of the present invention may be
      prepared by any means that allows formation of water clusters with
      reactive oxygens and exposes a sufficient number of such reactive
      oxygens to the fuel so that the specific energy of combustion is
      enhanced as compared to the specific energy observed when pure
      fuel is combusted under the same conditions. Preferably, stable
      water structures that contain reactive oxygens are prepared prior
      to introduction of the water into the water cluster/fuel
      compositions. Surfactants may be employed to stabilize the water
      cluster/fuel compositions if desired.<br>
      <br>
      In order that the fuel in the water cluster/fuel compositions of
      the present invention be exposed to the maximum number of reactive
      oxygens, it is desirable to minimize the size of the water
      clusters in the water cluster/fuel compositions. Preferably, the
      water clusters have an average diameter of no more than about 20
      .ANG. along their longest dimension. More preferably, each droplet
      comprises less than about 300 water molecules. In particularly
      preferred embodiments, the water/cluster fuel composition
      comprises individual pentagonal dodecahedral water clusters are
      dispersed within the fuel.<br>
      <br>
      It will be appreciated that the extent of interaction between the
      hydrocarbon fuel and reactive oxygens in the water will depend not
      only on the size (and surface reactivity) of the water clusters in
      the composition, but also on the number of water clusters
      dispersed within the fuel. Preferred water cluster/fuel
      compositions contain at least about 5% water, preferably at least
      about 20-30%. Particularly preferred water cluster/fuel
      compositions contain at least about 50% water.<br>
      <br>
      As mentioned above, the water cluster/fuel compositions of the
      present invention are preferably prepared so that the specific
      energy of combustion is higher than that of pure fuel. Preferably,
      the specific energy is increased at least about 1-2%, more
      preferably at least about 10%, still more preferably at least
      about 15-20%, and most preferably at least about 50%.<br>
      <br>
      As described in Example 1, we have prepared various water
      cluster/fuel emulsions and have tested their combustive properties
      in a standard diesel engine, under normal operating conditions.
      FIG. 16 presents emission data compiled from combustion of these
      emulsions, and reveals that NOx and particulate emissions are
      reduced upon combustion of the inventive emulsions; CO levels may
      be increased.<br>
      <br>
      The water phase of the inventive emulsions described in Example 1
      had a particle size of about 4-7 .ANG.. Moreover, the phase was
      shown to include inventive water clusters, characterized by
      oxygen-oxygen vibrational modes. Specifically, an isotope effect
      was observed in the region of about 100-150 cm@-1 of the Raman
      spectra of emulsions containing H2 O@18 (see FIG. 15). This effect
      reveals that vibrations including oxygens are responsible for the
      spectral lines observed in that region.<br>
      <br>
      The results presented in FIG. 16 were achieved by combusting
      diesel or water cluster/diesel emulsions in a standard diesel
      engine. The present invention can therefore readily be implemented
      with existing technology. However, an additional aspect of the
      invention involves altering the design of engines used in
      combustion of water cluster/fuel compositions of the present
      invention.<br>
      <br>
      One embodiment of an altered engine for use in the practice of the
      present invention is a derivative of standard diesel engine,
      altered so as not to have a functional air intake valve. Given
      that the oxygen used in combustion of the inventive water
      cluster/fuel compositions can come from the water instead of from
      air, air intake should not be required.<br>
      <br>
      More dramatic changes in engine design are also envisioned. For
      example, FIG. 17 presents one embodiment of a new engine for
      combusting water cluster/fuel compositions of the present
      invention. As shown, water clusters 100 are injected into a
      chamber 200, into which fuel 300 is also injected. The water
      clusters may be prepared by any of the means described above, but
      preferably are prepared by ejection from a hypersonic nozzle. In
      preferred embodiments, the nozzle comprises a catalytic material.
      In some embodiments, the clusters are also ionized by passage
      through a potential.<br>
      <br>
      As has been discussed herein, it is desirable to expose the fuel
      to the water clusters in a way that maximizes interaction between
      fuel carbons and water oxygens. Because pentagonal dodecahedral
      water structures have high surface reactivity particularly
      preferred embodiments of the invention inject individual
      pentagonal dodecahedral water structures into the chamber. One
      additional advantage of injecting water clusters into a chamber,
      and particularly of injecting individual pentagonal dodecahedral
      water structures, is that it allows the Coulombic repulsion
      between individual water clusters to be harnessed as kinetic
      energy, thereby increasing the energy available for conversion
      during combustion.<br>
      <br>
      Once inside the chamber, the water cluster/fuel composition is
      ignited according to standard procedures. As mentioned above, air
      intake is not required.<br>
      <br>
      Those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that many of
      the known variations to engine structure and combustion conditions
      may be incorporated into the present invention. For example,
      various additives may be included in the water cluster/fuel
      composition in order to improve combustibility, stability,
      lubricity or other desirable characteristics.<br>

      <b>Example 1</b><b><br>
      </b><b>Preparation and Analysis of Combustible Water Cluster/Fuel
        Emulsions</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Water cluster/fuel emulsions were prepared according to the
      following method:<br>
      <br>
      COMPONENT AMNT/GALLON EMULSION<br>
      <br>
      Diesel 0.55 Gal<br>

      0.27 lb<br>
      Surfactant III<br>
      0.10 Gal<br>
      <br>
      The water can be distilled water or tap water, or a mixture of
      water and a short chain alcohol such as methanol. Surfactant I has
      the structure Cx H20 (OCH2 CH2)y OH, where x=8-10 and y=4-10.
      Surfactant II is a polyglyceril-oleate or cocoate. Surfactant III
      is a short chain, (C2-8) linear alcohol.<br>
      <br>
      The emulsions were prepared by mixing the Diesel with Surfactant I
      and II. Water and surfactant III were then added simultaneously.
      The water nanodroplets in the emulsion had a grain size of about
      4-7 .ANG.. Two particular formulations were prepared that had the
      following components:<br>
      <br>
      Component Amount (g)<br>
      <br>
      Formulation 1<br>

      <br>
      Raman spectra of Formulation 2, were taken using laser excitation
      at both 406.7 nm and 647.1 nm. The spectra at 406.7 nm were highly
      fluorescent and only anti-stokes scattering/emission was carefully
      examined. The results at 647.1 nm did not have these problems.
      Isotope shift experiments were performed by introducing H2 O@18
      into the emulsions. The H2 O/H2 O@18 difference spectrum is
      presented as FIG. 15. As can be seen, a peak was observed around
      100-150 cm@-1, in the region associated with oxygen-oxygen
      squashing vibrational modes. Accordingly, it was concluded that
      the Formulation 2 emulsion contained water clusters having at
      least pentagonal symmetry.<br>
      <br>
      The water cluster/fuel emulsions were weighed and then were pumped
      into a small YANMAR diesel engine. Energy output, injection
      timing, and engine operation were monitored according to standard
      techniques. Exhaust samples were taken and emissions were analyzed
      also according to standard techniques.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 16 presents the results of emissions analysis of two water
      cluster/fuel emulsions, Formulation 1 and Formulation 2. As can be

      </b><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0001] Much of the cosmetic industry has been and continues to be
      focused on the development of effective skin moisturizers to help
      overcome the skin hydration barrier. However, the typical cosmetic
      moisturizing formulation uses oil formulations to deliver various
      active ingredients, with water present as a non-active ingredient
      carrier, which typically evaporates from the skin surface<br>
      <br>
      [0002] The pharmaceutical industry has likewise devoted a
      significant part of its resources toward the development of drugs
      that can be delivered transdermally for the treatment of
      afflictions ranging from skin disorders to bodily disease.
      Transdermal drug delivery systems provide for the controlled
      release of drugs directly into the bloodstream through intact
      skin. Transdermal drug delivery is an attractive alternative that
      can be used often when oral drug treatment is not possible or
      desirable. In particular, with transdermal administration long
      duration of action and controlled activity is achieved.<br>
      <br>
      [0003] Industry is continually seeking to develop more effective
      applications of beneficial formulations to the skin.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0004] The present invention provides water nanocluster/oil (W/O)
      formulations and methods for delivering water nanoclusters to the
      skin. In one aspect, the invention provides a process for the
      delivery of water nanoclusters through the outermost layer of
      human skin by preparing a water nanocluster composition comprising
      water nanoclusters having a least one dimension between about 0.5
      and 10.0 nanometers (about 5-100 Angstroms) and an oil formulation
      as a W/O emulsion, and applying said water nanocluster composition
      onto the outermost layer of human skin.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] The present invention also provides a water nanocluster/oil
      W/O emulsion composition comprised of (1) about 5 to 50% by weight
      water containing water nanoclusters having at least one dimension
      between about 0.5 and 10.0 nanometers (about 5-100 Angstroms), and
      preferably less than about 1.0 nanometer, (2) about 5 to 50% by
      weight of one or more surfactants selected from the group
      consisting of fatty acids, ethoxylates and alcohols, and (3) about
      10 to 90% by weight being oils, including other beneficial
      ingredients.<br>

      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      [0016] Water clusters of the type used in the present invention
      are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,800,576 and 5,997,590, both of
      which are incorporated herein by reference. The specific
      formulations described therein are waterclusters/fuel emulsions,
      but the teaching of the form of the water cluster components
      (e.g., see columns 1-14 and FIGS. 1-10 of U.S. Pat. No. 5,997,590)
      are the same as those water clusters useful in this invention. The
      water clusters are preferably concatenated pentagonal water
      clusters like that shown in FIG. 12 of U.S. Pat. No. 5,800,576 and
      are comprised of twenty-one or fewer water molecules and having at
      least one dimension of 8A (0.8 nm) or less. For example,
      individual water clusters in dodecahedral form are essentially
      spherical in shape and have a diameter of about 0.8 nanometer (see
      FIG. 2); those in pentagonal form are puckered rings and have a
      diameter of about 0.5 nanometer (see FIG. 1).<br>
      <br>
      [0017] The water clusters can be present as individual water
      cluster units and/or as an array of aggregated water cluster
      units. The pentagonal water cluster shown FIG. 2 and the
      dodecahedral water cluster shown in FIG. 1 are examples of
      individual water clusters. FIG. 7 shows an array of five
      dodecahedral water clusters in a needle-like array. One dimension
      of the array of water clusters is less than about one nanometer
      (10 Angstroms), with the length of the array being about 3
      nanometers (about 30 Angstroms) (see FIG. 7).<br>
      <br>
      [0018] The type and size of the individual water clusters, as well
      as the degree and type of aggregation thereof, will and may vary
      in a given water cluster formulation of this invention. For
      example, a given composition of this invention may contain
      individual pentagonal and pentagonal dodecahedral water clusters,
      some of which may be in the form of multi-cluster arrays, e.g.,
      needle-like arrays like that shown in FIG. 7. Regardless of the
      water cluster type, size and degree of aggregation, one dimension
      of the water cluster or array thereof, about 10.0 nanometers (100
      Angstroms), preferably less than about one nanometer (10
      Angstroms), most preferably less than or equal to about 0.8
      nanometer (8 Angstroms).<br>
      <br>
      [0019] All of the water which is present need not be in the form
      of water clusters. Some of the water may be present in traditional
      bulk water form (i.e., in the form of globules larger than 10
      nanometers or 100 Angstroms in diameter, which exhibit all the
      physical characteristics of bulk water). Since the benefits of the
      present invention are attributed to the presence of the water
      clusters, it is preferred that a substantial (most preferably
      greater than 50%) portion of the water present be in the water
      cluster form.<br>
      <br>
      [0020] The water nanoclusters of the present invention can be
      produced by a variety of means as taught in the aforesaid
      referenced patents (e.g., see columns 9-10 of U.S. Pat. No.
      5,997,590). However, for purposes of this invention, use of
      surfactants to produce the desired nanoemulsion (as described
      below) is most preferred.<br>
      <br>
      [0021] The oil formulations useful herein include for cosmetic
      applications: cosmetic industry oils such as soybean, peanut,
      olive, sesame and paraffin. Suitable cosmetic oil formulation may
      also include any of a variety of additives useful or
      non-deleterious in a cosmetic product, such as oil soluble
      vitamins and other cosmetic nutrients (e.g., Vitamin E),
      fragrances and other active (e.g., sunscreens) or inert additives,
      which are preferably soluble in the oil.<br>
      <br>
      [0022] The preferred oil formulation for pharmaceutical
      applications is light mineral oil. This oil is used to produce
      pharmaceutical formulations useful herein, which include
      pharmaceutical ingredients, such as FDA-approved dermatological
      drugs and vitamin supplements of all types, which are soluble at
      to a reasonable degree in the oil and/or water nanoclusters.
      Preferred examples of pharmaceutical ingredients that made be
      included in the inventive compositions and processes include the
      topical delivery of Vitamins C and E, which may be for example
      used to prevent or reverse skin damage due to sun exposure or
      aging. Vitamin C, soluble (clathrated) in the water nanoclusters,
      stimulates the production of collagen in the skin and functions as
      an antioxidant along with the antioxidant property of the water
      nanoclusters. Vitamin E, soluble in the oil, functions along with
      the water nanoclusters as antioxidant scavenger of cell-damaging
      free radicals, and the present invention provides for effective
      delivery thereof to the skin. Additional or alternative preferred
      pharmaceutical ingredients include FDA-approved transdermally
      deliverable "classic" drugs such as hormonally active
      testosterone, progesterone, and estradiol, glycyril trinitrate
      (e.g., for treatment of angina), hyoscine (e.g., for seasickness),
      nicotine (e.g., for smoking cessation); prostaglandin E1 (e.g.,
      for treatment of erectile dysfunction); proteins and peptides; DNA
      and oligonucleotides (e.g., for gene therapy; DNA vaccines).<br>
      <br>
      [0023] The types of suitable surfactants include fatty acids,
      ethoxylates and long chain alcohols. Short chain alcohols are also
      used as cosurfactants. A preferred surfactant has a polar end
      (typically a carboxyl COOH group) which attaches. itself to a
      water cluster. Preferably, the surfactant also has at least one
      long (preferably 6-20 carbons) linear or branched hydrophobic
      "tail" that is soluble in the cosmetic oil. The surfactants are
      preferably present in the up to 50% by weight range.<br>
      <br>
      [0024] Preferred fatty acids include hydrolysis products of edible
      oils, e.g., soybean or Canola oil. These materials consist mainly
      of oleic and linoleic acid. Purified cuts of these containing
      larger amounts of these acids can also be used. Fatty acids are
      examples of anionic surfactants. Anionic surfactants are known to
      penetrate and interact strongly with skin (P. Morganti et al., J.
      Appl. Cosmetol. 8, 23, 1990; 12, 25-30, 1994). Most anionic
      surfactants can induce swelling of the stratum corneum and the
      viable epidermis (P. Morganti et al., Int. J. Cosmet. Sci. 5, 7,
      1983; M. Chvapil and Z. Eckmayer, Int. J. Cosmet. Sci. 7,41-49,
      1985). It has been suggested that in conventional cosmetics, the
      hydrophobic interaction of the alkyl chains with the substrate
      leaves the negative end group of the surfactant exposed, creating
      additional anionic sites of the skin membrane (P. Morganti et al.,
      Int. J. Cosmet. Sci. 5, 7, 1983). However, our preferred water
      clusters in cosmetic formulations bind the negative end group of
      the surfactant, reducing or eliminating any skin-irritating
      effects while actually increasing the hydration level of the
      tissue.<br>
      <br>
      [0025] Some cationic surfactants in skin formulations are more
      irritating to the skin than the anionics and generally would be
      less suitable for stabilizing water-cluster nanoemulsions.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] Nonionic surfactants have the smallest potential for
      producing skin irritation. In conventional cosmetic
      microemulsions, they seem to have the ability to partition into
      the intercellular lipid phases of the stratum corneum, leading to
      increased "fluidity" in this region. Water-cluster cosmetic
      nanoemulsions stabilized by nonionic surfactants or a mixture of
      nonionics and anionics are the preferred compositions.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] Ionic surfactants generally have an advantage over nonionic
      surfactants in being more effective in stabilizing a given amount
      of water. In addition, they are far more resistant to emulsion
      breaking at elevated temperature than nonionics. Nonionics
      maintain themselves at the interface because the polar groups (e.
      g., -OH) hydrogen bond with water. However, the hydrogen bond is a
      weak bond (e.g., about 5 Kcal/mol) and becomes less effective as
      temperature rises above ambient.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] Fatty acids are effective detergents but only when at least
      partially neutralized. Frequently ammonia or organic bases are
      used to neutralize fatty acids. Ammonia can be an effective
      neutralizing agent, but is a very weak base and will serve to
      neutralize only a fraction of the carboxylate, which is also a
      weak acid.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] Amines are effective organic bases. Common amines are the
      lower alkanol amines, such as monoethanol amine (MEA), isopropanol
      amine and 2-butanol amine. Also common are the lower alkyl amines.
      There is a degree of neutralization significantly less than 100%
      for carboxylic acid surfactants which is optimum for solubilizing
      the maximum ratio of water to surfactant.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] A common nonionic surfactant class useful herein is
      ethoxylates. Theses are formed by reacting a mole of alcohol or
      amine with a number of moles of ethylene oxide (EO). The alcohol
      or amine generally contains a significant sized hydrocarbon group,
      for example, an akylated phenol or a long chain (C10-C20) alkyl
      group. Alcohols frequently used are nonyl phenol and lauryl
      alcohol. The hydrocarbon group serves as the nonpolar section of
      the molecule. The alcohol can be a can have more than one -OH
      group and the amine more than one -H, so several ethoxy chains can
      be present on one molecule. However these multichain ethoxy
      compounds don't usually function well as surfactants because they
      do not easily orient at the interface and pack poorly. The balance
      between hydrophobicity and hydrophylicity is obtained by choosing
      the hydrocarbon group and the average number of ethylene oxides
      added. Commonly 3-5 moles of EO are added per mole alcohol or
      amine.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] Another common class of nonionic surfactants useful herein
      is long chain (C10-C20) alcohols. These are frequently derived
      from hydrogenation of fatty acids, e.g., myristyl alcohol from
      myristic acid. Another source is ethylene oligomerization.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] Microemulsions may include a "cosurfactant" (e.g.,
      n-pentanol), which is not in itself a surfactant (i.e., a material
      that can not be used as the sole surfactant, but which may be
      included to improve the functioning of the material which per se
      can be used herein as a surfactant). Use of co-solvents is
      theorized to lower the interfacial tension and reduce dramatically
      the surfactant requirement. Other co-solvents included n-butanol,
      n-hexanol, 2 methyl 1-pentanol, 2 methyl 1-hexanol and 2 ethyl
      1-hexanol.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] One skilled in the art would readily be able to select the
      amount and type of surfactant to form the desired water clusters,
      while taking account other considerations (e.g., skin irritation
      potential) which may be associated with a particular
      surfactant(s).<br>
      <br>
      [0034] The water cluster/surfactant(s) will be present in the oil
      as a water-in-oil (W/O) emulsion. The W/O emulsions will be
      comprise of the water clusters (individual or arrays thereof in
      the forms, shapes and dimensions described above) with surfactants
      molecules attached thereto. As shown in FIGS. 2 &amp; 3, the
      single dodecahredral water cluster with fatty-acid surfactant
      would exist as a W/O emulsion in the cosmetic oil. The water
      cluster itself is spherical and has a diameter of about 0.8
      nanometer (8 Angstroms), with the surfactant molecule extending
      from the cluster, resulting in a W/O reverse micelle of about 3
      nanometers (30 Angstroms) in diameter. As shown in FIGS. 7 &amp;
      8, a five-dodecahedral water cluster needle-like array with
      fatty-acid surfactant would also exist as a W/O emulsion in the
      cosmetic oil. The water cluster array itself is needle-like and
      has one dimension of about 0.8 nanometer an a length of about 3
      nanometers, with the surfactant molecule linearly clathrated in
      the needle cavity, resulting in a cylindrically symmetric W/O
      micelle of about 4 nanometers. (40 Angstroms) in its largest
      dimension and about 0.8 nanometers (8 Angstroms) in its smallest
      dimension<br>
      <br>
      [0035] Preferred concentrations of water by weight are about 5-50%
      with the surfactant concentration (typically one surfactant
      molecule per water cluster) chosen to maximize the presence of
      water clusters between about 0.5 and 10 nanometers (about 5-100A),
      and preferably water clusters about 0.8 nm (about 8A) size in the
      formulation, to minimize separation of water and oil phases prior
      to application, thereby ensuring long shelf life.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0036] Application of Water Nanoclusters to the Skin</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0037] The present invention provides a process for delivery of
      water nanoclusters through the outmost layer of skin. First, a
      water nanocluster composition comprising water nanoclusters having
      diameters between 0.5 and ten nanometers (5-100A) and preferably
      water clusters of diameter less than one nanometer (10A) and an
      oil formulation is prepared. The water nanocluster composition is
      then applied preferably to the outermost layer of human skin.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] The skin as a physiological regulator plays a key role in
      the general metabolism of water in the body. Thus the moisture
      level of the outermost layer of the skin, the stratum corneum, is
      critical to maintaining the skin surface healthy and supple. Yet
      the stratum corneum is believed to be mainly responsible for the
      rate limiting of skin moisture permeation through the hydrophobic
      barrier presented by its intercellular lipids (H. Schaefer et al.,
      in Novel Cosmetic Delivery Systems, S. Magdassi and E. Touitou,
      Eds., Marcel Dekker, New York, 1999, pp. 949).<br>
      <br>
      [0039] First-principles quantum-chemistry computations of the
      electronic structure and low-frequency vibrational modes of water
      nanoclusters discussed herein, suggest that the permeating
      clusters will (1) clathrate and deactivate lipid hydrophobes
      responsible for the stratum corneum hydration barrier, (2)
      chemically scavenge free radicals that otherwise damage and age
      epidermal cells, (3) enhance the transdermal delivery of
      ingredients and (4) be subject to less water evaporation on the
      skin surface because of the intrinsic stability of the water
      nanoclusters.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] The present invention provides a process and formulation
      which is capable of providing an effective (1) skin moisturizer,
      (2) anti-oxidant capable of reducing cell damage and ageing and
      (3) a mechanism for the delivery of beneficial cosmetic and/or
      pharmaceutical ingredients to the skin.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] The skin moisturizer benefits are provided due to the
      present invention's unique capability of effectively overcoming
      the skin hydration barrier. First, the preferred water clusters of
      these this invention are less than the 10A (1 nm) size
      characteristic of the hydrophobic lipid intermolecular spacing and
      pore diameter of human skin, which enables physical penetration.
      Second, these water clusters have the unique capability of
      enclosing or "clathrating" lipid hydrophobes, which thereby
      counteract the hydrophobic effects of the lipid hydrophobes. This
      is exemplified in FIG. 3 for a pentagonal dodecahedral water
      cluster clathrating the end of a typical fatty acid lipid.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] The antioxidant benefits include chemically scavenging free
      radicals that otherwise damage and age epidermal cells. These
      benefits are obtained from the functionality of these water
      clusters after the formulation containing them has been applied to
      the skin and effectively penetrate the to the outermost layer of
      human skin. After such penetration has occurred, these water
      clusters further serve as active antioxidants for scavenging
      cell-damaging free radicals. Providing anti-oxidarits, such as
      Vitamin E, to the human body by ingestion and dermal penetration
      has been a matter of considerable technical and commercial focus.
      Vitamin E antioxidant function is believed to be associated with
      its ability to donate electrons to cell-destroying free radicals
      via the p[pi] molecular electron orbitals located on the carbon
      ring moiety at one end of the molecule, as shown in FIG. 6.
      Without being limited to the theoretical explanation thereof, it
      is believed that the antioxidant functionality of the water
      cluster formulations of this invention is generally&lt;1&gt;
      similar to that of Vitamin E but is based upon the
      electron-donating power of the unique water-cluster surface p[pi]
      molecular electron orbitals, coupled with the low-frequency
      water-cluster breathing vibrational modes through the dynamic
      Jahn-Teller effect. As shown in FIGS. 5 &amp; 9, the unique
      water-cluster surface p[pi] electron-donating molecular orbitals
      are qualitatively similar to the p[pi] molecular electron orbitals
      located on the carbon ring moiety at one end of the Vitamin E
      molecule shown in FIG. 6.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] Individual pentagonal or needle-like arrays of pentagonal
      dodecahedral clusters like the ones shown in FIGS. 2 &amp; 7
      holding an extra electron donated by the surfactant (FIGS. 3 &amp;
      10) are potentially powerful antioxidants equal to or better than
      Vitamin E because of the effectively large reactive cross sections
      of the cluster surface delocalized oxygen p[pi] orbitals mapped in
      FIGS. 5 &amp; 9. As shown in FIGS. 5 &amp; 9, these water clusters
      can function as electron reservoirs for chemical reactions
      involving electron transfer to the reacting species. Thus
      water-cluster hydrated-electron delocalized orbitals, originating
      on the cluster surface oxygen atoms, can readily overlap with and
      scavenge cell-damaging free radicals.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] Small polyhedral clusters of water molecules, especially
      quasiplanar and concatenated pentagonal water clusters (e.g. FIGS.
      1 &amp; 2), have been experimentally identified as being key to
      the hydration and stabilization of biomolecules (M. M. Teeter,
      Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 81, 6014. 1984), proteins (T. Baker et al.,
      in Crystallography in Molecular Biology, D. Moras et al., Eds.,
      Plenum, New York, 1985, pp 179-192), DNA (L. A. Lipscomb etal.,
      Biochemistry 33, 3649, 1994), and DNA-drug complexes (S. Neidle,
      Nature 288, 129, 1980). Such examples indicate the tendency of
      water pentagons to form closed geometrical structures like the
      pentagonal dodecahedra shown in FIGS. 1 and 2. It has also been
      suggested that such water clusters may play a fundamental role in
      determining biological cell architecture (J. G. Watterson, Molec.
      And Cell. Biochem. 79, 101, 1988). Approximately 70 percent of the
      human body is water by weight. Much of that water is believed not
      to be ordinary bulk liquid, but instead, nanoclustered,
      restructured water which affects biomolecular processes ranging
      from protein stability to enzyme activity (J. L. Finney, Water and
      Aqueous Solutions, G. W. Nelson and J. E. Enderby. Eds., Adam
      Hilger, Bristol, 1986, pp. 227-244).<br>

      [0072] Most preferably the water nanocluster compositions of this
      invention are stable (i.e.; they are thermodynamically stable) in
      the form of water-in-oil (W/O) nanocluster emulsion for extended
      periods, most preferably, for months or years after they are
      formulated). Although an oil and water emulsion can be made by
      various mixing techniques and/or through the use of other
      surfactants, such emulsions are typically either oil-in-water
      (O/W) emulsions (i.e.; not W/O emulsions) and/or are not stable
      (e.g.; significant phase separation occurs immediately or within
      hours or several days after preparation). In accordance with the
      present invention, highly stable (e.g.; which remain stable for
      24-36 months) water-in-oil nanocluster emulsion for cosmetic
      applications are provided through the use of surfactants selected
      from the group consisting of fatty acid and fatty acid amides,
      most particularly when the cosmetic oils and the surfactant are
      mixed prior to the addition of the water, as shown below in
      Examples 9 and 10.<br>
      <br>
      [0073] As discussed hereinabove, a preferred surfactant has a
      polar end (typically a carboxyl COOH group) which attaches itself
      to a water cluster and the surfactant also has at least one long
      (preferably 6-20 carbons) linear or branched hydrophobic "tail"
      that is soluble in the cosmetic oil. Fatty acid amides are most
      preferred including the simple fatty acid amides (having the
      formula R-CO-NH2), which result from the replacement of the
      hydroxyl of the carboxyl group with an amino group and fatty acid
      alkanolamides (having the formula R-CO-NH-CH2-CH2-OH), typically
      derived from fatty acids (e.g.; coconut oil) and alkanolamines.
      Among the most preferred fatty acid amides are Tallamide
      diethanolamine (DEA) and Cocamide DEA obtainable from McIntyre
      Group, Ltd., University Park, Il.60466, under the trade names
      Mackamide TD and Mackamide C-5, respectively. These surfactants,
      when used in the preparation of water nanocluster compositions of
      this invention, by mixing mineral (cosmetic) oil and the
      surfactant prior to the addition of the water, form water-in-oil
      nanocluster emulsion form for extended periods which remain stable
      essentially.<br>
      <br>
      [0074] Additional materials such as PPG-3 Myristyl Ether, may also
      be used to enhance the mixing of the surfactant and the oil.
      However, the most important mixing benefit is obtained by the
      order of mixing (i.e.; mixing the cosmetic oil and surfactant
      prior to the addition of the water components).<br>
      <br>
      [0075] As noted above, one skilled in the art would readily be
      able to select the amount and type of surfactant to form the
      desired water clusters, while taking account other considerations
      (e.g.; skin irritation potential) which may be associated with a
      particular surfactant(s) as well as avoiding the use of other
      ingredients, which may be unsuitable or limit the intended
      end-use. For example, although a variety of surfactants are noted
      in the preparation of nanoemulsions discussed in U.S. Pat. Nos.
      5,800,576 and 5,997,590 and suitably form nano-emulsions with the
      diesel oils and other fuels oils for the combustion-related uses
      therein, such surfactants may not necessarily form the stable
      water nanocluster compositions of the cosmetic and pharmaceutical
      oils in the present invention (because of the inherent differences
      in these types of oils) and/or the hazardous properties of these
      oils. Further, although trimethylpentane may have been considered
      as a potential cosmetic in some applications, due to its hazardous
      properties, including skin contact hazards, such materials are not
      considered to cosmetic oils as the term is used herein.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 9</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0076] An preferred water nanocluster compositions of this
      invention is prepared by mixing the following ingredients in the
      specified approximate weight percentages:<br>
      <br>
      Mineral Oil&nbsp; 65.8%<br>
      Tallamide DEA&nbsp; 11.3%<br>
      Distilled Water&nbsp; 22.9%<br>
      <br>
      [0077] The mixing procedure involves adding the components in the
      order indicated above, with the oil/surfactant components premixed
      with a little stirring prior to the addition of the distilled
      water. Thick whitish tendrils are formed as the water is added
      drop wise into the oil/surfactant mixture. After a little stirring
      and a few seconds time, the final blend clarifies, indicative of
      the formation of a water-in-oil (W/O) nanoemulsion. The
      formulation at this point is a pale yellowish liquid of medium
      viscosity, with a very slight haze. This product is non-irritating
      to skin and remains a stable nanoemulsion for over 36 months.<br>
      <br>
      [0078] Dynamic light-scattering measurements of the nanoemulsions
      indicate water-micelles between one and six nanometers (10-60
      Angstroms) in diameter. Adding more water to the above mixture to
      a total of approximately 30% water, the mixture becomes whitish,
      with a tendency to thicken over time. At 40% water, a creamy white
      emulsion is obtained, similar to a traditional hand lotion in
      consistency and appearance. Continuing to add water stepwise
      (about 5% at a time) up to 75% water produces a lotion-like
      product that is stable. This procedure requires no mechanical
      mixing whatsoever or application of heat, as is the case for
      commercial production of cosmetics "pre-mixes", and therefore is a
      major cost-saving method of making cosmetic lotions.<br>

      </b><br>
      [0079] Another preferred water nanocluster compositions of this

      except that a mixture of Tallamide DEA and Cocamide DEA is used as
      the surfactants, with the percentages being 8.0 wgt % and 3.3 wgt.
      % respectfully, instead of using 11.30 wgt. % of Tallamide DEA
      alone. A water-in-oil (W/O) nanoemulsion, which is essentially
      identical to that of EXAPLE 9 is formed and has essentially
      identical properties and characteristics.<br>

      </b><br>
      The long-range order in n-hexane, gasoline, diesel and in their
      mixtures with/without water is investigated by the gravitational
      mass spectroscopy (GMS). Molecular clusters are analyzed to be
      present in fuels and mixtures. Using GMS subtraction spectra for
      water in hydrocarbons, it becomes clear what role water plays and
      how it interact with the surroundings. Water in fuels is concluded
      to appear as individual clusters, whose structure (density)
      depends on the nature of hydrocarbon clusters. The combustion
      mechanism of hydrocarbons saturated with water will be discussed.
      Water clusters are suggested to accelerate the diffusion processes
      of the combustion. Molecular clusters in liquid fuels are formed
      in stationary gravitational waves of white noises, penetrating the
      Earth. <br>
