      Russian scientists developed a technique for converting energy
      from static electricity into electricity, which is commonly used
      in everyday life.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
      For this purpose researchers used the so-called “<span
        style="font-weight: bold;">Chizhevsky chandelier</span>”, which
      produces static electricity from air. A metal plate accumulated
      particle flow from the chandelier and forwarded it to an
      accumulating unit through wire. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Output











        electricity was 40 V</span>, but scientists claim they can get
      more if they need to.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
      Moreover, reseachers suggest abandoning gasoline, since cars can
      receive energy for moving from emitting wire, embedded directly
      into roadbed. Scientists developed similar technology even for air
      vehicles. Mentioned techniques are patented according legal
      regulations of the Russian Federation.<br>

      This device basically ministers for normalization, restoration of
      a tonus of an organism, but can be used and for more broad circle
      of medical problems. The mode of functioning is based on use of
      natural atmospheric electricity. It is known, that in a ground
      atmospheric slice there is an electrical gradient of voltage
      stresses, in the standard equal hundred - hundred thirty volt per
      meter altitudes.<br>
      <br>
      The joint current of escape is peer all atmosphere one and a half
      - two thousand amperes. On each person, the area taken by it, it
      is necessary about ten in a minus of the fourteenth degree of
      amperes.<br>
      <br>
      This current has modulation, in the standard 7 - 13 hz. And the
      same frequency the alpha has a rhythm of a cerebral cortex, with
      the same frequency oscillate&nbsp; bronchuses, the same frequency
      oscillations of mitochondrions - " power stations " have cells.<br>
      <br>
      In connection with these not accidental coincidences, I had idea
      of use of atmospheric electricity. It is necessary to say, that
      the atmospheric current has though also nonzero, but nevertheless
      scanty value, therefore to speak more correctly, that I used not
      an atmospheric current, and its information to a component.<br>
      <br>
      And so, above a head of the patient there is "corona" - convolute
      in a ring, a strip of silvered refined copper serrated from below.
      The corona is connected with exhibited on street, as a same strip
      of copper serrated, from above, linear, not convolute in a ring.
      This antenna is located at the altitude 10 - 15 meters above
      ground. Under legs of the patient, under a cord rug, earthed "star
      wheel" from the same copper is located. Between "corona" and "star
      wheel" the pile will be derivated is natural - modulated an
      electric field having major electric potential, but scanty current
      density.<br>
      <br>
      the Collateral effect - will be derivated some of useful aeroions
      for health, i.e. effect, similar « Chizhevsky chandelier », but is
      more weak, and distinguished that, that the natural modulation
      promoting a release phenomenon, abirritation of an organism
      whereas in « Chizhevsky chandelier », routinely, industrial
      modulation 50 or 100 hz is used is used, able to call exaltation

      Inventor(s): &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; POPOVICH E A<br>
      <br>
      FIELD: medical engineering. <br>
      SUBSTANCE: device has line scan unit transformer of operating
      TV-set device, voltage multiplier with radiator. The chandelier
      has the second voltage multiplier connected to kinescope. Both
      multipliers are connected to transformer unit winding of operating
      TV-set device in opposite polarity via commutator, supplying
      voltage to the multipliers. <br>
      EFFECT: low device production cost.<br>
      <br>
      [0001]<br>
      The invention relates to electrotherapy, namely to the emitters
      for air ionization.<br>
      <br>
      [0002]<br>
      Chizhevskogo known chandelier whose design is described in the
      magazine "Radio", N1, 1997, s.36-37.<br>
      Chandelier includes an emitter and a voltage converter comprising
      a transformer and a multiplier.<br>
      <br>
      [0003]<br>
      The disadvantage of this design is its relatively high cost
      because of expensive units designed only for its intended purpose
      (for chandeliers Chizhevskogo).<br>
      <br>
      [0004]<br>
      The real challenge is to create a universal device that would
      combine several functions, such as a TV or display (manitor) and
      chandelier Chizhevskogo.<br>
      <br>
      [0005]<br>
      This problem is solved by using the proposed Chizhevskogo
      chandeliers, comprising a power supply with a voltage multiplier
      aeroinov emitter where the primary power source for the
      transformer output unit of the TV horizontal active, coupled to
      said multiplier, and said high voltage for the transformer is
      provided with an additional winding formed in opposition to the
      base, and the multiplier used television, but is included in the
      reverse polarity.<br>
      When two multipliers may be administered switch.<br>
      In addition, each version can be performed with the emitter
      electrode in the form of framing the picture tube TV.<br>
      <br>
      [0006]<br>
      Such embodiments of the device, which combines the two functions
      (TV, chandelier Chizhevskogo), where the power supply is the
      transformer unit chandeliers horizontal existing TV, can
      significantly reduce the sebestoymost Chizhevskogo chandeliers and
      reduce or eliminate the harmful effects of TV, the display on
      human health<br>

      <div align="left">Brief Description of the drawing, where Figure 1
        shows a connection diagram for the transformer with the
        chandelier Chizhevskogo TV at 2 - scheme wherein the transformer
        is provided with an additional high-voltage winding 3 - scheme
        where two multipliers introduced at the switch in FIG. 4 -
        layout of the cathode as a frame of the picture tube TV.<br>
      </div>
      <br>
      [0008]<br>
      Chandelier Chizhevskogo contains the transformer high voltage
      winding 1 (1), the multiplier 2 with an output voltage (+) on the
      CRT 3 of the TV.<br>
      By the transformer 1, 2 is connected in parallel multiplier with a
      multiplier 4, the output voltage (-) on the horn 5.<br>
      <br>
      [0009]<br>
      Other versions Chizhevskogo chandeliers may be an option where the
      line transformer 1 (2) of the TV is equipped with an additional
      high-voltage winding 6 formed in opposition to the base and two
      outs 7 (+) and 8 (-) to the same multipliers 2, respectively, are
      connected, the output 7 kinescope 3, output 8 - 5 with a radiator.<br>
      <br>
      [0010]<br>
      Chizhevskogo execution chandeliers may be an option, shown in
      Figure 3 where two identical multiplier 2 connected to the line
      winding in the transformer 1 of opposite polarity through the
      switch 9 with a high switching frequency.<br>
      <br>
      [0011]<br>
      The cathode 10 Chizhevskogo chandeliers can be made in the form of
      individual emitters, such as a table lamp in the form of a frame,
      as shown in Figure 4.<br>
      <br>
      [0012]<br>
      Work chandeliers Chizhevskogo is as follows:<br>
      <br>
      [0013]<br>
      When you turn on the TV, in which the transformer to the line
      parallel multiplier 1 2 4 multiplier is connected to the output
      voltage (-), parallel to the voltage on the TV screen voltage is
      applied to the emitter 5 Chizhevskogo chandeliers.<br>
      There is a simultaneous emission of positive (negative health) and
      negative ions (positive for human) ions, which reduce harmful
      vzaimnoneytralizuya TV.<br>
      <br>
      [0014]<br>
      In the performance of execution, when a high-voltage transformers
      with high-voltage winding 1 is provided with 6, 2, which leave a
      negative half-wave voltage, and through the multiplier, like 2
      (TV), voltage is applied to the emitter 5 lamps Chizhevskogo in
      negative polarity.<br>
      <br>
      [0015]<br>
      In an embodiment where the transformer line 1 is connected to two
      multipliers 2 through the switch 9 which can, for example, to work
      with the horizontal scanning frequency by applying voltage to the
      multipliers 2 through cycle.<br>
      In this case, the output of the multiplier 2 produces a positive
      voltage is used to power the tube, and the output of the second -
      a negative that is used to power the chandeliers Chizhevskogo.<br>
