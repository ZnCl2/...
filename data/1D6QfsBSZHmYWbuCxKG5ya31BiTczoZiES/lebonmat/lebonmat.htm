      <p>This work is devoted to the study of the Evolution of Matter
        --- that is to say, of the fundamental components of things, of
        the substratum of the worlds and of the beings which exist on
        their surface. </p>
      <p>It represents the synthesis of the experimental researches
        which I have during the last 8 years published in numerous
        memoirs. In their result they have shown the insufficiency of
        certain fundamental scientific principles on which rests the
        edifice of our physical and chemical knowledge. </p>
      <p>According to a doctrine which seemed settled forever, and the
        building up of which has required a century of persistent labor,
        while all things in the universe are condemned to perish, two
        elements alone, Matter and Force, escape this fatal flaw. They
        undergo transformations without ceasing, but remain
        indestructible and consequently immortal. </p>
      <p>The facts brought to light by my researches, as well as by
        those to which they have led, show that, contrary to this
        belief, matter is not eternal, and can vanish without return.
        They likewise prove that the atom is the reservoir of a force
        hitherto unrecognized, although it exceeds by its immensity
        those forces with which we are acquainted, and that it may
        perhaps be the origin of most others, notably of electricity and
        solar heat. Lastly, they reveal that, between the world of the
        ponderable and that of the imponderable, till now considered
        widely separate, there exists an intermediate world. </p>
      <p>For several years I was alone in upholding these ideas.
        Finally, however, their validity has been admitted, after
        numbers of physicists have determined in various ways the facts
        I have pointed out, principally those which demonstrate the
        universality of the dissociation of matter. It was above all the
        discovery of radium, long after my first researches, that fixed
        attention on these questions. </p>
      <p>Let not the reader be alarmed at the boldness of some of the
        views which will be set forth herein. They are throughout
        supported by experimental facts. It is with these for guides
        that I have endeavored to penetrate unknown regions, where I had
        to find my way in thick darkness. This darkness does not clear
        away in a day, and for that reason he who tries to mark out a
        new road at the cost of strenuous efforts is rarely called to
        look at the horizon to which it may lead. </p>
      <p>It is not without prolonged labor and heavy expense that the
        facts detailed in this volume have been established (1). If I
        have not yet obtained the suffrages of all the learned, and if I
        have incensed many among them by pointing out the fragility of
        dogmas which once possessed the authority of revealed truths, at
        least I have met with some valiant champions amongst eminent
        physicists, and my researches have been the cause of many
        others. One can hardly expect more, especially when attacking
        principles some of which were considered unshakeable. The great
        Lamarck uttered no ephemeral truth when he said, “Whatever the
        difficulties in discovering new truths, there are still greater
        ones in getting them recognized”. </p>
      <p>[(1) To make this book easier to read, the experiments in
        detail have been brought together at the end of the volume, to
        which they form a second part. All the plates illustrating the
        experiments have been drawn or photographed by my devoted
        assistant, M. F. Michaux. I here express my thanks to him for
        his daily assistance at my laboratory during the many years over
        which my researched have extended. I also owe hearty thanks to
        my friend E. Senechal, and the eminent Prof. Dwelshauvers-Dery,
        Corresponding Member of the Institute, who have kindly revised
        the proofs of this volume.] </p>
      <p>3I should be armed with but scanty philosophy if I remained
        surprised at the attacks of several physicists, or at the
        exasperation of a certain number of worthy people, and
        especially at the silence of the greater number of the scholars
        who have utilized by experiments. </p>
      <p>Gods and dogmas do not perish in a day. To try to prove that
        the atoms of all bodies, which were deemed eternal, are not so,
        gave a shock to all received opinions. To endeavor to show that
        matter, hitherto considered inert, is the reservoir of a
        colossal energy, was bound to shock more ideas still.
        Demonstrations of this kind touching the very roots of our
        knowledge, and shaking scientific edifices centuries old, are
        generally received in anger or in silence till the day when,
        having been made over again in detail by the numerous seekers
        whose attention has been aroused, they become so widespread and
        commonplace that it is almost impossible to point out their
        first discoverer. </p>
      <p>It matters little, in reality, that he who has sown should not
        reap. It is enough that the harvest grows. Of all occupations
        which may take up the too brief hours of life, none perhaps is
        so worthy as the search for unknown truths, the opening out of
        new paths in that immense unknown which surrounds us. </p>

            of Matter</b></p>

      <p><b>1. The New Ideas on the Dissociation of Matter ~</b> </p>
      <p>The dogma of the indestructibility of matter is one of the very
        few which modern has received from ancient science without
        alteration. From the great Roman poet, Lucretius, who made it
        the fundamental element of his philosophical system, down to the
        immortal Lavoisier, who established it on bases considered
        eternal, this sacred dogma was never touched, and no one ever
        sought to question it. </p>
      <p>We shall see in the present work how it has been attacked. Its
        fall was prepared by a series of earlier discoveries apparently
        unconnected with it: cathode rays, x-rays, emissions from
        radioactive bodies, etc., all have furnished the weapons
        destined to shake it. It received a still graver blow as soon as
        I had proved that phenomena at first considered peculiar to
        certain exceptional substances, such as uranium, were to be
        observed in all the substances in nature. </p>
      <p>Facts proving that matter is capable of a dissociation fitted
        to lead it into forms in which it loses all its material
        qualities are now very numerous. Among the most important I must
        note the emission by all bodies of particles endowed with
        immense speed, capable of making the air a conductor of
        electricity, of passing through obstacles, and of being thrown
        out of their course by a magnetic field. None of the forces at
        present known being bale to produce such effects, particularly
        the emission of particles with a speed almost equaling that of
        light, it was evident that we here found ourselves in presence
        of&nbsp; absolutely unknown facts. Several theories were put
        forth in explanation of them. One only --- that of the
        dissociation of atoms, which I advanced at the commencement of
        these researches --- has resisted all criticism, and on this
        account is now almost universally adopted. </p>
      <p>It is several years now since I proved by experiment for the
        first time that the phenomena observed in substances termed
        radioactive --- such as uranium, the only substance of that kind
        then known --- could be observed in all substances in Nature,
        and could only be explained by the dissociation of their atoms.
      </p>
      <p>The aptitude of matter to disaggregate by emitting effluves of
        particles analogous to those of the cathode rays, having a speed
        of the same order as light, and capable of passing through
        material substances, is universal. The action of light on any
        substance, alighted lamp, chemical reactions of very different
        kings, an electric discharge, etc., cause these effluves to
        appear. Substances termed radioactive, such as uranium or
        radium, simply present in a high degree a phenomenon which all
        matter possesses to some extent. </p>
      <p>When I formulated for the first time this generalization,
        though it was supported by very precise experiments, it
        attracted hardly any attention. In the whole world one
        physicists, the learned Prof. de Heen, alone grasped its import
        and adopted it after having verified its perfect correctness.
        But the experiments being too convincing to permit of a long
        challenge, the doctrine of the universal dissociation of matter
        has at last triumphed. The atmosphere is now cleared, and few
        physicists deny that this dissociation of matter --- this
        radioactivity as it is now called --- is a universal phenomenon
        as widely spread throughout the universe as heat or light.
        Radioactivity is now discovered in nearly everything, and in a
        recent paper Prof. J.J. Thomson has demonstrated its existence
        in most substances --- water, sand, clay, brick, etc. </p>
      <p>What becomes of matter when it dissociates? Can it be supposed
        that when atoms disaggregate they only divide into smaller
        parts, and thus form a simple dust of atoms? We shall see that
        nothing of the sort takes place, and that matter which
        dissociates dematerializes itself by passing through successive
        phases which gradually deprive it of its material qualities
        until it finally returns to the imponderable ether whence it
        seems to have issued. </p>
      <p>The fact once recognized that atoms can dissociate, the
        question arose as to whence they obtained&nbsp; the immense
        quantity of energy necessary to launch into space particles with
        a speed of the same order as light. </p>
      <p>The explanation in reality was simple enough, since it is
        enough to verify, as I have endeavored to show, that, far from
        being an inert thing only capable of giving up the energy
        artificially supplied to it, matter is an enormous reservoir of
        energy --- intra-atomic energy. </p>
      <p>But such a doctrine assailed too many fundamental scientific
        principles established for centuries to be at once admitted, and
        before accepting it various hypotheses were successively
        proposed. Accustomed to regard the rigid principles established
        for centuries to be at once admitted, and before accepting it
        various hypotheses were successively proposed. Accustomed to
        regard the first principles of thermodynamics as absolute
        truths, and persuaded that an isolated material system could
        possess no other energy than that supplied from without, the
        majority of physicists long persisted, and some still persist,
        in seeking outside it the sources of the energy manifested
        during the dissociation of matter. Naturally, they failed to
        discover it, since it is within, and not without, matter itself.
      </p>
      <p>The reality of this new form of energy, of this intra-atomic
        energy of which I have unceasingly asserted the existence from
        the commencement of my researches, is in no way based on theory,
        but on experimental facts. Though hitherto unknown, it is the
        most powerful of known forces, and probably, in my opinion, the
        origin of most others. Its existence, so much contested at
        first, is more and more generally accepted at the present time.
      </p>
      <p>From the experimental researches which I have detailed in
        various memoirs and which will be summarized in this work, the
        following propositions are drawn: </p>
      <p>(1) Matter, hitherto deemed indestructible, vanishes slowly by
        the continuous dissociation of its component atoms. </p>
      <p>(2) The products of the dematerialization of matter constitute
        substances placed by their properties between ponderable bodies
        and the imponderable ether --- that is to say, between two
        worlds hitherto considered as widely separate. </p>
      <p>(3) Matter, formerly regarded as inert and only able to give
        back the energy originally supplied t it, is, on the other hand,
        a colossal reservoir of energy --- intra-atomic energy --- which
        it can expend without borrowing anything from without. </p>
      <p>(4) It is from this intra-atomic energy manifested during the
        dissociation of matter that most of the forces in the universe
        are derived, and notably electricity and solar heat. </p>
      <p>(5) Force and matter are two different forms of one and the
        same thing. Matter represents a stable form of intra-atomic
        energy; heat, light, electricity, etc., represent instable forms
        of it. </p>
      <p>(6) By the dissociation of atoms --- that is to say, by the
        dematerialization of matter, the stable forms of energy termed
        matter is simply changed into those unstable forms known by the
        names of electricity, light, heat, etc. </p>
      <p>(7) The law of evolution applicable to living beings is also
        applicable to simple bodies; chemical species are no more
        invariable than are living species. </p>
      <p>For the examination of these several propositions a large part
        of this work will be reserved. Let us in this chapter take them
        as proved and seek at once the changes they bring about in our
        general conception of the mechanism of the universe. The reader
        will thus appreciate the interest presented by the problems to
        which this volume is devoted. </p>
      <p><b>2. Matter and Force ~</b> </p>
      <p>The problem of the nature of matter and of force is one of
        those which have most exercised the sagacity of scholars and
        philosophers. Its complete solution has always escaped us
        because it really implies the knowledge, still inaccessible, of
        the First Cause of things. The researches I shall set forth
        cannot therefore allow is to completely solve this great
        question. They lead, however, to a conception of matter and
        energy far different from that in vogue at the present day. </p>
      <p>When we study the structure of the atom, we shall arrive at the
        conclusion that it is an immense reservoir of energy solely
        constituted b y a system of imponderable elements maintained in
        equilibrium by the rotations, attractions and repulsions of its
        component parts. From this equilibrium results the material
        properties of bodies such as weight, form, and apparent
        permanence. Mater also represents movement, but the movements of
        its component elements are confined within a very restricted
        space. </p>
      <p>This conception leads us to view matter as a variety of energy.
        To the known forms of energy --- heat, light, etc. --- there
        must be added another --- matter, or intra-atomic energy. It is
        characterized by its colossal greatness and its considerable
        accumulation within very feeble volume. </p>
      <p>It follows from the preceding statements that by the
        dissociation of atoms, one is simply giving to the variety of
        energy called matter a different form --- such as, for example,
        electricity or light. </p>
      <p>We will endeavor to give an account of the forms under which
        intra-atomic energy may be condensed within the atom, but the
        existence of the fact itself has a far greater importance than
        the theories it gives rise to. Without pretending to give the
        definition so vainly sought for if energy, we will content
        ourselves with stating that all phenomenality is nothing but a
        transformation of equilibrium. When the transformations of
        equilibrium are rapid, we call them electricity, heat, light,
        etc.; when the changes are slower, we give them the name of
        matter. To go beyond this we must wander into the region of
        hypothesis and admit, as do several physicists, that the
        elements of which the aggregate is represented by forces in
        equilibrium, are constituted by vortices formed in the midst of
        ether. These vortices possess an individuality, formerly
        supposed to be eternal, but which we know now to be but
        ephemeral. The individuality disappears, and the vortex
        dissolves in the ether as soon as the forces which maintain its
        existence cease to act. </p>
      <p>The equilibria of these elements of which the aggregate
        constitutes an atom, may be compared to those which keep the
        planets in their orbits. So soon as they are disturbed,
        considerable energies manifest themselves, as they would were
        the earth or any other planet stayed in this course. </p>
      <p>Such disturbances in planetary systems may be realized, either
        without apparent reason, as in very radioactive bodies when, for
        divers reasons, they have reached a certain degree of
        instability, or artificially, as in ordinary bodies when brought
        under the influence of various excitants --- heat, light, etc.
        These excitants act in such cases like the spark on a mass of
        powder --- that is to say, by freeing quantities of energy
        greatly in excess of the very slight cause which has determined
        their liberation. And as the energy condensed in the atom is
        immense in quantity, it results from this that to an extremely
        slight loss in matter there corresponds the creation of an
        enormous quantity of energy. </p>
      <p>From this standpoint we may say of the various forms of energy
        resulting from the dissociation of material elements, such as
        heat, electricity, light, etc., that they represent the last
        stages of matter before its disappearance into the ether. </p>
      <p>If, extending these ideas, we wish to apply them to the
        differences presented by the various simple bodies studied in
        chemistry, we should say that one simple body only differs from
        another by containing more or less intra-atomic energy. If we
        could deprive any element of a sufficient quantity of the energy
        it contains, we should succeed in completely transforming it. </p>
      <p>As to the necessarily hypothetical origin of the energies
        condensed within the atom, we will seek for it in a phenomenon
        analogous to that invoked by astronomers to explain the
        formation of the sun, and of the energies it stores up. To their
        minds this formation is the necessary consequence of the
        condensation of the primitive nebula. If this theory be valid
        for the solar system, an analogous explanation is equally so for
        the atom. </p>
      <p>The conceptions thus shortly summed up in no way seek to deny
        the existence of matter, as metaphysics has sometimes attempted
        to do. They simply clear away the classical duality of matter
        and energy. These are two identical things under two different
        aspects. There is no separation between matter and energy, since
        matter is simply a stable form of energy and nothing else. </p>
      <p>It would, no doubt, be possible for a higher intelligence to
        conceive energy without substance, for there is nothing to prove
        that it necessarily requires a support, but such a conception
        cannot be attained by us. We can only understand things by
        fitting them into the common frame of our thoughts. The essence
        of energy being unknown, we are compelled to materialize it in
        order to enable us to reason thereon. We thus arrive --- but
        only for the purpose of demonstration --- at the following
        definitions: --- Ether and matter represent entities of the same
        order. The various forms of energy (electricity, heat, light,
        matter, etc.) are its manifestations. They only differ in the
        nature and the stability of the equilibria formed in the bosom
        of the ether. It is by those manifestations that the universe is
        known to us. </p>
      <p>More than one physicist, the illustrious Faraday especially,
        has endeavored to clear away the duality existing between matter
        and energy. Some philosophers formerly made the same attempt, by
        pointing out that matter was only brought home to us by the
        intermediary of forces acting on our senses. But all arguments
        of this order were considered, and rightly, as having a purely
        metaphysical bearing. It was objected to them that it had never
        been possible to transform matter into energy, and that this
        latter was necessary to animate the former. Scientific
        principles, considered assured, taught that Nature was a kind of
        inert reservoir incapable of possessing any energy save that
        previously transmitted to it. It could no more create it than a
        reservoir can create the liquid it holds. Everything seemed then
        to point out that Nature and Energy were irreducible things, as
        independent of one another as weight is of color. It was
        therefore not without reason that they were taken as belonging
        to two very different worlds. </p>
      <p>There was, no doubt, some temerity in taking up anew a question
        seemingly abandoned forever. I have only done so because my
        discovery of the universal dissociation of matter taught me that
        the atoms of all substances can disappear without return by
        being transformed into energy. The transformation of matter into
        energy being thus demonstrated, it follows that the ancient
        duality of Force and Matter must disappear. </p>
      <p><b>3. Consequences of this Principle of the Vanishing of Matter
          ~</b> </p>
      <p>The facts summed up in the preceding pages show that matter is
        not equal, that it constitutes an enormous reservoir of forces,
        and that it disappears by transforming itself into other forms
        of energy before returning to what it is, nothingness. </p>
      <p>It can therefore be said that if matter cannot be created, at
        least can it be destroyed without return. For the classical
        adage, "Nothing is created, nothing is lost" (attributed to
        Lavoisier) must be substituted the following: --- Nothing is
        created, but everything is lost. The elements of a substance
        which is burned or sought to be annihilated by any other means
        are transformed, but they are not lost, for the balance affords
        proof that their weight has not varied. The elements of atoms
        which are dissociated, on the contrary, are irrevocably
        destroyed. They lose every quality of matter, including the most
        fundamental of them all --- weight. The balance no longer
        detects them. Nothing can recall them to the state of matter.
        They have vanished in the immensity of the ether which fills
        space, and they no longer form part of our universe. </p>
      <p>The theoretical importance of these principles is considerable.
        At the same time when the ideas I am upholding were not yet
        defensible, several scholars took pains to point out how far the
        time-honored doctrines of the everlasting nature of matte
        constituted a necessary foundation for science. Thus, for
        instance, Herbert Spencer in one of the chapters of <i>First
          Principles</i>, headed "Indestructibility of Matter", which he
        makes one of the pillars of his system, declares that, "Could it
        be shown, or could it with reason be supposed, that Matter,
        either in its aggregates or in its units, ever becomes
        non-existent, it would be needful either to ascertain under what
        conditions it becomes non-existent, or else to confess that true
        Science and Philosophy are impossible". This assertion certainly
        seems too far-reaching. Philosophy has never found any
        difficulty in adapting itself to new scientific discoveries. It
        follows, but does not precede them. </p>
      <p>It is not only philosophers who declare the impossibility of
        assailing the dogma of the indestructibility of matter. But a
        few years ago the learned chemist Naquet, then Professor at the
        Faculte de Medicine of Paris, wrote, "We have never seen the
        ponderable return to the imponderable. In fact, the whole
        science of chemistry is based on the law that such a change does
        not occur, for if it did so, goodbye to the equations of
        chemistry!". </p>
      <p>Evidently, if the transformation of the ponderable into the
        imponderable were rapid, not only must we give up the equations
        of chemistry, but also those of mechanics. However, from the
        practical point of view, none of these equations are yet in
        danger, for the destruction of matter takes place so slowly that
        it is not perceptible with the means of observation formerly
        employed. Losses in weight under the hundredth part of a
        milligram being imperceptible by the balance, chemists need not
        take them into account. The practical interest of the doctrine
        of the vanishing of matter, by reason of its transformation into
        energy, will only appear when means are found of accomplishing
        with ease the rapid dissociation of substances. When that
        occurs, an almost unlimited source of energy will be at man’s
        disposal gratis, and the face of the world will be changed. But
        we have not yet reached this point. </p>
      <p>At the present time, all these questions have only a purely
        scientific interest, and are for the time as much lacking
        practical application as was electricity in the time of Volta.
        But this scientific interest is considerable, for these new
        notions prove that the only elements to which science has
        conceded duration and fixity are, in reality, neither fixed nor
        durable. </p>
      <p>Everybody knows that it is easy to deprive matter of all its
        attributes, save one. Solidity, shape, color and chemical
        properties easily disappear. The very hardest body can be
        transformed into an invisible vapor. But, in spite of every one
        of these changes, the mass of the body as measured by its weight
        remains invariable, and always reappears. This invariability
        constituted the one fixed point in the mobile ocean of
        phenomena. It enabled the chemist, as well as the physicist, to
        follow matter through its perpetual transformations, and this is
        why they considered it as something mobile but eternal. </p>
      <p>It is to this fundamental property of the invariability of mass
        that we had always to comeback. Philosophers and scholars long
        ago gave up seeking an exact definition of matter. The
        invariability of the mass of a given quantity of substance ---
        that is to say, its coefficient of inertia measured by its
        weight, remained the sole irreducible characteristic of matter.
        Outside this essential notion, all we could say of matter was
        that it constituted the mysterious and ever-changing element
        whereof the worlds and the beings who inhabit them were formed.
      </p>
      <p>The permanence and, therefore, the indestructibility of mass,
        which one recognizes throughout the changes in matter, being the
        only characteristic by which this great unknown conception can
        be grasped, its importance necessarily became preponderant. On
        it the edifices of chemistry and mechanics have been laboriously
        built up. </p>
      <p>To this primary notion, however, it became necessary to add a
        second. As matter seemed incapable by itself of quitting the
        state of repose, recourse was had to various causes, of unknown
        nature, designated by the term forces, to animate it. Physics
        counted several which it formerly clearly distinguished from
        each other, but the advance in science finally welded them into
        one great entity, Energy, to which the privilege of immortality
        was likewise conceded. </p>
      <p>And it is thus that, on the ruins of former doctrines and after
        a century of persistent efforts, there sprang up two sovereign
        powers which seemed eternal --- matter as the fundamental woof
        of things, and energy to animate it. With the equations
        connecting them, modern science thought it could explain all
        phenomena. In its learned formulas all the secrets of the
        universe were enclosed. The divinities of old time were replaced
        by ingenious systems of differential equations. </p>
      <p>These fundamental dogmas, the bases of modern science, the
        researches detailed in this work tend to destroy. If the
        principle of the conservation of energy --- which, by-the-by, is
        simply a bold generalization of experiments made in very simple
        cases --- likewise succumbs to the blows which are already
        attacking it, the conclusion must be arrived at that nothing in
        the world is eternal. The great divinities of science would also
        be condemned to submit to that invariable cycle which rules all
        things --- birth, growth, decline, and death. </p>
      <p>But if the present researches shake the very foundations of our
        knowledge, and in consequence our entire conception of the
        universe, they are far from revealing to us the secrets of the
        universe. They show us that the physical world, which appeared
        to us something very simple, governed by a small number of
        elementary laws, is, on the contrary, terribly complex.
        Notwithstanding their infinite smallness, the atoms of all
        substances --- those, for example, of the paper on which these
        lines are written --- now appear as true planetary systems,
        guided in their headlong speed by formidable forces of the laws
        of which we are totally ignorant. </p>
      <p>The new routes which recent researches open out to the
        investigations of inquirers are yet hardly traced. It is already
        much to know that they exist, and that science has before it a
        marvelous world to explore. </p>

        <p><b><font size="+1">History of the Discovery of the
              Dissociation of Matter and of Intra-Atomic Energy</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>What brought into prominence the facts and principles
        summarized in the preceding chapter which will be unfolded in
        this work? This I will now proceed to show. The genesis of a
        discovery is rarely spontaneous. It only appears so because the
        difficulties and the hesitations which most often surround its
        inception are generally unnoticed. </p>
      <p>The public troubles itself very little with the way in which
        inventions are made, but psychologists will certainly be
        interested by certain sides of the following account. In fact,
        they will find therein valuable documents on the birth of
        beliefs, on the part played, even in laboratories, by
        suggestions and illusions, and finally on the preponderant
        influence of prestige considered as a principal element of
        demonstration. </p>
      <p>My researches preceded, in their beginning, all those carried
        out on the same lines. It was, in fact, in 1896 that I caused to
        be published in the Comptes Rendu de l’Academie des Science,
        solely for the purpose of establishing priority, a short notice
        summing up the researches I had been making for two years,
        whence it resulted that light falling on bodies produced
        radiations capable of passing through material substances.
        Unable to identify these radiations with anything known, I
        pointed out in the same note that they must probably constitute
        some unknown force --- an assertion to which I have often
        returned. To give it a name I called this radiation black light.
      </p>
      <p>At the commencement of my experiments I perforce confused
        dissimilar things which I had to separate one after the other.
        In the action of light falling on the surface of a body there
        can be observed, in fact, two very distinct orders of phenomena:
      </p>
      <p>(1) Radiations of the same family as the cathode rays. They are
        incapable of refraction or of polarization, and have no kinship
        with light. These are the radiations which to so-called
        radioactive substances, such as uranium, constantly emit
        abundantly and ordinary substances freely. </p>
      <p>(2) Infrared radiations of great wavelength which, contrary to
        all that has hitherto been taught, pass through black paper,
        ebonite, wood, stone, and, in fact, most non-conducting
        substances. They are naturally capable of refraction and
        polarization. </p>
      <p>It was not very easy to dissociate these various elements at a
        time when no one supposed that a large number of bodies,
        considered absolutely opaque, were, on the contrary, very
        transparent to the invisible infrared light, and when the
        announcement of the experiment of photographing a house in two
        minutes and in the dark-room through an opaque body would have
        been deemed absurd. </p>
      <p>Without losing sight of the study of metallic radiations, I
        gave up some time to the examination of the properties of the
        infrared (1). This examination led me to the discovery of
        invisible luminescence, a phenomenon which had never been
        suspected, and enabled me to photograph objects kept in darkness
        for 18 months after they had seen the light. </p>
      <p>[(1) In order not to confuse things which differ, I have
        reserved the term Black Light for these radiations. They will be
        examined in another volume devoted to the study of energy. Their
        properties differ considerably from those of ordinary light, not
        only by their invisibility, an unimportant characteristic due
        solely to the structure of the eye, but by absolutely special
        properties --- that, for instance, of passing through a great
        number of opaque bodies and of acting in an exactly contrary
        direction to other radiations of the spectrum.] </p>
      <p>These researched terminated, I was able to proceed with the
        study of metallic radiations. </p>
      <p>It was at the commencement of the year 1897 that I announced in
        a note published in the <i>Comptes Rendu A. S</i>., that all
        bodies struck by light emitted radiation capable of tendering
        air a conductor of electricity (2) </p>
      <p>[(2) This property is still the most fundamental characteristic
        of radioactive bodies. It was by working from this only that
        radium and polonium were isolated.] </p>
      <p>A few weeks later in C.R.A.S., I also gave details of
        quantitative experiments serving to confirm the above, and I
        pointed out the analogy of the radiations emitted by all bodies
        under the action of light with the radiations of the cathode ray
        family, an analogy which no one till then had suspected. </p>
      <p>It was at the same period that M. Becquerel published his first
        researches. Taking up the forgotten experiments of Niepce de
        Saint-Victor, and employing, like him, salts of uranium, he
        showed, as the latter had already done, that these salts emitted
        in darkness radiations able to act on photographic plates.
        Carrying this experiment further than his predecessor, he
        established the fact that the emission seemed to persist
        indefinitely. </p>
      <p>Of what did these radiations consist? Still under the influence
        of the ideas of N. de St.-Victor, Becquerel thought at first
        that it was a question of what Niepce termed “stored-up light”
        --- that is to say, a kind of invisible phosphorescence, and to
        prove it, he started experiments described at length in the <i>C.R.A.S.</i>,
        which induced him to think that the radiations emitted by
        uranium were refracted, reflected, and polarized. </p>
      <p>This point was fundamental. If the emissions of uranium could
        be refracted and polarized, it was evidently a question of
        radiations identical with light and simply forming a kind of
        invisible phosphorescence. If this refraction and polarization
        had no existence, it was a question of something totally
        different and quite unknown. </p>
      <p>Not being able to fit in M. Becquerel’s experiments with my
        own, I repeated them with different apparatus, and arrived at
        the conclusion that the radiations of uranium were not in any
        way polarized. It then followed that we had before us not any
        form of light, but an absolutely new thing, constituting, as I
        had asserted at the beginning of my researches, a new force:
        “The properties of uranium were therefore only a particular case
        of a very general law”. It is with this last conclusion that I
        terminated one of my notes in the <i>Comptes Rendu</i> of 1897.
      </p>
      <p>For nearly three years I was absolutely alone in maintaining
        that the radiations of uranium could not be polarized. It was
        only after the experiments of the Canadian physicist,
        Rutherford, that M.Becquerel finally recognized that he had been
        mistaken. </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="fig1-2.jpg" height="462" width="284"></p>
      </center>
      <p>It will be considered, I think, very curious and one of the
        most instructive chapters in the history of science that for
        three years not one single physicist was to be met with in the
        whole world who thought of repeating --- though they were
        extraordinarily simple --- the experiments of M. Becquerel on
        the refraction, reflection, and polarization of the uranium
        rays. On the contrary, the most eminent published ingenious
        theories to explain this very refraction, reflection, and
        polarization. </p>
      <p>It was a new version of the story of the child with the golden
        tooth on which the scholars of the day wrote important
        treatises, till one day it occurred to a skeptic to go see if
        the said child was really born with a golden tooth. It will be
        difficult, after such an example, to deny that, in scientific
        matters, prestige forms the essential element in conviction. We
        must therefore not scoff too much at those in the Middle Ages
        who knew no other sources of demonstration than the statements
        of Aristotle. </p>
      <p>Leaving to its fate the doctrine which for several years I
        alone upheld, I continued my researches, enlarged the circle of
        my investigation, and showed that similar radiations arise, not
        only under the action of light, but also under very varying
        influences, chemical reaction especially. It became therefore
        more and more evident that the radiations of uranium were only,
        as I said from the very first, a particular case of a very
        general law. </p>
      <p>This general law, which I have not ceased to study, is as
        follows: --- Under divers influences, light, chemical action,
        electric action, and often even, spontaneously, the atoms of
        simple bodies, as well as those of compound bodies, dissociate
        and emit effluves of the same family as the cathode rays. </p>
      <p>This generalization is at the present day almost universally
        admitted, but the preceding statement shows that it needed some
        courage to formulate it for the first time, Who could have
        supposed any relationship between the radiations of uranium and
        any effluves whatever, cathodic or otherwise, since nearly all
        physicists then admitted, on M. Becquerel’s authority, the
        polarization and the refraction of these rays? </p>
      <p>When the question as to polarization was definitely settled, it
        took but little time to establish the correctness of the facts
        stated by me. But it was only after the German physicists
        Giesel, Meyer, and Schweidler discovered in 1899 that the
        emissions of radioactive bodies were, like the cathode rays,
        capable of deviation by a magnet, that the idea of a probable
        analogy between these phenomena began to spread. Several
        physicists then took up this study, the importance of which has
        increased day by day. New facts arose on all sides, and the
        discovery of radium by Curie gave a great impetus to these
        researches. </p>
      <p>M. de Heen, Prof. of Physics at the University of Liege, and
        Director of the celebrated Institute of Physics in that town,
        was the first to accept in its entirety the generalization I had
        endeavored to establish. Having taken up and developed my
        experiments, he declared in one of is papers that in point of
        importance they were on a par with the discovery of x-rays. They
        were the origin of numerous researches on his part, which led to
        remarkable results. The movement once started, it had to be
        followed up. On all sides radioactivity was sought for, and it
        was discovered everywhere. The spontaneous emission is often
        very weak, but becomes considerable in substances placed under
        the influence of various excitants --- light, heat, etc. All
        physicists are now agree in classing in the same family the
        cathode rays and the emissions from uranium, radium, and bodies
        dissociated by light, heat, and the like. </p>
      <p>If, notwithstanding my assertions and my experiments, these
        analogies were not at once adopted, it is because the
        generalization of phenomena is at times much more difficult to
        discover than the facts from which this generalization flows. It
        is, however, from these generalizations that scientific progress
        is derived. "Every great advance in the sciences", said the
        philosopher Jevons, "consists of a vast generalization revealing
        deep and subtle analogies". </p>
      <p>The generality of the phenomenon of the dissociation of matter
        would have been noticed much sooner if a number of known facts
        had been closely examined, but this was not done. These facts,
        besides, were spread over very different chapters of physics.
        For example, the loss of electricity occasioned by ultraviolet
        light had long been known, but one little thought of connecting
        the fact with the cathode rays. More than 50 years ago N. de
        St.-Victor saw that, in the dark, salts of uranium caused
        photographic impression for several months; but as this
        phenomenon did not seem connected with any known fact, it was
        put on one side. For a hundred years the gases of flame had been
        observed to discharge electrified bodies without anyone
        attempting to examine the cause of this phenomenon. The loss of
        electric charges through the influence of light had been pointed
        out several years before, but it was regarded as a fact peculiar
        to a few metals, without any suspicion of how general and
        important it was. </p>
      <p>All these phenomena and many others, such as electricity and
        solar heat, are very dissimilar in appearance, but are the
        consequence of the same fact --- namely, the dissociation of
        matter. The common link which connects them appeared clearly
        directly we established that the dissociation of matter and the
        forms of electricity which result from it are to be ranked among
        the most widely spread natural phenomena. </p>
      <p>The establishment of the fact of the dissociation of matter has
        allowed us to penetrate into an unknown world ruled by new
        forces, where matter, losing its properties as matter, becomes
        imponderable in the balance of the chemists, passes without
        difficulty through obstacles, and possesses a whole series of
        unforeseen properties. </p>
      <p>I have had the satisfaction of seeing, while still alive, the
        recognition of the facts on which I based the theories which
        follow. For a long time I had given up all such hope, and more
        than once had thought of abandoning my researched. They had, in
        fact, been rather badly received in France. Several of the notes
        sent by me to the Academy of Sciences provoked absolute storms.
        The majority of the members of the Section of Physics
        energetically protested, and the scientific press joined in the
        chorus. We are so hierarchized, so hypnotized and tamed by our
        official teaching, that the expression of independent ideas
        seems intolerable. Today, when my ideas have slowly filtered
        into the minds of physicists, it would be ungracious to complain
        of their criticisms or the silence of most of them towards me.
        Sufficient for me is it that they have been able to avail
        themselves of my researches. The book of nature is a romance of
        such passionate interest that the pleasure of spelling out a few
        pages repays one for the trouble this short decipherment often
        demands. I should certainly not have devoted over 8 years to
        these very costly experiments had I not at once grasped their
        immense philosophical interest and the profound perturbation
        they would finally cause to the fundamental theories of science.
      </p>
      <p>With the discovery of the universal dissociation of matter is
        linked that of intra-atomic energy, by which I have succeed in
        explaining the radioactive phenomena. The second was the
        consequence of the first-named discovery. </p>
      <p>The discovery of intra-atomic energy cannot, however, be quite
        assimilated to that of the universality of the dissociation of
        matter. This universal dissociation is a fact, the existence of
        intra-atomic energy is only an interpretation. This
        interpretation, besides. Was necessary, for, after having tried
        several hypotheses to explain the radioactive phenomena,&nbsp;
        nearly all physicists have finally fallen in with the
        explanation I proposed when I announced that science was face to
        face with a new force hitherto entirely unknown. </p>
      <p>It may interest the reader to know how the researches which
        have thus been briefly recorded were received in various
        countries. </p>
      <p>It was especially abroad that they created a deep impression.
        In France, they met with a hostility which was not, however,
        unanimous, as will be seen by M. Dastre, Prof. at the Sorbonne
        and a member of the Institute: </p>
      <p>"In the course of 5 years a fairly long journey has been
        covered on the road towards the generalization of the fact of
        radioactivity. Starting with the idea of a property specific to
        uranium, we have reached the supposition of a well-nigh
        universal natural phenomenon. </p>
      <p>"It is right to recall that this result was predicted with
        prophetic perspicacity by Gustave Le Bon. From the outset this
        scholar endeavored to show that the action of light, certain
        chemical reactions, and lastly the action of electricity, call
        forth the manifestation of this particular mode of energy. Far
        from being rare, the production of these rays is unceasing. Not
        a sunbeam falls on a metallic surface, not an electric spark
        flashes, not a discharge takes place, not a single body becomes
        incandescent, without the appearance of a pure or transformed
        cathode ray. To Gustave LeBon must be ascribed the merit of
        having perceived from the first the great generality of this
        phenomenon. Even though he has used the erroneous term of Black
        Light, he has nonetheless grasped the universality and the
        principal features of this product. He has above all set the
        phenomenon in its proper place by transferring it from the
        closet of the physicist into the grand laboratory of nature". (<i>Revue









          des Deux Mondes</i>, 1901) </p>
      <p>In one of the annual reviews on physical studies which he
        publishes annually, Prof. Lucien Poincare has very clearly
        summarized my researched in the following lines: </p>
      <p>"M. Gustave Le Bon, to whom we owe numerous publications
        relating to the phenomena of the emission by matter of various
        radiations, and who was certainly one of the first to think that
        radioactivity is a general phenomenon of nature, supposes that
        under very different influences, light, chemical action,
        electrical action, and often even spontaneously, the atoms of
        simple bodies dissociate and emit effluves of the same family as
        cathode and x-rays; but all these manifestations would be
        particular aspects of an entirely new form of energy, quite
        distinct from electrical energy, and as widely spread throughout
        nature as heat. M. de Heen adopts similar ideas" (<i>Rev.
          Generale des Sciences</i>, January 1903). </p>
      <p>I have only one fragment of a phrase to correct in the above
        lines. The eminent scholar says that I was "one of the first" to
        show that radioactivity is a universal phenomenon. This should
        read "the first". It suffices to turn to the texts and to their
        dates of publication to be convinced of this fact. My first
        memoir on the radioactivity of all bodies under the action of
        light appeared in the <i>Revue Scientifique</i> of May 1897. </p>
      <p>It is natural enough that one should not be a prophet in one’s
        own country. It is sufficient to be a little of one elsewhere.
        The importance of the results brought to light by my researches
        was very quickly understood abroad. Out of the different studies
        they called forth, I shall confine myself to reproducing a few
        fragments. </p>
      <p>The first is a portion of the preamble to four articles devoted
        to my experiments in the <i>English Mechanic,</i> January-April
        1903): --- </p>
      <p>"During six years Gustave Le Bon has continued his researches
        on certain reactions which he at fist termed Black Light. He
        scandalized orthodox physicists by his audacious assertion that
        there existed something else which had been quite unknown.
        However, his experiments decided other searchers to verify his
        assertions, and many unforeseen facts were discovered;
        Rutherford in America, Nedon in France, de Heen in Belgium,
        Lenard in Austria, Elseter and Geitel in Switzerland have
        successfully followed in the lines of Gustave Le Bon. Summing up
        today the experiments made by him for the last six years,
        Gustave Le Bon shows that he has discovered a new force in
        nature which manifests herself in all bodies. His experiments
        cast a vivid light on such mysterious subjects as the x-rays,
        radioactivity, electrical dispersion, the action of ultraviolet
        light, etc., Classical books are silent on all these subjects,
        and the most eminent electricians know not how to explain these
        phenomena". </p>
      <p>The second of the articles to which I have above alluded is one
        in The Academy (Dec. 6, 1902, under this heading: "New Form of
        Energy": </p>
      <p>"Hardly anything is more marked than the way in which the ideas
        of men of science with regard to force and matter have
        completely changed during the last 10 years" The atomic theory
        that every scrap of matter could be divided in the last resort
        into atoms ach in itself indivisible and combining among
        themselves only in fixed proportions, was then a law of
        scientific faith, and led to pronouncements like those of a late
        President of the Chemical Society, who informed his hearers in
        his annual allocution that the age of discovery in chemistry was
        closed, and that henceforth we had better devote ourselves to a
        thorough classification of chemical phenomena. But this
        prediction was no sooner uttered than it was falsified. There
        came before us Mr. (not then Sir William) Crookes’ discovery oF
        what he called ‘radiant matter’ --- then Roentgen’s ray ---…
        until now M. Gustave LeBon… assured us that these new ideas are
        not several things but one thing, and that they all of them
        point to a form of matter spread throughout the world indeed,
        but so inconceivably minute that it becomes not matter but
        force... The consequences of the final acceptance of [M. Le
        Bon’s] theory are fairly enormous... As for chemistry, the whole
        fabric will be demolished at a blow; and we shall have a tabula
        rasa on which we may write an entirely new system wherein matter
        will pass through matter, and ‘elements’ will be shown to be
        only differing forms of the same substance. But even this will
        be nothing compared with the results which will follow the
        bridging of the space between the material and the immaterial
        which M. Le Bon anticipates as the result of his discoveries,
        and which Sir William Crookes seems to have foreshadowed in his
        address to the Royal Society upon its late reception of the
        Prince of Wales". </p>
      <p>I will add to these quotations a passage from the divers
        articles which M. de Heen, Prof. of Physics at the University of
        Liege, ha kindly devoted to my researches: --- </p>
      <p>"The resounding effect produced in the world by the discovery
        of the x-rays is well known, a discovery which was immediately
        followed by one more modest in appearance, but perhaps more
        important in reality ---, viz., that of Black Light, as the
        result of the researched of Gustave LeBon. This last scholar
        proved that bodies struck by light, especially metals, acquire
        the faculty of producing rays analogous to the x-rays, and
        discovered that this was not simply an exceptional phenomenon,
        but, on the contrary, one of an order of phenomena as common
        throughout nature as caloric, electricity, and luminous
        manifestations, a thesis which I also have constantly upheld
        from that time". </p>
      <p>But all this is already ancient history. The anger which my
        first researches provoked in France has vanished. The staffs of
        the laboratories formerly so hostile have welcomed with
        sympathetic curiosity the first editions of this work. The proof
        of this I have found in several articles, and especially in the
        review by one of the most distinguished young scholars of the
        Sorbonne, of which I give a few extracts: --- </p>
      <p>"It will be Dr Le Bon’s title to fame that he was the first to
        attack the dogma of the indestructibility of matter, and that he
        has destroyed it within the space of a few years. In 1986 he
        published a short note which will mark one of the most important
        dates in the history of science, for it has been the starting
        point of the discovery of the dissociation of matter... To the
        already known forms of energy, heat, light, etc., another must
        be added, namely matter or intra-atomic energy. The reality of
        this new form of energy, which Dr LeBon has made known to us,
        rests in no way upon theory,&nbsp; but is deduced from
        experimental fact. Although unknown till now, it is the most
        mighty of known forces, and may even be the origin of most of
        the others... The beginning of Dr Le Bon’s work produces in the
        reader a deep impression; one feels in it the breath of a
        thought of genius... Dr LeBon has been compared to Darwin. If
        one were bound to make a comparison, I would rather compare him
        to Lamarck. Lamarck was the first to have a clear idea of the
        evolution of living beings. Dr Le Bon was the first to recognize
        the possibility of the evolution of matter, and the generality
        of the radioactivity by which its disappearance is manifested"
        (Georges Bohn, <i>Revue des Idees</i>, 15 January 1906). </p>
      <p>The reader will, I hope, excuse this short pleading. The
        repeated forgetfulness of certain physicists has compelled me to
        utter it. The new phenomena I have discovered have cost me too
        much labor, too much money, and too much annoyance for me not to
        try to keep a firm hold on a prize obtained with so much
        difficulty. </p>

      </center>
      <br>
      <p><b>(1) The Existence of Intra-Atomic Energy</b> </p>
      <p>I have given the name of Intra-atomic Energy to the new force,
        differing entirely from those hitherto observed, which is
        produced by the dissociation of matter --- that is to say, by
        the whole series of radioactive phenomena. From the
        chronological point of view, I ought evidently to commence by
        describing this dissociation; but as intra-atomic energy governs
        all the phenomena examined in this work, it seems to me
        preferable to begin by its study. </p>
      <p>I shall therefore suppose an acquaintance with the facts
        concerning the dissociation of matter which I shall set forth
        later, and shall confine myself at present to recalling one of
        the most fundamental of these facts --- the emission into space,
        from bodies undergoing dissociation, of immaterial particles
        animated by a speed capable of equaling and even of eften
        exceeding a third of the speed of light. That speed is immensely
        superior to any we can produce by the aid of the known forces at
        our disposal. This is a point which must be steadily kept in
        mind from the first. A few figures will suffice to make this
        difference evident. </p>
      <p>A very simple calculation shows, in fact, that to give a small
        bullet the speed of dissociation would require a firearm capable
        of containing 1,340,000 barrels of gunpowder. As soon as the
        immense speed of the particles emitted was measured by the very
        simple methods I describe elsewhere, it became evident that an
        enormous amount of energy is liberated during the dissociation
        of atoms. Physicists then sought in vain and many are still
        seeking the external source of this energy. It was understood,
        in fact, to be a fundamental principle that matter is inert and
        can only give back, in some form or other, the energy which has
        first been supplied to it. The source of the energy manifested
        could therefore only be external. </p>
      <p>When I proved that radioactivity is a universal phenomena and
        not peculiar to a small number of exceptional bodies, the
        question became still more puzzling. But, as this radioactivity
        is above all manifested under the influence of external agents
        --- light, heat, chemical forces, etc. --- it is comprehensible
        that we should seek for the origin of this proved energy among
        these external causes, though there is no comparison between the
        magnitude of the effects produced and their supposed causes. As
        to spontaneously radioactive bodies, no explanation of the same
        order was possible, and this is why the question set forth above
        remained unanswered and seemed to constitute an inexplicable
        mystery. Yet, in reality, the solution to the problem is very
        simple. In order to discover the origin of the forces which
        produce the phenomena of radioactivity, one has only to lay
        aside certain classical dogmas. Let us first of all remark that
        it is proved by experiments that the particles emitted during
        dissociation possess identical characteristics, whatever the
        substance in question and the means used to dissociate it.
        Whether we take the spontaneous emission from radium or from a
        metal under the action of light, or again from a Crookes’ tube,
        the particles emitted are similar. The origin of the energy
        which produces the observed effects seems therefore to be always
        the same. Not being external to matter, it can only exist within
        this last. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;It is this energy which I have designated by the term
        intra-atomic energy. What are its fundamental characteristics?
        It differs from all forces known to us by its very great
        concentration, by its prodigious power, and by the stability of
        the equilibria it can form. We shall see that, if instead of
        succeeding in dissociating thousandths of a milligram of matter,
        as at present, we could dissociate a few kilograms, we should
        possess a source of energy compared with which the whole
        provision of coal contained in our mines would represent an
        insignificant total. It is by reason of the magnitude of
        intra-atomic energy tht radioactive phenomena manifest
        themselves with the intensity we observe. This is it which
        produces the emission of particles having an immense speed, the
        penetration of material bodies, the apparition of x-rays, etc.,
        phenomena which we will examine in detail in other chapters. Let
        us confine ourselves, for the moment, to remarking that effects
        such as these can be caused by none of the forces previously
        known. The universality in nature of intra-atomic energy is one
        of the characteristics most easy to define. We can recognize its
        existence everywhere, since we now discover radioactivity
        everywhere. The equilibria it forms are very stable, since
        matter dissociates so feebly that for a long time one could
        believe it to be indestructible. It is, besides, the effect
        produced on our senses by these equilibria that we call matter.
        Other forms of energy --- light, electricity, etc., are
        characterized by very unstable equilibria. </p>
      <p>The origin of intra-atomic energy is not difficult to
        elucidate, if one supposes, as do the astronomers, that the
        condensation of our nebula suffices by itself to explain the
        constitution of our solar system. It is conceivable that an
        analogous condensation of the ether may have begotten the
        energies contained in the atom. The latter may be roughly
        compared to a sphere in which a non-liquifiable gas was
        compressed to the degree of thousands of atmospheres at the
        beginning of the world. </p>
      <p>If this new force --- the most widespread and the mightiest of
        all those of nature --- has remained entirely unknown till now,
        it is because, in the first place, we lacked the reagents
        necessary for the proof of its existence, and then, because the
        atomic edifice erected at the beginning of the ages is so
        stable, so solidly united, that its dissociation --- at all
        events by our present means --- remains extremely slight. Were
        it otherwise the world would have vanished long ago. </p>
      <p>But how is it that a demonstration so simple as that of the
        existence of intra-atomic energy has not been made since the
        discovery of radioactivity, and especially since I have
        demonstrated the generality of this phenomenon? This can only be
        explained by bearing in mind that it was contrary to all known
        principles to recognize that matter could by itself produce
        energy. Now, scientific dogmas inspire the same superstitious
        fear as did the gods of old, though they have at times all their
        liability to be broken. </p>
      <p><b>(2) Estimate of the Quantity of Intra-Atomic Energy
          Contained in Matter ~</b> </p>
      <p>I have said a few words as to the magnitude of intra-atomic
        energy. Let us now try to measure it. </p>
      <p>[Page 40 missing] </p>
      <p>... millions of kilograms, figures which correspond to about
        6,800,000,000 horsepower if this gram of matter were stopped in
        a second. This amount of energy, suitably disposed, would be
        sufficient to work a goods train on a horizontal line equal in
        length to a little over four times and a quarter the
        circumference of the earth. To send this same train over this
        distance by means of coal would take 2,830,000 kilograms. </p>
      <p>What determines the greatness of the above figures and makes
        them at first sight improbable is the enormous speed of the
        masses in play, a speed which we cannot approach by any known
        mechanical means. In the factor mv<sup>2</sup>, the mass of one
        gram is certainly very small, but the speed being immense the
        effects produced become equally immense. A rifle-ball falling on
        the skin from the height of a few centimeters produces no
        appreciable effect in consequence of its slight speed. As soon
        as this speed is increased, the effects become more and more
        deadly, and with the speed of 1000 meters/second given by the
        powder now employed, the bullet will pass through very resistant
        obstacles. To reduce the mass of a projectile matters nothing if
        one arrives at a sufficient increase in speed. This is exactly
        the tendency of modern musketry, which constantly reduces the
        caliber of the bullet but endeavors to increase its speed. </p>
      <p>Now the speed which we can produce are absolutely nothing
        compared with those of the particles of dissociated matter. We
        can barely exceed a kilometer per second by the means at our
        disposal, while the speed of radioactive particles is 100,000
        times greater. Thence the magnitude of the effects produced.
        These differences become plain when one knows that a body having
        a velocity of 100,000 kilometers/second would go from the earth
        to the moon in less than four seconds, while a cannon ball would
        take about 5 days. </p>
      <p>Taking into account a part only of the energy liberated in
        radioactivity, and by a different method, figures inferior to
        those given above, but still colossal, have been arrived at. The
        measurements of Curie prove that one gram of radium emits 100
        calorie-grams/hour, which would give 876,000 calories/year. If
        the life of a gram of radium is 1000 years, as is supposed, by
        transforming these calories into kilogram-meters at the rate of
        1125 kilogram-meters per great calorie, the immensity of the
        figures obtained will readily appear. Necessarily, these
        calories, high as is their number, only represent an
        insignificant part of the intra-atomic energy, since the latter
        is expended in various radiations. </p>
      <p>The fact of the existence of a considerable condensation of
        energy within the atoms only seems to jar on us because it is
        outside the range of things formerly taught us by experience; it
        should, however, be remarked that, even leaving on one side the
        facts revealed by radioactivity, analogous concentrations are
        daily observable. Is it not strikingly evident, in fact, that
        electricity must exist at an enormous degree of accumulation in
        chemical compounds, since it is found by the electrolysis of
        water that one gram of hydrogen possesses an electric charge of
        96,000 coulombs? One gets an idea of the degree of condensation
        at which the electricity existed before its liberation, from the
        fact that the quantity above mentioned is immensely superior to
        what we are able to maintain on the largest surfaces at our
        disposal. Elementary treatises have long since pointed out that
        barely a 20th part of the above quantity would suffice to charge
        a globe the size of the earth to a potential of 6000 volts. The
        best static machines in our laboratories hardly give forth
        1/10,000 of a coulomb per second. They would have to work
        unceasingly for a little over 30 years to give the quantity of
        electricity contained within the atoms of one gram of hydrogen.
      </p>
      <p>As electricity exists in a state of considerable concentration
        in chemical compounds, it is evident that the atom might have
        been regarded long since as a veritable condenser of energy. To
        grasp thereafter the notion that the quantity of this energy. To
        grasp thereafter the notion that the quantity of this energy
        must be enormous, it was only necessary to appreciate the
        magnitude of the attractions and repulsions which are produced
        by the electric charges before us. It is curious to note that
        several physicists have touched the fringe of this question
        without perceiving its consequences. For example, Cornu pointed
        out that if it were possible to concentrate a charge of one
        coulomb on a very small sphere,, and to bring it within one
        centimeter of another sphere likewise having a charge of one
        coulomb, the force created by this repulsion would equal 9<sup>18</sup>
        dynes, or about 9 billion kilograms. </p>
      <p>Now, we have seen above that by the dissociation of water we
        can obtain from one gram of hydrogen an electric charge of
        96,000 coulombs. It would be enough --- and this is exactly the
        hypothesis lately enunciated by J.J. Thomson --- to dispose the
        electric particles at suitable distances within the atom, to
        obtain, through their attractions, repulsions, and rotations,
        extremely powerful energies in an extremely small space. The
        difficulty was not, therefore, in conceiving that a great deal
        of energy could remain within an atom. It is even surprising
        that a notion so evident was not formulated long since. </p>
      <p>Our calculation of radioactive energy has been made within
        those limits of speed at which experiments show that the inertia
        of these particles does not sensibly vary, but it is possible
        that one cannot assimilate their inertia --- though this is
        generally done --- to that of material particles, and then the
        figures might be different. But they would nonetheless be
        extremely high. Whatever the methods adopted and the elements of
        calculation employed --- velocity of the particles, calories
        emitted, electric attractions, etc. --- one arrives at figures
        differing from each other indeed, but all extraordinarily high.
        Thus, for example, Rutherford fixes the energy of the alpha
        particles of thorium at 600,000,000 times that of a rifle-ball.
        Other physicists who, since the publication of one of my papers
        have gone into the subject, have reached figures sometimes very
        much higher. Assimilating the mass of electrons to that of the
        material particles, Max Abraham arrives at this conclusion:
        "That the number of electrons sufficient to weigh one gram carry
        with them an energy of 6 x 10 13 joules". Reducing this figure
        to our ordinary unit, it will be seen to represent about 80
        million horsepower per second, about 12 times greater than the
        figures I found for the energy emitted by one gram of particles
        with a speed of 100,000 kilometers per second. </p>
      <p>J.J. Thomson also has gone into estimates of the magnitude of
        the energy contained in the atom, starting with the hypothesis
        that the material atom is solely composed of electric particles.
        His figures, though also very high, are lower than those just
        given. He finds that the energy accumulated in one gram of
        matter represents 1.02 x 10<sup>19</sup> ergs, which would be
        about 100 billion kilogram-meters. These figures only represent,
        according to him, "an exceedingly small fraction" of that
        possessed by the atoms at the beginning and gradually lost by
        radiation. </p>
      <p><b>(3) Forms Under Which Energy Can Be Condensed In Matter ~</b>
      </p>
      <p>Under what forms can intra-atomic energy exist. And how can
        such colossal forces have been concentrated in very small
        particles? The idea of such a concentration seems at first sight
        inexplicable, because our ordinary experience tells us that the
        extent of mechanical power is always associated with the
        dimensions of the apparatus concerned in its production. A 1000
        hp engine is of considerable volume. By association of ideas we
        are therefore led to believe that the extent of mechanical
        energy implies the extent of the apparatus which produces it.
        But this is a pure illusion consequent on the weakness of our
        mechanical systems, and easy to dispel by very simple
        calculations. One of the most elementary formulas of dynamics
        teaches us that the energy of a body of constant size can be
        increased at will simply by increasing its speed. It is
        therefore possible to imagine a theoretical machine composed of
        the head of a pin turning round in the bezel of a ring, which,
        notwithstanding its smallness, should possess, thanks to its
        rotative force, a mechanical power equal to that of several
        thousand locomotives. </p>
      <p>To fix our ideas, let us suppose a small bronze sphere (density
        8.842) with a radius of 3 millimeters and consequently of one
        gram in weight. Let us suppose that it rotates in space round
        one of its diameters with an equatorial speed equal to that of
        the particles of dissociated matter (100,000 kilograms/second),
        and that, by some process or other, the rigidity of the metal
        has been made sufficient to resist this rotation. Calculating
        the vis viva&nbsp; [kinetic energy] of this sphere it will be
        seen to corresponding to 203,873,000,000 kilogram-=meters. This
        is nearly the work that 1510 locomotives averaging 500 hp each
        would supply in an hour. Such is the amount of energy that could
        be contained in a v ery small sphere animated by a rotary
        movement of which the speed should be equal to that of the
        particles of dissociated matter. If the same little ball turned
        on its own center with the velocity of light (300,00
        kilograms/second) which represents about the speed of the beta
        particles of radium, its kinetic energy would be 9 times
        greater. It would exceed 1.8 billion kilogram-meters and
        represent the work of one hour by 13,590 locomotives. </p>
      <p>It is precisely these excessively rapid movements of rotation
        on their axis and round a center that the elements which
        constitute the atoms seem to possess, and it is their speed
        which is the origin of the energy they contain. We have been led
        to suppose the existence of these movements of rotation by
        various mechanical considerations much anterior to the
        discoveries of the present day. These last have simply confirmed
        former ideas and have retransferred to the elements of the atom
        the motion which was attributed to the atom itself at a time
        when it was considered indivisible. It is only, no doubt,
        because they possess such velocities of rotation that the
        elements which constitute the atoms can, when leaving their
        orbits under the influence of various causes, be launched at a
        tangent through space with the velocities observed in the
        emissions of particles of matter in the course of dissociation.
      </p>
      <p>The rotation of the elements of the atom is moreover the very
        condition of their stability, as it is for a top or a gyroscope.
        When under the influence of any cause the speed of rotation
        falls below a certain critical point, the equilibrium of the
        particles becomes unstable, their kinetic energy increases and
        they may be expelled from the system, a phenomenon which is the
        commencement of the dissociation of the atom. </p>
      <p><b>(4) The Utilization of Intra-Atomic Energy ~</b> </p>
      <p>The last objections of the doctrine of intra-atomic energy are
        daily disappearing, and it is now hardly contested that matter
        is a prodigious reservoir of energy; while the search for the
        means of easily liberating this energy will surely be one of the
        most important problems of the future. It is important to notice
        that, although the numbers above arrived at in various ways
        point out the existence in matter of immense forces --- so
        unforeseen hitherto --- they by no means imply that these forces
        already are at our disposal. In fact the substances which
        dissociate quickest, like radium, only disengage very minute
        quantities of energy. All those millions of kilogram-meters
        which a simple gram of matter contains amount in reality to very
        little if, to obtain them, we have to wait millions of years.
        Suppose a strong box containing several thousand millions of
        gold dust to be closed by a mechanism which only permits the
        daily extraction of a milligram of the precious metal. The owner
        of that strong box, notwithstanding his great wealth, would be
        in reality very poor, and would remain so, so long as his
        efforts to discover the secret of the mechanism by which he
        could open it were unsuccessful. </p>
      <p>This is our position as regards the forces enclosed in matter.
        But, to succeed in capturing them, it was first necessary to be
        acquainted with their existence, and of this one had not the
        least idea a few years ago. It was even though very certain that
        they did not exist. But shall we succeed in easily liberating
        the colossal power which the atoms conceal in their bosom? No
        one can foresee this. No more could one say in the days of
        Galvani that the electrical energy which enabled him to move
        with difficulty the legs of frogs and to attract small scraps of
        paper would one day set in motion enormous railway trains. It
        will perhaps always be beyond our power to totally dissociate
        the atom, because the difficulties must increase as dissociation
        advances, but it would suffice if we could succeed in easily
        dissociating a small part of it. Whether the gram of dissociated
        matter that we have supposed to be taken from a ton of matter or
        even more, matters nothing. The result would always be the same
        from the point of view of the energy produced. The researches
        which I have essayed on these lines, and which will be set forth
        here, show that it is possible to largely hasten the
        dissociation of various substances. </p>
      <p>The methods of dissociation are, as we shall see, numerous. The
        most simple is the action of light. It has further the advantage
        of costing nothing. In so fresh a field, with a new world
        opening out before us, none of our old theories should stop
        those who seek. "The secret of all who make discoveries", says
        Liebig, "is that they look upon nothing as impossible". The
        results that could be obtained in this order of researches are
        truly immense. The power to dissociate matter freely would place
        at our disposal an infinite source of energy, and would render
        unnecessary the extraction of that coal. The scholar who
        discovers the way to liberate economically the forces which
        matter contains will almost instantaneously change the face of
        the world. If an unlimited supply of energy were gratuitously
        placed at the disposal of man he would no longer have to procure
        it at the cost of arduous labor. The poor would then be on a
        level with the rich, and there would be an end to all social
        questions. </p>

        <p><b><font size="+1">Transformation Of Matter Into Energy</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>Modern science formerly established a complete separation
        between matter and energy. The classic ideas on this scission
        will be found very plainly stated in the following passage of a
        recent work by Prof. Janet: --- </p>
      <p>"The work we live in is, in reality, a double work; or rather,
        it is composed of two distinct worlds: one the world of matter,
        the other the world of energy. Copper, iron, and coal are forms
        of matter, mechanical labor and heat are forms of energy. These
        two worlds are each ruled by one and the same law. Matter and
        energy can assume various forms without matter ever transforming
        itself into energy or energy into matter... We can no more
        conceive energy without matte than we can conceive matter
        without energy" (Janet, <i>Lecons d’Electricite</i>). </p>
      <p>Never, n fact, as says M. Janet, has it been possible till now
        to transform matter into energy; or, to be more precise, matter
        has never appeared to manifest any energy save that which had
        first been supplied to it. Incapable of creating energy, it
        could only giv e it back. The fundamental principles of
        thermodynamics taught that a material system isolated from all
        external action cannot spontaneously generate energy. </p>
      <p>All previous scientific observations seemed to confirm this
        notion that no substance is able to produce energy without
        having first obtained it from outside. Matter may serve as a
        support to electricity, as in the case of a condenser; it may
        radiate heat as in the case of a mass of metal previously
        heated; it may manifest forces produced by simple changes of
        equilibrium as in the case of chemical transformation; but in
        all these circumstances the energy disengaged is but the
        restitution in quantity exactly equal to that first communicated
        to the portion of matter or employed in producing the
        combination. In all the cases just mentioned, as in all others
        of the same order, matter does no more than give back the energy
        which had first been given to it in some shape or other. It has
        created nothing, nothing has gone forth from itself. </p>
      <p>The impossibility of transforming matter into energy seemed
        therefore evident, and it was rightly invoked in the works which
        have become classic to establish a sharp separation between the
        world of matter and the world of energy. For this separation to
        disappear, it was necessary to succeed in transforming matter
        into energy without external addition. Now, it is exactly this
        spontaneous transformation of matter into energy which is the
        result of all the experiments on the dissociation of matter set
        forth in this work. We shall see from them that matter can
        vanish without return, leaving behind it only the energy
        produced by its dissociation. The spontaneous production so
        contrary to the scientific ideas of the present time, appeared
        at first entirely inexplicable to physicists busied in seeking
        outside matter and failing to find it, the origin of energy
        manifested. We have shown that the explanation becomes very
        simple so soon as one consents to recognize that matter contains
        a reservoir of energy which it can lose in part, either
        spontaneously or by the effect of slight influences. </p>
      <p>These slight influences act somewhat like a spark on a quantity
        of gunpowder --- that is to say, by liberating energies far
        beyond those of the spark. Strictly speaking it might be urged,
        doubtless, that in that case it is not matter which transforms
        itself into energy, but simply an intra-atomic energy which is
        expended; but as this matter cannot be generated without matte
        vanishing without return, we have a right to say that things
        happen exactly as if matter were transformed into energy. </p>
      <p>Such a transformation becomes, moreover, very comprehensible so
        soon as one is thoroughly penetrated with the idea that matter
        is simply that form of energy endowed with stability which we
        have called intra-atomic energy. It results from this that when
        we say that matter is transformed into energy, it simply
        signifies that intra-atomic energy has changed its aspect to
        assume those divers forms to which we give the names of light,
        electricity, etc. And if, as we have shown above, a very small
        quantity of matter can produce, in the course of dissociation, a
        large amount of energy, it is because one of the most
        characteristic properties of the intra-atomic forces is their
        condensation, in immense quantities, within an extremely
        circumscribed space. For an analogous reason a gas compressed to
        a very high degree in a very small reservoir can give a
        considerable volume of gas when the tap is opened which before
        prevented its escape. </p>
      <p>The preceding notions were quite new when I formulated them for
        the first time. Several physicists are now arriving at them by
        different ways, but they do not reach them without serious
        difficulties, because some of these new notions are extremely
        hard to reconcile with certain classic principles. Many scholars
        have as much trouble in admitting them as they experienced 50
        years ago in acknowledging as exact the principle of the
        conservation of energy. Nothing is more difficult than to rid
        oneself of the inherited ideas which unconsciously direct our
        thoughts. </p>
      <p>These difficulties may be appreciated by reading a recent
        communication from one of the most eminent of living physicists,
        Lord Kelvin, at a meeting of the British Association, regarding
        the heat spontaneously given out by radium during its
        dissociation. Yet this emission is no more surprising than the
        continuous emission of particles having a speed of the same
        order as that of light, which can be obtained not only from
        radium, but from any substance whatever. </p>
      <p>"It is utterly impossible", writes Lord Kelvin, "that the heat
        produced can proceed from the stored energy of radium. It
        therefore seems to me absolutely certain that if the emission of
        heat continues at the same rate, this heat must be supplied from
        outside" (Philosophical Magazine, February 1904). </p>
      <p>And Lord Kelvin falls back upon the commonplace hypothesis
        formed at the outset on the origin of the energy of radioactive
        bodies, which were attributable, as it was thought, to certain
        mysterious forces from the ambient medium. This supposition had
        no experimental support. It was simply the theoretical
        consequence of the idea that matter, being entirely unable to
        create energy, could only give back what had been supplied to
        it. The fundamental principles of thermodynamics which Lord
        Kelvin has helped so much to found, tell, in fact, that a
        material system isolated from all external action cannot
        spontaneously generate energy. But experiment has ever been
        superior to principles, and when once it has spoken, those
        scientific laws which appeared to be the most stable are
        condemned to rejoin in oblivion, the used-up, outworn dogmas and
        doctrines past service. </p>
      <p>Other and bolder physicists, like Rutherford, after having
        admitted the principles of intra-atomic energy, remain in doubt.
        This is what the latter writes in a paper later than his book on
        radioactivity: --- </p>
      <p>"It would be desirable to see appear some kind of chemical
        theory to explain the facts, and to enable us to knows whether
        the energy is borrowed from the atom itself or from external
        sources" (<i>Archives des Sciences Physiques a Genieve</i>,
        1905,p. 53). </p>
      <p>Many physicists, like Lord Kelvin, still keep to the old
        principles: that is why the phenomena of radioactivity,
        especially the spontaneous emission of particles animated with
        great speed and the rise in temperature during radioactivity,
        seem to the utterly inexplicable, and constitute a scientific
        enigma, as M. Ascart has recently said. The enigma, however, is
        very simple with the explanation I have given. </p>
      <p>One could not hope, moreover, that ideas so opposed to classic
        dogmas a s intra-atomic energy and the transforming of matter
        into energy should spread very rapidly. It is even contrary to
        the usual evolution of scientific ideas that they should be
        already widely spread, and should have produced all the
        discussion of which a summary will be found in the chapter
        devoted to the examination of objections. One can only explain
        this relative success by remembering that faith in certain
        scientific principles had already been greatly shaken by such
        unforeseen discoveries as those of the x-rays and of radium. </p>
      <p>The fact is that the scientific ideas which rule the minds of
        scholars at various epochs have all the solidarity of religious
        dogmas. Very slow to be established, they are very slow likewise
        to disappear. New scientific truths have, assuredly, experience
        and reason as a basis, but they are only propagated by prestige
        --- that is, when they are enunciated by scholars whose official
        position gives them prestige in the eyes of the scientific
        public. Now, it is this very category of scholars which not only
        does not enunciate them, but employs its authority to combat
        them. Truths of such capital importance as Ohm’s law, which
        governs the whole of electricity, and the law of the
        conservation of energy which governs all physics, were received,
        on their first appearance, with indifference or contempt, and
        remained without effect until the day when they were enunciated
        anew by scholars endowed with influence. </p>
      <p>It is only by studying the history of sciences, so little
        pursued at the present date, that one succeeds in understanding
        the genesis of beliefs and the laws governing their diffusion..
        I have alluded to two discoveries which were among the most
        important of the past century, and which are summarized in two
        laws, of which one can say that they ought to have appealed to
        all minds by their marvelous simplicity and their imposing
        grandeur. Not only did they strike no one, but the most eminent
        scholars of the epoch did not concern themselves about them
        except to try to cover them with ridicule. </p>
      <p>That the simple enunciation of such doctrines should have
        appealed to no one shows with what difficulty a new idea is
        accepted when it does not fit in with former dogmas. Prestige, I
        repeat, and to a very slight extent experience are alone the
        ordinary foundation of our convictions --- scientific and
        otherwise. Experiments --- even those most convincing in
        appearance --- have never constituted an immediately
        demonstrable foundation when they clashed with long since
        accepted ideas. Galileo learned this to his cost when, having
        brought together all the philosophers of the celebrated
        University of Pisa, he thought to prove to them by experiment
        that, contrary to the then accepted ideas, bodies of different
        weight fell with the same velocity. Galileo’s demonstration was
        assuredly very conclusive, since by letting fall at the same
        moment from the top of a tower a small leaden ball and a cannon
        shot of the same metal, he showed that both bodies reached the
        ground together. The professors contented themselves with
        appealing to the authority of Aristotle, and in nowise modified
        their opinions. </p>
      <p>Many years have passed away since that time, but the degree of
        receptivity of minds for new things has not sensibly increased.

        <p><b><font size="+1">Forces Derived From Intra-Atomic Energy
              --- Molecular Forces, Electricity, Solar Heat, Etc.</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p><b>(1) The Origin of Molecular Forces ~</b> </p>
      <p>Although matter was formerly considered inert, and only capable
        of preserving and restoring the energy which had first been
        given to it, yet it was necessarily established that there
        existed within it forces sometimes considerable, such as
        cohesion, affinity, osmotic attractions and repulsions, which
        were seemingly independent of all external agents. Other forces,
        such as radiant heat and electricity, which also issued from
        matter, might be considered simple restitutions of an energy
        borrowed from outside. </p>
      <p>But if the cohesion which makes a rigid block out of the dust
        of atoms of which bodies are formed, or if that affinity which
        draws apart or dashes certain elements one upon the other and
        creates chemical combinations, or if the osmotic attractions and
        repulsions which hold in dependency the most important phenomena
        of life, are visibly force inherent to matter itself, it was
        altogether impossible with the old ideas to determine their
        source. The origin of these forces ceases to be mysterious when
        it is known that matter is a colossal reservoir of energy.
        Observation having long ago shown that any form of energy
        whatever lends itself to a large number of transformations, we
        easily conceive how all the molecular forces may be derived from
        intra-atomic energy: cohesion, affinity, etc., hitherto so
        inexplicable. We are far from being acquainted with their
        character, but at least we see the source from which they
        spring. </p>
      <p>Outside the forces plainly inherent to matter that we have just
        enumerated, there are two, electricity and solar heat, the
        origin of which has always remained unknown, and which also, as
        we shall see, find an easy explanation by the theory of
        intra-atomic energy. </p>
      <p><b>(2) The Origin of Electricity ~</b> </p>
      <p>When we approach the detailed study of the facts on which are
        based the theories set forth in this work, we shall find that
        electricity is one of the most constant manifestations of the
        dissociation of matter. Matter being nothing else than
        intra-atomic energy itself, it may be said that to dissociate
        matter is simply to liberate a little intra-atomic energy and to
        oblige it to take another form. Electricity is precisely one of
        these forms. </p>
      <p>For a certain number of years the role of electricity has
        constantly grown in importance. It is at the base of all
        chemical reactions, which are more and more considered as
        electrical reactions. It appears now as a universal force, and
        the tendency is to connect all other forces with it. That a
        force of which the manifestations have this importance and
        universality should have been unknown for thousands of years
        constitutes one of the most striking facts in the history of
        science, and is one of those facts we must always bear in mind
        to understand how we may be surrounded with very powerful forces
        without perceiving them. </p>
      <p>For centuries all that was known about electricity could be
        reduced to this: that certain resinous substances when rubbed
        attract light bodies. But might not other bodies enjoy the same
        property? By extending the friction to larger surfaces might not
        more intense effects still be produced? This no one thought of
        inquiring. Ages succeeded each other before there arose a mind
        penetrating enough to verify by experiment whether a body with a
        large surface when rubbed would not exercise an action superior
        in energy to that produced by a small fragment of the same body.
        From this verification which now seems so simple, but which took
        so many years to accomplish, we saw emerge the frictional
        electric machine of our laboratories and the phenomena it
        produces. The most striking of these were the apparition of
        sparks and violent discharges which revealed to an astonished
        world a new force and put into the hands of man a power of which
        he thought the gods alone possessed the secret. </p>
      <p>Electricity was then only produced very laboriously and was
        considered a very exceptional phenomenon. Now we find it
        everywhere and know that the simple contact of two heterogeneous
        bodies suffices to generate it. The difficulty now is not how to
        produce electricity, but how not to give it birth during the
        production of any phenomenon whatever. The falling of a drop of
        water, the heating of a gaseous mass by the sun, the raising of
        the temperature of a twisted wire, and a reaction capable of
        modifying the nature of a body, are all sources of electricity.
      </p>
      <p>But if all chemical reactions are electrical reactions, as is
        now said to be the case, if the sun cannot change the
        temperature of a body without disengaging electricity, if a drop
        of water cannot fall without producing it, it is evident that
        its role in the life of all beings must be preponderant, This,
        in fact, is what we are beginning to admit. Not a single change
        takes place in the cells of the body, no vital reaction is
        effected in the tissues, without the interference of
        electricity. M. Berthelot has recently shown the important role
        of the electric tensions to which plants are constantly
        subjected. The variations in the electric potential of the
        atmosphere are enormous, since they may oscillate between 600
        and 800 volts in fine weather, and rise to 15,000 volts at the
        least fall of rain. This potential increases at the rate of 20
        to20 volts per meter in height in fine and from 400to 500 volts
        in rainy weather for the same elevation. "These figures", he
        says, "give an idea of the potential which exists either between
        the upper point of a rod of which the other extremity is
        earthed, or between the top of a plant of a tree, and the layer
        of air in which that point or that top is bathed". The same
        scholar has proved that the effluves generated by these
        differences of tension can provoke numerous chemical reactions:
        the fixation of nitrogen on hydrates of carbon, the dissociation
        of carbonic acid into carbonic oxide and oxygen, etc. </p>
      <p>After having established the phenomenon of the general
        dissociation of matter, I asked myself if the universal
        electricity, the origin of which remained unexplained, was not
        precisely the consequence of the universal dissociation of
        matter. My experiments fully verified this hypothesis, and they
        proved that electricity is one of the most important forms of
        intra-atomic energy liberated by the dematerialization of
        matter. I was led to this conclusion after having satisfied
        myself that the products which escape from a body electrified at
        sufficient tension are entirely identical with those given out
        by radioactive substances on the road to dissociation. The
        various methods employed to obtain electricity, notably
        friction, only hasten the dissociation of matter. I shall refer,
        for the details of this demonstration, to the chapter treating
        of the subject, confining myself at present to pointing out
        summarily the different generalizations which flow from the
        doctrine of intra-atomic energy. It is not electricity alone,
        but also solar heat, which, as we shall see, may be considered
        one of its manifestations. </p>
      <p><b>(3) Origin of Solar Heat ~</b> </p>
      <p>As we have fathomed the study of the dissociation of matter, so
        has the importance of this phenomenon proportionately increased.
        After recognizing that electricity may be considered one of the
        manifestations of matter, I asked myself whether this
        dissociation and its result, the liberation of intra-atomic
        energy, were not also the cause, till now so unknown, of the
        maintenance of solar heat. The various hypotheses hitherto
        invoked to explain the maintenance of this heat --- the supposed
        fall of meteorites on the sun, for example --- having all seemed
        extremely inadequate, it was necessary to seek others. Given the
        enormous quantity of energy accumulated within the atoms, it
        would be enough, if their dissociation were more rapid than it
        is on cooled globes, to furnish the amount of heat necessary to
        keep up the incandescence of the stars. And there would be no
        need to presume, as was done when radium was supposed to be the
        only body capable of producing heat while dissociating, the
        unlikely presence of that substance in the sun, since the atoms
        of all bodies contain an immense store of energy. </p>
      <p>To maintain that stars such as the sun can keep up their own
        temperature by the heat resulting from the dissociation of their
        component atoms, seems much like saying that a heated body is
        capable of maintaining its temperature without any contribution
        from outside. Now, it is well known that an incandescent body
        --- a heated block of metal, for instance --- when left to
        itself rapidly cools by radiation, though it be the seat of
        considerable dissociation. But it cools, in fact, simply because
        the rise in temperature produced by the dissociation of its
        atoms during incandescence is far too slight to compensate for
        its loss of heat by radiation. The substances which, like
        radium, most rapidly dissociate, can hardly maintain their
        temperature at more than 3 or 4° C.&nbsp; above that of the
        ambient medium. Suppose, however, that the dissociation of any
        substance whatever were only one thousand times more rapid than
        that of radium, then the quantity of energy emitted would more
        than suffice to keep it in a state of incandescence. </p>
      <p>The whole question therefore is whether, at the origin of
        things --- that is to say, a the epoch when atoms were formed by
        condensations of an unknown nature, they did not possess such a
        quantity of energy that they have been able ever since to
        maintain the stars in a state of incandescence, thanks to their
        slow dissociation. This supposition is supported by the various
        calculation I have given as to the immense amount of energy
        contained within the atoms. The figures given are considerable,
        and yet J.J. Thomson, who has recently taken up the question
        anew, arrives at the conclusion that the energy now concentrated
        within the atoms is but an insignificant portion of that which
        they formerly contained and lost by radiation. Independently and
        at an earlier date, Prof. Filippo Re arrived at the same
        conclusion. </p>
      <p>If, therefore, atoms formerly contained a quantity of energy
        far exceeding the still formidable amount they now possess, they
        may, by dissociation, have expended during long accumulations of
        ages a part of the gigantic reserve of forces piled up within
        them at the beginning of things. They may have been able, and
        consequently may still be able, to maintain at a very high
        temperature stars like the sun and the heavenly bodies. In the
        course of time, however, the store of intra-atomic energy within
        the atoms of certain stars has at length been reduced, and their
        dissociation has become slower and slower. Finally, they have
        acquired an increasing stability, have dissociated very slowly,
        and have become such as one observes them today in the shape of
        cooled stars like the earth and other planets. </p>
      <p>If the theories formulated in this chapter are correct, the
        intra-atomic energy manifested during the dematerialization of
        matter constitutes the fundamental element whence most other
        forces are derived. So that it is not only electricity which is
        one of its manifestation, but also solar heat, that primary
        source of life and of the majority of the forces at our
        disposal. Its study, which reveals to us matter in a totally new
        aspect, already permits us top throw unforeseen light on the
        higher mechanics of our universe. </p>

        <p><b><font size="+1">The Objections To The Doctrine Of
              Intra-Atomic Energy</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>The criticisms called forth by my researches on intra-atomic
        energy prove that they have interested many scholars. As a new
        theory can only be solidly established by discussion, I thank
        them for their objections, and shall endeavor to answer them. </p>
      <p>The most important has been raised by several members of the
        Academie des Sciences. This is what M. Poincare, one of the most
        eminent, wrote to me after the publication of my researches: ---
      </p>
      <p>“I have read your memoir with the greatest interest. It raises
        a number of disturbing questions. One point to which I should
        like to call your attention is the opposition between your
        conception of the origin of solar heat and that of Helmholtz and
        Lord Kelvin. </p>
      <p>"When the nebula condenses into a sun its original potential
        energy is transformed into heat subsequently dissipated by
        radiation. </p>
      <p>"When the sub-atoms unite to form an atom this condensation
        stores up energy in a potential form, and it is when the atom
        disaggregates that this energy reappears in the form of heat
        (disengagement of heat by radium). </p>
      <p>"Thus the reaction, ‘nebula to sun’, is exothermic. The
        reaction ‘isolated sub-atoms to atoms’ is endothermic, but I
        this ‘combination’ is endothermic how comes it to be so
        extraordinarily stable?". </p>
      <p>Another member of the Academie des Sciences, M. Paul Painleve,
        formulates the same objection, as follows:--- </p>
      <p>"Thermodynamics teaches us the modifications which must be
        introduced into the celebrated principle of maximum work; we
        know that in a chemical combination stability and exothermism
        are not strictly synonymous. None the less there remains the
        possibility that a combination at the same time extraordinarily
        stable and extraordinarily endothermic is something contrary,
        not indeed to the principle of the conservation of energy, but
        to the whole body of facts which up to recent times have been
        scientifically established" (<i>Revue Scientifique</i>, 27
        January 1906). </p>
      <p>M. Naquet, late Professor of Chemistry at the Faculte de
        Medecine of Paris, who was unacquainted with M. Poincare’s
        conclusions, expressed the same objection. </p>
      <p>"There is one point, however, which I find embarrassing,
        especially if I adopt the most seductive of all hypotheses, that
        of Gustave LeBon... If the atoms disengage heat in the process
        of self-destruction they are endothermic, and, by analogy,
        should be excessively unstable. Now, on the contrary, they are
        the most stable things in the universe. </p>
      <p>"Here is a troublesome contradiction. We should not, however,
        attach to this difficulty more importance than it possesses.
        Every time great systems have arisen difficulties of this kind
        have occurred. The authors of such systems have paid no
        attention to them. If Newton and his successors had allowed the
        perturbations they observed to stop them, the law of universal
        gravitation would never have been formulated" (<i>Revue d’Italie</i>,
        March-April 1904). </p>
      <p>The objection of M.M. Poincare, Painlee, and Naquet is
        evidently sound. It would be irrefutable were it applied to
        ordinary chemical compounds, but the laws applicable to the
        chemical equilibria do not appear to apply at all to
        intra-atomic equilibria. The atom alone possesses these two
        contradictory properties, of being at once very stable and very
        instable. It is very stable, since chemical reactions leave it
        sufficiently untouched for our balances to find it always the
        same weight. It is very instable, since such slight causes as a
        ray of the sun, or the smallest rise in temperature suffice to
        begin its dissociation. This dissociation is, no doubt, slight
        --- in relation to the enormous quantity of energy accumulated
        within the atom, and it no more changes its mass than a
        shovelful of earth withdrawn from a mountain appreciably changes
        the weight of the latter, We, therefore, have to do with special
        phenomena to which none of the customary laws of ordinary
        chemistry seem to apply. To put in evidence the special laws
        which regulate these new facts cannot be the work of a day. To
        interpret a fact is sometimes more difficult than to discover
        it. </p>
      <p>M. Armand Gauthier, Member of the Institut and Professor of
        Chemistry at the Faculte de Medecine pf Paris, has also taken up
        the question of intra-atomic energy I an article published by
        him on the subject of my researches. He recognizes that it is in
        the form of gyratory movements that intra-atomic energy may
        exist. I have not wished to enter into too many details on this
        point here, because it is evidently only hypothetical, and have
        confined myself to comparing the atom to a solar system, a
        comparison at which several physicists have arrived by different
        roads. Without such movements of gyration it would be impossible
        to conceive a condensation of energy within the atom. With these
        movements it becomes easy to explain. Find the means, as I have
        pointed out above, to give a body of any size whatever, were it
        even less than that of a pin’s head, a sufficient speed of
        rotation, and you will communicate to it as considerable a
        provision of energy as you can desire. This is the precise
        condition which is realized by particles of atoms during their
        dissociation. </p>
      <p>M. Despaux, an engineer, on the contrary, entirely rejects the
        existence of intra-atomic energy. Here are his reasons: </p>
      <p>"It is the dissociation of matter which, according to Gustave
        LeBon, is the cause of the enormous energy manifested in
        radioactivity. </p>
      <p>"This view is quite a new one, and revolutionary in the highest
        degree. Science admits the indestructibility of matter, and it
        is the fundamental dogma of chemistry; it admits the
        conservation of energy, and has made it the basis of mechanics.
        Here are two conquests one must then abandon. Matter transforms
        itself into energy and conversely. </p>
      <p>"This conception is assuredly seductive and in the highest
        degree philosophical. But this transformation, it if takes
        place, only does so by a slow process of evolution. During any
        given epoch, all the phenomena studied by science lead to the
        belief that the quantity of matter and the quantity of energy
        are invariable. </p>
      <p>"Another objection arises, and a formidable one: Is it possible
        that so trifling an amount of matter carries in its loins so
        considerable a quantity of energy? Our reason refuses to believe
        it” (<i>Revue Scientifique</i>, 1 January 1904). </p>
      <p>Let us leave on one side the principle of the conservation of
        energy, which cannot evidently be discussed in a few lines, and
        remains, moreover, partly intact if it be recognized that the
        atom, by dissociation, simply gives back the energy it has
        stored up, at the beginning of the ages, during its
        transformation. The objections of M. Despaux reduce themselves,
        then, to this: reason refuses to admit that matter can conceal
        so considerable a quantity of energy. I simply reply that it is
        a question of an experimental fact, amply proved by the emission
        of particles endowed with a speed of the order of that of light,
        and by the large quantity of calories given forth by radium. The
        number of things that reason at first refused to recognize and
        yet had in the end to admit is considerable. </p>
      <p>However, I am willing to acknowledge that this conception of
        the atom as an enormous source of energy, and of such energy
        that one gram of any substance whatever contains the equivalent
        of several thousand million kilogram-meters, is too much opposed
        to received ideas to penetrate rapidly into men’s minds. But
        this is solely due to the fact that the intellectual moulds
        fashioned by education do not change easily. M. Duchaud has put
        this excellently in an article on the same subject (Revue
        Scientifique, 2 April 1904), of which this is an extract: --- </p>
      <p>"The consequences of the experiments of Gustave LeBon, which
        appear to rebel against the scientific dogmas of the
        conservation of energy and of the indestructibility of matter,
        have excited numerous objections. It follows that men’s minds
        hardly lend themselves to the admission that matter can emit
        spontaneously (that is, by itself and without any external aid)
        more or less considerable quantities of energy. This arises from
        that very old conception of the ‘duality of force and matter’
        which, by bringing us to consider them two distinct terms,
        compels us to regard matter as by itself inert... One can regard
        matter as non-inert, as being ‘a colossal reservoir of forces
        that it is able to expend without borrowing anything from
        outside, without on that account attacking the principle of the
        conservation of energy. </p>
      <p>"But the attack which aims at the indestructibility of matter
        seems more serious. Still, after due reflection, I think we
        should only see in this a question of words. </p>
      <p>"As a matter of fact, Gustave LeBon presents to us four
        successive stages of matter... while showing that everything
        returns to ether, he allows also that everything proceeds from
        it. ‘Worlds are born therein, and go there to die’, he tells us.
      </p>
      <p>"The ponderable issues from the ether, and returns to it under
        manifold influences. That is to say, the ether is a reservoir,
        at once the receptacle and the pourer-forth of matter. Now,
        unless we admit that there is a loss on the part of the ether, a
        leakage from the reservoir in the course of this perpetual
        exchange between the ponderable and the imponderable, it is
        impossible to conclude that there is a disappearance of any
        quantity of matter. And the idea of a loss on the part of the
        ether is inadmissible, for it leads to the absurd conclusion
        that that which is lost must diffuse itself outside space,
        since, by the hypothesis, the ether fills all space". </p>
      <p>M. Laisant, examiner at the Ecole Polytechnique, expresses
        similar views in a paper on these researches: --- </p>
      <p>"A small quantity of matter, for instance, a gram, contains,
        according to Gustave LeBon’s theory, an amount of energy which,
        if it were liberated, would represent thousands of millions of
        kilogram-meters. What becomes, on this conception, of the
        immaterial ether in which matter is about to lose itself? It is
        a sort of final nirvana, in the words of the author, an infinite
        and motionless nothingness, receiving everything and giving back
        nothing. In the stead of this eternal cemetery of the atoms, I
        strive to see in the ether rather the perpetual laboratory of
        nature. I would even do so far as to say that it is to the atom
        what, in biology, protoplasm is to the cell. Everything goes to
        and comes forth from it. It is a form of matter, at once its
        original and the final form" ("L’Enseignement Mathematique", 15
        January 1906). </p>
      <p>I have no reason to contradict the two authors last quoted on
        the fate of matter when it has disappeared. All I wanted to
        establish, in fact, was that ponderable mater vanishes without
        return by liberating the enormous forces it contains. Once
        returned to the ether, matter has irrevocably ceased to exist,
        so far as we are concerned. It has become something
        unrecognizable and eliminated from the sphere of the world
        accessible to our senses. There is assuredly a much greater
        distance between matter and ether than there is between carbon
        or nitrogen and the living beings formed from their
        combinations. Carbon and nitrogen can, in fact, indefinitely
        recommence their cycle by falling again under the laws of life;
        while matter returned to the ether can no more become matter
        again --- or at least can only do so by colossal accumulations
        of energy which demand long successions of ages for their
        formation, and which we could not produce without the power
        attributed in the Book of Genesis to the Creator. </p>
      <p>It is, generally, mathematicians and engineer who receive my
        ideas with most favor. But in his inaugural discourse as
        President of L’Association Francaise pour l’Avancement des
        Sciences, M. Laisant, quoted above, produced one of my most
        important conclusions, and showed all the bearing it may have in
        the future. It is especially abroad, however, that these ideas
        have found most echo. Prof. Filippo Re detailed the matter
        length in the <i>Rivista di Fisica</i>, and in a technical
        review exclusively designed for engineers (<i>Bull. De l’Assoc.
          des Ing. Ecole Polytech. De Bruxelles</i>, December 1903) </p>
      <p>Prof. Somerhausen has devoted to them a memoir from which I
        will give a few extracts because they show that in many thinking
        minds the fundamental principles of modern science have not
        inspired very unshakeable convictions. </p>
      <p>...A Revolution in Science ~ This title is apt, for the facts
        and hypotheses of which we are about to treat tend to do nothing
        less than sap two principles we have admitted as the most
        unshakeable foundations of the scientific edifice... If one
        frees oneself from the tendency to arrange new facts in already
        known categories, one will have to admit that the remarkable
        facts we have examined cannot be explained by the known modes of
        energy, and they must necessarily be interpreted, with Gustave
        LeBon, as the manifestation of an energy hitherto unsuspected. </p>
      <p>"We have established, on the one hand, the new phenomenon of
        atomic dissociation, and, on the other, the production of
        considerable energy without any possible explanation by known
        means. It is evidently logical to connect the two facts, and
        attribute to the destruction of the atom the freeing of the new
        energy --- of intra-atomic energy. </p>
      <p>"Gustave LeBon supposes that the dissociated atom has acquired
        properties intermediate between matter and ether, and between
        the ponderable and the imponderable. But from the point of view
        of the effects, clearly everything takes place as if by a direct
        transformation from mater into energy... We therefore see matter
        here appearing as a direct source of energy. Which vitiates all
        the applications of the principle of the conservation of energy.
        And as we have had to admit the possibility of the destruction
        of matter, we have to admit the possibility of the creation of
        energy. We now begin to discern the possibility, by combining
        the terms matter and energy, of arriving at a definitive
        equation which may be looked upon as the highest symbol of the
        phenomena of the universe. </p>
      <p>"It will certainly be one of the grandest conquests of science
        if we succeed, after having passed the stage of the unity of
        matter, in joining the domain of matter with that of energy, and
        thus clear away the last discontinuity in the structure of the
        world." </p>
      <p>Among the objections which I ought to mention there is one
        which must certainly have occurred to the minds of many. It was
        formulated by Prof. Pio, on one of the four articles he
        published under the title "Intra-Atomic Energy" in an English
        scientific review (<i>English Mechanic</i>, 21 January, 4 March,
        15 April, 12 May 1904). I will discuss it after reproducing a
        few passages from these articles. </p>
      <p>"All the new phenomena --- cathode rays, emanations from
        radium, etc., have been explained by the doctrine of the
        dissociation of matter by Gustave LeBon" The phenomenon of the
        dissociation of matter discovered by the latter is a\s marvelous
        as it is astounding. It has not, however, excited the same
        attention as the discovery of radium, because the close link
        which connects these two discoveries has not been perceived...
        These experiments open a perspective to inventors which
        surpasses all dreams. There is in Nature an immense source of
        force which we do not know,,, Matter s no longer inert, but a
        prodigious storehouse of energy... The theory of intra-atomic
        energy leads to an entirely new conception of natural forces...
        Till no we have only known of forces acting on atoms from
        without: gravitation, heat, light, affinity, etc. now the atom
        appears as a generator of energy independent of all external
        force. All these phenomena will serve as a foundation for a new
        theory of energy". </p>
      <p>The objection of the author to which I have alluded is this: </p>
      <p>"How is it", he asks, "that particles emitted under the
        influence of intra-atomic energy with an enormous speed do not
        render incandescent by the shock the bodies they strike, and
        where does the energy expended go to?". The answer is: if the
        particles are emitted in sufficient numbers, they may in fact
        render metals incandescent by the shock, as is observed on the
        anti-cathode of Crookes’ tube. With radium, and still more with
        ordinary substances infinitely less active, the energy is
        produced too slowly to generate such important effects. At the
        most, as is the case with radium, it may raise the temperature
        of the mass of the body by two or three degrees. Radium
        releases, according to the measurements of Curie, 100
        calorie-grams per hour, and this quantity could only raise the
        temperature of 100 grams of water by one degree in an hour. It
        is evidently too slight to raise in any appreciable way the
        temperature of a metal, especially if one considers that this
        would cool by radiation nearly as fast as it was heated. </p>
      <p>Certainly it would be quite different if radium or any other
        substance were dissociate rapidly instead of requiring centuries
        for the purpose. The scholar who discovers the way to dissociate
        instantaneously one gram of any metal --- radium, lead, or
        silver --- will not witness the results of his experiment. The
        explosion produced would be so formidable that his laboratory
        and all the neighboring houses would be instantly pulverized. So
        complete a dissociation will probably never be attained, though
        M. de Heen attributes to explosions of this kind the sudden
        disappearance of certain stars. Yet there is hope that the
        partial dissociation of atoms may be rendered less slow. I
        assert this, not as the result of theory, but as of experiment,
        by the means set forth in the sequel, I have been able to render
        metals almost deprived of radioactivity, like tin, 40 times more
        radioactive than an equal surface of uranium. </p>
      <p>The preceding discussion show that the doctrine of intra-atomic
        energy has attracted much more notice than that of the
        universality of the dissociation of matter. Yet the first-named
        was only the consequence of the second, and it was necessary to
        establish the facts before looking for the consequences. </p>
      <p>It is especially these consequences which have made an
        impression. One of our most important publication, the Annee
        Scientifique, has remarked this very clearly in a summary of
        which I give some extracts: --- </p>
      <p>"M. Gustave LeBon was the first, as we should not forget, to
        throw some light into this dark chaos, by sowing that
        radioactivity is not peculiar to a few rare substances, such as
        uranium, etc., but is a general property of matter, possessed in
        varying degrees by all bodies... </p>
      <p>"Such is, briefly and in its larger outlines, Gustave LeBon’s
        doctrine, which upsets all our traditional acquirements as to
        the conservation of energy and the indestructibility of matter.
        Radioactivity, a general and essential property of matter,
        should be the manifestation of a new mode of energy and of a
        force --- the intra-atomic energy --- hitherto unknown. </p>
      <p>"We do not yet know how to liberate and master this
        incalculable reserve of force, of which yesterday we did not
        even suspect the existence. But it is evident that when man
        shall have found the means to make himself its master, it will
        be the greatest revolution ever recorded in the annals of the
        genius of science, a revolution of which our puny brains can
        hardly grasp all the consequences and the extent". </p>
      <p>The philosophic consequences of these researches have not
        escaped several scholars. In an analysis of the first edition of
        this work published in the <i>Revue Philosophique</i> for
        November 1905, M. Sagaret, an engineer, has fully shown these
        consequences. Here are some extracts from his article: </p>
      <p>"No scientific theory has responded nor can better respond to
        our yearning for unity than that of Gustave LeBon. It sets up a
        unity than which it would be impossible to imagine anything more
        complete, and it focuses our knowledge on the following
        principle: one substance alone exists which moves and produces
        all things by its movements. This is not a new conception, it is
        true, for the philosopher, but it has remained hitherto a purely
        metaphysical speculation. Today, thanks to Dr Gustave LeBon, it
        finds a starting point in experiment. </p>
      <p>"The scholar has till now stopped at the atom without
        perceiving any link between it and the ether. The duality of the
        ponderable and the imponderable seemed irreducible. Now the
        theory of the dematerialization of matter comes to establish a
        link between them. </p>
      <p>"But it realizes scientific unity in yet another way by making
        general the law of evolution. This law, hitherto confined to the
        organic world, now extends to the whole universe. The atom, like
        the living being, develops and dies, and Dr Gustave LeBon shows
        us that the chemical species evolves like the organic species".

      </center>
      <p>Science formerly divided the various phenomena of nature into
        two sharply separated classes, with on apparent break between
        them. These distinctions have existed throughout all branches of
        knowledge, and in physics as well as in biology. </p>
      <p>The discovery of the laws of evolution has caused the
        disappearance from the natural sciences of divisions which
        formerly seemed impassable gulfs, and, from the protoplasm of
        primitive beings up to man the chain is now almost
        uninterrupted. The missing links are every day reforged and we
        get glimpses of how the change from the simplest to the most
        complicated beings has operated step by step throughout time. </p>
      <p>Physics has followed an analogous route, but has not yet
        arrived at unity. It has, however, rid itself of the fluids
        which formerly encumbered it; it has discovered the relations
        which exist between the different forces, and has recognized
        that they are but varied manifestations of one thing supposed to
        be indestructible: to wit, energy. It has also established
        permanence throughout the series of phenomena, and has shown the
        existence of the continuous where there formerly appeared only
        the discontinuous. The law of the conservation of energy is in
        reality only the simple verification of this continuity. </p>
      <p>There remain, however, in physics two deep gaps to be filled
        before this continuity can be established everywhere. Physics,
        in fact, still maintains that a wide separation exists between
        matter and energy, and another, not less considerable, between
        the world of the ponderable and that of the imponderable ---
        that is to say, between matter and the ether. Matter is that
        which is weighed. Light, heat, electricity and all the phenomena
        produced in the bosom of the imponderable ether, as they add
        nothing to the weight of bodies, are regarded as belonging to a
        very different world from that of matter. </p>
      <p>The scission of these two worlds seemed finally established.
        The most illustrious scholar of our times had even come to
        consider the demonstration of this separation as one of the
        greatest discoveries of all ages. This is how M. Berthelot
        expressed himself on the subject at the recent inauguration of
        the monument to Lavoisier: --- </p>
      <p>"Lavoisier established, by most exact experiments, a capital
        and, until his time, unrecognized distinction between the
        ponderable substances and the imponderable agencies, heat,
        light, and electricity. This fundamental distinction between
        ponderable matter and imponderable agencies is one of the
        greatest discoveries ever made; it is one of the bases of the
        present physical, chemical, and mechanical sciences". </p>
      <p>A fundamental base, in fact, and one which till now has
        appeared unshakeable. The phenomena due to the transformations
        of the imponderable ether, such as light, for instance, present
        no appreciable analogy with those of which matter is the seat.
        Matter may change its form, but, in all these changes, it
        preserves an invariable weight. Whatever be the modifications to
        which the imponderable agencies submit it, they do not add to it
        and never cause any variation in its weight. </p>
      <p>To thoroughly grasp modern scientific thought on this point,
        the above quotation must be considered in connection with that
        relating to the separation of matter and energy, reproduced in a
        previous chapter (cf. Janet, and Book II, chap. II). They show
        that the science of the day is confronted not with one only, but
        with several very distinct dualities. They may be formulated in
        the following propositions: (1) Matter is entirely distinct from
        energy and cannot of itself create energy; (2) The imponderable
        ether is entirely distinct from ponderable matter and has no
        kinship with it. The solidity of these two principles has
        hitherto seemed to defy the ages. We shall endeavor to show, on
        the contrary, that the new facts tend to utterly upset them. </p>
      <p>So far as regards the non-existence of the classic separation
        between matter and energy, we need not recur to it, since we
        have devoted a chapter to demonstrating that matter can be
        transformed into energy. It therefore only remains for us to
        inquire whether the distinction between matter and ether can
        equally disappear. A few scholars here and there had already
        remarked the jarring character of this last duality and how it
        rendered impossible the explanation of certain phenomena. Larmor
        has recently employed the manifold resources of mathematical
        analysis in the attempt to do away with what he calls "the
        irreconcilable duality of matter and ether". But if this duality
        is destined to vanish, experience alone can show that it ought
        to disappear. Now, the facts recently discovered, notably those
        relating to the universal dissociation of matter, are
        sufficiently numerous to allow of an attempt to connect the two
        worlds till now so widely separated. </p>
      <p>At first sight, the task seems a heavy one. It is not easy, in
        fact, to see how a material substance, having weight, with
        well-defined outlines, such as a stone or a piece of lead, can
        be akin to things so mobile and so subtle as a sunbeam or an
        electric spark. But we know from all the observations of modern
        science that it is not by bringing together the extremities of a
        series that the intermediate forms can be reconstructed and the
        analogies hidden under their dissimilarities discovered. It is
        not by comparing the beings who were born at the dawn of life
        with the higher order of animals with which our globe was
        afterwards peopled that the links uniting them were discovered.
        By proceeding in physics as we have done in biology, we shall
        see, on the contrary, that it is possible to bring nearer
        together things apparently so dissimilar as matter, electricity,
        and light. </p>
      <p>The facts which enable us to prove the existence of an
        intermediate world between matter and ether are in reality
        becoming more numerous every day. They have only needed
        synthesizing and interpreting. To say with reason that a certain
        substance can be considered as intermediate between matter and
        ether, it must possess characteristics allowing it to be at once
        compared to and differentiated from both these elements. It is
        because characteristics of this kind have been verified among
        the anthropoid apes that naturalists now consider them as
        forming a link between the inferior animals and man. The method
        which we shall apply will be that of the naturalists. We shall
        seek out the intermediate characteristics which allow us to say
        that a substance, while somewhat resembling matter, is yet not
        matter, and while near to the ether, is yet not the ether. </p>
      <p>Several chapters of this work will be devoted to this
        demonstration, of which we can only at present indicate the
        results. We shall endeavor to show, while throughout taking
        experiment for our guide, that the products of the
        dematerialization of matter --- that is to say, the emissions
        produced during its dissociation --- are formed from substances
        of which the characteristics are intermediate between those of
        ether and those of matter. </p>
      <p>Of what do these substances consists? Wherein have they lost
        the properties of material bodies? For a number of years
        physicists have persisted in seeing in the emissions of
        radioactive bodies only fragments of matter more or less
        tenuous. Unable to rid themselves of the concept of material
        support, they have supposed that the particles emitted were
        merely atoms --- charged with electricity, no doubt, but still,
        however, formed of matter. This opinion seemed confirmed by the
        fact that the radioactive emissions were most often accompanied
        by the projection of material particles. In Crookes’ tube the
        emission of solid particles thrown off by the cathode is so
        considerable that it has been possible to cover with metal
        bodies exposed to their bombardment. </p>
      <p>This transport (entrainment) of matter is, however, observed in
        most electrical phenomena, notably when electricity of a
        sufficiently high potential passes between two electrodes. The
        spectroscope, in fact, always reveals, I the light of the
        sparks, the characteristic lines of the metals of which these
        electrodes are composed. Yet another reason seemed to prove the
        material nature of these emissions. They could be deviated by a
        magnetic field, and were therefore charged with electricity.
        Now, as no one had yet seen the transport of electricity without
        material support, the existence of such a support was considered
        evident. </p>
      <p>The sort of material dust which was supposed to constitute the
        emissions of the cathode and those from radioactive bodies
        presented singular characteristics for a material substance. Not
        only does it present the same properties whatever the body
        dissociated, but it has also lost all the characteristics of the
        matter which gives it birth. Lenard showed this clearly when he
        sought to verify one of his old hypotheses, according to which
        the effluves generated by ultraviolet light striking the surface
        of metals are composed of the dust torn from those metals.
        Taking sodium, a body very easily dissociated by light and the
        smallest traces of which in the air can be recognized by the
        spectroscope, he found that the effluves thus emitted contained
        no trace of sodium. If, then, the emissions of dissociated
        substances are matter, it is matter which has none of the
        properties of the substances whence it comes. </p>
      <p>Facts of this nature have multiplied sufficiently to prove that
        in the cathode radiation, as well as in radioactivity, matter
        transforms itself into something which can no longer be ordinary
        matter since none of its properties are preserved. It is this
        thing of which we are about to study the characteristics and
        which we shall show belongs to the intermediate world between
        matter and the ether. </p>
      <p>So long as the existence of this intermediate work was ignored,
        science found itself confronted with facts that it could not
        classify. Thus it was, for example, that physicists were puzzled
        where to place the cathode rays which really form part of the
        intermediate substances between matte and the ether. This is why
        they placed them first in the world of matter and then in that
        of ether, notwithstanding that the two worlds were considered so
        different. Not could they naturally class them otherwise. Since
        physics supposes that phenomena can only belong tone of these
        two worlds, what does not belong to the one necessarily belongs
        to the other. In reality, they belong to neither the one nor the
        other, but to that intermediate world between the ether and
        matter that we shall study in this work. It is peopled with a
        crown of things entirely new, the acquaintance of which we are
        hardly beginning to make. </p>

              Ether</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>The greater part of physical phenomena --- light, heat, radiant
        electricity, etc., re considered to have their seat in the
        ether. Gravitation, whence are derived the mechanics of the
        world and the march of the stars, seems also to be one of its
        manifestations. All the theoretical researches formulated on the
        constitution of atoms lead to the supposition that it forms the
        material from which they are made. Although the inmost nature of
        the ether is hardly suspected, its existence has forced itself
        upon us long since, and appears to many to be more assured than
        that of matter itself. Belief in its existence became necessary
        when the propagation of forces at a distance had to be
        explained. It appeared to be experimentally demonstrated when
        Fresnel proved that light is spread by undulations analogous to
        those produced by the falling of a stone into water. By the
        interference of luminous rays he obtained darkness by the
        superposition of the prominent parts of one luminous wave upon
        the hollow parts of another. As the propagation of light is
        effected by means of undulations, these undulations are
        necessarily produced in something. This something is what is
        called the ether. <br>
        Its role has become of capital importance, and has not ceased to
        increase with the progress of physics. The majority of phenomena
        would be inexplicable without it. Without the ether there could
        be neither gravity, nor light, nor electricity, nor heat, nor
        anything, in a word, of which we have knowledge. The universe
        would be silent and dead, or would reveal itself in a form which
        cannot even foresee. If one could construct a glass chamber from
        which the ether were to be entirely eliminated, heat and light
        could not pass through it. It would be absolutely dark, and
        probably gravitation would no longer act on the bodies within
        it. They would then have lost their weight. </p>
      <p>But so soon as one seeks to define the properties of the ether,
        enormous difficulties appear. No doubt they are due to the fact
        that as this immaterial element cannot be connected with any
        known thing, terms of comparison are entirely wanting for its
        definition. Before phenomena without analogy to those habitually
        observed, we are like a person born deaf with regard to music,
        or a blind man with regard to colors. No image can make them
        understand what is a sound or a color. </p>
      <p>When books on physics state in a few lines that the ether is an
        imponderable medium filling the universe, the first idea coming
        into the mind is to represent it as a sort of gas so rarified as
        to be imponderable by the means at our disposal. There is no
        difficulty in imagining such a gas. M. Muller has calculated
        that if the matter of the sun and its surrounding planets were
        diffused through a space equal to that which divides the stars
        closest together, a cubic myriameter of this matter, in a
        gaseous state, would hardly weigh the thousandth part of a
        milligram, and consequently could not be weighted in our
        balances. This finely-divided fluid, which perhaps represents
        the primitive condition of our nebula, would be a quadrillion
        times less dense than the vacuum of the thousandth part of an
        atmosphere in a Crookes’ tube (1). </p>
      <p>[(1) Prof. Mendeleef in his <i>Principles of Chemistry</i>
        gives his reasons for thinking that the ether is a gas of the
        argon group, incapable of combination, with an atomic weight
        one-millionth of that of hydrogen and a velocity of 2,250
        km/sec.] </p>
      <p>Unfortunately the properties of the ether do not permit it to
        be in any way likened to a gas. Gases are very compressible and
        the ether cannot be so. If it were, I fact, it could not
        transmit, almost instantaneously, the vibrations of light. It is
        only in theoretically perfect fluids, or better still, in
        solids, that distant analogies with the ether can be discovered,
        but then a substance with very singular qualities has to be
        imagined. It must possess a rigidity exceeding that of steel, or
        it could not transmit luminous vibrations at a velocity of
        300,000 km/sec.. One of the most eminent of living physicists,
        Lord Kelvin, considers the ether to be "an elastic solid filling
        all space". But the elastic solid forming the ether must have
        very strange properties for a solid, which we never meet with in
        any other. Its extreme rigidity must be accompanied by an
        extraordinarily low density --- that is to say, one small enough
        to prevent its retarding by its friction the movement of the
        stars through space. Hirn has shown that if the density of ether
        were but a million times less than that of the air, rarified as
        it is, contained in a Crookes’ tube, it would cause an
        alteration of half a second every hundred years in the mean
        motion of the moon. Such a medium, notwithstanding its reduced
        density, would, however, very quickly expel the atmosphere from
        the earth. It has been calculated also that, had it the
        properties we attribute to gases, it would acquire, by its
        impact with the surface of stars deprived, like the moon, of
        their atmosphere, a temperature of 38,000° C. Finally, one is
        thrown back on the idea that the ether is a solid without
        density or weight, however unintelligible this may seem. </p>
      <p>Other physicists have recently maintained that the density of
        the ether must, on the contrary, be very great. They found their
        notion on the electromagnetic theory of matter which attributes
        the inertia of all matter to the ether. According to this
        theory, the mass of a body is nothing else than the mass of the
        surrounding ether, held and dragged along by the lines of force
        which encompass the electric particles of which atoms are
        supposed to be formed. All the inertia of bodies --- that is to
        say, their mass, is due to the inertia of the ether. All kinetic
        energy is due to the movements of the ether imprisoned by the
        lines of force which unite it to the atoms. J.J. Thomson, who
        upholds this hypothesis, adds, "that it requires that the
        density of the ether should exceed that of all known bodies"
        ("Electricity and Matter", Westminster, 1904; and "On the
        Dynamics of an Electrified Field", <i>Proc. Cambridge Philos.
          Soc.</i>, 1903, p. 83). Why, however, is not very clear. </p>
      <p>The magnitude of the forces which the ether is able to transmit
        likewise constitutes a phenomenon very difficult to interpret.
        An electromagnet acts across space by the intermediary of the
        ether. Now, as Lord Kelvin has remarked, it exercises on iron at
        a distance a force which may extend to 100 kg/sq. cm. "How is
        it", this physicists writes, "that these prodigious forces are
        developed in the ether, an elastic solid while ponderable bodies
        are yet free to move within this solid?". We do not know and
        cannot say if we ever shall know. </p>
      <p>Hardly anything can be indicated concerning the constitution of
        the ether. Maxwell supposed it to be formed of little spheres
        animated by a very rapid rotary movement, which each transmitted
        to its neighbor. Fresnel considered its elasticity constant, but
        its elasticity variable. Other physicists believe, on the other
        hand, that its density is constant and its elasticity variable.
        For most it is not disturbed by the motions of the material
        systems which pass through it. Others, again, think that, on the
        contrary, it is carried along by them. </p>
      <p>It is, in any case, agreed that the ether is a substance very
        different to matter, and is withdrawn from the laws of gravity.
        It has no weight, is immaterial in the usual acceptation of that
        word, and forms the world of the imponderable. Yet if the ether
        has no gravity it must have mass, since it offers resistance to
        movement. This mass is slight, since the speed of the
        propagation of light is very great. If there were no mass the
        propagation of light would probably be instantaneous. The
        question of the imponderability of the ether, so long debated,
        now seems definitely settled. It has been taken up again
        recently by Lord Kelvin (<i>Philosophical Mag</i>., January
        1902)), and by mathematical calculations which cannot be
        reproduced here, he arrives at the conclusion that the ether
        consists of a substance entirely outside the laws of gravitation
        --- that is to say, imponderable. But he adds, "We have no
        reason to consider it as absolutely incompressible, and we may
        admit that a sufficient pressure would condense it". <br>
        It is probably from this condensation, effected at the beginning
        of the ages by a mechanism totally unknown to us, that are
        derived the atoms, considered by several physicists --- Larmor
        especially --- as condensation nuclei in the ether, having the
        form of small vortices animated with an enormous speed of
        rotation. "The material molecule", writes this physicist, "is
        entirely formed of ether and of nothing els"” (<i>Ether and
          Matter</i>, London 1900). </p>
      <p>Such are the properties that the interpretation of the
        phenomena attributes to the ether. We must confine ourselves to
        stating, without being able to understand it, that we are living
        in an immaterial medium more rigid than steel, to which medium
        we can easily communicate, simply by burning any body whatever,
        movements of which the speed of propagation is 300,000 times
        greater than that of a cannonball. The ether is an agent of
        which we catch glimpses everywhere around us, which we can cause
        to vibrate, to deviate, and which we can measure at will without
        being able to isolate it. Its inmost nature remains an
        irritating mystery. </p>
      <p>We may sum this up by saying that if we know very little about
        the ether, we must, however, consider it certain that the
        greater part of the phenomena in the universe are the
        consequences of its manifestations. It is, no doubt, the source
        and the ultimate end of things, the substratum of the worlds and
        of all beings moving on their surface. I will endeavor to show
        soon how the imponderable ether can be connected with matter and
        thus grasp the link connecting the material with the immaterial.
        As a preparation for understanding their relations, we will
        first examine some of the equilibria it is possible to observe
        in the ether. We only know a small number of these, but those we
        are able to observe will permit us, by analogy, to foresee the
        nature of those unknown to us. </p>

        <p><b><font size="+1">The Different Forms of Equilibrium in the
              Ether</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>The most important phenomena in nature: heat, light,
        electricity, etc., have, as we have just seen, their seat in the
        ether. They are generated by certain perturbations of this
        immaterial fluid on leaving or returning to equilibrium. The
        force of the universe are only known to us, in reality, by
        disturbances of equilibrium. The state of equilibrium
        constitutes the limit beyond which we can no longer follow them.
        Light is only a change of the equilibrium of the ether,
        characterized by its vibration; it ceases to exist so soon as
        the equilibrium is re-established. The electric spark of our
        laboratories, as also the lightning, are simple manifestations
        of the changes of the electric fluid leaving its equilibrium
        from one cause or another, and striving to return to it. So long
        as we knew not how to draw the electric fluid from its state of
        repose its existence was ignored. </p>
      <p>All the modifications of equilibrium produced in the ether are
        very stable and do not survive the cause which gave them birth.
        It is just this which differentiates them from material
        equilibria. The various forms of equilibria observed in matter
        are generally very stable --- that is, they survive the cause
        which generates them. The world of the ether is the world of
        mobile equilibria, while the world of matter is that of
        equilibria which can be fixed. </p>
      <p>To say that a thing is no longer in equilibrium is to state
        that it has undergone certain displacements. The known movements
        which determine the appearance of phenomena are not very
        numerous. They are principally attractions, repulsions,
        rotations, projections, vibrations, and vortices, and of these
        different movements the best known are those which produce
        attractions and repulsions, as they are almost exclusively
        resorted to for the measurement of phenomena. The balance
        measures the attraction exercised on bodies by the earth, the
        galvanometer measures the attraction exercised on a magnet by an
        electric current, the thermometer, the attractions or repulsions
        of the molecules of a liquid submitted to the influence of heat.
        The osmotic equilibria which control most of the phenomena of
        life are revealed by the attractions and repulsions of the
        molecules in the bosom of liquids. The movements of various
        substances and the varieties of equilibrium resulting therefrom
        thus play a fundamental role in the production of phenomena.
        They constitute their essence, and form the only realities
        accessible to us. </p>
      <p>Until the last few years, only the regular vibratory movements
        of the ether which produce light were studied. It might,
        however, have been supposed that a fluid in which, as in a
        liquid, regular waves could be produced, was susceptible of
        other movements. It is now recognized that the ether can be the
        seat of different movements such as projections, vortices, etc.,
        among the forms of the movements in the ether lately studied,
        vortices appear, at least theoretically, to play a preponderant
        part. Larmor and other physicists consider that electrons, the
        supposed elements of the electric fluid --- and, according to
        some scholars, of material atoms --- are vortices or gyrostats
        formed within the ether. Prof. de Heen compares them to a rigid
        wire twisted into a helix, the direction of their rotations
        determining the attractions and repulsions. Sutherland seeks in
        the direction of the movements of these gyrostats the
        explanation of the electrical and thermal phenomena of
        conduction. "Electric conduction", he says, "is due to the
        vibration of the gyrostats in the direction of the electric
        force, and thermal conduction to the vibration of vortices in
        all directions" (Philosophical Mag, May 1904). </p>
      <p>It was mathematical analysis alone which led physicists to
        attribute a fundamental role to the vortices in the ether, but
        experiments made on material fluids give to this hypothesis a
        precise basis, since, as we shall see, they permit the
        reproduction of the attractions and repulsions observed in
        electrical phenomena, and the constitution by vortices of
        material substances with geometric forms. A material vortex may
        be formed by any fluid, liquid or gaseous, turning round an
        axis, and by the fact of its rotation it describes spirals. The
        study of these vortices has been the object of important
        researches by different scholars, notably by Bjerkness and
        Weyher (Sur les tourbillans, Paris 1889). They have shown that
        by them can be produced all the attractions and repulsions
        recognized in electricity, the deviations of the magnetic needle
        by currents, etc. These vortices are produced by the rapid
        rotation of a central rod furnished with pallets, or, more
        simply, of a sphere. Round this sphere gaseous currents are
        established, dissymmetrical with regard to the equatorial plane,
        and the result is the attraction or repulsion of bodies brought
        near to it, according to the position given to them. It is even
        possible, as Weyher has proved, to compel these bodies to turn
        round the sphere as do the satellites of a planet without
        touching it. </p>
      <p>These vortices constitute one of the forms most easily assumed
        by material particles, since a fluid can be caused to whirl by a
        simple breath. They can produce, besides, all the movements of
        rotation, and very stable equilibria capable of striving against
        the power of gravity as a top in motion remains upright on its
        pivot. It is the same with a bicycle, which falls laterally when
        it ceases to roll forward. The helices with vertical axes called
        helicopters used in certain processes of aviation rise in the
        atmosphere by screwing themselves into it so soon as they are
        put in rotation, and remain there so long as that rotation
        lasts. Directly they come to rest, being no longer able to
        struggle against gravity, they fall heavily to the ground. It
        will thus be easily conceived that it is in rotary motion that
        is found the best explanation of the equilibria of atoms. </p>
      <p>It is by whirling movements in the ether that several authors
        also seek to explain gravitation. Prof. A,rmand Gauthier in a
        notice of my memoir on intra-atomic energy gives a similar
        explanation. If it could be considered as definitive, it would
        have the advantage of explaining the way in which the
        imponderable may go forth from the ponderable: </p>
      <p>"The material atom animated by gyratory movements must transmit
        its gyration to the surrounding ether, and by it to the other
        distant material bodies which float in this ether. It follows
        that, when the gyration passes from one to the other, the
        material bodies, by virtue of their own inertia, tend, so to
        speak, to screw themselves one on the other by the intermediary
        of the common vortex of ether in which they are; in a word,
        these material bodies must attract one another. It is sufficient
        thus to admit that there must be a kind of viscosity between the
        particles of the ether, or rather a kind of transport
        (entrainment) of these particles one by the other. </p>
      <p>"But of the gyratory condition of the atomic edifices seems to
        be thus the cause of their mutual attraction --- that is to say,
        of gravity, this latter must disappear wholly or in part if the
        energy of gyration be wholly or in part transformed into energy
        of translation in space. May it not likewise be the same with
        the electron --- that is to say, with the atomuscule torn from
        the atom and launched forth from the material edifice with the
        velocity of the atomical light, in which atomuscule the speed of
        gyration has disappeared because transformed into speed of
        translation? These electrons thus borrowed from matter, if no
        longer in a state of sensible or concordant gyration, may then
        lose all or part of their weight while keeping their mass, and
        while continuing to follow the law which measures the energy
        transported by them by half the product of their mass multiplied
        by the square of their speed of translation" (<i>Revue
          Scientifique</i>, 13 January 1904). </p>
      <p>The experiments on whirling movements in fluids not only
        produce attractions, repulsions, and equilibria of all kinds;
        they may be associated, so as to give birth to regular geometric
        forms as M. Bernard has demonstrated in a series of experiments
        (<i>Revue Generale des Sciences</i>, 1900). He has shown that a
        thin layer of liquid subjected to certain perturbations
        (convection currents bordering on stability) divides itself into
        vertical prisms with polygonal bases that can be rendered
        visible by certain optical processes or by simply mixing with it
        very fine powders. "It is", says this author, "the geometric
        places of neutral vortices which form the plane walls of the
        hexagonal prisms and the vertical axes of these prisms. The
        lines of the whirlpools are closed curves centered on the axis
        of these prisms. The lines of the whirlpools are closed curves
        centered on the axis of these prisms". Metals suddenly chilled
        after having been fixed and cast in layers often divide in the
        same way and present to our observation polygonal cells (1).
        These experiments show is that the molecules of a liquid can
        assume geometrical forms without ceasing to be a liquid. These
        momentary forms of equilibrium do not survive the causes which
        give them birth. They are analogous to those I have been able to
        produce and render visible by properly combining the elements of
        dissociated matter, as we shall see hereafter. </p>
      <p>[(1) According to Prof. Quincke of Heidelberg, all substances
        on passing from the liquid to the solid state, form these cells,
        which he calls "foam cells" --- <i>Proc. Roy. Soc</i>., 21 July
        1906.] </p>
      <p>Although the analogies between the molecules of material fluids
        and those of immaterial fluids are many, they never attain
        identity by reason of two capital differences between material
        and immaterial substances. The former are in fact subject to the
        action of gravity, and have very great mass. They therefore obey
        changes of motion, but rather slowly. The latter are free from
        gravity, and have very small mass, the smallness this mass
        allowing them to take, under the influence of very feeble
        forces, rapid movements, and consequently to be extremely
        mobile. If, in spite of their feeble mass, the immaterial
        molecules can produce fairly great mechanical effects, such as
        are observed, for example, in Crookes’ tubes, the mirrors of
        which become red hot under the action of the cathodic
        bombardment, it is because the smallness of the mass is
        compensated for by their speed. In the formula T = mv<sup>2</sup>
        / 2, without changing the result, <i>m</i> can be reduced at
        will on condition that <i>v</i> is increased. </p>
      <p>By considering the important part played by the divers forms of
        equilibrium of which the ether is capable, it is easy to arrive
        at the conception that matter is nothing but a particular state
        of equilibrium of the ether. Consequently, when we seek in
        future chapters the links which unite material to immaterial
        things, we must especially examine the different forms of
        equilibrium possessed by that intermediary world of which we
        recognize the existence, and inquire into the analogies and
        dissimilarities offered by these equilibria when compared with
        the two worlds which we propose to unite. </p>

              Experiments which Reveal the Dissociation of matter</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p><b>(1) The First Interpretation ~</b> </p>
      <p>The ether and matter form the two extreme limits of the series
        of things. Between these limits, far as they are from each
        other, there exist intermediate elements, of which the existence
        is now revealed by observation. None of the experiments I shall
        set forth, however, will show us the transformation of ether
        into material substances. It would require the disposal of
        colossal energy to effect such a condensation. But the converse
        transformation of matter into the ether, or into substances akin
        to the ether is, on the contrary, realizable, and can be
        realized by the dissociation of matter. It is in the discovery
        first of the cathode rays and then of the x-rays that are found
        the germs of our present theory of the dissociation of matter.
        This dissociation, whether spontaneous or induced, always
        reveals itself by the emission into space of effluves identical
        with the cathode and the x-rays. The assimilation of these two
        orders of phenomena, which for several years I was alone in
        maintaining, is today universally admitted. </p>
      <p>The discovery of the cathode and of the x-rays which invariably
        accompany them, marks one of the most important stages of modern
        science. Without it, the theory of the dissociation of matter
        could never have been established; and without it, we should
        always have been ignorant that it is to this dissociation of
        matter that we owe phenomena long known in physics, but which
        had remained unexplained. Every one knows at the present time
        what the cathode rays are. If through a tube furnished with
        electrodes and exhausted to a high vacuum an electric current of
        sufficient tension be sent, the cathode emits rays which are
        projected in a straight line, which heat such bodies as they
        strike, and which are deviated by a magnet. The metallic cathode
        only serves to render the rays more abundant, since I have
        proved by experiment that with a Crookes’s tube without cathode
        or any trace of metallic matter whatever, exactly the same
        phenomena are observed. </p>
      <p>The cathode rays are charged with electricity, and can traverse
        very thin metallic plates connected with the earth without
        losing their charge. Every time they strike an obstacle they
        immediately give rise to those peculiar rays termed x-rays,
        which differ from the cathode rays in not being deviated by a
        magnet, and pass through thick metallic plates capable of
        completely stopping the cathode rays. Both cathode and x-rays
        produce electricity in all bodies that they meet, whether they
        be gases or solid matter, and consequently render the air a
        conductor of electricity. </p>
      <p>The first ideas of the nature of the cathode rays which were
        conceived were far different from those current today. Crookes,
        who first put in evidence the properties of these rays,
        attributed their action to the state of extreme rarification of
        the molecules of the gas when the vacuum had been carried very
        far. In this "ultra-gaseous" state, the rarified molecules
        represented, according to him, a peculiar state which can be
        described as a fourth state of matter. It was characterized by
        the fact that, no longer hindered in their course by the impact
        of the other molecules, the free trajectory of the rarified
        molecules lengthens to such a point that their reciprocal shock
        becomes of no importance compared with their whole course. They
        can then move freely in every direction, and if their movements
        are directed by an external force such as the electric current
        of the cathode, they are projected in one direction only like
        grapeshot from a cannon. On meeting an obstacle they produce by
        their molecular bombardment the effects of phosphorescence and
        heat, which the experiments of the illustrious physicists put in
        evidence. </p>
      <p>This conception, now recognized to be inexact, was inspired by
        the old kinetic theory of gases which I will thus recapitulate.
        The molecules of gases are formed of perfectly elastic
        particles, a condition necessary to prevent their losing energy
        by impact, and are far enough apart from each other to exercise
        no mutual attraction. They are animated by a speed varying with
        the gas, calculated at about 1800 meters per second in the case
        of hydrogen, or about double that of a cannon-ball. This speed
        is also purely theoretical, for, by reason of their mutual
        impacts, the free path of each molecule is limited to about the
        thousandth part of a millimeter. It is the impact of these
        molecules which produces the pressure exercised by a gas on the
        walls that enclose it. If the space enclosing the same volume of
        molecules be reduced t one-half, the pressure is doubled. It is
        tripled when the space is reduced to one-third. It is this fact
        which is expressed by the law of Mariotte. </p>
      <p>In a globe exhausted to a vacuum of the millionth of an
        atmosphere, things, according to Crookes, happen very
        differently. No doubt it still contains an enormous number of
        gaseous molecules, but the very great reduction in their number
        causes them to obstruct each other reciprocally much less than
        under ordinary pressure, and their free path is thus
        considerably augmented. If, under these conditions, a part of
        the molecules of air remaining in the tube be electrified and
        projected, as I said above, by an intense electric current, they
        may freely traverse space, and acquire an enormous speed, while
        at ordinary pressure, this speed is kept down by the molecules
        of air encountered. </p>
      <p>The cathode rays, therefore, simply represented, in the
        original theory of Crookes, molecules of rarified gas,
        electrified by contact with the cathode, and launched into the
        empty space within the tube at a speed they could never attain
        if they were obstructed, as in gases at ordinary pressure, by
        the impact of other molecules. They were thought to remain,
        however, material molecules, not dissociated, but simply spread
        out, which would not change their structure. No one dreamed, in
        fact, at this epoch that the atome was capable of dissociation.
      </p>
      <p>Nothing remains of Crookes’ theory since the measurement of the
        electric charge of the particles and of their mass has proved
        that they are a thousand times smaller than the atom of
        hydrogen, the smallest atom known. One might doubtless suppose
        in strictness, as was done at first, that the atom was simply
        subdivided into other atoms preserving the properties of the
        matter whence they came; but this hypothesis broke down in face
        of the fact that the most dissimilar gases contained in Crookes’
        tubes gave identical products of dissociation, in which were
        fond none of the properties of the substances from which they
        had issued. It had then to be admitted that the atom was not
        divided, but was dissociated into elements endowed with entirely
        new properties which were identical in the case of all
        substances. </p>
      <p>It was not, we shall see, by any means, in a day that the
        theory of dissociation just briefly indicated was established;
        in fact, it was clearly formulated only after the discovery of
        the radioactive substances and the experiments which helped me
        prove the universality of the dissociation of matter. And it was
        only after several years that physicists at last recognized,
        conformably with my assertions, the identity of the cathode rays
        with the effluves of particles emitted by ordinary substances
        during their dissociation. </p>
      <p><b>(2) The Interpretations Now Current ~</b> </p>
      <p>At the time when only the cathode rays were known, the
        explanation by Crookes of their nature seemed to be quite
        different. On the discovery of the x-rays and of the emissions
        of the spontaneously radioactive bodies, such as uranium, the
        insufficiency of the old theory was made clear. One of the
        manifestations of the x-rays and of the radioactive emissions
        which made the greatest impression on the physicists and was the
        origin of the current explanations, was the production of
        electricity on all bodies both solid and gaseous struck by the
        new radiations. The x-rays and the emissions from radioactive
        bodies possess, in fact, the common characteristic of producing
        something which renders the air and other gases conductors of
        electricity. With these gases thus made conducting we can, by
        passing them between the plates of a condenser, neutralize
        electric charges. It was, as a consequence, admitted that they
        were electrified. </p>
      <p>This was a very unforeseen phenomenon, for all earlier
        experiments had without exception shown that gases were not
        capable of being electrified. They can be kept, in fact,
        indefinitely in contact with a body electrified to a very high
        potential without absorbing any trace of electricity. If it were
        otherwise, no electrified surface --- the ball of an
        electroscope, for instance --- could retain its charge, and we
        were, therefore, in face of an entirely new fact, much more
        novel even than was at first thought, since it implied, in
        reality, the dissociation of matter, which nobody then
        suspected. </p>
      <p>So soon as an unforeseen fact is stated, one always tries to
        connect it with an old theory, and since one theory alone, that
        of the ionization of saline solutions in electrolysis, gives an
        apparent explanation of the newly observed facts, haste was made
        to adopt it. It was therefore supposed that in a simple body
        there exits, as in a compound, two separable elements, the
        positive and negative ions, each charged with electricity of
        contrary sign. But the earlier theory of ionization only applied
        to compound bodies, and not to simple ones. The elements of
        compound bodies could be separated, as we now say, ionized ---
        chloride of potassium, for instance, being capable of separation
        into its chlorine ions and its potassium ions; but what analogy
        could exist between this operation and the dissociation of
        chloride or potassium itself, since it was considered a
        fundamental dogma that a simple body could not be dissociated.
        There was all the less analogy between the ionization of saline
        solutions and that of simple bodies, that, when the elements of
        a salt are separated by the electric current, very different
        bodies are extracted according to the compound dissociated.
        Chloride of potassium, mentioned above, gives chlorine and
        potassium; with sodium oxide, oxygen and sodium are obtained,
        and so on. When, on the other hand, we ionize a simple body, we
        extract from it always the same elements. Whether it be
        hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, aluminum or any other substance, the
        substance extracted is the same, every time. Whatever may be the
        body ionized, and whatever the mode of ionization, one obtains
        only those particles --- ions or electrons --- of which the
        electric charge is the same in all bodies. The ionization of a
        saline solution and that of a simple body, such as a gas, for
        instance, are therefore two things which present, in reality, no
        analogy to each other. </p>
      <p>From the verification of the fact that from simple bodies such
        as oxygen, hydrogen, etc., only the same elements can be
        extracted, it might easily have been deduced: first, that atoms
        can be dissociated; and secondly, that they are all formed of
        the same elements. These conclusions are now evident, but they
        were a great deal too much outside the ideas then dominant for
        any one to dream of formulating them. </p>
      <p>The term ionization when applied to a simple body had no great
        meaning, but it formed the beginning of an explanation, for
        which reason it was eagerly accepted. I shall likewise accept
        it, in order not to confuse the reader’s mind, but at the same
        time shall take care to remark that the term ionization applied
        to a simple body merely means dissociation of its atoms, and not
        anything else. </p>
      <p>Several physicists, it is true, and I am astonished to find
        Rutherford among them, think that the ionization of a gas can
        take place without in any way changing the structure of its
        atoms. One cannot see why that which is admitted to be exact in
        the case of a solid body should be otherwise for a gaseous one.
        We know that by divers means we can dissociate any simple body
        whatever. In the case of radium, aluminum, oxygen, or any other
        substance, the products of this dissociation are particles which
        are admitted to be exactly identical in the case of all bodies.
        There is therefore no foundation for saying that one has
        dissociated some substances and not others. To take something
        from an atom is always to begin its dissociation. Gases, on the
        other hand, are the easiest of all bodies to dissociate, because
        to accomplish this, it is only necessary to pass electric
        discharges through them. </p>
      <p>This ionization of simple bodies --- that is to say, the
        possibility of extracting from them positive and negative ions
        bearing electric charges of opposite signs --- once admitted,
        presented a number of difficulties, which were studiously passed
        over in science, because it is really impossible to find their
        explanation. For these electric ions, or this ionic electricity,
        if I may use the expression, differs singularly in its
        properties from the ordinary electricity which a century of
        researches has made known to us. A few comparisons will suffice
        to show this. On any insulated body whatever we can fix only a
        very small quantity of electricity if it is a solid, and none at
        all if it is a gas. Ionic electricity, on the other hand, must
        necessarily be condensed in immense quantities on infinitely
        small particles. Ordinary electricity, even though it has the
        intensity of lightning, can never pass through a metallic plate
        connected with the earth, as Faraday showed long ago. On this
        classic property there has even been founded the manufacture of
        clothes from light metallic gauze which affords the workmen in
        factories, where electricity at a high potential is produced,
        protection from even the most violent discharges. Ionic
        electricity, on the other hand, easily traverses metallic
        enclosures. Ordinary electricity goes along wire conductors with
        the rapidity of light, but cannot be led like a gas into a
        hollow tube bent back upon itself. Ionic electricity, on the
        other hand, acts like a vapor, and can circulate slowly through
        a tube. And finally, ionic electricity has the property of
        giving birth to the x-rays whenever the ions animated by a
        certain speed happen to touch any body whatever. </p>
      <p>No doubt it can be urged that electricity generated by the
        ionization of matter which has assumed the special form of
        electrical atoms, must possess in this form properties very
        different to ordinary electricity. But then, if the properties
        of the atom called electrical are absolutely different to
        electricity, why call it electrical. In the experiments I shall
        set forth, electricity will most often appear to us as an effect
        and not a cause. It is to this unknown cause what electricity is
        to the heat or the friction which generates it. When a
        rifle-ball or a jet of steam produces electricity by its impact,
        we do not say that this bullet or this jet of steam are
        electricity, nor even that they are charged with it. The idea
        would never enter any one’s head of confounding effect with
        cause as some persist in doing in the case of the radioactive
        emissions. </p>
      <p>The phenomena observed in the dissociation of matter, such as
        the emission of particles having a speed of the order of light
        and the property of generating x-rays, are evidently
        characteristics possessed by none of the known forms of
        electricity, and ought to have led physicists to suppose, as I
        did, that they are certainly the consequence of an entirely new
        form of energy. But the imperious mental need of seeking for
        analogies, of comparing the unknown with the known, has led to
        the connecting of these phenomena with electricity under the
        pretext that among the effects observed one of the most constant
        was the final production of electricity. </p>
      <p>It is plain, however, that several physicists are very near
        arriving by different roads at the conception that all these
        radioactive emissions which it is sought to connect with
        electricity by the theory of ionization, represent
        manifestations of intra-atomic energy --- that is to say, of an
        energy which has no relation to anything known; and the facts
        proving that electricity is only one of the forms of this energy
        are multiplying daily. </p>
      <p>One of the most important of these is the discovery due to
        Rutherford, of which I shall soon have to speak, namely, that
        the greatest part of the particles emitted during radioactivity
        proceed from an emanation possessing absolutely no electric
        charge, though capable of giving birth to bodies able to produce
        electricity. Emanation, ions, electrons, x-rays, electricity,
        etc., are really, as we shall see, only different phases of the
        dematerialization of matter --- that is to say --- of the
        transformation of intra-atomic energy. </p>
      <p>"It seems", wrote Prof. de Heen with regard to my experiments,
        "that we find ourselves confronted by conditions which remove
        themselves from mater by successive stages of cathode and x-ray
        emissions and approach the substance which has been designated
        the ether. The ulterior researches of Gustave Le Bon have fully
        justified his first assertions that all these effects depend
        upon a new mode of energy. This new force is as yet as little
        known as was electricity before Volta. We simply know that it
        exists". </p>
      <p>But whatever may be the interpretations given to the facts
        revealing the dissociation of matter, these facts are
        incontestable, and it is only the demonstration of them which is
        at present of importance. </p>
      <p>On these acts there is almost complete agreement at the present
        time, and it is, the same with the identity of the products of
        the dissociation of matter, whatever be the cause of this
        dissociation. Whether they are generated by the cathode of
        Crookes’ tube, by the radiation of a metal under the action of
        light, or by the radiation of spontaneously radioactive bodies
        such as uranium, thorium, and radium, etc., the effluves are of
        the same nature. They are subject to the same magnetic
        deviation, the relation of their charge to their mass is the
        same. Their speed alone varies, but it is always immense. </p>
      <p>We can, then, when we wish to study the dissociation of matter,
        choose the bodies in which the phenomenon manifests itself most
        intensely --- either, for example, the Crookes’ tube, in which a
        metallic cathode is excited by the electric current of an
        induction coil, or, more simply, very radioactive bodies such as
        the salts of thorium or of radium. Any bodies whatever
        dissociated by light or otherwise give, besides, the same
        results, bit the dissociation being much weaker, the observation
        of the phenomena is more difficult. </p>

        <p><b><font size="+1">The Products of the Dematerialization of
              Matter (Ions, Electrons, Cathode Rays, etc.)</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p><b>(1) Classification of the Products of the Dematerialization
          of Matter ~</b> </p>
      <p>I have set forth in the preceding chapter the genesis of the
        current ideas on the interpretation of the facts relating to the
        dissociation of matter. We will now study the characteristics of
        the products of this dissociation. Not to complicate a subject
        already very obscure, I will accept, without discussion, the
        theories at present admitted, and will confine myself to the
        attempt to state them with more precision, and to bring together
        things which resemble one another, but which are often called by
        different names. </p>
      <p>I have said that, whatever the body dissociated and the mode of
        dissociation employed, the products of this dissociation are
        always of the same nature. Whether it be the emissions of
        radium, of those of any metal under the influence of light, of
        those produced by chemical reaction or by combustion, or of
        those proceeding from an electrified point, etc., the products
        will, as already said, be identical, although their quantity and
        their speed of emission may be very different. </p>
      <p>This generalization has taken a long time to establish. It was,
        consequently, natural that things recognized later on as similar
        after having first been considered as different, should have
        been designated by particular terms. It is therefore clearly
        important to define first of all the exact value of the various
        terms employed. Without exact definitions no generalization is
        possible. The necessity of such definitions makes itself all the
        more felt that the greatest confusion exists in the meaning of
        the terms generally in use. It is easy to see, moreover, why
        this should be so. A new science always gives birth to a new
        terminology. The science is not even constituted until its
        language has been fixed. The recently discovered phenomena
        necessarily compelled the formation of special expressions
        indicating both the facts and the theories inspired by those
        facts. But, these phenomena having been examined by various
        inquirers, the same words have sometimes received very different
        meanings. </p>
      <p>Often words of old standing and possessing a well-defined
        meaning have been used to designate things newly discovered.
        Thus, for instance, the same word ion is used to designate the
        elements separated in a saline solution and those derived from
        the dissociation of simple bodies. Some physicists, like
        Lorentz, use indifferently the terms ions and electrons, which
        to others imply very distinct things. J.J. Thomson calls
        corpuscles [negative electrons] the electric atoms which Larmor
        and other authors call electrons, etc. </p>
      <p>By only taking into account facts revealed by experiments and
        without troubling about the theories from which the definitions
        are derived, we find that the different products of the
        dissociation of matter now known may be arranged in the six
        following classes: (1) Emanations; (2) Negative Ions; (3)
        Positive Ions; (4) Electrons; (5) Cathode Rays; (6) X-rays and
        analogous radiations. </p>
      <p><b>(3) Characteristics of the Elements Furnished by the
          Dissociation of Matter ~</b> </p>
      <p><i>The Emanation</i> ~ This product, which we shall examine at
        greater length in the chapter devoted to the study of
        spontaneously radioactive matter, is a semi-material substance
        having some of the characteristics of a gas, but is capable of
        spontaneously disappearing into electric particles. It was
        discovered by Rutherford in thorium and by Dorn in radium, and
        according to the researched of J.J. Thomson (<i>Cambridge
          Philos. Soc.</i>, April 1904, p. 391) it exists in the
        majority of ordinary bodies: water, sand, stone, clay, etc. It
        may, then, be considered as one of the usual stages of the
        dissociation of matter. </p>
      <p>If we have just styled a semi-material substance "the
        emanation", it is because it possesses at once the properties of
        material bodies and those of bodies which are not material or
        which have ceased to be so. It can be condensed, like a gas, at
        the temperature of liquid air, when, tanks to its
        phosphorescence, its behavior can be watched. It can be kept for
        some time in a sealed glass tube, but it soon escapes by
        transforming itself into electric particles and then ceases to
        be a material. These electric particles comprise positive ions
        (Rutherford’s rays), to which, after a certain time, succeed
        electrons (the same author’s beta rays) and x-rays (gamma rays).
        These various elements will be studied later on. </p>
      <p>Although the “emanation” can produce electric particles by its
        dissociation, it is not charged with electricity. </p>
      <p><i>Positive Ions and Negative Ions</i> ~ Let us recall to mind,
        for the understanding of what is to follow, that, according to a
        theory already old, which has, however, taken a great extension
        in these days, all atoms contain electric particles of
        ascertained size, called electrons. Let us now suppose that a
        body of some kind, a gas for example, is dissociated --- that is
        to say, ionized, as it is called. According to present ideas,
        there would be formed within it positive ions and negative ions
        by a process comprising the three following operations: </p>
      <p>(1) The atom, originally neutral --- that is to say, composed
        of elements which neutralize each other --- loses some of its
        negative electrons. (2) These electrons surround themselves, by
        electrostatic attraction, with some of the neutral molecules of
        the gases around them in the same way that electrified bodies
        attract neighboring ones. This aggregate of electrons and
        neutral particles form the negative ion. (3) The atom, thus
        deprived of part of its electrons, then possesses an excess of
        positive charge, and in its turn surrounds itself with a retinue
        of neutral particles, thus forming the positive ion. Such is ---
        reduced to its essential points --- the present theory which the
        researches of numerous experimenters, especially J.J. Thomson,
        have succeeded in getting adopted, notwithstanding all
        objections raised against it. </p>
      <p>Things, however, only happen in the manner described in a gas
        at ordinary pressure. In a vacuum, electrons do not surround
        themselves with a retinue of material molecules; they remain in
        the state of electrons and can acquire a great speed, so that
        the formation of negative ions is not observed in a vacuum. Nor
        does the positive ion in a vacuum surround itself with neutral
        particles, but, as it is composed of all that is left of the
        atom, it is still voluminous, which is why its speed is
        comparatively feeble. </p>
      <p>It may happen, however, that this is the case with the emission
        from radioactive bodies, that the negative electrons are
        expelled from the atom into the atmosphere, at the ordinary
        pressure, with too great a speed for their attraction on the
        neutral molecule to be capable of exercise. They do not then
        transform themselves into ions, but remain as those emitted in
        vacuo. It is they that form the beta rays of Rutherford. </p>
      <p>The positive ions, notwithstanding their volume, are likewise
        capable of acquiring a very high speed in the case of the
        emission from the radioactive substances. At least, such is the
        result of the researched of Rutherford, who supposes that the
        alpha rays --- which constitute 99% of the emission of radium
        --- are formed of positive ions launched with a speed equal to
        one-tenth that of light. This point demands elucidation by
        further researches. </p>
      <p>When the factors of pressure and speed do not intervene, and
        the negative and positive ions are formed at atmospheric
        pressure, they have about the same bulk. It is only when they
        are generated in vacuo or are emitted with a very high speed
        that their dimensions vary considerably. In vacuo, in fact, the
        electron, as the nucleus of the negative ion, does not, as
        mentioned above, surround itself with material molecules, and
        remains in the state of electron. Its mass, according to several
        measurements of which I shall have to speak elsewhere, does not
        exceed the thousandth part of that of an atom of hydrogen. What
        remains of the atom deprived of a part of its electrons --- that
        is to say, the positive ion --- possesses a mass equal to and
        sometimes greater than that of an atom of hydrogen, and
        consequently at least a thousand times greater than that of the
        electron. </p>
      <p>It is therefore necessary, when treating of the properties of
        ions, to distinguish --- (1) whether they were formed in a gas
        at ordinary pressure; (2) if they were generated in vacuo; (3)
        if, by any cause whatever, they were launched into space at a
        great speed at the moment of their formation. Their properties
        vary according to these different cases, as we shall see in
        other parts of this work. But, in all these different cases, the
        general structure of the ions remains the same. Their
        fundamental nucleus is always formed of electrons --- that is,
        of electric atoms. </p>
      <p>It is natural to suppose that the dimensions and properties of
        the ions formed in a gas at ordinary pressure differ notably
        from those of the electrons, since these latter are supposed to
        be free from all admixture of matter. But it seems difficult, on
        the current theory, to explain some of the properties of the
        ions, especially those which can be observed with simple gases,
        bodies which are easy to ionize by many different means. It is
        noted that they then form in the aggregate an entirely special
        fluid of which the properties are akin to those of a gas,
        without, however, possessing its stability. It can circulate,
        for some time, before being destroyed, through a worm of metal
        connected with the earth, which electricity cold never do. It
        possesses a marked inertia, as its slight mobility proves. Such
        a fluid has properties too peculiar not to have a name given to
        it, for which reason I propose to call it the ionic fluid
        [plasma]. We shall see that, owing to its great inertia, we can
        transform it into very regular geometrical figures. </p>
      <p>As ions are charged with electricity, they can be attracted by
        electrified bodies. This is, in fact, as we shall see later, the
        means of measuring their charges. When an ionized gas is
        enclosed between two metal plates, one of which bears a positive
        and the other a negative charge, the first-named attracts the
        negative and the last the positive ions. If the voltage of these
        plates is weak, part of the ions combine with one another, and
        become neutral, especially when their number is considerable. To
        extract them from the gaseous medium before they combine, it is
        necessary to raise the voltage of the containing vessel until
        the current produced by the circulation of the ions no longer
        increases --- which maximum current is called the "saturation
        current". </p>
      <p>We shall likewise see, in the part of this work devoted to
        experiments, that if ions possess common properties, which allow
        them to be classed in the same family, they also possess certain
        properties which permit them to be sharply differentiated. </p>
      <p><i>Electrons </i>~ The electrons, or electric atoms --- called
        "corpuscles" by J.J. Thomson --- are, as we have seen, the
        nucleus of the negative ion. They are obtained, discharged from
        any foreign element, by means either of Crookes’ tubes (when
        they take the name of cathode rays) or of radioactive bodies
        (when they are termed beta rays). But, in spite of these
        differences of origin, they appear to possess similar qualities.
      </p>
      <p>One of the most striking properties of electrons --- apart from
        that of generating x-rays --- is that of passing through
        metallic plates without losing their electric charge, which, I
        repeat, is contrary to a fundamental property of electricity.
        The most violent discharges are, as is well known, incapable of
        passing through a metallic plate, however thin, connected with
        the earth. </p>
      <p>These electrons, presumed to be atoms of pure electricity, have
        a definite size (and probably also a considerable rigidity).
        They have, whatever their origin, an identical electric charge,
        or can, at least, produce the same neutralization of an amount
        of electricity which is always the same. But we possess no means
        of studying them in repose; and they are only known to us by the
        effects they produce when animated by great speed. </p>
      <p>Their apparent mass --- that is to say, their inertia --- is,
        as we shall see in another chapter, a function of their speed.
        It becomes very great, and even infinite, when this speed
        approaches that of light. Their real mass, if they have one in
        repose, would therefore be only a fraction of the mass they
        possess when in motion. </p>
      <p>The measurements of the inertia of electrons have only been
        made with the negative electrons, the only ones which have yet
        been completely isolated from matter. They have not been
        effective with the positive ions. Being inseparable at present
        from matter, these last must possess its essential property ---
        that is to say, a constant mass independent of speed. </p>
      <p>Electrons in motion behave like an electric current, since they
        are deviated by a magnetic field, and their structure is much
        more complex, in reality, than the above summary would seem to
        indicate. Without going into details, I shall confine myself to
        saying that they are supposed to be constituted by vortices of
        ether analogous to gyroscopes. In repose, they are surrounded by
        rectilinear rays of lines of force. In motion, they surround
        themselves with other line of force --- circular, not
        rectilinear --- from which result their magnetic properties. If
        they are slowed down or stopped in their course they radiate
        Hertzian waves, light, etc. I shall recur to these properties in
        summing up in another chapter the current ideas on electricity.
      </p>
      <p><i>The Cathode Rays</i> ~ As has been said in a preceding
        chapter, physicists have greatly altered their views as to the
        nature of the cathode rays. They are now considered to be
        composed of electrons --- that is to say, of atoms of pure
        electricity disengaged from all material elements. They are
        obtained by various processes, notably by means of radioactive
        substances. The simplest way to produce them in large quantities
        is to send an induction current through a glass bulb furnished
        with electrodes and exhausted to the millionth of an atmosphere.
        As soon as the coil begins to work, there issues from the
        cathode a sheaf of rays, termed cathodic, which can be deviated
        by a magnet. </p>
      <p>The bombardment produced by these rays has as its consequence
        very energetic effects, such as the fusion of metals struck by
        it. From their actions on the diamond, the temperature they
        generate has been calculated at 3500 C. Their power of
        penetration is rather weak, whereas that of the x-rays, which
        are derived from them, is, on the contrary, very great. Lenard,
        who was the first to bring the cathode rays outside a Crookes’
        tube, employed to close the orifice in the tube, a plate of
        aluminum only a few thousandths of a millimeter in thickness. </p>
      <p>A portion of the electric particles constituting the cathode
        rays is charged with negative electricity; the other --- that
        produced in the most central part of the tube --- is composed of
        positive ions. These last have been called "Canal Rays". The
        cathode rays and the canal rays of Crookes’ tubes are of the
        same composition as the alpha and beta radiations emitted by
        radioactive bodies such as radium and thorium. </p>
      <p>Cathode rays possess the property of rendering air a conductor
        of electricity and of transforming themselves into x-rays so
        soon as they meet an obstacle. In the air they diffuse very
        speedily, differing in this from the x-rays, which have a
        strictly rectilinear progress. When Lenard brought the cathode
        rays out of a Crookes’ tube through a plate of thin metal, he
        noted that they formed a widely-spread fan which did not extend
        father than a few centimeters. In very rarified gases it is
        possible, on the other hand, by means of a diaphragm, to confine
        them to a cone free from diffusion for a length of a meter. </p>
      <p>Whatever the gas introduced into a Crookes’ tube before
        creating the vacuum --- a relative vacuum since there still
        remain in it thousands of millions of molecules, even when the
        pressure is reduced to the millionth of an atmosphere --- it is
        noted that the cathode rays which are formed have the same
        properties and the same electric charges. J.J. Thomson has
        concluded from this that the atoms of the most different bodies
        contain the same elements. If, instead of a Crookes’ tube, a
        very radioactive matter, thorium or radium, is used, the
        majority of the proceeding phenomena are found with simply
        quantitative variations. For example, more rays charged with
        negative electricity are found in the Crookes’ tube than in
        those emanations of radium which are especially charged with
        positive electricity; but the nature of the phenomena observed
        in the two cases remains the same. </p>
      <p><i>Speed and Charge of the Cathode and Radioactive Particles</i>
        ~ The measurement of the speed and of the electric charge of the
        particles of which both bodies are found, has proved, as has
        just been said, the cathode rays and the emission from
        radioactive their identity. It would take long to set forth the
        divers methods which have settled these points. Details will be
        found in the memoirs of J.J. Thomson, Rutherford, Wilson, etc..
        I will here indicate very briefly the principle of the methods
        used. </p>
      <p>So far as the speed, which is of the same order as that of
        light, is concerned, it may seem very difficult to measure the
        velocity of bodies moving so quickly;&nbsp; yet it is very
        simple. A narrow pencil of cathodic radiations obtained by any
        means --- for example, from a Crookes’ tube or a radioactive
        body --- is directed onto a screen capable of phosphorescence,
        and on striking it a small luminous spot is produced. This sheaf
        of particles being electrified can be deviated by a magnetic
        field. It can therefore be deflected by means of a magnet so
        disposed that its lines of force are at right angles to the
        direction of the particles. The displacement of the luminous
        spot on the phosphorescent screen indicates the deviation which
        the particles undergo in a magnetic field of known intensity. As
        the force necessary to deviate to a given extent a projectile of
        known mass enables us to determine its speed, it will be
        conceived that it is possible to deduce from the extent of their
        deviation the velocity of the cathodic particles. It is seldom
        less than one-tenth that of light, or say 30,000 kilometers per
        second, and sometimes rises to nine-tenths. When the pencil of
        radiations contains particles of different speed, they trace a
        line more or less long on the phosphorescent screen instead of a
        simple point, and thus the speed of each can be calculated. </p>
      <p>To ascertain the number, the mass, and the electric charge ---
        or at least the ratio e/m of the charge to the mass --- of the
        cathode particles, the procedure is as follows: The first thing
        is to ascertain the electric charge of an unknown number of
        particles contained in a known volume of gas. A given quantity
        of gas containing the radioactive particles is then enclosed
        between two parallel metallic plates, the one insulated and the
        other positively charged. The positive particles are repelled
        towards the insulated plate, while the negative particles are
        attracted, and their charge can be measured by the electrometer.
        From this total charge, the charge of each particle can
        evidently be deduced if the number of particles can be
        ascertained. </p>
      <p>There are several modes of arriving at this number. The most
        simple, first used by J.J. Thomson, is based on the fact that
        when cathode particles are introduced into a reservoir
        containing water-vapor, each particle acts as a condensation
        nucleus for the vapor and forms a drop. The result is a cloud of
        small drops. These latter are far too small to be counted, but
        their number may be determined from the time they take to fall
        through the recipient containing them, the fall being very slow
        owing to the viscosity of the air. When one knows the number of
        these small drops, and consequently the number of cathode
        particles contained in a given volume of water vapor, and also
        the electric charge of all the particles, a simple sum in
        division gives the electric charge of each particle. </p>
      <p>It is by working in this way that it has been possible to
        demonstrate that the electric charge of the cathode particles
        was constant whatever their origin (particles of radioactive
        bodies, of ordinary metals struck by light, etc.). Their
        electric charge is represented by about 10^8 electromagnetic
        units. The value e/m of the ion of hydrogen in the electrolysis
        of liquids being only equal to 10^5, it follows that the mass of
        the negative ion in dissociated bodies is the thousandth part of
        the atom of hydrogen, the smallest atom known. </p>
      <p>The preceding figures only apply to negative ions. They are the
        only ones of which the size is constant for all substances. As
        to the positive ions which contain the greater part of the
        undissociated atom, their charge naturally varies according to
        the substance. Their dimensions are never less than those of the
        hydrogen atom. </p>
      <p><i>The X-Rays</i> ~ When the cathode rays --- that is to say,
        the electrons emitted by a Crookes’ tube or by a radioactive
        body, meet an obstacle, they give birth to special radiations
        called x-rays when they come from a Crookes’ tube, and gamma
        rays when emitted by a radioactive body. These radiations travel
        in a straight line, and can pass through dense obstacles. They
        are not reflected, refracted, nor polarized, and this absolutely
        differentiates them from light. They are not deviated by a
        magnet, and this separates them sharply from the cathode rays,
        whose power of penetration is, besides, infinitely more feeble.
        The x- or gamma-rays possess the property of rendering air a
        conductor of electricity, and consequently of dissipating
        electric charges. They render phosphorescent various substances,
        and impress photographic plates. </p>
      <p>When the x-rays strike any substance whatever, they cause the
        formation of what are called secondary rays, identical with the
        cathode rays; this simply means that x-rays derived from the
        dissociation of matter have the property of producing a further
        dissociation of matter when they come into contact with it, a
        property which luminous radiations, notably those of the
        ultraviolet region, likewise possess (1). </p>
      <p>[(1) For further particulars of this analogy see C. Sagnac, <i>L’Optique
des










          Rayons X</i>, p. 140, Paris 1900] </p>
      <p>Notwithstanding the researches of hundreds of physicists ever
        since their discovery, our knowledge concerning x-rays is almost
        solely confined to the notice of the attributes described; and
        as they have no relation to anything known, they can be
        assimilated to nothing (2). </p>
      <p>[(2) Prof. Soddy compares them to light, both being, according
        to him, pulses in the ether, and attributes the impossibility of
        their polarization, etc., to the fact that, unlike light, they
        are "sudden pulses very rapidly dying away" instead of regular
        successive undulations.] </p>
      <p>It has been sought, however, to connect them with ultraviolet
        light, from which they would only differ by the extreme
        smallness of their wavelength. This hypothesis seems to have but
        small grounds for support. Without going into the speed which
        the cathode rays must possess to impart to the ether vibrations
        corresponding to those of light, and leaving on one side the
        absence of polarization and of refraction which would be
        justified by the smallness of the supposed waves, it is curious
        to observe that the more one advances into the ultraviolet
        region, and the nearer one consequently gets to the supposed
        wavelength of the x-rays, the less penetrating do the radiations
        become. In the extreme limit to the spectrum they end by being
        no longer able to overcome the slightest obstacle. For the
        extreme violet spectrum in the neighborhood of 0.160&nbsp; to
        0.1 microns, so lately studied by Schumann and Lenard, two
        centimeters of air are as opaque as lead, as is a sheet of mica
        the hundredth of a millimeter in thickness. Now, the x-rays,
        supposed to be so near to this extreme region of the
        ultraviolet, pass, on the contrary, through all obstacles, thick
        metal plates included. If they did not possess fluorescence and
        photographic action, no one would have dreamed of comparing them
        to ultraviolet light. </p>
      <p>The impossibility of giving to the x-rays that deviation by a
        magnetic field which the cathode rays undergo, has caused them
        to be looked upon as no longer possessing any electricity, but
        this conclusion may easily be contested. Suppose, in fact, that
        the x-rays are constituted of electric atoms still more minute
        than the ordinary negative electrons, and that their speed of
        propagation borders on that of light. According to the
        researches to be presently mentioned, electrons having such a
        velocity would have an infinite mass. Their resistance to motion
        being infinite, it is evident that they could not be deviated by
        a magnetic field, though composed of electric elements. </p>
      <p>What now seems to be most evident is that there is no more
        reason to connect the x-rays with electricity than with light.
        Assimilations such as these are the offspring of that habit of
        mind which induces us to connect new things with those
        previously known. The x-rays simply represent one of the
        manifestations of intra-atomic energy liberated by the
        dissociation of matter. They constitute one of the stages of the
        vanishing of matter, a form of energy having its own
        characteristics, which must be defined solely by these
        characteristics without endeavoring to fit it into previously
        arranged categories. The universe is full of unknown forces
        which, like the x-rays of today, and the electricity of a
        century ago, were discovered only when we possessed reagents
        capable of revealing them. Had phosphorescent bodies and
        photographic plates been unknown, the existence of x-rays could
        not have been verified. Physicists handled Crookes’ tubes, which
        yield these rays in abundance, for a quarter of a century
        without discovering them. </p>
      <p>If it is probable that the x-rays have their seat in the ether,
        it seems certain that they are not constituted by vibrations
        similar to those of light. To me, they represent the extreme
        limit of material things, one of the last stages of the
        vanishing of matter before its return to the ether. </p>
      <p>Having sufficiently described, according to present ideas, the
        supposed constitution of the products given off by matter during
        its dissociation, we will now study the various forms of this
        dissociation, and show that we shall everywhere meet again the
        elements just enumerated. </p>

        <p><b><font size="+1">The Dematerialization of Very Radioactive
              Substances --- Uranium, Thorium, Radium Etc.</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p><b>(1) The Products of the Dematerialization of Very
          Radioactive Substances ~</b> </p>
      <p>We are about to relate, in this chapter, the researches which
        have been effected on very radioactive substances --- that is to
        say, upon substances which dissociate spontaneously and rapidly.
        Among the products of their dematerialization we shall again
        meet with those which are given off by any substance dissociated
        by any means, but the products emitted will be much greater in
        quantity. Under different names we shall still find the
        emanation, ions, electrons, and x-rays. </p>
      <p>It must not be thought that these substances represent all the
        stages of the dematerialization of matter. Those of which the
        existence is known are only parts of what is probably a very
        long series. If we always meet with the same elements in the
        products of all bodies subjected to dissociation, it is because
        the reagents actually in use, being only sensitive to certain
        substances, are naturally unable to reveal others. When we
        discover other reagents, we shall certainly note the existence
        of other elements. </p>
      <p>The very great interest of the spontaneously radioactive
        substances consists in their emitting, ion considerable
        quantity, elements which other bodies only produce in much
        smaller quantity. By thus enlarging a general phenomenon, they
        permit of its being studied more in detail. </p>
      <p>In this chapter we shall simply set forth the researches on
        eminently radioactive bodies, thorium and radium in particular.
        It is as yet a very new subject, and for that reason the results
        obtained will offer many contradictions and uncertainties. Their
        importance is, however, paramount. </p>
      <p>Rutherford, who has studied the radioactive substances with
        great success, and has, with Curie, discovered nearly all the
        facts concerning them, has designated their radiations by the
        letters alpha, beta, and gamma, which are now generally adopted.
        But under these new appellations are found exactly the products
        we have described. The alpha radiations are composed of positive
        ions, the beta radiation of electrons identical with those
        constituting the cathode rays, while the gamma radiations are
        similar to the x-rays. These three kinds of radiations are very
        clearly indicated in the diagram given in Figure 3. </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="fig3.jpg" height="374" width="251"></p>
      </center>
      <p>To these several radiations is joined, as a primary phenomenon,
        according to Rutherford, the emission of a semi-material
        substance, which he terms "emanation". It possesses no electric
        charge, but would appear to undergo subsequent stages of
        dissociation, which change it into alpha and beta particles. We
        will now examine the properties of the products we have just
        enumerated. For the most part, we shall only have to repeat or
        complete what has been said in a previous chapter. </p>
      <p><b>(2) Alpha Rays, or Positive Ions ~</b> </p>
      <p>The alpha rays are formed of positive ions. They are deviated
        by an intense magnetic field, but in a contrary direction to the
        beta rays. The radius of curvature of their deviation is 1000
        times greater than that of the beta particles. They form 99% of
        the total radioactivity of radium. They render air a conductor
        of electricity. Their action on a photographic plate is much
        less than that of the beta rays, and their force of penetration
        very slight, since they are stopped by a sheet of paper. This
        weak power of penetration enables them to be easily
        differentiated from the other radiations to which paper is no
        obstacle. Of all the emissions of radioactive bodies it is the
        alpha rays especially which make the air a conductor of
        electricity, and it is the beta rays which produce photographic
        impressions. When a radioactive body is enclosed in a glass tube
        nearly all the alpha particles are stopped by the glass walls. </p>
      <p>It is supposed, from various calculations, that the alpha
        particles must have a mass equal or superior to that of the
        hydrogen atom and a like charge. Their speed, as calculated from
        the extent of their deviation by a magnetic field of given
        intensity, is one-tenth that of light. Their quantity varies
        according to the substance. For uranium and thorium it is, for
        one gram, 70,000 per second, and for radium a hundred thousand
        millions. This emission may last without interruption for more
        than a hundred years. </p>
      <p>The emission of the alpha particles, otherwise positive ions,
        is, together with the production of the emanation, the
        fundamental phenomenon of radioactivity. The emission of beta
        particles and that of the gamma rays, which altogether form
        hardly one percent of the total emission, should represent a
        further stage in the dissociation of radioactive atoms. </p>
      <p>On striking phosphorescent bodies the alpha particles render
        them luminous. It is on this property that is based the
        spinthariscope, an instrument which renders visible the
        permanent dissociation of matter. It simply consists of a screen
        of zinc sulfide, above which is placed a small metal rod, the
        end of which has been dipped in a solution of radium chloride.
        On examining the screen through a magnifying glass, there can be
        seen spurting out without cessation a shower of sparks produced
        by the impact of the alpha particles, and this emission may last
        for centuries, which shows the extreme smallness of the
        particles coming from the disaggregation of atoms. If this
        emission is visible, as Crookes says, because "each particle is
        made apparent solely through the enormous degree of lateral
        perturbation produced by its shock on the sensitive surface, in
        the same way that raindrops falling into the water produce
        ripples which exceed their diameter". I have succeeded, by using
        certain varieties of phosphorescent sulfide, in making screens
        allowing the phenomenon of dissociation to be observed, not only
        with salts of radium, but also with divers substances, notably
        thorium and uranium (1). </p>
      <p>[(1) The phosphorescent sulfide is spread in a layer, so thin
        as to be transparent, on a strip of glass first covered with
        varnish. The side coated with phosphorescent matter is then
        placed on the substance it is desired to examine, and the other
        face of the glass is observed through a magnifying glass. All
        uranium and thorium minerals, and even an ordinary incandescent
        mantle, give out a luminescent scintillation indicating a
        dissociation of matter; but in order to see this, it is
        necessary that the eye be rendered sensitive by previously
        remaining in the dark for a quarter of an hour.] </p>
      <p>The high speed of the alpha particle seems very difficult to
        explain. This speed is intelligible enough in the case of the
        beta rays, which, being composed of atoms of pure electricity,
        and having, no doubt, a very small inertia, can acquire a very
        high speed under the influence of very minute forces; but for
        the alpha particles, whose dimensions would appear to be
        identical with that of the hydrogen atom, a velocity of 30,000
        kilometers/second seems to be very difficult to explain, and I
        think that, on this point, the experiments of Rutherford and his
        pupils should be taken up anew (2). </p>
      <p>[(2) it seems possible that this high speed can be explained by
        supposing that, although the alpha particles are being
        constantly emitted, it is only when they reach a certain
        velocity that their existence can be recognized by us. Thus,
        Strutt in reviewing Prof. Rutherford’s Radio-Activity (2nd ed.),
        says: "Ordinary matter may be emitting as many or more alpha
        particles than uranium, if only their velocity is less than that
        minimum velocity which has been found necessary to produce the
        characteristic phenomenon". (<i>Nature</i>, 25 January 1906)] </p>
      <p>It is hardly to be supposed, moreover, that these velocities
        are produced instantaneously; they are only comprehensible on
        the hypothesis that the particles of atoms can be compared to
        small planetary systems animated with enormous velocities. They
        would preserve their speed on leaving their orbits as does a
        stone launched from a sling. The invisible speed of rotation of
        the elements of the atom would therefore be simply transformed
        into a speed of projection visible or in any case perceptible by
        our instruments. </p>
      <p><b>(3) The Beta Rays or Negative Electrons ~</b> </p>
      <p>Beta rays are considered to be composed of electrons identical
        with those of the cathode rays. They should, therefore, be
        formed of negative electric atoms, freed from all matter. Their
        mass should be, like that of the cathode particles, the
        thousandth part of that of the hydrogen atom. Their velocity
        should vary between 33% and 96% of that of light. </p>
      <p>They are emitted in a much smaller proportion than that of the
        alpha particles, since they hardly form 1% of the total
        radiation. It is these rays which produce photographic
        impressions. </p>
      <p>Their penetrating power is considerable. While the alpha rays
        are arrested by a sheet of ordinary paper, the beta rays will
        traverse several millimeters of aluminum. It is probably by
        reason of their great speed that they are much more penetrating
        than the cathode rays of a Crookes’ tube, which can only pass
        through sheets of aluminum of a thickness of some thousandths of
        a millimeter. </p>
      <p>They immediately render luminous by impact bodies capable of
        phosphorescence, even when separated from them by a thin plate
        of aluminum. The phosphorescence is very bright in barium
        platinocyanide and those kind of diamonds --- rather rare,
        by-the-by --- which are capable of phosphorescence (1) </p>
      <p>[(1) It is this very property which I have taken as a basis for
        the measurement of the intensity of the various samples of
        radium I have had occasion to examine. When the tube containing
        a salt of radium renders a diamond phosphorescent through a thin
        strip of aluminum, this salt may be regarded as very active.
        Brazilian diamonds alone --- Cape diamonds never --- are
        utilizable for this experiment. The first, in fact, are capable
        of phosphorescence by light and the second are not so. I have
        proved this by experiments extending to many hundreds of
        samples, details of which are given in my memoir on
        phosphorescence. </p>
      <p>The beta particles seem to be somewhat complex, as is proved by
        the different speeds of their composing elements. This
        inequality of speed is easily recognized by the extent of the
        photographic impression they produce when submitted to the
        action of a magnetic field. It is likewise noticed, by covering
        the photographic plates with screens of varying thickness, that
        different alpha and beta particles possess different powers of
        penetration. It is therefore very probable that they represent
        well-marked stages of the dissociation of matter which we are
        not at present able to distinguish. </p>
      <p><b>(4) The Gamma or X Rays ~</b> </p>
      <p>Together with the alpha and beta rays, the first charged with
        positive, and the second with negative electricity, radioactive
        bodies emit an extremely slight proportion (less than 1%) of
        gamma rays, entirely analogous, as to their properties, to the
        x-rays, but possessing a higher power of penetration, since they
        can traverse several centimeters of steel. This property enables
        them to be easily distinguished from the alpha and beta rays,
        which are stopped by a lead plate a few millimeters thick. Their
        nature is otherwise but little known, and if they are said to be
        analogous to the x rays, it is solely because they are not
        deviated by a magnetic field and possess great penetrating
        power. </p>
      <p>What complicates to a singular degree the study of the above
        emissions (alpha, beta and gamma) is that none of them can touch
        a gaseous or a solid body without immediately causing --- no
        doubt through the disturbance produced by their enormous
        velocity --- a dissociation resulting in the production of rays
        called secondary, which are similar in their properties to the
        primary rays, but less intense. These secondary radiations also
        impress photographic plates, render the air a conductor of
        electricity, and are deviated by a magnetic field. They are able
        to produce, by their impact, tertiary rays having the same
        properties and so on. It is the secondary rays produced by the
        gamma rays which are the most active. A photographic impression
        through a metallic plate is sometimes intensified by the
        interposition of that plate, because the action of the secondary
        rays is then superposed on that of the primary rays. </p>
      <p><b>(5) Semi-Material Emanation Proceeding from the Radioactive
          Substances ~</b> </p>
      <p>One of the most curious properties of the radioactive and,
        moreover, of all substances, is that of incessantly emitting a
        non-electrified product, designated by Rutherford as the
        emanation. This emanation represents the first stages of the
        dissociation of matter, and, by its disaggregation, generates
        emissions of the particles studied in the preceding paragraph.
        To this emanation is also due the property possessed by radium
        of rendering radioactive all bodies placed in its neighborhood.
      </p>
      <p>The emanation has bee especially studied in the case of radium
        and thorium. Uranium does not give enough of it to be revealed
        by reagents. It ism however, very probable that, contrary to the
        opinion of Rutherford, it does disengage an emanation, since,
        according to the researches of J.J. Thomason, the majority of
        bodies in nature, water, sand, etc., produce one also. </p>
      <p>The emanation can be drawn from any radioactive bodies, either
        by dissolving them in any liquid placed in a receiver
        communicating with a closed tube, or by bringing them to a red
        heat in a similar apparatus. The emanation drawn into the tube
        renders it phosphorescent by its presence, which fact allows of
        its behavior being examined. It can be condensed by the cold
        produced by liquid air. This condensation is revealed by the
        localization of the phosphorescence, but no substance capable of
        being measured by the balance appears. As the emanation of
        thorium condenses at 120° C, and that of radium at 150° C, it
        seems very likely that the emanations of different bodies, some
        resemblances notwithstanding, display various properties. </p>
      <p>At the ordinary temperature radioactive bodies in a solid state
        emit the emanation, but only a hundredth part of the quantity
        emitted in the state of solution. </p>
      <p>By introducing zinc sulfide into a bulb containing a solution
        of radium chloride, the disengagement of the emanation renders
        the sulfide phosphorescent. Radium, when heated, loses the
        greater part of its activity by reason of the quantity of
        emanation it gives off, but it regains it entirely in 20 days or
        so. The same loss occurs when a solution of this salt is heated
        to boiling. </p>
      <p>When solid radium chloride has been brought to a red heat, or a
        solution of it has been boiled for some time, it still preserves
        a quarter of its primary activity, but this latter is then
        solely due to the alpha particles, as can be noted by the weak
        penetrating power of the rays emitted, which can no longer pass
        through a sheet of paper. It is only after a certain lapse of
        time that the appearance of the beta rays, capable of passing
        through metals, again takes place. The activity of the emanation
        os lost rather quickly. The rapidity of this loss varies
        according to the substance. That of actinium os destroyed in a
        few seconds, that of thorium in a few minutes, that of radium
        only at the end of three weeks, but it is already reduced by
        one-half in four days. </p>
      <p>According to Rutherford, radium and thorium produce different
        kinds of emanation, that is, of dissociations which begin with
        the emission of the emanations. He has already counted five or
        six belonging to the last. The first engenders the second, and
        so on. They no doubt represent successive stages of the
        dematerialization of matter. </p>
      <p>To the emanation are due three fourths of the heat incessantly
        produced by radium, which maintains its temperature at 3° or 4°
        C. above the ambient medium. If, in fact, radium be deprived of
        its emanation by heating, it gives out no more than a quarter of
        the heat it emitted at first. Almost all the rise in temperature
        is due to the alpha particles. </p>
      <p>It results, as I have already remarked, from the experiments of
        Ramsay, that if some emanation of radium is left for some days
        in a tube, there can be observed the spectral lines of helium
        which were not there in the first instance. </p>
      <p>Before drawing too many conclusions from this transformation,
        it must be remarked that helium is a gas which accompanies all
        radioactive minerals. It was even from these bodies that it was
        first obtained. This gas enters into no chemical combination
        (1), while it is the only substance hitherto found impossible to
        liquefy and can be kept for an indefinite time in the tubes in
        which it is enclosed. </p>
      <p>[(1) Except cadmium] </p>
      <p>This derivative of radium must be a very special helium since
        it appears to possess the property of spontaneously vanishing.
        Its sole resemblance to ordinary helium would seem to consist in
        the momentary presence of some spectral rays. It therefore seems
        very difficult to admit the transformation of radium into
        helium. </p>
      <p>Rutherford considers the emanation as a material gas, because
        it can be diffused and condensed in the manner of gases. No
        doubt the emanation has some properties in common with material
        bodies, but dies it not curiously differ from these last by its
        property of vanishing in a few days, even when enclosed in a
        sealed tube, by transforming itself into electric particles?
        Here especially is shown the utility of the notion we have
        endeavored to establish, of an intermediary between the material
        and the immaterial --- that is to say, between matter and the
        ether. </p>
      <p>The emanation of the radioactive bodies represents, according
        to me, one of these intermediate substances. It is partly
        material, since it can be condensed and dissolved in certain
        acids and recovered by evaporation. But it is only incompletely
        material, since it ends by entirely disappearing and
        transforming itself into electric particles. This
        transformation, which takes place even in a sealed glass tube,
        has been proved by the experiments of Rutherford. He has shown
        that in disappearing the emanation at first gives birth to alpha
        particles and only later to beta particles and gamma radiation.
      </p>
      <p>To prove that the emanation of radium or of thorium only
        generate at first positive or alpha particles, it is placed in a
        brass cylinder 0.05 mm thick, which retains all the alpha
        particles, but allows the beta particles and gamma rays to pass
        through. By noting at regular intervals by means of an
        electroscope the external radiation of the cylinder, it can be
        seen that it is only at the end of three or four hours that the
        beta particles appear. The alpha particles, on the contrary,
        show themselves at once, as is proved by their action on an
        electroscope connected with the interior of the cylinder. </p>
      <p>Rutherford concludes form his experiments that “the emanation”
        at first emits only alpha rays, then beta and gamma rays by
        deposition the walls of the containing cylinder. It is difficult
        to conceive, from all we know of electricity, an emission of
        solely positive particles without a similar negative charge
        being produced at the same time. </p>
      <p>However that may be, if the above theory be correct, the
        emanation in disappearing first produces positive ions
        relatively voluminous, then negative electrons, a thousand times
        less so, and finally gamma radiations. </p>
      <p>Rutherford considers the emanation to be a sort of gas capable
        of spontaneously dissociating into electric particles expelled
        with immense velocity. In the course of dissociation this
        supposed gas would emit 3,000,000 times the amount of energy
        produced by the explosion of an equal amount of hydrogen and
        oxygen mixed in the proportions required for the formation of
        water. This last reaction is, however, as is well known, that
        which produces most heat. </p>
      <p>Is this emanation, which produces so large a quantity of
        electrified particles, itself electrified? In no way. Rutherford
        asserts this positively, but this important point has been very
        clearly demonstrated by the researches of Prof. MacClelland.
        "The fact", he says, "that the emanation is not charged has an
        important significance from the point of view of our conception
        of the manner in which the radium atom destroys itself. The
        radium atom assuredly produces alpha particles charged
        positively. But the particles of the emanation cannot be what
        remains of the atom after the emission of the alpha particles,
        for, in that case, they would be charged negatively". There
        results from these experiments and the observations previously
        made by me that everything relating to the alpha particles,
        which form 99% of the emission of radioactive bodies, requires
        to be entirely re-examined. </p>
      <p><b>(6) Induced Radioactivity ~</b> </p>
      <p>It is the emanation which, by freeing itself and by projecting
        its disaggregated particles on the surface of other bodies,
        produces the so-called induced radioactivity. This phenomenon
        consists in all substances placed in the neighborhood of a
        radioactive compound becoming momentarily radioactive. They do
        not become so if the active salt is enclosed in a glass tube.
        The beta and gamma rays are alone capable of producing induced
        radioactivity. The alpha particles do not seem to possess this
        power. Radioactivity, artificially provoked in any substance,
        disappears only after a fairly long time. </p>
      <p>All glass or metals placed close to a radioactive substance or
        on which is blown, by means of a long tube, the emanation which
        it disengages, become momentarily radioactive. If it be admitted
        that this radioactivity is generated by the freeing of electric
        particles, it must be supposed that these particles are capable
        of being carried along by the air and of attaching themselves
        like dust to other bodies, and possess properties singularly
        different from those of ordinary electricity. Rutherford has
        verified the fact that the emanations of thorium can pass
        through water and sulfuric acid without losing their activity.
        If a metallic wire charged with negative electricity be exposed
        to the emanations of thorium, it becomes radioactive; if this
        wire be treated with sulfuric acid and the residuum then
        evaporated, it will be found that this latter is still
        radioactive. One really does not see how electricity could bear
        such treatment. </p>
      <p>The induced radioactivity communicated to an inactive substance
        may be much more intense than that of the radioactive substance
        from which it emanates. When, in an enclosed vessel, containing
        some emanation from a radioactive body --- thorium, for example,
        a metal plate charged with negative electricity at a high
        potential is introduced, all the particles emitted by the
        thorium concentrate themselves upon it, and, according to
        Rutherford, this plate becomes 10,000 times more active, surface
        for surface, than the thorium itself. These facts are not, any
        more than the preceding ones, explicable by the current theory.
      </p>
      <p>If a metal, rendered artificially radioactive, be brought to a
        white heat, it loses its radioactivity, which spreads itself
        over the bodies in its neighborhood. Here again, we see the
        so-called electric atoms behave in a very strange manner. </p>
      <p>The phenomenon of induced radioactivity is, then, quite
        inexplicable with the current ideas as to electric particles. It
        cannot be admitted that such particles deposited on a metal can
        be carried along by reagents. It would seems, from M. Curie’s
        experiments, that bismuth, plunged into a solution of radium
        bromide and carefully washed immediately, remains radioactive
        for at least three years. Can it be considered likely that
        electric particles act in such a manner? And, since they act so
        differently from electricity, how is it possible, as I have sp\o
        often repeated, to persist in applying to them the term
        "electric" atoms? </p>
      <p>I must remark with respect to induced radioactivity that
        certain forms of energy can be stored in bodies for a great
        length of time and expend themselves very slowly. In my former
        experiments on phosphorescence I noted that calcium sulfide,
        exposed to the sun for a few seconds, radiates invisible light
        for 18 months, as is proved by the possibility of photographing
        the insolated object in the dark room or in the most complete
        darkness. At the end of 18 months it no longer gives any
        radiation, but still preserves a residual charge which persists
        for an indefinite period, and can be made visible by causing
        invisible infrared rays to fall on the surface of the insolated
        body. </p>
      <p>A radioactive body has been compared to a magnet which keeps
        its magnetism forever, and can, without losing its power,
        magnetize other bodies. There is little foundation for this
        comparison, for the magnet is not the seat of a constant
        emission of particles into space (1). It might, however, be
        employed to explain roughly the phenomenon of induced
        radioactivity, which could be reduced to the fact that a
        radioactive body imparts its properties to a neighboring body,
        as the lodestone gives magnetism to fragments of iron near it.
        If the molecules of air were magnetic --- and they are so in a
        slight degree, we should have a gas [radon], which, like the
        emanation of radioactive bodies, would be able to circulate in
        tubes and remain persistently on the surface of a metal without
        losing its properties. </p>
      <p>[(1) M. Vallard’s experiments, however, have given him some
        reason to think that an electromagnet may, under certain
        conditions, actually emit particles of magnetism which he calls
        "magnetons". See <i>Revue Generale des Sciences</i>, 15 May
        1905.] </p>
      <p>From all that has been set forth above one general
        consideration emerges, and this confirms what has been said at
        the commencement of this chapter --- namely, that the stages of
        the dissociation of matter must be extremely numerous and that
        but few of them are yet known to us. Without being able to
        isolate them, we are at least certain that they exist. Since the
        unequal deviation of the beta particles by a magnet proves
        clearly that these are composed of different elements. We
        equally know that, in the semi-material product designated under
        the general name of emanation, already four or five very
        different stages of the dissociation of matter may be noted. </p>
      <p>The same experiments equally confirm this other view --- that
        mater, in dissociating, emits particles, more and more subtle,
        more and more dematerialized, which progressively lead to the
        ether. They themselves represent varied stages of dissociation,
        since their unequal deviation of the same magnetic field proves
        that they are composed of different elements. Finally, we come
        to the gamma radiations, which are no longer stayed by any
        obstacle, which no magnetic attraction can deviate, and which
        seem to constitute one of the last phases of the dissociation of
        matter before its final return to the ether. </p>

              Methods Employed to Verify It</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>Many years&nbsp; have elapsed since I proved that the
        dissociation of matter observed in the substances called
        radioactive, such as uranium and radium, was, contrary to the
        ideas then accepted, a property belonging to all bodies in
        nature, and capable of manifesting itself under the influence of
        the most <br>
        varied causes and even spontaneously. The spontaneous
        radioactivity of certain substances, such as uranium and
        thorium, which has so taken physicists by surprise, is in
        reality a universal phenomenon and a fundamental property of
        matter. </p>
      <p>In a recent study (<i>Proc. Cambridge Philos. Soc</i>., April
        1904, p. 391), Prof. J.J. Thomson has again taken up this
        question, and has succeeded in showing the existence of
        radioactivity in most bodies --- water, sand, clay, brick, etc.
        He has drawn from them an "emanation" which is produced in a
        continuous manner, similar to that extracted by Rutherford from
        radium and having the same properties of radioactivity (1). </p>
      <p>[(1) M. Blondlot, the well-known prof. from Nancy, on the other
        hand, has since made experiments that go to show that an
        emission capable of increasing the light of a phosphorescent
        screen, which can be activated by a magnetic or electric field
        or a draught of air, is emitted at ordinary temperatures by
        copper, silver, zinc, damped cardboard, all liquids, odorous
        substances such as camphor and musk, and the human body. See <i>Comptes
Rendu










          Acad. Sci. Paris</i> 13 and 27 June, 4 and 25 July 1904.] </p>
      <p>These experiments confirm all those I had already published on
        the spontaneous dissociation of matter, but they in no way
        prove, as Elster and Geitel would believe, that there is radium
        everywhere (1). It was the only explanation to which the last
        partisans of the indestructibility of matter could attach
        themselves. To admit that the atoms of two or three exceptional
        bodies can be dissociated is less embarrassing than to
        acknowledge that there is a question of an absolutely general
        phenomenon. </p>
      <p>[(1) See also: <i>Physikalische Zeitschrifte</i>, 15 January
        1906] </p>
      <p>My experiments, moreover, take away all verisimilitude from
        such explanations. When we succeed in varying enormously the
        radioactivity of a body by certain chemical reactions, when we
        render greatly radioactive, by admixture, substances such as tin
        and mercury, which apart are not so, is it really possible to
        imagine that radium can have anything to do with the
        radioactivity then observed? </p>
      <p>It was only thanks to long and minute experiments that I was
        able to establish the universality of the dissociation of
        matter. Some of these will be set forth in the second part of
        this work. Here only a summary of the results obtained will be
        given. </p>
      <p>What phenomena now can be relied upon for the demonstration of
        the dissociation of the particularly radioactive substances,
        such as radium and thorium --- that is to say, the production of
        particles emitted at an immense speed, capable of rendering the
        air a conductor of electricity and of being deviated by a
        magnetic field. </p>
      <p>There exist other accessory characteristics: photographic
        impressions, production of phosphorescence and fluorescence,
        etc., by the emitted particles, but they are of secondary
        importance. Besides which, 99% of the emission of radium is
        composed of particles having no action on photographic plates,
        and there exist radioactive substances such as polonium which
        only emit rays such as these (1). </p>
      <p>[(1) Since this was written, successful attempts have been made
        by Prof. Huff to impress a photographic plate with the beta rays
        from polonium: <i>Proc. Roy. Soc</i>., 21 July 1906 ] </p>
      <p>The most important among the characteristics above enumerated
        is the emission of particles able to render the air a conductor
        of electricity and consequently capable of discharging an
        electroscope at a distance. It has been exclusively made use of
        in the separation of radium. It is therefore the one to which we
        shall principally have recourse. </p>
      <p>The possibility of deviating these particles by a magnetic
        field constitutes the next most characteristic phenomenon. It
        has permitted the identity of the particles emitted by
        substances endowed with radioactivity, whether spontaneous or
        excited, with the cathode rays of Crookes’ tubes to be
        indisputably established. It is the degree of deviation of these
        particles by a magnetic field which has enabled their speed to
        be measured. </p>
      <p><b>(2) Dissociation of Matter by Light ~</b> </p>
      <p>It was by attentively studying the action of light on metals
        and noting the analogy of the effluves emitted with the cathode
        rays that I was led to the discovery of the universality of the
        dissociation of matter. </p>
      <p>It will be seen in the experimental part of this work that the
        technique of the experiments demonstrating the dissociation of
        bodies under the influence of light is pretty simple, since it
        amounts to throwing onto a positively charged electroscope the
        effluves of dissociated matter emitted by a metallic plate
        struck by light. These effluves are not produced by metals
        alone, but by the majority of substances. In some, the emission,
        surface for surface, may be 40 times more considerable than that
        produced by certain spontaneously radioactive substances, such
        as thorium and uranium. </p>
      <p>For a long time the composition of these effluves which I
        asserted to be of the nature of cathode rays and of the
        radiations emitted by radioactive bodies was contested, but at
        the present day no physicist denies this identity. </p>
      <p>The effluves produced under the action of light, like the
        cathode rays, render the air a conductor of electricity, and
        they are also deviated by a magnet. The electric charge of these
        component particles, as measured by J.J. Thomson, has been found
        equal to that of the cathode particles. </p>
      <p>I shall show in the experimental part of this work that the
        different parts of the spectrum possess very different powers of
        dissociation, and that the resistance of various bodies to
        dissociation by light is very unequal. The ultraviolet is the
        most active region. In the extreme regions of the ultraviolet
        produced by electric sparks --- regions which do not exist in
        the solar spectrum because they are absorbed by the atmosphere
        --- it may be noted that all bodies dissociate with far greater
        rapidity than in ordinary light. In this part of the spectrum,
        substances which, like gold and steel, are not sensibly affected
        by solar light, emit effluves in quantities sufficiently
        abundant to discharge the electroscope almost instantaneously.
        If the earth were not protected from the extreme solar
        ultraviolet rays by its atmosphere, life on its surface, under
        existing circumstances, probably would be impossible. </p>
      <p>Solar light does not possess the property of dissociating the
        molecules of gases. These can only be dissociated by the
        absolutely extreme ultraviolet radiations. If, as is probable,
        these radiations exist in the solar spectrum, before their
        absorption by the atmospheric envelope, an energetic
        dissociation of the aerial gases must take place on the confines
        of our air. This cause must have contributed, in the course of
        ages, to deprive certain stars, like the moon, of their
        atmosphere. </p>
      <p><b>(3) Dissociation of Matter by Chemical Reactions ~</b> </p>
      <p>We now arrive at one of the most curious and unexpected parts
        of my researches. Convinced of the general character of the
        phenomena I had noted, I asked myself whether chemical reactions
        might not generate effluves similar to those produced from
        substances by light, and which would still possess the common
        characteristic of dissipating electric charges. Experiment has
        fully confirmed this hypothesis. </p>
      <p>Here was a fact hitherto absolutely unsuspected. It had long
        been known, since the observation goes back as far as Laplace
        and Lavoisier, that hydrogen prepared by the action of iron on
        sulfuric acid was electrified. This fact ought to have impressed
        physicists the more that the direct electrification of a gas is
        impossible. A gas left for an indefinite period in contact with
        a metallic plate charged with electricity never becomes
        electrified. If the air could be electrified it would no longer
        be an insulator, an electroscope could no longer keep its
        charge, and the majority of electrical phenomena would still be
        unknown to us. But this fact, so important, since it contained
        the proof, then concealed, that matter is not indestructible,
        remained totally unnoticed. </p>
      <p>The most striking phenomena hardly attract our attention except
        when light is thrown upon them by other phenomena, or when some
        great generalization capable of explaining them forces us to
        examine them more closely. If, in Lavoisier’s experiments just
        alluded to, hydrogen was found to be electrified, it was only
        because the atoms of this substance had undergone the
        commencement of dissociation. It is curious to note that the
        first experiment from which it could be deduced that matter is
        perishable had for its author the illustrious savant whose
        greatest claim to glory is that of endeavoring to prove that
        matter is indestructible. </p>
      <p>The experiments collected at the end of this work prove that a
        large number of chemical reactions, whether accompanied or
        unaccompanied by the disengagement of gas, produce effluves
        similar to the cathode rays, and therefore reveal a destruction
        of matter without return during the reactions. </p>
      <p>Among the reactions I shall only mention the decomposition of
        water by zinc and sulfuric acid or merely by sodium amalgam, the
        formation of acetylene by calcium carbide, the formation of
        oxygen by the decomposition of oxygenated water by means of
        manganese dioxide, and the hydration of quinine sulfate. </p>
      <p>As regards quinine sulfate, it presents highly curious
        phenomena. This body, as it has long been known, becomes
        phosphorescent by the action of heat, but what was not known is
        that after having lost its phosphorescence, if sufficiently
        heated it becomes highly luminous and radioactive on
        refrigeration. After seeking the cause of its phosphorescence on
        cooling, and proving it to be due to a very slight hydration, I
        noted that by reason of this hydration the substance became
        radioactive for a few minutes. It was the first instance I
        discovered of the dissociation of matter&nbsp; --- that is to
        say, of radioactivity --- by chemical reactions, and it led me
        to the discovery of many more. </p>
      <p>Since then, Dr Kalahne, Prof. of Physics at the University of
        Heidelberg, has taken up again the same subject in an important
        study. "My observations", he says, "absolutely confirm that the
        chemical phenomena pointed out by Gustave Le Bon is the cause of
        the radiation" (<i>Ann. Der Physik</i>, 1905, p. 450, 457). </p>
      <p>Rutherford also had my results relating to quinine sulfate
        verified by one of his pupils, who devoted a paper to the
        subject (1). </p>
      <p>[Ms. Gates: <i>Physical Review</i> xviii, 1904, p. 144). She
        came to the conclusion that while Dr Le Bon is right as to the
        cause of the radiations, they differ from those of the
        radioactive substances in several particulars.] </p>
      <p>The author has noted, as I did, that the air became a conductor
        of electricity, and that the phenomenon was duly produces, as I
        had said, by the hydration of quinine sulfate, but he thinks
        that the radioactivity is due to a chemical reaction to "to a
        kind of ultraviolet light" generated by the phosphorescence. </p>
      <p>That the radioactivity was due to chemical reaction is exactly
        what I wished to demonstrate, and this Prof. Kalahne has
        confirmed; that it was due to ultraviolet light is impossible
        This Ms. Gates has since admitted in <i>Physical Review</i>
        1906, p. 46), for the reason that the phosphorescence persists
        longer than the radioactivity, a thing which would not happen if
        the latter were the consequence of the light produced by the
        phosphorescence. </p>
      <p>Rutherford thinks that the radiations thus produced differ from
        those of the radioactive substances because, he says, they have
        little penetrating power. He is not unaware, however, that this
        penetration proves nothing, since, according to him, 99% of the
        emission of radium is stopped by a thin sheet of paper, and
        certain very radioactive substances, such as polonium, only emit
        radiations having no penetration (cf. Prof. Giesel, <i>Chem.
          Berichte</i> 1906, Bd. xxxix, p. 780). I think that in writing
        the above the eminent physicist was still under the influence of
        the idea, very widespread at the outset, that radioactivity was
        the exclusive appanage of a small number of exceptional bodies.
      </p>
      <p><b>(4) Dissociation of Matter by Electric Action ~</b> </p>
      <p>Certain very intense electric actions --- for instance,
        induction sparks 50 cm long between which is placed the body to
        be experimented on --- do exercise a slight action --- that is
        to say, render the bodies submitted to their influence slightly
        radioactive, but the effect is much weaker than that produced by
        a simple ray of light or by heat. </p>
      <p>This is not very astonishing. Electricity, as I shall show
        farther on, is a&nbsp; product of the dissociation of matter. It
        can certainly generate, like the cathode rays or radioactive
        emissions, secondary radiations in the substances struck by it,
        but the ions to which it gives birth in the air have too low a
        speed to produce much effect. </p>
      <p>No doubt it is known, from the experiments of Elster and
        Geitel, that a wire electrified to a high potential acquires a
        temporary radioactivity; but it may be supposed in that case
        that the wire, by reason of its electrification, only attracts
        the ions which are always present in the atmosphere. </p>
      <p>It was by pursuing the study of radioactivity excited by
        electricity that I was led to effect the experiment which will
        be mentioned later, and to compel particles of dissociated
        matter to traverse, visibly, and without deviation, thin plates
        of glass or ebonite. </p>
      <p><b>(5) Dissociation of Matter by Combustion ~</b> </p>
      <p>If slight chemical reactions, such as simple hydration, can
        provoke the dissociation of matter, it will be conceived that
        the phenomena of combustion, which constitute powerful chemical
        reactions, must realize the maximum of dissociation. This is, in
        fact, what is observed. A burning body is an intense source of
        cathode rays similar to those emitted y a radioactive body, but
        possessing, by reason of their low speed, no great penetration.
      </p>
      <p>For at least a century it has been known that the gases arising
        from flames discharge electrified bodies. Branly has shown that,
        even when cooled, gases preserve this property. All these facts
        remained uninterpreted, and it was hardly suspected that within
        them dwelt one of the proofs of the dissociation of matter. </p>
      <p>This was, however, a conclusion to which one was bound to come.
        It has been clearly confirmed by the recent researches of J.J.
        Thomson. He has shown that a simple metal wire or thread of
        carbon brought to a white heat --- the carbon thread of an
        incandescent lamp, for example --- is a powerful and almost
        unlimited source of electrons and ions --- that is to say, of
        particles identical with those of radioactive bodies. He has
        proved it by showing that the relation of their charge to their
        mass was the same. “We are therefore brought to this
        conclusion", he says, "that from an incandescent metal or a
        heated thread of carbon electrons are projected". Their quantity
        is enormous, he points out, for the quantity of electricity
        which these particles can neutralize corresponds to many amperes
        per square cm of surface. No radioactive body could produce
        electrons in such proportions. If it be considered that the
        solar spectrum indicates the presence of muych carbon in its
        photosphere, it follows that the sun must emit an enormous mass
        of electrons, which, on striking the upper layers of our
        atmosphere, perhaps produce the aurora borealis through their
        property of rendering rarified gases phosphorescent. This
        observation squares perfectly with my theory of the maintenance
        of the sun’s heat by the dissociation of the matter of which it
        is composed. </p>
      <p><b>(6) Dissociation of Matter by Heat ~</b> </p>
      <p>Heat much inferior to that produced by combustion --- that is
        to say, not exceeding 300° C. --- is sufficient to provoke the
        dissociation of matter. But in this case the phenomenon is
        rather complicated, and its explanation has required very
        lengthy researches. </p>
      <p>The reason is that, in reality, heat does not in this case
        appear to act directly as the agent of dissociation. I shall
        show in the chapter devoted to my experiments that it acts as if
        the metal contained a limited provision of a substance similar
        to the emanation of radioactive matter, which it gives out under
        the influence of heat, and then only recuperates by repose. It
        is for this reason that, after a metal has been rendered
        radioactive by a slight heat, it soon loses all trace of
        radioactivity, and regains it only after several days. It is,
        too, in this way that radioactive substances really behave, but
        in consequence of their activity being much superior to that of
        ordinary substances, whatever they lose from time to time is
        again formed simultaneously, unless they are brought to a red
        heat. In this last case the loss is only made up after a certain
        lapse of time. </p>
      <p>When I published these experiments, J.J. Thomson had not yet
        made known his researches which proved that nearly all
        substances contain an emanation comparable with that of
        radioactive bodies, such as radium and thorium. His observations
        fully confirm my own. </p>
      <p><b>(7) Spontaneous Dissociation of Matter ~</b> </p>
      <p>The experiments alluded to above prove that most substances
        contain a provision of radioactive matter which can be expelled
        by a slight heat and spontaneously formed anew; these substances
        are therefore, like ordinary radioactive substances, subject to
        spontaneous dissociation. It is, however, extremely slow. </p>
      <p>In the foregoing experiments this spontaneous dissociation has
        only been made evident by means of slight heat. It is possible,
        however, by the help of various artifices --- for instance, by
        folding the metal over itself so as to form a closed cylinder
        --- to allow radioactive products to form therein, the presence
        of which is verified by the electroscope. The substance thus
        experimented on, however, soon ceases to be radioactive. It has
        not on that account used up all its provision of radioactivity;
        it has simply lost all that it can emit at the temperature under
        which the operation is effected. But, as with phosphorescent
        substances or radioactive matter, it suffices to heat it a
        little for it to produce an increased quantity of active
        effluves. </p>
      <p>The researches I have just summarized prove that all substances
        in nature are radioactive, and that this radioactivity is in no
        way a property peculiar to a few bodies. All matter, then, tends
        spontaneously towards dissociation. This latter is most often
        very small, because it is hindered by the action of antagonistic
        forces. It is only exceptionally, and under different
        influences, such as light, combustion, chemical reaction, etc.,
        capable of striving against these forces, that dissociation
        reaches a certain intensity. </p>
      <p>Having proved by the experiments just summarized, of which the
        details will be found at the end of this volume, that the
        dissociation of matter is a general phenomenon, I am entitled to
        say that the doctrine of the invariability of the weight of
        atoms, on which all modern chemistry is based, is only an
        illusion resulting entirely from lack of sensitiveness in our
        balances. Were they sufficiently sensitive, all our chemical
        laws would be considered as merely approximation. With exact
        instruments we should note in many circumstances, and
        particularly in chemical reactions, that the atom loses a part
        of its weight. I may, then, be allowed to affirm that, contrary
        to the principle laid down as the basis of chemistry by
        Lavoisier, we do not recover in a chemical combination the total
        weight of the substances employed to bring about this
        combination. </p>
      <p><b>(8) The Part Taken by the Dissociation of Matter in Natural
          Phenomena ~</b> </p>
      <p>We have just seen that very different causes acting in a
        continuous manner, such as light, can dissociate matter and
        finally transform it into elements which no longer possess any
        material properties, and cannot again become matter. </p>
      <p>This dissociation, which has gone on since the beginning of the
        ages, must have played a great part in natural phenomena. It is
        probably the origin of atmospheric electricity, and no doubt
        that of the clouds, and consequently of the rainfall which
        exercises so great an influence on climate. One of the
        characteristic properties of radioactive emissions is that of
        condensing the vapor of water, a property which also belongs to
        all kinds of dust, and is demonstrated by an experiment of long
        standing (1). A globe full of water in ebullition is placed in
        communication with two other globes, one filled with ordinary
        air from a room, the other filled with the same air cleared of
        dust by simple filtration through cotton wool. It can then be
        seen that the stream coming into the globe containing the
        unfiltered air immediately condenses into a thick fog, while
        that in the globe containing pure air does not condense. </p>
      <p>[(1) See Mr John Aitken: <i>Trans. Roy. Soc. Edinburgh</i>,
        vol. xxx (1883), p. 337; cf. C. Wilson, <i>Philos. Trans.&nbsp;
        </i>cxii, p. 403] </p>
      <p>We see how the importance of the phenomenon of the dissociation
        of matter increases with the study of it. Its universality
        spreads daily, and the hour is not far distant, I believe, when
        it will be considered as the source of a great number of
        phenomena observed on the surface of our planet. </p>
      <p>But these are not the most important of the phenomena due to
        the dissociation of matter. We have already shown it to be the
        source of solar heat, and we shall see presently that it is the
        origin of electricity. </p>

        <p><b><font size="+1">Artificial Equilibria of the Elements
              Arising from the Dissociation of Matter</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>We shall see in a later chapter that the particles which escape
        from an electrified point connected with one of the poles of an
        electrical machine in motion are composed of ions and electrons
        of the same composition as the particles of dissociated matter
        emitted by the radioactive substances or by a Crookes’ tube.
        They, too, render the air a conductor of electricity, and are
        deviated by a magnetic field. If, therefore, we wish to study
        the equilibria of which the elements of dissociated matter are
        capable, we may replace a radioactive body by a point
        electrified by being connected with one of the poles of an
        electrical machine in action. </p>
      <p>These particles are subject to the laws of attraction and
        repulsions which govern all electric phenomena. By utilizing
        these laws we can obtain at will the most varied equilibria. </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="fig4.jpg" height="266" width="147"><br>
          <img src="fig5.jpg" height="171" width="241"><br>
          <img src="fig6-7.jpg" height="624" width="242"></p>
      </center>
      <p>Such equilibria can only be maintained for a moment. If we were
        able to isolate and fix them for good --- that is to say, so
        that they would survive their generating cause --- we should
        have succeeded in creating with immaterial particles something
        singularly resembling matter. The enormous quantity of energy
        condensed within the atom shows the impossibility of realizing
        such an experiment. </p>
      <p>But if we cannot with immaterial things effect equilibria able
        to survive the cause which gave them birth, we can at least
        maintain them for a sufficiently long time to photograph them,
        and thus create a kind of momentary materialization. </p>
      <p>By utilizing nothing but the laws mentioned above I have
        succeeded in grouping the particles of dissociated matter, so as
        to give this grouping every possible form --- straight and
        curved lines, prisms, cells, etc., which were then made
        permanent by photography. </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="fig8-11.jpg" height="601" width="497"></p>
      </center>
      <p>In Figures 8 to 11 we see straight and curved figures produced
        by the mutual repulsions of particles of dissociated matter
        having electrical charges of the same sign. So soon as the
        particles are brought near enough to each other, they repel one
        another and do not succeed in touching, as can be seen by the
        dark lines separating them and the considerable shortening of
        the radiation on the side where the particles are. By
        multiplying the discharges. By means of an arrangement of fine
        needles, the regular forms of Figures 12 to 15 are obtained. </p>

        <p><img src="fig12-15.jpg" height="663" width="517"></p>
      </center>
      The polygonal forms, represented in some of the photographs, are
      not, of course, reproductions of plane surfaces, but of forms
      really possessing three dimensions, of which photography can only
      give the projection. They are, therefore, really figures in space
      which I have obtained, by maintaining for a moment in the
      equilibrium forced upon them, particles of dissociated matter.
      <p>The particles which form the model of the images here produced,
        are not composed entirely of electrons. According to current
        ideas, they should be regarded as electric atoms surrounded by a
        retinue of material particles. They are therefore composed of
        those ions which we studied in a former chapter. But the nucleus
        of these latter is constituted of those electric atoms which are
        produced by the dematerialization of matter. </p>
      <p>Among the forms of different equilibrium that we can cause
        particles of dissociated matter to assume, there is one --- the
        globular form --- of which the theory has not yet been
        established, attraction and repulsion not sufficing for its
        explanation. It is probable that the electric atoms must here be
        in a special state of whirling equilibrium. This equilibrium,
        though still momentary, is much more stable than those in the
        preceding experiments. </p>
      <p>Electricity in this form has more than once been observed
        during storms, but rarely enough for its existence to have long
        been denied. In such cases, it occurs in the form of brilliant
        globes which may attain the size of a child’s head. They revolve
        slowly, and finally burst with a noise like a shell, causing
        great damage. The energy enclosed in them is therefore
        considerable, and I willingly appeal to this example for the
        comprehension of what may be done with condensed energy in a
        state of equilibrium of at least momentary stability. </p>
      <p>We cannot hope to generate in our laboratories phenomena of
        such intensity, but we can reproduce them on a small scale.
        Small luminous spheres imitating globular thunderbolts can be
        produced by various methods. That of M. Stephane Leduc permits
        them to be very easily formed. It suffices to place on a
        photographic plate, at a few centimeters from each other, two
        very thin rods connected with the different poles of a static
        machine. There soon issues from the rod connected with the
        negative pole small luminous spheres, apparently about one mm in
        diameter, which very slowly make for the other rod, and vanish
        as soon as they touch it. </p>
      <p>But, with this mode of operation, one may always suppose a
        particular form of effluve to exist between the two poles. I
        have therefore tried to obtain this globular electricity with a
        single pole., and I have succeeded in doing so by a very simple
        process. A rod, about half a cm in diameter, terminated by a
        needle of which the point is placed on a plate covered with
        silver bromide-gelatin, is connected with the negative pole of a
        Wimhurst machine, and the other pole is earthed. When the
        machine is set in motion, one sees issue from the point of the
        needle one or several luminous globes, which advance slowly and
        disappear abruptly after a few centimeters, leaving on the plate
        the trace of their trajectory. </p>
      <p>If, instead of employing a thick rod terminated by a needle, a
        thin rod were used, the formation of luminous spheres would not
        take place. The phenomenon seems to act --- though probably it
        is produced quite otherwise --- as if the electricity of the
        thick rod accumulated at the point of the needle after the
        fashion of a drop of liquid [<i>See: Kenneth Shoulders’ Elektrum
          Validum</i>]. </p>
      <p>It is difficult to state precisely the part taken in these
        experiments by the gelatino-bromide of the photographic plate.
        Its presence facilitates the result, but is it indispensable?
        Some authors claim to have obtained globular electricity with
        simple plates of glass or mica, but I have not succeeded in
        producing them. </p>
      <p>Howeve that may be, the luminous spheres formed by one of the
        processes just indicated, possess very singular properties,
        notably a considerable stability. They can be touched and
        displaced with a strip of metal without being discharged. A
        magnetic field --- at all events the one of rather weak
        intensity at my disposal --- has no action on them. If these
        spheres only consist of agglomerated ions, these last must be in
        a very special state. Their stability can only proceed from
        extremely rapid whirling movements, similar to those of the
        gyroscope which, as is well-known, simply owes its equilibrium
        to the rotary motion which animates it. </p>
      <p>In the preceding experiments we have realized, with particles
        of dissociated matter, geometrical figures of a momentary
        stability which hardly survive the causes forming them. But it
        is possible to maintain for a fairly long time and on one
        surface certain forms of the electric fluid and to cause it to
        take the form of geometric plane figures with concise outlines.
      </p>
      <p>In speaking of the properties of ionized gases, I have called
        by the name of ionic fluid, the fluid which the ionized
        particles make up by their aggregation. Thanks to its inertia,
        it is easy, by following the method pointed out by Prof. de
        Heen, to transform this into regular geometric figures
        possessing a certain permanence. The experiment is very simple.
        Take a large square plate of resin from 30 to 40 cm diameter and
        electrify it by passing its surface over one of the poles of an
        electrical machine in motion. Then expose the electrified face
        of this plate to two sources of ionization for several seconds
        --- for instance, two Bunsen burners at a distance of 5 to 6 cm
        from each other. The ions starting from these sources come into
        contact with the plate, repel the electricity, and then, when
        face to face with each other, they halt and form a straight line
        (Figure 16), This invisible line is rendered visible by dusting
        powdered sulfur on the plate by means of a sieve. After slightly
        shaking the plate, there will only remain on its surface the
        straight line traced by the ionic fluid. </p>
      <p>If, instead of two Bunsen burners, a certain number a re placed
        so as to form the outlines of geometrical figures, you obtain on
        the plate varied images: triangles, hexagons, etc., as regularly
        as if they had been traced with a ruler (Figures 17 to 19). It
        is evident that with an ordinary gas, you could produce nothing
        like this, since it would escape from the plate by diffusing
        through the atmosphere. </p>
      <p>In the different experiments above mentioned, we have
        materialized, crystallized as it were, for an instant the fluid,
        so immaterial in appearance, composed of the union of the
        elements proceeding from the dissociation of matter. We now
        begin to see how, with more complicated equilibria and above all
        with the colossal forces she has at her command, Nature has been
        able to create those stable elements which constitute material
        atoms. While in evolution towards the state of matter, the ether
        must, no doubt, have passed through intermediate phases of
        equilibrium similar to those indicated in this chapter, and also
        through various forms the history of which is unknown to us. </p>

        <p><b><font size="+1">How, Notwithstanding Its Stability, Matter
              Can Dissociate</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p><b>(1) Causes Capable of Modifying Molecular and Atomic
          Structures ~</b> </p>
      <p>The first objection which occurs to the mind of the chemist to
        whom one sets forth the theory of the dissociation of matter, is
        the following: How can bodies so stable as atoms --- which
        appear to withstand the most violent reactions, since their
        weight is always recognized as invariable --- dissociate either
        spontaneously or under such slight causes as rays of light
        hardly capable of influencing a thermometer? </p>
      <p>To say, as I maintain, that matter is a large reservoir of
        forces, simply means that there is no need to look outside it
        for the origin of the energy expended during dissociation, but
        this in no way explains how intra-atomic energy condensed under
        an evidently very stable form can free itself from the bonds
        which hold it. The doctrine of intra-atomic energy therefore
        supplies no solution to the question just put. It is unable to
        say why the atom, which is to all appearance the most stable of
        all things in the universe, can, under certain conditions, lose
        its stability to the extent of easily disaggregating </p>
      <p>If we wish to discover the solution of this problem, it will
        first be necessary to show, by various examples, that in order
        to produce in matter very great changes of equilibrium, it is
        not always the magnitude of the effort which counts, but rather
        the quality of that effort. Every equilibrium in Nature is only
        sensitive to the appropriate excitant, and it is this excitant
        which must be discovered in order to obtain the effect sought.
        Once discovered, it can be seen that very slight causes can
        easily modify the equilibrium of atoms and bring about, like a
        spark in a mass of gunpowder, effects whose intensity greatly
        exceeds that of the exciting cause. </p>
      <p>A well-known acoustic analogy allows this difference between
        the intensity and the quality of the effort to be clearly shown
        from the point of view of the effects produced. The most violent
        thunderclap or the most deafening explosion may be powerless to
        cause the vibration of a tuning fork, while a sound, very slight
        but of suitable period, will suffice to set it in motion. When a
        tuning fork starts vibrating by reason of the production near it
        of a sound identical with its own, it is said to vibrate by
        resonance. The part played by resonance in acoustics as well as
        in optics is now well known; it gives the best explanation of
        the phenomena of opacity and transparency. It can help to
        explain, with all sthe facts I am about to state, that
        insignificant causes can cause great transformations in matter.
      </p>
      <p>Although our means of observing the internal vibrations of
        bodies are very insufficient, facts, already numerous, prove
        that it is easy to profoundly change molecular and atomic
        equilibria, when they are acted upon by the proper agents. I
        shall confine myself to recalling a few of them. </p>
      <p>A simple ray of light, though its energy is very slight, by
        falling on the surface of substances, such as selenium, silver
        sulfide, copper oxide, platinum black, etc., modifies their
        electrical resistance to a considerable extent. So, too, several
        dielectrics become birefringent when electrified. Boracite,
        again, which is birefringent at ordinary temperatures, becomes
        unirefringent when heated. Certain alloys of iron and nickel
        also become instantaneously magnetic by heat and lose their
        magnetism on cooling. Finally. If a transparent body placed in a
        magnetic body has a luminous ray passed through it, the rotation
        of the plane of polarization can be observed. </p>
      <p>All these changes in physical properties necessarily imply
        changes of molecular equilibria. Slight causes suffice to bring
        about these changes because the molecular equilibria are
        sensitive to these causes. Forces far greater, but not
        appropriate, would, on the contrary, have no effect. Take any
        salt --- potassium chloride, for instance. It can be ground,
        pulverized by the most powerful machinery without it ever being
        possible to separate the molecules of which it is composed. And
        yet, to dissociate these molecules (chlorine and potassium) it
        suffices to dissolve the substance in a liquid so that the
        solution is sufficiently diluted, according to modern theories
        on electrolysis. </p>
      <p>Many similar examples can be given. To force apart the
        molecules of a steel bar it would have to be submitted to
        enormous mechanical strains; yet it suffices to heat it
        slightly, if only by placing the hand upon it, for it to
        elongate. This elongation of a bar by the contact of the hand
        can even be made visible, as Tyndall showed, to a whole audience
        by means of a lever and a mirror suitably arranged. A similar
        phenomenon is observed in water. It is almost incompressible
        under the very strongest pressure, and yet its temperature has
        only to be slightly lowered for it to contract. </p>
      <p>We can produce in a metal far more through molecular
        displacements than those effected by heat, for there are some
        which imply a concrete change in the direction of the direction
        of the molecules. No mechanical force could cause such
        transformations; yet they are instantaneously effected by
        bringing a bar of iron near a magnet, when all its molecules
        instantaneously change their direction. </p>
      <p>The recent employment of high temperatures, formerly impossible
        of attainment, as well as the introduction of the high
        electrical potentials which have permitted new chemical
        combinations to be produced, naturally leads us to think that it
        would be especially by means of these enormous forces that
        certain transformations will be possible. No doubt, by these new
        means, it has been possible to create certain chemical
        equilibria hitherto unknown, but to modify instable matter there
        is no need of these gigantic efforts. His is proved when we see
        certain luminous rays of a fixed wavelength producing
        instantaneously in various substances the chemical reactions
        which generate phosphorescence, and radiations of shorter
        wavelength giving birth to converse reactions which no less
        instantaneously destroy this phosphorescence. A further proof is
        afforded when we note that the Hertzian waves produced by
        electric sparks transform at a distance of 500 kilometers, the
        molecular structure of metal filings [in the coherer]; or again,
        when we observe that the neighborhood of a simple magnet
        immediately changes the direction of all the molecules of an
        iron bar in spite of all intervening obstacles. </p>
      <p>In the dissociation of matter similar facts are observed.
        Metals that are highly radioactive under the influence of
        luminous radiations are hardly so under the radiations of one
        but slightly different. The same thing seems to occur here as in
        the phenomenon of resonance. It is possible, as I remarked
        above, to cause a tuning fork or even a heavy bell to vibrate by
        producing close to them a note of a certain vibratory period,
        when the most violent noises may leave them insensitive. When we
        become better acquainted with the causes capable of slightly
        dissociating the aggregate of energy condensed in the atom, we
        shall certainly arrive at a more complete dissociation and be
        able to utilize it for industrial purposes. </p>
      <p>The whole of the preceding facts justifies my assertion that,
        in order to obtain important transformations of molecular
        equilibrium, it is not a question of the intensity but of the
        quality of the effort. These considerations enable it to be
        understood how structures so stable as atoms can be dissociated
        under the influence of such slight causes as a ray of light. If
        invisible ultraviolet radiations can dissociate the atoms of a
        steel block on which all the forces of mechanics would have no
        effect, it is because they form a stimulant to which matter is
        sensitive. The component parts of the retina are not sensitive
        to this stimulant, and this is why the ultraviolet light,
        capable of dissociating steel, has no action on the eye [except
        to blind it], which does not perceive its presence. </p>
      <p>Matter, insensitive to actions of importance, can therefore be,
        I repeat, sensitive to very minute ones. Under the appropriate
        influences, a very stable body may become unstable. We shall see
        soon that sometimes imponderable traces of substances may at
        times powerfully modify the equilibria of other bodies and act
        in consequence as those excitants, light but appropriate, which
        matter obeys. </p>
      <p><b>(2) Mechanism of the Dissociation of Matter ~</b> </p>
      <p>According to the ideas now current on the constitution of
        atoms, every atom may be considered as a small solar system
        comprising a central part round which turn with immense speed at
        least a thousand particles, and sometimes many more. These
        particles therefore possess a great kinetic energy. Let some
        appropriate cause come to disturb their trajectory or let their
        speed of rotation become sufficient for the centrifugal force
        which results from it to exceed the force of attraction that
        keeps them in their orbits, and the particles of the periphery
        will escape into space by following the tangent of the curve
        they formerly trod. By the emission they will give birth to the
        phenomena of radioactivity. Such, in any case, is one of the
        hypotheses which may be provisionally formulated. </p>
      <p>When it was recognized that radioactivity was an exceptional
        property appertaining to only a very few bodies, such as uranium
        and radium, it was thought --- and many physicists still think
        --- that the instability of these bodies was a consequence of
        the magnitude of their atomic weight. This explanation vanishes
        before the fact shown by my researches that it is just those
        metals whose atomic weight is feeblest, such as magnesium and
        aluminum, which become most easily radioactive under the
        influence of light; while, on the contrary, it is bodies
        possessing a high atomic weight, like gold, platinum, and lead,
        which have weakest radioactivity. Radioactivity is therefore
        independent of atomic weight, and probably very often due, as I
        shall explain later on, to certain chemical reactions of an
        unknown nature. Two bodies not radioactive sometimes become so
        when combined. Mercury and tin may be placed among bodies of
        which the dissociation, under the action of light, is the
        weakest; I have shown, however, that mercury became
        extraordinarily radioactive under this same influence, so soon
        as traces of tin are added to it. </p>
      <p>All the interpretations which precede contain assuredly only
        the outliners of an explanation. The mechanisms of the
        dissociation of matter is unknown to us. But what physical
        phenomenon is there whose ultimate causes are not equally hidden
        from our view? </p>
      <p><b>(3) Causes Capable of Producing the Dissociation of Very
          Radioactive Substances ~</b> </p>
      <p>We have seen that various causes may produce the dissociation
        of ordinary matter. But in the dissociation of substances
        spontaneously very radioactive --- radium and thorium, for
        instance --- no internal cause seems to bring about the
        phenomenon. How, then, can it be explained? </p>
      <p>Contrary to the opinions expressed at the commencement of
        researches into radioactivity, I have always maintained that the
        phenomena observed in radium arose from certain chemical
        reactions, similar to those produced in the case of
        phosphorescence. These reactions take place between substances
        of which one is in infinitesimal proportion to the other. I only
        published these considerations after I discovered bodies
        becoming radioactive in such conditions. Salts of quinine, for
        instance, are not radioactive. By letting them be slightly
        hydrated after desiccation, they become so, and remain
        phosphorescent while hydration lasts. Mercury and tin show no
        perceptible signs of radioactivity under the influence of light;
        but as to the former a trace of the latter, and its
        radioactivity at once becomes intense. These experiments even
        led me thereafter to modify entirely the properties of certain
        simple bodies by the addition of minute quantities of foreign
        bodies. </p>
      <p>The disintegration of matter necessarily implies a change of
        equilibrium in the disposition of the elements which compose the
        atom. It is only by passing into other forms of equilibrium that
        it can lose part of its energy, and, in consequence, can radiate
        anything. </p>
      <p>The changes of which it is then the seat differ from those
        known to chemistry, while the usual reactions affecting merely
        the structure of the groupings of atoms are extra-atomic.
        Ordinary chemistry can only vary the disposition of the stones
        destined to the building of an edifice. In the dissociation of
        atoms, the very materials with which the edifice is constructed
        are transformed. </p>
      <p>The mechanism of this atomic disaggregation is unknown, but it
        is quite evident that it allows of conditions of a peculiar
        order, very different from those hitherto studied by chemistry.
        The quantities of matter put in play are infinitely small and
        the energies liberated extraordinarily large, which is the
        opposite of that which we get in our ordinary reactions. </p>
      <p>Another characteristic of the intra-atomic reactions which
        produce radioactivity is that they seem to occur, as I said
        before, between bodies of which one is extremely small in
        quantity with regard to the other. These particular reactions,
        to which we will revert in another chapter, are mainly observed
        during phosphorescence. Pure bodies such as calcium sulfide,
        strontium sulfide, etc., are never phosphorescent. They only
        become so on being mixed with very small quantities of other
        bodies; and they then form mobile combinations, capable of being
        destroyed and regenerated with the greatest ease, which are
        accompanied by phosphorescence or the disappearance of
        phosphorescence. Other clearly defined reactions, such as a
        slight hydration, can likewise produce at the same time both
        phosphorescence and radioactivity. </p>
      <p>This conception that radioactivity had its origin in a special
        chemical process, has at least secured the favor of several
        physicists. It has, notably, been adopted and defended by
        Rutherford and Soddy. </p>
      <p>"Radioactivity", say these, "is accompanied by a succession of
        chemical changes in which new types of radioactive matter are
        being continuously produced. It is a process of equilibrium when
        the amount of new radioactivity is balanced by the loss of the
        radioactivity already produced. Radioactivity is maintained by
        the continual production of new quantities of matter possessing
        temporary radioactivity" (Philos. Mag., Sept. 1902). </p>
      <p>A radioactive body is, in fact, a body in course of
        transformation. Radioactivity is the expression of its
        never-ceasing leakage. Its change is necessarily an atomic
        disintegration. Atoms which have lost anything are, from that
        very fact, new atoms. </p>
      <p>One might consider as singular --- at all events, as little in
        accord with the observations in our laboratories --- the
        existence of chemical reactions continuing almost indefinitely.
        But we also find in phosphorescence reactions capable of taking
        effect with extreme slowness. I have shown by my experiments on
        invisible luminescence that phosphorescent bodies are capable of
        retaining in the dark, and for two years after exposure to
        sunlight, the property of radiating, in a continuous manner, an
        invisible light capable of impressing photographic plates. Since
        chemical reactions can destroy phosphorescence, and continue to
        act for two years, it will be understood that other reactions,
        such as those capable of producing radioactivity, might last for
        very much longer. </p>
      <p>Though the amount of energy radiated by atoms during their
        disaggregation is very large, the loss of material substance
        which occurs is extremely slight, by reason of the enormous
        condensation of energy contained in the atom. M. Becquerel
        estimates the duration of one gram of radium at a billion years.
        M. Curie contents himself with a million years. More modest
        still, Mr. Rutherford speaks only of a thousand years, and Sir
        William Crookes of a hundred years, for the dissociation of a
        gram of radium. These figures, of which the first are quite
        fantastic, become more and more reduced as the experiments
        become more exact. Dr Heydweiler (<i>Physikalische Zeitscr.</i>,
        15 Oct. 1903), after direct weighings, estimates the loss in 5
        grams of radium at 0.02 mg in 24 hours. If the loss continued at
        the same rate, then 5 grams of radium would lose one gram of
        their weight in 137 years. We are already astonishingly far from
        the billion years imagined by M. Becquerel. Even Heydweiler’s
        figures, from certain of my experiments, are still too high. He
        has put in a tube the body experimented on in bulk, while I have
        noted that the radioactivity of a same body increases
        considerably if the substance is spread over a large surface,
        which can be obtained by leaving to dry the paper used to filter
        a solution ofit. We thus reach the conclusion that 5 grams of
        radium lose probably the fifth of their weight in 20 years and
        consequently that a gram would last 100 years, which are exactly
        the figures given by Sir William Crookes. In reality it is only
        repeated experiments which will finally settle this point. </p>
      <p>But even if we accepted the figures of a thousand years given
        by Mr Rutherford for the duration of the existence of one gram
        of radium, it would be sufficient to prove that if spontaneously
        radioactive bodies, such as radium, existed in the geological
        epochs, they would have vanished long since, and would
        consequently no longer exist. And this again goes to support my
        theory, according to which rapid and spontaneous radioactivity
        only made its appearance since the bodies in question have been
        engaged in certain peculiar chemical combinations capable of
        affecting the stability of their atoms, which combinations we
        may perhaps some day succeed in reproducing. </p>
      <p><b>(4) Can the Existence of Radium be Affirmed With Certainty?</b>
      </p>
      <p>If radioactivity be the consequence of certain chemical
        reactions, it would appear that an absolutely pure body cannot
        be radioactive. It was on this reasoning, supported by various
        experiments, that I based by assertion a few years ago that the
        existence of the metal radium was very problematic. In fact,
        although the operation of separating a metal from its
        combinations is very easy, it has never been possible to
        separate radium. </p>
      <p>What one obtains at the present day under the name of radium is
        in nowise a metal, but a bromide or a chloride of this supposed
        metal. I consider it very probable that if radium exists and it
        is ever successfully isolated, it will have lost all the
        properties which render its combinations so interesting. But for
        a long time and for divers reasons I have predicted that radium
        will never be isolated, and, as the supposed process of
        isolation would be too simple not to have been tried by the
        possessors of sufficiently large quantities of radium, the
        complete silence observed upon these attempts is a strong
        presumption in favor of my hypothesis. The separation of barium
        from its salts is soeasy that this was one of the first metals
        isolated by Davy. </p>
      <p>The preparation of the salts of radium enables us to guess the
        manner in which were possibly formed the unknown combinations
        which have given birth to radioactivity. One knows how salts of
        radium were discovered. M. Curie having noticed that certain
        uranium ores acted on the electroscope with more force than
        uranium itself, was naturally induced to endeavor to isolate the
        substance to which this special activity was due. The property
        registered by the electroscope of rendering air more or less a
        conductor of electricity being the only available means of
        investigation, it was the action on the electroscope which alone
        served as guide in these researches. It was through it alone, in
        fact, that one could ascertain in which part of the precipitates
        the most active substances were to be found. After dissolving
        the ore in various solvents and precipitating the products
        contained in these solvents by fitting reagents, the most active
        parts were, by means of the electroscope, set aside, redissolved
        and separated anew by precipitation, and these manipulations
        were repeated a great number of times. The operation terminated
        with fractional crystallization, and finally a small quantity of
        a very active salt was obtained. It is to the metal, not
        isolated yet, of the salt thus obtained that the name of radium
        was given. </p>
      <p>The chemical properties of salts of radium are identical with
        those of the combinations of barium. Radioactivity apart, they
        only differ by certain rays in their spectra. The supposed
        atomic weight of radium, calculated from a very small quantity
        of its slats, varies so much with the different observers that
        nothing can be deduced from its as to the existence of this
        metal. </p>
      <p>Without being able to pronounce positively, I repeat that I
        believe the existence of radium to be very disputable. It is, at
        any rate, certain that it has not been possible to isolate it. I
        should much more willingly admit the existence of an unknown
        compound of barium capable of giving this metal radioactive
        properties. Radioactive radium chloride seems to bear the same
        relation to inactive barium chloride that barium sulfide, impure
        but phosphorescent, bears to barium sulfide pure, and for that
        reason, non-phosphorescent. It suffices, as I have noted above,
        for traces of foreign bodies to be added to certain sulfides ---
        those of calcium, barium, strontium, etc. --- for them to
        acquire the marvelous property of becoming phosphorescent under
        the action of light. This phosphorescence which may be produced
        by radiation acting for no more than one-tenth of a second and
        destroyed, as I have shown, by other radiations of equally short
        period, proves the existence of chemical combinations of extreme
        mobility. Phosphorescence is a phenomenon which hardly
        astonishes us because it has so long been known; but on
        reflection, it must be acknowledged that it is quite as singular
        as radioactivity and still less explicable. </p>
      <p>I will add that by operating with salts of radium but slightly
        active --- that is to say, still mingled with foreign bodies ---
        the role of the chemical reactions is very clearly apparent.
        Thus, for instance, the phosphorescence of these salts is lost
        by the action of heat and reappears after the lapse of a few
        days. Humidity destroys it altogether. </p>
      <p>Whether, then, we take ordinary phosphorescence or radioactive
        properties, they both seem to be produced by chemical reactions
        the nature of which is totally unknown to us, but in which it
        seems one of the combining bodies is always in very small
        quantity compared to the other. </p>
      <p>Doubtless, the law of definite proportions tells us that
        substances can only combine in certain relative quantities. This
        merely proves that bodies only form stable equilibria --- which
        are the only ones accessible to chemistry --- when combined in
        certain proportions. The number of combinations that two or more
        bodies can form is perhaps infinite, but as they are not stable,
        we can only suspect their existence when they are unaccompanied
        by marked physical phenomena. The combinations accompanied by
        radioactivity or phosphorescence are most probably instable
        combinations of this nature. </p>
      <p>However this may be, the above theory greatly assisted me in my
        researches. It is owing to this theory that I was led to
        discover the radioactivity which accompanies certain chemical
        reactions, and to find combinations capable of enormously
        increasing the dissociation of a body under the influence of
        light, and, finally, to fundamentally modify the properties of
        certain simple substances. </p>

        <p><b><font size="+1">Properties of the Substances Intermediate
              Between Matter and the Ether</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>All the substances we have studied in the shape of products of
        the dissociation of matter have presented characteristics
        visibly intermediate between those of matter and those of the
        ether. Sometimes they possess material qualities, as the
        emanations from thorium and radium, which can be condensed like
        a gas and enclosed in a tube. They equally present certain of
        the qualities if immaterial things, like the last-named
        emanation which, in certain phases of its evolution, vanished by
        transforming itself into electric particles. Here, then, is a
        complete transformation of a material body into an immaterial
        substance. But it is possible to go on further. </p>
      <p>What are the characteristics which allow us to assert that a
        substance is no longer altogether matter without yet being
        either, and that it constitutes something intermediate between
        these two substances. </p>
      <p>It is only if we see matter lose one of its irreducible
        characteristics --- that is to say, one of those of which it
        cannot be deprived by any other means whatever --- that we are
        authorized to say that it has lost its quality of matter. </p>
      <p>We have already seen that these irreducible characteristics are
        not numerous, since up to the present only one has been
        discovered. All the usual properties of matter --- solidity,
        form, color, etc. --- are indestructible. A mass of rock can, by
        heat, be transformed into vapor. One property alone, the mass
        measured by the weight, becomes invariable through all the
        transformations of bodies and allows them to be followed and
        rediscovered, notwithstanding the frequency of their changes. It
        is on this invariability of the mass that the sciences of
        chemistry and mechanics have been built. </p>
      <p>Mass, as is well known, is simply the measure of inertia ---
        that is to say, of that property of unknown essence which
        enables matter to resist motion or the changes of motion. Its
        magnitude, which can be represented by a weight, is an
        absolutely invariable quantity for any given body, whatever be
        the conditions in which it can be placed. We are therefore led
        to consider a substance of which the inertia, and consequently
        the mass, can by any means be rendered variable as something
        very different from matter. </p>
      <p>Now, it is just this variability of the mass --- that is to
        say, of the inertia --- which is noted in the electric particles
        emitted by radioactive bodies during their disaggregation. The
        variability of this fundamental property will allow us to state
        that the elements resulting from the dissociation of bodies,
        elements which besides differ so by their general properties
        from material substances, form a substance intermediate between
        matter and the ether. </p>
      <p>Long before the current theories as to the structure of the
        electric field, now supposed to be formed by the conjunction of
        particular atoms, it was noticed that it possessed inertia ---
        that is to say, resistance to motion or to change of motion, but
        only quite lately has the measurement of this inertia been
        arrived at. The oscillating discharge of a Leyden jar was one of
        the first phenomena which revealed the inertia of the electric
        fluid. This oscillating discharge can be compared to the
        movements, similarly die to its inertia, which a liquid poured
        into a U-tube makes before reaching its position of equilibrium.
        It is likewise through inertia that the phenomena of
        self-induction are produced. </p>
      <p>So long as the inertia of electric particles could not be
        measured, it was allowable to suppose it to be identical with
        that of matter; as soon as it was possible to calculate their
        velocity from the intensity of the magnetic force necessary to
        deviate them from their trajectory, it became possible to
        measure their mass. It was then seen to vary with their speed. </p>
      <p>The first experiments on this point are due to Kaufmann and
        Abraham. By observing on a photographic plate the deviation
        under the influence of two superposed magnetic and electric
        fields, they noted that the relation of the electric charge e,
        carried by a radioactive particle, to the mass m of this
        particle, varied with its velocity. As it cannot be supposed
        that in this relation the charge changes, it is evident that it
        is the mass which varies. </p>
      <p>The variation of the mass of the particles with their speed is
        besides in agreement with the electromagnetic theory of light,
        and had already been pointed out by various authors, Larmor
        amongst them. The variation of the mass would suffice to prove
        that substances which exhibit such a property are no longer
        matter. It is thus that Kaufmann deduces from his observations
        that the electron, of which certain radioactive emissions are
        composed, "is nothing but an electric charge distributed over a
        volume or a surface of very small dimensions". </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="fig20.jpg" height="469" width="491"></p>
      </center>
      <p>By putting Abraham’s equation into the form of a curve, it is
        easy to see the manner in which the mass of the elements of
        dissociated matter vary with their speed. Constant at first even
        for very great velocities, it increases abruptly and quickly
        tends to become infinite as it approaches the velocity of light.
      </p>
      <p>So long as the mass has not attained a speed equal to 20% of
        that of light --- that is to say, not exceeding 50,000 km/sec,
        its magnitude, represented by 1 at the beginning, remains about
        the same (1.012). When the speed reaches half that of light
        (150,000 km/sec) the mass has still only increased by one-tenth.
        When the speed equals three-fourths that of light, the increase
        of mass is still very slight (1.369). When the speed equals
        nine-tenths that of light, the mass has not quite doubled
        (1.82); but as soon as the speed reaches 0.999 that of light,
        the mass increases sixfold (6.678). </p>
      <p>We are here very close to the speed of light, and the mass has
        as yet only increased sixfold; but it is now that the figures
        deduced from the equation begin to increase singularly. For the
        mass of the electric atom to become 20 times greater (20,49),
        its speed will only have to differ from that of light by the
        fraction of a millimeter. For its mass to become 100 times
        greater, its velocity would have to differ from that of light by
        the fraction of a millimeter comprising 58 figures. Finally, if
        the speed of the electric atom became exactly equal to that of
        light, its mass would be theoretically infinite. </p>
      <p>These last results cannot be verified by any experiment, and
        are evidently only an extrapolation. We must not, however,
        consider as a priori absurd the existence of a substance of
        which the mass would increase in immense proportions, while its
        already very great speed would only vary by the minute fraction
        of a millimeter. The considerable increase of an effect under
        the influence of a very small variation in the cause is observed
        in many physical laws which can be translated by asymptotic
        curves. The immense variations in size of the image of an object
        for a very slight displacement of that object when very close to
        the principal focus of a lens, furnish an example of this.
        Suppose an object placed at one-tenth of a millimeter from the
        focus of a lens with a focus of 10 cm. The general question of
        lenses shows that its image will be magnified a thousand times.
        If the object is brought nearer by one-hundredth of a
        millimeter, its image will, theoretically, be magnified a
        hundred thousand times, If, lastly, the object is placed in the
        very focus itself, the image will, theoretically, be infinite.
        Every time a physical law can be translated by curves to the
        above, the slightest variation in the variable produces
        extremely important variations of the function in the
        neighborhood of the limit (1). </p>
      <p>[(1) I must point out, by the way --- and this observation will
        explain many historical events --- that it is not only physical,
        but many social phenomena which can be likewise defined by
        curves possessing the properties we have just stated, and in
        which, consequently, very small changes in a cause may produce
        very great effects. This is owing to the fact that when a cause
        acts for a length of time in a same direction, its effects
        increase in geometrical progression, which the cause varies
        simply in arithmetical progression. Causes are the logarithms of
        effects.] </p>
      <p>Leaving these theoretical considerations and coming back to the
        results of experiments, we may say this: the particles produced
        during the dissociation of matter possess a property resembling
        inertia, and in this they are akin to matter; but this inertia,
        instead of being constant in magnitude, varies with the speed,
        and on this point particles of dissociated matter are sharply
        differentiated from material atoms. </p>
      <p>The study of the properties of inertia of these elements leads,
        as will be seen, to their being considered something which,
        issuing from matter, possesses properties somewhat similar to,
        but yet notably different from, those of material atoms.
        Representing one of the phases of the dematerialization of
        matter, they are only able to retain a part of the properties of
        this last. We shall see in another chapter that the electric
        field likewise possesses properties intermediate between those
        of matter and those of ether. </p>
      <p>Some physicists have supposed --- without, however, being able
        to furnish any proofs --- that the inertia of matter is die to
        the electric particles of which it should be composed, and
        consequently that all the inertia of material substances is
        entirely of electromagnetic origin. There is nothing to indicate
        that material inertia can be identified with that of the
        particles of dissociated matter. The mass of these last is only,
        in reality, an apparent mass resulting simply from its condition
        as an electrified body in motion. They appear, besides, to have
        a longitudinal mass (that which measures the opposition to
        acceleration in the direction of the motion), different from the
        transversal mass (that perpendicular to the direction of the
        motion). In every way it is evident that the properties of an
        element of dissociated matter differ considerably from those of
        a material atom (1). </p>
      <p>[(1) The vicious circle of the argument attacked in this
        paragraph is thus well set forth by Prof. H.A. Wilson: "It is
        now suggested that all matter is composed of electrons, so that
        all inertia is electromagnetic. Density, according to this view,
        is simply the number of electrons per unit volume.
        Electromagnetic inertia --- that is, all inertia --- is due to
        the energy of the magnetic field produced by the moving charges
        of electricity. The energy of this magnetic field resides in the
        ether. Accordiing to Maxwell’s dynamical theory, the
        electromagnetic energy of the ether is due to motion of parts of
        the ether, these parts possessing motion. But the only kind of
        inertia which we really know is the inertia of matter, which is
        due to the electromagnetic action of the electrons of which
        matter is made up. If inertia is due to electrons, then if we
        ascribe to parts of the ether the property of inertia, we ought
        to say that the ether contains so many electrons per unit
        volume. But the free ether is not supposed to contain any
        electrons; in fact, if we explain inertia by the energy of the
        magnetic fields produced by moving charges, then evidently to
        explain this energy by inertia in the ether is merely to argue
        in a circle" (<i>Nature</i>, 22 June 1905)] </p>
      <p>Of what, then, are constituted these atoms which are supposed
        to be electric, and are emitted by all bodies during their
        dissolution? The answer to this question supplies the link
        required between the ponderable and the imponderable. It is
        impossible, in the present state of science, to give a
        definition of a so-called electric particle, but we can at least
        say this: substances neither solid, liquid, nor gaseous, which
        pass through obstacles, and have no property common to matter,
        except a certain inertia, and even then an inertia varying with
        their speed, are very clearly differentiated from matter. They
        are likewise differentiated from the ether, of which they do not
        possess the attributes. They therefore form a transition between
        the two. </p>
      <p>Thus, then, the effluves emanating from spontaneously
        radioactive bodies, or from bodies capable of becoming so under
        the influence of the numerous causes we have enumerated, form a
        link between matter and the ether. And, since we know that these
        effluves cannot be produced without the definitive loss of
        matter, we have a right to say that the dissociation of matter
        realizes indisputably the transformation of the ponderable into
        the imponderable. </p>
      <p>This transformation, so contrary to all the ideas bequeathed to
        us by science,is yet one of the most frequent phenomena in
        nature. It is daily produced before our eyes; but as formerly
        there existed no reagent to show it, it was not seen. </p>

              Substance Generated by the Dematerialization of Matter.</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p><b>(1) Radioactive and Electrical Phenomena ~</b> </p>
      <p>By pursuing our researches on the dissociation of matter, we
        have been progressively led, by the concatenation of
        experiments, to recognize that electricity, of which the origin
        is so entirely unknown, represents one of the most important
        products of the dissociation of matter, and in consequence can
        be considered as a manifestation of the intra-atomic energy
        liberated by the dissociation of atoms. </p>
      <p>We have seen in the last chapter that the particles issuing
        from the radioactive substances constitute a substance derived
        from matter and possessing properties intermediate between
        matter and the ether. We shall now see that the products of the
        dissociation of matter are identical with those disengaged by
        the electrical machines in our laboratories. This generalization
        duly established, electricity in its entirety, and not simply in
        some of its forms, will appear to us as the connecting link
        between the world of matter and that of the ether. </p>
      <p>We know that the products of the dissociation of all bodies are
        identical, and only differ by the extent of the power of
        penetration belonging to them and resulting from their
        difference of speed. We have established that are composed, (1)
        of positive ions of some volume at all pressures, and always
        comprising in their structure some material parts; (2) of
        negative ions formed of electric atoms termed electrons, which
        can surround themselves in the atmosphere with material neutral
        particles; (3) of electrons disengaged from all material
        components, and able, when their speed is sufficient, to create
        x-rays by their by their impact. </p>
      <p>These various elements are generated by all bodies which are
        dissociated, and especially by spontaneously radioactive
        substances. They are also found with identical properties in the
        products obtained from Crookes’ tubes --- that is to say, tubes
        through which, after exhaustion, electric discharges are sent.
        The only difference which exists between a Crookes’ tube in
        action and a radioactive body in the course of dissociation is,
        as we have already seen, that a second produces spontaneously
        --- that is to say, under the influence of actions unknown to us
        --- that which the first produces only under the influence of
        electric discharges. </p>
      <p>Thus, then, electricity under various forms is always met with
        as the ultimate product of the dissociation of matter, whatever
        the process employed for its dissociation. It is this
        experimental fact which induced me to inquire if in a general
        way the electricity generated by any means --- a static machine,
        for instance --- might not be one of the forms of the
        dissociation of matter. </p>
      <p>But, if the analogy between a Crookes’ tube and a radioactive
        body has at length become so evident that it is no longer
        disputed, it was less easy to establish an analogy between the
        phenomena taking place in that tube and electrical discharges in
        the air at ordinary pressure. Yet they are two identical things,
        though they differ in aspect. I will now demonstrate this. </p>
      <p>When two metal rods connected with the poles of a generator are
        placed at a short distance from each other, the two electric
        fluids of contrary signs with which they are charged tend to
        recombine by virtue of their attractions. As soon as the
        electric tension becomes sufficiently strong to overcome the
        resistance of the air, they recombine violently, producing loud
        sparks. </p>
      <p>Air, by reason of its insulating qualities, offers great
        resistance to the passage of electricity; but if we do away with
        this resistance by introducing the two electrodes in question
        into an exhausted receiver, the phenomena will be very
        different. Yet in reality, nothing has been created in the tube.
        All that is found there, both ions and electrons, were already
        in the electricity which has been brought into it. At the most
        there could have been formed there new electrons arising from
        the impact of those derived from the source of electricity
        against the particles of rarified gas still left in the tube. </p>
      <p>If the effects obtained by a discharge in a vacuum tube are
        greatly different from those produced by the same discharge in a
        tube filled with air, the reason is that in the vacuum the
        electric particles are not impeded by molecules of air
        obstructing their course. In a vacuum alone can electrons obtain
        the speed necessary for the production of x-rays when they
        strike against the walls of the tube. </p>
      <p>In on case, I repeat, are ions and electrons formed in the
        vacuum tube; they are brought there from outside. They are
        elements produced by the generator of electricity. It is not in
        a Crookes’ tube that matter is dissociated; it is taken there
        already dissociated. </p>
      <p>If this be actually so, we ought to be able to meet, in the
        electric discharges produced in the air by an electric machine,
        with the various elements --- ions and electrons --- of which we
        have noted the existence in the Crookes’ tube, and which we know
        to be likewise generated by radioactive bodies. </p>
      <p>Let us, then, examine the electricity furnished by the little
        static machines of our laboratories. We might take as a typical
        generator of electricity the most simple of all, a rod of glass
        or reason giving out electricity at a tension of from two or
        three thousand volts, but its use would be inconvenient for many
        experiments. The majority of electrical machines for laboratory
        use, however, only differ from this elementary apparatus by the
        greater surface presented by the body receiving friction, and
        because it is possible by the help of various artifices to
        collect separately the positive and negative electricity at two
        different extremities called poles. </p>
      <p>The electricity issuing from a static machine possesses,
        however a considerable advantage from the point of view which
        interests us. Its output is very small, but the electricity
        issues from it at an extremely high tension, which may easily
        exceed 50,000 volts. It is just this circumstance which will
        enable us to demonstrate in the electric particles shot forth by
        the insulated poles of a static machine a strict analogy with
        the particles emitted by radioactive bodies. The electricity of
        a battery is evidently identical with that of static machines,
        but as it is turned out at the tension of a few volts only, it
        cannot produce the same effects of projection. It is probable
        also that the friction on which the construction of the static
        machines is based constitutes one means of dissociation of the
        atom, and consequently brings intra-atomic energy into play.
        This, doubtless, does not act on the molecular dissociation of
        compound bodies on which the battery is based, and this is
        probably why electricity is produced, but at a very low tension,
        which in the beast type of battery hardly exceeds two volts. If
        the output of a static machine could attain that of a small
        ordinary battery, it would constitute an exceedingly powerful
        agent capable of producing an enormous amount of industrial
        work. Suppose an electric machine worked by hand and giving out
        electricity at a tension of 50 kilovolts had an output of only
        two amperes --- that is to say, the output of the very smallest
        battery --- its yield would represent work to the extent of 100
        kilowatts, or 136 hp/sec. Given that a considerable liberation
        of energy results from the dissociation of a very slight
        quantity of matter, the creation, in the future, of such a
        machine --- that is to say, of an apparatus giving forth a power
        extremely superior to that expended in setting it in motion ---
        can be considered possible. It is a problem of which the
        enunciation would have seemed altogether absurd some ten years
        ago. To solve it, it would be enough to find the means of
        placing matter in a state in which it can be easily dissociated.
        Now, we shall see that a simple ray of sunlight is a model agent
        of dissociation, it is probable that many others will be
        discovered. </p>
      <p>If the terminal rods forming the poles are very wide apart,
        there will be seen at their extremities sheaves of tiny sparks
        named aigrettes (Figures 21 and 22) which are disengaged with a
        characteristic crackling noise. In the production of these
        elements dwells the fundamental phenomenon. It is by examining
        their composition that one notes the analogies which exist
        between the products of radioactive bodies and Crookes’ tubes,
        and those of an electrical machine. </p>
      <p>The effects obtained with the elements which issue from the
        poles vary according to the disposition of these poles, and it
        is important to remember this first of all. </p>
      <p>If we connect the two poles by a wire of any length, in the
        circuit of which we intercalate a galvanometer, the deviation of
        its magnetic needle will reveal to us the silent and invisible
        production called an electric current. It is identical with that
        which traverses our telegraph lines, and is constituted of a
        fluid formed, according to current ideas, by the conjunction of
        electric particles called electrons, which the machine
        constantly generates. </p>
      <p>Instead of connecting the poles by a wire, let us bring them a
        little closer, keeping, however, a certain distance between
        them. The electric elements of contrary signs attracting one
        another, the aigrettes we have noticed elongate considerably,
        and with a fairly powerful machine they can be observed to form
        in the dark a cloud of luminous particles connecting the two
        poles (Figure 23). <br>

      </center>
      <p>If we bring the poles still closer to one another, or if,
        without bringing them closer, we increase the tension of the
        electricity by means of a condenser, the attractions between the
        electric particles of contrary signs become much more energetic.
        These particles now condense over a smaller number of lines or
        over one line only, and the recombination of the two electric
        fluids takes place under the form of contracted, noisy and
        luminous sparks (Figure 24). But they are still constituted of
        the same elements as before, for the distance between the poles
        or the elevation of the tension are the only factors we have
        made to vary. </p>
      <p>The various effects we have just described are, naturally, very
        different from those we observe when the discharge occurs in a
        globe in which the air has been more or less rarified. The
        absence of the air produces these differences, but this gas
        exercises no action on the electric elements disengaged by
        generators of electricity. Of what do these elements consist? </p>
      <p><b>(2) Composition and Properties of the Elements Emitted by
          the Poles of an Electric Machine. Their Analogy with the
          Emissions of Radioactive Bodies ~</b> </p>
      <p>To analyze these elements, they must be studied before the
        recombination of the electric particles --- that is to say, when
        the poles are far apart and during the production of the
        aigrettes mentioned above. </p>
      <p>We shall meet in them with the fundamental properties of the
        emissions of radioactive bodies, notably those of rendering air
        a conductor of electricity and of being themselves deviated by a
        magnetic field. From the positive pole of the machine start
        positive ions, and from the magnetic pole start those atoms of
        pure electricity of defined magnitude termed electrons. But in
        opposition to what happens in a vacuum, these electrons
        immediately become the center of attraction for gaseous
        particles and transform themselves into negative ions identical
        with those produced by the ionization of gases and in all forms
        of ionization. </p>
      <p>These emissions of ions are accompanied by secondary phenomena,
        heat, light, etc., which we will examine later on. They are also
        accompanied by a projection of metallic dust torn from the
        poles, the speed of which, according to J.J. Thomson, can attain
        1800 meters/sec. </p>
      <p>The speed of projection of the ions which together form the
        aigrettes of the poles of a static machine, depends, naturally,
        on the electric tension. By raising it to several hundred
        thousand volts with a high frequency resonator, I have succeeded
        in compelling the electric particles of aigrettes to pass
        through, visibly (Figures 25 and 26) and without deviation,
        plates of insulating bodies half a millimeter thick. This is an
        experiment made some time back with the collaboration of Dr
        Oudin which I have already publishes with confirmatory
        photographs. In the experimental part of this book will be found
        the technical directions necessary for repeating it.
        Notwithstanding its importance, it made very little impression
        on physicists, though it was the first time that any one had
        succeeded in visibly transpiercing matter by electric atoms. By
        placing a glass plate between the barely separated poles of an
        induction coil, it can, as has long been known, be easily
        pierced; but this is a simple mechanical action. The aigrettes
        in our experiment go through bodies without in any way affecting
        them, just as does light. The direction of the charge proves
        that they are composed of positive ions. </p>

      </center>
      <p>The emission by the poles of an electric machine of electrons
        afterwards transformed into ions is accompanied by various
        phenomena which are met with in radioactive bodies under hardly
        different forms. To study them it is preferable to have points
        at the ends of the poles of the machine. It is then easily
        verified that what issues from an electrified point is identical
        with that which issues from a radioactive body. </p>
      <p>The only actual difference is that the point does not at
        ordinary pressure produce x-rays. When it is desired to observe
        these later, the point must be connected with a conductor
        allowing the discharge to take place in an exhausted globe. In
        this case, the production of x-rays is abundant enough, even
        though only one pole be used, to render the bone sof the hand
        visible on a screen of barium platinocyanide. </p>
      <p>The non-production of x-rays is otherwise in accordance with
        the theory. The x-rays are only generated by the impact of
        electrons having a great speed. Now, electrons formed in a
        gaseous medium at atmospheric pressure immediately change into
        ions by the addition of a retinue of neutral particles, and in
        consequence of this surcharge cannot keep up the speed necessary
        to generate x-rays. </p>
      <p>Besides this property of generating x-rays, which, moreover, is
        not common to all radioactive bodies, the particles which
        disengage themselves from an electrified point are, I repeat, in
        every way comparable to those resulting from the dissociation of
        the atoms of all bodies. They render, in fact, air a conductor
        of electricity, as Branly showed long since, and are, as J.J.
        Thomson proved, deviated by&nbsp; a magnetic field. </p>
      <p>The projection of particles of dissociated matter --- that is
        to say, of ions --- against the air molecules produces what is
        called the electric wind, by which a lamp can be extinguished
        and a whirl made to revolve, etc. It is in nowise due, as is
        constantly stated in all treatises on physics, to the
        electrification of the particles of the air, for a gas cannot be
        electrified by any process, save when it is decomposed. It is
        the kinetic energy of the ions transmitted to the molecules of
        the air which causes the displacement of these last. </p>
      <p>The ions emitted by the points with which we have equipped the
        poles of an electric machine can produce fluorescent effects
        very similar to those observed with radium. They allow us to
        imitate the effects of the spinthariscope, which renders visible
        the dissociation of matter. One has only, according to M. Leduc,
        to bring within a few centimeters of a screen of barium
        platinocyanide in the dark a rod terminating in a very fine
        point connected with one of the poles --- the positive one for
        choice --- of a static machine, the other being earthed. If the
        screen is then examined with a magnifying glass, exactly the
        same shower of sparks as is in the spinthariscope will be
        observed, and the cause is probably identical. </p>
      <p>The ions which issue from the poles of a static machine are
        not, as a rule, very penetrating --- no more so, in fact, than
        the ions which form 99% of the emission of radium. However, I
        have been able to obtain very clear photographic impressions
        through a sheet of black paper by raising the electric tension
        sufficiently (Figure 27) </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="fig27.jpg" height="369" width="371"></p>
      </center>
      It is sufficient to place the object to be reproduced&nbsp; --- a
      medal, for instance --- over a photographic plate placed on a
      sheet of metal connected with one of the poles, while above the
      metal is fixed a road communicating with the other pole. A few
      small sparks suffice. The reproduction thus obtained cannot be
      attributed to the ultraviolet light produced by the discharge,
      seeing that the medal is separated from the pate by a sheet of
      black paper, and that under these conditions it is evident that no
      light, visible or invisible, would succeed in producing an
      impression of the details of the medal. This phenomenon is,
      however, rather complex, and its thorough discussion would carry
      us too far. Hence I do not insist on the point.
      <p>The ions emitted by electrified points are most often
        accompanied by the emission of light, a phenomenon likewise
        observed in certain radioactive bodies. The spectrum of this
        light is singularly spread out. It varies, in fact, according to
        my researches, from Hertzian waves not more than two or three
        millimeters long up to ultraviolet rays, of which the length is
        under 0.230 microns. If a solar diffraction spectrum is reckoned
        at one cm length, the spectrum of the electrified points would
        be on the same scale about 30 meters long. The production of
        ultraviolet light in the spectrum of electric sparks has long
        been known and utilized, but it is, I think, M. Leduc who first
        pointed out its presence in the aigrettes from points. </p>
      <p>Yet, there remained in my mind a doubt as to its existence. In
        the whole region round an electrified point there exists an
        intense electric field capable of illuminating at some distance
        a Geissler tube, and perhaps also capable of illuminating
        fluorescent bodies. It was therefore necessary to eliminate its
        action. </p>
      <p>To separate the action of the ultraviolet light from that which
        might be due to the electric field, I made use of the large
        12-plate machine of Dr Oudin, whose action is so powerful that
        the aigrettes produced will illuminate a screen of barium
        platinocyanide or a Geissler tube at a distance of several
        meters. </p>
      <p>The separation of the action of the electric field from that of
        the ultraviolet light has been realized in the most categorical
        manner by the following experiment effected with the cooperation
        of Dr Oudin: </p>
      <p>Within a wooden cage enveloped in metallic gauze connected with
        the earth --- so as to obviate all electric action --- are
        placed Geissler tubes and metal plates, on which are traced
        letters with powdered barium platino-cyanide dissolved in gum
        Arabic. It is then found that the Geissler tubes, which shine
        brightly outside the cage, entirely cease to be luminous as soon
        as they are placed within it; while, on the contrary, the
        letters placed with the platino-cyanide and enclosed in the
        metallic cage continue to shine. The illumination of these
        latter is therefore solely due to the ultraviolet light. </p>
      <p>It results, then, from what precedes that the formation of
        electric aigrettes is accompanied by an enormous production of
        invisible light. With a high frequency resonator the quantity is
        so great that illumination of the platino-cynanide can be
        produced up to a distance of more than 5 meters. </p>
      <p>It is not for me to inquire here how ultraviolet light acts on
        fluorescent bodies. It is admitted, since the days of Stokes,
        that fluorescence comes from the transformation of invisible
        ultraviolet waves into larger, and for that reason, visible
        waves. But I must remark, by the way, that it would perhaps be
        simpler to suppose that fluorescence is due to the production
        --- under the influence of ultraviolet light, the energetic
        ionizing action of which is well known --- of slight atomic
        electric discharges from bodies which their structure renders
        capable of fluorescence. </p>
      <p>In order to determine the limits of the ultraviolet produced in
        the foregoing experiments, I made use of various screens placed
        on the platino-cyanide screen, having first ascertained their
        transparency by means of the spectrograph used in former
        researches. The active part of the ultraviolet --- that is to
        say, that which is capable of producing fluorescence --- extends
        up to about 0.230 microns. </p>
      <p>But an electrified point in discharge is not only a source of
        ultraviolet light; it also emits Hertzian waves, a fact totally
        unknown before my researches. I have indicated, in the
        experimental part of this work, the means employed to reveal
        them. By reason of their slight length, which probably does not
        exceed two millimeters, they hardly propel themselves farther
        than 40 to 50 cm (1). </p>
      <p>[(1) The Hertzian wave which always accompanies electric sparks
        is no longer electricity, but it is a phenomenon of vibration of
        the ether, and only appears to differ from light in length of
        wave. Though it has gone forth from electricity, it is able to
        reassume the ordinary electric form whenever it touches any
        substance. It then communicates to the latter a charge
        verifiable by the electroscope, and can produce sparks…] </p>
      <p>This production of Hertzian waves, visible light and invisible
        ultraviolet light, the constant companions of all emissions of
        electric particles, must be borne in mind, for it will furnish
        us later on with the key to the final process of the
        transformation of matter into vibrations of the ether when we
        take up this question in another chapter. </p>
      <p>To sum up the foregoing, we may say that a body electrified by
        any means, notably friction, is simply a body whose atoms have
        undergone the commencement of dissociation. If the products of
        this dissociation are emitted in a vacuum, they are identical
        with those generated by the radioactive substances. If emitted
        in the air, they possess properties which only differ from those
        of radioactive emissions, from their speed being less. </p>
      <p>Looked at from this point of view, electricity appears to us as
        one of the most important phases of the dematerialization of
        matter, and consequently as a form of intra-atomic energy. It
        constitutes, by reason of its properties, a semi-material
        substance intermediate between matter and the ether. </p>

      <center><b><font size="+1">Chapter III</font></b>
        <p><b><font size="+1">Comparison of the Properties of the
              Electric and the Material Fluids</font></b></p>
      </center>
      I have shown that the electric particles and the fluid they form
      by their conjunction possess an inertia of a special nature
      differing from that of matter, which, joined to other properties,
      allows us to consider electricity in all its forms as composing an
      intermediate world between matter and the ether.
      <p>We shall again meet with the properties of this intermediate
        when we compare the laws of the flow of material fluids with
        those which regulate the distribution of the electric fluid. The
        differences between these different fluids are too visible for
        it to be necessary to indicate them at length. The electric
        fluid possesses a mobility which allows it to circulate in a
        metallic wire with the speed of light, which would be impossible
        for any material substance. It escapes the laws of gravitation
        while the equilibria of material fluids are governed by these
        laws alone, etc. </p>
      <p>The differences are therefore very great, but the analogies are
        so likewise. The most remarkable of them is formed by the
        identity of the laws governing the flow of the material fluids
        and of the electric fluid. When one knows the former one knows
        the latter. This identity, which has taken some long time to
        establish, has now become classic. The most elementary treatises
        lay stress at every page on the assimilation which can be
        established between the distribution of electricity and that of
        liquids. They are careful, nevertheless, to point out that this
        assimilation is symbolical, and does not apply in every case. On
        looking a little closer into the matter, it has to be
        acknowledged, however, that it is in no wise a question of a
        simple assimilation. In a recent work the learned mathematician
        Bjerkness has shown that we have only to employ a certain system
        of electrical units for “the electric and magnetic formulas to
        become identical with the hydrodynamic formulas” (<i>Les Actions
          Hydrodynamiques a Distance</i>). </p>
      <p>A few examples will at once make evident the resemblance of
        these laws. To give them more authority , I borrow them from a
        work of Cornu, published a few years ago (<i>Correlation des
          Phenomenes d’Electricite Statique et Dynamiique</i>). </p>
      <p>It must first be remarked that the fundamental law of
        electricity, that of Ohm ( i = e/r ) might have been deduced
        from that movement of liquids in conduit pipes the properties of
        which have long been known to engineers. </p>
      <p>Here is, however, for the most important cases, the comparison
        of the laws governing these various phenomena. One of the two
        columns applies to material fluids, the other to the electric
        fluid: </p>
      <p><i>Material</i>: The outflow of a liquid per unit of time,
        through a communication tube, is proportional to the difference
        of level and in inverse ratio to the resistance of the tube. <br>
        <i>Electric</i>: The intensity of a current in a given wire is
        proportional to the difference of potential existing between the
        two extremities, and in inverse ratio to the resistance. </p>
      <p><i>Material</i>: In the fall of a liquid through a pipe from
        one given level to another likewise fixed, the work at our
        disposal is equal to the product of the quantity of liquid by
        the differences in the levels. <br>
        <i>Electric</i>: In the passage of electricity through a wire
        from one given potential to another likewise fixed, the
        available work of the electric forces is equal to the product of
        the quantity of electricity by the difference of potential
        (fall) of electricity. </p>
      <p><i>Material</i>: The height of the level in a vessel increases
        in proportion to the quantity of liquid poured into it, and in
        inverse ratio to the section of the vessel. <br>
        <i>Electric</i>: The electric potential of a conductor increases
        in proportion to the quantity of electricity yielded (charge)
        and in inverse ratio to the capacity of the conductor. </p>
      <p><i>Material</i>: Two vessels filled with liquid placed in
        communications with each other are in a state of hydrostatic
        equilibrium when their levels are the same. <br>
        <i>Electric</i>: Two electrified conductors put in connection
        with each other are in a state of electrostatic equilibrium when
        their potentials are the same. </p>
      <p><i>Material</i>: The total quantity of liquid is then divided
        in proportion to the capacities of the vessels. <br>
        <i>Electric</i>: The total electric charge is then divided in
        proportion to the capacities of the conductors. </p>
      <p>Cornu, who has carried these analogies much further than I have
        done here, is careful to remind us that these are assimilations
        of everyday use in practice, "an electric canalization must be
        treated like a distribution of water; at every point on the
        system one must make certain of the pressure necessary for the
        output". </p>
      <p>All the foregoing phenomena observed with the electric fluid as
        with the material fluids are the result of the disturbances of
        equilibrium of a fluid which obeys certain laws in regaining its
        equilibrium. Disturbances of equilibrium producing electric
        phenomena manifest themselves whenever by any means ---
        friction, for instance --- a separation is made between the two
        elements positive and negative, of which the electric fluid is
        supposed to be formed. The re-establishment of the equilibrium
        is characterized by the recombination of these two elements. </p>
      <p>It is only, as I have already said, the phenomena resulting
        from disturbances of equilibrium which are accessible to us. The
        neutral electric fluid --- the electric fluid which has not
        undergone any change of equilibrium --- is a thing we may assume
        ot exist, but no reagent reveals it. But it is natural to
        believe that it has an existence as real as that of water
        enclosed in different reservoirs, between which there is on
        alteration of level capable of producing a mechanical effect
        which would reveal the presence of the liquid. What we call
        electricity proceeds solely from phenomena resulting from the
        displacement of the so-called electric fluid or of its elements.
      </p>
      <p>We have just shown that electricity in motion acts like a
        material fluid, but why should these two substances, evidently
        so different, obey the same laws? Can the analogy of effects
        indicate the analogy of cause? </p>
      <p>We know that this cannot be, Gravity has no appreciable action
        on electricity, while it is the sole reason of the laws
        governing the flow of liquids. If a liquid passes from a higher
        to a lower level, it is because it obeys gravitation, which is
        not at all the case with electricity. The potential of a fall of
        water --- the difference in height between its starting point
        and its destination --- is entirely due to gravity; and if water
        stored at a certain height represents energy, it is because it
        is attracted towards the center of the earth --- an attraction
        which the walls that imprison it alone prevent its obeying.
        When, by tapping the reservoir, the water is allowed to flow,
        its fall produces, by reason of the earth’s attraction, a force
        corresponding to that used in raising it. Once on the level of
        the ground, it can no longer produce work. </p>
      <p>If the gravitation which governs the flow of liquids is totally
        foreign to the phenomenon noted in the circulation of the
        electric fluid, what is the cause of this last? We know that
        this cause acts exactly like gravitation, but that it differs
        from it perforce.. Although its inmost nature is unknown to us,
        we can imagine it, for observation teaches us that the electric
        fluid, by virtue of the reciprocal repulsion of its molecules,
        presents a tendency to expansion which is termed tension. His
        tendency to expansion is also observed in gases, but there it
        differs from that of the electrical fluid. This last may, in
        fact, be retained on the surface of any insulated body, while
        gases diffuse immediately unless confined by the walls of a
        hermetically sealed vessel. All modes of energy, whether
        appearing in the form of quantity or of tension, obey the same
        general laws. </p>
      <p>Thus we see continually occurring analogies --- sometimes
        close, sometimes distant --- between material things and things
        no longer material. It is precisely to the nature of these
        analogies between the ether and matter that are due the
        differences and the resemblances we have noted. </p>

      </center>
      <p>We have just shown the analogies of the electric and material
        fluids, and have noted that the laws of their distribution are
        identical. </p>
      <p>These analogies become very slight, and even finally disappear
        when, instead of examining electricity in a fluid state, we
        study the properties of the elements which appear to form this
        fluid. We know that, according to current ideas, it is composed
        of particles called electrons. This conception of a
        discontinuous --- granular --- structure of electricity, which
        goes back to Faraday and Helmholtz, has been greatly
        strengthened by recent discoveries. Suitably interpreted, it
        will enable us to bring together in a bird’s-eye view not only
        the phenomena called radioactivity, but also those previously
        known in electricity and optics, such as the voltaic current,
        magnetism, and light. The majority of these phenomena may be
        produced by simple changes of equilibrium and movement of
        electric particles --- that is to say, by displacements of the
        same thing. This we shall now demonstrate. </p>
      <p>Instead of taking a hypothetical body such as an electric atom
        or an electron, we will take in its stead, in the majority of
        cases, a small electrified metal sphere. This simple
        substitution, which does not modify the theory, has the
        advantage of making experimental verifications possible. </p>
      <p>According to whether this sphere is at rest, or in motion, or
        stopped when in motion, it will, as we shall see, produce the
        whole series of electrical and luminous phenomena. </p>
      <p>Let us take, then, a little metallic sphere, insulate it by any
        of the ordinary means, and begin by electrifying it. Nothing can
        be more simple, since it has only to be placed in contact with a
        heterogeneous substance. Two different metals separated after
        contact, remain, as is well known, charged with electricity.
        Electrification by friction, on which the old machines were
        based, only represents one particular case of electrification by
        contact. Friction, in fact, only multiplies and renews the
        heterogeneous surfaces present. </p>
      <p>This settled, let us remove our sphere to a little distance
        from the body with which it has first been put in contact. We
        then discover, by various means, that it is bound to this last
        by lines called lines of force, to which J.J. Thomson attributes
        a fibrous structure. These lines tend to bring together the
        bodies between which they exist, and have the property of
        repelling each other (Figure 6). Faraday compared them to
        springs stretched between the bodies. It is the extremities of
        these springs which constitute electric charges. </p>
      <p>Let us now remove our sphere to a great distance from the
        substance which served to electrify it by its contact. The lines
        of force which connect the two bodies remain attached to each of
        them and radiate in straight lines into space (Figure 4). It is
        to them as a whole that the name of electric field is given. </p>
      <p>If our sphere thus electrified and surrounded by radiating
        lines of force be well insulated, it will preserve its electric
        charge and produce all the phenomena observed in static
        electricity: attraction of light bodies, production of sparks,
        etc. </p>
      <p>In this state of repose the electrified sphere possesses no
        magnetic action, as is proved by its absence of effect on a
        magnetized needle. It can only acquire this property after it
        has been set in motion. Let us then put it in motion and suppose
        its speed to be uniform. Our electrified sphere will acquire,
        form the mere fact of this motion, all the properties of an
        ordinary voltaic current --- the current which circulates along
        the telegraph wires. It is even supposed, by the present theory,
        that there can be no other current than that produced by the
        movement of electrons. </p>
      <p>But since our electrified sphere in motion acts in the same
        manner as a voltaic circuit, it ought to possess all its
        properties, and consequently its magnetic action. As a fact, it
        is surrounded, by its very motion, by circular lines of force
        constituting a magnetic field. These lines envelop the
        trajectory of the electrified body, composed, as we have said,
        of radiating straight lines. </p>
      <p>This magnetic field which surrounds an electrified body in
        motion is not at all a merely theoretical view, but an
        experimental fact revealed by the deviation imparted to a
        magnetized needle placed near it. The existence of these
        circular lines of force surrounding a current can be easily
        shown by passing it through a straight rod of metal piercing, at
        right angles to its plane, a sheet of cardboard sprinkled with
        metal filings. These filings, attracted by the magnetic field of
        the current, arrange themselves in circles round the rod. So
        that by the mere fact of being set in motion an electrified body
        acquires the properties of an electric current and of a magnet.
        This is equivalent to saying that any variation of an electric
        field produces a magnetic field. </p>
      <p>But this is not all. We have supposed the speed of our
        electrified sphere in motion to be uniform. Let us now vary this
        motion, either by moderating it or by accelerating it, and new
        phenomena very different to the above will appear. </p>
      <p>The change of speed of the electrified body has for its
        consequence, by reason of the inertia of the electric particles,
        the production of the phenomena of induction --- the birth of a
        new electric force which makes itself felt in a direction
        perpendicular to that of the magnetic lines, and consequently in
        the direction of the current. The variation of a magnetic field,
        therefore, has the effect of producing an electric field. It is
        on this phenomenon that are based many machines for the
        commercial production of electricity. </p>
      <p>Another result of the superposition of this new force on the
        magnetic field of the electrified body whose movement has been
        modified, is the apparition in the ether of vibrations which
        propagate themselves therein with the speed of light. It is
        waves of this kind that are made use of in wireless telegraphy.
        In the electromagnetic theory of light accepted by all modern
        physicists, it is even supposed that these vibrations are the
        sole cause of light as soon as they are rapid enough to be
        perceived by the retina. </p>
      <p>All through the foregoing we have supposed that the electrified
        body in motion is displaced in the air or in a gas at ordinary
        pressure. If it be made to move in a vey rarified medium, still
        new phenomena of a very different order appear. These are the
        cathode rays, in which the electric atom seems to be entirely
        disengaged from all material support, and the x-rays generated
        by the impact of these electric atoms against an obstacle. Here,
        evidently we can no longer have recourse to our picture of an
        electrified sphere of metal. We must consider the electric
        charge alone, freed from the material sphere which carried it. </p>
      <p>Thus, then, as we said at the first, it is sufficient to modify
        the movement and the equilibrium of certain particles to obtain
        all the phenomena of electricity and light. </p>
      <p>The above theory is verified, in most cases, by experiments. It
        is even, in reality, only a theoretical translation of
        experiment. So far as the phenomena of light are concerned, it
        had, however, prior to the researches of Zeeman, received no
        experimental confirmation. It was only by hypothesis that it was
        supposed to be the atoms of electricity, and not matter, which
        entered into vibration in incandescent bodies. It was thought
        that a flame contained electrons in motion around a position of
        equilibrium at a speed sufficient to give birth to
        electromagnetic waves capable of propagating themselves in the
        ether, and of producing when rapid enough the sensation of light
        to the eye. </p>
      <p>To justify this hypothesis it was necessary to be able to
        deviate the electrons of flames by a magnetic field, since an
        electrified body in motion is deviable by a magnet. It is this
        deviation that Zeeman in producing by causing a powerful
        electromagnet to act on a flame. He then noticed that, on
        examining this flame with the spectroscope, the rays of the
        spectrum were deviated and doubled. From the distance between
        the spectrum lines thus separated, Zeeman was able to deduce the
        ratio e/m existing between the electric charge e of the electron
        in the flame and its mass m. This ratio was found to be exactly
        equal to that of the cathode particles in the Crookes tube. This
        measurement helps to prove the analogy of an ordinary flame with
        the cathode rays and radioactive bodies. </p>
      <p>One here sees the fundamental part played by electrons in
        current ideas. A great number of physicists consider that they
        form the sole element of the electric fluid. "A body positively
        electrified", says one of them, "is simply a body which has lost
        part of its electrons. The carrying of electricity from one
        point to another is realized by the transport of electrons from
        the place where there is an excess of positive electricity to
        the pace where there is an excess of negative electricity". The
        aptness of elements to enter into chemical compounds should
        depend on the aptness of their atoms to acquire a charge of
        electrons. Their instability should result from the loss or
        excess of their electrons. </p>
      <p>The theory of electrons allows us to explain many phenomena in
        a very simple manner, but it leaves many uncertainties still
        existing. By what mechanism does the propagation of electrons
        take place so rapidly in conducting bodies --- a telegraph wire,
        for instance? How is it that electrons pass through metals while
        these last form an absolute obstacle to the most violent
        electric sparks? Why is it that electrons which can pass through
        metals are unable to cross an interval of 1 mm vacuum, as is
        proved by bringing together the two electrodes if an induction
        coil in a tube in which a complete vacuum has been made (Hittorf
        tube)?&nbsp; Even with a coil giving a spark of 50 cm in air,
        the electricity is powerless to overcome 1mm of vacuum (1). </p>
      <p>[(1) By substituting fine needles for the electrodes I have
        sometimes obtained the passage of the current, but I draw no
        conclusions from the experiment, not being positive as to
        whether the vacuum in the tube was complete. But Cooper Hewitt
        has shown that the electric particles can be compelled to
        traverse a complete vacuum by first producing between the
        electrodes a short circuit.] </p>
      <p>The electron has become at the present day a sort of fetish for
        many physicists, by means of which they think to explain all
        phenomena. There has been transferred to it the properties
        formerly attributed to the atoms, and many consider it the
        fundamental element of matter, which would thus be only an
        aggregation of electrons. </p>
      <p>Of its innermost structure we can say nothing. It is not giving
        a very certain explanation to assure us that it is constituted
        by a vortex of the ether comparable to a gyrostat. Its
        dimensions in any case should be extraordinarily small, but can
        it be considered indivisible, which would imply that it
        possessed an infinite rigidity? May it not be itself of a
        structure as complicated as that now attributed to the atom, and
        may it not, like the latter, form a veritable planetary system?
        In the infinity of worlds, magnitude and minuteness have only a
        relative value. </p>
      <p>What appears to us most likely in the present state of our
        knowledge is that under the name of electricity are confused
        extremely different things, have in the one common quality of
        finally producing certain electric phenomena. This is an idea I
        have already dwelt on several times. But we have no more right
        to call electricity everything which produces electricity than
        we have to call heat all causes capable of generating heat. </p>

      </center>
      <p><b>(1) Former Ideas on the Structure of Atoms ~</b> </p>
      <p>Before setting forth the current ideas relating to the
        constitution of matter, I will briefly refer to those on which
        science has lived till now. </p>
      <p>According to ideas which are still classical, matter is
        composed of small indivisible elements termed atoms. As these
        appear to persist in spite of all the transformations of bodies,
        it is supposed that they are indestructible. The molecules of
        bodies, the smallest particles subsisting which exhibit the
        properties of these bodies, are composed of a small number of
        atoms. </p>
      <p>This fundamental notion has existed for over 2000 years. The
        great Roman poet Lucretius set it forth in the following terms,
        which modern books do little more than reproduce: </p>
      <p>"Bodies are not annihilated when they disappear from our view.
        Nature forms new beings with their remains. It is only by the
        death of some that it grants life to others. The elements are
        unalterable and indestructible… The principles of matter, the
        elements of the great whole are solid and eternal: no foreign
        action can change them. The atom is the smallest body in
        nature... it represents the last term of division. There
        therefore exist in nature corpuscles of unchangeable essence"
        Their various combinations change the essence of bodies". </p>
      <p>Down to the last few years nothing had been added to the above
        except a few hypotheses on the structure of atoms. Newton
        regarded them as hard bodies incapable of deformation. Lord
        Kelvin supposed them to be constituted by vortices analogous to
        those which can be formed by striking the bottom of a
        rectangular box filled with smoke, the upper side of which is
        pierced with a hole. This causes vortices to issue in the frm of
        a ring composed of gaseous threads revolving round the meridians
        of the ring. The ring is displaced as a whole and is not
        destroyed by the contact of other rings. All these vortices
        offer permanent oscillations and vibrations, the intensity and
        frequency of which are modifiable by various influences such as
        that of heat. </p>
      <p>It was largely on the old hypothesis of atoms that the theory
        termed atomic was founded during the last century. It was first
        supposed that all bodies brought to a gaseous state contain the
        same number of molecules in the same volume. Their weight,
        volume for volume, being supposed to be proportional to that of
        their atoms, it is possible, by simply weighing the body in a
        state of vapor, to ascertain what is called its molecular
        weight, from which is deduced, by a process of analysis that
        there is no need to show here, what is conveniently designated
        by the name of its atomic weight. It is compared with that of
        hydrogen taken as unity. </p>
      <p><b>(2) Current Ideas on the Constitution of Matter ~</b> </p>
      <p>It is very difficult to set forth the current ideas on the
        constitution of matter, for they are still in the course of
        formation. We are in the midst of a period of anarchy, where we
        see the former theories vanishing and those springing up which
        will serve to build up the science of tomorrow. </p>
      <p>The scholars who follow, in the reviews and scientific memoirs
        published abroad, the experiments and discussions to which are
        appended the names of the most eminent physicists, witness a
        curious spectacle. They see disappearing, day by day,
        fundamental conceptions of science which seemed established
        solidly enough to last forever. It is a regular revolution which
        is now in course of accomplishment. </p>
      <p>The interpretations which flow from the facts recently
        discovered entirely upset the very bases of physics and
        chemistry, and seem destined to change all our conceptions of
        the universe. Our highest official teaching is, in France, too
        exclusively busy in seeing that the examination manuals are duly
        conned and is too hostile to general ideas toconcern itself
        about this prodigious movement. The new philosophy of the
        sciences now coming to light has no interest for it. </p>
      <p>The scientific revolution now going on seems rapid, but this
        rapidity is much more apparent than real. The transformation of
        present ideas on the constitution of matter, which seemsto have
        taken only a few years, was prepared, in reality, by a century
        of researches. </p>
      <p>Scientific ideas, in fact, only change with extreme slowness,
        and when they seem to be abruptly modified, it is always noted
        that this transformation is the consequence of a subterranean
        evolution which has taken long years to accomplish. </p>
      <p>Five fundamental discoveries form the bases on which have been
        slowly built up the new ideas relating to the constitution of
        matter. They are: (1) the facts revealed by the study of
        electrolytic dissociation; (2) the discovery of the cathode
        rays; (3) that of the x-rays; (4) that of the bodies called
        radioactive, such as uranium and radium; (5) the demonstration
        that radioactivity does not belong exclusively to certain bodies
        and constitutes a general property of matter. </p>
      <p>The oldest of these discoveries, since, in fact, it goes back
        to Davy, is that of the dissociation of chemical compounds by an
        electric current. Various physicists, notably Faraday, later
        completed its study. It has led in succession to the theory of
        atomic electricity and to the preponderating influence which the
        electric elements have in chemical reactions and the properties
        of bodies. </p>
      <p>The second of the discoveries mentioned above give a glimmering
        idea that there might perhaps exist a condition of matter
        different to those already known; but this idea remained without
        any influence till Roentgen, examining more closely those
        Crookes’ tubes which physicists had been handling for 20 years
        without seeing anything in them, remarked that they gave out
        peculiar rays absolutely different to everything known, to which
        he gave the name x-rays. An unforeseen fact, absolutely new, and
        without any kind of analogy to known phenomena, thus burst into
        science. </p>
      <p>The discovery of of the radioactivity of uranium and radium,
        and finally of the universal radioactivity of matter, very
        closely followed that of the x-rays. The link which connected
        all these phenomena, apparently so dissimilar, was not at first
        seen. It was established byb my researches that they formed but
        one thing. </p>
      <p>Long before these last discoveries, it was well known that
        electricity played an important part in chemical reactions, but
        it was believed to be simply superposed on the material
        particles. By the discovery of electrolysis, Faraday had shown
        that the molecules of compound bodies carry a charge of neutral
        electricity of a definite and constant amount which is
        dissociated when solutions of metallic salts are traversed by an
        electric current. The molecules of bodies then came to be
        considered as composed of two elements, a material particle and
        an electric charge combined with it or superposed upon it. </p>
      <p>The ideas most commonly accepted before the recent discoveries
        are well expressed in the following passage from a work
        published a few years ago by Dr Nernst, Prof.of Chemistry at the
        University of Gottingen: </p>
      <p>"The ions are a kind of chemical combination between the
        elements or radicals and electric charges" the combination
        between matter and electricity is subject to the same laws as
        the combinations between different matters (laws of definite
        proportions, laws of multiple proportions)... If we suppose the
        electric fluid to be continuous, the laws of electrochemistry
        seem inexplicable; if, on the contrary, we suppose the quantity
        of electricity to be composed of particles of invariable size,
        the foregoing laws are evidently a consequence thereof. In the
        chemical theory of electricity, over and above the known
        elements there should be two others: the positive and the
        negative electrons". </p>
      <p>In this phase of the evolution of ideas, the positive electron
        and the negative electron were simply two new substances to be
        added to the list of simple bodies and capable of combining with
        them. The old idea of a material atom still persisted. </p>
      <p>In the present period of evolution there is a tendency to go
        much farther. After asking themselves whether this material
        support of the electron was really necessary, several physicists
        have arrived at the conclusion that it is not so at all. They
        reject it entirely, and consider the atom to be solely
        constituted by an aggregate of electric particles without other
        elements. These particles can be dissociated into positive and
        negative ions, according to the mechanism explained above. </p>
      <p>This was a gigantic step, and it is far from being one which
        all physicists have yet taken. A great uncertainty still
        dominates their ideas and their language. For the majority of
        them the material support remains necessary, and electric
        particles (electrons) are mingled with or superposed upon
        material atoms. These electrons, still according to them,
        circulate through conducting bodies, such as metals, with a
        velocity of the same order as that of light, by some mechanism
        totally unknown. </p>
      <p>To the partisans of the exclusively electrical structure of
        matter the atom is composed solely of electric vortices. Round a
        small number of positive elements there are supposed to revolve
        negative electrons, not less than a thousand in number, and
        often more. Together they form the atom, which would thus be a
        kind of miniature solar system. "The atom of matter", writes
        Larmor, "is composed of electrons, and nothing else" (Aether and
        matter, p. 137). </p>
      <p>In its ordinary form the atom would be electrically neutral. It
        would become positive or negative only when freed from electrons
        of the contrary sign, as is done in electrolysis. All chemical
        actions would be due to the loss or gain of electrons. If,
        instead of being in a state of rapid motion, the electrons were
        in repose, they would precipitate themselves on each other, but
        the velocity by which they are animated causes their centrifugal
        force to balance their reciprocal attraction. When the speed of
        rotation is reduced from any cause whatever, such as a loss of
        kinetic energy due to the radiation of electrons into the ether,
        the attraction may gain the upper hand, and the electrons tend
        to unite; if it is, on the other hand, the centrifugal force
        which gains the day, they escape into space, as is verified in
        radioactive phenomena. </p>
      <p>The atom, and consequently matter, is therefore in stable
        equilibrium, thanks only to the movements of the elements which
        compose it. These elements may be compared to a top, which
        fights against gravity as long as the kinetic energy due to its
        rotation exceeds a certain value. If it falls below this value,
        the top loses its equilibrium and falls to the ground. But the
        movements of atomic elements are far more complicated than those
        which have just been supposed. Not only are they dependent on
        one another, but they are also connected with the ether by their
        lines of force, and in reality only seem to be nuclei of
        condensation in the ether. </p>
      <p>Such is, in broad outline, the current state of the ideas in
        course of formation as to the constitution of the atoms of which
        matter is formed. These ideas can very well be reconciled with
        those I have endeavored to establish in this work, according to
        which the atom is a colossal reservoir of energy condensed in
        the form already explained. </p>
      <p>Whatever may be the future of these theories it may already be
        positively asserted that the ancient chemical atom, formerly
        considered so simple, is complicated in the extreme. It appears
        more and more as a sort of sidereal system having one or more
        suns and planets gravitating around it with immense velocity.
        From the structure of this system are derived the properties of
        the various atoms, but their fundamental elements seem to be
        identical. </p>
      <p><b>(3) Magnitude of the Elements of Which Matter is Composed ~</b>
      </p>
      <p>The molecules of bodies, and a fortiori, the atoms, are
        extremely small. The most minute microbes are enormous colossi
        compared with the primitive elements of matter: yet various
        considerations have enabled their size to be estimated. They
        give figures which no longer appeal to the mind for the reason
        that infinitely small figures are as difficult to picture as
        infinitely large ones. But it is owing to the extreme smallness
        of the elements of which atoms are formed that matter in the
        course of dissociation can emit in permanent fashion and without
        appreciably losing weight, a veritable cloud of particles. </p>
      <p>I have spoken in a former chapter of the millions of corpuscles
        per second which one&nbsp; gram of a radioactive body can emit
        for centuries. Such figures always provoke a certain amount of
        mistrust because we cannot succeed in representing to ourselves
        the extraordinary minuteness of the elements of matter. The
        mistrust disappears when one notes that very ordinary substances
        are capable, without undergoing any dissociation, of being for
        years the seat of an emission of abundant particles easily
        verified by the sense of smell, without this emission being
        discoverable by the most sensitive balances. </p>
      <p>M. Berthelot has made on this subject some interesting
        researches (Comptes Rendu A.S.P., 21 May 1904). He has
        endeavored to determine the loss of weight undergone by very
        odoriferous though slightly volatile bodies. The sense of smell
        is infinitely superior in sensitiveness to that of the balance,
        since in the case of certain substances such as iodoform, the
        presence, according to M. Berthelot, of the hundredth of a
        millionth of a milligram can be easily revealed by it. </p>
      <p>His researches have been made with this substance, and he has
        arrived at the conclusion that one gram of iodoform only loses
        the hundredth of a milligram in a year --- one milligram in a
        century, though continuously emitting a flood of odoriferous
        particles in all directions. M. Berthelot adds, that if instead
        of iodoform, musk were used, the weight lost would be very much
        smaller, "a thousand times perhaps", which would make 100,000
        for the loss of one milligram. The same scholar also remarks, in
        a later work, "that there is hardly any metallic or other body
        which does not manifest, especially on friction, odors of its
        own, which is simply saying that all bodies slowly evaporate". </p>
      <p>These experiments give us an idea of the immensity of the
        number of particles which may be contained in an infinitesimal
        quantity of matter. </p>
      <p>From various experiments, of which the most recent authors,
        Rutherford, Thomson, etc., have accepted the results, 1 cubic mm
        of hydrogen would contain 36,000 billions of molecules. These
        are figures the magnitude of which can only be understood by
        transforming them into units easy to interpret. An idea of their
        enormous magnitude will be obtained by finding out the
        dimensions of a reservoir capable of containing a similar number
        of cubic grains of sand having each a face or die of one mm. The
        above quantity of grains of sand could only be enclosed in a
        parallelepipedal reservoir with a base of 100 meters on each
        face and a height of 3,600 meters. These last figures would have
        to be much increases if we wished to represent the quantity of
        particles which one cubic mm of hydrogen would yield on the
        dissociation of its atoms. </p>
      <p><b>(4) The Forces Which Maintain the Molecular Edifices ~</b> </p>
      <p>We have seen that matter is constituted by the union of very
        complicated structural elements termed molecules and atoms. We
        are compelled to suppose that these elements are not in contact;
        otherwise bodies could neither dilate, nor contract, nor change
        their state. We are likewise obliged to suppose that those
        particles are animated by permanent gyratory movements. The
        variation of these movements alone can explain, in fact, the
        absorption and the expenditure of energy which are noticed in
        the building up and the destruction of chemical compounds. </p>
      <p>We ought, therefore, to picture to ourselves any body whatever,
        such as a block of steel or a rigid fragment of rock, as being
        composed of isolated elements in motion but never in contact.
        The atoms of which each molecule is formed themselves contain
        thousands of elements which describe round one or more centers,
        curves as regular as those of the celestial bodies. </p>
      <p>What are the forces which keep together the particles of which
        matter is formed and prevent it from falling into dust? The
        existence of these forces is evident, but their nature remains
        totally unknown. The terms cohesion and affinity which are
        applied to them tell us nothing. Observation only reveals that
        the elements of matter exercise attraction nd repulsion. We can,
        however, add to this brief statement that the atom being an
        enormous reservoir of forces, it may be supposed, as I have
        already remarked in another chapter, that cohesion and affinity
        are manifestation of intra-atomic energy. </p>
      <p>The stability of the molecular edifices bound together by
        cohesion is generally fairly great. It is, however, not enough
        to prevent chemistry from modifying or destroying it by various
        means, notably by heat. That is why it is possible to liquefy
        bodies, to reduce them to vapor, and to decompose them. The
        stability of the atomic vortices, of which the molecules are
        formed is, on the contrary, so great that it was deemed right to
        declare, after the experience of centuries, that the atom was
        unchangeable and indestructible. </p>
      <p>The cohesion which keeps together the elements of bodies
        manifests itself by the mutual attraction and repulsion of the
        molecules; and the magnitude of the forces producing cohesion is
        measured by the effort we are compelled to make in order to
        change the form of a body. It resumes its primitive state when
        the action on it ceases, which fact proves the existence in the
        bosom of mater of forces of attraction. It resists the attempt
        to compress it, which demonstrates the existence of forces of
        repulsion when the molecules come within a certain distance of
        each other. </p>
      <p>The attractions and repulsions by which cohesion is manifested
        are intense, but their radius of activity is extremely
        restricted. They cannot exercise any action at a distance, as
        does, for instance, gravitation. To nullify them we only require
        to separate the molecules of the body by heat. If the force of
        cohesion is abolished, the most rigid body is instantly
        transformed into liquid or vapor. </p>
      <p>Outside the attractions and repulsions which operate between
        the particles of the same body, there are others produced
        between the particles of different bodies which vary according
        to their nature. We describe them under the general term of
        affinity; and it is they which determine the majority of
        chemical reactions. </p>
      <p>The attractions and repulsions resulting from affinity engage
        the atoms in new combinations, or allow us to separate them from
        those combinations. Chemical reactions are only the destructions
        and restorations of equilibrium due to the affinities of the
        bodies present. One knows, by the effects of explosives, the
        power of the actions that affinity can produce when certain
        equilibria are disturbed. </p>
      <p>It is from the manner in which the atoms are grouped by the
        energy of affinity that the molecular edifices result. They may
        be very unstable, and then the least stimulus, a shock or even
        the touch of a feather, suffice to destroy them. Such is the
        case with fulminate of mercury, iodide of nitrogen, and several
        other explosives. The edifice may, on the other hand, be so
        solid that it is destroyed with difficulty. Such are those
        organic salts of arsenic, like cacodylate of soda, wherein the
        molecule is so stable that no reagent can discover the quantity,
        enormous though it be, of atoms of arsenic which it contains.
        Aqua regia, fuming nitric acid, and chromic acid are without
        action on the molecular edifice; it is a strongly built
        fortress. </p>
      <p><b>(5) The Attractions and Repulsions of Isolated Material
          Molecules and the Forms of Equilibrium Resulting from Them ~</b>
      </p>
      <p>The energies of affinity and cohesion are therefore manifested
        by attractions and repulsions. We have already seen that it is
        by these two forms of movement --- whether in the case of
        material or of electric particles --- that phenomena generally
        manifest themselves. This is why the study of them has always
        held a preponderating place in science; and many physicists
        still reduce the phenomena of the universe to the study of the
        attractions and repulsions of molecules subjected to the laws of
        mechanics. "All terrestrial phenomena", said Laplace, "depend on
        molecular attractions, as celestial phenomena depend on
        universal gravitation". Nowadays, however, it seems probable
        that the affairs of nature are more complicated. If attractions
        and repulsions appear to play so great a part, it is because of
        all the effects which forces can produce, these movements are
        the most easily accessible to us. </p>
      <p>The equilibria determined by the attractions and repulsions
        which are born in the bosom of solid bodies, are discernible
        with difficulty, but we can render them visible by isolating
        their particles. The method is easy, since it only consists in
        dissolving the solids in some suitable liquid. The molecules are
        then nearly as free as if the body were transformed into gas,
        and it is easy to observe the effects of their mutual
        attractions and repulsions. It is well known, moreover, that the
        molecules of a dissolved body move within the solvent and
        develop there the same pressure as if they were converted into
        gas in the same space. </p>
      <p>Such attractions exercised by molecules in a free state are of
        daily observation. To them are due the forms taken by a drop of
        liquid when it clings to the extremity of a glass rod. They are
        the origin of what has been called the surface tension of
        liquids, a tension in virtue of which a surface behaves as if it
        were composed of a stretched membrane. All attractions and
        repulsions can act only at a certain distance. As is known, the
        name of field of force is given to the space in which they are
        exercised, and that of lines of force to the directions in which
        are produced the attracting and repelling effects. </p>
      <p>It is in the phenomena called osmotic that molecular
        attractions and repulsions are most clearly shown. When water is
        gently poured into an aqueous solution of a salt such as copper
        sulfate, we notice by the simple difference of color that the
        liquids are at first separate, but we soon see the molecules of
        the dissolved salt diffuse themselves through the supervening
        liquid. These consequently exists in them a force which enables
        them to overcome the force of gravity. This force of diffusion
        is the consequence of the reciprocal attraction of the particles
        of water and of the dissolved salt. It has received the name of
        osmotic pressure or tension. </p>

        <p><img src="fig28-29.jpg" height="295" width="456"></p>
      </center>
      <p>All substances which possess the property of dissolving in a
        liquid attract the solvent, and conversely are attracted by it.
        Lime placed in a vessel rapidly attracts the vapor of water in
        the atmosphere, and increases in volume to the extent of
        breaking the vessel. </p>
      <p>Osmotic attractions are very energetic. In the cells of plants
        they can make equilibrium to pressures of 160 atmospheres, and
        even more according to some authors. They are rarely less than
        10 atmospheres. </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="fig30-31.jpg" height="723" width="384"></p>
      </center>
      Although the magnitude of osmotic pressure is considerable, 342
      grams of sugar dissolved in a liter of water exercising a pressure
      of 22 atmospheres, this pressure does not manifest itself on the
      walls of the vessel, because the solvent opposes resistance to the
      movement of the molecules. To measure it, the substances present
      must be separated by a partition impermeable to one of them. Such
      partitions are called for this reason semi-permeable. It might be
      more correct, perhaps, to say unequally permeable. In the case of
      plant cells these partitions are formed by the walls of the cells.
      <p>In osmotic phenomena there are always produced two currents in
        a converse direction, called exosmose and endosmose, of which
        one may overcome the other. These simple molecular attractions
        and repulsions acting in the bosom of liquids govern a great
        number of vital phenomena, and are, perhaps, one of the most
        important causes of the formation of living beings. “Osmotic
        pressure", says Van’t Hoff, "is a fundamental factor in the
        various vital functions of animals and vegetables. According to
        Vries, it is this which regulates the growth of plants; and,
        according to Massart, it governs the life of pathogenic germs".
      </p>
      <p>As the molecules existing in the midst of a liquid are able to
        attract or repel each other at a distance, they are necessarily
        surrounded by a field of force --- a region in which their
        action is exercised. By utilizing the attractions and repulsions
        of the free molecules in a liquid, M. Leduc has succeeded in
        creating geometrical forms quite analogous to those of the cells
        of living beings. According to the mixtures employed, he has
        been able to bring before us particles which attract and repel
        each other, like electric atoms. By spreading over a glass a
        solution of potassium nitrate, on which are poured two drops of
        Indian ink 2 cm from each other, two poles are obtained whose
        lines of force repel each other. To obtain two poles of contrary
        sign, a crystal of potassium nitrate and a drop of defibrinated
        blood are placed at a distance of 2 cm from each other in a
        dilute solution of the salt mentioned above. By uniting several
        drops able to produce poles of the same sign, polyhedra are
        obtained with the appearance of the cells of living beings
        (Figure 32). If, finally, a salt be crystallized in a colloidal
        solution --- gelatin, for instance --- the field of force of
        crystallization being able to act in the contrary direction to
        the osmotic attractions, the form of the crystal becomes
        altered. These researches cast a strong light on the origin of
        the fundamental phenomena of life. </p>
      <p>The above ideas on the constitution of matter may be summed up
        as follows: As soon as we lift the veil of appearances, matter,
        so inert in its outward aspect, is seen to possess an extremely
        complicated organization and an intense life. Its primary
        element, the atom, is a miniature solar system composed of
        particles revolving round one another without touching ad
        incessantly pursuing their eternal course under the influence of
        the forces which direct them. Were these forces to cease for a
        single minute, the world and all its inhabitants would instantly
        be reduced to an invisible dust. </p>
      <p>On these prodigiously complicated equilibria of intra-atomic
        life are superposed, by reason of the association of atoms,
        other equilibria which complicate them further. Mysterious laws
        known solely by some of their effects, intervene to build with
        the atoms the material edifices of which the worlds are formed.
        Relatively very simple throughout the mineral kingdom, these
        edifices gradually become complicated, as we shall now show, and
        have finally, after the slow accumulations of ages, generated
        those extremely mobile chemical associations which constitute
        living beings. </p>

        <p><b><font size="+1">Mobility and Sensibility of Matter ---
              Variations of the Equilibria of Matter Under the Influence
              of the Surroundings</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <b>(1) Mobility and Sensibility of Matter&nbsp;</b>
      <p>We have now arrived at that phase of the history of atoms
        where, under the influence of unknown causes of which we can
        only note the effects, the atoms have finally formed the
        different compounds which constitute our globe and the living
        beings upon it. Matter is born and will persist for a long
        succession of ages. </p>
      <p>It persists with different characteristics of which the most
        distinctly apparent is the stability of its elements. They serve
        to construct the chemical edifices of which the form readily
        varies but of which the mass remains practically invariable
        throughout all changes. These chemical edifices formed by atomic
        combinations, appear to be firmly fixed, but are in reality of
        very great mobility. The least variations of the medium ---
        temperature, pressure, etc. --- instantaneously modify the
        movements of the component elements of matter. </p>
      <p>The fact is, that a body as rigid in appearance as a block of
        steel, represents simply a state of equilibrium between its own
        internal energy and the external energies, heat, pressure, etc.,
        which surround it. Matter yields to the influence of these last
        as an elastic thread obeys the pull exercised upon it, but
        regains its form --- if the pull has not been too great --- as
        soon as it ceases. </p>
      <p>The mobility of the elements of matter is one of its most
        easily observed characteristics, since it suffices to bring the
        hand near the bulb of a thermometer to see the column of liquid
        immediately displaced. Its molecules consequently are separated
        by the influence of slight heat. When we place our hand near a
        block of metal, the movement of its molecules are likewise
        modified, but so slightly that it is not perceptible to our
        senses, and this is why matter appears to us to possess but
        little mobility. </p>
      <p>The general belief in its stability seems to be confirmed,
        moreover, by observing that in order to subject a body to
        considerable modifications, to melt it or change it into vapor,
        for instance, very powerful means are required. Sufficiently
        exact methods of investigation show, on the contrary, that not
        only is matter of an extreme mobility, but is further endowed
        with an unconscious sensibility which cannot be approached by
        the conscious sensibility of any living being. </p>
      <p>It is known that physiologists measure the sensibility of a
        being by the degree of excitement necessary to produce in it a
        reaction. It is considered very sensitive when it reacts under
        very slight excitants. Applying to mere matter a similar means
        of procedure, we note that the substance most rigid and least
        sensitive in appearance is, on the contrary, o an unexpected
        sensibility. The matter of the bolometer, reduced by final
        analysis to a thin platinum wire, is so sensitive that it reacts
        --- by a variation of electric conductivity --- when struck by a
        ray of light of such feeble intensity as to produce a rise in
        temperature of only the hundred millionth of a degree. </p>
      <p>With recent progress in the means of examination this extreme
        sensitiveness of nature becomes more and more manifest. Mr. H.
        Steele has found that it is sufficient to touch an iron wire
        slightly with the finger for it to become immediately the seat
        of an electric current. It is known that hundreds of miles away
        the Hertzian waves greatly modify the state of metals with which
        they come in contact, since they change in enormous proportion
        their electric conductivity. It is on this phenomenon that
        wireless telegraphy is based. </p>
      <p>The extraordinary sensibility of matter which has enabled the
        bolometer to be created and wireless telegraphy to be
        discovered, is utilized in other instruments employed in
        industry; such as, for instance, the telegraphone of Poulsen,
        which enables spoken words to be preserved and reproduced by the
        changes of magnetism brought about in the surface of a steel
        band moving between the poles of an electromagnet to which a
        microphone is attached. When you speak into the membrane of this
        last, the minute fluctuations of the current in the microphonic
        circuit cause variations of magnetism in the molecules of the
        steel ribbon of which the metal retains the trace. These
        variations permit us to reproduce the speech at will by passing
        the same band between the poles of an electromagnet put in
        circuit with a telephone. </p>
      <p>This sensibility of matter, so contrary to what popular
        observation seems to indicate, is becoming more and more
        familiar to physicists. This is why such an expression as "the
        life of matter", utterly meaningless 25 years ago, has come into
        common use. The study of mere matter yields ever-increasing
        proofs that it has properties which were formerly deemed the
        exclusive appanage of living beings. By taking as a basis this
        fact, "that the most general and most delicate sign of life is
        the electric response", Mr Bose has proved that this electric
        response "considered generally as the effect of an unknown vital
        force" exists in matter. And he shows by ingenious experiments
        ---the "fatigue" of metals and its disappearance after rest, and
        the action on these same metals of excitants, of depressants,
        and of poisons. </p>
      <p>We must not be too much astonished at finding in matter
        properties which once seemed to belong solely to living beings,
        and it would be useless to seek therein a too simple explanation
        of the still impenetrable mystery of life. The analogies
        discovered are, it is likely, due to the fact that nature does
        not greatly vary her procedure and constructs all beings, from
        mineral to man, with similar materials, whence they are endowed
        with common properties. It always applies the fundamental
        principle of least action, which would suffice by itself to
        establish the fundamental questions of mechanics. It consists,
        as we know, in the enunciation, so simple and of such deep
        import, that of all roads which lead from one situation to
        another, a material molecule under the influence of a force can
        take but one direction, namely, the one which demands the least
        effort. It will probably be seen one day that this principle is
        not only applicable to mechanics but also to biology. It is
        perhaps also the secret cause of the laws of continuity observed
        in many phenomena. </p>
      <p><b>(2) Variations of the Equilibria of Matter Under the
          Influence of the Medium ~</b> </p>
      <p>Matter is, then, like all beings, strictly dependent on the
        medium in which it finds itself, and is modified by the
        slightest changes in this medium. So long as these changes do
        not exceed certain limits, the velocity and amplitude of the
        movements of the material molecules are modified without any
        change in their relative position. If these limits are exceeded,
        the equilibria of matter are destroyed or transformed. The
        majority of chemical reactions show us such transformations. </p>
      <p>But in every way matter is so mobile and so sensitive that the
        most insignificant changes in the medium --- for instance, a
        rise or fall in temperature of a millionth of a degree ---
        produce modifications which our instruments allow us to note. </p>
      <p>Matter as we know it only represents, as I have said before, a
        state of equilibrium, a relation between the internal forces it
        contains and the external forces which act upon them. The last
        cannot be modified without a similar change in the first, as one
        pan of a balance cannot be touched without causing the other to
        oscillate. It may therefore be said, in mathematical language,
        that the properties of matter are a function of several variable
        factors, especially temperature and pressure. </p>
      <p>These various influences are capable of acting separately, but
        they may also act in combination. Thus there exists a
        temperature, variable for each body, called critical, above
        which no body can exist in a liquid state. It then immediately
        becomes gaseous and remains so whatever pressure may be brought
        to bear on it. If water is heated in a closed tube, a time
        arrives when, suddenly, it transforms itself entirely into a gas
        so invisible that the tube seems totally empty. For a long time
        many gases could not be liquefied, precisely because it was not
        known that the action of pressure was null if the gas had not
        first been lowered below its critical point. Carbonic acid is
        very easily liquefied by pressure at a temperature below 31° C.
        Above that temperature no pressure can bring it to a liquid
        state. </p>
      <p>Matter must therefore be considered as a most mobile thing,
        very unstable in equilibrium, and impossible to be conceived of
        apart from its surroundings. It possesses no independent
        property beyond its inertia, from which it derives the constancy
        of its mass. This property is absolutely the only one which no
        change of surroundings, pressure, temperature, etc., can alter.
        Take away from matter its inertia, and one does not see how it
        is possible to define so changeable a thing. </p>
      <p>Notwithstanding the extreme mobility of matter, the world,
        however, seems very stable. It so so, in fact, but simply
        because, in its present state of evolution, the medium in which
        it is wrapped varies within rather narrow limits. The apparent
        constancy of the properties of matter results solely from the
        present constancy of the medium in which it is plunged. </p>
      <p>This notion of the influence of the medium, rather neglected by
        the old chemists, has finally acquired great importance, since
        it has been proved that many reactions depend upon it, and vary
        in very different directions, according to the alterations,
        sometimes very slight, of temperature or of pressure. When the
        differences are considerable, many reactions are found to be
        entirely transformed, or to become impossible. If one could only
        examine substances at certain temperatures, one would consider
        them very different from the same substances observed at
        ordinary temperatures. At the temperature of liquid air,
        phosphorus loses its violent affinity for oxygen, and is without
        action upon it; sulfuric acid, which generally acts so markedly
        on litmus paper, no longer turns it red. At a high temperature
        we see, on the other hand, new affinities non-existent at
        ordinary temperatures come to light. Nitrogen and carbon, which
        combine with no other bodies at a low temperature, easily
        combine with several at 3000°, and form bodies hitherto unknown
        --- calcium carbide, for example. Oxygen, which generally has no
        action on the diamond, acquires so energetic an affinity for
        this body at a high temperature that it combines with it and
        becomes incandescent. Magnesium has a rather mild affinity for
        oxygen, but at a sufficiently high temperature its affinity for
        it reaches such a point that, when plunged into an atmosphere of
        carbonic acid, it decomposes it, seizes upon its oxygen and
        burns continuously when lighted. </p>
      <p>Thus, then, the elements of matter are in incessant motion: a
        block of lead, a rock, a chain of mountains have but an apparent
        immobility. They are subject to all the variations of the medium
        and are constantly modifying their equilibria to correspond to
        it. Nature knows no rest. If repose exists anywhere, it is
        neither in the world we inhabit nor in the beings on its
        surface; nor is it even existent in death, which only
        substitutes for certain momentary equilibria of atoms other
        equilibria whose duration will be as ephemeral. </p>

        <p><b><font size="+1">The Various Aspects of Matter --- Gaseous,
              Liquid, Solid, and Crystalline States</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p><b>(1) The Gaseous, Liquid, and Solid States ~</b> </p>
      <p>According to the external forces to which it is subjected,
        matter assumes three states, which have been called the solid,
        liquid, and gaseous. Yet the most recent researches have clearly
        proven that there exists no wide separation between them. The
        continuity of the liquid and gaseous states has been put in
        evidence by the researches of Van der Waals, and the continuity
        of the liquid and solid states by other experimenters. Under
        sufficient pressure, solids behave like liquids, their molecules
        slide one over the other, and a solid metal at length flows like
        a liquid. "The laws of hydrostatics and hydrodynamics", says
        Spring, "are applicable to solids subjected to strong
        pressures". This property of the hardest bodies of behaving like
        liquids under certain pressures has been utilized commercially
        in America for the manufacture of tools from blocks of steel
        subjected to sufficient pressure without the need of raising the
        temperature. Yet this metal may be regarded as the type of
        substances hardly malleable. </p>
      <p>The crystalline state itself cannot establish a very clear
        separation between the solid and liquid states. These exist, as
        Lehmann has shown, semi-liquid crystals, and I myself have found
        a means of preparing crystals of a pasty consistency (simply by
        holding a strip of magnesium with a long pair of tongs for some
        minutes in mercury). We have seen above that liquids, while
        remaining liquids, can assume geometrical forms akin to the
        crystalline state, and certain optical processes allow us to
        reveal their existence. </p>
      <p>In a general way, however, the crystalline state constitutes,
        as we shall see, a very peculiar stage of matter which gives it
        an individuality of its own, and approaches, from some points of
        view, that of living beings. </p>
      <p><b>(2) The Crystalline State of Matter&nbsp; --- Life of
          Crystals ~</b> </p>
      <p>Among the unknown forces of which we only perceive the
        existence by a few of their effects, are found those which
        compel the molecules of bodies to take strictly geometrical
        forms bearing the name of crystals. All solid bodies have a
        tendency towards the crystalline form (1). The geometrical
        equilibria from which these forms result, give a kind of
        individuality to the molecules of matter. Matter individualizes
        tehm in the same sense that the living being does --- by
        incorporating the elements borrowed from the medium itself. </p>
      <p>[(1) Prof. Quincke of Heidelberg has lately shown that all
        substances, on passing from the liquid to the solid state,
        assume what he calls a "foam structure", or become a network of
        cells which may enclose crystals (<i>Proc. Roy. Soc</i>., 21
        July `1906) </p>
      <p>There is nothing out of the way in this expression --- the
        individualization of matter --- when applied to its
        transformation into geometrical bodies. The mineral being is
        characterized by its crystalline form as the living being is
        characterized by it anatomical one. They crystal also undergoes,
        like the animal or the plant, a progressive evolution before
        attaining its final form. Again, like the animal or the plant,
        the mutilated crystal can repair its mutilation. The crystal is
        in reality the final stage of a particular form of life. </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="fig33-35.jpg" height="270" width="301"></p>
      </center>
      <p>Among the facts which may serve as supports to these
        considerations, must be especially quoted the beautiful
        experiments of Prof. Schron on the successive transformations
        which cause material molecules to assume the crystalline form.
        The three principal ones are (10 a granular phase; (2) a fibrous
        phase; (3) a homogenous phase. They are represented by the three
        photographs here reproduced, which I owe to the courtesy of the
        scolar in question. In a solution about to crystallize are first
        formed globules, in the heart of which granulations soon appear
        (Figure 33). These granulations elongate and take a fibrous
        aspect (Figure 34), to which later on succeeds the homogeneous
        state (Figure 35), which constitutes the definitive form of the
        crystal. The crystal being has then terminated its cycle. </p>
      <p>These laws of the formation of crystals are general, and can be
        observed in the crystals of mineral substances as well as in
        those which, according to Scron, accompany microorganism. Among
        the secretions of every microbe there always appear, according
        to him, crystal characteristic of every species of microbe. </p>
      <p>These observations show tha during its pre-crystalline period
        --- its infancy --- the future crystal behaves like a living
        being. It represents tissue in the course of evolution. It is an
        organized being undergoing a series of transformation of which
        the final stage is the crystalline form, as the oak is the final
        stage of the evolution of the acorn. The crystal would therefore
        seem to be the last phase of certain equilibria of matter unable
        to rise to the&nbsp; forms of higher life. </p>
      <p>Researches carried out in different directions confirm the
        above conclusions. Thus M. Cartaud has found that metals,
        polished and then attacked by picric acid dissolved in acetone,
        exhibit "a completely closed and microscopic network of cells...
        Cells and crystal show an evident affiliation. Pebbles with the
        same crystalline orientations have the characteristics of
        possessing a cellular web of specific form and disposition,
        which permits a crystal to be regarded as an aggregate of
        similar cells arranged in the same way". Cellular structure
        would therefore seem to be an embryonic phase, and crystalline
        structure an adult phase. </p>
      <p>Far from being an exceptional state, the crystalline form is,
        in reality, the one to which all forms tend, and which they
        attain so soon as certain conditions of the medium are realized.
        Salts dissolved in an evaporating solution, and a melted metal
        when cooled, always tend to assume the crystalline form; and if
        we consider, as we do nowadays, tha solutions show close
        analogies with gases, it may be said that the two most usual
        forms of nature are the gaseous and the crystalline. </p>
      <p>There is hardly anything in nature but the crystal which
        possesses a truly stable and definite form. An ordinary living
        being is, on the other hand, something extremely mobile, always
        changing, and only continuing to live on the condition that it
        dies and is reborn unceasingly. Its form only appears definite
        because our senses can only perceive fragments of things. The
        eye is not made to see everything. It picks out of the ocean of
        forms that which is accessible to it, and believes this
        artificial limit to be the real limit. What we know of a living
        being is only a part of its real form. It is surrounded by the
        vapors it exhales, by radiations of great wavelength, which it
        is constantly emitting by reason of its temperature. Could our
        eyes see everything, a living being would appear to us as a
        cloud with changing contours. </p>
      <p>Whence comes the crystal which appears in a solution? What is
        the starting point of the transformations undergone by the
        molecules of this solution before becoming a crystal?
        Observation shows that all living things from bacteria up to
        man, always proceed from an earlier being. Can it be the same
        with a crystal? Is it also derived by affiliation from an
        earlier being, or is it born spontaneously? </p>
      <p>It seems now well proved, especially since the researches of
        Oswald, that with crystals both these modes of generation exist.
        In certain fixed conditions of the medium --- of pressure,
        concentration of solutions, etc., liquids can only crystallize
        if they have first received a crystalline germ. The crystals
        thus formed may then, according to the expression of Dastre in
        his great work La Vie et la Mort, be considered as the posterity
        of an earlier crystal, absolutely in the same way that the
        bacteria developed in a solution represent the posterity of the
        bacteria originally introduced therein. </p>
      <p>There exist, however, other conditions of the medium in which
        spontaneous crystallization may be observed without any previous
        introduction of germs. These different conditions being known
        and being producible at will, A solution may be placed either in
        conditions allowing it to crystallize spontaneously or in such
        that it will only crystallize after the introduction of suitable
        germs. It may therefore be said that crystals present two very
        distinct modes of reproduction --- spontaneous generation and
        generation by affiliation. </p>
      <p>This faculty of spontaneous generation, possible to the crystal
        being is, as is well known, impossible to the living being. The
        latter is only produced by affiliation, and never spontaneously.
        However, it must be admitted that before being born by
        affiliation, the original cells of the geological periods must
        have been born without parents. We are ignorant of the
        conditions which permitted matter to organize itself
        spontaneously for the first time, but nothing indicates that we
        shall always be thus ignorant. </p>
      <p>We therefore see the notion accentuating that the crystal forms
        a being intermediate between brute and living matter, and placed
        nearer to the latter than to the former. It possesses in common
        with living beings the qualities above mentioned, and in
        particular something singularly resembling ancestral life. The
        crystalline germs we introduce into a solution in order to
        crystallize it seem to hint at a whole series of earlier lives.
        They recall the germs of living things --- the spermatozoa which
        comprise the sum of the successive forms of a race, and contain,
        notwithstanding their insignificant size, all the details of the
        successive transformations which the living being exhibits
        before, arriving at the adult stage. </p>
      <p>All the facts of this order belong to the category of
        unexplained phenomena of which nature is full, and which become
        more numerous as soon as we penetrate into unexplored regions.
        He complexity of things seems to increase the more they are
        studied. </p>

        <p><b><font size="+1">The Unity of the Composition of Simple
              Bodies</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p><b>(1) Are the Different Simple Bodies Compounded From One
          Element?</b> </p>
      <p>When we submit the various compounds existing in nature to
        certain chemical operations, we succeed in separating them into
        elements which no reaction can further decompose. These
        irreducible elements are termed simple bodies, or chemical
        elements. From their combinations are formed our globe and the
        beings which inhabit it. </p>
      <p>The idea that all bodies are supposed to be simple must be
        derived from one single element in different states of
        condensation or combination, come so naturally to the mind that
        it was put forth directly chemistry was established. After
        having been abandoned for want of proof, it was reborn when the
        recent experiments on the dissociation of matter seemed to show
        that the products resulting from the dissociation of the various
        bodies are formed of the same elements. </p>
      <p>Facts known at an early date already indicated that the atoms
        of the most dissimilar bodies possessed certain properties in
        common. The most important of these are the identity of the
        specific heat and of the electric charge when, instead of with
        like weights of matter, we work with quantities proportional to
        the atomic weights. </p>
      <p>Every one knows that the specific heat of bodies --- the
        quantity of heat, expressed in calories, which has to be
        communicated to them in order to raise their temperature the
        same number of degrees --- varies with different bodies. It is
        thus that, with the amount of heat necessary to raise a kilogram
        of water by 3°, the temperature of a kilogram of mercury can be
        raised by 97°. But if, instead of comparing equal weights of the
        different substances, weights proportional to their atomic
        weight are compared, it is noted that all bodies experience the
        same amount of heating from the same amount of heat, while
        electrolysis also proves that they carry an electric charge
        identical for the same atomic weight. To these facts, long
        known, are added those resulting from the recent researches here
        described, which show that, by the dissociation of matter, the
        like products are obtained from the most different bodies. It
        may therefore be admitted as extremely likely that all bodies
        are formed of one and the same element. </p>
      <p>But even were the demonstration of this unity of composition
        complete, it would offer only a slight practical interest. By
        chemical analysis the same elements are discovered in a painting
        by Rembrandt as in a public-house signboard, and it is likewise
        proved that the body of a dog and that of a man have the same
        composition. Such observations as these give us absolutely no
        knowledge of the structure of the bodies thus analyzed. So far
        as atoms are concerned, what we desire to discover is the
        architectural laws which have enabled completely different
        edifices to be created with similar materials. Nothing is more
        probable than the fact that the atoms of chlorine, of zinc, and
        of the diamond are composed of one element. But how can this
        element give the elements of the various substances such
        different properties? Of this we are so completely ignorant that
        we are unable even to formulate any hypothesis on the subject. </p>
      <p>Whatever may be the nature of the equilibria existing in the
        elements of the atoms of the various simple bodies, it is
        certain that these equilibria possess, in spite of their
        mobility, a very great stability since, after the most violent
        chemical reactions, the simple bodies are always again found
        unaltered. None of the transformations to which a given quantity
        of any element may be subjected modify either its nature of its
        weight. It is for this very reason that atoms have hitherto been
        considered indestructible. </p>
      <p>This apparent indestructibility has always given great force to
        the belief in the invariability of chemical species. We shall
        see, however, that by looking a little closer into things, this
        argument loses much of its value; for, without involving the
        phenomenon of the dissociation of matter, we shall prove that
        the same bodies may really undergo very thorough transformations
        of properties, which sometimes even suggest actual
        transmutations. </p>
      <p>(2) <i>Can Simple Bodies be Considered as Elements of an
          Unvarying Fixity?</i> </p>
      <p>At the beginnings of chemistry the methods of analysis somewhat
        lacked refinement and the process of physical investigation,
        such as spectroscopy, were unknown. It was thus that arose with
        well defined properties. These bodies were too visibly different
        to be possibly confused. It was thus that arose the doctrine,
        analogous to that then admitted in biology, that chemical
        species were, like the species of living beings, invariable.
        Yet, after half a century of patient observation, biologists
        have finally abandoned the idea of the invariability of species,
        while chemists still defend it. </p>
      <p>The facts discovered have shown, however, that there exists
        between chemical species as between Living species, transition
        at a good number of simple bodies by no means which cannot be
        disputed. It has had to be recognized that a good number of
        simple bodies by no means present clearly defined properties
        which allow them to be easily differentiated. There are many, on
        the contrary, so near to each other, possessing qualities so
        much alike, that no chemical reaction can distinguish them; and
        it was for this very reason that they were so long unknown.
        Almost a quarter of the simple bodies known --- about 15, so
        resemble each other in their chemical characteristics that
        without the employment of certain methods of physical
        investigation (spectrum rays, electrical conductivity, specific
        heat, etc.) they could never have been isolated. These bodies
        are those metals the oxides of which form what are termed the
        "rare earths". "They are only distinguished", say M. Wyrouboff
        and Verneuil, "with but two or three exceptions, by their
        physical properties and are chemically identical. So much is
        this the case that no reaction has yet been found to separate
        them, and one is reduced, in order to obtain them in a more or
        less pure state, to the empirical and rude process of
        fractionation". </p>
      <p>Other recently discovered facts show that the most marked
        chemical species, such as ordinary metals, present numerous
        varieties. There exists, probably, round each element, a whole
        series of varieties with common characteristics, which possess,
        however, properties sufficiently sui generis for them to be
        distinguished; as is observed in living species. Silver, as we
        shall presently see, is not one single metal. There exist at
        least 5 or 6 kinds of silver, constituting very different simple
        bodies. It is the same with iron and, probably, with all the
        other metals. </p>
      <p>The earlier chemistry carefully noted the existence of bodies
        seemingly identical in nature though differing in properties. It
        termed "allotropic" these different states of a same body. If it
        did not class them, as independent simple bodies, it was because
        by means of various reagents they could always be brought back
        to a common state. Red phosphorus differs entirely from white.
        And the diamond differs no less from carbon from carbon; but
        either white phosphorus or red can give the same compound ---
        namely, phosphoric acid. With either coal or the diamond the
        same compound can also be made --- namely, carbonic acid. </p>
      <p>Without these common properties we should never have dreamed of
        classing together bodies so widely dissimilar as the coal and
        the diamond, or white and red phosphorus. White phosphorus is
        one of the bodies most greedy for oxygen and red phosphorus one
        of the least so. White phosphorus melts at 44° C, while red will
        not melt at any temperature and turns into vapor without passing
        through the liquid state. The first is one of the most poisonous
        bodies known, while the second is one of the most innocuous.
        Equally marked differences exist in greatly differing forms. M.
        Coste has shown that selenium slowly cooled is a good conductor
        of electricity, for which reason he has given it the name of
        metallic selenium. Ordinary vitreous selenium obtained by rapid
        cooling is, on the contrary, an insulator, and consequently no
        longer possesses the properties of a metal. </p>
      <p>So long as the allotropic state was only observed in a very
        small number of bodies it was possible to look upon them as
        exceptions, but more sensitive methods of investigation have
        proved that what was considered exceptional constitutes, on the
        contrary, a very general law. The learned astronomer Deslandres
        supposes that the great differences observable in the spectrum
        of many bodies --- carbon and nitrogen, for instance ---
        according to the temperature at which they occur, are due to the
        allotropic states of these bodies” (<i>Comptes Rendu</i>, 14
        Sept. 1903). </p>
      <p>Without the need of invoking the hints supplied by spectrum
        analysis, it is very easy to note that the commonest and most
        distinguishable bodies, such as iron and silver, display many
        different allotropic states which allow us to class them as
        different species of the same genus. There are already half a
        dozen different kinds of iron and silver known which have
        clearly defined characteristics, although they possess certain
        reactions in common which formerly led to their being confused.
        It is probable that with new methods of observation the number
        of these species will be greatly increased. Recent researches on
        the colloidal metals, which we shall refer to in another
        chapter, are capable of being so modified as to lose all the
        properties of the metal from which they are derived and to
        resemble organic substances rather than metals. </p>
      <p>But without even glancing at these extreme cases of colloidal
        metals, and only taking the most ordinary bodies, prepared by
        the absolutely classic methods, it has to be acknowledged, as we
        shall see, that the same metal can present itself in the forms
        impossible to be confused. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;It is known that the heat absorbed or disengaged by the
        various simple bodies, in their combinations, is a constant
        quantity, represented by exact figures, and that it constitutes
        one of their essential characteristics. These figures, formerly
        considered invariable for each body, have served to found a
        special science --- to wit, thermo-chemistry, </p>
      <p>As soon as the allotropic forms of metals became known, these
        figures were taken in hand and it had to be acknowledged that,
        according to the mode of preparation of the metal, they might be
        20 times higher or lower than the figures found for this same
        bodies when prepared by different methods. It cannot be said,
        for a great number of the figures published up to now, that they
        are even roughly approximate. It was Berthelot himself, one of
        the founders of thermo-chemistry, who contributed to the
        verification of this fact (1). It is very probable that had he
        done so 30 years earlier, thermo-chemistry would never have been
        born. </p>
      <p>[(1) Here, moreover, are the figures obtained for silver by M.
        Berthelot according to the kind of metal employed --- see
        Comptes Rendus, 4 February 1901. These figures represent the
        heat of the solution of an equal weight of substance in mercury:
      </p>
      <p>(a) Silver in thin leaves, +2.03 cal <br>
        (b) Silver produced by the transformation of the above metal
        heated for 20 hr at 500-550 C in a current of oxygen, +0.47 cal
        <br>
        (c) Silver crystallized in needles; obtained by electrolysis
        from silver nitrate dissolved in 10 parts water: + 0.10 cal; <br>
        (d) Silver precipitated from its nitrate by copper, washed and
        dried, partly at the normal temperature: + 1.10 cal <br>
        (e) The above silver dried at 120 C: + 0.76 cal <br>
        (f) The above silver heated to a dark red: + 0.08 cal.] </p>
      <p>From the standpoint taken by me as to the variability of
        chemical species, these results are of the greatest interest.
        From the standpoint of the ideas hitherto dominant on which
        thermo-chemistry was founded, they are plainly disastrous. M.
        Berthelot urges this by the following considerations: </p>
      <p>"Such inequalities of energy as these being thus established by
        experiment, it is clear that there cannot be accorded with
        certitude to ordinary metals, nor, more generally, to elements;
        in the discussion of their reactions, the thermo-chemical values
        attained by starting from different states. </p>
      <p>"The states of silver that I have studied do not, with one
        exception, answer to the figures of +7 cal for the heat of
        formation of the oxide Ag2O which is given in thermo-chemical
        treatises. </p>
      <p>In the case of silver the thermo-chemical difference of the
        states of this element may rise, for one atom of silver, to 2
        calories, which makes, for the formation of oxide, with 2 atoms
        of silver (AgO) a difference of +4 calories". </p>
      <p>The figures given in the books would then be, in the above
        case, wrong by nearly 50%. The same author then asks himself
        whether it might not be the same with iron, of which so many
        allotropic forms occur. The observation is probably applicable,
        not only to iron, but to all other bodies. What therefore is
        there left of all the figures which thermo-chemistry formerly
        displayed as so infallible? </p>
      <p>There will probably remain very little, for even if we start
        from metals prepared in the same way, there is no certainty of
        starting from an identical body, since its simple dessication
        temperature permits its heat of combination to vary, and it is
        sufficient to very slightly change its physical state to also
        change its thermal properties. Faraday remarked that silver,
        deposited on a plate of glass by chemical means, had a great
        refracting power and a very feeble transparence. Faraday
        concluded from this that silver, in these two cases, must
        represent very different forms. And this prediction has been
        fully confirmed by experiment. </p>
      <p>At the time when the figures of thermo-chemistry were
        established, chemists could not have reasoned other than they
        did, since they were not then able to differentiate bodies
        except by reactions incapable of bringing to light certain
        dissimilarities which were, however, fundamental. Silver,
        whatever its origin, when treated by nitric acid, invariably
        yielded silver nitrate of the same composition percent, and one
        could always extract from it the same quantity of metallic
        silver. How then was it possible to suspect that there existed
        in reality metals differing from each other, although
        representing the same appearance and known by the name of
        silver? </p>
      <p>We nowadays know this because our methods of investigation have
        been perfected. When they are still more perfect, it is
        probable, as I have said before, that the number of chemical
        species derived from the same body will further increase. </p>
      <p>The foregoing facts establish this important general law; that
        simple bodies are by no means composed of determined elements
        invariable in structure, but of elements which can be varies
        within rather wide limits. Every simple body only represents a
        type from which greatly different varieties are derived. B y
        adopting for the classification of metals that employed for
        living beings, it might be said that a metal like silver or iron
        constitutes a genus which includes several species. All the
        species of the same genus, the genus iron and the genus silver,
        for example, are absolutely distinct though possessing common
        characteristics. And if we consider that in the mineral world
        species are modified with some ease since, for instance, the
        white phosphorus species may become the red phosphorus species,
        or that the silver species, capable of disengaging many calories
        in its combinations, may become a species which disengages a
        smaller number, it is allowable to affirm that chemical species
        are much more easily transformable than animal species. It is
        not a matter for wonder, since the organization of the latter is
        much more complicated than that of the former. </p>
      <p>Chemical species, then, are subject to variability. We know, on
        the other hand, that given certain appropriate actions, atoms
        may undergo the beginning of dissociation. May we hope, on the
        contrary, to succeed in totally transforming a simple body? This
        is the problem which we will now proceed to examine. </p>

      <p><b>(1) Variability of Simple Bodies ~</b> </p>
      <p>"It is very rare" the celebrated chemist Dumas, "that one
        succeeds in comprehending the laws of a whole class of
        phenomena, by studying those whose action is displayed with the
        greatest intensity. It is generally the contrary which is
        observed, and it is nearly always by the patient analysis of a
        slight or slow phenomenon that one succeeds in discovering the
        laws of those which at first escaped analysis. </p>
      <p>The whole history of science confirms this view. It was by
        attentively examining the oscillations of a hanging lamp that
        Galileo discovered the most important laws of mechanics. It was
        by a lengthened study of the shadow of a hair that Fresnel built
        up the theories which transformed the science of optics. It was
        by analyzing, with rudimentary apparatus, minute electric
        phenomena that Volta, Ampere, and Faraday called forth from the
        void a science which was shortly to become one of the most
        important factors in our civilization. </p>
      <p>"It is certain that in the future as in the past", writes
        Poincare, "the most profound discoveries, those which will
        suddenly reveal regions entirely unknown, and open up perfectly
        fresh horizons, will be made by a few men of genius who will
        pursue in solitary meditation their stubborn labor, and who, to
        verify their boldest conceptions, will doubtless require only
        the most simple and least costly methods of experiment". </p>
      <p>Considerations such as these should always be borne in mind by
        independent seekers when they find themselves stopped from want
        of means, or by the indifference or hostility which most often
        requites their labors. There exists, perhaps, no physical
        phenomena which, studied with patience in all its aspects, will
        not finally reveal, tanks to very simple means of investigation,
        totally unexpected facts. It was thus that the attentive study
        of the effluves generated by light on the bit of metal struck by
        it was the origin of all the researches noted in this work, and
        finally led me to demonstrate how little foundation there was
        for the century old dogma of the indestructibility of matter. </p>
      <p>The great interest of such researches, when stubbornly followed
        up, consisted in constantly seeing new facts appear, and in
        never knowing into what unknown region one will be led. I have
        noticed this more than once during the many years devoted to my
        experiments. Undertaken with quite another object, they led me
        to study experimentally the question of the variability of
        chemical species; and if I give the preceding explanations, it
        is somewhat to excuse myself for having treated of a subject
        which would seem, at first sight, outside the scope of my
        researches. </p>
      <p>From the philosophical point of view, the problem of the
        variability of chemical species is of the same order as that of
        the variability of the species of living organisms, which has
        for so long agitated science. Energetically denied at first,
        this variability of species has at last been accepted. The
        principal argument which led to its adoption is the extent of
        the variations to which beings can be subjects, although no one
        has ever succeeded in obtaining very great variations of some
        chemical species, the possibility of their transformation may be
        admitted for reasons of the same order as those which have
        appeared convincing to biologists. </p>
      <p>The variability of chemical species, put in evidence in the
        preceding chapter by the simple statement of facts already
        known, needed to be first discussed in order to prepare the
        reader for the interpretation of the experiments I will now
        detail. </p>
      <p>To obtain the transformation of certain bodies we shall require
        no energetic means, such as high temperature, great electric
        potential, or the like. I have already shown that matter, very
        resistant to mighty agencies, is on the contrary sensitive to
        slight excitants on condition that they are appropriate. It is
        precisely for this reason that, notwithstanding its stability,
        it can be dissociated under the influence of slight causes, such
        as a feeble ray of light. </p>
      <p>I have already pointed out the very important part played by
        traces of a foreign substance when added to certain bodies. Its
        importance struck me as soon as I saw such curious properties as
        phosphorescence and such capital ones as radioactivity produced
        by the influence of such admixtures. If such important phenomena
        can be created by such very simple means, may it not be
        possible, by proceeding in an analogous manner, to succeed in
        modifying all the fundamental properties of certain elements? </p>
      <p>By fundamental properties we understand those apparently
        irreducible ones upon which chemists rely for their
        classification. Thus, the property possessed by aluminum of not
        decomposing water when cold and of not being oxidized at the
        ordinary temperature constitutes one of the fundamental
        characteristics of this metal. If it can be compelled to oxidize
        water by simply adding to it traces of certain bodies, we shall
        evidently have the right to say that its fundamental properties
        have been modified. </p>
      <p>As these experiments are merely accessory, since they go beyond
        the scope of my researches, I have only brought them to bear on
        three metals, namely aluminum, magnesium, and mercury. And as,
        although very simple, they necessitate certain technical
        explanations, I refer the reader for their detailed description
        to the purely experimental part of this work. It will there be
        seen that by putting the first two of these metals in the
        presence of traces of various substances --- for example,
        distilled water which has served to wash out an empty flask
        previously containing mercury --- it becomes possible to modify
        their characteristics that, if classified according to their new
        properties, their places in the list of elements would have to
        be altered. Thereafter, these metals, which are generally
        without any action on water, decompose it violently; the
        aluminum instantaneously becomes oxidized in air, becoming
        covered with thick tufts which grow under one’s eyes, and which
        give to a plate of polished aluminum the look of a jungle (See <i>Bulletin









          de l’Institut Egyptien</i>, Sec. 4, 19 November 1904, pp. 464
        et seq.). </p>
      <p>Several hypotheses were put forward to explain these facts when
        presented in my name to the Academie des Sciences. M. Berthelot
        pointed out that two metals in the presence of each other might
        form an electric couple which might be the origin of the
        phenomena noticed, and that, therefore, it would not be the
        properties of metals which were under observation but those of
        their couples. This is evidently a very insufficient
        explanation. </p>
      <p>Other scholars have compared the metals this transformed to
        alloys which, according to certain ideas now in vogue, are
        constituted by combinations in defined proportions, dissolved in
        the excess of one of the metals in question. But in alloys, the
        changes obtained, such as hardness, fusibility, etc., are
        especially of a physical order, and in none of them are observed
        chemical transformations similar to those I have obtained. </p>
      <p>By extending these researches, a large number of facts of the
        same order will certainly be discovered. Chemistry already
        possesses a certain number of them. There are, perhaps, as I
        have said, no bodies more dissimilar than white and red
        phosphorus. In certain of their fundamental chemical properties,
        amongst them their capacity for oxidation, they differ from each
        other almost as much as sodium from iron. Yet it is sufficient
        to add to white phosphorus traces of iodine or of selenium to
        transform it into red phosphorus. </p>
      <p>The instances of iron and steel and of pure and ordinary iron
        are no less typical. It is known that steel, so dissimilar to
        iron in hardness and in appearance, only differs from it
        chemically by the presence of a few thousandth parts of carbon.
        It is also known that the properties of pure iron are absolutely
        different from those of ordinary iron. This last, in fact, does
        not oxidize in dry air. Pure iron obtained by reducing iron
        sesquioxide by means of heated hydrogen is so oxidizable that it
        spontaneously ignites in air, whence the name of pyrophoric iron
        given to it. </p>
      <p>It might even be well, in the presence of such facts, to
        inquire whether the classic properties of several ordinary
        metals may not be solely due to some infinitesimal quantity of
        other bodies, the presence of which is often hidden from us, and
        which we call impurities when they are revealed to us by
        analysis. We shall see that the diastases, the most important
        compounds of organic chemistry, lose all their [properties when
        deprived of the traces of certain metals whose existence was
        formerly not even suspected. </p>
      <p>The facts put in evidence by my researches and by those of the
        same order which I have brought together seem therefore to prove
        that simple bodies have not the invariability attributed to
        them. To admit that they are not invariable is to say that it
        may become possible to transform them, and to come back to the
        old problem of the transmutation of substances which so
        exercised the alchemists of the middle ages, and which modern
        science has finally judged to be as unworthy of its researches
        as the squaring of the circle or perpetual motion. Long
        considered as chimerical, it nowadays comes again to the front
        and occupies the minds of the most eminent chemists. </p>
      <p>"The great modern discovery to be realized today", wrote M.
        Moissan, "would not therefore be to increase by a single unit
        the number of our elements, but, on the contrary, to diminish it
        by passing in methodical fashion from one simple body to
        another... Shall we finally attain that transformation of simple
        bodies into one another which would play in chemistry as
        important a part as the idea of combustion when grasped by the
        acute mind of Lavoisier? Great questions here stand for
        solution. And this mineral chemistry, which we thought to be
        exhausted, is yet only at its dawn". In reality, on the modern
        theory of electrolytic dissociation, chemists are obliged to
        admit, as everyday occurrences, transmutations quite as singular
        as those dreamed of by the alchemists, since it suffices to
        dissolve a salt in water to entirely transform its atoms. </p>
      <p>It is known that, according to the theory even then old but
        greatly developed a few years ago by Arrhenius, in an aqueous
        solution of salt (potassium chloride, for example), the atoms of
        the chloride and potassium separate and remain present in the
        bosom of the liquid. Potassium chloride is dissociated by the
        sole fact of its solution into chlorine and potassium. But, as
        potassium is a metal which cannot remain in water without
        violently decomposing it, nor find itself in presence of
        chlorine without energetically combining with it, it must
        perforce be admitted that the chlorine and the potassium of this
        solution have acquired new properties bearing no analogy to
        their ordinary properties. It follows from this that their atoms
        have been entirely transformed. This is acknowledged, moreover,
        since the phenomenon is interpreted by the assertion that the
        differences noted are due to the fact that, in the solution, the
        atoms of chlorine and the atoms of potassium are formed of ions
        bearing electric charges of opposite signs, which would
        neutralize each other in ordinary chlorine and potassium. There
        must therefore exist two very different kinds of potassium, the
        potassium of the laboratory with all the properties we observe
        in it, and the ionized potassium without any relationship to the
        first; and the case is the same with chlorine. This theory has
        been accepted because it facilitates calculations, but it will
        be evident that it would lead us to consider the atom as the
        easiest thing in the world to transform, since it would suffice
        to dissolve a body in water in order to obtain a radical
        transformation of its characteristic elements. </p>
      <p>Several chemists, moreover, formerly went some length in this
        direction. H. Sainte-Claire Deville declared to his pupils that
        he did not believe in the persistence of elements in compounds.
        W. Ostwald, Prof. of Chemistry at the University of Leipsic,
        likewise affirms that the elements cannot continue to subsist in
        chemical combinations. "It is", according to him, "contrary to
        all evidence to allow that matter in a chemical reaction does
        not disappear and make room for another matter endowed with
        different properties". Iron oxide, for instance, would nowise
        contain iron and oxygen. When oxygen is made to act on iron, a
        complete transformation is effected of the oxygen and iron, and
        if, from the oxide thus formed, oxygen and iron are subsequently
        extracted, it is only by performing the converse transformation.
        "Is it not nonsense", writes M. Ostwald, "to claim that a
        definite substance can continue to exist without possessing any
        of its original properties? In point of fact, this purely formal
        hypothesis has only one object --- that is, to make the general
        facts of chemistry agree with the utterly arbitrary notion of an
        unalterable matter". </p>
      <p>It certainly seems to result from what has been said above that
        the equilibria of the elements constituting the atoms can be
        easily modified, but it is indisputable also that they have an
        invincible tendency to return to certain forms of equilibrium
        special to each; since, after every possible modification, they
        are always able to return to their primary form of equilibrium.
        It may therefore be said that, in the present state of science,
        the variability of chemical species is proved, but that with the
        means at our disposal it is only realizable within certain
        limits. </p>
      <p><b>(2) Variability of Compound Bodies ~</b> </p>
      <p>What I have just said of the variability of simple bodies and
        of the means which allow it to be effected applies equally to
        compound chemical bodies. There exists at the present day a very
        important industry --- that of the manufacture of incandescent
        lamps --- founded on nothing but the principle of the
        transformation of certain properties of compound bodies in the
        presence of slight quantities of other bodies. When the mantles
        of these lamps are soaked in pure thorium oxide, they do not
        become luminous on heating, or only very slightly so; but if the
        thorium oxide one percent of cerium oxide is added, the
        incandescence diminishes at once. This was a very unforeseen
        phenomenon, and is the reason why the creation of this mode of
        illumination required lengthy researches. </p>
      <p>But it is, perhaps, in the chemical phenomena which occur in
        the interior of livin beings that this same principle can be
        more frequently verified. Divers diastases entirely lose their
        properties of they are stripped of the traces of mineral
        substances they contain, especially manganese. It is probable
        that bodies like arsenic, which is now extracted in
        infinitesimal doses from many tissues, exercise an important
        influence unsuspected by the earlier chemistry. </p>
      <p>It is probably to the actions exercised by the presence of
        bodies in very small quantities that are due the differences
        observed in compounds formerly considered identical, which,
        however, would seem to vary with their origin. In former times
        well-defined radicals such as sugar, chlorophyll, hemoglobin,
        nicotine, the volatile essences, etc., were considered as
        identical, no matter from what living being they came. But
        Armand Gauthier has established that this is an error: "Though
        still appertaining to the same chemical family, these radicals,
        when isolated and closely studied, are modified from one
        vegetable race to another by isomerization, substitution, and
        oxidation: they have become, in short, other definite chemical
        species. It is the same with the animal kingdom. There is not
        one hemoglobin, but several hemoglobins, each proper to its own
        species". </p>
      <p>In noting these differences between bodies similar to each
        other, but of different origin, Gauthier does not give their
        causes. It is by analogy that I have supposed the said
        differences to be produced by traces of various substances, and
        by variations in their quantity. I have already pointed out that
        organic ferments lose their properties the moment they are
        deprived of the small proportion of metallic matter they always
        contain. Hemoglobin, which seems to act as a catalytic ferment,
        contains quantities of iron varying greatly with the animal
        species. </p>
      <p>This principle of the transformation of the properties of a
        substance by the addition of a very small quantity of another
        body has thus plainly a general importance. Yet it is only the
        enunciation of empirical observations, of which the secret
        causes still remain hidden. The particular combinations thus
        formed, to which we shall return in a subsequent chapter,
        altogether escape the fundamental laws of chemistry. </p>
      <p>The various applications I have made of this principle have
        proved to me that it will be fruitful and of practical use, not
        only in chemistry and physiology, but also in therapeutics. I
        base this assertion on some studies which I undertook several
        years ago on the totally new properties caffeine assumes when
        associated under certain conditions with very small doses of
        theobromine (an alkaloid which, when isolated, only acts on the
        organism in very large doses). From experiments made with
        registering instruments on various patients, several of which
        have been repeated in one of the laboratories of the Sorbonne by
        Prof. Charles Henry, theobromized caffeine would seem to be the
        most energetic muscular stimulant known. Observations made on a
        certain number of artists and writers have likewise proved its
        singular power on intellectual activity. </p>
      <p>Experiments on the variability of compound chemical species
        have evidently not the same importance as those relating to the
        variability of simple bodies, since chemistry has for a long
        time known how to modify compound bodies by various reactions.
        If I have detailed them, it is to show that the principle of the
        method which permits the properties of simple bodies to be
        varied is applicable to many compound bodies, and to draw
        attention to its consequences in advance. In the early mineral
        chemistry, any compound bodies --- silver nitrate, for instance
        --- were considered as sharply defined substances formed by the
        combination of certain elements in strictly constant proportion.
        They are probably nothing of the kind. The law of definite
        proportions os no doubt only an approximate law like the law of
        Mariotte, and only owes its apparent correctness to the
        insufficiency of our methods of observation. </p>
      <p>Insofar as the variability of simple bodies is concerned, it
        should be pointed out that a very serious reason, deduced from
        my researches, will no doubt always be opposed to the subjection
        of the atom to complete transformations of equilibrium. I have
        shown that it is a reservoir of colossal energy. It seems
        therefore probable that to transform it entirely would require
        quantities of energy far superior to those at our command. </p>
      <p>But experiment proves that, without being able to definitely
        destroy the atomic equilibria, we are allowed to modify them. We
        know, also, that by very simple means we can provoke the
        dissociation of matter and consequently liberate a part of its
        energy. If, therefore, it is found impossible to add enough
        energy to the atom to transform it, we may at least hope to
        deprive it of a part of its energy, to cause it to go down a
        step which it cannot retrace in the scale of its successive
        steps. The atom deprived of a certain amount of energy can no
        longer be in the same state as before it lost it. Then it is, no
        doubt, that a veritable transmutation would appear. </p>
      <p>Bringing together the facts above demonstrated we arrive at
        this conclusion. Matter, from which our experiments have
        banished immortality, no longer has the fixity attributed to it.
        It follows further that all the ideas still dominant on the
        invariability of chemical species seem sentenced to disappear.
        When we see how profound are the so-called allotropic
        transformations, the transformation of bodies in electrolytic
        solutions and the complete transformations of several metals in
        the presence of small quantities of certain substances; when too
        we see the facility with which bodies dissociate and reduce
        themselves to the same elements, we are naturally led to the
        renunciation of classical ideas and to the formulation of the
        following principle: </p>
      <p>Chemical species are not invariable, any more than are living
        species. </p>

      <p><b>(1) The Chemical Equilibria of Mineral Substances ~</b> </p>
      <p>The various elements may, by combination, give birth to bodies
        of an increasing complexity, from the minerals composing our
        globe up to the compounds forming the tissues of living beings.
      </p>
      <p>For a long time chemistry has been studying these combinations.
        It might therefore be supposed that we are about to enter a very
        well-known field. A very short stay there will show that, on the
        contrary, it constitutes a world full of utterly unknown
        quarters. </p>
      <p>As the mineral world was the only one accessible to the early
        methods of chemistry, it was naturally its first object of
        study. This was comparatively easy, and for this reason
        chemistry seemed at first a simple and precise science. </p>
      <p>Mineral substances are, in fact, generally formed by
        combinations of a very small number of elements --- oxygen,
        hydrogen, sulfur, etc. These combinations possess a constant
        composition and represent molecular edifices of small complexity
        in structure. It is only when we reach the compounds elaborated
        within the tissues of living beings that the phenomena become
        difficult to interpret. The molecular edifices then possess an
        excessive complication and a very great instability necessitated
        by the rapid production of energy requisite for the maintenance
        of life. The elementary edifice of the mineral world, composed
        of only a few stones, has becomes a town. The structure of
        organic substances sometimes reaches such a degree of
        complication that it very often escapes us altogether. </p>
      <p>But however simple mineral edifices may appear, we are far from
        discerning the nature of the equilibria capable of giving them
        birth. It is solely the effects produced by these equilibria
        which are accessible to us. It is impossible for us to know
        wherein an atom of sulfur differs from an atom of oxygen or from
        any other form, and equally impossible to understand the cause
        of the different properties in the compounds formed by their
        combinations. All that can be said is, that the relative
        position of the atoms seems to determine the properties of
        bodies much more than the attributes supposed to be inherent in
        these atoms. There are hardly any properties of elements which
        one cannot manage to transform by modifying the structure of the
        molecular edifices in which they are united. What properties of
        the rigid diamond are found in the gaseous carbonic acid
        resulting from the combination of the diamond with oxygen? What
        properties of the suffocating chlorine, of the alterable sodium
        are met with in the sea salt formed by their association?
        Cacodyl and arsenic are very poisonous bodies, potassium a very
        caustic one; while potassium cacodylate of potassium, which
        contains 42% arsenic, is a body in no wise caustic and utterly
        inoffensive. </p>
      <p>The properties of the elements then are capable of being
        entirely transformed by changes in the position of the atoms
        which enter into their structure. In chemistry, as in
        architecture, the shape of the edifice has a far greater
        importance than that of the materials which compose it. </p>
      <p>It is principally the isomeric bodies --- bodies possessing the
        same percentage of component parts though manifesting different
        properties, that is shown the importance of the structure of
        molecular edifices. In the isomeric bodies termed metameric
        there is not only the same proportional composition, but often
        the same number of atoms per molecule. The identity appears
        complete, but the difference in properties show that it cannot
        be so. </p>
      <p>In bodies termed polymeric the percentage composition likewise
        remains identical, but the molecular weight varies by the
        condensation or by the splitting in two of the molecules. Such
        at least is the explanation given. If we could create polymeric
        elements from the metals we know we should probably succeed in
        creating new bodies, just as, by polymerizing acetylene by
        simply heating it, we transform it into benzene. </p>
      <p>So long as chemistry had to handle only the very simple
        compounds of the mineral world ---- water, acids, salts, etc.,
        of which the composition was well known --- it succeeded, by
        methodically varying their composition, in transforming their
        properties and in creating new bodies at will. </p>
      <p>Take, for instance, as a combination with very little
        complication, the case of marsh gas or methane, which is
        composed of carbon and hydrogen (CH<sub>4</sub>). One can, by
        successively replacing an atom of hydrogen by an atom of
        chlorine, obtain very different products, such as mono-, bi-,
        tri-chlorinated (chloroform), or tetra-chloro-carbon (carbon
        tetrachloride). </p>
      <p>All of these reactions, being very simple, can be expressed by
        very simple formulas. Had chemistry stopped at this phase, it
        might have been considered as a perfectly constituted science.
        The study of the chemical equilibria of organic substances has
        shown the insufficiency of the early notions. </p>
      <p><b>(2) The Chemical Equilibria of Organic Substance ~</b> </p>
      <p>As soon as chemistry passed the bounds of the mineral world and
        penetrated into the study of the organic world, its phenomena
        became more and more complex. It was quickly noted that there
        existed equilibria independent of the percentage composition of
        bodies, and that consequently the customary formulas could not
        express them without giving the same formulas to very dissimilar
        bodies. It was necessary, therefore, to discard the early
        methods and to have recourse to geometrical figures, in order to
        approximately represent the structures coming to light. It was
        at first supposed --- against all likelihood --- that atoms
        ranged themselves on one plane according to geometrical lines,
        of which the hexagon was the type. Then it was at length
        understood that they were perforce disposed according to the
        three dimensions of space, and they then came to be represented
        by solid figure typified by the tetrahedron. Thus was born
        stereo-chemistry, which, without certainly telling us anything
        of the inaccessible architecture of atoms, permitted certain
        known facts to be put together and others to be discovered. But
        these diagrammatic structures, without any relationship to
        reality, in the long run showed themselves very insufficient. We
        were then led to suppose that the elements of bodies were not in
        static but in dynamic equilibrium. From this came a new
        chemistry, still in course of formation, which might be called
        kinematic chemistry. In its formulas atoms are represented by
        little circles, round which are drawn arrows indicating the
        supposed direction of their rotation. The idea that atoms and
        their component elements are in perpetual motion in bodies is
        quite in conformity with the notions I have set forth, but to
        interpret by diagram such complicated movements is evidently
        beyond our powers. </p>
      <p>The most striking feature in the current conception is that
        chemical compounds appear more and more as mobile equilibria,
        varying with the external conditions such as temperature and
        pressure, to which they are subjected. </p>
      <p>The reactions indicated by chemical equations owe their
        apparent rigidity only to the fact that the medium in which they
        are realized does not noticeably vary. When these conditions are
        much modified, the reactions immediately change and the usual
        equations are no longer applicable. What is called in chemistry
        the phase law was established through this fact being noticed.
        Any chemical combination ought always to be regarded as a state
        of equilibrium between the external forces which surround a body
        and the interior forces which it contains. </p>
      <p>So long as chemistry had only to study very simple mineral or
        organic compounds elementary laws were sufficient, but closer
        examination showed that substances existed to which none of the
        known laws of chemistry could be applied, and these substances
        are just those which playa preponderating part in the phenomena
        of life. A living being is made up of an aggregate of chemical
        compounds formed by the combination of a small number of
        elements so associated as to compose molecular edifices of very
        great mobility. This mobility, necessary for the rapid
        production of a great quantity of energy, is one of the very
        conditions of existence. Life is bound up in the constant
        construction and destruction of very complicated and very
        unstable molecular edifices. Death, on the contrary, is
        characterized by the return to less complicated molecular
        edifices of very great stability of equilibrium. </p>
      <p>A great number of chemical compounds of which the aggregate
        constitutes a living being, possess a structure and properties
        to which none of the old laws of chemistry are applicable. In
        this structure is sound a whole series of bodies --- diastases,
        toxins, anti-toxins, alexins, etc., of which the existence has
        only, in most cases, been revealed by physiological
        characteristics. No formula can express their composition, and
        no theory explains their properties. On them depend the majority
        of the phenomena of life, and they possess the mysterious
        quality of producing very great effects without any apparent
        change in their composition and simply by their presence. </p>
      <p>It is thus that the protoplasm which is the fundamental
        substance of the cells, never appears to change, although by its
        presence it determines the most complicated chemical reactions,
        notably those which result in the transformation of bodies
        containing energy at low potential into bodies whose potential
        is higher. The plant is able to manufacture, with compounds of
        small complication, such as water and carbonic acid, very
        complicated oxidizable molecular edifices, which are charged
        with energy. From the energy at low tension which surrounds it,
        it consequently manufactures energy at a high tension. It
        compresses the spring which other beings will relax to utilize
        its force. </p>
      <p>The chemical edifices, which humble cells are able to form,
        comprise operations, not only the most skillful in our
        laboratories --- namely, etherification, oxidation, reduction,
        polymerization, etc., but many more skillful still which we are
        unable to imitate. By means which we do not even suspect, the
        vital cells are able to construct those complicated and varied
        compounds --- albuminoids, cellulose, fats, starch, etc.,
        necessary for the support of life. They are able to decompose
        the most stable bodies, such as sodium chloride, to extract the
        nitrogen from ammoniacal salts, the phosphorus from phosphates,
        etc. </p>
      <p>All these operations, so precise, so admirably adapted to one
        purpose, are directed by forces of which we have no conception,
        which act exactly as if they possessed a power of clairvoyance
        very superior to reason. What they accomplish every moment of
        our existence is far above what can be realized by the most
        advanced science. </p>
      <p>A living being is an aggregate of cellular lives. So long as we
        are unable to comprehend the phenomena which take place in the
        bosom of an isolated cell, and have not discovered the forces
        which direct them, it will be of no use to build philosophical
        systems to explain life. Chemistry has, at least, achieved this
        much progress that it puts us face to face with a world of
        totally unknown reactions. For the former certainties of a too
        young science, it has finally substituted the uncertainties with
        which a more advanced science is ever burdened. They should not,
        however, be made too prominent, for the length of the journey
        before us would paralyze all efforts. Happily, those who enter
        upon these studies do not see how little advanced they are, and
        very often their teachers do not see it either. There is no
        dearth of learned formulas to conceal our ignorance. </p>
      <p>What part may intra-atomic energy play in the reactions as yet
        so little known to us, which take place in the bosom of the
        cells? This is the point into which we will now inquire. </p>

              Equilibria of Matter</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p><b>(1) Intra-Atomic Chemistry ~</b> </p>
      <p>I have just briefly demonstrated the existence of chemical
        actions which reveal certain equilibria of matter hitherto
        completely unknown. Without claiming to be able to determine the
        nature of these equilibria, will it not now be possible to more
        or less foreshadow their origin? It seems extremely probable
        that a large number of the inexplicable reactions we have
        mentioned, instead of only affecting molecular edifices, affect
        atomic edifices also, and bring into play the important forces
        of which we have proved the existence within them. Ordinary
        chemistry can displace the materials of which compounds are
        formed, but has not hitherto thought of dealing with these
        materials which it has considered to be indestructible. </p>
      <p>Whatever interpretation may be given to the facts to follow, it
        is certain that they prove the existence of equilibria of matter
        which none of the early theories of chemistry could explain. We
        see in them important actions produced by reactions so slight
        that our balances cannot detect them, and phenomena which none
        of the doctrines of chemistry have foreseen, and which for the
        most part contradict them. We are on the threshold of a new
        science where our ordinary reagents and balances can be no help,
        since it is a question of reactions whose effects are enormous,
        notwithstanding that but infinitely small quantities of matter
        are brought into play. </p>
      <p>The fundamental phenomena which reveal the dissociation of
        matter having been referred to elsewhere, it would be useless to
        go into the subject anew. The facts I am about to enumerate
        prove, in my opinion, that this dissociation has an important
        bearing on many phenomena hitherto unexplained. </p>
      <p>These facts cannot be classed in any methodical fashion, since
        we have to do with a science yet unborn. I shall therefore
        confine myself to describing them in a series of paragraphs,
        without endeavoring to present them in the orderly manner which
        their fragmentary character does not allow. </p>
      <p><b>(2) Colloid Metals ~</b> </p>
      <p>One of the best types of substances which elude the ordinary
        laws of chemistry is represented by the colloid metals. One of
        the methods of preparing them should alone suffice to indicate,
        apart from their very special properties, that their atoms must
        be partly dissociated. We have seen that, from the metallic
        poles of a static machine in motion there issue, as the result
        of the dissociation of matter, electrons and ions. Instead of a
        static machine let us take for the convenience of the
        experiment, an induction coil, the poles of which terminate in
        rods of the metal we wish to dissociate --- gold or platinum for
        instance --- which are plunged in distilled water. By making
        sparks pass between the two rods, as described by Bredig, a
        cloud will be seen to form round the electrodes/ After a certain
        time, the liquid becomes colored and contains, in addition to
        the metallic torn from the electrodes and proceeding from the
        dissociation of the metal. It is to this unknown thing that the
        name of colloid metal has been given. If the operation be long
        continued the colloid ceases to form, as if the liquid were
        saturated. </p>
      <p>The properties of metals in a colloidal state are absolutely
        different from those of the body from which they emanate. In the
        prodigiously small proportion of 1/300 mg/liter, the colloid
        metal exercises a very energetic action which we will
        demonstrate later on. </p>
      <p>The liquid in which the colloid metal is found is colored, but
        it is impossible to separate anything from it impossible to
        separate anything fro it by filtration, or to perceive in it
        with the microscope any particles, if they exist, are inferior
        in size to the wavelengths of light. </p>
      <p>The ionic theory being applicable to most phenomena, it has
        naturally been applied to the colloids. A colloidal solution is
        today considered as containing granules bearing electric charges
        --- some positive, the others negative. But whatever this rather
        too simple doctrine be worth, it is evident that a colloid metal
        has retained no traces of the same metal in the ordinary state.
        Its atoms have probably undergone a commencement of
        dissociation, and it is for this very reason that they no longer
        possess any of their former properties. Colloidal platinum or
        gold are certainly no longer either gold or platinum, though
        made from these metals. </p>
      <p>The properties of colloid metals have, in fact, no analogy with
        those of a salt of the same metal in solution. By certain of
        their actions they resemble far more some organic compounds,
        notably the oxidases, than mineral salts. They present the
        greatest analogies with the toxins and the ferments, whence the
        name of inorganic ferments sometimes applied to them. Colloidal
        platinum decomposes oxygenated water as do certain ferments of
        the blood; it transforms alcohol by oxidation into acetic acid
        in the same way as does the mycodermina aceti. Colloidal iridium
        decomposes formiate of lime into calcium carbonate, carbonic
        acid, and hydrogen after the manner of certain bacteria. More
        curious still, bodies, which like prussic acid, iodine, etc.,
        poison organic ferments, paralyze or destroy in the same manner
        the action of colloid metals. </p>
      <p>The properties, at once at special and so energetic, of these
        metals led perforce to the study of their action on the
        organism, which is very intense. It is to their presence in
        various mineral waters that Prof. Garrigou attributes several
        properties of these waters --- that of abolishing the phenomena
        of intoxication, for example. M. Robin has employed colloid
        metals as a remedy for sundry affections, notably typhoid fever
        and pneumonia, by injection. By injecting from 5 to 10 cubic
        milligrams of metal per liter. The result was a considerable
        increase of the organic exchanges, and of the oxidation of the
        elimination products as revealed by an over-production of urea
        and uric acid. These solutions being, unfortunately, very
        rapidly alterable, their practical use is very difficult. </p>
      <p>There is, it will be seen, no relationship, close or distant,
        between the colloid metals and those from which they are
        derived. No chemical reaction can explain the properties they
        possess. Their mode of preparation authorizes the supposition
        that they contain, as I have said, certain elements of
        dissociated matter. I have, however, not observed in them any
        phenomena of radioactivity, but it will be readily understood
        that if these phenomena arise during the dissociation of matter,
        there is no reason for their appearance when matter is already
        dissociated. </p>
      <p>Besides metals, many substances can exist in the state termed
        colloidal, and there is now a tendency to ascribe to this
        unknown form of the material equilibria a preponderant part in
        physiology. Protoplasm, for instance, would thus be only a
        mixture of colloidal substances --- a fact, however, which
        throws very little light on its marvelous properties. </p>
      <p><b>(3) The Diastases, The Enzymes, the Toxins, and Actions by
          Presence ~</b> </p>
      <p>To the colloidal metals obtained by the dissociation of various
        simple bodies must be compared the compounds classed under the
        name of diastases, toxins, enzymes, etc., whose reactions are
        near akin to those of the colloidal metals. Their chemical
        constitution is utterly unknown. They act almost exclusively by
        their presence and are sometimes extremely poisonous in almost
        imponderable doses.&nbsp; According to Armand Gauthier, two
        drops of the toxin of tetanus containing 99% of water, and 1%
        only of the active substance --- which would hardly represent a
        milligram --- is sufficient to kill a horse. A gram of this
        substance would suffice, he says, to kill 75,000 men. Such
        energies as these make one think of those which very slight
        atomic dissociations might manifest. </p>
      <p>At the time when bacteria were believed to constitute the
        active agent of intoxications, it was possible to explain by
        their rapid multiplication the intensity observed in their
        effects, but it is now known that the toxins remain just as
        active after the bacteria have been separated by filtration. The
        living substance called yeast transforms glucose into alcohol
        and carbonic acid, but after having killed this yeast by heating
        it to a certain temperature, a substance can be extracted from
        it deprived of all organisms and called zymase, as capable of
        producing fermentation as the living yeast itself. The phenomena
        attributed a few years ago to microorganisms are therefore due
        to non-living chemical substances fabricated by them. </p>
      <p>The part played by the various substances just mentioned in the
        phenomena of life is a very preponderant one. Most often it is
        only physiological reactions which reveal their existence and
        allow them to be isolated. All we know of them is that they lose
        their properties if deprived of the infinitely small quantities
        of mineral matters that they contain under a form that we
        suppose to border on the colloidal state. </p>
      <p>Most of the above bodies --- colloid metals, diastases,
        ferments, etc. --- possess the property. Very inexplicable as
        yet, of acting, at least in appearance, by their presence alone.
        They do not appear in the products of the reactions which they
        excite. These actions of presence, also called catalytic, have
        been observed for a long time in chemistry. It was known, for
        example, that oxygen and sulfurous acid, though without action
        on one another, unite to form sulfuric acid in the presence of
        platinum black without the latter taking part in the reaction.
        So nitrate of ammonia, though ordinarily unalterable, also gives
        a continual disengagement of nitrogen in the presence of
        platinum black. This latter body does not combine with oxygen,
        but it can absorb 800 times its own volume of it. It is supposed
        --- but this is evidently only a hypothesis --- that it
        generally acts by borrowing oxygen from the air and conveying it
        to the substances with which it is in contact. </p>
      <p>Among the substances of which one might strictly say that they
        act only by their presence is found the vapor of water, which in
        extremely small doses plays an important part in various
        reactions. Perfectly dry acetylene is without action on
        potassium hydride, but in the presence of a trace of humidity
        the two bodies react one on the other with such violence that
        the mixture becomes incandescent. Well-dried carbonic acid also
        is without action on potassium hydride, but in the presence of a
        slight quantity of steam it produces a formiate. It is the same
        with many other bodies --- ammoniacal gas and hydrochloric gas,
        for example, which ordinarily combine with the emission of thick
        white fumes, but no longer do so after having been carefully
        dried. It will be remembered that I noted that by adding to
        dried salts of quinine traces of water vapor they become
        phosphorescent and radioactive. </p>
      <p>Although catalytic actions were early known, it is only in the
        last few years that they have been proved to play a preponderant
        part in the chemistry of living beings. It is now admitted that
        the diastases and various ferments whose role is so important
        act only by their presence. </p>
      <p>On closely examining the role of bodies acting by their mere
        presence, we note that they behave as if energy were transported
        from the catalyzing body to that catalyzed. This fact can hardly
        be explained, in my idea, unless by the catalyzing body
        undergoing the commencement of atomic dissociation. We know
        that, by reason of the enormous velocity possessed by particles
        of matter during its dissociation, considerable quantities of
        energy can be produced by the dissociation of a quantity of
        matter so imponderable as to elude all attempts to weigh it. The
        catalyzing substances should therefore be simply liberators of
        energy. </p>
      <p>If this really be the case, we ought to be able to note that
        the catalyzing body at length undergoes a certain alteration.
        Now, this is exactly what is verified by observation. Platinum
        black and the colloid metals are in the long run worn out --- by
        use they lose a great part of their catalyzing action. </p>
      <p><b>(4) Oscillating Chemical Equilibria ~</b> </p>
      <p>All the reactions above indicated are, I repeat, inexplicable
        by current ideas. They are even contrary to the most important
        laws of chemistry, such as those of definite and of multiple
        proportions. We see, in fact, some bodies transform themselves
        under the influence of imponderable doses of certain substances,
        while others excite intense reactions by their mere presence,
        etc. </p>
      <p>The study of early chemistry left on the mind the notion of
        very stable products, of well-defined and constant composition,
        and incapable of modification except by violent means such as
        high temperatures. Later on arose the notion of compounds less
        fixed, capable of receiving a whole series of modifications
        connected with the variations of the medium or of the
        temperature and of the pressure to which they are subjected. Of
        late years the notion has gradually arisen that any body
        whatever simply represents a state of equilibrium between the
        internal elements of which it is formed and the external
        elements acting upon it. If this connection is not plainly
        apparent in some bodies, it is because they are so constituted
        that their equilibria maintain themselves without perceptible
        changes within the limits of fairly large variations of the
        medium. Water can remain liquid in variations of temperature
        ranging from O° C to 100° C, and most metals do not appear to
        change their state within still wider limits. </p>
      <p>It is now necessary to proceed farther and admit that outside
        the only factors till now regarded by chemistry --- mass,
        pressure, and temperature --- there are others in which occur
        the elements resulting from the dissociation of atoms. These
        elements should be capable of giving to bodies equilibria of
        such mobility that these equilibria could be destroyed or
        regenerated in a very short time under very slight external
        influences. </p>
      <p>This succession of changes would be accompanied by the
        liberation of a certain quantity of the intra-atomic energy
        contained in matter. The actions by mere presence which are of
        such importance in the phenomena of life, may perhaps find an
        explanation in this theory. It was my studies of phosphorescence
        which led me to this hypothesis. It will be recollected that
        pure substances, various sulfides, phosphates of lime, etc., are
        never phosphorescent normally, and only become so when brought
        to a red heat for a length of time with traces of other various
        bodies --- such as bismuth, manganese, copper, etc. I have
        shown, on the other hand, that this elevation of temperature
        always provokes a dissociation of matter. It is therefore
        permissible to suppose that the elements proceeding from this
        dissociation have an active part in the unknown compounds then
        formed, which gives to such bodies the capacity for
        phosphorescence. </p>
      <p>The combinations thus obtained have precisely the
        characteristic pointed out above as belonging to extreme
        mobility --- of destroying and regenerating themselves very
        rapidly. A ray of blue light falling on a screen of zinc
        sulfide, illuminating it in the tenth of a second, and a ray of
        red light falling on the same screen, destroys the
        phosphorescence in the same space of time --- it brings the
        screen back to its primitive state. These two contrary
        operations, necessarily implying two converse reactions, may be
        indefinitely repeated. </p>
      <p>However this may be, the facts enumerated in this chapter show
        us that chemistry is on the threshold of entirely new phenomena,
        characterized very probably by intra-atomic reactions
        accompanied by a liberation of energy. By reason of the enormous
        quantity of intra-atomic energy contained in matter, a loss of
        substance too small to be detected by our balances may be
        accompanied by a very great liberation of energy. </p>
      <p>In endeavoring to bring the phenomenon of the dissociation of
        atoms into the explanation of unexplained chemical reactions, I
        have evidently only framed a hypothesis whose justification is
        not yet strong enough. It has at least the advantage of
        explaining facts hitherto without interpretation. It is certain
        that a phenomenon so important and frequent as that of the
        dissociation of matter must play a predominant part in many
        reactions. Intra-atomic energy is a science of which we barely
        see only the dawn. In this new science the old material of
        chemists, their balances and their reagents, will probably find
        their occupation gone. </p>

      </center>
      <p><b>(1) Genesis and Evolution of Atoms ~</b> </p>
      <p>Barely 40 years ago it would have been impossible to write, on
        the subject I am now treating, a single line deduced from a
        scientific observation, and one might have thought that thick
        darkness would always envelop the history of the origin and
        development of atoms. How could they, moreover, be supposed to
        evolve? Was it not universally admitted that they were
        indestructible? Everything in the world changed and was
        ephemeral. Beings succeeded beings by assuming always new forms;
        stars were finally extinguished; but the atom alone did not
        submit to the action of time, and seemed eternal. The doctrine
        of its immutability reigned for 2000 years, and nothing allowed
        us to suppose that it might one day be shaken. </p>
      <p>We have run through the experiments which have at last ruined
        this old belief. We now know that matter vanishes slowly, and
        consequently is not destined to last forever. But if the atoms
        are likewise condemned to a relatively ephemeral existence, it
        is natural to suppose they were not always what they are at the
        present day, and that they must have evolved during the
        succession of the ages. Through what successive phases have they
        passed? What forms have they step by step assumed? What were
        formerly the different substances we see around us --- stone,
        lead, iron, in a word, all bodies? Astronomy alone could give
        some answer to such questions. Able to penetrate by spectrum
        analysis into the structure of the stars of various ages which
        illumine our nights, it has revealed to us the transformations
        to which matter is subject when it commences to grow old. We
        know that the spectrum analysis proves an incandescent body to
        have a spectrum reaching further towards the ultraviolet as its
        temperature rises. The same spectrum, moreover, has a maximum
        brilliancy which likewise moves towards the ultraviolet when the
        temperature of the luminous source rises, and towards the red
        when it diminishes. We know, on the other hand, that the
        spectral rays of a metal vary with its temperature. Watteville
        has even shown that if potassium be introduced into a flame, its
        spectrum changes according as the metal is in the more or less
        heated regions of this flame. The spectroscope gives us, then,
        the means of knowing from what elements the stars are composed,
        and how they vary with the temperature. In this manner it has
        been possible to follow their evolution. </p>
      <p>The nebulae which show only the spectra of permanent gases like
        hydrogen, or products derived from carbon, must constitute,
        according to several astronomers, the first phase of the
        evolution of celestial bodies. By condensing they must form new
        stages of matter which end in the formation of stars. These
        latter represent very varying periods of evolution. </p>
      <p>The whitest stars, which are also the hottest, as is proved by
        the prolongation of their spectrum into the ultraviolet, are
        composed of only a very small number of chemical elements.
        Sirius and alpha-Lyrae, for instance, contain almost exclusively
        incandescent hydrogen. In the red and yellow stars, stars less
        heated, which are beginning to cool and are therefore of great
        age, other chemical elements appear. First, magnesium, calcium,
        silicon, etc. Certain bodies are observed only in the coldest
        stars. It is therefore with the lowering of temperature that the
        elements of atoms undergo new phases of evolution, the result of
        which is the formation of certain simple bodies. </p>
      <p>It is probable that the solid elements we observe --- gold,
        silver, platinum, etc. --- are bodies which have lost different
        quantities of their intra-atomic energy. Simple bodies in a
        gaseous state --- nitrogen, hydrogen, oxygen --- are the least
        numerous on our globe. To pass into a solid state, which they
        can only do at an extremely low temperature, they must first
        lose a very great amount of energy. </p>
      <p>It seems very doubtful if heat is the sole cause of the
        sidereal evolution of the atoms. Other forces most probably have
        acted in it. We know that variations in pressure may, as
        Deslandres has shown, cause considerable variations in the rays
        of the spectrum; "under increasing pressures new series are seen
        to arise which only existed in germ at lower pressures". </p>
      <p>To sum up, the observation of the stars shows us the evolution
        of the atoms and the formation of the various simple bodies
        under the influence of this evolution. </p>
      <p>We are ignorant of the nature and the mode of action of the
        forces capable of condensing a part of the ether which fills the
        universe into atoms of gas, such as hydrogen or helium, and then
        of transforming this gas into substances such as sodium, lead,
        or gold. But the changes observed in the stars are a proof that
        forces capable of effecting such transformations exist, that
        they have acted in the past, and that they continue to act in
        the present. </p>
      <p>In the system of the world unfolded by Laplace, the sun and the
        planets were at first a great nebula, in the center of which was
        formed a nucleus animated by a rotary motion from which were
        successively detached rings which later on formed the earth and
        the other planets. Gaseous at first, these masses progressively
        cooled, and the space at first filled by the nebula was no
        longer occupied save by a small number of globes revolving on
        their own axes and round the sun. It is allowable to suppose
        that the atoms were not formed otherwise. We have seen that each
        of them may be considered as a little solar system comprising
        one or several central parts, round which revolve at immense
        speed thousands of particles. It is from the union of these
        miniature solar systems that matter is composed. </p>
      <p>Our nebula, like all those still shining by night, must
        perforce have come from something. In the present state of
        science there is only, as far as we can see, the ether which can
        have constituted this cosmic starting point; and this is why all
        investigations always bring us back to consider it as the
        fundamental element of the universe. Worlds are born there and
        return thither to die. </p>
      <p>We cannot say how the atom was constituted nor why it at length
        slowly vanishes, but at least we know that an evolution similar
        to this process pursues its way without halt, since we observe
        worlds in every phase of evolution from the nebula to the cooled
        planet, starting from suns still incandescent like our own. The
        transformations of the inorganic world now appear as certain as
        those of organized beings. The atoms, and consequently matter,
        do not escape that sovereign law which causes the beings which
        surround us and the innumerable stars with which the firmament
        is peopled, to be born, to grow, and to die. </p>
      <p><b>(2) The End of Matter ~</b> </p>
      <p>I have attempted in this work to determine the nature of the
        products of the dematerialization of matter, and to show that
        they constitute by their properties substances intermediate
        between matter and the ether. </p>
      <p>The ultimate term of the dematerialization of matter seems to
        be the ether in the bosom of which it is plunged. How does it
        return to it? What forms of equilibrium does it assume to affect
        this return? Here we are evidently on the extreme limit of the
        things our intelligence can comprehend, and are inevitably
        compelled to form hypotheses, but they will not be in vain if it
        be possible to give them precise facts and analogies for a
        support. </p>
      <p>When studying the origin of electricity we saw that it might be
        regarded as one of the most f=general forms of the
        dematerialization of matter. We recognized, moreover, tha the
        final products of the dissociation of the radioactive bodies
        were formed of atoms of electricity. These last should therefore
        represent one of the last phases of the existence of material
        substances. </p>
      <p>What is the fate of the atom of electricity after the
        dissociation of matter? Is it eternal while matter is not? If it
        possesses any individuality, how long does it keep it? And if it
        does not keep it, what becomes of the atom? </p>
      <p>That the electric atom should be destined to have no end is
        very unlikely. It is on the extreme limit of things. If the
        existence of those elements had continued to exist, since their
        formation, under the influence of the various causes which
        produce the slow dissociation of matter, they would finally have
        accumulated to the extent of forming a new universe, or, at
        least, a kind of nebula. It is therefore likely that they at
        last lose their individual existence. But in what way, then, do
        they disappear? Are we to suppose that their destiny is that of
        those blocks of ice which float in the Polar regions, and which
        preserve an individual existence so long as the sole cause of
        destruction which can annihilate them --- a rise in temperature
        --- does not attack them? So soon as they are overtaken by this
        cause of destruction, they vanish into the ocean and disappear.
        Such, doubtless, is the final lot of the electric atom. Once it
        has radiated away all its energy, it vanishes into the ether and
        is no more. </p>
      <p>Experiment furnishes a certain support to this hypothesis. I
        demonstrated with regard to the elements of dissociated matter
        emitted by the machines in our laboratories, that electric atoms
        in motion are always accompanied by vibrations of the ether.
        Such vibrations have received the names of Hertzian waves,
        radiant heat, visible light, ultraviolet light, etc., according
        to the effect on our senses or on our instruments, but we know
        tha their nature is the same. They may be compared to the waves
        of the ocean, which differ only by their size. </p>
      <p>These vibrations of the ether, ever the companions of the
        electric atoms, most likely represent the form under which these
        vanish by the radiation of all their energy. He electric
        particle with an individuality of its own, of a defined and
        constant magnitude, would thus constitute the last stage but one
        of the disappearance of matter. The last of all would be
        represented by the vibrations of the ether, vibrations which
        possess no more durable individuality than do the waves formed
        in water when a stone is thrown into it, and which soon
        disappear. </p>
      <p>How can the electric atoms proceeding from the
        dematerialization of matter preserve their individuality and
        transform themselves in vibrations of the ether? </p>
      <p>All modern research leads is to consider these particles as
        constituted by whirls, analogous to gyroscopes, formed in the
        bosom of ether and connected with it by their lines of force.
        The question, therefore, reduces itself to this: how can a
        vortex formed in a fluid disappear into this fluid by causing
        vibrations in it? </p>
      <p>Stated in this form, the solution of the problem presents no
        serious difficulties. It can be easily seen, in fact, how a
        vortex generated at the expense of a liquid can, when its
        equilibrium is disturbed, vanish by radiating away the energy it
        contains under the forms of vibration of the medium in which it
        is plunged. In this way, for example, a waterspout formed by a
        whirl of liquid loses its individuality and disappears in the
        ocean. </p>
      <p>It is, no doubt, the same with the vibrations of the ether.
        They represent the last stage of the dematerialization of
        matter, the one preceding its final disappearance. After these
        ephemeral vibrations the ether returns to its repose, and matter
        has definitely disappeared. It has returned to the primitive
        ether from which hundreds of millions of ages and forces unknown
        to us can alone cause it to emerge, as it has emerged in the
        far-off ages when the first traces of our universe were outlined
        on the chaos. The beginning of things was, doubtless, nothing
        else than a re-beginning. Nothing leads to the belief that they
        had a real beginning, or that they can have an end. </p>
      <p>If the views set forth in this work be correct, matter must
        have successively passed through very different stages of
        existence. </p>
      <p>The first of these carries us back to the very origin of the
        worlds, and escapes all the data of experiment. It is the chaos
        epoch of ancient legends. What was to be one the universe was
        then only constituted of shapeless clouds of ether. </p>
      <p>By becoming polarized and condensed under the influences of
        forces unknown to us, which acted through age piled on age, this
        ether was finally organized in the form of atoms, and it is from
        the aggregation of these last that matter as it exists in our
        globe or as we can observe it in the stars at various stages of
        their evolution, is composed. </p>
      <p>During this period of progressive formation, the atoms have
        stored up the provision of energy they have to expend in various
        forms --- heat, electricity, etc.--- in the course of time.
        While thenceforth slowly losing the energy first stored up by
        them, they have undergone various evolutions and have
        consequently assumed varying aspects. Once they have radiated
        away all their store of energy in the form of luminous, caloric,
        or other vibrations, they return by the very fact of these
        consecutive radiations, to their dissociation--- to the
        primitive ether whence they came. This last, therefore,
        represents the final nirvana to which all things return after a
        more or less ephemeral existence. </p>
      <p>The evolution of the worlds would, therefore, in the last
        analysis, comprise two very different phases --- one the
        condensation of energy into the atom, the other, the expending
        of this energy. </p>
      <p>These brief sketches on the beginning of our universe and on
        its end evidently constitute only faint gleams projected into
        the deep darkness which envelopes our past and veils our future.
        They are doubtless very insufficient explanations, but science
        can as yet offer no others. It has not yet any glimpse of the
        time when it may discover the true first cause of things nor
        even arrive at the real causes of a single phenomenon. It must
        therefore leave to religions and to philosophies the care of
        imagining systems capable of satisfying our longing to know. All
        these systems represent the synthesis of our ignorance and of
        our hopes, and are consequently only pure illusions; but these
        creations of our dreams have always been more seductive than
        realities, for which reason man has never ceased to choose them
        as guides. </p>
      <p><b>(3) Conclusions ~</b> </p>
      <p>The experiments analyzed in this work have allowed us to follow
        the atom from its birth to its decline. We have seen that
        matter, hitherto considered as indestructible, slowly vanishes
        through the dissociation of its component elements. This matter,
        formerly regarded as inert and as having only the power of
        giving back the energy which had been communicated to it, has,
        on the contrary, shown itself to us as an immense reservoir of
        forces. And from these forces are derived the majority of known
        modes of energy; molecular attractions, solar heat, and
        electricity in particular. </p>
      <p>We have seen that matter can be dissociated under the influence
        of manifold causes, and that the products of its successive
        dematerializations constitute substances intermediate by their
        properties between matter and the ether. The result of this is
        that the ancient dichotomy between the world of the ponderable
        and that of the imponderable, formerly so widely separated, must
        disappear. And the study of the successive phases of the
        existence of matter has led us to the conclusion that the final
        term of its evolution is the return into the ether. </p>
      <p>In thus endeavoring to catch a glimpse of the origins of
        matter, of its evolution and of its end, we have step by step
        arrived at the extreme limits of those semi-certitudes to which
        science can attain, and beyond which there is nothing but the
        darkness of the unknown. </p>
      <p>My work is therefore finished. It represents the synthesis of
        laborious investigations carried on during many years. Starting
        with the attentive observation of the effects produced by light
        on a fragment of metal, I have been successively led by the
        concatenation of phenomena to explore very different fields of
        physics and to sketch in outline a synthesis of the universe. </p>
      <p>Without doubt, experiment has always been my principal guide,
        but to interpret the results obtained and to discover others, I
        have had to set up more than one hypothesis. As soon as the
        obscure regions of science are entered, it is impossible to
        proceed otherwise. If you refuse to take hypothesis as a guide
        you must resign yourself to chance for your teacher. "The role
        of the hypothesis", says Poincare, "is one which no
        mathematician can afford to ignore, any more than can an
        experimentalist". To make hypotheses, to verify them by
        experiments, then to attempt to connect, by the aid of
        generalizations, the facts discovered, represents the stages
        necessary for the building up of all our knowledge. </p>
      <p>In no other way have the great edifices of science been
        constructed. Imposing as they are, they still contain a large
        number of unverified theories, and it is often the least
        verifiable which play the greatest p[art in the direction of the
        researches of every epoch. </p>
      <p>It is rightly said that science is the daughter of experiment,
        but it is very rare that experiment has not hypothesis for its
        guide. This last is the magic wand which evokes the known from
        the unknown, the real from the unreal, and gives a body to the
        most shadowy chimeras. From the heroic ages down to modern
        times, hypothesis has always been one of the mainsprings of the
        man’s activity. It is by religious hypotheses that the most
        imposing civilizations have been founded, and it is with
        scientific hypotheses that the greatest modern discoveries have
        been accomplished. Modern science accepts them no less than did
        our forefathers --- and their role is, in reality, much greater
        now than ever it was, and no science could progress without
        their aid. </p>
      <p>Hypotheses above all serve to found those sovereign dogmas
        which occupy, in science, as preponderant a part as in religions
        and philosophies. The learned just as much as the ignorant man,
        has need of faith to give direction to his researches and to
        guide his thoughts. He can create nothing if not animated by
        some faith, but must not remain too long unmoved in that faith.
        Dogmas become dangerous so soon as they commence to grow old. </p>
      <p>It matters little that hypotheses and the beliefs they generate
        be insufficient; it is enough that they are fruitful, and they
        become so as soon as they provoke research. Strictly verifiable
        hypotheses do not exist. Neither do absolutely positive laws.
        The most important of the principles on which all the sciences
        rely are only truths approximately true within certain limits,
        but which, outside those limits, lose all exactitude. </p>
      <p>Science lives on facts, but it has always been great
        generalizations which have given them birth. A fundamental
        theory cannot be modified without the direction of scientific
        researches at once changing. From the single fact that ideas on
        the constitution and invariability of atoms are in course of
        transformation, the doctrines which once formed a basis for the
        foundations of physics, of chemistry, and of mechanics, together
        with the direction of research, will have to change likewise.
        This new orientation in research will necessarily bring with it
        an outburst of new and unexpected facts. </p>
      <p>No one could dream of studying the world of atoms at the still
        recent time when they were thought to be formed of simple,
        irreducible, inaccessible, and indestructible elements. Today we
        know that science is able to attack these elements, and that
        each one of them is a small universe of an extraordinarily
        complicated structure, a repository of forces formerly unknown,
        the magnitude whereof exceeds enormously all those hitherto
        known. That which chemistry and physics believed they knew best
        was in reality what they knew least. </p>
      <p>It is in these atomic universes, whose nature was so long
        misunderstood, that must be sought the explanation of most of
        the mysteries which surround us. The atom, which is not eternal;
        as the ancient creeds asserted, is far more powerful than if it
        were indestructible and therefore incapable of change. It is no
        longer a thing inert, the blind sport of all the forces of the
        universe. It is the very soul of things. It stores up the
        energies which are the mainspring of the world and the beings
        which animate it. Notwithstanding its infinite minuteness, the
        atom perhaps contains all the secrets of the infinite greatness.

      <p>All the theories set out in the preceding pages rest on a long
        series of experiments. The scientific or philosophical doctrine
        which has not experience for its basis is deprived of interest
        and constitutes only a literary dissertation without meaning. </p>
      <p>In the following pages I can only give a brief summary of the
        experiments published by me during the last 10 years. The
        memoirs in which they are described take up about 400 columns of
        the <i>Revue Scientifique</i>, and I could not dream of
        republishing them here. Some of them, such as those on
        phosphorescence, Hertzian waves, the infrared, etc., I have had
        to omit entirely. </p>
      <p>In all that follows I have especially endeavored to give very
        simple experiments, and consequently easy to repeat. Naturally,
        I do not recapitulate those which have already been described,
        when this could be done without going into too many technical
        details in the first part. </p>
      <p>Much of the apparatus and a great part of the methods described
        in the following pages have no longer more than an historical
        interest. Both the one and the other have been brought
        considerably nearer to perfection by the physicists who have
        entered upon the path I marked out. There is always use,
        however, in knowing the apparatus employed at the outset of new
        researches, and for this reason I have described without
        alteration the instruments and methods which I have used. </p>

          <b><font size="+1">General Methods of Observation for
              Verifying the Dissociation of Matter</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>I have explained in a former chapter the principles of the
        methods employed in studying the dissociation of matter --- that
        is to say, its dematerialization. Before describing them in
        detail I will recall in a few lines what I have said. </p>
      <p>All the means employed for verifying the dissociation of a
        body, whether radium or any sort of metal, are identical. The
        characteristic phenomenon to be studied is always the emission
        of particles animated by an immense speed, deviable by a
        magnetic field, and capable of rendering the air a conductor of
        electricity. It is this last feature alone which was used to
        isolate radium. </p>
      <p>There are other accessory characteristics, such as photographic
        impressions and the production of phosphorescence and of
        fluorescence by the particles emitted, but they are of secondary
        importance. Besides, 99% of the emission from radium and the
        radioactive bodies is composed of particles without on the
        photographic plate, and there exist radioactive bodies, such as
        polonium, which only emit such radiations (1). </p>
      <p>[(1) No longer true.] </p>
      <p>The possibility of deviating these particles by a magnetic
        field constitutes the most important phenomenon next to the
        aptitude for rendering the air a conductor of electricity. It
        has enabled the identity between the particles emitted by
        radioactive bodies and the cathode rays of Crookes’ tube to be
        settled beyond dispute, and it is the degree of deviation of
        these particles by a magnetic field which has rendered the
        measurement of their speed possible. </p>
      <p>As the measurement of the magnetic deviation of radioactive
        particles requires very delicate and costly apparatus, it is
        impossible to include it among easily performed experiments.
        These last being the only ones I wish to give here, I shall
        confine myself to the fundamental property possessed by
        particles of dissociated matter of rendering the air a conductor
        of electricity. </p>
      <p><i>The Way to Prove that the Air has been Rendered a Conductor
          of Electricity by Radioactive Bodies</i> ~ </p>
      <p>The classic process employed to prove that a body emits
        particles of dissociated atoms capable of rendering the air a
        conductor of electricity is exceedingly simple. It requires, in
        fact, no other instrument than a graduated electroscope. The
        substance X, supposed to be capable of dissociation, is placed
        on a plate A (Figure 36). Above it is arranged a plate of metal
        B connected with a charged electroscope C. If conducting
        particles --- ions of electrons --- are emitted by the body X,
        the air becomes a conductor between the two plates and the
        electroscope is discharged. The rate of fall of the leaves is
        proportionate to the intensity of the emission of the particles
        by the dissociation. Or, the same results can be obtained by
        placing the bodies to be studied in a metal capsule placed
        directly on the electroscope. This is the means I generally
        employ. </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="fig36.jpg" height="205" width="221"></p>
      </center>
      It must not be thought that the electroscope constitutes a rough
      and ready mode of examination incapable of yielding exact
      measurements. Rutherford, who, has studied it at great length,
      shows, on the contrary, that it is a very exact instrument, far
      superior, for most experiments, to the quadrant electrometer, and
      when well-constructed much more sensitive than the best
      galvanometer. The capacity c of a system with gold-leaf 4 cm long
      is, according to him, about one electrostatic unit. If we call v
      the fall of potential of the leaves in seconds t, the intensity of
      the current I through the gas is given by the formula 1- cv / t.
      In this way a current of 2 x 10<sup>15</sup> amperes can be
      measured, which cannot be done with any galvanometer. But, for
      ordinary experiments, such a degree of sensitiveness is absolutely
      useless, and in the majority of cases it suffices to use an
      electroscope surmounted by a plate above or on which, as the case
      may be, the matter to be experimented on is placed. It is only
      necessary, though this point is indispensable, that the dielectric
      through which the rod supporting the gold leaves passes, should be
      a perfect insulator.
      <p>This last and very essential condition is, unfortunately, not
        realizable in any of the electroscopes manufactured in Paris.
        Only those of which the insulator is made with pure sulfur or
        amber are really serviceable. Supports made of paraffin, or of a
        mixture of sulfur and paraffin, do not long remain insulated,
        and the gold-leaf loses its charge. If forced to make sue of
        them, the insulator must be cleaned at least once a day with
        emery paper, an operation all the more necessary from the fact
        that the surface of the dielectric in time becomes charged with
        electricity. An electroscope can only be used for this kind of
        research when it does not give a loss greater than one angular
        degree in one hour after being covered with its cap. </p>
      <p>Instead of the classic two gold leaves, it is better to use
        only one with a rigid central strip of oxidized copper. The
        angular deflection of the gold-leaf is then very sensibly
        proportionate to the potential. With the electroscope I use, a
        deflection of the gold-leaf of 90° corresponds to a charge of
        1300 volts, or of about 14 volts per angular degree. By various
        contrivances, which need not be described here, the
        electroscopes can be constructed so sensitive that one degree
        will represent one-tenth of a volt. </p>
      <p>To read the fall of the gold-leaves, the classic process of a
        microscope with a micrometer attached is not very convenient,
        especially in the case of rapid falls like those produced by
        light. It is much preferable to fix against one of the panes of
        glass forming the sides of the instrument a horn protractor,
        divided into degrees and backed with a sheet of rough white
        paper. To read the divisions, place a small lamp in the dark a
        few yards from the instrument. The gold-leaf throws the shadow
        of its extremity on the unglazed paper, and thus may be read to
        the quarter of a degree. </p>
      <p>To reduce the sometimes troublesome sensitiveness of the
        electroscope during experiments with radioactive bodies, it is
        only necessary to place a strip of metal at varying distances
        from the plate (Figure 37). It acts not only by its capacity but
        also by reducing the quantity of air on which the ions act. A
        radioactive substance which, for instance, produces 18° of
        discharge per minute only gives 12° if the strip be at 5 cm
        distant from the plate, and 8° if brought 2 cm closer. </p>

      <i>Condensing Differential Electroscope</i> ~
      <p>For certain delicate experiments it becomes necessary to use an
        apparatus I have invented and called a condensing differential
        electroscope, which may be thus described: Having noticed from
        various experiments that the effluves proceeding from
        dissociated matter traveled round obstacles, I was led to invent
        an apparatus to make this impossible. By its use I discovered
        that all bodies contain, as do radioactive substances, an
        “emanation” which is constantly reformed. In ordinary bodies it
        is only rapidly dissipated under the influence of heat, and
        takes several days to reform, as will be seen later in these

      <p>In Figure 38, A represents the ball of an electroscope mounted
        on a metallic rod, to the lower part of which are attached the
        gold leaves. This rod is supported by an insulating sulfur
        cylinder D. On this cylinder is placed an aluminum cylinder B,
        closed at the top. A second cylinder C, likewise of aluminum,
        covers the first. It forms a Faraday’s cage, and is only put in
        place after the electroscope has been charged. This cage is the
        only part of the system which must not be insulated, and this is
        prevented by connecting it with the earth by the chain F.
        Moreover, it is placed on the metallic part of the electroscope,
        a condition which, of itself, would prevent its electric
        insulation. </p>
      <p>One must make these aluminum cylinders. After&nbsp; procuring
        the thin sheet aluminum of commerce, it is cut to the height and
        width required and wrapped wound a wooden cylinder, and the two
        ends fastened together with a paper band coated with glue. The
        top of the cylinder is closed by a thin plate of tin, which is
        folded over and glued round it. </p>
      <p>It will be seen that the cylinder C constitutes a Faraday cage
        --- a screen completely protected against all external
        electrical influence. The leaves being charged and the large
        cylinder put in place, it is impossible to discharge the
        electroscope, even if a shower of sparks are made to fall on C.
      </p>
      <p>The method of charging the instrument is as follows: Taking
        away the outer cylinder C and leaving the small cylinder B round
        the ball, the instrument is inductively charged by bringing a
        glass rod rubbed with silk to the cylinder B, which is then
        touched with the finger. It will be readily understood that in
        these conditions the cylinder B is charged negatively, the ball
        A positively, and the gold leaves negatively. The outer cylinder
        C is then put in its place and connected with the earth by a
        chain, an excess of precaution which is by no means
        indispensable. The whole system is then exposed to the influence
        one wishes to act on it. If the cylinder C be penetrated, the
        gold leaves draw together more or less rapidly. </p>
      <p>One can, if one pleases, make the electroscope receive a charge
        under these last conditions. Thus: </p>
      <p>The instrument being charged as before, open the case of the
        electroscope and touch with a metal point the rod E bearing the
        gold leaves. They immediately fall. When the apparatus is
        immediately exposed to a radioactive influence --- solar light,
        for instance --- the leaves then separate several degrees. </p>
      <p>The mechanism of this charge is easy to understand. Let us
        suppose that the instrument has been charged by means of an
        ebonite rod rubbed with catskin. Naturally, it is not the light
        which produces the electricity capable of charging the
        instrument. Its action is indirect. By touching the gold leaves,
        they were deprived pf their positive charges, and therefore
        fall; but the negative charge of the ball, which is maintained
        by the positive electricity of the small cylinder, could not be
        annulled. When this small cylinder begins to discharge under the
        influence of the effluves passing through the large cylinder, it
        will no longer be able to maintain the same quantity of negative
        electricity on the ball. Part of the electricity contained in
        the latter will then flow into the leaves, which, on being
        charged with electricity of the same sign, will diverge. The
        more the small cylinder discharges, the more the leaves will
        separate. The ball and the cylinder form, in a way, the two pans
        of a very sensitive balance. The separation of the gold leaves
        registers the slightest difference in the weights of the two
        pans. It is by reason of this analogy that I have given it the
        name of condensing differential electroscope. </p>
      <p>Such are, in a general way, the instruments used in my
        researches. I shall use many others, but they will be described
        in the chapters devoted to the various experiments. </p>

      </p>
      <p>The bodies under study are arranged in strips, at an
        inclination of 45° above the plate of a charged electroscope
        (Figures 39 and 45), but without any direct connection with it.
        When these bodies are struck by solar light, they emit effluves
        which discharge the electroscope if this last is charged
        positively. But these effluves hardly have any action if the
        electroscope is negatively charged. </p>
      <p>For demonstration purposes it is only necessary to use a simple
        strip of aluminum or zinc, first rubbed with emery paper, and
        fixed in any way above the positively charged plate of the
        electroscope. </p>
      <p>For quantitative experiments I employed the apparatus
        represented in Figure 39, but it is well to avoid as much as
        possible the use of the heliostat and to throw the light
        directly onto the metal to be experimented on. With a heliostat,
        the charge is sensibly reduced in consequence of the absorption
        of the ultraviolet by the surface of the mirror. The glass,
        indeed, hardly refracts more than 5% of the ultraviolet rays. As
        to metals, their refracting power, very great in the infrared,
        diminishes considerably with the length of the waves. Polished
        silver, for instance, hardly refracts 15% of the incident
        ultraviolet radiations of the solar spectrum. At the beginning
        of the ultraviolet range (0.004 microns), on the contrary, it
        refracts nearly 80% of the rays. </p>

      </center>
      The electroscope may be charged by a dry battery or inductively by
      an ebonite rod rubbed with catskin. Care must be taken that the
      gold leaves are always brought to the same potential, and
      consequently separated by the same number of degrees from the
      vertical (20° in my experiments). The shadow of the leaves is
      thrown onto a plate of roughened glass divided into degrees, as
      seen in our figures. The instrument is lighted by a lamp placed 4
      or 5 meters off in a dark place at the end of the room where the
      experiments are made.
      <p>The sources of light employed were: (1) the sun for the
        radiations of which the spectrum extends to 0.295 microns; (2)
        for the radiations extending further into the ultraviolet, I
        took as a source of light the sparks of a condenser discharging
        between aluminum rods placed in a box closed by a plate of
        quartz covered with metal gauze, itself framed in a sheet of
        metal connected with the earth so as to be shut off from all
        electric influence (Figure 40). </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="fig40.jpg" height="274" width="361"></p>
      </center>
      <p>In order that the experiments may be compared, the bodies to be
        acted on by the light are all cut into strips 10 cm square, and
        placed at a distance of 15 cm from the electroscope. The ball of
        this latter is replaced by a large copper plate, which is
        indispensable for obtaining a rapid discharge. Copper is a metal
        but slightly sensitive to solar light but very sensitive to the
        electric light. It is, therefore, not necessary --- though I did
        so --- to shield this last from the action of light when
        operating in the sun; it is, on the contrary, indispensable to
        shield it from the luminous source when using the electric
        light. This is managed by the very simple arrangement shown in
        Figure 40. </p>
      <p>To separate the various regions of the spectrum and determine
        the action of each, we interpose between the light and the body
        it strikes several screens (quartz trough containing a
        transparent solution of quinine sulfate, glass 3 mm thick, glass
        0.1 mm thick, mica 0.01 mm thick, rock salt, quartz, etc.) The
        transparency of these screens to the various rays of the sun is
        first determined by placing them before a spectrograph and
        noting, by means of the spectral rays photographed, the
        wavelength of the radiations which each transparent body allows
        to pass. The spectra here represented (Figures 41 and 42) show
        the results of some of these photographs. Colored glass, green
        and red excepted, cannot be utilized, for they really keep back
        very little, and only serve tor educe the intensity of the
        effect. </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="fig41-42.jpg" height="764" width="437"></p>
      </center>
      Speaking of absorption, I would remark that absorbent bodies seem
      divisible into two classes --- namely specific absorbents and
      absorbents of intensity. By the first the spectrum is stopped dead
      in a particular region, whatever the exposure. The second sort,
      while being specific absorbents for certain regions, only act
      within a tolerably wide limit by reducing the intensity; the
      absorption in this case depends on the length of the exposure.
      Solutions of potassium bichromate or of quinine sulfate are
      specific absorbents; they only allow a particular region of the
      spectrum to pass, and this region is not prolonged whatever be the
      exposure. Uncolored glass exercises a specific absorption for
      certain regions, but throughout one relatively extended part it
      specially acts by reducing the intensity of the active rays --- by
      partially absorbing them. This is why the impression is not
      clearly stopped at a fixed point. Specific absorbents are limited
      in number, while absorbents of intensity are innumerable. All
      colored glasses (red and dark green excepted) only reduce
      intensity. The evident proof of this is obtained by [photographing
      the solar spectrum through colored glass. By slightly lengthening
      the exposure through blue, yellow, violet and other glasses, the
      totality of the visible solar spectrum is obtained. This point is
      interesting to physiologists, for it shows that the various
      experiments made on animals and plants with solar light filtered
      through colored glasses prove absolutely nothing. The differences
      observed are due to causes quite different from those hitherto
      invoked to explain them.
      <p>The following is a table of transparency of the different
        screens or liquids employed by me to isolate the various regions
        of the spectrum. In the region of the extreme ultraviolet of the
        spectrum I availed myself of the kindness of my learned friend
        M. Deslandres for the graduation of the wavelengths. <br>

      <p><i>Action of the Various Parts of the Spectrum on the
          Dissociation of Matter</i> ~ </p>
      <p>By the method described above --- i.e., by various screens
        whose transparency has been determined by the spectrograph, it
        has been found possible to determine, by the rapidity of the
        electroscope’s discharge, the proportion of effluves emitted by
        each body during dissociation, according to the regions of the
        spectrum to which it is subjected; or, in other words, the
        intensity of the dissociation. From this it is seen that bodies
        are very unequally dissociated by light, and that the action
        exercised by the various regions of the spectrum differs
        greatly. These are the results obtained: </p>
      <p>(1) <i>Bodies sensitive to the radiations comprised in the
          solar spectrum, not exceeding 0.295 microns</i> ~ </p>
      <p>The majority of bodies are sensitive, but in extremely
        different proportions. The action may vary, in fact, from 20° of
        discharge of the electroscope in 5 seconds down to only 1 degree
        per minute. Some bodies are therefore about 500 times less
        sensitive than others. </p>
      <p>The following is the order of sensitiveness of the bodies most
        sensitive to sunlight: amalgamated tin, amalgamated copper,
        aluminum recently cleaned, amalgamated silver, clean magnesium,
        clean zinc, amalgamated lead, mercury containing traces of tin.
      </p>
      <p>The least sensitive bodies, those giving only from 1° to 9° of
        discharge in a minute, are: Gold, silver, platinum, copper,
        cobalt, pure mercury, tin, cardboard, wood, phosphorescent
        sulfides, and organic substances. With bodies of feeble
        dissociation, such as those just mentioned, there is generally
        no effect observable except when the solar rays contain the
        region of the spectrum from M to U, a region which often
        disappears, even when the weather is very bright, as I will
        explain shortly. </p>
      <p>If, by means of the screens mentioned above and of their action
        on the electroscope, we ascertain the energy of the various
        regions of the solar spectrum on very sensitive bodies, such as
        amalgamated tin or aluminum, we shall find, representing by 100
        the totality of the action produced, the following figures: </p>
      <p>Action of the solar spectrum reaching to 0.400 microns = 6% <br>
        ... from 0.4 to 0.360 microns = 9% <br>
        ... from 0.360 to 0.29 microns = 85% </p>
      <p>It is possible, by various devices, to render certain bodies
        sensitive for regions where they otherwise are not so. Mercury
        and tin, separately, are bodies with little sensitiveness. It
        suffices, however, to add to the mercury 1/1000 [?] of its
        weight in tin to render t very sensitive for the region of the
        ultraviolet comprised between 0.360 and 0.296 microns. Mercury
        thus prepared is an excellent reagent for the study of the
        ultraviolet according to the hour, the day, and the season. If
        the added quantity of tin amounts to 10%, the mercury becomes
        sensitive for nearly the whole remainder of the spectrum. </p>
      <p>(2) <i>Bodies which become very Sensitive only to Radiations
          having Wavelengths less than 0.295 microns</i> ~ Among these
        bodies I especially mention the following: cadmium, tin, silver,
        lead. </p>
      <p>(3) <i>Bodies which are very Sensitive only to Radiations
          having Wavelengths less than 0.252 microns</i> ~ These are the
        most numerous. Among them may be mentioned the following: Gold,
        platinum, copper, iron, nickel, organic substances, and various
        compounds (sodium sulfates and phosphate, sodium chloride and
        ammonium chloride, etc.). After the metals, the most active
        bodies are lamp-black (20° of discharge per minute) and black
        paper. The least active are living organic bodies, especially
        leaves and plants. </p>
      <p>The various chemical compounds dissociate like simple bodies,
        under the influence of light, but in rather different
        proportions. Sodium phosphate and sulfate give 14° per minute,
        ammonium chloride 8°, sodium chloride 4°, etc. To verify the
        discharge, the bodies are made into a saturated solution that is
        poured onto a glass plate and evaporated. The glass plate is
        then placed in the ordinary manner over the electroscope. </p>
      <p>The variations of discharge which I have given are only of
        value for the particular regions of the spectrum which have been
        enumerated. In proportion as regions of higher refraction are
        employed, the sensitiveness of the various bodies differs less,
        and tends toward equality without, however, reaching that point.
        In the solar ultraviolet, gold, for instance, is almost inactive
        --- about 500 times less active than aluminum. In the extreme
        ultraviolet of the electric light (starting from 0.252 microns
        it has, on the contrary, nearly the same rapidity of
        dissociation as this last metal. In this region of the
        ultraviolet, the difference of action between the least
        sensitive bodies (steel, platinum, and silver) and the most
        sensitive (amalgamated tin, for example) hardly varies more than
        from one to two. </p>
      <p>Moderate conductors --- lamp black, chemical compounds, wood,
        etc. --- have in this advanced region of the spectrum a
        sensitiveness lower than that of metals. The discharge produced
        by the effluves of lamp black, for instance, is much less than
        that of tin. </p>
      <p><i>Influence of Cleaning</i> ~ </p>
      <p>The action of cleaning is of the highest importance for the
        metals subjected to the radiations contained in the solar
        spectrum. They should be vigorously cleaned every 10 minutes
        with very fine emery cloth, under the penalty of seeing the
        discharge become 200 times less rapid. In the ultraviolet,
        starting from 0.252 microns, the influence of the cleaning is
        still manifest, but much less so than in solar light. It will do
        if the surface has not remained uncleaned for more than about 10
        days. After 10 days the discharge is hardly more than half what
        it is after recent cleaning. </p>
      <p><i>Influence of the Nature of the Electrodes</i> ~ </p>
      <p>When, in order to obtain radiations extending much farther into
        the ultraviolet than those of the solar system, sparks from
        condensers (two Leyden jars placed in series on the secondary of
        an induction coil) are used, the intensity of the dissociation
        varies greatly with the nature of the metal of the electrodes. </p>
      <p>Aluminum points give a light producing a dissociation which,
        all things being equal, is nearly 3 times greater than that from
        gold points. Electrodes of copper and silver give about the same
        figures as gold electrodes. </p>
      <p>The first explanation which occurs to the mind is, that certain
        metals possess a more extended spectrum than others. But this
        explanation is nullified by recent measurements made by Eder,
        who has shown that the spectra of most metals extend to about
        the same distance into the ultraviolet. It is thus, for
        instance, that the spectrum of the sparks from gold, electrodes
        of which are the least active, extends quite as far (0.185
        microns) as the spectrum from aluminum, electrodes of which are
        the most so. </p>
      <p>Nor does it mean that the differences of effect observed under
        the influence of the light produced by the sparks from various
        metals are due to differences of intensity of light. I find the
        proof of this in the fact that photographic paper prepared with
        silver chloride, when placed for 60 seconds before the quartz
        window which closes the spark-box, presents the same intensity
        of impression with all metals excepting steel electrodes, when
        it is more intense than with the sparks produced by aluminum,
        this being precisely the opposite to what occurs in the power of
        the dissociating action of their light. During these short
        exposures it is only radiations below 0.310 microns which act on
        the paper, as is proved by the fact that the interposition of
        thin glass selected so as to stop the radiations of a wavelength
        under 0.310 microns, also stops the impression. </p>
      <p>The preceding fact relative to the very great difference in
        electrodes according to the metals of which they are composed,
        would seem to prove that the spectrum of the various metals
        contains, in addition to light, a something with which we are
        not acquainted. </p>
      <p><i>Influence of the Varying Composition of the Solar Light on
          its Fitness to Produce the Dissociation of Bodies.
          Disappearance at Certain Moments of the Ultraviolet</i> ~ </p>
      <p>When working with solar light it is very soon noticed that
        numerous factors may vary enormously the production of the
        effluves resulting from the dissociation of matter, and
        consequently the intensity of the discharge. I shall come back
        to this subject when treating of the so-called negative leak. As
        soon as I had organized a series of regular observations,
        consisting of experiments with bodies having a constant action,
        I perceived that, when working for several days running at the
        same hour and in apparently identical weather, I suddenly
        observed considerable differences in the action of the
        electroscope. After having successively eliminated all
        intervening factors, I was left face to face with only one ---
        the variation in the composition of the solar light. This was
        then only an hypothesis and had to be verified. As the
        variations were probably connected with the invisible parts of
        the spectrum, one single method of verification was at my
        disposal --- the photography of this invisible region by the
        spectroscope. The only hint given in the textbooks was that the
        ultraviolet disappears as the sun approaches the horizon, which,
        however, the action of the electroscope ought to have
        sufficiently indicated. But as I was noticing variations in the
        effects at the same hours every day and at a time when the sun
        was very high, this hint explained nothing. </p>
      <p>Photographs of the spectrum repeated for several months showed
        me, in conformity with my previsions, that from one day to
        another, and often on the same day, without apparently any cause
        for the phenomenon, the greater part of the solar ultraviolet,
        starting from the L or M rays, sometimes disappeared abruptly
        (Figure 43). This phenomenon always coincided with the slowness
        of the discharge of the electroscope. The apparent state of the
        sky had no connection with this disappearance of the
        ultraviolet, for its was sometimes manifest in very bright
        weather, while, on the contrary, I noticed the ultraviolet
        remained constant under a very cloudy sky. However, here are
        some of the results obtained: </p>
      <p>23 August 1901, 3:50 pm. Very fine weather, disappearance of
        the ultraviolet beginning with the M ray. <br>
        30 August 1901, 11 am. Very fine weather, disappearance of the
        uv beginning with L. <br>
        31 August 1901, 3 pm. Very hazy weather, sky entirely clouded,
        no disappearance of the uv. <br>
        26 October and 12 November 1901, 2 pm. Fine weather,
        disappearance of the uv beginning with M. </p>

      <p>It will be seen from the above that if the eye, instead of
        being sensible to the radiations going from the A to the H rays,
        were sensible only to the radiations going from H to U, we
        should find ourselves, now and then, though in full sunshine,
        plunged into darkness. </p>
      <p>The ultraviolet possess, according to my experiments, so
        special and so energetic an action that it must be supposed to
        have an active part in the phenomena of nature. It is to be
        desired that regular researches should be instituted in
        observatories on its presence and its disappearance in the
        light. In conjunction with this, studies might be made on the
        variations of the infrared, for which I have shown there exists
        a reagent --- zinc sulfide with green [copper] phosphorescence
        --- as sensitive as silver gelatino-bromide is for visible
        light. The invisible spectrum has, it is well-known, a much
        greater extent than that of the visible spectrum. It is probable
        that its really very easy study might raise meteorology from the
        wholly rudimentary state in which it still is at the present
        day. </p>

      <p><i>Identity of the Products of the Dissociation of Bodies by
          Light with those Derived from Radioactive Substances</i> ~ </p>
      <p>I have always upheld the analogy of the effluves of dissociated
        matter as shown in the foregoing experiments with those emitted
        by spontaneously radioactive bodies. Lenard and Thomson have,
        since my researches, made this identity indisputable by
        demonstrating their derivation by a magnetic field and by
        measuring the ratio e / m between the charge of the particles
        and their mass. This ratio has been found to be identical with
        that observed with the cathode rays, and the particles of
        radioactive bodies. The condensation of water vapor by the
        particles of matter dissociated by the influence of light ---
        which produces, as we know, cathode rays --- has likewise been
        obtained by Lenard. </p>
      <p><i>Photographic Action of the Particles of Bodies Dissociated
          by Light </i>~ </p>
      <p>The study of this photographic action caused me in the past a
        great loss of time; I abandoned it because, in reality, by
        reason of its irregularity, it does not constitute a process of
        measurement, while the electroscope affords a precise one. I
        will only say that when a sensitized glass plate, enclosed in an
        envelope of black paper and covered by some object or other, is
        exposed --- well-protected from all light --- to the effluves of
        a metal struck by the sun, there will be obtained, after 15
        minutes exposure, the outline of the object placed on the black
        paper. </p>
      <p>With metals exposed directly to the sun the impression on the
        photographic plate is sometimes intense, sometimes nil, and is
        too uncertain, in short, to provide a scientific means of
        investigation. </p>
      <p>I have always observed, besides, that after a certain exposure
        t the sun, a metal generally loses the property of giving a
        photographic image, even when a sensitized plate is exposed in
        the dark, directly on the surface of the insolated metal,
        instead of being placed beneath it. This phenomenon occurs, as I
        shall show later, through the metal exhausting rapidly, under
        the influence of slight heat, the provision of radioactive
        emanation it contains, which is only formed again very slowly. </p>
      <p><i>Diffusion of the Effluves proceeding from the Dissociation
          of Bodies by Light </i>~ </p>
      <p>One of the most curious properties I have noticed in these
        effluves is the rapidity of their diffusion, which enables them
        at once to pass round all obstacles. This diffusion is so
        considerable that, in the experiments given above, the plate of
        the electroscope may be placed behind the metallic mirror,
        entirely hidden by it, and consequently protected from all
        light, without the discharge being suppressed. With a mirror of
        aluminum it is only reduced to a seventh of what it was
        previously. If the electroscope be placed laterally beside the
        mirror so that its extreme edge is 1 cm within the vertical line
        of its edges, the discharge is hardly reduced by one-tenth. If
        the electroscope be removed to 10 cm from the same edge of the
        mirror, the discharge is only reduced by three-quarters. The
        effluves, consequently, have entirely gone round the obstacle
        formed by the mirror. No doubt the propagation has partly been
        effected by the air, and also by the sides of the mirror itself,
        to which the dissociated particles seem to adhere and to slide
        along unless they are stopped by a non-metallic surface. This
        can be proved by the following experiment which succeeds very
        well in the sun: </p>
      <p>A strip of aluminum of which the face is intentionally well
        oxidized to render it inactive, and the other face cleaned with
        emery paper is placed above the electroscope (Figure 47), so
        that the cleaned face shall alone be struck by the light and
        shall project effluves onto the plate of the electroscope. The
        discharge of the instrument corresponds under these conditions
        to 20° in 15 seconds. The strip of metal is then turned around
        so that it is the oxidized face which faces the electroscope,
        and the cleaned face is towards the sun. The effluves produced
        can then only act on the electroscope by passing round the
        strip. Now, the discharge is still 5° in 15 seconds. Without
        changing anything in the above experiment, a band of black paper
        2 cm in width is gummed onto the borders of the non-oxidized
        face towards the sun. The band prevents the passing round of the
        particles, and the discharge of the electroscope ceases. </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="fig47.jpg" height="633" width="513"></p>
      </center>
      <p>Metals struck by light for the most part retain a small
        residual charge, which allows them to slightly discharge the
        electroscope in the dark for a few minutes. It therefore
        suffices to expose to the sun a cleaned piece of metal, and to
        place it in the dark above the electroscope, for a slight
        discharge to be produced for a few moments. </p>
      <p><i>Mechanism of the Discharge of Bodies Electrified by the
          Particles of Dissociated Matter</i> ~ </p>
      <p>The mechanism of the discharge of bodies electrified by the
        effluves of dissociated matter by light, by the gases of flames,
        by the emanations of radioactive bodies, or by the cathode rays,
        is always the same. All of them act by rendering the air a
        conductor. Figure 44 and the explanation makes the mechanism of
        their action plain. </p>
      <p><i>Transparency of Matter to the Effluves of Dissociated Atoms</i>
        ~ </p>
      <p>Do the particles of dissociated matter pass through material
        objects? We know that this is the case with the beta rays of
        radium, but not with the alpha rays which form 99% of the
        emission and are stopped by a thin sheet of paper. How do
        matters stand with the particles of bodies dissociated by light?
      </p>
      <p>It appears easy, at first sight, to verify the phenomenon of
        transparency. As we possess a reagent sensitive to certain
        radiations, the body of which we wish to test the transparency.
        If the effect be produced through the object, we shall say the
        body has been transpierced. Nothing is more simple in
        appearance, and nothing more erroneous in reality. </p>
      <p>It sometimes happens, in fact, that a body appears to have been
        transpierced when this has not been at all the case. It may have
        simply had its flank turned, which is exactly what happens in
        the case of very diffusible bodies, as was shown in the last
        paragraph, or as happens in the case of radiations with great
        wavelength --- the Hertzian waves, for instance. It is this
        apparent transparency which formerly deceived physicists as to
        the supposed transparency of conducting and insulating bodies to
        electric waves. This transparency was admitted till the
        researches I carried out with Branly proved that mountains and
        houses were passed by going round and not through them, and that
        if metals seemed to be transpierced, it was because the Hertzian
        waves passed through the cracks of the boxes which seemed to be
        hermetically closed --- and, in fact, were so to light. </p>
      <p>The apparent transparency may also be the consequence of the
        fact that when one face of a body is struck by a radiation there
        is produced, by a kind of induction, an identical radiation on
        that part of the other face which corresponds to the point
        struck. J. J. Thomson has maintained that this was precisely the
        case with the cathode rays, and Villard believes it to be the
        case with metals which are acted on by the radiations of radium.
        The photographic impression through a metal would be the simple
        consequence of a secondary emission on the posterior face of the
        strip opposite to the point struck. </p>
      <p>We have a rough example of what happens in these various cases
        by taking, for instance, the propagation of sound. A person shut
        up within a completely closed metal chamber will hear very
        clearly all the musical instruments played outside that chamber.
        The vibrations of the air which produce the sound appear thus to
        pass through the metal. We know, however, that it is not so, and
        that the air which strikes the metal walls of the faces of the
        metal are propagated to the other face, which in run causes the
        air in contact with it to vibrate. The vibrations seem thus to
        have passed through the metal, which, notwithstanding, is
        absolutely opaque to the air. </p>
      <p>A like reasoning, however, may perhaps be applied to all forms
        of the transparency of bodies. We might even include the case of
        transparency to light, could this hypothesis be easily
        reconciled with the phenomena of aberration. </p>
      <p>However this may be, the complete solution of the problem of
        transparency is difficult, and the single fact that eminent
        physicists have been unable to agree on the transparency of
        bodies for the cathode rays and for the emanations of
        radioactive bodies is sufficient to show the difficulties of the
        question. All we can say about an apparently transparent body is
        that things occur exactly as if it were transparent. </p>
      <p>In the case of the effluves from matter dissociated by light,
        the problem is further complicated by the extreme diffusion of
        these effluves, which enables them, as we have seen, to go round
        objects. To simply interpose a strip of metal between the
        effluves and the electroscope would lead to erroneous results.
        It would have to be of excessively large dimensions, which would
        not be very workable. </p>
      <p>To prove the transparency --- or, if it be preferred, the
        equivalent of transparency --- it is necessary that the body one
        wishes to work with should be surrounded by an enclosure shut up
        on all sides. This I was able to obtain by means of my
        condensing differential electroscope, thanks to which it has
        been possible to study the transparency of bodies for the
        effluves emitted by light, by radioactive bodies, by the gas of
        flames, by chemicals reactions, etc. Its use has permitted us to
        verify transparency, but in further studying the phenomenon, I
        was led to recognize, as will be detailed later on, that all
        bodies contain an emanation similar to that belonging to
        spontaneously radioactive bodies, which appears to be the cause
        of the actions observed. </p>
      <p><i>Elimination of Causes of Error. Influence of the Hertzian
          Waves accompanying the Electric Sparks used to Produce the
          Ultraviolet</i> ~ </p>
      <p>All the experiments described above are extremely easy of
        repetition when made with the sun. There are only two
        precautions to be observed in this case. The first is to clean
        vigorously with emery cloth every 10 minutes the metal operated
        on, an operation not required when using the ultraviolet rays
        obtained by means of electric sparks; the second consists in
        replacing the ordinary knob of the electroscope, with which the
        charge is insignificant, by a copper plate about 10 cm in
        diameter. It is quite unnecessary to clean this latter. </p>
      <p>The importance of a large receiving surface is paramount, and
        it is because many observers have neglected this essential point
        that they have been unable to repeat my former experiments. </p>
      <p>When we have to do with very refrangible radiations, which do
        not exist in the solar spectrum at our altitudes, and can only
        be produced by means of electric sparks, the experiments become
        much more delicate; and if certain precautions are not taken, we
        are exposed to the causes of error I now point out. The most
        important consists in the action of electric influences capable
        of discharging the electroscope. Doubtless it suffices to hide
        the light of the sparks with black paper to be able to see if
        all discharges are suppressed, which is not the case when
        electrical influences supervene. But when one notices that these
        last are produced, it is not always an easy matter to suppress
        them. </p>
      <p>The means generally employed to eliminate them consists in
        covering the quartz window of the spark-box with fine
        transparent wire gauze let into a frame made of a large strip of
        metal and connected with the earth, but this means is not always
        sufficient. Invariably examining after each experiment whether
        the action on the electroscope ceased when the light was covered
        up with black paper, several times I perceived rapid discharges
        due to electrical influences. As they did not act equally on
        both the positive and the negative electricity with which the
        electroscope was charged, but only on one of them, I conceived
        the idea of getting rid of them by connecting with the earth,
        without any change in the rest of the arrangements, one or other
        of the coatings of the Leyden jars employed according to the
        direction of the discharge observed. This means always
        succeeded. </p>
      <p>What is the origin of the electrical influences which are
        formed round the sparks of the electrodes, and of which
        physicists have often pointed out the existence and the effects
        without ever attempting to determine their nature? Not being
        able to find any hints on the subject, I was led to inquire of
        what they consisted. They are simply very small Hertzian waves.
        It was difficult to anticipate this, for they were not supposed
        to be produced by discharges between points. </p>
      <p>Their existence is proved, either by the illumination at a
        distance of a Geissler tube (which necessitates working in the
        dark) or, better, by using a coherer in circuit with an easily
        working bell and a battery. This apparatus, which may remain
        fixed, immediately reveals to the ear, by the ringing of the
        bell, the formation of any Hertzian waves which may interfere
        with the experiments. </p>
      <p>By bearing in mind the researches I made together with Branly,
        on the enormous diffraction of the Hertzian waves which permits
        them to travel round all obstacles, and on the passage of these
        waves through the smallest crevices, it will be understood that
        it is very difficult, notwithstanding all possible precautions,
        to avoid their influence when they form. They must therefore be
        prevented from forming. Here are, from my observations, some of
        the condition in which they are generated: </p>
      <p>Hertzian waves manifest themselves when the spark-box is not
        carefully insulated from its support by a coating of paraffin.
        They also manifest themselves when the electrodes are too far
        apart, and especially when their points are blunted, which
        happens when they have been working for some time. The Hertzian
        waves which then form are very small and are hardly propelled
        farther than 50 to 60 cm, but they are sufficient to disturb the
        experiments. They disappear as soon as the extremities of the
        electrodes have been filed to very sharp points. </p>
      <p>There exist other causes of the production of Hertzian waves in
        these experiments, but to enumerate them would carry us too far.
        With the arrangement I have described and figured in the plates,
        the operator will always be warned of their presence. </p>
      <p>Among the causes of error which I must point out, there is one
        which has never, to my knowledge, been mentioned anywhere, and
        is of considerable importance. I refer to the superficial
        alteration of a strip of quartz exposed for less than a quarter
        of an hour to the sparks of the electrodes. It becomes covered
        with an almost invisible layer of particles of dust which
        suffice to render it opaque to the ultraviolet rays inferior to
        0.250 microns. When quartz thus altered is used, it is as if use
        were made of a strip of thin glass, opaque, as we know, to the
        extreme ultraviolet, and all the effects observed are falsified.
        This cause of error, which occasioned me much loss of time, is
        very easy to avoid, since it is sufficient to wipe the quartz
        with fine linen clothe every 10 or 15 minutes. </p>
      <p>All these causes of error may also have an influence on the
        so-called negative leak which we shall shortly study. </p>
      <p><i>Interpretation of the Preceding Experiments</i> ~ </p>
      <p>We have already interpreted the experiments set forth in this
        chapter, and shall simply recall the fact that all the products
        of the dissociation of bodies by light are identical with those
        obtained from radioactive substances. There is the same
        deviation of the particles by a magnetic field, the same ration
        e / m of the mass to the electric charge, etc. </p>
      <p>But how are we to explain this dissociating action of a weak
        ray of light on a rigid metal? The explanation is not easy. I
        shall confine myself to reproducing that given by Prof. de Heen
        in his memoir, Les Phenomenes dits Cathodiques et Radio-actifs:
      </p>
      <p>"When a luminous ray falls on the surface of a metallic mirror,
        the ions vibrate in unison with part or the whole of the
        radiations striking it. Therefore, during the action of this
        radiation, a superficial pellicule of infinitesimal thickness
        vibrates with the frequency of certain oscillations of the
        source itself. In the case of luminous and ultraviolet
        radiations, this surface actually corresponds to an excessive
        temperature imperceptible to the touch, because, its thickness
        being very slight, the quantity of heat confined in this
        pellicule is entirely negligible. </p>
      <p>"Now, if this is so, the metallic surface, subjected to a
        luminous and, more especially, to an ultraviolet radiation, will
        be traversed in all direction by currents which we shall term
        high-frequency currents. </p>
      <p>"The ions will be subjected to such repellant actions that they
        will jump. Thenceforth the surrounding space will be subject to
        ionic projections, or radiations, similar to those noticed in
        vacuum tubes. </p>
      <p>"Such is the interpretation of the fundamental fact discovered
        for the first time by Gustave Le Bon, which will be found at the
        basis of this new chapter in physics. This physicist thenceforth
        supposed that this manifestation belonged to an order of natural
        phenomena that is absolutely general. It was this idea, much
        more than the admirable experiment of Roentgen, which decided me
        to take up the study of electric phenomena". </p>

        <br>
      </p>
      <p>The idea that radioactivity is due to chemical reactions led me
        to search for the means of rendering artificially radioactive
        bodies which are not so. In this case we are quite certain that
        the presence of radium, uranium, or other similar substance
        counts for nothing in the radioactivity. </p>
      <p>It will be seen later on that various chemical reactions, such
        as hydration, can produce this radioactivity. I shall now show
        that bodies presenting only traces of radioactivity under the
        influence of light, such as mercury, can, on the other hand,
        become extremely radioactive. It is sufficient to add to this
        metal a 1/1000 [1/5000 ??] --- the text is illegible ] its
        weight in tin, a body which is no more radioactive under the
        influence of ordinary light than mercury. With this proportion
        of tin, mercury is sensitive only to the solar ultraviolet from
        0.360 microns to 0.296 microns; but if the proportion of tin be
        increased to 1%, the mercury is dissociated by most of the rays
        of the visible spectrum. </p>
      <p>It was interesting to compare the radioactivity artificially
        given to a body with that of spontaneously radioactive bodies
        such as thorium and uranium. The experiment being very
        important, I will simplify it to such a degree that it can be
        repeated easily at a lecture. </p>
      <p>The first thing to determine is the degree of dissociation of a
        body by light, and then to compare it with that of a
        spontaneously radioactive substance --- a salt of uranium, for
        instance. We shall see that the dissociation provoked by light
        is much more important. </p>
      <p>A strip of tin is taken, 10 cm square and 2 cm thick. Its
        border are fastened by means of four narrow bands of gummed
        paper to a cardboard screen of the same size, and the whole is
        plunged for 24 hours into a bath of mercury, wiping off from
        time to time the layer of oxide formed on the surface. The strip
        thus prepared, which the cardboard prevents from breaking, will
        indefinitely retain its radioactivity under the influence of
        light so long as its surface in very slightly wiped with the
        finger from time to time. </p>
      <p>This done, the experiment is arranged as indicated in Figure
        45. The electroscope is inductively charged by an ebonite rod;
        its charge is, in consequence, positive. </p>
      <p>By arranging the strip of tin so that the sun may strike its
        surface, it will be noticed that the gold leaves draw together
        in a few seconds. With a diffused light, the discharge still
        takes place, but more slowly. </p>
      <p>Having noted the number of degrees of discharge in a given
        time, the experiment is commenced anew with a screen covered
        with a salt of uranium, prepared in the following manner: </p>
      <p>Uranium nitrate is pounded in some bronzing varnish, and spread
        on a cardboard screen of exactly the same size as the strip used
        in the preceding experiment (10 cm x 10 cm). If this screen be
        arranged, and the electroscope charged as previously indicated,
        (Figure 45), a discharge of about 6 degrees in 60 seconds will
        be noted. By operating in the sun with a mirror of amalgamated
        tin placed at exactly the same distance from the electroscope,
        it was shown that this latter discharged itself at the rate of
        40° in 10 seconds. It is therefore seen that artificial
        radioactivity given to a metal by light may be 40 times greater
        than the spontaneous radioactivity possessed by salts of
        uranium. With thorium oxide, approximate figures are obtained.
        If we suppose, with Rutherford, that 1 gram of uranium emits
        70,000 particles/ second, it follows that metals, which under
        the dissociating influence of light have an activity four times
        as great, would emit, surfaces being equal, 3,000,000
        particles/second. </p>

      </p>
      <p>Since Hertz’ experiments, it has been shown that a conducting
        body electrified negatively loses its charge if it be subjected
        to the action of the ultraviolet rays obtained from electric
        sparks, and it is recognized in more recent works: </p>
      <p>(1) That this leak can only take place under the influence of
        the ultraviolet; <br>
        (2) That it is the same for all metals; <br>
        (3) That the discharge only takes pace when the charge of the
        metal is negative and not positive. </p>
      <p>Elster, Geitel, and Branly, it is true, mentioned some time ago
        two or three metals which discharged in ordinary sunlight, and
        the last-named cited several bodies which show the positive
        leak; but these phenomena were considered as exceptional and as
        in no wise possessing a general character. </p>
      <p>As the subject did not appear to me exhausted, I deemed it well
        to take it up anew. Although there is a certain difference
        between the phenomena of the discharge of a body already
        electrified and that of the production of effluves emanating
        from an unelectrified body and capable of acting on an
        electrified one as shown in the previous chapter, yet the two
        phenomena have the same cause --- namely, the dissociation of
        matter by light. No experimenter had suspected this cause before
        my researches. </p>
      <p>The experiments I am going to set forth prove --- (1) that the
        so-called negative leak is also, though generally in a lesser
        degree, positive; (2) that the discharge takes place under the
        influence of the various regions of the spectrum, although the
        maximum occurs in the ultraviolet; (3) that the discharge is
        extremely different in the various bodies, the metals
        especially. These are, as will be seen, three propositions
        exactly contrary to those generally received and recapitulated
        above, Now for the justification of them. </p>
      <p><i>Method of Observation</i> ~ </p>
      <p>For studying the negative leak in solar light the method of
        observation is quite simple, since we have only to place the
        body, the discharge of which is to be observed, on the plate of
        the electroscope, and it charges itself at the same time as the
        latter. This charge is given by influence either by a glass or
        an ebonite rod, according to the sign of the charge desired.
        Care must be taken that the gold leaves are the same distance
        apart in all cases. </p>
      <p>When it is desired to study the discharge produced by the
        ultraviolet rays beyond the solar spectrum, recourse must be had
        to the special arrangement shown in Figure 46. </p>
      <p>The bodies to be studied are fixed in a clamp replacing the
        ball of the electroscope. They become charged with electricity
        at the same time as the latter. The light is supplied by
        aluminum electrodes connected with the coatings of a condenser
        kept charged by an induction coil giving sparks of about 20 cm.
        The electrodes are placed in a box with a quartz window covered
        over with wire gauze framed in a sheet of metal and earthed. </p>
      <p>The distance at which the electrified body is placed from the
        source of light plays, at least for very refrangible rays, a
        most important part, and it is useful to mount the electroscope,
        as I did, on a graduated bar which allows its distance from the
        source of light to be regulated. </p>
      <p>When one wishes to separate the various rays of the spectrum,
        one works, as I said before, by means of various screens
        interposed between the source of light and the electroscope, and
        the transparency of the screens is determined by the
        spectrograph. </p>
      <p>When the experiments are made in the sun, the plates of metal
        must be very frequently cleaned with emery cloth (every 10
        minutes at least), but as we advance into the ultraviolet this
        cleaning becomes of less importance.&nbsp; It needs be cleaned
        only once every two or three days. With so long an interval when
        operating in the sun, the discharge would not be entirely
        suppressed, but would become more than a hundred times less. For
        the light from electric sparks, the omission of the cleaning
        only reduces the discharge by a half or two-thirds. </p>
      <p>I have, however, succeeded in forming alloys requiring, for
        experiments in the sun, no cleaning and preserving their
        properties for about a fortnight, with the simple precaution of
        passing a finger on their surface, from time to time, in order
        to clear away the dust or the slight layer of oxide that may
        have formed. The best are strips of amalgamated tin prepared as
        directed in a former paragraph. </p>
      <p><i>Negative Leak in the Light of the Sun</i> ~ </p>
      <p>The following table shows the rate of discharge in light of a
        strip of metal 10 cm square placed on the plate of the
        electroscope. This rapidity is calculated from the time
        necessary to produce a discharge of 10°, the maximum of rapidity
        being represented by 1000. </p>
      <p><i>Rapidity of the Negative Leak in the Solar Light:</i> </p>
      <p>Amalgamated tin = 1000 <br>
        Amalgamated zinc = 980 <br>
        Aluminum (clean) = 800 <br>
        Amalgamated silver = 770 <br>
        Magnesium (clean) = 600 <br>
        Zinc (clean) = 240 <br>
        Amalgamated Lead = 240 <br>
        Cadmium = 14 <br>
        Cobalt = 12 <br>
        Gold, steel, copper, nickel, mercury, lead, silver,
        phosphorescent sulfides, carbon, marble, wood, sand, etc. = 2
        maximum </p>
      <p>All these bodies discharge themselves when charged positively,
        but in the light of the sun the leak is throughout very weak (1
        degree at most in 1 or 2 minutes). It increases greatly when the
        light of the sun is replaced by the light from electric sparks,
        but its maximum is no way produces, as is the case with the
        negative leak, by the radiations of the end of the spectrum. The
        fact is proved by this very simple experiment. A thin strip of
        glass one-tenth of a millimeter thick which considerably retards
        the negative leak in many cases when placed before the source of
        light, has only a very feeble diminishing action on the positive
        leak. The radiations which produce the negative leak are,
        therefore, not the same as those producing the positive leak. </p>
      <p><i>Leak with Bodies Charged with Either Sign in the Electric
          Ultraviolet Light</i> ~ </p>
      <p>Substances in strips are arranged as before, or, what comes to
        the same thing, are fixed vertically on the electroscope by a
        clamp as in Figure 46. The source of light (electric sparks) is
        placed at 20 cm from the body on which it is to act. The tables
        below give, for this distance, the intensity of the discharge of
        the bodies charged either negatively or positively under the
        light from electric sparks. The greatest negative leak
        corresponds to 6°/second (360°/minute); the slowest to
        1/2°/second&nbsp; (30°/minute). For the positive discharge it is
        much weaker, since it varies between 7° and 16°/minute. Taking
        1000 as the maximum rapidity of leak, the following figures are
        obtained: </p>
      <p>(1)<i> Negative Leak in the Ultraviolet Light of Electric
          Sparks:</i> <br>
        Aluminum = 1000 <br>
        Amalgamated tin = 680 <br>
        Zinc = 610 <br>
        Red Copper = 390 <br>
        Cadmium = 340 <br>
        Cobalt = 270 <br>
        Tin = 270 <br>
        Nickel =240 <br>
        Lead = 210 <br>
        Silver = 200 <br>
        Steel (polished) = 80 </p>
      <p>(2) <i>Positive Leak Under the Same Light</i> ~ <br>
        The discharge of the electroscope varies from 16° /minute in the
        case of nickel, zinc, and silver to 7° in that of steel. There
        is, therefore, no question of an insignificant discharge, but of
        a really very important one. </p>
      <p>The above figures represent the leak produced by the totality
        of the luminous radiations given by the sparks proceeding from
        aluminum electrodes. </p>
      <p>From the foregoing we may conclude that all electrified bodies
        exposed to the ultraviolet light are subject to a negative or
        positive leak without any other difference than that of
        intensity. </p>
      <p>Far from being identical in all bodies, as was asserted up to
        the present, this leak varies considerably according to the
        bodies employed. </p>
      <p><i>Sensitiveness of Various Bodies to the Different Regions of
          the Ultraviolet. Elimination of Causes of Error</i> ~ </p>
      <p>The rapidity of the discharge of divers bodies varies greatly
        with the several regions of the spectrum, as may be gathered
        from the hints in a preceding paragraph. Some, such as aluminum,
        zinc, etc. are sensitive to the regions of the visible solar
        spectrum; others, to the extreme region of the ultraviolet of
        the electric spectrum; which is why a simple plate of glass,
        one-tenth cm thick, placed before the quartz window of the
        spark-box stops all discharges for the nickel series, but stops
        only a part of the discharge produced by the other. </p>
      <p>The figures given above show that there is a predominance of
        the negative leak over the positive for good constructing bodes
        --- that is to say, metals. It is otherwise with bad conductors
        such as wood, cardboard, paper, etc. For these latter the
        positive discharge, as pointed out by Branly, may become equal
        to the negative discharge, and even exceed it. But we must here
        take account of two sources of error which appear to have
        escaped former observers. </p>
      <p>The first, already mentioned, is the state of the quartz. If
        not cleaned every 10 minutes it absorbs the extreme region of
        the ultraviolet, and as this absorption does not prevent the
        positive leak produced by less refrangible regions, the negative
        discharge will be diminished, and consequently may appear the
        same as or less than the positive leak. Such would be the case
        with a metal much oxidized or covered by a greasy body which is
        sensitive only to the extreme regions of the ultraviolet. </p>
      <p>The second cause of error is the considerable influence of
        distance. The most extreme regions of the spectrum are most
        active on the negative discharge, while they have a rather weak
        action of the positive. Being absorbed by the air in an
        increasing degree as its density increases, it follows that
        their effect on the negative discharge becomes slower as the
        distance from the source of light is increased. Thus, at 25 cm
        from the spark, the positive discharge of wood will be double
        the negative discharge; at 8 cm it is the other way: the
        negative leak will then be four times greater than the positive.
        The paramount importance of distance in these experiments is
        therefore obvious. To this should be added that at a short
        distance the dissociation of gases of the air begins to manifest
        itself --- a matter I will go into later. </p>
      <p>Having made these reservations, I give here the positive and
        negative discharges observed in some of the bodies in which
        experiments were made a t a distance of 25 cm: </p>
      <p><i>Substance ~ Neg. Discharge in 1 Min. ~ Pos Disch. In 1 Min.</i>
      </p>
      <p>Wood (Teak, deal, plane) ~ 6° ~ 10° <br>
        Yellow cardboard ~ 1° ~ 16° <br>
        Lamp-Black ~ 61° ~ 7° </p>
      <p>It will be seen that for several of the bodies on which the
        experiments were made, the positive discharge was markedly
        superior to the negative discharge. The rays which produce the
        negative discharge on these various bodies have a wavelength
        under 0.252 microns, and it suffices to suppress them from the
        spectrum for the negative charge to be likewise suppressed. </p>
      <p>The sensitiveness of black bodies, especially lamp-black spread
        on a strip of cardboard, is considerable. I have obtained 61° of
        negative discharge/minute at a distance of 25 cm from the spark,
        but at 10 cm, it rises to figures which would represent 300° for
        the same length of time (figures approaching the sensibility of
        the most sensitive metals). With the same variations in
        distance, the positive leak only increases from 7° to 12°. </p>
      <p><i>Influence of the Nature of the Electrodes ~</i> </p>
      <p>The nature of the electrodes employed to produce the electric
        sparks has a considerable influence, as already stated, and this
        influence is not the same for the positive as for the negative
        discharge. The following table gives the leak per minute,
        calculated from the number of seconds necessary to produce 10°
        of discharge, with electrodes of various metals acting by the
        light they produce on a strip of electrified zinc connected with
        the electroscope: </p>
      <p><i>Electrode Substance ~ Neg. Discharge in 1 Min. ~ Pos Disch.
          In 1 Min.</i> </p>
      <p>Aluminum ~ 246° ~ 18° <br>
        Steel ~ 140° ~ 10° <br>
        Gold ~ 112° ~ 4° <br>
        Copper ~ 110° ~ 3° <br>
        Silver ~ 108° ~ 6° </p>
      <p>According to the electrodes used, the negative discharge may,
        it will be seen, vary from single to double, and the positive
        discharge from single to triple. I have already shown that this
        phenomenon is not due to the length of the spectrum of the
        metals, since that of gold goes as far as that of aluminum. </p>
      <p>By comparing the various tables published in this work, it will
        be seen that the leak produced by solar light is far different
        from that resulting from the action of electric light. This is
        due solely to the fact that the spectrum of the light from
        electric sparks is much further extended into the ultraviolet
        than that of the solar light. </p>
      <p>It is easy to give to the electric spectrum properties
        identical with those of the solar spectrum, y arresting in the
        former case the rays which do not exist in the latter. All that
        is required for this, is to replace the quartz in front of the
        sparks by a glass plate 0.8 m. thick. This stops all radiations
        which do not occur in the solar spectrum --- those exceeding
        0.295 microns. It is then noticed that metals which, like
        copper, produce a very rapid discharge in the electric light and
        hardly any in the sun, become insensible to the electric light,
        while metals like aluminum, which produce a discharge in the
        sun, continue to produce it in the electric light. </p>
      <p><i>Divers Influences Able to Vary the Leak of Electricity Under
          the Action of Light ~</i> </p>
      <p>Several causes, in addition to those mentioned already, also
        cause the leak of electricity to vary under the action of light,
        notably of that of the sun. As in order to study these
        variations a body with a constant sensitiveness was required, I
        made use of plates of amalgamated tin as before mentioned. This
        substance is extremely active, but only attains its maximum of
        intensity after an exposure of some minutes to the light, a fact
        precisely contrary to what is observed in various metals,
        especially aluminum and zinc. </p>
      <p>The best of all bodies with a constant sensitiveness, if its
        manipulation were not so inconvenient, is mercury containing a
        small proportion of tin. With 1/1000 [1/5000 ? --- illegible
        fine print in text] of its weight in tin, as I have said, only
        sensitive to the advanced regions of the solar ultraviolet,
        beyond about the ray M. By increasing the proportion of tin to 1
        percent, it becomes sensitive for a far more extended region of
        the spectrum. </p>
      <p>Continuous researches for 18 months with plates of amalgamated
        tin proved to me that the sensitiveness of metals to light ---
        the time taken by them to lose the electric charge they have
        received --- varied not only with the hour of the day, but also
        with the season. The figures I first gave several years ago,
        having been taken in winter and very cold weather, were too low.
      </p>
      <p>The discharge is always less rapid in winter than in the
        summer, but during the same day it may vary in the proportion of
        1 to 4. It diminishes rapidly as the hours progress. For
        instance, on 9 August 1901 the discharge, which at 4:30 pm was
        50 degrees per minute, fell to 16° at 5:50. On the 24 August
        1901, the discharge, which was 80°/minute at 3:25 pm, fell to
        40° at 4:30 pm. For several days I followed, hour by hour, the
        variations of the leak, and drew up tables of them. There would
        be no interest in publishing them, for the differences do not
        depend on the hours, but mainly on the variations of the solar
        ultraviolet, which often disappears in part (from M, and even
        from L) under the influence, as I have already stated, of causes
        totally unknown. </p>
      <p>Clouds do not sensibly reduce the discharge, which remains
        about the same as in the shade. Nor does their presence
        noticeably reduce the solar ultraviolet, which I have been able
        to photograph through fairly thick clouds. </p>
      <p><i>Dissociation of the Atoms of Gases in the Extreme Region of
          the Ultraviolet ~</i> </p>
      <p>We have just seen that all bodies, simple or compound,
        conductors or insulators, subjected to the action of light
        undergo dissociation. But among none of the bodies examined up
        to now do gases appear. Are we to suppose that they escape the
        common law? </p>
      <p>This exception seemed improbable. Yet up to Lenard’s last
        researches the dissociation of gases by the action of light had
        not been observed. No doubt it was supposed that the discharge
        of electrified bodies, when struck by light, might be due to the
        action of the luminous rays in the air, but this hypothesis fell
        to the ground in face of these two facts --- first, that the
        discharge varies according to the metals, which would not be the
        fact if it were the air and not the metal which was acting; and
        second, that the discharge takes place still more rapidly in a
        vacuum than in the air. </p>
      <p>The reason of this apparent indifference of gases, air
        especially, to the light which strikes them is very simple. Some
        metals are dissociable only in a very advanced region of the
        ultraviolet. If gases should happen to be dissociable only in
        still more advanced regions, the observation of their
        dissociation must be difficult, seeing that the air with slight
        density is as opaque as lead for the radiations of the extreme
        ultraviolet. </p>
      <p>Now, as Lenard has shown (<i>Annalen der Physik</i>, Bd. 1,
        1900), it is solely inthis extreme region of the ultraviolet
        that what was then called the ionization of gases, which is no
        other than their dissociation, is possible. He saw that it
        sufficed to bring the bodies under experiment to within a dew
        centimeters from the source of light --- from the electric spark
        --- for the discharge to be the same for all bodies, which shows
        that it is then the air which becomes the conductor and acts. It
        is light, and no other cause, which intervenes, for the
        interposition of thin glass stops all effect. </p>
      <p>By a special arrangement, which there would be no advantage in
        describing here, Lenard has measured the wavelength of the
        radiations which produce the ionization of the air. They begin
        towards 0.180 microns, just at the limits of the electric
        spectrum as formerly known (0.185 microns), and extend as far as
        0.140 microns. The discovery of these short radiations is, as is
        known, due to Schuman. By creating a vacuum in a spectrograph,
        he proved that the ultraviolet spectrum, which, from the
        incorrect measurements of Cornu and Mascart, were believed to be
        limited to 0.185 microns, in reality extended much farther. He
        ahs succeeded in photographing rays reaching as far as
        0.100microns. It is probably the absorption exercised by the
        gelatin of the sensitive plates, and no doubt also by the
        material of the prism, which prevents further progress. </p>
      <p>As we advance into the ultraviolet spectrum, all bodies, the
        air especially, become more and more opaque to the radiations.
        It would therefore be very surprising if the x-rays, which pass
        through all bodies, were constituted by the extreme ultraviolet,
        as some physicists have maintained. </p>
      <p>Most bodies, including air of a thickness of 2 cm, and water 1
        mm thick, are, in fact, absolutely opaque for these radiations
        of very short wavelength. There are hardly any transparent to
        them except quartz, fluorspar, gypsum, and rock salt, and even
        these only on condition of their surface not being roughened.
        Pure hydrogen is equally transparent. </p>
      <p>The extremely refrangible radiations of light therefore
        dissociate, not only all solid bodies, but also the particles of
        the air they pass through, while radiations less refrangible
        possess no action on gases, and only dissociate the surface of
        the solid bodies they strike. These are two very different
        effects which may be superposed on each other, but which will
        not be confused if it be borne in mind that when it is the air
        that is decomposed, the nature of the metal struck and the state
        of its surface are points of no importance; while the leak
        varies considerably with the metal when it is the latter that
        becomes dissociated. Besides, the influence of the extreme
        ultraviolet can be almost entirely avoided by removing the
        source of light to a little distance, since a layer of air of 2
        cm suffices to stop this region of the spectrum. If, therefore,
        the sparks from the electrodes are at several centimeters from
        the quartz window of the spark-box, no effect due to the
        decomposition of the air can be produced. </p>
      <p>In comparing some of the experiments set forth so far, it will
        be noticed that those bodies which absorb most light are
        precisely those which are the most dissociable. For example,
        air, which absorbs the radiations below 0.185 microns, is
        decomposed by these radiations. Lamp-black, which completely
        absorbs light, is energetically dissociated by it, and
        disengages effluves in abundance. This explanation does not
        appear at first sight at all to tally with the fact that metals
        which have recently received a mirror polish are likewise the
        seat of an extremely abundant disengagement of effluves. The
        objection vanishes, however, when it is considered that polished
        metals which reflect visible light very well reflect very badly
        the invisible light of the ultraviolet extremity of the
        spectrum, and absorb the greater part of it. Now, it is
        precisely these absorbable and invisible radiations which
        produce most effect. </p>
      <p>To give a clear idea of the properties of the various pars of
        the ultraviolet spectrum, I will put them in tabular form. It
        shows that the aptness of light to dissociate bodies increases
        with every step into the ultraviolet. </p>
      <p><i>The Property of Dissociating Matter Possessed by the Various
          Parts of the Ultraviolet Spectrum:</i> </p>
      <p>0.400 - 0.344 microns --- These radiations pass through
        ordinary glass. They can only dissociate a small number of
        metals, and even then only if they have been recently cleaned. </p>
      <p>0.344 - 0.295 microns --- The uv of this region only passes
        through glass not thicker than 0.8 mm. After 0.295, it is
        completely absorbed by the atmosphere, and consequently plays no
        part in the solar spectrum. This region, though much more active
        than the preceding one, has still only a rather weak
        dissociating activity on most bodies. </p>
      <p>0.295 - 0.252 microns --- The uv of this region is not met with
        in the solar but only in the electric spectrum. It can only pass
        through glass plates not exceeding 0.1 mm thickness. Its
        dissociation action is much more intense and more general than
        that of the preceding region of the spectrum, but much less than
        that of the following region. It dissociates all solid bodies,
        but has no action on gases. </p>
      <p>0.252 - 0.100 microns --- This region of the uv is so little
        penetrating that air, as soon as the radiations of 0.185 are
        reached, is as opaque to it at a thickness of 2 cm as metal. A
        glass plate 0.1 mm thick stops this extreme uv absolutely. </p>
      <p>The dissociating power of this region is much greater than that
        of the other parts of the spectrum. Starting from 0.185 microns,
        it dissociates not only all solid bodies, metals, wood, etc.,
        but also the gases of the air on which the preceding region of
        the spectrum had no action. </p>
      <p>To sum up, the more we advance into the ultraviolet, the
        shorter the wavelength of the radiations become, the less
        penetration these radiations have; but their dissociating action
        on matter shows itself more and more energetically. At the
        extremity of the spectrum all bodies are dissociated, including
        gases, on which the other parts of the spectrum have no action.
        The dissociating action of the various luminous radiation is
        therefore in inverse ratio to their penetration (1). </p>
      <p>[(1) See Wm Ramsay and Dr Spencer, <i>Philosophical Magazine</i>,
        October 1906.] </p>
      <p>The law thus formulated was quite unforeseen previous to my
        researches. All earlier observations seemed to show that the
        rays at the ultraviolet end of the spectrum possessed so slight
        an energy as to be almost inappreciable by the most delicate
        thermometers. It is, however, these radiations which most
        quickly dissociate the most rigid bodies, such as steel, for
        example. </p>

      <i>General Action of the Gases of Flames on Electrified Bodies</i>
      ~
      <p>If feeble chemical reactions, such as a simple hydration, can,
        as we shall see later, provoke the dissociation of matter, it is
        conceivable that the phenomena of combustion which constitute
        intense chemical reactions must realize the maximum of
        dissociation. This is, in fact, what is observed in the gases of
        flames, and has led to the supposition that incandescent bodies
        give forth into the air emissions of the same family as the
        cathode rays. </p>
      <p>For at least a century it has been known that flames discharged
        electrified bodies, but no pains whatever were taken to search
        for the causes of this phenomenon, although it was one of
        primary importance. </p>
      <p>The first precise researches on this subject are due to Branly.
        It was he who pointed out that the active parts of flames are
        the gases emitted by them. He also studied the influence of
        temperature on the nature of the discharge. Using as a source of
        radiation a platinum wire made more or less red hot by an
        electric current, he noted that at a dark red the negative
        discharge was much higher than the positive discharge, while at
        a bright red heat the two discharges were equalized, which would
        seem to prove that at different temperatures ions are formed
        charged with different electricities. Figures 47 and 48 show
        modes of very easily proving the emission, during combustion, of
        particles with the power of rendering air a conductor of
        electricity. With a flame placed at 10 cm from the electroscope
        (Figure 47) a very rapid discharge (60 degrees in 30") is
        obtained). With an ordinary candle in a closed lantern with an
        elbowed chimney placed at 13 cm from the electroscope (Figure
        48) the discharge gives 18 degrees in 30". At 20 cm it falls to
        4 degrees. The extreme diffusion of the ions in the air explains
        these differences. </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="fig47.jpg" height="633" width="513"></p>
        <p><img src="fig48.jpg" height="483" width="475"></p>
      </center>
      <p>After passing through a long cooled tubular worm, according to
        the arrangement represented in another chapter (Figure 52), the
        gas from the flames still produce, though feebly, a discharge of
        the electroscope. </p>
      <p>I have already recalled to mind that the recent experiments of
        J. J. Thomson have shown that an incandescent body is a powerful
        and unlimited source of electrons --- that is, of particles
        identical with those of radioactive bodies. He has proved it by
        the fact that the relation between their electric charge and
        their mass is the same. The phenomena of combustion therefore
        constitute one of the most energetic causes of the dissociation
        of matter. They produce such an enormous quantity of effluves
        from dissociated matter that it is possible to hope that some
        means of utilizing them may be discovered. Meanwhile, these
        effluves diffuse themselves in the atmosphere, where they play
        some part not yet known to us. </p>
      <p><i>Properties of the Particles of Dissociated Matter Contained
          in Flames</i> ~ </p>
      <p>I have noticed in my experiments three curious facts which have
        not been pointed out before. The first is the property possessed
        by the elements of dissociated gas of traversing, in appearance
        at least, metallic receptacles; the second is the increasing
        rapidity of the discharge according to the thickness of the
        metal connected with the electroscope; the third is the loss
        rapidly undergone by several metals of the property of being
        influenced by the gases of flames. </p>
      <p>The electroscope is charged as directed in a former paragraph,
        and the lamp for the purpose of producing the dissociated gases
        is arranged as shown in Figure 49. Then there will be noticed a
        rather rapid discharge at the beginning of the experiment, which
        soon becomes slower and then stops. The metal does not regain
        its sensitiveness by being cleaned, but only after a prolonged
        repose of at least 24 hours. The figures below give an idea of
        the variations thus observed. The source of light was placed at
        such a distance as to obtain a rther slow discharge, so that the
        differences could be noted: </p>
      <p>Discharge during the first 3 minutes = 9° <br>
        During the next 3 minutes = 4° <br>
        During the following 3 minutes = 2° </p>

            <br>
            We shall see on interpreting this last phenomenon, that it
            is due to an emission of radio-active emanation analogous to
            that of radium, but very quickly exhausted and very slowly
            renewed.<br>

            showing the action of dissociated matter contained in the
            gases of flames on an electrified body contained in a metal
            cage. -The effect produced is as if the metal cage were
            rapidly transpierced by the dissociated matter. When it is
            desired to entirely eliminate the action of heat, the gases
            are made to pass through a worm 2 metres long immersed in a
            reservoir of water (Fig. 52). They then only reach the
            electroscope after complete cooling, and still produce a
            slight discharge. <br>
            <br>
            But a part of the discharge seems certainly produced by the
            transparency of the metal forming the Faraday's cage, since
            it manifests itself, though in a slight degree, with gases
            completely cooled so as to eliminate the action of heat.<br>
            <br>

            the extremity of the elbowed chimney of <br>

            the lamp at 2 or 3 centimetres from the cylinder forming the
            Faraday's cage to obtain a discharge of from 7° to 10° per
            minute. This continues for about ten minutes, and then stops
            entirely. It is useless to clean the cylinder; it must be
            allowed to rest for several days. The alteration is spread
            over the whole circumference of the cylinder and not solely
            on the part exposed to the gases of the flames. It is due, I
            repeat, to the emission of a radio-active matter similar to
            the emanation of radio-active bodies.¹ When working with
            gases cooled by their passage through a worm, as shown in
            Fig. 52, the discharge does not exceed 2° per minute, and
            appears in that case to be due to the transparency of the
            metal.<br>
            <br>
            ¹ It would be satisfactory to have this experiment checked
            by an independent observer. McLennan and Burton (Phil. Mag.,
            Sept 1903) have shown that if a cylinder of any metal is
            enclosed within a second one of the same material insulated
            from it and surrounded by air, it gradually acquires a
            negative charge. So C. T. R. Wilson (Proc. Roy. Soc., vol.
            69, pp. 55 et seq.) asserts that there is a continuous
            production of ions in air contained in a closed vessel, even
            when it is not exposed to any known ionizing agent. - F. L.<br>

            </b><b>EXPERIMENTS ON THE DISSOCIATION OF MATTER BY CHEMICAL
              REACTION.</b><b><br>
            </b><br>
            I have discovered a large number of chemical reactions
            producing the dissociation of matter. This is revealed by
            the characteristics which prove this dissociation - that is,
            the power of rendering the air a conductor of electricity,
            and in some cases of producing phosphorescence.<br>
            <br>
            To establish the fact of this dissociation, instead of
            working by the method shown in in Fig. 36, it is simpler in
            the case of merely qualitative experiments to place the body
            under study on the plate of the electroscope, which is then
            charged (Fig. 50).<br>
            <br>
            Here are a few examples of reactions accompanied by the
            dissociation of matter:--<br>
            <br>
            <b>Dissociation of Matter by the Hydration of certain Salts.
            </b>- Among the various reactions I formerly pointed out as
            accompanied by radio-activity is the hydration of sulphate
            of quinine. This body, as has long been known, becomes
            phosphorescent by the action of heat; but what was not
            known, is that when it has lost its phosphorescence after
            sufficient heating, it suddenly becomes brightly luminous
            and at the same time radio-active on cooling. After
            searching for the cause of these two phenomena I found that
            they were due to a very slight hydration. The radio-activity
            only manifests itself at the beginning of the hydration and
            lasts but a few minutes. The phosphorescence, on the <br>
            <br>
            <b>Page 384</b><b><br>
            </b><br>
            other hand, persists for a quarter of an hour.<br>
            <br>
            This property of sulphate of quinine - viz., that of
            becoming phosphorescent by cooling - is quite contrary to
            what is observed in the many other phosphorescent bodies
            which never phosphoresce as they cool.<br>
            <br>
            In order to realize the experiments of phosphorescence by
            refrigeration and radio-activity in sulphate of quinine, it
            should be heated to 125°C. on a metal plate till all
            phosphorescence has completely disappeared. When removed
            from the plate on which it was heated, the sulphate of
            quinine again becomes phosphorescent as it cools, and,
            placed at once on the plate of the electroscope, gives for
            three or four minutes an abundant disengagement of effluves,
            which cause the leaves of the instrument to collapse (12°
            during the first minute, 4° in the second). The amount
            employed in my experiments was about 2 grammes of sulphate
            of quinine. The cessation of the phosphorescence occurs long
            before the disappearance of the discharge. The two phenomena
            are therefore independent of each other.<br>

        <p align="left"><font size="+1"><b>Fig. 50. -- Study of the
              Dissociation of Matter by Chemical Reactions.</b> - The
            bodies capable of producing the dissociation of matter by
            their reactions are introduced into the receiver placed on
            the plate of the electroscope; this latter is then charged
            and its discharge watched. This arrangement is much more
            simple than the classic method indicated in Fig. 36, and
            gives as good results when quantitative ones are not
            required.<br>

            Page 385<br>
            <br>
            From the measurements kindly made for me by M. Duboin,
            Professor of Chemistry at the Faculté des Sciences of
            Grenoble, the absorption of 1 miligramme of water vapour is
            sufficient to render phosphorescent and radio-active 1
            gramme of dried sulphate of quinine.<br>
            <br>
            The foregoing experiment can be repeated indefinitely. When
            the sulphate of quinine is hydrated it simply has to be
            heated anew. It becomes phosphorescent by heat, is
            extinguished, and shines afresh and becomes radio-active in
            the course of cooling by hydration. Since hydration and
            dehydration are the causes of the phosphorescence of
            sulphate of quinine, we can, by causing it to be hydrated or
            dehydrated by means other than heat, obtain the same
            phosphorescence. Introduce into a wide-mouthed bottle some
            sulphate of quinine with a little anhydrous phosphoric acid,
            and cork the bottle. The phosphoric acid will at once
            deprive the sulphate of quinine of its moisture. One has
            only to open the bottle and blow into the interior to see
            the sulphate of quinine become quickly phosphorescent. On
            closing the bottle again the salt of quinine dehydrates
            itself anew, and the same operation can be repeated numbers
            of times.<br>
            <br>
            Sulphate of cinchona gives the same results as sulphate of
            quinine, but the phenomena, especially that of
            phosphorescence, are less intense.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Dissociation of Matter during the Formation of various
              Gases.--</b>Among the great number of reactions producing
            dissociation of matter I will also cite the following:--<br>
            <br>
            Page 386<br>
            <br>
            Formation of oxygen by the decomposition of oxygenated water
            by means of dioxide of manganese. -- The products are placed
            in the metal capsule on the plate, which is then charged
            (Fig. 50). The reaction lasts a little over a minute. The
            leak of the electroscope is about 9°.<br>
            <br>
            Formation of hydrogen by the decomposition of water by means
            of the sodium amalgam. -- Operation as before. Loss, 9° per
            minute. The discharge is exactly the same whether the
            electroscope be charged positively or negatively. The
            decomposition of water by sulphuric acid and zinc gives the
            same results.<br>
            <br>
            Formation of acetylene by the action of water on carbide of
            calcium. -- The same operation. Loss, 11° per minute.<br>
            <br>
            Formation of ozone .-- Air charged with ozone by means of a
            large coil and an ozonizer is directed by a bellows on to
            the plate of the electroscope. The loss is very slight,
            hardly 1° per minute, if the instrument be charged
            negatively, and 4° if charged positively.<br>
            <br>
            It would be tedious to multiply these examples. The
            dissociation of matter is observed in many reactions, and
            especially in hydrations. Oxidations, even the most
            energetic (oxidation of sodium in moist air, for instance),
            have generally little or no action.<br>
            <br>
            To close this branch of the subject I will merely cite the
            dissociation of matter during the oxidation of phosphorus.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Dissociation of Matter during the Oxidation of
              Phosphorus.</b>--Phosphorus is one of the bodies with the
            most intense radio-activity. To prove this, phosphorus may
            be rubbed with a damp leather, then placed on the
            electroscope and a discharge of 80° per minute (calculated
            on the loss in 20 seconds) will be observed, whatever be the
            sign of the charge. The amount used is 1 centigramme of
            phosphorus. When the leather becomes dry the discharge stops
            almost entirely. Red phosphorus and sesquisulphide of
            phosphorus have no action.<br>
            <br>
            The phosphorescence of phosphorus is due to causes as yet
            not clearly defined, which do not seem to be confined solely
            to oxidation and hydration. By very carefully drying the
            phosphorus by <br>

            <br>
            means of the apparatus (Fig. 51), the phosphorescence is
            extremely slight, while it becomes very vivid under the
            influence of a trace of water vapour.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Fig. 51.--Apparatus of Gustave Le Bon and Martin, used
              for determining the part played by water vapour in the
              phosphorescence of phosphorus</b>.--The two compartments A
            and B being supplied with anhydrous phosphoric acid,
            phosphorus is introduced into A, then A and B are separated
            by tightening the screw V. The phosphorus absorbs the oxygen
            of A, shines and then becomes extinguished. The screw V is
            then loosened and the dry air from B penetrates into A. One
            observes only a very slight phosphorescence, confined to the
            surface of the piece of phosphorus. If then, by means of the
            funnel represented in the figure, a drop of water is allowed
            to fall into B, the small quantity of vapour it emits is
            enough to render the phosphorus much more brilliant and
            there will form round it a luminous cloud. Water vapour
            therefore plays a manifest part in phosphorescence.<br>
            <br>
            The numerous memoirs published during the last century on
            this question have not yet elucidated the causes of the
            phosphorescence of phosphorus. Several authors assert that
            the phosphorescence will be maintained in a current of pure
            hydrogen carefully freed from all trace of oxygen, but I
            have <br>
            <br>
            page 388<br>
            <br>
            never observed anything of the kind in my experiments. The
            presence of air has always appeared indispensable.<br>
            <br>
            The experiments I carried out with the co-operation of M.
            Martin, engineer to the great phosphorus works at Lyons,
            have given the following results:--<br>
            <br>
            1st. In the barometrical vacuum phosphorus is never
            phosphorescent.<br>
            <br>
            2nd. In an atmosphere of carbonic acid gas, dry or saturated
            with water vapour, phosphorus does not shine. If into the
            globe of carbonic acid gas containing phosphorus a simple
            bubble of air be introduced, this bubble becomes
            instantaneously phosphorescent.<br>
            <br>
            3rd. Phosphorescence in moist air is not accompanied by the
            production of phosphuretted hydrogen.<br>
            <br>
            4th. During phosphorescence there is a production of ozone
            revealed by the blue coloration of iodine paper. To remove
            all doubts as to its presence, we deprived the air of the
            ozone it might normally contain, by passing it through two
            bottles, one containing mercury, the other protochloride of
            zinc. Thus deprived of its natural ozone, as is evident by
            the absence of any coloration of the iodine paper, the air
            comes to phosphorus which has been dried at 200°C. in a
            current of carbonic acid gas. The iodine paper becomes quite
            blue as soon as the air has passed through the globe
            containing the phosphorus. This latter has therefore the
            property of transforming the oxygen of the air into ozone.<br>
            <br>
            In a recent study effected at Professor J. J. Thomson's
            laboratory, which was published in the Philosophical
            Magazine of April 1905, under the title of "Radio-activity
            and Chemical Change," Mr. Norman Campbell contests my
            conclusions on radio-activity from chemical reactions. He
            does not deny the discharge observed on the electroscope,
            but he attributes it to the action of the heat <br>
            <br>
            Page 389<br>
            <br>
            produced by various reactions. He admits, however, being
            unable to explain how heat can produce the leak of
            electricity observed.¹<br>
            <br>
            I have never dreamed of disputing the influence of heat, of
            which I have explained the effects by showing that it acted
            by expelling the provision of radio-activity which the
            bodies contain; but it is very evident that its intervention
            cannot be claimed in chemical reactions which are
            unaccompanied by any rise in temperature, such as the
            hydration of sulphate of quinine during cooling, the
            oxidation of phosphorus, etc. On the other hand, there are
            reactions accompanied by a rise in temperature, such as the
            oxidation of sodium, which produce no radio-activity. The
            influence of heat and that of chemical reactions constitute
            two factors whose action is very distinct though at times
            they may be superposed.<br>

            </b><b>EXPERIMENTS ON THE CAUSE OF THE DISSOCIATION OF
              SPONTANEOUSLY RADIO-ACTIVE BODIES.</b><br>
            <br>
            The experiments which follow were made at the outset of the
            discovery of the radio-active bodies in order to prove that
            their dissociation, contrary to the opinion then current,
            depended upon certain chemical reactions of a nature unknown
            indeed, but resembling those which produce phosphorescence.<br>
            <br>
            The phenomena of radio-activity -- that is, the emission of
            effluves -- obtained with uranium, thorium, and radium, are
            very noticeably modified by heat and moisture. Prolonged
            heat at first excites radio-activity, which increases very
            much for a time but can then no longer be brought back to
            its primitive state excepting after long repose. As to
            hydration, it suppresses phosphorescence and diminishes
            radio-activity.<br>
            <br>
            The diminution of the action on the electroscope by
            hydration varies greatly with the substances employed. I
            give the figures obtained with divers radio-active
            substances, first dried at 200°C., then pounded and mixed
            with their own weight in water --<br>

            <br>
            I should add that if the water acts chemically, it at the
            same time acts partly by the absorption of a part of the
            emitted particles--that is to say, like a screen.<br>
            <br>
            Wetted, or simply exposed to moisture, radio-active bodies
            lose all phosphorescence, which is not at all the case with
            ordinary phosphorescent bodies, and they only regain it when
            brought to a white heat.<br>
            <br>
            Temperature also plays a considerable part in the
            phosphorescence of radio-active bodies. It suffices to heat
            salts of radium, to cause them to momentarily lose their
            phosphorescence. The necessary temperature varies according
            to the samples, which are evidently of a very variable
            composition. Some among them require a temperature of
            500°C., and the phosphorescence reappears so soon as the
            body cools. For other samples, a temperature of 225°C. is
            sufficient, and the body does not regain its phosphorescence
            when becoming cool, but only after some hours, and sometimes
            even only after a few days.<br>
            <br>
            The preceding considerations deduced from the actions of
            heat and moisture apart, the following experiment would seem
            to indicate the existence of those new chemical combinations
            which I have examined elsewhere, combinations in which one
            of the elements is in an infinitesimal proportion compared
            with the other.<br>
            <br>
            After having determined the radio-activity of 30 grammes of
            chloride of thorium--which spread out on a metal receptacle
            10 cm. square, and placed on the electroscope, give 9° of
            discharge per minute--we dissolve them in water, adding 1
            gramme of chloride of barium, a body which possesses no
            radio-activity, and we precipitate the chloride in the state
            of sulphate by the addition of a small quantity of sulphuric
            acid. The product, weighing about 7 decigrammes, is
            collected in a filter. These 7 decigrammes placed on the
            plate of the electroscope give 16° of discharge, when the
            utmost that <br>
            <br>
            Page 392<br>
            <br>
            should be obtained is 9°, since the activity extracted from
            the chloride of thorium cannot be greater than that which
            was found therein at first, if it is not a case of chemical
            reaction. The chloride of thorium remaining has only lost
            the half of its activity.<br>
            <br>
            I must point out, however, that no measurements of the
            radio-activity of bodies by the electroscope have any very
            precise quantitative value. I only draw conclusions from
            them with reserve, since I have noticed the extreme
            influence of the greater or less degree of division of the
            matter treated. I said above that the 7 decigrammes of
            precipitated matter had given 16° of discharge, but the
            filter used, which no longer contained anything, unless it
            were the very fine fine matter adhering to its rims, gave
            40° of discharge per minute on the electroscope. Yet it only
            contained at the most a few millegrammes of matter, though
            spread over a large surface.<br>
            <br>
            Still more simply can be shown the influence of the division
            of matter on its radio-activity by the following
            experiment:-- 1 gramme of pure chloride of thorium is spread
            in powder on the plate of the electroscope and gives a
            discharge of 1° per minute. We dissolve this powder in 2 cm.
            cube of distilled water, and in this solution dip a piece of
            filtering paper 10 cm. square; we dry it and place it on the
            plate of the electroscope. The discharge rises to 70 per
            minute --that is, 7 times more than with the same product in
            fine and dry powder. When the same sheet of paper is folded
            over so as to reduce its surface, the discharge falls to 3
            degrees.<br>
            <br>
            The same phenomena are observed with uranium. Place on the
            electroscope a small block of metallic uranium weighing some
            30 grammes. It gives 12° of discharge in 10 minutes. Take a
            third of the same block -- that is, 10 grammes -- reduce it
            to powder, and spread it over a metal receptacle 10 <br>
            <br>
            Page 393<br>
            <br>
            cm. square placed on the plate of the electroscope. The
            discharge rises to about 28° in ten minutes. So, by the fact
            alone of increasing the surface of the radio-active body, a
            quantity of the same substance three times less, gives a
            discharge twice as great. The discharge which radio-active
            bodies produce is therefore reduced in large proportions by
            diminishing the surface.<br>
            <br>
            This reduction is not, however, proportional to the surface.
            As soon as the layer of a radio-active body attains a
            certain thickness, fresh additions, which only increase this
            thickness, have no effect. It appears as if these bodies
            were capable of absorbing the radiations they themselves
            emit.<br>
            <br>
            50 or 25 grammes of thorium, spread thinly on a receptacle
            of the same dimensions (12×17 cm.) as before, so as to cover
            it entirely, give exactly the same discharge (12° per
            minute).<br>
            <br>
            These same quantities (50 grammes or 25 grammes) placed in a
            smaller receptacle, will only give a discharge of 7° per
            minute.<br>

            </b><b>EXPERIMENTS ON THE IONIZATION OF GASES.</b><b><br>
            </b><br>
            It was in gases that the dissociation of simple bodies was
            first observed, and that at a time when one hardly thought
            of speaking about the dissociation of atoms. The phenomenon
            was then called by the name of ionization. This term, in
            reality, should be considered as absolutely synonymous with
            that of dissociation of matter, as I have already stated.<br>
            <br>
            The products of the dissociation of the atoms of gases are
            of the same nature as those attained by the dissociation of
            other bodies, such as metals. The relation of their electric
            charge to their mass is always the same. Their properties
            only vary, as explained elsewhere, according to whether the
            ionization takes place under ordinary pressure or in a very
            rarefied gas in that of a Crookes' tube.<br>
            <br>
            Ionizing a gas, or, in other words, dissociating it,
            consists in withdrawing from its atoms those elements known
            by the name of ions, some bearing a positive, others a
            negative charge.<br>
            <br>
            These ions of contrary signs are always equivalent in
            number, so that, as J. J. Thomson has remarked, the mass of
            the ionized gas, taken as a whole, betrays no electric
            charge. This statement is, besides, in conformity with all
            our knowledge of electricity. It is impossible to produce an
            electric charge of one sign without creating at the same
            time an exactly equal charge of the other sign. When, for
            instance, an electric fluid is decomposed by friction, each
            of the two bodies employed <br>

              properties of gases dissociated by flames. -</b>- The ions
            produced in this form of the dissociation of matter
            neutralize each other with extreme slowness, since they can
            pass through a long metal worm and discharge the
            electroscope at the other end.<br>

            <br>
            contains a quantity of electricity strictly equal to that of
            the other, but of contrary sign.<br>
            <br>
            An ionized gas, therefore, taken as a whole reveals no sign
            of electricity, but if it be directed between two parallel
            electric plates, one charged with positive the other with
            negative electricity, the ions of contrary signs are
            attracted by one or other of the two plates, and the
            neutralization of a part of the charge of the plates can be
            verified by means of an electrmeter.<br>
            <br>
            What becomes of the positive and negative ions formed in a
            gaseous mass? An ionized gas preserves its conductivity for
            some time, but it does not keep it for ever, and at last it
            becomes impossible to detect in it any electric charge. The
            conclusion is that the positive and negative ions have
            recombined to form neutral electricity.¹<br>
            <br>
            ¹ See on this subject the researches of Mr. Kleeman, Phil.
            Mag., April and October 1906. -- F. L.<br>
            <br>
            The rapidity of recombination of the ions appears to be
            proportional to the number of ions present, and that is why,
            in gases ionized by very active bodies, such as radium, it
            is very rapid. The recombination of ions is rendered much
            more rapid by the presence of solid particles, as may be
            verified by blowing tobacco smoke between two metallic
            plates charged with electricity, with an ionized gas passing
            between them.<br>
            <br>
            It is generally supposed at the present day that all ions,
            whatever their origin, are alike, and this opinion is
            especially founded on the sameness of their electric charge.
            My experiments have led me to suppose, on the contrary, that
            the various ions ought to exhibit notable differences among
            themselves. I have observed, in fact, that the rapidity of
            their recombination, or rather, of their <br>

            Page 397<br>
            <br>
            disappearance -- not to prejudge anything -- varies greatly
            with their origin. Here are, for instance, three cases in
            which, from my researches, ions behave very differently: --<br>
            <br>
            1st. Ions produced by combustion. -- These can pass through
            a cooled metallic tube, 2 metres long, as is shown by the
            action they exercise on an electroscope placed at the
            extremity of this tube (Fig. 52), but a very thin layer of
            water stops them.<br>
            <br>
            2nd. Ions produced by certain chemical reactions. -- Of
            these reactions I shall only mention the formation of
            hydrogen by the action of sodium amalgam or water. The ions
            obtained almost entirely disappear after passing through a
            few centimetres of the tube (Fig. 53).<br>

            contrary to what is observed in the experiment in Fig. 52,
            almost nil. For this reason it is preferable to make use of
            the arrangement represented in Fig. 50, for studying the
            dissociation of matter by chemical reactions.<br>

            the electroscope that all the ions have not been retained by
            the <br>

            previous operations.<br>
            <br>
            It will be seen by these three examples that ions may show
            real differences among themselves notwithstanding their
            indisputable analogies.<br>
            <br>
            The quantity of gaseous molecules capable of being ionized
            in a given mass of gas is relatively very small, however
            energetic may be the process of ionization employed. Were it
            otherwise, it would be easy to extract from atoms a colossal
            amount of energy. Rutherford calculates the number of
            molecules dissociated, or rather, having undergone a
            commencement of dissociation, at 1 in 100,000,000. This
            figure is arrived at in various ways, notably by verifying
            the number of drops of water which result from the
            condensation of water vapour produced by the presence of
            ions. Though this figure may appear insignificant, the
            number of ions is still considerable by reason of the number
            of particles contained in a gas, which is estimated at
            36,000 billions per millimetre cube. The cubic millimetre of
            a gas might therefore contain 360 million particles having
            undergone a commencement of dissociation, although only one
            molecule in a hundred millions might be partly dissociated.<br>

            </b><b>EXPERIMENTS ON THE SPONTANEOUS DISSOCIATION OF MATTER
              AND ON THE EXISTENCE IN ALL BODIES OF AN EMANATION
              ANALOGOUS TO THAT OF THE RADIO-ACTIVE SUBSTANCES.</b><b><br>
            </b><br>
            The concatenation of my experiments led me to discover the
            existence in all bodies of an emanation similar to that of
            the radio-active substances, which shows that all bodies
            dissociate spontaneously. This is how I was led to this
            demonstration.<br>
            <br>
            With the object of studying the transparency of metals to
            particles of dissociated matter, whether by light or
            combustion, I made use of the condensing electroscope
            previously described -- of an electroscope enclosed in a
            Faraday's cage, and I noticed an important discharge under
            the influence of a heat slight enough to raise the
            temperature of its walls by only some 30°.<br>
            <br>
            The first explanation obviously was that the metal cylinder
            was transparent to radiations.<br>
            <br>
            I now give the experiments that showed me that the principal
            cause of the phenomenon was not due to any transparency, but
            to an emanation from the metal identical with that observed
            in radio-active bodies, such as thorium, uranium, etc.,
            which, some time after my researches (published in the Revue
            Scientifique, 22nd November 1902, p. 650), J. J. Thomson
            discovered in all bodies.¹<br>
            <br>
            ¹ As mentioned in an earlier note, Professor J. J. Thomson
            does not admit this. He claims, on the contrary, that the
            emanation proved by him to exist in Cambridge tap-water and
            some other bodies may be due to the admixture of some
            radio-active substance. The alternative explanation of
            Elster and Geitel that all nature is exposed to the
            bombardment of a radiation from some unknown source, to
            which only rock-salt is impenetrable, should be borne in
            mind. (See their communication in Physikalische Zeitschrift,
            10th October 1905.) -- F. L.<br>
            <br>
            Let us again take in hand the apparatus (Fig. 49), which
            will enable us to verify the following facts:--<br>
            <br>
            Page 400<br>
            <br>
            If the discharge takes place from the exposure of the
            instrument to the sun, it is only noticeable if the
            temperature of the sun is high enough to heat the metal.<br>
            <br>
            With the ultra-violet light of electric sparks, so much more
            active than solar light, but which does not heat metal, the
            discharge is almost nil.<br>
            <br>
            In arranging the apparatus as shown in Fig. 49 for studying
            the action of heat, it will be found that after repeating
            the experiment five or six times, the metal, which at first
            gave a discharge of some 10°a minute, soon gives a very
            small one, then none at all, and only regains its properties
            at the end of a few days.¹<br>
            <br>
            ¹ This is confirmed by Sir William Ramsay's experiments
            referred to above (p. 376). The explanation he gives of the
            phenomenon differs from that in the text. --F. L.<br>
            <br>
            If, when a cylinder is very active under the influence of
            the heat of the gases of the flame, the lantern be
            withdrawn, the discharge continues for two or three minutes,
            as if the interior of the cylinder contained something able
            to neutralize a certain quantity of the electricity with
            which the electroscope is charged.<br>
            <br>
            The action produced by heat can be easily separated from
            that due to the transparency of the metal to particles of
            dissociated matter. The action of ionized gases and that of
            heat are two independent effects which are superposed, but
            which it is possible to separate. A slight increase in
            temperature produces a fairly strong discharge. Gases cooled
            by their passage through a long worm produce on the contrary
            but a slight discharge. The metal, in this last case, acts
            as if it were transparent. The walls of the Faraday's cage
            employed in this last experiment were only 0.2 mm.&nbsp;
            thick.<br>
            <br>
            Page 401<br>
            <br>
            It is possible even without the action of heat to verify in
            ordinary bodies the existence of a constant emanation from
            dissociated matter, though this emanation is extremely small
            in quantity.<br>
            <br>
            To cause it to be apparent, it is necessary to compel it to
            accumulate in a restricted space. It is sufficient for this
            to fold a sheet of metal so as to transform it into a small
            cylinder similar to the one which encloses the ball of the
            condensing electroscope. The lower opening is then closed
            and it is left for eight days in darkness, and then -- still
            keeping it in darkness so as to avoid any possible influence
            from light -- it is placed on the insulating disc of the
            electroscope to examine its radio-activity. It will then be
            found, after having charged the whole system exactly as I
            have directed, that a discharge of 1 to 2° per minute is
            obtained. As the metal rapidly loses that which it has
            accumulated, the discharge soon ceases. Many bodies other
            than metals, a box-wood cylinder especially, produce the
            same effect.<br>
            <br>
            The metal, after ceasing to act on the electroscope, has not
            on that account exhausted its provision of radio-activity.
            It has simply parted with the quantity it can emit at the
            particular temperature at which the operation was effected.
            But, as with phosphorescent bodies or radio-active matter,
            it only has to be slightly heated to cause it to again yield
            a more considerable emission of active effluves. To produce
            this, simply proceed exactly as indicated in Fig. 49, but to
            avoid certain objections, replace the lantern containing a
            candle by a small mass of metal heated to 400°C. -- that is,
            at less than red heat, and placed at 3 cm. from the
            Faraday's cage. Though the walls of the latter only become
            heated heated by radiation to about 35°C., it is sufficient
            to give a discharge of 5 or 6 degrees per minute. This
            discharge lasts 2 or 3 minutes, and stops when the metal has
            exhausted all <br>
            <br>
            Page 402<br>
            <br>
            its provision of radio-activity. It can afterwards regain
            this only by repose.<br>
            <br>
            It will be seen in all the preceding experiments that things
            occur just as if the metal contained a limited provision of
            something -- acting exactly in the same way as the emanation
            of radio-active bodies -- which it can emit rapidly under
            the influence of heat, but can then only recuperate by
            repose.<br>
            <br>
            This theory of the disengagement, under the influence of
            heat, of effluves of particles of dissociated matter, the
            elements of which are slowly reformed by repose, has the
            advantage of assimilating all bodies to the substances
            called radio-active like thorium and radium, which seemed to
            constitute strange exceptions to ordinary rules. The only
            difference is that the emanations of the latter reconstitute
            themselves as fast as the loss occurs. In ordinary metals,
            on the contrary, the loss is only very slowly repaired,
            whence arises the necessity of allowing the metal a certain
            length of rest.<br>
            <br>
            These experiments in any case prove clearly the phenomenon
            of the spontaneous dissociation of matter. I repeat that J.
            J. Thomson arrived later at the same conclusion by a
            different method.¹<br>
            <br>
            Radio-activity is then an absolutely general phenomenon
            whose study will certainly lead to important practical
            results.² It is already considered that the hitherto
            inexplicable action of certain mineral waters may be due to
            their radio-activity. This radio-activity would seem to show
            that the interior of the globe is the seat of
            disintegrations of matter which are perhaps not unconnected
            with earthquakes in view of the immense energy which matter
            may liberate by its dissociation.<br>

            </b><b>EXPERIMENTS ON THE ABSENCE OF RADIO-ACTIVITY IN VERY
              FINELY DIVIDED BODIES.</b><b><br>
            </b><br>
            The division of matter, however far it may be carried, does
            not produce any effects like those of its dissociation. This
            seemed evident a priori, but it was useful to verify it by
            experiment.<br>
            <br>
            The finest state of division in which matter is known to us
            seems to be that in which bodies emit odours. The olfactory
            sense is in that case much more sensitive than the balance
            of the chemist, since small quantities of odoriferous matter
            can perfume for a long time several cubic metres of air
            without any sensible loss of weight.<br>
            <br>
            However divided these particles may be, they have none of
            the properties of matter in a state of dissociation, and,
            consequently, do not render the air a conductor of
            electricity. I have experimented on the most odoriferous
            bodies I could find -- iodoform, vanilla, and artificial
            musk especially. All one has to do is simply to introduce
            them into a metal receptacle placed on the plate of
            electroscope. The latter is then charged, first positively,
            and then negatively. It is found that in both cases the
            discharge is nil.<br>
            <br>
            The particles which these bodies give off represent then a
            state of simple division, and in nowise a dissociation of
            matter. Ordinary matter, however divided it may be supposed
            to be, cannot be confused with matter whose atoms are
            dissociated. Vaporization or pulverization, which does not
            affect the atom, cannot produce the same effects as its
            dissociation.<br>

            magnesium, and aluminium, elements which in a normal state
            can form no combinations among themselves. By subjecting
            them to certain conditions of shock or pressure, we shall
            compel them to form admixtures in which one of the elements

            <br>
            We will now examine in detail the transformations we have
            just briefly indicated. I give first the modus operandi of
            these transformations: --<br>
            <br>
            <b>Transformation of the Properties of Mercury.</b> -- If a
            fragment of magnesium be placed in a bath of mercury the
            contact of the two metals may be maintained for any lapse of
            time without their combining. If roughly shaken in a bottle
            the magnesium is still unattacked. In their ordinary state,
            then, these metals refuse to combine, but we shall see that
            we have only to modify their usual physical conditions very
            slightly to enable them to join in very unequal proportions.<br>
            <br>
            To compel the mercury to dissolve a small quantity of
            magnesium, the intervention of a slight pressure alone is
            needed. This pressure constitutes one of those causes
            peculiar to the effect required, one of those appropriate
            reagents, of which I have several times pointed out the
            importance in this work.<br>
            <br>
            Page 406<br>
            <br>
            This pressure may be light but it must be continuous. To
            obtain it we have only to fill a tube with mercury and to
            close it with a cork having a strip of magnesium, carefully
            cleaned with emery-paper, passed through it (Fig. 54). By
            thus stopping the tube with the cork, the magnesium remains
            dipped in the mercury without being able to float on its
            surface. Subjected to this feeble pressure it is slightly
            attacked in a length of time varying from a few minutes to a
            few hours, according to the quality of the metal and the
            perfection of the cleaning. The properties of the mercury
            then become profoundly modified. It acquires the property,
            as curious as it was unexpected, of appearing to oxidize
            rapidly in dry air, and it vigorously decomposes water so
            soon as it is immersed in it (Fig. 55).</font></p>

            To verify the apparent dry oxidation of the mercury it only
            has to be poured into a recently cleaned glass. Its surface
            is then instantaneously covered with a black powder which
            forms again every time it is wiped away. If not removed, the
            coating of oxide soon reaches the thickness of a centimetre.
            This permanent oxidation continues for an hour.<br>
            <br>
            The oxidation of the mercury is, however, only apparent. It
            is not in reality the mercury which <br>
            <br>
            Page 407<br>
            <br>
            oxidizes, but the traces of magnesium contained in it. By
            oxidizing, the magnesium transforms the mercury into an
            impalpable black powder of considerable volume.<br>
            <br>
            To verify the decomposition of water by the mercury, it is
            poured into a glassful of this liquid as soon as the
            magnesium is taken out of it. The decomposition of the water
            is immediate. It becomes slower at the end of fifteen
            minutes, but lasts over an hour.<br>
            <br>
            The modified mercury rapidly loses its properties when
            exposed to the air, but it may be kept indefinitely and
            retains its new properties by covering it with a thin layer
            of oil or vaseline.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Transformation of the Properties of Magnesium </b>-- If,
            in the last experiment, instead of a thin fragment of
            magnesium being placed in the mercury under pressure, a
            strip of a certain thickness -- one millimetre, for instance
            -- be introduced, it will be found, by taking out this strip
            at the expiration of two or three hours and plunging it into
            water, that the liquid is rapidly decomposed (Fig. 56). The
            hydrogen of the water is disengaged, and the oxygen combines
            with the metal to form magnesia. The operation lasts about
            an hour, and as in the case of mercury, at last stops. If,
            after having immersed the magnesium in water, it is
            withdrawn, its temperature rises considerably and it
            oxidizes in the air.<br>

            This oxidation of magnesium in the air is -- contrary to
            what was observed with mercury, and contrary to what will be
            observed in aluminium -- very slight and only shows itself
            when the metal is wet. Withdrawn from the mercury and dried
            at once with a dry cloth, it does not oxidize, but retains <br>

            In the preceding experiments I have worked without the
            intervention of any reagent, simply by putting in presence
            of each other two metals which will not combine in the
            ordinary way, but which I have compelled to interpenetrate
            by the action of slight pressure. The operation requires
            several hours. It will only require a few seconds if I call
            in a reagent which by the sole fact that it attacks
            magnesium will diminish its resistance to the action of
            mercury.<br>
            <br>
            I now introduce into a large bottle a few centimetres cube
            of mercury, a strip of magnesium, and water containing 1% of
            hydrochloric acid, and roughly shake the bottle for 10
            seconds. I now withdraw the magnesium, wash it to quickly
            remove all traces of hydrochloric acid, dry it and throw it
            into a precipitating glass full of water. It will at once
            decompose this liquid. Taken from the bottle and poured into
            a glass full of water the mercury will likewise decompose
            that.<br>

            </b><b>Transformation of the Properties of Aluminium.</b> --
            The experiments with aluminium are much more striking than
            those effected with magnesium.<br>
            <br>
            To generate immediately on the polished surface of an
            aluminium mirror a vegetation in thick tufts as white as
            snow, constitutes one of the most curious experiments in
            chemistry, and one of those which has most struck the
            learned persons to whom I have shown it. Its realization is
            very simple.<br>
            <br>
            It is possible, as with magnesium, to compel the mercury to
            act under pressure, but the action of impact is much more
            rapid.<br>
            <br>
            It is sufficient to introduce into a bottle containing a few
            centimetres cube of mercury some strips of aluminium
            polished with rouge or simply cleaned with emery, and then
            to roughly shake the <br>
            <br>
            Page 409<br>
            <br>
            bottle for two minutes.¹ If one of the strips then be taken
            out, carefully wiped, and vertically placed on a support, it
            will be seen to be almost instantaneously covered with white
            tufts of alumina, which in a few minutes grow to a height of
            1 centimetre from the surface (Figs. 57 to 60). At the
            commencement of the experiment the temperature of the strip
            rises to 102°C.<br>
            <br>
            ¹ All the figures given by me in this book must be very
            exactly followed by any one wishing to repeat my
            experiments. The repeated shocks produced by the shaking
            tend to generate combinations which do not occur otherwise.
            It was by shaking a bottle containing ethylene and sulphuric
            acid some 3000 times that M. Berthelot, as is well known,
            obtained the synthesis of alcohol.<br>

            The above oxidation does not manifest itself if the
            aluminium be introduced into air or oxygen completely dry.
            The presence of a small quantity of water vapour is
            therefore indispensable for the production of the
            phenomenon. The alumina formed is, besides, always hydrated.<br>

            into alumina. This operation only ceases when the aluminium
            is entirely destroyed, a complete destruction which never
            occurs with magnesium. A strip of aluminium 1 millimetre in
            thickness, 1 centimetre in width, and 10 centimetres in
            length is entirely destroyed by oxidation in less than
            forty-eight hours.</font></p>

          <font size="+1"><b>Fig. 61. --</b> Arrangement of the
            experiment which allows us to give to a strip of aluminium,
            after its extremity has touched mercury, the property of
            decomposing water, and of transforming itself entirely into
            alumina, even when the mercury is withdrawn after the
            decomposition of the water has commenced.<br>
            <br>
            As with the transformed mercury, it is easy to preserve
            indefinitely in the modified aluminium all its properties by
            simply immersing it in a bottle of oil of vaseline.<br>
            <br>
            An idea of the minute quantity of mercury necessary to
            transform in so great a degree the properties of aluminium
            may be gathered by putting into a precipitating glass filled
            with distilled water, but containing a small quantity of
            mercury, a strip of aluminium cleaned with emery and fixed
            in a cork, so that it can only touch the mercury with its
            lower extremity (Fig. 61). After a few hours the water
            begins to decompose, and this decomposition, even after the
            mercury has been taken away, continues till the strip has
            been eaten away for a length of 5 to 6 centimètres above the
            point in contact with the mercury.<br>
            <br>
            In this experiment the action of the mercury has thus
            extended far beyond the part in contact with it. It may
            therefore be supposed that the mercury has travelled along
            the strip of aluminium by <br>
            <br>
            Page 411<br>
            <br>
            an electro-capillary phenomenon. The following experiment is
            free from this objection, and shows even more clearly the
            slight quantity of mercury necessary to transform the
            properties of aluminium.<br>
            <br>
            Into a dry and very clean bottle is put a small quantity of
            pure distilled mercury; the bottle is shaken for one minute,
            then the mercury is poured out so that there remains no
            visible trace of it on its sides, which, moreover, will have
            kept all their transparency if the metal used was perfectly
            pure. The bottle has, nevertheless, retained traces of metal
            sufficient to transform the properties of aluminium. It is
            only necessary to wash it with water acidulated by one-fifth
            part of hydrochloric acid, to place in it a strip of
            aluminium, and to shake the bottle for thirty seconds to
            cause the strip to exhibit the properties of oxidation
            mentioned, although it is impossible to discover on its
            surface any trace whatever of amalgamation.¹<br>
            <br>
            ¹ As the conditions in which aluminium can combine with
            mercury without the intervention of any reagent may be met
            with in any laboratory, I at first supposed that some of the
            facts I noted must have long been known. After fruitlessly
            consulting the most accredited chemical treatises without
            finding anything but facts relating to the amalgamation of
            aluminium in the presence of bases, I made inquiries of the
            most eminent chemists, and notably of M. Ditte, Professor of
            Chemistry at the Sorbonne, and author of the most complete
            and recent work on the properties of aluminium. One and all
            answered that none of the facts I pointed out, neither as
            regards aluminium nor mercury nor magnesium, had before been
            published.<br>
            <br>
            The proportion of mercury necessary to produce the
            transformation of aluminium can be represented in figures.
            If, to a bottle containing water acidulated by one-fifth of
            hydrochloric acid is added a trace of bichloride of mercury
            so weak that the liquid only contains 1/12000th of its
            weight, and a strip of aluminium be inserted, and the bottle
            shaken for two minutes, the aluminium will have acquired all
            the properties I have indicated, although, as in the
            preceding experiment, there is no <br>
            <br>
            Page 412<br>
            <br>
            trace of amalgamation visible to the naked eye.<br>
            <br>
            The electro-motive force of the modified aluminium is more
            than double that of ordinary aluminium. With a couple formed
            of platinum, pure water, and ordinary aluminium the
            electro-motive force I found was 0.75 volts. By replacing in
            the same couple the ordinary aluminium by the modified
            aluminium, the electro-motive force rose to 1.65 volts.<br>
            <br>
            The hydrogen which is disengaged during the decomposition of
            water by the modified aluminium renders the air a conductor
            of electricity, as may be verified by connecting an
            electroscope with a metal receptacle containing water and
            fragments of transformed aluminium. The discharge of the
            electroscope is about the same whether its charge be
            positive or negative.<br>
            <br>
            In addition to these new properties of oxidizing when cold
            and of decomposing water exhibited by the aluminium, it has
            also acquired the property of being affected by sulphuric,
            acetic, and nitric acids, which in general have no action
            upon it.<br>
            <br>
            To observe this new property the following precautions
            should be taken: -- For acetic acid, it is only necessary to
            use it pure and crystallizable; for nitric acid, the metal
            drawn from the bottle of mercury must be plunged into the
            nitric acid of commerce. After a few seconds the metal is
            very violently attacked, its temperature raised
            considerably, accompanied by the disengagement of heavy
            russet-colored vapour. The reaction is rendered less
            dangerous by adding to the nitric acid half its weight of
            water.<br>
            <br>
            If nitric acid pure at 40° were employed instead of the
            nitric acid of commerce, the aluminium would not be
            affected.<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;The difference of action by pure and impure nitric
            acid is not an isolated example. It has long <br>
            <br>
            Page 413<br>
            <br>
            been known that there is a difference in the action
            exercised on lead by pure and ordinary water. Pure water
            attacks it, while ordinary water does not. It is sufficient
            to pour distilled water on recently prepared lead filings
            for the liquid to become tinted in a few minutes by the
            formation of oxide of lead. With ordinary instead of
            distilled water the liquid remains perfectly limpid.
            Ordinary water modifies the surface of the metal, and
            deposits on it insoluble carbonates and sulphates.<br>
            <br>
            Sulphuric acid does not affect ordinary aluminium, as the
            chemistry books teach us; but it energetically attacks
            modified aluminium. Pure sulphuric acid is almost devoid of
            action. Sulphuric acid in twice its volume of water must be
            used. Once the action has commenced, enough water can be
            added to reduce the sulphuric acid to one-hundredth part.
            The reaction continues with almost the same vivacity.
            Sulphuric acid diluted to the one-hundredth degree, which
            has an action almost nil on aluminium not already attacked,
            has, on the contrary, a very great action as soon as the
            reaction has started. Consequently, it has the power of
            continuing but not of exciting it.<br>
            <br>
            The fact that sulphuric acid pure or diluted does not attack
            ordinary aluminium is taught in chemistry books, but it is
            not quite exact. Pure sulphuric acid, it is true, has no
            action, but with half its measure of water added it
            instantaneously attacks aluminium, though less energetically
            than in the case of modified aluminium. The verification of
            so simple a fact not being open to any misconception, it
            must be supposed that the divergence between what is written
            in the books and what is shown by observation is due to the
            chemists, who first studied the action of sulphuric acid on
            aluminium, making use of a metal containing foreign bodies
            which modern manufacture has <br>
            <br>
            Page 414<br>
            <br>
            succeeded in eliminating. Foreign bodies in aluminium
            greatly modify its properties. I have come across samples of
            impure aluminium with which I was unable to effect any of
            the preceding experiments.<br>
            <br>
            In his notable memoir on the properties of aluminium, M.
            Ditte had already shown that this metal could be affected by
            acids, but only by adopting certain devices. For weak
            sulphuric acid to act, a little chloride of platinum has to
            be added; for nitric acid, a vacuum has to be made above the
            metal plunged into the acid. The attack, moreover, is very
            slow, and in no wise violent, as is the case with modified
            aluminium. M. Ditte has concluded, from his numerous
            experiments, that aluminium is a metal easily liable to
            attack under many conditions, several of which are still
            undetermined. The fact appears indisputable. The Navy has
            been compelled to abandon the use of aluminium, and unless
            means be found to associate it with a metal able to modify
            its properties, it will be impossible to employ it, as has
            been proposed, for metallic constructions.<br>

            </b><b>EXPERIMENTS ON THE PASSAGE OF THE ELEMENTS PRODUCED
              BY THE DISSOCIATION OF MATTER THROUGH MATERIAL OBSTACLES.</b><br>
            <br>
            I have already given, in the body of this work, photographs
            showing how varied are the equilibria which may be imposed
            on particles of dissociated matter by utilizing their
            attractions and repulsions, and it would be useless to
            return to the subject. I have likewise reproduced
            photographs showing that by increasing the speed of
            projection of these particles by a rise in the electric
            tension of the apparatus generating them, they may be made
            visibly to pass through material objects. This operation
            having great importance, I recur to it so as to fully
            describe the tecnique which I did not previously go into.<br>
            <br>
            The apparatus used, re[resented in Fig. 62, is very simple,
            but the adjustment of the great solenoid serving to
            considerably raise the electric tension is rather delicate.
            The position in which one of the wires starting from the
            small solenoid will give the maximum result -- that is, a
            long sheaf of effluves round the ball terminal of the
            solenoid -- has to be ascertained by repeated experiments.
            The coil used must give at least 30 centimètres of spark for
            the effects observed to be very clear. When the apparatus is
            properly regulated, there will be seen to issue from the
            terminal a sheaf of effluves having the exact appearance of
            the dotted rays reproduced in the sketch. These effluves <br>

            the arrangement for giving to the effluves produced by
            particles of dissociated matter sufficient tension to enable
            them to pass through thin plates of non-conducting bodies,
            such as glass and ebonite. A, induction coil. It must be
            able to give sparks of 30 centimetres minimum length. B, C,
            Leyden jars connected with the poles of the coil. Their
            internal coatings are connected to two rods, a, b,
            terminating with balls which are set about a centimetre
            apart, and between which the discharge takes place. E, small
            solenoid, connected with the two external coatings of the
            Leyden jars. H, large solenoid formed of coiled copper wire.
            It is connected with the solenoid E by two wires, GF. The
            position of the wire G is invariable. That of the wire F
            should be determined by experiment until the maximum of
            effluves in tufts at K is obtained. I, metallic rod fixed to
            the first spire of the solenoid. At its extremity are formed
            the tufts capable of passing through opaque bodies. K, strip
            of glass or ebonite through which the tufts of effluves
            pass. Its thickness must not exceed 1/2 millimètre maximum.<br>
            <br>
            possess the surprising property of traversing without
            deviation thin strips of various bodies: ebonite, glass,
            etc., placed in their way. This effect can seldom be
            produced if the thickness of these strips <br>
            <br>
            Page 417<br>
            <br>
            exceeds half a millimetre.¹<br>
            <br>
            The experience is very striking. The course of these rays
            can be followed with naked eye, which would not be the case
            if it were a question of a secondary emission or of a
            phenomenon of condensation.<br>
            <br>
            I know of no other experiment by which the visible passage
            of particles through a material obstacle can be verified. I
            need not recall the fact that an electric spark can very
            well pierce through a solid body, as can be verified by
            placing a strip of glass or of cardboard between the two
            poles of a static machine or of an induction coil. But then
            the object is pierced, while in my experiment the effluves
            pass through it without piercing it.<br>
            <br>
            Mr. F. Legge has repeated this experiment with a Tesla
            transformer, surrounded by solid vaseline. Owing to the
            elevation of tension thus obtained, he has succeeded in
            compelling the effluves to pass through ebonite discs
            half-centimetre thick, while with the apparatus at my
            disposal they will not pass through strips thicker than
            half-millimètre.²<br>
            <br>
            ¹ It should be noted that the substance to be traversed must
            be an insulator of electricity. I have myself used with
            success discs of glass, ebonite, sulphur, and shellac
            respectively, of 1/2 cm. in thickness, and a disc of
            paraffin wax of 1 cm.; nor do I doubt that these thicknesses
            might be exceeded if the tension were sufficiently raised,
            -- F. L.<br>
            <br>
            ² The apparatus employed by me consists of a transformer of
            the pattern designed by Elster an Geitel, and made by
            Ernecke of Berlin. The oscillatory discharge is given by two
            Leyden jars 40 cm. high, connected in parallel, discharging
            through a spark gap of 1 cm. sheltered from the light, and
            fed by a very powerful induction coil with a spark-length of
            35 cm. -- F. L.<br>
            <br>
            If the effluves, obtained as has been explained, are made to
            pass through a Crookes' tube without either metallic cathode
            or anode -- that is to say, through a simple glass receiver
            in which a high <br>

            <br>
            vacuum has been created, a production of X rays will be
            obtained in sufficient abundance to show clearly the
            skeleton of the hand on a screen of platino-cyanide of
            barium. This very unforeseen experiment has always surprised
            the physicists to whom I have shown it.¹<br>
            <br>
            ¹ By suspending above the apparatus an inverted glass funnel
            containing an inner funnel of thin copper foil from which a
            wire is run so as to make contact with the charging rod of
            an electroscope, it can be shown that these "effluves" are
            positively charged. That the discharge from the secondary
            coil of such a transformer as is mentioned in Note 2, p.
            417, is positive, has been shown by the researches of Dr.
            von Wesendonk. -- F. L.<br>

            </b><b>DOCUMENTS RELATING TO THE HISTORY OF THE DISCOVERY OF
              THE UNIVERSAL DISSOCIATION OF MATTER.</b><br>
            <br>
            In a recent work M. Becquerel has given an historical sketch
            of the discovery of radio-activity, and has caused the
            passages relating to me to be reproduced in small volumes
            for popular use. He asserts therein that my experiments for
            the most part affect a complication "which conceals the real
            cause of the phenomena observed." He concludes by saying,
            "It is sufficient to read the publications of M. Gustave Le
            Bon in Comptes rendus [de l'Académie des Sciences] to be
            convicted that, at the time they were written, the author
            had no idea of the phenomena of radio-activity."<br>
            <br>
            Evidently no one is going to verify the assertions of M.
            Becquerel in the Comptes rendus of this period (1896-97),
            but should any one do so, what would be learn?<br>
            <br>
            He would learn that for three years, M. Becquerel took
            infinite pains, with multiple and varied experiments, to
            prove that the radiations emitted by uranium could be
            polarized, reflected, and refracted, and, consequently, were
            only, according to the definition of J. J. Thomson, "one of
            the forms of light" -- an opinion which M. Becquerel himself
            acknowledged later to be entirely erroneous. The idea M.
            Becquerel himself entertained at that time was therefore as
            inexact as possible.<br>
            <br>
            Page 420<br>
            <br>
            In papers published by me at this very period, I upheld an
            opinion diametrically opposite to his. I laboured, in fact,
            to prove, contrary to his assertions, that the radiations of
            uranium could not be reflected, refracted, nor polarized.
            They, therefore, had no relationship to light, and
            constituted in my ideas a new form of energy very much akin
            to the X rays. I added that the uranium rays were identical
            with the effluves emitted by all bodies, under the influence
            of light. Time has proved the correctness of these various
            assertions, which I was then alone in maintaining.<br>
            <br>
            The historical sketch of M. Becquerel thus constitutes a
            complete inversion of the most evident facts, and, were I
            inclined to make use of the expressions he uses with regard
            to me and the first experiments on the phenomena afterwards
            termed "radio-activity," I have the right to say that it was
            he, at that time in question, who "had no conception of the
            phenomena of radio-activity." But since the text of the
            Comptes rendus of the Académie des Sciences are referred to,
            I will quote them.<br>
            <br>
            All the experiments of M. Becquerel tending to prove that
            the rays emitted by uranium refract, reflect, and polarize,
            are described therein most circumstantially and in detail.
            He proves the refraction of the uranium rays by means of a
            mirror, and their polarization by the classic process of
            tourmaline plates with crossed axes. These various
            experiments he checks one by the other, and on three
            different occasions repeats his assertions, each time
            bringing forward new demonstrations (Comptes rendus, 1896,
            pp. 561, 693, 763). His last controlling experiment was,
            according to him, absolutely categorical, and he drew from
            it the following conclusions: --<br>
            <br>
            "This experiment therefore shows, for the invisible rays
            emitted by salts of uranium, alike the <br>
            <br>
            Page 421<br>
            <br>
            double refraction, the polarization of the two rays and
            their unequal absorption through the tourmaline."<br>
            <br>
            We know -- for M. Becquerel has since acknowledged it -- how
            incorrect these experiments were, and, consequently, what a
            false idea he then entertained of radio-activity.<br>
            <br>
            "What there is piquant in this," writes Professor de Heen on
            the subject of the polarization and the reflection of the
            uranium rays, "is, that it took three years for M. Becquerel
            to convince himself that Dr. Gustave Le Bon was right, and
            even then an American physicist had to come to the rescue.¹<br>
            <br>
            M. Becquerel, moreover, gave explanations on this matter
            before the Physical Congress in 1900 in a manner that would
            lead to the belief that he had spontaneously discovered his
            mistake.<br>
            <br>
            "The experiment on the polarization of the uranium rays," he
            stated, "did not in the end yield the same results either
            with tourmaline plates or with other methods. The same
            negative conclusions have been arrived at by M. Rutherford
            and M Gustave Le Bon."²<br>
            <br>

            has been said, not an American, but a Canadian. -- F. L.<br>

            I have indicated the passages in the Comptes rendus relating
            to the first experiments of M. Becquerel; I will now recall
            those concerning my own. At that period (1896-97) I was
            still confusing two very different things: 1st, infra-red
            radiations which, contrary to the teachings of science,
            passed through, as I proved, most non-conducting bodies --
            wood, stone, black paper, ebonite, etc.; 2nd, radiations
            emitted by metals under the influence of light and which I
            affirmed to be identical with the cathode and uranium rays,
            as thenceforth admitted by all physicists.<br>
            <br>
            Page 422<br>
            <br>
            Here are a few extracts from my published papers -- <br>
            <br>
            "From the beginning of the year 1897 (Comptes rendus, 5th
            August 1897, p. 755) I showed that all bodies struck by
            light give birth to radiations of the family of the cathode
            rays."<br>
            <br>
            A few weeks later I showed the analogy of these radiations
            emitted by bodies under the action of light with uranium
            rays, and concluded my paper with the words, "The properties
            of uranium must therefore only be one particular case of a
            very general law." (Comptes rendus, 1897, p. 895.)<br>
            <br>
            My first researches were developed for eight years in
            numerous memoirs, in which I detailed every time new
            experiments. And my first experiments having appeared to be
            somewhat forgotten by authors who daily rediscovered facts
            already pointed out by me, I drew attention to my anterior
            publications in a note in the Comptes rendus de l' Académie
            des Sciences, 1902, p. 32, from which I extract the
            following: --<br>
            <br>
            "At the very beginning of my researches on the mode of
            energy to which I gave the name of Black Light, I stated
            that the effluves emitted by bodies struck by light are of
            the same nature as the uranium rays, which are commonly
            considered as identical with the cathode rays, and as being
            constituted by the elements of dissociated atoms, and the
            carriers of electric changes.<br>
            <br>
            "Enlarging the circle of these researches, I demonstrated
            later that similar efflusives were manifested in a large
            number of chemical reactions, and I was able to conclude
            this production of effluves under very varying influences
            cinstituted one of the most widespread of the phenomena of
            nature.<br>
            <br>
            "Since that epoch, several authors, Lenard especially, have
            also arrived at this conclusion that <br>
            <br>
            Page 423<br>
            <br>
            metals struck by light generate cathode rays which are
            subject to deviation by a magnet.<br>
            <br>
            "All effluves disengaged under the action of light in the
            conditions just set forth exhibit the closest analogies with
            the emissions now described under the name of radio-activity
            of matter. The production of these last therefore does
            appear to be, as I was a long time alone in maintaining, a
            particular case of a very general law. This general law is,
            that under diverse influences, the atoms of matter may be
            subject to a strong dissociation, and give birth to effluves
            with properties very different from those of the bodies from
            which they emanate." (Comptes rendus, 1902, p. 32.)<br>
            <br>
            The loss of memory on the part of certain physicists had
            already struck one of the most eminent of them. M. de Heen,
            Professor of Physics at the University of Liège, somewhat
            scandalized by this fact, wrote a memoir: Quel est l'auteur
            de la découverte des phénomènes dits radio-actifs?
            (published by the Institut de Physique of Liège in 1901) in
            which, from published documents alone, he re-established the
            truth.<br>
            <br>
            I had at that time never seen the learned professor, and
            only knew his paper through its being sent to me. Had he
            consulted me before publishing it, I should have informed
            him that the only point I cared for was the demonstration of
            the universality of the radio-activity of matter, seeing
            that the real author of the discovery of radio-activity was
            Niepce de Saint-Victor, who revealed, fifty years ago, the
            properties which salts of uranium possessed, of emitting for
            months together radiations in the dark, as I will again show
            later on. Those who afterwards brought the question entirely
            up to date were Curie, with his great discovery of Radium,
            and Rutherford with his study of the radiation of
            radio-active bodies.<br>
            <br>
            Page 424<br>
            <br>
            The works for popular use due to the disciples of M.
            Becquerel exhibit the above facts in a totally different
            light. In M Berget's work Le Radium may be read, page 37,
            "Thereafter the labours of M. Becquerel were so many
            victories: one after the other he discovered in 1896 and
            1897 that the rays emitted by uranium were subject neither
            to reflection by mirrors nor refraction by prisms." This is
            the exact contrary to what M. Becquerel was then
            persistently seeking to demonstrate. The quotations given
            above prove this clearly.<br>
            <br>
            More than one philosophical lesson can be learned from the
            above. I am not speaking, let it be understood, of the
            method of writing history of which the above is a specimen;
            it has never been written otherwise. I simply wish to point
            out the intensity of the illusions which the suggestion
            derived from preconceived ideas may create in the mind of a
            clever physicist with many assistants. If Niepce de
            Saint-Victor had not formerly written that the radiations
            emitted in the dark by salts of uranium were light stored up
            -- that is to say, a kind of phosphorescence -- M. Becquerel
            would assuredly never have dreamed of considering that they
            must necessarily be refracted, reflected, and polarized.
            Such errors as these easily explain some of the enormities
            written in complete good faith on the subject of the N rays.<br>
            <br>
            In the same book, where I am so harshly dealt with, M.
            Becquerel finally decided, for the first time, to mention
            the name of Niepce de Saint-Victor, having hitherto confined
            himself to reproducing his experiments on the salts of
            uranium and following his predecessor even in his errors,
            since he shared his belief in a kind of stored-up light.<br>
            <br>
            Not very equitable towards the living, M. Becquerel is still
            less so towards the dead, and his <br>
            <br>
            Page 425<br>
            <br>
            suppressions are at times very unilluminating. Niepce is
            disposed of in a few lines. "Niepce," he says, "was unable
            to observe the radiation of uranium because he employed
            plates insufficiently sensitive."<br>
            <br>
            It is sufficient to read the Comptes rendus of that period
            to see how little foundation there is for this assertion. As
            early as 1867, Niepce observed that salts of uranium
            enclosed in a tin case caused impressions on plates in the
            dark. "The same activity," he says, "is noticed after
            several months as on the first day."¹<br>
            <br>
            ¹ Quoted by M. Guillaume from the Comptes rendus de
            l'Académie des Sciences, 1867, in&nbsp; Radiations
            Nouvelles, 2nd edition, p. 133.<br>
            <br>
            If it were true -- and such is not at all the case -- that
            Niepce de Saint-Victor had actually divined the existence of
            the only body in nature which possessed the property of
            emitting radiation in obscurity, such a divination would
            have been a little more than a stroke of genius.<br>
            <br>
            But Niepce had no such claims. He was a conscientious and
            patient observer, ignored during his lifetime, forgotten
            when dead. The fact that only two physicists have dared to
            recall to M. Becquerel the experiments of Niepce shows how
            small a degree of scientific independence exists in France.<br>
            <br>
            It is impossible to think without bitterness of the
            opposition offered to Niepce by the official scholars of his
            time. If, instead of endeavouring to ridicule his memorable
            experiments, an attempt had been made to repeat them, there
            certainly would have been found some one to think of
            determining how long the salts of uranium could continue, in
            the darkness, to impress plates, exactly as it occurred to
            M. Becquerel. And if Niepce had persisted, as did later M.
            Becquerel, in the mistake of believing in stored-up light,
            akin to phosphorescence, some one would again have been
            found to <br>
            <br>
            Page 426<br>
            <br>
            show him -- as was shown to M. Becquerel -- that these
            radiations, not being polarizable, could not be light.
            Radio-active phenomena would then have been as quickly
            discovered as they were where the demonstration of the
            non-polarization of the uranium rays proved that it was a
            question of something entirely novel. In view of the
            discoveries brought to light by the simple fact that uranium
            preserves indefinitely its powers of impressing a
            photographic plate in darkness, it may be said that the
            opposition and indifference to Niepce de Saint-Victor's
            experiments have immensely retarded the progress of science
            for more than fifty years.<br>
            <br>
            To end definitely a polemic which might continue for ever, I
            do not fear contradiction when I state that to judge the
            work of one who makes researches, the subject of them should
            be examined as to its state before and its condition after
            his researches.<br>
            <br>
            1stly. It was thought that uranium emitted a kind of
            invisible light. Well, I proved that it emitted something
            entirely new, which was analogous to the radiations of the
            family of the X rays, and consequently had no relationship
            whatever to light -- a fact which has since been completely
            verified.<br>
            <br>
            2ndly. It was absolutely unknown that metals struck by light
            acquired properties identical with those of the uranium and
            the cathode rays. I demonstrated this, contrary to all
            accepted ideas. The fact, which has long been known, that
            certain electrified metals lost their electric charge under
            the influence of light, proceeded, according to Lenard, from
            the fact that under this influence their surface became
            pulverized into dust, which, disseminated in the air,
            carried off the electric charges of the electrified
            particles of the metal.<br>
            <br>
            Lenard, however, was the first to acknowledge his error. On
            the publication of my experiments, <br>
            <br>
            Page 427<br>
            <br>
            he renewed his own, and found that metals under the
            influence of light emitted cathode rays which could be
            deviated by a magnet,¹ and the experiments were subsequently
            confirmed by J. J. Thomson.<br>
            <br>
            ¹ Lenard's memoir, Erzeugung Kathodenstrahlen durch ultra
            violette Licht, was presented to the Academy of Sciences of
            Vienna on the 18th October 1899. My experiments were
            published in the Comptes rendus de l' Académie des Sciences
            of Paris, on the 5th April 1897.<br>
            <br>
            3rdly. At the time referred to it was believed, and M.
            Becquerel believed, that radio-activity was a quite
            exceptional phenomenon belonging to an infinitely limited
            number of bodies. In a series of experiments I showed that
            it was one of the most widespread phenomena in nature,
            produced, not only under the influence of light, but under
            that of heat, and of a large number of chemical reactions.
            This opinion has gradually gained ground, and is now almost
            universally admitted.<br>
            <br>
            In the above enumeration I do not bring into prominence the
            demonstration that all these phenomena are manifestations of
            a new force -- namely, intra-atomic energy, which surpasses
            all others by its colossal magnitude. The existence of this
            force is still in some measure contested, and I only desired
            to recall here those facts which are above all dispute.<br>
            <br>
            4thly. The doctrine of the dissociation of matter was only
            formulated a long time after my researches. The physicists
            of the University of Cambridge have become its warm
            partizans, since one of them declared in the course of a
            recent polemic that it was "the most important theory of
            physics"; but they have taken a long time to range
            themselves on its side. In 1900, J. J. Thomson, a very
            eminent scholar, but one who easily forgets the work of his
            predecessors, still believed that radio-<br>
            <br>
            Page 428<br>
            <br>
            active emissions were a form of light. This is what he wrote
            at that date: "Becquerel found that the radiations of
            uranium can be reflected, polarized, and refracted, so that
            it is evidently one of the forms of light." (Discharge of
            Electricity through Gases, p. 57. 1898.)<br>
            <br>
            This is what I wrote at the same date at the end of a long
            memoir filled with experiments: "As a general conclusion, we
            may say that under the influence of very varied causes --
            light, chemical reactions, electrification, etc. -- bodies
            can dissociate. Matter thus dissociated manifests itself
            under the form of infinitely small particles of immense
            speed, and capable of rendering the air a conductor of
            electricity, and of traversing opaque bodies. These
            particles represent a form of matter quite different from
            those which chemistry has made known to us -- a new state
            where te atom is probably dissociated.<br>
            <br>
            "And surely there can be no question here of properties only
            belonging to certain special bodies, such as uranium,
            thorium, etc., for these bodies only represent, as I said
            long since, particular cases of a very general law." (Revue
            Scientifique, p. 458. April 1900.)<br>
            <br>
            5thly. I will finally add that I was the first to formulate
            in a special memoir the doctrine that all the phenomena of
            the dissociation of matter are the manifestations of a new
            force -- Intra-atomic Energy -- which surpasses all others
            by its colossal magnitude, and whence are derived, according
            to my researches, the greater part of the forces of nature,
            especially electricity and the heat of the sun.<br>
