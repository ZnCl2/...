      <p><b>Introduction ~</b> </p>
      <p>There has been a great interest in examining nonlinear effects
        in the system of rotating magnetic fields. Such effects have
        been observed in the device called Searl's generator or SEG
        (SEG, Searl Effect Generator) [1-4]. An SEG consists of a series
        of three rings and rollers that go around those rings. All parts
        of SEG are based on the Law of the Squares. The rollers revolve
        around the plates that form the rings, but they do not touch
        them. There's a primary north and south pole on the rollers and
        a primary&nbsp; north and south pole on the plates. Obviously
        you will have the north pole of the roller attracted to the
        south pole of the plate. The plate and the rollers have layered
        structure. The external layer - Titan, then Iron, Nylon and last
        internal layer was made from Neodymium. John R.R. Searl has
        supposed that the electrons are given off from the central
        element (which is neodymium), and they travel out through other
        elements.&nbsp; If nylon had not been put there, the SEG would
        act like a laser and one pulse would go out and it would stop,
        build up, and another pulse would go out. But, with the nylon
        being, nylon acts as a control gate, and that control gate gives
        you an even flow of&nbsp; electrons throughout the SEG [4]. In
        [4] it was shown that in the process of&nbsp; magnetization of
        the plate and rollers, the combination of constant and variable
        magnetic fields for creating a special wave (sine wave) pattern
        on a plate surface and rollers surface was used. The basic
        effects are the rollers selfrunning around a ring plate and
        reduction of weight up to occurrence of propulsion and flying up
        of all magnetic system. These effects come about because of a
        special geometry of experimental setup. It was shown that the
        work of the device in critical regime is accompanied by
        biological and real physical phenomena. Unfortunately except for
        the listed references we could not find other information where
        similar effects are be mentioned. In this paper we present the
        experimental device the results we have obtained. </p>
      <p><b>The Description of the Experimental Installation ~</b> </p>
      <p>The basic difficulty is in a choosing the materials and
        maintaining the necessary pattern imprinting on the plate and
        rollers surfaces. To simplify the technology we decided to use a
        one-ring design with one-ring plate (stator) and one-ring of
        rollers (rotor). It is obvious, that it was necessary to
        strengthen the rollers on a rotor by the bearings and balance
        the rollers well. In the suggested design the air bearings were
        used which provided the minimum losses due to friction. From the
        available description [1-4] it was not clear how it is possible
        to make and magnetize the stator with a diameter of about one
        meter. In order to make the stator from separate magnetized
        segments executed on the basis of rare earth magnets with the
        residual induction 1T; the segments were magnetized in a usual
        way by discharging capacitor battery through the coil.
        Afterwards the segments were assembled and glued together in a
        special iron&nbsp; armature, which reduced magnetic energy. To
        manufacture the stator 110 KGs of rare earth magnets were used,
        and to manufacture the rotor 115 KGs of that material was used.
        High-frequency field under magnetization was not applied. It was
        decided to replace an imprinting technology described in [1-4]
        with cross-magnetic inserts having a flux vector directed at 90
        degrees to a vector of basic magnetization of a stator and
        rollers of a rotor. For these cross inserts the modified rare
        earth magnets with a residual magnetization of 1,2 T and
        coercive force a little bit greater than in a base material was
        used. In Figure 1 and Figure 2 the joint arrangement of stator
        1, elements of a rotor - rollers 2 and a way of their mutual
        gearing by means of cross magnetic inserts 19, are shown.
        Between the stator and roller surfaces the air gap <i>d</i> of
        1 mm is left. </p>
      <p>No layered structure was used except a continuous copper foil
        of 0.8 mm thickness which wrapped up the stator and rollers.
        This foil has the direct electrical contact to magnets of a
        stator and rollers. Distance between inserts in the rollers is
        equal to distance between inserts on the stator. </p>
      <p><b>Figure 1: Variant of One-Ring Converter ~</b> </p>
      <p>The ratio of parameters of the stator 1 and the rotor 2 in
        Figure 2 is chosen so that the relation of stator diameter&nbsp;
        D and roller diameter d is an integer equal to or greater then
        12. Choosing such a ratio allows us to achieve a magnetic spin
        wave resonant mode between elements of a working body of the
        device. </p>

          Rollers ~</b> </p>
      <p>The elements of magnetic system were assembled in a uniform
        design on the aluminium platform. In Figure 3 the general view
        of the platform with one-ring converter is displayed. This
        platform was supplied with springs, amortizators and had a
        possibility of moving vertical on three supports. The value of
        displacement was measured by the induction meter of displacement
        14; thus the change of the platform weight at once has been
        defined during the experiment in real time. Gross weight of the
        platform with magnetic system in the initial condition was 350
        KGs. </p>

      <p>The stator 1 was mounted motionlessly, and the rollers 2 were
        assembled on a mobile common separator 3, connected with the
        basic shaft 4 of the device. Through this shaft the rotary
        moment was transferred. The basic shaft by the means of friction
        muff 5 was connected to the electrodynamics generator 7 and
        starting engine 6, which accelerated the converter up to a mode
        of self-sustained rotation. Along a rotor the electromagnetic
        inductors 8 with open cores 9 were located. The magnetic rollers
        2 crossed the open cores of inductors and closed the magnetic
        flux through electromagnetic inductors 8, and induced emf in
        them, which acted directly on an active load 10 (a set of
        incandescent lamps with total power 1 kW). The electromagnetic
        inductors 8 were equipped with an electrical drive 11 and had an
        opportunity to smoothly move on supports 12. To study the
        influence of the external high voltage on the characteristics of
        the converter the system of radial electrical polarization
        was&nbsp; mounted. On periphery of the rotor ring electrodes 13
        were set between the electromagnetic inductors 8 having with the
        rollers 2 air gap of 10 mm. The electrodes are connected to a
        high-voltage source; the positive potential was connected to the
        stator, and the negative to the polarization electrodes. The
        voltage was adjusted in a range of 0-20 kV. In experiments the
        constant value of 20 kV was used. In case of emergency braking,
        friction disk from the ordinary car braking system was mounted
        on a basic shaft of the rotor. The electrodynamics generator 7
        was connected to active load through a set of switches ensuring
        step connection of the load from 1 kW to 10 kW. The converter
        under going testing had in its inner structure the oil friction
        generator of thermal energy 15, intended for taping a
        superfluous power (more than 10 kW) into the thermo-exchange
        contour. But since the real output power of the converter in
        experiment has not exceeded 7 kW, the oil friction thermal
        generator was not used. The complete stabilization of
        revolutions of the rotor was carried out by electromagnetic
        inductors connected to an additional load, which was set of
        incandescent lamps with total power 1 kW. </p>
      <p><b>Experimental Results ~</b> </p>
      <p>The magnetic-gravity converter was built in a laboratory&nbsp;
        room on three concrete supports at a ground level. The ceiling
        height the lab room was&nbsp; 3 meters. Besides the presence of
        the iron-concrete ceiling, in immediate proximity from the
        magnetic system there was a generator and electric motor, which
        contained some tens KGs of iron and could potentially deform the
        field's pattern. The device was started by the electric motor,
        which accelerated the rotation of the rotor. The revolutions
        were smoothly increased up to the moment the ammeter included in
        a circuit of the electric motor started to show zero or lower
        value of a consumed current or even a presence of the back
        current. The presence of the back current is detected at approx.
        550 rpm. The magnetic moving sensor 14 starts to detect the
        change in weight of the whole installation at 200 rpm.
        Afterwards the electric motor is completely disconnected by the
        electromagnetic muff and the ordinary electrodynamics generator
        is connected to the basic shaft of the device through the same
        muff. The rotor of the converter continues to self-accelerate
        and with the approach to the critical mode of 550 rpm, the
        weight of the device quickly changes. In addition to the change
        speed of rotation the weight depend of the power, removed into
        active load, (the set of ten ordinary electrical water heaters
        of 1 kW was used) and of the applied polarizing voltage, as
        well. At the maximum output power equal to 6-7 kW the change of
        weight G of the whole platform (total weight is about 350 KGs),
        reaches 35 % of the weight in an initial condition G?. A load of
        more than 7 kW results in a gradual decrease of revolutions and
        exit from the mode of self-generation with the subsequent
        complete stop of the rotor. The weight of a platform can be
        controlled by applying of a high voltage to cellular ring
        electrodes located at a distance of 10 mm from external surfaces
        of the rollers. Under the high 20 kV voltage (electrodes
        negative pole) the increase of taped power in circuit of the
        basic generator more than 6 kW does not influence G while the
        revolutions per min is not decreased to 400 rpm. "Tightening" of
        this effect is observed as well as the effect of hysteresis on G
        (a kind of "residual induction"). The experimental diagrams
        given on Fig.4 illustrate the modes of the converter operations.

      <p>The effect of a local change of the platform weight is
        convertible relative to the direction of rotor turning, and has
        the same hysteresis. At clockwise rotation the critical mode
        comes in the area of 550 rpm and the propulsion force against
        the direction of gravitation vector is created, by analogy, at
        counter-clockwise rotation the critical mode comes the in area
        of 600 rpm and the propulsion on the direction of gravitation
        vector is created. The difference in approach to a critical mode
        of 50-60 rpm was observed. It is necessary to mention that the
        most interesting region lies above the critical area of 550 rpm,
        but due to of a number of circumstances the implementation of
        such research was not possible. Other interesting effects
        include the work of the converter in the dark room when corona
        discharges are observed around the converter's rotor as a
        blue-pink glowing luminescence and a characteristic ozone&nbsp;
        smell. The cloud of ionization covers the area of a stator and a
        rotor and has accordingly toroidal form. On the background of
        luminescence glowing on rollers' surfaces we distinguished wave
        picture. A number of more vigorous strips of discharges around
        the rollers were observed. These discharges were of the white -
        yellow colour is, but the characteristic for the arc discharges
        sound was not audible.&nbsp; One more effect previously not
        mentioned was observed i.e. the vertical magnetic&nbsp; "walls"
        around the installation. We noticed and measured the abnormal
        permanent magnetic field around the converter in the radius of
        15 meters. The zones of an&nbsp; increased intensity of a
        magnetic flux 0,05T located concentrically from the centre of
        the installation were detected. The direction of&nbsp; magnetic
        field vector in these walls coincided with the direction of
        rollers' field vector. The structure of these zones reminded
        circles on water from the thrown stone. Between these zones a
        portable magnetometer, which used the Hall's sensor as a
        sensitive element, did not register abnormal magnetic fields.
        The layers of an increased intensity are distributed practically
        without losses up to a distance of about 15 meters from the
        centre of the converter and quickly decrease at the border of
        this zone. The thickness of each layer is about 5 - 8 cm. The
        border of each layer has sharp shape, the distance between
        layers is about 50 - 60 cm and it slightly accrues when moving
        from the centre of the converter. The steady picture of this
        field was observed as well at a height of 6 m above the
        installation (on the second floor above the lab.). Above the
        second floor the measurements were not carried out. The abnormal
        fall of the temperature in direct affinity from the converter
        was also found. While the common temperature background in
        laboratory was + 22? (2?) the fall of temperature equal to 6-8?
        was noticed. The same phenomenon was observed in vertical
        magnetic walls as well as. The measurements of temperature
        inside the magnetic walls were carried out by the ordinary
        alcohol thermometer with inertia of indication about 1,5 min. In
        the magnetic walls the temperature changes can be distinctly
        observed even by hand. The hand when placed into this magnetic
        wall feels real cold at once. The similar picture was observed
        at the height above installation, i.e. on the second floor of
        the laboratory as well as despite the ferro-concrete blocking of
        ceiling. </p>
      <p><b>Discussion ~</b> </p>
      <p>All the results we obtained are extremely unusual and require
        some theoretical explanation. Unfortunately the interpretation
        of results within the framework of the conventional physical
        theory cannot explain all the observed phenomena and first of
        all the change of weight. The change of weight is possible to
        interpret as a local change of gravity force or as an occurrence
        of propulsion force by repelling from its own field. </p>
      <p>Direct experiment, confirming a presence of draft force was not
        performed, but in any case both interpretations of the weight
        change do not correspond to the modern physical paradigm and
        demand reconsideration of the standard theory of gravitation or
        criticism of the second law of Newton, both of which are only
        possible if we take into consideration the now-advert physical
        media ether as understood by&nbsp;&nbsp; Faraday-Maxwell-Mie.
        From the modern physics position electrization and luminescence
        of the converter's magnetic system in the near zone is not
        completely clear. The phenomenon of the magnetic and thermal
        "walls" may be connected with&nbsp; Alphen's magnetic-sound
        waves raised in near zone in magnetized plasma induced by a
        variable magnetic field of a rotating rotor [5]. </p>
      <p>At the present time we can not give an exact description of the
        interactions mechanism with environment and transformation of
        energy, but it is completely obvious, that without the use of
        the concept of physical media --- the ether in a sense of
        Faraday-Maxwell-Mie we are completely unable to give physically
        substantial theory of these phenomena. In conclusion, we
        emphasize that the issues of the biological influence effects
        and especially of the variations of real time stream effects,
        which must be taking place in an operative zone of the
        converter, were not considered at all.&nbsp; These issues are
        extremely important and absolutely unexplored; though there are
        some mentions of J.R.R.Searl about healing action of the SEG's
        radiation. Our own experience allows to make only cautious
        assumption that the short-term stay (dozen minutes) in a working
        zone of the converter with the fixed output power of 6 kW
        remains for the people without observed consequences. The
        present paper is only a&nbsp; beginning. </p>

      <p><b>Abstract ~</b> </p>
      <p>It is demonstrated that a magnetic system based on rare-earth
        magnets is capable of converting various forms of the energy,
        provided that a certain critical operating regime is set up. As
        the critical regime is attained, the experimental setup becomes
        energetically fully autonomous. This is accompanied by local
        variations in the total structure weight, a decrease in the
        surrounding air temperature, and the formation of concentric
        "magnetic walls" at a distance of up to 15 meters from the
        experimental setup. </p>
      <p><b>Introduction ~</b> </p>
      <p>We have experimentally studied the physical effects in a system
        based on rotating permanent magnets (1). Below we describe the
        technology of manufacture, assembly, and the results of testing
        this experimental setup, which is referred to as the converter.
      </p>
      <p><b>Technological Description ~</b> </p>
      <p>The converter comprises an immobile stator and a rotor moving
        around the stator and carrying fixed magnetic rollers. The
        magnetic system of the working body of the converter has a
        diameter of about 1 meter. The stator and magnetic rollers were
        manufactured from separate magnetized segments made of
        rare-earth magnets (REMs) with a residual magnetization of 0.85
        T, a coercive force of [Hc] ~ 600 kA/m, and a specific magnetic
        energy of [W] ~ 150 K/m3. The segments were magnetized by a
        conventional method based on a discharge of a capacitor bank
        through an inductor coil. Then the magnetized segments were
        assembled and glued together in a special mounting stage, which
        provided for the necessary tolerance in positioning the segments
        and for the removal of magnetic energy. Using this mounting
        stage, it was possible to glue the elements into the common
        unit. The stable incorporated REMs with a total weight of 110 kg
        and the rollers contained 115 kg of the same REM material. </p>
      <p>The magnetic system elements were assembled into a single
        structure on a special platform made of non-magnetic structural
        alloys. The platform construction was provided with springs and
        shock absorbers and allowed the converter setup to move in the
        vertical direction on three sides. The motion was monitored by
        an inductive transducer. Which allowed changes ion the platform
        weight to be determined in the course of the experiment. The
        total weight of the platform with the magnetic system in the
        initial state was 350 kg. </p>
      <p><b>Description of the Observed Effects ~</b> </p>
      <p>The converter was installed in a 2.5-meter high laboratory room
        using three concrete supports on a ground level. In addition to
        the ordinary steel-reinforced concrete ceiling blocks, the
        converter equipment featured a usual electrodynamic generator
        and an electric motor, with a total iron weight of several tens
        of kilograms (only these parts could, in principle, introduce
        distortions into the electromagnetic field pattern observed). </p>
      <p>The converter was set to operate by over-speeding the rotor
        with the aid of the electric motor. The motor speed was
        gradually increased until the ammeter connected in the motor
        circuit showed zero consumed current and the current direction
        reversal. This state corresponded to a rotor speed of
        approximately 550 rpm, but the motion transducer began to
        indicate a change in the platform weight already at 200 rpm.
        Then the electric motor was disconnected using an
        electromagnetic overrunning clutch, and a usual electrodynamic
        generator was connected instead to the main shaft of the
        converter via another electromagnetic clutch. On attaining the
        critical regime (~550 rpm), the rotor exhibited a sharp increase
        in the rotation speed; this was accompanied by a slow-down in
        the rate of the current weight reduction. At this instant, the
        first 1 kW load was connected to the system. Immediately upon
        this connection, the rotation speed began to decrease, while the
        Delta G value kept increasing, and so on as depicted in the
        figure. </p>

      <p>A diagram illustrating various operation regimes of the
        magnetogravitational converter showing (I) load power (kW) and
        system weight variation; (II) 7-kW load (high voltage off);
        (III) 7-kW load (high voltage on); (IV) supercritical regime;
        (V) subcritical regime (1, high voltage off; 2, high voltage
        on). </p>
      <p>The system weight variation depend both on the power consumed
        by the active load (the load consisted of 10 ordinary 1-kW
        heating elements) and on the polarization voltage applied. For a
        maximum consumed power (7 kW), a change in the total platform
        weight reached 35% of the initial value in the immobile state
        (350 kg), which corresponded to 50% of the pure weight of the
        working body of the converter. An increase in the load power
        above 7 kW led to a gradual decrease in the rotor speed and,
        eventually, to the system going out of the self-generation
        regime and the rotor speed decreasing until the full stop. The
        platform weight could be controlled by applying a high-voltage
        signal to the cellular ring electrodes situated 10 mm above the
        external roller surface. Upon applying a 20 kV signal (negative
        polarity on the electrodes), an increase in the load power
        consumption above 6 kW did not affect the Delta G value even
        when the rotor speed decreased down to 400 rpm. This was
        equivalent to "prolongation" of the effect and was accompanied
        by phenomena of the remnant induction" type with respect to
        Delta G. The converter operation in various experimental regimes
        is illustrated in the figure. </p>
      <p>The effect of the system weight variation is reversible with
        respect to the direction of rotor motion and exhibits certain
        hysteresis. For the clockwise rotation, the critical regime is
        observed in the region of 550 rpm and is accompanied by
        development of the force acting against the gravity vector. For
        the counter-clockwise rotation, the onset of the critical regime
        is observed at approximately 600 rpm and the extra force
        coincides in direction with the gravity vector. The onset of the
        critical regime exhibited a scatter within 50-60 rpm. It should
        be noted that, probably, some other critical resonance regimes
        may exist, which correspond to higher rotor speeds and markedly
        greater useful load levels. Proceeding from the general
        theoretical consideration, the output mechanical energy must
        nonlinearly depend on the internal parameters of the converter
        magnetic system and the rotor speed, so that the observed
        effects are likely to be far from optimum. Establishing of the
        maximum output power maximum weight variation, and the converter
        energy resource is of considerable theoretical and practical
        interest. </p>
      <p>Besides the phenomena described above, a number of other
        interesting effects were observed in the system studied. In
        particular, the converter operation in the dark is accompanied
        by a corona discharge with a pink-blue light emission and by the
        production of ozone. The ionization cloud is formed around the
        stator and rotor, acquiring a toroidal shape. The general corona
        discharge background is superimposed with a wavy pattern
        corresponding to the surface of the rollers: the zones of
        increased emission intensity are distributed along the roller
        height in a manner similar to that observed for the high-voltage
        microwave induction energy storage in the pre-breakdown state.
        These zones appeared yellowish-white, but the emission was not
        accompanied by sounds characteristic of the arc discharge. Nor
        did we observe any visible erosive damage on the stator and
        rotor surfaces. </p>
      <p>One more effect, which was never reported previously, is the
        appearance of vertical "magnetic walls" surrounding the setup.
        We have detected and measured an anomalous constant magnetic
        field around the converter. The measurements revealed zones of
        increased magnetic strength on the order of 0.05 T arranged
        coaxially relative to the system center. The direction of the
        magnetic field vector on the "walls" coincides with that in the
        rollers. The structure of these magnetic zones resembles the
        pattern of circular waves on the water surface. No anomalous
        field is detected by a mobile magnetometer, employing the Hall
        effect transducer, in the area between zones. The layers of
        increased magnetic field strength are propagating with virtually
        no attenuation to a distance of 15 meters from the converter
        center and then rapidly decayed at the boundary of this 15-meter
        area. Each layer zone is 5-8 cm thick and exhibits sharp
        boundaries. The layers are spaced by 50-60 cm, the spacing
        slightly increasing with the distance from the converter center.
        A stable pattern was also observed at&nbsp; a height of 5 meters
        above the setup (the measurements were conducted in a 2nd floor
        room above the laboratory; no tests were conducted on a still
        higher level). </p>
      <p>Another interesting phenomenon consists in an anomalous
        temperature drop in the immediate vicinity of the converter. At
        a general room temperature level in the laboratory (+22 +-2 C),
        the temperature at the converter surface was 6-8 C lower.
        Similar temperature variations were detected in the vertical
        magnetic "walls". The temperature changes in the walls were
        detected by an ordinary alcohol thermometer with a reading set
        time of 1.5 minutes. The temperature variations in the magnetic
        "walls" can even be sensed by the human body: a hand placed
        inside the "wall" immediately feels cold. The same pattern was
        observed at a height of 5 meters above the setup in a 2nd floor
        room above the laboratory (despite the steel-reinforced concrete
        blocks separating the rooms). </p>
      <p><b>Discussion of Results ~</b> </p>
      <p>All the experimental results described above are very unusual
        and need some theoretical rationalization. Unfortunately,
        attempts at interpreting the obtained results within the
        framework of the existing physical theories showed that no one
        of these models can explain the whole set of experimental data.
      </p>
      <p>Recently, Dyatlov (2) attempted to combine the concepts of
        electricity and gravity by introducing the so-called
        electronavigation and magnetic-spin coefficients into the
        Heaviside gravity equations and the Maxwell field equations.
        This provides for a relationship between the gravitational and
        electrical components, as well as between the magnetic and
        rotational components in a given medium. The assumptions are
        built around a special model of inhomogenous physical vacuum,
        called the vacuum domain model (2). It is suggested that the
        extra relationships are absent outside the vacuum domain.
        Although it is difficult to imagine a long-living vacuum domain,
        the proposed model provides for a satisfactory explanation (at
        least on a qualitative phenomenological level) for the
        appearance of emission, the system weight variations, and the
        conversion of energy taken from the surrounding medium into the
        rotational mechanical moment of the rollers. Unfortunately, the
        theory cannot provide a physical pattern of the observed
        phenomena. </p>
      <p><b>Conclusion ~</b> </p>
      <p>At present, the work on a developed variant of the converter
        are in progress at the Glushko "NPE Energomash" company
        (Moscow). This setup would allow a deeper insight into the
        physics of observed phenomena. Another aim is the creation of
        commercial samples for various practical applications. </p>

      <p>FIELD OF THE INVENTION </p>
      <p>This invention relates generally to the field of direct current
        electrical motors and generators that operate without the need
        for commutation and/or rectification, and more particularly to
        multi-rotor homopolar machines which derive their emf
        (electromotive force) from co-rotational magnets and metallic
        disk embodiment. </p>
      <p>BACKGROUND </p>
      <p>Back in 1831, Michael Faraday discovered that a cylindrical
        magnet suspended by a string and touching a mercury bath at the
        bottom could generate electricity while spinning along its axis
        if a second electrical contact was made at the periphery of the
        midpoint of the magnet. His experiment was a one-piece homopolar
        machine since the magnet and conductor were joined together.
        Such Faraday generators have also been called acyclic, unipolar
        or homopolar generators because no commutation or alternating of
        the magnetic poles is necessary for this machine in order to
        generate electricity. </p>
      <p>The type of electrical output is most often direct current (DC)
        unless specific means are designed to provide an interruption of
        radial conduction and thus simulate alternating current (AC).
        Historically, DC was championed by Thomas Edison during the
        early part of the 20th century while at the same time AC was
        championed by Nikola Tesla and George Westinghouse. In the
        future, DC will be coming back into style with the emergence of
        ambient temperature superconductive cables. Therefore, highly
        efficient homopolar generators will be in demand to meet the
        future market demand for DC electricity. </p>
      <p>Homopolar generators usually have a single disk or drum
        rotating in a stationary magnetic field with sliding contacts.
        The sliding contacts often present high resistance however. The
        construction and operation of homopolar machines for electric
        propulsion of marine vessels or railguns for example is already
        well known. Such machines include motors and generators wherein
        electrical current flows through a conductor situated in a
        magnetic field during rotation of the machine rotor. </p>
      <p>In the case of a homopolar motor, the current will develop a
        J.times.B force perpendicular to the direction of its flow
        through the conductor and that of the magnetic field. In the
        case of a homopolar generator, a voltage dependent on the
        rotational speed, magnetic field, and radius, is induced in a
        conductor moving within the magnetic field. When current is
        drawn from the homopolar generator, it also develops a J.times.B
        force for the same reason as with the motor but is referred to
        as back torque or armature reaction. General reference
        information including basic principles used to reduce back

        (ISBN 0-9641070-1-5). </p>
      <p>The prior art rarely includes a one-piece homopolar machines
        that rotate the magnet with the disk. Even more unknown is the
        concept of rolling contacts. Eliminating sliding contacts is
        shown in the "Planetary Homopolar Generator," IBM Technical
        Disklosure Bulletin, Vol. 17, No. 6, p. 1786-87, November, 1974,
        H. D. Varadarajan. </p>
      <p>Using a conducting belt or rolling contacts to gather current
        from a magnetic field flux cutting rotor, there is an annular
        magnetic field through which the rotor executes a planetary
        motion. </p>
      <p>The large stresses resulting from the centrifugal force of the
        massive, unbalanced planetary rotor is a distinct disadvantage,
        prohibiting high speed operation. Thus, only a low rate of
        rotation is possible with the IBM design. </p>
      <p>The "Direct Current Homopolar Machine" U.S. Pat. No. 5,587,618
        to Hathaway demonstrates an analogous concept of relative motion
        between conductive orbiting shaft and a stationary disk-shaped
        magnetized armature. </p>
      <p>However, the design is a bit cumbersome to be practical.
        Science Applications International Corporation claims a
        conductive belt, dual disk "Homopolar Motor-Generator" in U.S.
        Pat. No. 5,241,232 to Reed that apparently reinvents the "Dynamo
        Electric Machine" of U.S. Pat. No. 406,968 patented by none
        other than Nikola Tesla in 1889 that also has two unipolar
        magnetized rotors connected by a conductive belt. The belted
        dual unipolar machines solve one of the problems that plague the
        field by offering two sliding contacts at the low speed surface
        on the axle. However, the present invention requires only one
        sliding contact on the axle. These conductive belt machines also
        demonstrate, in principle, the concept of a multi-rotor,
        planetary design, by the process of coordinate transformation,
        since relative motion is the key to the operation of a homopolar
        generator. The concept of rolling contact is demonstrated with
        the Dalen "Dynamo Electric Machine" U.S. Pat. No. 645,943, where
        two disks are turning in opposite directions while in contact
        with each other at their periphery. However, the axle of each
        disk must remain fixed in place whereas each axle is in orbiting
        motion in the present invention. </p>
      <p>Homopolar machines can reversibly function as motors as well,
        such as flywheels, and used as energy storage devices. First
        used in transportation applications in the 1950's, flywheel
        powered buses were designed to have the flywheel accelerated at
        every stop. Composite rotors currently have been developed which
        can spin at very high revolutions (100,000 revolutions per
        second); and the speed is limited by the tensile strength of the
        rim of the rotor. By using a multi-rotor design, the centrifugal
        forces of a large disk can be greatly reduced and still maintain
        high-energy storage or production. By using magnetic bearings,
        the friction on the axis of the rotor can be reduced
        sufficiently so that such rotors can maintain most of the energy
        for several days. </p>
      <p>The IBM Varadarajan planetary rotor is unbalanced and has a low
        rate of magnetic flux cutting due to its annular magnetic field
        design. The Hathaway direct current machine has a lot of
        unbalanced conductive material orbiting the central magnetized
        disk which limits the rotational speed. </p>
      <p>The conductive belt designs can be subject to oxidation and
        slippage, even requiring a toothed timing belt on each axle as
        well. With most disk models of homopolar generators, as opposed
        to drum designs, sliding contacts are the single most important
        contribution of resistance inhibiting the power output of the
        machine. Internal resistance is the only limit to the output
        capability of a homopolar generator and it is important to
        reduce all sources of internal resistance to obtain maximum
        power output for a given input torque. Rather than use high
        resistance carbon brushes, medium resistance silver-graphite
        brushes or dangerous conductive liquids such as mercury, low
        temperature solder, or sodium-potassium, there is a need to
        eliminate frictional sliding contact at the high speed periphery
        of the magnetized rotor completely. Furthermore, rather than
        maintaining two sliding contacts which contribute friction and
        resistance, even in the rolling and belted designs, there is a
        need to cut the number in half to only one high current sliding
        contact. The present invention satisfies both of these needs. </p>
      <p>SUMMARY </p>
      <p>The present invention derives direct current electricity by
        co-rotating a plurality of magnets and a metallic disk. It
        comprises an improved homopolar machine with dynamically
        balancing, axially parallel, cylindrical, electrically
        conductive magnets arranged circumferentially around the
        vertical axis of central stator ring. Such a design can be
        referred to as distributed generation since each magnet rotor
        generates only a fraction of the current that is transmitted
        through the machine. Thus, the conductive bearings contacting
        the center of each end of the magnet rotors may carry only one
        tenth or less of the total current. </p>
      <p>The multi-rotor orbiting homopolar also does not include
        sliding contacts at each magnetized rotor rim but instead
        utilizes a suitable rolling means attached separately to magnets
        and also to the stator ring for intimately contacting and
        engaging non-slip rolling between magnets and stator as they
        orbit around the stator. The magnetized rotors maintain
        rotational synchronism and equal relative position to each other
        with a bearing means rotatably securing the top and bottom end
        of each magnet to a corresponding electrically conductive
        circular endplate. </p>
      <p>The electrical energy is extracted, or input if used as a
        motor, through contacts on the conductive stator and at the
        machine's electrically conductive axle located in the center of
        the machine while rigidly attached to the top circular endplate
        that rotates with all of the individually magnetized rotors. The
        only single, high current, moving contact that is required is an
        electrically conductive thrust bearing that supports the central
        axle. An insulating thrust bearing meanwhile separates the axle
        from the center of bottom circular endplate. The stator, which
        is of course stationary, accomplishes the second contact means
        through a standard electrical connection with no need for any
        relative motion sliding contact. The stator may be optionally
        magnetized in the opposite direction to the magnetized rotors in
        order to increase the coercive force or magnetic flux density. </p>
      <p>The drawings constitute a part of this specification and
        include exemplary embodiments to the invention, which may be
        embodied in various forms. It is to be understood that in some
        instances various aspects of the invention may be shown
        exaggerated or enlarged to facilitate an understanding of the
        invention. </p>
      <p><i>The Problem ~</i> </p>
      <p>The problem this invention solves is that it generates high
        power direct current electricity without the need for
        commutation and rectification, otherwise the internal resistance
        losses are high. </p>
      <p>The problems with prior art devices, processes and systems can
        be categorized as follows. </p>
      <p>1. Require commutation or rectification to generate direct
        current electricity. </p>
      <p>2. Rely on more than one current brush which often have high
        speed contact. </p>
      <p>3. Do not distribute magnetic field power generation by
        multi-rotor orbiting magnets in homopolar machines or systems. </p>
      <p>4. Internal resistance losses are usually high. </p>
      <p>5. Neither efficient nor cost effective. </p>
      <p>6. Neither simple nor practical for most applications. </p>
      <p><i>Prior Art ~</i> </p>
      <p>A preliminary limited prior art search was not commissioned but
        the inventor is intimately familiar with the prior art.

      <p>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE BEST MODE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </p>
      <p>As shown in the drawings wherein like numerals represent like
        parts throughout the several views, there is generally disclosed
        in FIG. 1 is a state of the prior art. </p>
      <p>Detailed descriptions of the preferred embodiment are provided
        herein. It is to be understood, however, that the present
        invention may be embodied in various forms. Therefore, specific
        details disclosed herein are not to be interpreted as limiting,
        but rather as a basis for the claims and as a representative
        basis for teaching one skilled in the art to employ the present
        invention in virtually any appropriately detailed system,
        structure or manner. </p>
      <p>Turning first to FIG. 2 there is shown a perspective cutaway
        view of a portion of one embodiment of the present invention
        showing one of a multitude of rotors that are axially magnetized
        (B). This multitude mounted in parallel comprise the multi-rotor
        homopolar machine in close contact with a ring shaped stator
        that may be optionally magnetized in the direction opposite to
        the magnetic fields of the rotors. </p>
      <p>Each rotor 20 has its own axle 21 which is circumferentially
        mounted vertically, arranged and dynamically balanced around a
        central vertical axis, on an electrically conductive but low
        permeability axle rod 21 made of copper, brass or bronze, that
        may penetrate the center of the entire magnetized rotor and
        rotatably attach to top and bottom bearing 33 on circular
        endplates 31, 32 shown in FIG. 3. In operation, the rotors orbit
        around the circular stator ring, which may or may not also be
        magnetized. </p>
      <p>The invention is more completely shown in the elevational view
        of FIG. 3 with several rotors 20 rotatably attached to the top
        circular endplate 31 and bottom circular endplate 32 by
        electrically conductive bearings 33. The top endplate 31 is
        rigidly attached to the central axle 34 supporting the orbiting
        multi-rotor homopolar generator assembly. The hollow circular
        design of the stationary ring stator 23 is also visible in FIG.
        3, which can be optionally magnetized to increase performance
        output. </p>
      <p>The bottom circular endplate 32 has a large hole in the center,
        more completely seen in FIG. 4, that allows inner attachment to
        insulating bearing 44 which optimally can be a non-contacting,
        low friction magnetic bearing since the weight of the rotor
        assembly is carried by the electrically conductive thrust
        bearing 41. The bottom endplate 32 is thus isolated electrically
        from the stationary Inner cylinder 43 that is the inner core of
        the stator. Inner circular assembly plates 49 of equal size and
        shape, that preferably are electrically conductive, rigidly
        attach the inner cylinder 43 to the stator ring 23. In
        accordance with the present invention, FIG. 4 shows the side
        cross sectional view edge on with a cutaway so that the central
        axle 34 and hollow inner cylinder design 43 is visible. </p>
      <p>The insulating bearings 42 separate the central axle 34 from
        the inner cylinder 43. Both bearings 42 and 44 electrically
        maintain the separation of polarity of the electromotive force
        (emf) voltage of each rotor. The positive or negative polarity
        of the conductors depends of course on the rotation direction of
        the rotor magnets. One conductor 45 is electrically emerging
        from the stator assembly and ultimately emanates from the outer
        edge of each rotor 20 with the homopolar effect conducting the
        generated electricity through the rolling means 47 and 48. The
        opposite polarity conductor 46 is electrically emanating from
        the center axle 21 of each rotor 20 is connected to the
        electrically conductive thrust bearing 41. </p>
      <p>In accordance with an important function of the present
        invention, there is shown in FIG. 4 one embodiment of an
        intimately contacting and engaging nonslip rolling means 47 and
        48. As is well-known in the industry where good traction with a
        high coefficient of friction (1.6 or better) but sufficiently
        low electrical resistance is desired between two surfaces, an
        adherent coating of copper can be used on both facing surfaces
        of the stator 23 and rotor 20. For the copper coating,
        electro-deposition can be used or flame spraying of copper on
        the rotor and stator outer surfaces. </p>
      <p>Another embodiment of rolling means 47 and 48 utilizes a geared
        electromechanical rotary joint developed by NASA Goddard Space
        Center (NASA Tech Briefs, December, 1994) which offers the
        advantage of a springy, low noise planetary gear contacting a
        stator ring gear. It was designed by NASA to overcome the
        disadvantages of sliding contacts and to ensure high traction
        desired for rolling electrical contacts. </p>
      <p>The springy gears are made from beryllium copper which is a
        self-cleaning material with, in one embodiment, an average
        diameter of 6.35 mm with any reasonable number of teeth. Another
        concept to creating a rolling contact utilizes a magnetic
        sprocket design with small rare earth (samarium cobalt for
        example) magnets embedded perpendicularly in the surfaces of the
        stator ring and rotor magnets. The magnetic sprocket thus
        utilizes equally spaced magnets mounted normal to the axes of
        the stator and rotor. </p>
      <p>To demonstrate an important feature of the invention, there is
        shown in FIG. 5 a plan view from the top of the balanced
        distribution of the rotors 20 around the stator assembly 43 with
        the outer stator ring 23 that are equally spaced and preferably
        dynamically balanced so the centrifugal forces are equal and
        opposite. </p>
      <p><i>Theory of Operation ~</i> </p>
      <p>The main principle of operation is based on the fact that
        rotating cylindrical magnets creates a homopolar emf generation
        from Faraday's Law and the Lorentz Force. Physically, a
        rotating, non-inertial reference frame configuration can only be
        analyzed correctly with Einstein's general theory of relativity,
        utilizing a Thirring metric. </p>
      <p>Particularly, where rotating cylindrical magnets and disk are
        synchronized and made co-rotational, such a co-rotational
        configuration makes the generator one piece like the earth's
        magnetic field itself. As the inventors explored this
        correspondence more closely, it was learned that the earth's
        molten, electrically conductive iron core also includes not one
        but several vortices in a coaxial circular arrangement. The
        inventors stumbled upon this concept while investigating the
        field rotation paradox and found that an orbiting, multi-rotor
        homopolar generator assembly would be analogous to the earth's
        electrically conductive, multi-vortex, magnetic, molten iron
        core. </p>
      <p>The field rotation paradox can be easily resolved by an amateur
        DIY (Do It Yourself ) scientist by comparing the interception of
        a linear magnetic field vs. a rotating magnetic field. In the
        former configuration the meter gives the same reading whether
        the magnet is moved with respect to a pickup coil of wire or
        vice versa but in the latter configuration the meter reading is
        seen only when the disk is moved with respect to rotary magnetic
        field of cylindrical magnet but not when the magnet is moved
        with respect to the disk. The former is consistent with special
        relativity while the latter is relying on general relativity.
        Both are loosely termed "relativistic." </p>
      <p><i>Assembly and Use ~</i> </p>
      <p>The manufacturing, assembly and use of this invention is very
        simple even intuitive. The system of this invention can be
        readily assembled from the teaching provided in this disclosure
        by state of the art techniques and materials by a person of
        average skill in the art. </p>
      <p>The applicant has described the essence of this invention.
        While this invention has been described with reference to an
        illustrative embodiment, this description is not intended to be
        construed in a limiting sense. Various modifications and
        combinations of the illustrative embodiments as well as other
        embodiments of the invention will be apparent to a person of
        average skill in the art upon reference to this description. </p>
      <p><i>Variations ~</i> </p>
      <p>Due to the simplicity and elegance of the design of this

      The Morningstar Energy Box (Tuesday, March 15, 4:30 PM)
      SPESIF-COFE4 Presentation. 2011<br>
      <br>
      SPESIF-COFE 4 Abstract. The Morningstar Energy Box is a derivative
      of a Searl device modified in a similar fashion used by the
      Russian Scientists Godin and Roschin. These devices use laminated
      rollers and a main ring made of different materials used to
      enhance electrical and magnetic properties. Where the Searl device
      uses rollers to move around a main ring, the Russian device
      kinematically constrains these rollers within a mechanical cage.
      The operational theory for the Energy Box uses rotating
      electromagnetic fields to create gravitational effects and is
      different from those theories outlined by either Searl or the
      Russians. A prototype device is currently under test and
      unfortunately self-accelerated motion has yet to be obtained. The
      Russians have made several serious claims that their device
      produced self-acceleration to generate electricity, created a
      relatively large weight loss, generated discrete walls of
      magnetism far from the device and that a temperature drop exists
      when the device loses weight. To date, no one has validated these
      outrageous claims. However, we have found similar phenomenon
      regarding temperature loss and the discrete magnetic walls to
      occur during tests of the Energy Box and have correlated the
      temperature drop that the Godin &amp; Roschin device produces as
      being a consequence of the Unruh effect. Where they claimed to
      lose as much as 35% of the weight of a 375 kg armature, the Energy
      Box only loses as much as 2% of its 490 pounds at this stage of
      the test cycle. Additional tests and modifications are underway to
      hopefully increase the weight loss.<br>
