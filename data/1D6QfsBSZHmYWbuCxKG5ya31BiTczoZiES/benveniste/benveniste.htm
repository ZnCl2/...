    <div style="margin-left: 80px;"><br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Jacques Benveniste</span> (March
      12, 1935–October 3, 2004) was a French immunologist. In 1979 he
      published a well-known paper on the structure of
      platelet-activating factor and its relationship with histamine. He
      was head of INSERM's Unit 200, directed at immunology, allergy and
      inflammation.<br>
      <br>
      Benveniste was at the center of a major international controversy
      in 1988, when he published a paper in the prestigious scientific
      journal Nature describing the action of very high dilutions of
      anti-IgE antibody on the degranulation of human basophils,
      findings which seemed to support the concept of homeopathy.
      Biologists were puzzled by Benveniste's results, as only molecules
      of water, and no molecules of the original antibody, remained in
      these high dilutions. Benveniste concluded that the configuration
      of molecules in water was biologically active; a journalist coined
      the term water memory for this hypothesis. Much later, in the
      nineties, Benveniste also asserted that this "memory" could be
      digitized, transmitted, and reinserted into another sample of
      water, which would then contain the same active qualities as the
      first sample.<br>
      <br>
      As a condition for publication, Nature asked for the results to be
      replicated by independent laboratories. The controversial paper
      published in Nature was eventually co-authored by four
      laboratories worldwide, in Canada, Italy, Israel, and in France
      [1]. After the article was published, a follow-up investigation
      was set up by a team including physicist and Nature editor John
      Maddox, illusionist and well-known skeptic James Randi, as well as
      fraud expert Walter Stewart who had recently raised suspicion on
      the work of Nobel Laureate David Baltimore [2]. With the
      cooperation of Benveniste's own team, the group failed to
      replicate the original results, and subsequent investigations did
      not support Benveniste's findings either. Benveniste refused to
      retract his controversial article, and he explained (notably in
      letters to Nature) that the protocol used in these investigations
      was not identical to his own. However, his reputation was damaged,
      so he began to fund his research himself as his external sources
      of funding were withdrawn. In 1997, he founded the company DigiBio
      to "develop and commercialise applications of Digital Biology."<br>
      <br>
      Benveniste died in Paris at the age of 69 after heart surgery. He
      was married twice and had five children.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Nature publication and
        investigation --Unusual conditions</span><br style="font-weight:
        bold;">
      <br>
      Nature agreed to publish Benveniste's article in June 1988 with
      two unusual conditions: first, that Benveniste obtain prior
      confirmation of his results from other laboratories;[citation
      needed] second, that a team selected by Nature be allowed to
      investigate his laboratory following publication. Benveniste
      accepted these conditions; the results were replicated by four
      laboratories, in Milan, Italy; in Toronto, Canada; in Tel-Aviv,
      Israel and in Marseille, France.[citation needed]<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Unusual disclaimer</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Following replication, the article was then published in <span
        style="font-style: italic;">Nature</span>, which printed an
      editorial titled "When to believe the unbelievable" in the same
      issue of the journal and attached the following disclaimer to the
      article: "Editorial reservation: Readers of this article may share
      the incredulity of the many referees. . . There is no physical
      basis for such an activity. . . <span style="font-style: italic;">Nature</span>
      has therefore arranged for independent investigators to observe
      repetitions of the experiments." The last time such a disclaimer
      had been added was in 1974 to an article on Uri Geller.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Critical investigation</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      A week after publication of the article, <span style="font-style:
        italic;">Nature</span> sent a team of three investigators to
      Benveniste's lab to attempt to replicate his results under
      controlled conditions. The team consisted of Nature editor and
      physicist Sir John Maddox, American scientific fraud investigator
      and chemist Walter Stewart, and skeptic and former magician James
      Randi.<br>
      <br>
      The team pored over the laboratory's records and oversaw seven
      attempts to replicate Benveniste's study. Three of the first four
      attempts turned out somewhat favorable to Benveniste; however the
      <span style="font-style: italic;">Nature</span> team was not
      satisfied with the rigor of the methodology. Benveniste invited
      them to design a double blind procedure, which they did, and
      conducted three more attempts. Before fully revealing the results,
      the team asked if there were any complaints about the procedure,
      but none were brought up. These stricter attempts turned out
      negative for Benveniste. In response to Benveniste's refusal to
      withdraw his claims, the team published in the July 1988 edition
      of <span style="font-style: italic;">Nature</span> [3] the
      following critiques of Benveniste's original study:<br>
      <br>
      1. Benveniste's experiments were "statistically ill-controlled",
      and the lab displayed unfamiliarity with the concept of sampling
      error. The method of taking control values was not reliable, and
      "no substantial effort has been made to exclude systematic error,
      including observer bias"<br>
      <br>
      2. "interpretation has been clouded by the exclusion of
      measurements in conflict with the claim". In particular, blood
      that failed to degranulate was "recorded but not included in
      analyses prepared for publication". In addition, the experiment
      sometimes completely failed to work for "periods of several
      months".<br>
      <br>
      3. There was insufficient "avoidance of contamination", and, to a
      large extent, "the source of blood for the experiments is not
      controlled".<br>
      <br>
      4. The study had not disclosed that "the salaries of two of Dr
      Benveniste's coauthors of the published article are paid for under
      a contract between INSERM 200 and the French company Boiron et
      Cie."<br>
      <br>
      5. "The phenomenon described is not reproducible". "We believe
      that experimental data have been uncritically assessed and their
      imperfections inadequately reported."<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Response</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      In the same issue of the journal <span style="font-style:
        italic;">Nature</span>, and in subsequent commentary, Benveniste
      derided the <span style="font-style: italic;">Nature</span>
      team's "mockery of scientific inquiry" and warned other scientists
      not to permit such investigations into their own labs.[citation
      needed] He claimed that such "Salem witchhunts or McCarthy-like
      prosecutions will kill science." Some of his criticisms included:<br>
      <br>
      1. "Lip service is paid to our honesty; yet accusation of cheating
      was rampant". For example, the <span style="font-style: italic;">Nature</span>
      team implied that the lab's partial funding from the homeopathy
      industry was cause for concern, even though industry funding -
      both homeopathic and non-homeopathic - of research is commonplace.<br>
      <br>
      2. The team of non-biologists displayed "amateurism", failed to
      "get to grips with our biological system", created an atmosphere
      of "constant suspicion", and their member James Randi played
      tricks and pulled stunts such as taping information to the ceiling
      to prevent tampering.<br>
      <br>
      3. The team arrived without a prior plan, and based on one week of
      work "would blot out five years of our work and that of five other
      laboratories".<br>
      <br>
      4. The blinded attempts likely failed due to "erratic controls",
      the excessive work-load, and the team's experimental design.<br>
      <br>
      5. Benveniste totally rejected the team's allegations of
      unfamiliarity with sampling error, and of the unreliability of his
      control values.[3]<br>

        Benveniste's results</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Academy of Sciences</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      In 1991, Benveniste found the French Academy of Sciences willing
      to publish his latest results, obtained under the supervision of a
      statistician, in its weekly Proceedings. Eric Fottorino writing in
      Le Monde relates how the remorseful Academy of Science noticed
      that an earlier edition contained a study critical of the memory
      of water. Seizing on this opportunity, the Academy ordered the
      printing to stop and the already printed copies destroyed, so that
      it could print a revised edition, in which Benveniste's article
      was labeled a mere "right of reply" - downgraded from the status
      of an article.<br>
      <br>
      Although the new findings fell substantially short of confirming
      the patterns previously claimed by Benveniste, writer Yves Lignon
      quotes study co-author and statistician Alfred Spira, who said
      that "the transmission of information persisted at high dilution",
      and acknowledged that a "weakness in the experimental procedure
      was possible".<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ovelgonne et al.</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      A group of Dutch researchers reported their failure to duplicate
      the results in Experientia in 1992:<br>
      <br>
      "In fact, in our hands no effect of extreme dilutions was shown at
      all. We conclude that the effect of extreme dilutions of anti-IgE,
      reported by Davenas et al., needs further clarification and that
      in this process the reproducibility of results between
      experimenters should be carefully determined."<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Hirst et al.</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      A group of English researchers reported another failure to
      duplicate the results in Nature in 1993:<br>
      <br>
      "Following as closely as possible the methods of the original
      study, we can find no evidence for any periodic or polynomial
      change of degranulation as a function of anti-IgE dilution."<br>
      <br>
      However, Benveniste in a 1994 letter to <span style="font-style:
        italic;">Nature</span> argued that the study neglected to
      faithfully follow his methods. The study has also been criticized
      on the grounds that its results were more favourable to
      Benveniste's claims than the study authors acknowledged in their
      conclusion.[4][5]<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Josephson and the APS</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Benveniste gained the public support[6] of Brian Josephson, a
      Nobel physicist with a reputation for openness to paranormal
      claims. Time magazine reported in 1999 that, in response to
      skepticism from physicist Robert Park, Josephson had challenged
      the American Physical Society (APS) to oversee a replication by
      Benveniste, using "a randomized double-blind test", of his claimed
      ability to transfer the characteristics of homeopathically diluted
      water over the Internet. The APS accepted and offered to cover the
      costs of the test, and Benveniste wrote "fine by us" in his
      DigiBio NewsLetter in response to Randi's offer to throw in the $1
      million challenge prize-money if the test succeeded. However,
      Randi in his Commentary notes that Benveniste and Josephson did
      not follow up on their challenge.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ennis et al.</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      An article published in <span style="font-style: italic;">Inflammation












        Research</span> in 2004 brought new media attention to the issue
      with this claim:<br>
      <br>
      "In 3 different types of experiment, it has been shown that high
      dilutions of histamine may indeed exert an effect on basophil
      activity. This activity observed by staining basophils with alcian
      blue was confirmed by flow cytometry. Inhibition by histamine was
      reversed by anti-H2 and was not observed with histidine these
      results being in favour of the specificity of this effect We are
      however unable to explain our findings and are reporting them to
      encourage others to investigate this phenomenon."[7]<br>
      <br>
      Following up on a study they had published in 1999 in the same
      journal, the researchers concluded that an effect did exist. Some
      of the researchers had not been involved in homeopathic research
      before, while others had, such as former Benveniste collaborator
      Philippe Belon, Research Director at the homeopathic company
      Boiron. It was Madeleine Ennis who received the most attention in
      the media. Ennis led the activities at the British lab, with other
      labs in Europe, running a variation of Benveniste's water memory
      experiments. Ennis states that she began the research as a
      skeptic, but concluded that the "results compel me to suspend my
      disbelief and start searching for rational explanations for our
      findings."[8]<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">BBC Horizon</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      In 2002 <span style="font-style: italic;">BBC Horizon</span>
      broadcast its failed attempt to win James Randi's $1 million prize
      to prove that a highly diluted substance could still have an
      effect. Prominent spokespersons on both sides of the debate were
      interviewed, including Benveniste. See water memory.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Digital Biology</span><br>
      <br>
      With the support of Brian Josephson, increasingly odd experiments
      continued, culminating in a 1997 paper claiming a water memory
      effect could be transmitted over phone lines.[9] This culminated
      in two additional papers in 1999[10] and another on
      remote-transmission in 2000.[11]<br>
      <br>
      Intrigued by Benveniste's claims that biological interactions
      could be digitized, the US Defence Advanced Research Projects
      Agency (DARPA) asked Dr. Wayne Jonas, homeopath and then director
      of the US National Center for Complementary and Alternative
      Medicine, to organize an attempt at independently replicating the
      claimed results. An independent test of the 2000
      remote-transmission experiment was carried out in the USA by a
      team funded by the US Department of Defense. Using the same
      experimental devices and setup as the Benveniste team, they failed
      to find any effect when running the experiment. Several positive
      results were noted, but only when a particular one of Benveniste's
      researchers was running the equipment. Benveniste admitted to
      having noticed this himself, and offered a variety of reasons to
      explain away what appeared to be another example of experimenter
      effect. The experiment is also notable for the way it attempted to
      avoid the confrontational nature of the earlier Maddox test.[12]
      The study implemented "A social and communication management
      process that was capable of dealing with conflicting interpersonal
      dynamics among vested parties in the research effort." One of
      Benveniste's machines was used, and, in the design and pilot
      project phase in 2001, Benveniste and other members of his DigiBio
      lab participated as consultants. Interviews at the time indicated
      study participants were satisfied with the way the study was being
      conducted. In the end, the authors reported in the FASEB Journal
      in 2006 that "Our team found no replicable effects from digital
      signals".<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">INSERM</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      The July 1989 edition of <span style="font-style: italic;">Nature</span>
      reported that INSERM placed Benveniste on probation following a
      routine evaluation of his lab. Although INSERM found that his
      laboratory activities overall were exemplary, it expressed severe
      discomfort with his high dilution studies, and criticized him for
      "an insufficiently critical analysis of the results he reported,
      the cavalier character of the interpretations he made of them, and
      the abusive use of his scientific authority vis-à-vis his
      informing of the public".[13]<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Benveniste and homeopathy</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Nearly all conventional scientists believe that there is no
      credible evidence to support claims that homeopathic remedies
      actually work, nor is there a plausible mechanism to explain how
      homeopathy could work.[14] Indeed, skeptics often dismiss
      homeopathy out of hand, citing internal inconsistencies in the
      hypothesis, and the fact that biological reactions require the
      presence of chemicals, whereas homeopathic remedies are so diluted
      that they are equivalent to pure water. Homeopathists respond to
      the latter that this is a straw man argument, since they have long
      acknowledged the absence of chemicals in their products.
      Homeopathists have instead based their claims on some other
      yet-to-be-discovered mechanism.<br>
      <br>
      Benveniste's 1988 article attracted attention in large part
      because it hinted at a potential mechanism that could be used by
      proponents of homeopathy to explain how homeopathy might work.
      This is the idea that water may somehow retain a memory of a
      substance that it no longer contains.<br>
      <br>
      Conventionally, pure water is pure water, regardless of whether it
      once contained a substance in the past. Benveniste challenged this
      convention by claiming that water that had once contained
      antibodies but had had them removed could affect a basophil just
      as if the water still contained antibodies.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Miscellaneous</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Benveniste has been awarded two Ig Nobel Prizes in Chemistry. They
      are a parody of the Nobel Prizes. The first in 1991 describes
      Jacques Benveniste as a "prolific proselytizer and dedicated
      correspondent of Nature, for his persistent belief that water,
      H2O, is an intelligent liquid, and for demonstrating to his
      satisfaction that water is able to remember events long after all
      trace of those events has vanished." The second in 1998 cites "his
      homeopathic discovery that not only does water have memory, but
      that the information can be transmitted over telephone lines and
      the Internet."[15]<br>

        Abstract</span> -- A method and a device for transmitting and
      processing a signal representative of the biological activity or
      behaviour specific to a predetermined substance, from a first
      carrier material having said biological activity to a second
      material physically separate from the first and free at first of
      any physical presence of said predetermined substance, as well as
      the material resulting from such a method, are disclosed. The
      method comprises amplifying the electrical or electromagnetic
      signal transmitted by the first substance and sensed by a sensor,
      and transmitting, to a transmitter, a signal representative of the
      biological activity or behaviour of the first material, then
      sensing in the second material a signal representative of the
      biological activity specific to said predetermined substance, and
      transmitted to said second material via high gain amplification
      means.<br>
      <br>
      Present invention relates to a method and an apparatus of
      transmission in the form of a signal of the biological activity or
      specific biological behavior with a determined substance, starting
      from a carrying first material presenting the aforementioned
      biological activity, with a second initially free carrier material
      of any physical presence of the aforesaid determined substance. It
      also relates to an obtained product with such a method.<br>
      <br>
      By “biological activity” one more conveniently understands any
      activity capable to be exerted by a biological substance with
      regard to an other substance refer target.<br>
      <br>
      The target can be single or complex, such as for example a
      molecule, a body, a living being, in particular when the
      biological activity concerned does not imply the performing of a
      stable chemical bond between substance and the target.<br>
      <br>
      The specific biological activity can be that of a natural
      substance or that of an artificial substance created by the man.<br>
      <br>
      The expression “substance” such as it is used here for reasons of
      convenience of language, should not be regarded as applying only
      to one pure or individualized chemical molecule. It also must and
      particularly to be heard as including any complex reagent capable
      to express a biological activity which would be specific to the
      whole of the elements of which the reagent could be made up.<br>
      <br>
      Like indicated right now above, and in short, it thus results, by
      what precedes that the expression “target” must as for it also be
      taken in its widest direction, to be operable as well and,
      according to case's, &lt; as examples) for an individualized
      molecule, for example a specific substrate of an enzyme, when this
      one constitutes aforesaid “substance”, and for a body a living
      being when it is in its connection that “the biological activity”
      of “substance” to the study is tested.<br>
      <br>
      The invention particularly finds an applying important although
      nonexclusive in the field of the manufacture of homeopathic drugs
      presenting a biological activity corresponding one at one or more
      active principles.<br>
      <br>
      The invention puts at profit an extraordinary property of the
      material which was clarified by a certain number of experiments
      whose results are further described, namely that it is possible to
      transmit by electronic means or electromagnetic the expression of
      a specific biological activity of a material presenting it at
      another material not presenting initially the aforementioned
      activity.<br>
      <br>
      The physical base of the method in accordance with the invention
      is still unknown. Perhaps it is explained by the following
      assumption: the manifestation of any biological activity of
      molecular origin would implement at the very least partially,
      activity of an electrical or electromagnetic type.<br>
      <br>
      Observations as the inhibition of the biological activity by a
      magnetic field consolidate this assumption, [L.Hadji, B. Arnoux,

      <br>
      With this aim the invention proposes particularly a transmission
      method in the form of a characteristic signal of the manifestation
      of the biological activity or specific biological behavior with a
      determined substance, starting from a carrying first material
      presenting the aforementioned biological activity at a second
      material physically separated from the first material and
      initially free of any physical presence of the aforesaid
      determined substance, this method comprising at the same time the
      exposure respectively carrying first material, presenting the
      biological activity, with a signal sensor electrical or
      electromagnetic, and the exposure of the second electrical or
      electromagnetic material to a signal transmitter, connected to the
      sensor via transmitting means and of amplifying with high profit,
      pendent a sufficient time to allow - amplifying of the
      electromagnetic electrical signal collected by the sensor and the
      transmission with the transmitter of a characteristic signal of
      the manifestation of the biological activity or biological
      behavior presented by the first material, - detection in the
      second material of a characteristic signal of the manifestation of
      the specific biological activity with the aforementioned substance
      determined and transmitted to this second material via the
      amplifying means with high profit.<br>
      <br>
      The detection of the manifestation characteristic of the activity
      or the specific biological behavior of determined substance is
      révélable by the action which the transmitted signal can exert on
      a substrate (organism or reagents) at the time the implementation
      of a tentative protocol adapted to make identical or similar with
      that normally allowing the setting in evidence of the presence in
      the first material carrying of the aforesaid determined substance,
      thanks to the action exerted by this last on the same substrate.<br>
      <br>
      The transmitting means and of amplifying with high profit comprise
      a medium or carrier medium suitable to convey a coherent flow of
      information to electromagnetic or electrical characters. This
      medium includes/understands for example a conducting cable of the
      electricity or means allowing the exploitation of a light beam
      carrier of coherent light.<br>
      <br>
      By “amplifying means at high one sheathed hears characterized
      means by a coefficient of amplifying of an electrical signal or
      electromagnetic important, particularly great at 1000 and
      preferably great to 10.000.<br>
      <br>
      For example the tension is amplified of 100 microvolts to 6 Volts
      and, simultaneously the intensity of 100nA with 150 my.<br>
      <br>
      As an indication, one will mention that with such apparatuses of
      transmission and amplifying with high profit, the higher durations
      are at least about 10 mn, with preferably about 15 minutes.<br>
      <br>
      Also advantageously the first and/or the second carrier material
      are, or contain, of said solvents “protonic”, i.e. capable to
      release and/or collect protons, such as for example water, the
      ethanol or any product presenting a linked labile proton at an
      electronegative atom, of formula of the type R - X - H.<br>
      <br>
      Advantageously, the carrying first material and/or the second
      carrier material are specifically of water, or the aqueous
      products.<br>
      <br>
      It can (or they can) be consisted all impregnatable materials by
      water, same if this one is present only in low proportions.<br>
      <br>
      In the case of water, this one is advantageously consisted
      distilled water, which previously was heated at a great
      temperature with about 70 " C pendent a great time with about 20
      minutes.<br>
      <br>
      Advantageously single of the electromagnetic signals are
      collected, amplified and transmitted between the sensor and the
      transmitter.<br>
      <br>
      In an advantageous embodiment the method in accordance with the
      invention is applied with the water treatment, for example with
      the depollution of used or biologically contaminated water.<br>
      <br>
      Still advantageously the second material is a living material, for
      example a nonhuman body.<br>
      <br>
      Advantageously the transmitted signal is stored in an intermediate
      way (before being transmitted to the second material) on an
      electromagnetic storage medium of known type in him same, like a
      magnetic tape, or after processing by an analogue/digital
      converter on a digital storage medium such as an optical disc, a
      computerized memory etc<br>
      <br>
      Also advantageously the transmitted signal is treated by known
      methods of treatment digital or analogue into they-same, in order
      to be modified and to thus correspond to the biological activity
      of a substance presenting an active principle modified, optimized,
      amplified, purified or without secondary effects.<br>
      <br>
      One thus can and particularly to influence (to increase, to be
      opposed, see removing) a determined biological activity.<br>
      <br>
      To optimize or modify such signals in order to obtain a different
      result of that obtained by the corresponding signal with the
      initial active principle, one will proceed for example by testing
      the active principle modified thanks to the implementation of
      different tentative protocols known or easy to work out for the
      person skilled in the art and whom it has at his disposal to
      account for the activity of a determined or improved active
      principle.<br>
      <br>
      Advantageously the transmitted signal corresponds to that
      transmitted by several present substances in the first material
      and it is treated by known methods of treatment digital or
      analogue into they-same, to analyze and measure of the aforesaid
      substances among the others, such as for example the blood rate of
      glucose or alcohol.<br>
      <br>
      In an advantageous embodiment, the determined substance is present
      in homeopathic amount in the carrying first material.<br>
      <br>
      The homeopathic amount used is then advantageously optimized in
      order to allow a manifestation maximum of the desired biological
      effect, and this in a known way in it same, starting from numerous
      treaties written and published in the species, such as for example
      “the practical homeopathy” of Doctor C.BINET published with the
      editings of ANGLES (1979).<br>
      <br>
      In an advantageous embodiment the determined substance is present
      in homeopathic amount in the carrying first material, with great
      dilutions in extreme cases indicated by the number of Avogadro.<br>
      <br>
      In an advantageous mode of performing, dilution is a dilution
      about - log41M (theoretical).<br>
      <br>
      Advantageously the second material is consisted homeopathic
      granules.<br>
      <br>
      The homeopathic granules are often containing impregnated lactose
      of water molecules.<br>
      <br>
      The invention also relates to a material in a volume finite and
      carrying information characteristic of the specific biological
      behavior to a determined substance, but in the total absence of
      this determined substance in the aforementioned material, this
      information being with electrical or electromagnetic character
      because of its capacitance to being transmissible by electric
      means or electromagnetic, this manifestation being normally
      révélable by the action exerted by this material in finite volume
      with regard to a specific substrate with determined substance in a
      tentative protocol identical or similar with that which one would
      implement to account for the presence of the aforesaid determined
      substance in a medium which would contain it.<br>
      <br>
      A method particularly advantageous for the producing of such a
      carrier material is a method comprising the setting in electrical
      or electromagnetic relation of the same material, however not
      initially carrying the aforesaid information and free of any
      physical presence of the aforesaid determined substance, with a
      medium containing this last, via electromagnetic or electrical
      signal transmission means comprising an apparatus provided with
      receiver means, average amplifiers with high profit.<br>
      <br>
      The invention also proposes an apparatus implementing the method
      in accordance with the invention, comprising average electrical or
      electromagnetic signal sensors transmitted by a first material and
      characteristics of a specific manifestation of a biological
      activity of a determined substance contained in this first
      material, of the average amplifiers with high profit of the
      aforesaid signals and of the emitter means suitable also to
      transmit signals characteristics of the biological activity to a
      second material otherwise deprived of any contact with the first.<br>
      <br>
      In modes particular of performing, one has moreover recourse to
      the one and/or the other of the following provisions - the average
      amplifiers comprise an electronic circuitry of amplifying to high
      profit, in the form of discrete elements or of the semiconductor
      type; - the electronic circuitry of amplifying
      includes/understands a mounted output transistor out of
      common-emitter; - the sensor and the transmitter comprise
      electromagnetic coils - the supply of the apparatus is done by
      battery, which makes it possible to avoid the possible
      perturbations of the sector.<br>
      <br>
      But a supply starting from the alternating array 220 Volts
      converted in low continuous tension, for example 9 Volts, is also
      completely operable; - the apparatus includes/understands moreover
      of average the electromagnetic storage medium of the transmitted
      signals, of same known type in them, such as for example a
      magnetic tape; ; - the apparatus comprises moreover of the average
      converters analogue/digital of the transmitted signals and storage
      means on a datum storage medium digital of the aforesaid signals,
      such as for example an optical disc, a computerized memory etc T -
      the apparatus includes/understands processing means digital or
      analogue transmitted signal, to modify the said signal to make it
      correspond to that of a substance presenting an active principle
      modified, optimized, amplified, purified or without secondary
      effects - the apparatus includes/understands processing means
      digital or analogue arranged to analyze and measure the
      transmitted signals corresponding one with a substance among
      others, such as for example the rate of glucose in the alcohol
      blood or rate - the second coil is arranged to emit towards a
      living material, such as a nonhuman body.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention will be included/understood better with the
      reading of the description which follows of an embodiment given as
      nonrestrictive example, and within sight of the examples and
      results supplied hereafter in a nonrestrictive way.<br>
      <br>
      Description also refers to the drawings which accompany it, in
      which - <br>

      <br>
      Figure 1 watch an apparatus 1 of transmission of the specific
      biological activity to a determined substance, for example of
      histamine or ovalbumin, a carrying first material 2, for example
      consisted distilled water placed in an ampoule preferably out of
      glass 3 from 1 to 10 ml, with a second material 4 also consisted
      water distilled and placed in an ampoule from 1 to 10 ml or a
      container 5 for example of 500 ml, even more, also and preferably
      out of glass.<br>
      <br>
      Material 2 can comprise in its breast the physical presence of
      determined substance, in or not homeopathic quantity, or can
      simply comprise information characteristics of the activity or the
      specific biological behavior with determined substance.<br>
      <br>
      The physical presence can for example be revealed by a method of
      the type spectrometry or spectrofluorometry.<br>
      <br>
      Information characteristics of a manifestation itself
      characteristic of the specific biological behavior to a determined
      substance can, when with it, being normally révélable at the time
      of the action which it can exert on a medium containing this
      determined substance with regard to a target (organism or
      reagents) implemented in a tentative protocol adapted to account
      for the presence in this medium of the aforesaid determined
      substance.<br>
      <br>
      Material 4 is initially free in its breast of any physical
      presence of the aforesaid determined substance, and is not
      initially carrying information characteristics of the specific
      biological behavior with determined substance.<br>
      <br>
      Apparatus 1 includes/understands an electromagnetic sensor 5
      comprising an housing 6, provided with a tray 7 on which ampoule 3
      is deposited.<br>
      <br>
      In the embodiment particularly described here, the tray is for
      example made up out of transparent plastic with the
      electromagnetic waves, of low thickness (for example 2
      millimeters).<br>
      <br>
      Inside housing 6 the electromagnetic sensor itself, for example
      consisted a receiver coil 8 is as one will see it in reference on
      figure 2.<br>
      <br>
      Sensor 5 is connected, by electrical conducting cable, with a
      circuit 9 amplifier with high profit placed in an housing 10.<br>
      <br>
      Circuit output 9 is connected, also by electrical conducting
      cable, with a sensor transmitter 11, of configuration similar to
      sensor 5 but arranged for the transmission, and on the tray 12
      whose is placed the ampoule or container 5 of retention of second
      material 4.<br>
      <br>
      Circuit 9 includes/understands means 13 of setting of the power
      (potentiometer, dial, etc) and of powering 14 (switch) apparatus
      known in themselves.<br>
      <br>
      One represented accurately on figure 2 electronic circuitry 9 of
      apparatus 1 according to the embodiment of the invention
      particularly described here.<br>
      <br>
      Circuit 9 is connected on one side to electromagnetic coil 8 to
      high impedance (receiving) (for example a coil made up of
      approximately 600 yarn coils enamelled of 5/100) belonging with
      sensor 5, and other side with electromagnetic coil 15 with high
      impedance (transmitting) (for example a coil made up of 100 yarn
      coils enamelled of 20/100) belonging with sensor 11.<br>
      <br>
      Circuit 9 includes/understands a filter cuts high 16 (for example
      of 10khi) connected to coil 8 and one pre-amplifier 17 comprising
      an amplifier transistor 18.<br>
      <br>
      Pre-amplifier 17 is connected of outputted to the operational
      amplifier 19 which can be connected directly to transmitter coil
      15, or as represented on figure 2, via a mounted output transistor
      20 out of common-emitter to generate an output current of stronger
      intensity.<br>
      <br>
      Such a change makes it possible to treat the more important liquid
      volumes in the same time, the alternating tension of outputted
      being in addition and for example from 4 to 5 Volts peak with
      peak.<br>
      <br>
      If not the provision above guarantees to outputted equivalent
      signal with a tension from 3 or 4V and a current from at least 20
      my.<br>
      <br>
      In an advantageous variant the amplifier is with variable profit
      for example of &lt; lmV with &gt; 3/4 V and of &lt; 10
      microamperes with &gt; 20 my.<br>
      <br>
      The supply of the circuit is done advantageously exclusively by
      batteries (not represented), which makes it possible to avoid the
      uncontrolled changes of the structure of the signal due to
      unpredictable perturbations of supply network 50 Hz (sector).<br>
      <br>
      One now will make reference, with illustrative titre, two specific
      examples of transfer.<br>
      <br>
      In the first case (example N " L), it was about a transfer
      starting from water distilled, of the active principles of
      ovalbumin (Ova) or the endotoxine of E.Coli (Endo) towards one
      second distilled water material also made up, and in the second
      case (example N " 2) of a transfer always between two materials
      made up of distilled water, of the principles of the endotoxine of
      E.Coli (Endo) or of histamine (Hista).<br>
      <br>
      A summary table several experiments carried out by the inventors
      to date, who thus could validate the method and the apparatus of
      the invention, is also presented.<br>
      <br>
      Detection method of the biological activity used in the
      experiments carried out, of which those corresponding with the two
      ciaprès examples, is the following one.<br>
      <br>
      Male hearts of guinea-pigs of Hartley of approximately 400 G are
      mounted on an apparatus known under denomination ANDERSON for
      infusion of heart and perfusés at 37 " C with a buffer solution
      Krebs-Henseleit (KHB into initial Anglo-Saxon for Krebs-Henseleit
      Buffer) (lmN Ca2+) with a pH of about 7,4. The solution is
      ventilated permanently with a mixing O2/CO2 to 95,5%.<br>
      <br>
      The coronary flow is controlled permanently for example using an
      apparatus of known automatic weighing in itself, connected to
      computer means of processing and restitution of the measured
      flows, in graphic form.<br>
      <br>
      The maximum and minimum systolic contractions, the heart rate and
      the values of dp/dt (speed of the muscular contraction) measured
      and are recorded permanently via a transducer, for example a known
      transducer under reference ELI-SO45-35 of company ENRA
      Technologies: 53 bld of the General Martial Vallin - 75015 Stakes
      (France).<br>
      <br>
      The active principles (histamine, ovalbumin or endotoxine of
      E.Coli) which made the object of a transfer, were diluted starting
      from concentration of lmM with distilled water.<br>
      <br>
      Between each dilution, the solutions were violently agitated in a
      pendent vortex 15 S.<br>
      <br>
      The solutions are injected at the base of the aorta with an
      electrical syringe (6 ml 1 ml/mn).<br>
      <br>
      EXAMPLE NR " 1<br>
      <br>
      The transfer of ovalbumin (Ova), endotoxine of E.Coli (Endo) and,
      as control, of distilled water, out of sealed ampoules of 2 ml,
      was carried out towards water sealed ampoule-girls distilled of 2
      ml.<br>
      <br>
      The concentration in theory active was in the “transmitting”
      ampoules of 1 X 10-8 Moles per liter.<br>
      <br>
      The ampoule-girls were then diluted to the 1/1000 and 20 ml of
      dilutions were divided into tubes of 50 ml.<br>
      <br>
      The tubes were tested at blind (in the order, from 1 to 12) on
      July 11, 1992 out of two isolated hearts of pre guinea-pigs
      immunized with ovalbumin.<br>
      <br>
      The results are the following ones<br>

      bacterial contamination of the tube, giving one<br>
      reaction of type endotoxine.<br>
      <br>
      The effects of the 5 active tubes (water having received Ova
      information or Endo) and the absence of effect of 7 controls
      (water of origin or having received information water) are net and
      reproducible.<br>
      <br>
      One finds these differences on the mechanical effects (not shown
      here).<br>
      <br>
      This experiment in accordance with the invention illustrates the
      transmission of biological activities to water by an electronic
      circuitry or electromagnetic.<br>
      <br>
      EXAMPLE NR " 2:<br>
      <br>

      SUMMARY TABLE<br>
      The following table gives the effects on coronary flow in % of
      variation of the flow (in + or in -) on hearts of guinea-pigs
      previously immunized to ovalbumin (in the presence of Alum like
      adjuvant) at the end of October 1992.<br>
      <br>
      with<br>
      C1: not transmitted water<br>
      C2: transmitted water, i.e. which has received one<br>
      neutral information (background noise of the apparatus)<br>
      Hist: water with transmitted histamine, i.e. which has<br>
      received information “Histamine”<br>
      Ova: water with transmitted ovalbumin, i.e. which has<br>
      received information “Ovalbumin”<br>
      Endo: water with endotoxine transmitted, i.e. which has<br>
      received information “Endotoxine”.<br>
      <br>
      As one can note it coronary flows vary in a way significant and
      systematic at the time of the corresponding information transfer
      to histamine, ovalbumin or the endotoxine, whereas in the presence
      of water (transmitted or not), of low variations or substantially
      any variation are observed, which illustrates the present
      invention.<br>
      <br>
      The use of second material in which appears the transmitted
      activity can be done for example by oral route, injection, even
      same impregnation by contact between the skin of the individual to
      be treated and a container containing the aforementioned second
      material.<br>
      <br>
      As it goes without saying, and as it results besides from what
      precedes, the present invention is not limited to the embodiments
      of the invention particularly not described. It relates to on the
      contrary all the variants of them and particularly those where: -
      the carrier materials are not 1 'pure water, but of the aqueous
      mixtures, or materials pasty or solid, - the sensors are not of
      electromagnetic type but of the electrical type, i.e. they are
      arranged to detect a difference in potential. They can then be
      metallic plates connected between them via an amplifier to high
      profit, the first and second materials or their containers being
      particularly placed at contact with the sensors, - the active
      principles are different those particularly tested. All types of
      biological molecules capable to be contained in all natural
      substance types or artificial acting on the living beings, species
      animal or vegetal, are in fact concerned. They can be for example
      present substances in the blood or any other liquid body or
      biological tissue of the animals or in vitro men, ex vivo, in
      vivo.<br>
      <br>
      The revelation of the presence of information corresponding one to
      an active principle could then be done differently, in a known way
      in itself by a person skilled in the art for the active principle
      concerned. <br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Abstract</span> -- The invention
      relates to a method and system for providing a substance (101)
      with receptive and/or transmissive properties, which permit the
      substance (101) to receive or transmit a signal, acquired by
      receiving an electromagnetic field coming from a source substance.
      The substance (101) is subjected to an electromagnetic field
      and/or a sound (102), emitted at one or more given frequencies for
      a given period. The invention permits the substance (101),
      initially non-receptive and/or non-transmissive to be given
      receptive and/or transmissive properties.<br>

      Present invention relates to a method and a system allowing to
      ensure, that after an application of a generated signal starting
      from a field electromagnetic generated by a substance source, a
      substance, especially of water, present an active characteristic
      of the substance source.<br>
      <br>
      It is known, especially patent FR 2783606, which it is possible to
      produce a substance having an active characteristic of a substance
      source, while applying to substance, initially inactive, a
      generated signal to be left, and in function, electromagnetic
      field generated by the substance source.<br>
      <br>
      Such an active characteristic can be a chemical biological
      activity and/or or a biological and/or chemical behavior.<br>
      <br>
      It was observed that the application with substance of such a
      signal does not guarantee that the substance, subsequently to this
      application, will acquire the active characteristic of the
      substance source. Large changes as for the capacity of a substance
      to acquire an active characteristic of a substance source by
      application of a signal are observed.<br>
      <br>
      Especially, it happens that water subjected to a generated signal
      to leave, and in function, electromagnetic field generated by a
      substance active source present step of specific activity. The
      signal then seems not to have acted on water so as to make it
      active. Thus, the capacity of water to record, keep a trace of the
      signal to which it is subjected thus varies experiment in
      experiment from 0% to 100% same when it is a specific robot which
      carries them out handlings. That poses especially an obvious
      problem of reproducibility.<br>
      <br>
      The invention solves this problem of reproducibility.<br>
      <br>
      It consists in previously treating substance with the application
      of the signal. For that, the invention relates to a method to
      confer on a substance, especially of water, properties receptive
      and/or diffusing making it possible substance to be informed
      and/or to diffuse a signal, especially an acquired signal by
      collecting an electromagnetic field coming from a substance
      source, the aforementioned method comprising the step to subject,
      using a transmitter, substance with an electromagnetic field
      and/or an emitted sound at one or more included frequencies in a
      pendent frequency spectrum predetermined one predetermined
      duration.<br>
      <br>
      Indeed, in accordance with the invention, the substance, initially
      nonreceptive and/or nondiffusing, is made adapted to receive
      and/or diffuse a signal.<br>
      <br>
      According to other performings', the method comprises moreover a
      step of agitation of substance, the aforementioned step of
      successive or simultaneous agitation being with the step to
      subject substance to an electromagnetic field and/or an emitted
      sound.<br>
      <br>
      The agitation especially makes it possible to decrease the
      predetermined duration pendent which the substance is subjected to
      an electromagnetic field and/or an emitted sound. This agitation
      consists, for example, with the creation of a vortex in the
      solution.<br>
      <br>
      The invention also relates to a system to implement the method
      like presented above, a substance made receptive and/or diffusing
      according to a method of the invention and the use of such a
      substance for the producing of a substance presenting an active
      characteristic of a substance source.<br>
      <br>
      Other characteristics and advantages of the invention will appear
      with description made below, this last being carried out with
      descriptive and nonrestrictive titre by making reference with the
      drawings hereafter on which:<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Figure 1</span> represents a
      system in accordance with the invention.<br>
      <br>
      <div style="text-align: center;"><img src="us2004038a.jpg" alt="">
      </div>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Figure 2</span> is a diagram
      illustrating the presence or not active characteristic in
      substances obtained or not in accordance with the invention.<br>
      <br>
      <div style="text-align: center;"><img src="us2004038c.jpg" alt="">
      </div>
      <br>
      According to figure 1, a system in accordance with the invention
      comprises a transmitter 102 to subject substance 101 to an
      electromagnetic field and/or an emitted sound 104 at one or more
      included frequencies in a pendent frequency spectrum predetermined
      one predetermined duration.<br>
      <br>
      The transmitter is for example an high speaker making it possible
      to subject substance to an applied frequency in sound form.<br>
      <br>
      It is also possible that the transmitter is a transmitter of
      electromagnetic waves, for example an electromagnetic coil,
      subjecting, for example, the substance with a field of frequency
      50 Hz, 500 Hz or others: white noise…<br>
      <br>
      The frequencies are selected in a frequency spectrum predetermined
      by an electromagnetic generator 103 of field and/or sound 104.<br>
      <br>
      It is possible to use one or of the given frequencies for the
      electromagnetic field and/or sound 104.<br>
      <br>
      The subjecting of substance, of water in the experiment, at random
      frequencies covering at least the spectrum of the audible
      frequencies (20 Hz - 20000 Hz) made it possible to obtain a
      formatted said water, namely a water having a good receptivity
      and/or good diffusing qualities at a signal coming from a
      substance active source.<br>
      <br>
      The random frequencies can especially be obtained by the diffusion
      of a music piece.<br>
      <br>
      Examples of predetermined duration are given below. Generator 103
      allows a control of the predetermined duration. For example, the
      water subjected to a music 104 pendent one present night a
      receptivity and/or good diffusing qualities.<br>
      <br>
      According to another performing of the invention, the system
      comprises moreover means to agitate substance, for example of
      swirling manner.<br>
      <br>
      The creation of an agitation in substance especially makes it
      possible to reduce the predetermined duration to which water must
      be subjected to be formatted. For example, a correct formatting of
      water and thus a good receptivity and/or good diffusing qualities
      are observed when water is subjected to a music 104 pendent two
      hours and successively agitated of swirling manner, for example
      pendent twenty seconds. It is also possible to simultaneously
      agitate water with the diffusion of the music piece.<br>
      <br>
      A container 100 contains substance 101. This container is for
      example a cylinder in transparent plastic.<br>
      <br>
      Any other form (tube…) allowing to accomodate substance is
      appropriate thus that any other material (glass, metal…) permeable
      with the sound and/or the electromagnetic waves can be used.<br>
      <br>
      Advantageously, the container is placed on transmitter 102 but any
      other position making it possible substance to receive the
      electromagnetic waves and/or sound 104 is possible.<br>
      <br>
      In another performing, the transmitter can be placed within
      substance, for example, immersed in water.<br>
      <br>
      Figure 2 in accordance with the invention illustrates the action
      of a method on the capacity of water to being informed by a
      generated signal starting from an electromagnetic field generated
      by a substance source possessing an active characteristic.<br>
      <br>
      The hirudine is an acting anticoagulant by direct inhibition of
      thrombin. At the site of action, the effect of the hirudine is
      immediate. In the given illustration, the substance source is the
      hirudine and the generated signal from electromagnetic field of
      the substance source is called signal hirudine.<br>
      <br>
      A said method of information making it possible to obtain an
      informed substance, i.e. presenting the properties of an
      anticoagulant such as the east the hirudine, is described in the
      patent FR 2783606.<br>
      <br>
      According to this method, the electromagnetic field coming from
      the hirudine, substance source, is transformed into an electrical
      signal using a transducer-receptor collecting the electromagnetic
      field. The electrical signal is then applied with a substance by
      means of a transducer-transmitter.<br>
      <br>
      The substance to which the electrical signal is applied can or not
      be subjected to the method in accordance with the invention.<br>
      <br>
      The experiment consists in in accordance with the invention
      comparing substances having undergone a method and others which
      did not undergo it, previously with the application of the method
      of information.<br>
      <br>
      Like biological system allowing to reveal an anticoagulant effect
      of the hirudine or signal hirudine, one uses a solution of water,
      substance capable to undergo a method in accordance with the
      invention, including thrombin. One mixture the solution
      water-thrombin with a fibrinogen solution which, under the effect
      of thrombin, ends in the formation of a fibrin clot, final step of
      coagulation.<br>
      <br>
      In order to measure coagulation, one measuring change according to
      the time of the optical density of the solution resulting of the
      mixture. Present figure 2 thus of the curves of optical density
      (in ordinate).<br>
      <br>
      Curve 201 represents the evolution of the optical density observed
      after the adding of a solution of water including of molecular
      thrombin in the absence of hirudine in a solution including of
      fibrinogen. The solution of water including of thrombin is carried
      out with a water which did not undergo any prior preparation (and
      thus not formatted according to the vocabulary defined above). It
      is checked that the optical density increases rapidly: there is
      coagulation.<br>
      <br>
      On figure 2, is represented curve 202 corresponding one with the
      mixture of a solution of water including of the thrombin into
      which molecular hirudine was introduced with a solution including
      of fibrinogen. One observes only one low increase of the optical
      density in time: it is checked that there is no coagulation.<br>
      <br>
      Then, for the requirements of the comparing, several solutions
      including of thrombin are prepared with water not having undergone
      a method of formatting in accordance with the invention and having
      undergone a method of information using the signal hirudine like
      described above.<br>
      <br>
      It is observed that the curves of optical density obtained after
      mixture with a solution including of fibrinogen are sparingly
      reproducible. Thus it is possible to observe curves near of curve
      201, intermediate curve 202 or curves. For example curve 203 is
      representative of a not formatted solution of water, not including
      a molecular hirudine but to which a signal hirudine was applied.<br>
      <br>
      The anticoagulant effect of the signal hirudine is not observed.<br>
      <br>
      Also, for the requirements of the comparing, several solutions
      including of thrombin are prepared with water having undergone a
      method of formatting in accordance with the invention and having
      undergone a method of information using the signal hirudine like
      described above.<br>
      <br>
      Curve 204 represents the results obtained with such solutions of
      water including of molecular thrombin without hirudine but to
      which a signal hirudine was applied.<br>
      <br>
      Such a curve is obtained in a reproducible way.<br>
      <br>
      Lastly, a similar curve with curve 201 is obtained with solutions
      of water including of thrombin prepared with water having
      undergone a method of formatting in accordance with the invention
      and not having undergone a method of information using the signal
      hirudine.<br>
      <br>
      Measuring repeated on water samples having undergone a method of
      formatting in accordance with the invention and on water samples
      not having undergone a formatting before the application of a
      signal of type hirudine shows an average anticoagulant activity
      much higher for the sample formatted according to the method of
      the invention. The table below watch measurement results of the
      activity anti coagulating after application of a signal of type
      hirudine with formatted water samples and not formatted water
      samples. The reported results correspond to the percentage of
      inhibition of thrombin at the end of thirty minutes. For
      comparing, measurement results of the coagulating anti activity of
      a solution of hirudine titrated with a M/L are presented. One thus
      observes an average value raised for the hirudine (70. 6%), as
      well as differential substantial enter the average observed for
      the water samples formatted in accordance with the invention (21.
      4%) and that observed for the not formatted water samples (9.6%).<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Abstract</span> -- The invention
      concerns a method, a system and a device for producing, from a
      substance, electric signals characteristic of the biological
      activity of an active element contained in the substance. The
      method consists in: placing the substance in a zone subjected to a
      specific electric, magnetic and/or electromagnetic excitation
      field. The method further includes a step which consists in
      transforming the fields resulting form the interaction between the
      specific excitation filed and the substance, into signals, in
      particular electric signals, using a first transducer receiving
      the resulting fields.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Description</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0002] The present invention relates to a method, a system and a
      device for producing signals from a substance, in particular
      electric signals, characteristic of the biological and/or chemical
      activity or the biological and/or chemical behaviour of said
      substance or an active element contained in said substance. The
      invention also relates to a method and a system for controlling
      said signals. The invention also relates to the applications of
      said method, system and device in particular to the production of
      active substances and to the detection of defined substances.
      Finally, the invention relates to signals linked to a biological
      and/or chemical activity thus produced by said method, system and
      device.<br>
      <br>
      [0003] It is known from the research works of Jacques Benveniste,
      in particular those described in the patent application WO
      94/17406 published on Aug. 4, 1994, that one can pick up, from a
      biological and/or chemical active element such as a chemical
      compound, a cell or a micro-organism, or from a substance
      containing this active element such as a purified preparation, a
      biological sample, or a living being, an "electromagnetic signal
      characteristic of the biological and/or chemical activity or of
      the biological and/or chemical behaviour" of said substance and/or
      said active element contained in said substance.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] It is also known that it is possible to transform, in
      particular by means of a transducer, such an electromagnetic
      signal into electric signals. In the following text one also means
      by "electric signals characteristic of the biological and/or
      chemical activity or of the biological and/or chemical behaviour
      of said substance or of an active element contained in said
      substance" the electric signals derived by signal digitising
      and/or processing. In this expression the word "characteristic" is
      used in the meaning where the physical parameters of the electric
      signals are specific to the substance or to the active element
      contained in said substance and that the application of these
      electric signals, via a transducer, to a biological control system
      makes it possible:<br>
      <br>
      [0005] (i) to induce a biological and/or chemical activity on said
      biological control system relative to that of the substance of
      origin or the active element it contains;<br>
      <br>
      [0006] (ii) to reveal a characteristic of the substance or the
      active element it contains, at the origin of said electric
      signals.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] The patent application WO 94/17406 published on Aug. 4,
      1994, describes a method and a device for picking up "an
      electromagnetic signal characteristic of a biological and/or
      chemical activity or of a biological and/or chemical behaviour"
      from a biological and/or chemical active element such as a
      chemical compound, a cell or micro-organism, o r from a substance
      containing this active element such as a purified preparation, a
      biological sample, or a living being.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] Since then the inventors have discovered that it is
      possible to improve the quality of the electromagnetic signal
      picked up as well as the reliability of the method for producing
      these signals and that consequently it is possible to produce
      characteristic electric signals appropriate for industrial
      applications. The production of such characteristic electric
      signals implies an exceptional industrial importance.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] It thus becomes possible to detect and characterise active
      elements present in low concentration or in very low concentration
      in a substance. As examples, it is thus possible to monitor the
      presence or absence of chemical compounds such as caffeine,
      ionophoretic-calcium, ovalbumin, propranolol or micro-organisms
      such as bacterium coli, streptococci, staphilocci whose presence
      is looked for.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] It thus becomes possible to carry out remote tests at
      several thousands of kilometers since the characteristic signals
      are electric signals which can immediately be transmitted to the
      investigation centre of the control laboratory.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] It is possible to modify the biological and/or chemical
      activity or the biological and/or chemical behaviour of a
      biological receptor system by submitting it to the effects of
      characteristic electric signals. It also becomes possible to
      produce new drugs such as solutions depending on signals from
      arnica, bradykinin, caffeine, nicotine. New production techniques
      for drugs can be implemented. For example, in the case of certain
      drugs such as antibiotics, anti-viruses, anti-parasites,
      anti-mitotics which, to act within bacteria, viruses or cells
      (tumour cells in particular), must breach the defensive barriers
      of the above, the signals of these drugs are applied directly into
      the heart of the bacteria, viruses or cells. In fact, the
      application of characteristic electric signals, via a n
      appropriate transducer, generates magnetic fields which penetrate
      into the bacteria, viruses or cells and modify their chemical
      and/or biological behaviour.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] It is possible to store the characteristic electric signals
      in data banks, using computer techniques. Then, the spread of
      therapeutic resources, from one point to the other on the planet,
      is instantaneous according to needs.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] The examples described above concern the medical domain.
      The chemical industry also, such as electronic components, will
      also be concerned by the new possibilities offered by the present
      invention. The use of electromagnetic fields, emitted by
      characteristic electric signals, to modify the behaviour of
      molecules and promote chemical reactions will open up new
      prospects concerning both the conception of new materials and
      their methods of production. Thus, for example, it will be
      possible to use them as catalysts able to influence the
      stereochemistry of molecules.<br>
      <br>
      [0014] The method according to the invention making it possible to
      improve the performances of characteristic electric signals
      comprises the stages:<br>
      <br>
      [0015] of placing said substance in a zone submitted to a specific
      excitation field of electric, magnetic and/or electromagnetic
      nature,<br>
      <br>
      [0016] of transforming the fields resulting from the interaction
      of the specific excitation field and the substance, into signals,
      in particular electric signals, by means of a first transducer
      receiving said resulting fields.<br>
      <br>
      [0017] In fact, the inventors have noted that, in a surprising
      manner, the use of an excitation field such as for example an
      electromagnetic field of uniform power spectral density over a
      frequency spread (for example white noise of 1 Hz to 20 kHz) makes
      it possible to improve the performance of characteristic electric
      signals. As an example of such a first transducer, one can mention
      very sensitive small copper wire bobbins with an impedance of 300
      Ohms; internal diameter of 6 mm, external diameter of 16 mm,
      length 6 mm, normally used as telephone receivers.<br>
      <br>
      [0018] Preferably, the process according to the invention further
      comprises the stage for processing said signals derived from said
      first transducer, relative to second signals derived from a second
      transducer receiving the specific excitation field, in the absence
      of said substance. As an example, the processing can consist of
      subtracting these two signals by using two receiver bobbins
      connected in series and with opposite phases, one facing said
      substance and receiving the electromagnetic field through said
      substance and the other receiving the electromagnetic field
      directly. Thus, the part of the signals really characteristic of
      the biological and/or chemical activity or of the biological
      and/or chemical behaviour of said substance or said active element
      contained in said substance, is enhanced relative to that derived
      from the first transducer alone.<br>
      <br>
      [0019] As an example, according to another embodiment of the
      invention, the processing can consist of recording consecutively
      the signals coming from said substance and then the signals coming
      from a neutral substance (water or physiological serum), then
      subtracting the first signals from the second (which serve as
      reference), this subtraction being carried out before or after
      processing the signals as described below (subtraction of
      amplitudes or power spectral densities).<br>
      <br>
      [0020] Preferably, according to another embodiment of the
      invention, the process according to the invention comprises the
      stage of processing the signals derived from said first
      transducer, in function of the characteristics of the specific
      excitation field. For example, the signal processing consists of
      calculating the power spectral density using a Fourier transform,
      to narrow the useful frequency band (bandpass filter), to
      normalise the specific excitation field relative to the power
      spectral density, and to reconstitute a signal using an inverse
      Fourier transform. As in the case of the preceding embodiment, the
      part of the signals which are really characteristic of the
      biological and/or chemical activity or of the biological and/or
      chemical behaviour of said substance or said active element
      contained in said substance, are thus enhanced relative to that
      produced without processing.<br>
      <br>
      [0021] Preferably, the specific excitation field has the
      characteristic of having a uniform power spectral density over a
      frequency band. As an example, the power spectral density is
      uniform over a frequency band from 1 Hz to 20 kHz. Thus, said
      substance is submitted to a neutral excitation field of the white
      noise type.<br>
      <br>
      [0022] Preferably, furthermore, the zone submitted to the specific
      excitation field is insulated from parasitic fields from the
      environment.<br>
      <br>
      [0023] The invention also relates to the applications of the
      signals produced. To this effect, the method further comprises the
      stage of applying said signals from said first transducer to a
      biological receiver, by means of a third transducer. In the case
      where said signals are processed, it is the signals processed in
      this way which are applied to the biological system receptor.<br>
      <br>
      [0024] As an example, said third transducer will generate and emit
      an electromagnetic field in the direction of biological system
      receptors such as a carrier substance or a reactive medium
      producing stereochemical molecules. This electromagnetic field
      will modify the biological and/or chemical activity or the
      biological and/or chemical behaviour of the biological system
      receiver as a function of the nature of biological and/or chemical
      activity or the biological and/or chemical behaviour of said
      substance. Thus, for example, it is possible to send the message
      for caffeine into a water-based beverage to produce a dietetic
      drink or an alimentary supplement.<br>
      <br>
      [0025] The invention also concerns the control of characteristic
      electric signals. For this, the process further comprises the
      stage for controlling the correlation between on the one hand, the
      signal derived from said first transducer or the processed signal
      and, on the other hand, the biological and/or chemical activity or
      the biological and/or chemical behaviour of said substance or said
      active element contained in said substance. This control is
      carried out by applying, by means of said third transducer, the
      signals derived from said first transducer to a biological control
      system and by verifying that said biological control system reacts
      in a specific manner to the signals from said first transducer. In
      the case where said signals are processed, it is the signals thus
      processed which are applied to said biological control system. The
      reaction of said biological control system must be related to the
      nature of the biological and/or chemical activity or the
      biological and/or chemical behaviour of said substance or said
      active element contained in said substance whose signals are
      emitted from said first transducer. As an example, in particular
      one can cite as a biological control system: an isolated
      guinea-pig heart, a ligand/receptor couple in particular an
      antigen/antibody couple, the skin of a guinea-pig or a live rabbit
      which is submitted to a cutaneous injection test, isolated or
      cultured cells.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] Surprisingly, it was noted that the method according to the
      invention for producing characteristic signals delivers
      exploitable signals from an active substance whose active element
      can even be contained in low or very low concentrations (less the
      10&lt;6 &gt;moles per liter). The method according to the
      invention can thus be applied to characterise the presence of an
      active element at the trace level in a substance.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] The invention also relates to a system for producing
      signals, in particular electric signals, characteristic of the
      biological and/or chemical activity or of the biological and/or
      chemical behaviour of a substance or an active element contained
      in said substance. The invention also concerns a system for
      implementing the properties of said signals. Said system comprises
      an emitter generating a specific excitation field of electric,
      magnetic and/or electromagnetic nature in a zone where said
      substance is located. As an example, one can cite an emitter with
      the following characteristics: bobbin with internal diameter 50
      mm, length 80 mm, R=3.6 ohms, 3 layers of 112 turns of copper
      wire, field on the axis to the centre 44 Oe/A, and on the edge 25
      Oe/A. Said system also comprises a first transducer receiving the
      fields resulting from the interaction of said specific excitation
      field and said substance, said first transducer transforming said
      resulting fields into signals, in particular electric signals. As
      an example, one can cite a transducer such as a very sensitive
      little bobbin of copper wire with an impedance of 300 Ohms, of
      internal diameter 6 mm external diameter 16 mm, length 6 mm,
      usually used for telephone receivers. In the case of this example
      the characteristics of the electric signals derived from the
      transducer are as follows: amplitude of about 200 mV crest to
      crest.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] Said system also comprises means of emission for applying
      said signals derived from said first transducer to a biological
      system receptor. As an example of such means of emission, one can
      cite a transducer with the following characteristics: bobbin with
      internal diameter 50 mm, length 80 mm, R=3.6 ohms, 3 layers of 112
      spirals of copper wire, field on the axis to the centre 44 Oe/A,
      and on the edge 25 Oe/A. Examples of biological receptor systems
      have been mentioned above.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] Preferably, the system according to the invention further
      comprises means for processing said signals derived from said
      first transducer, in function of the signals derived from a second
      transducer receiving the specific excitation field, in the absence
      of said substance. Thus said processed signals are more
      characteristic of the biological and/or chemical activity or the
      biological and/or chemical behaviour of said substance or said
      active element contained in said substance.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] Preferably, according to another variant of the invention,
      the system further comprises means for processing the signals
      derived from said first transducer, in function of the
      characteristics of the specific excitation field. In the case of
      this variant embodiment also, said processed signals are more
      characteristic of the biological and/or chemical activity or of
      the biological and/or chemical behaviour of said substance or said
      active element contained in said substance.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] Preferably, said specific excitation field has the
      characteristic of having a uniform power spectral density over a
      frequency band.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] Preferably, the system according to the invention further
      comprises means for isolating said zone from parasitic fields from
      the environment.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] Preferably, the system according to the invention further
      comprises control means for controlling the correlation between,
      on the one hand, the signal derived from said first transducer or
      the processed signal and, on the other hand, the biological and/or
      chemical activity or of the biological and/or chemical behaviour
      of said substance or said active element contained in said
      substance. Said control means comprise a third transducer applying
      the signals derived from said first transducer to a biological
      control system. In the case where the signals are processed, it is
      the processed signals which are applied to the biological control
      system. Said control means further comprise means for verifying
      that the biological control system reacts in a specific manner to
      the signals derived from said first transducer, according to the
      nature of the biological and/or chemical activity or of the
      biological and/or chemical behaviour of said substance or said
      active element contained in said substance from which the signals
      derived from said first transducer are issued. As an example, one
      can cite as biological control system: an isolated guinea-pig
      heart, a ligand/receptor couple in particular an antigen/antibody
      couple, an injectable substance provoking cutaneous reactions,
      isolated or cultured cells.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] Preferably, the system according to the invention is such
      that said substance contains a low concentration or very weak
      concentration of an active element.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] The invention also relates to a device for producing
      signals, in particular electric signals, characteristic of the
      biological and/or chemical activity or of the biological and/or
      chemical behaviour of a substance or an active element contained
      in said substance. Said device comprises an emitter generating a
      specific excitation field of electric, magnetic and/or
      electromagnetic nature in a zone where said substance is located.
      It also comprises a first transducer receiving the fields
      resulting from the interaction of said specific excitation field
      and said substance. Said first transducer transforms said
      resulting fields into signals, in particular electric signals.
      Said signals are characteristic of the biological and/or chemical
      activity or of the biological and/or chemical behaviour of said
      substance or said active element contained in said substance.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] The device according to the invention further comprises
      means for processing said signals derived from said first
      transducer, relative to the signals derived from a second
      transducer receiving the specific excitation field, in the absence
      of said substance.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] According to another embodiment variant of the invention
      the device further comprises means for processing the signals
      derived from said first transducer, in function of the
      characteristics of the specific excitation field.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] Preferably, said specific excitation field has the
      characteristic of a uniform power spectral density over a
      frequency band.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] Preferably, the device according to the invention further
      comprises means for isolating said zone from parasitic fields from
      the environment.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] The invention also relates to the applications of the
      method, system or the device described above. More particularly,
      the invention concerns the production of active substances in
      particular the production of drugs. Said active substances are
      produced by applying said signals derived from said first
      transducer to a carrier substance. In the case where said signals
      are processed, it is the signals thus processed which are applied
      to the carrier substance.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] The invention also relates to the application of the
      process, system or device which has the aim of establishing a
      table of correlation between the characteristics of a determined
      substance or an active element contained in said determined
      substance and the modifications they can induce on test biological
      systems. Such correlation tables also enter into the framework of
      the invention, as well as the use of such correlation tables for
      detecting said determined substance or said active element
      contained in said determined substance. This detection can in
      particular be carried out remotely, after transmitting said
      characteristic signal to a testing laboratory possessing test
      biological systems. The correlation tables can also be used for
      controlling the production of homeopathic products, by making it
      possible to verify the activity of the latter during successive
      phases of dilution.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] The invention also relates to electric signals linked to a
      biological and/or chemical activity, obtained through implementing
      the method, the system or the device according to the invention.
      It is possible to characterise these signals from the effects they
      produce on a biological control system like that described above.<br>
      <br>

      embodiments of the invention, given as indicative but non-limiting
      examples, and also by reading the examples of experiments making

      <br>
      [0055] Below is described an example of an embodiment of a system
      and of a device for producing characteristic electric signals,
      with reference to FIGS. 1, 1a, 1b and 1c. In these figures, a
      schematic drawing is given of a variant of an embodiment of a
      system making it possible to produce characteristic electric
      signals and to implement them for industrial purposes. The signals
      are characteristic, in the meaning of the present invention, of
      the biological and/or chemical activity or of the biological
      and/or chemical behaviour of a substance.<br>
      <br>
      [0056] The system comprises a device 10 for producing electric
      signals characteristic of the biological and/or chemical activity
      or of the biological and/or chemical behaviour of a substance 1 or
      of an active element contained in said substance. In the case of
      the variant described with reference to FIGS. 1, 1a, 1b, 1c, said
      substance 1 is a solution of caffeine 10&lt;-6 &gt;M.<br>
      <br>
      [0057] The device 10, located in Paris, for example, produces
      characteristic electric signals which are digitised after
      digital-analog conversion. The signals thus digitised are, in a
      known manner, transmitted remotely, for example by a computer
      communication network of the Internet type using radio links 11.
      The digitised signals thus transmitted are received by an
      applicator 12, located in New York for example, comprising 10
      emission means 13. The emission means 13 make it possible to apply
      the characteristic signals (after digital-analog conversion) to a
      biological system receptor. In the case of the embodiment
      described with reference toFIG. 1, 1a, 1b and 1c, the biological
      system receptor is a dietetic beverage. The digitised signals can
      be processed 27, recorded and stored 33, before their remote
      transmission and/or before having been applied to a biological
      system receiver.<br>
      <br>
      [0058] The device for producing the signals 10 comprises a chamber
      2 provided with electric and magnetic shielding isolating it from
      parasitic fields from the environment. The shielded cylindrical
      chamber is composed of three superposed layers: copper, soft iron,
      permalloy, made from sheets 1 mm thick. The chamber has an
      internal diameter of 65 mm, and a height of 100 mm. The chamber is
      closed by a shielded lid 5. An emitter 4 is situated inside the
      chamber. It generates a specific excitation field of
      electromagnetic nature. The emitter is supplied by a generator,
      14. In the chamber 2 is placed a glass container 3 with the
      dimensions 10 mm*10 mm*4.5 mm. This container 3 holds 1 ml of the
      substance 1. The emitter 4 comprises a bobbin advantageously
      completed by a magnetic core in soft iron. The emitter bobbin 4
      has an impedance of 300 ohms, an internal diameter of 6 mm, an
      external diameter of 16 mm, and a length of 6 mm. The magnetic
      core in soft iron is placed in contact with the external walls of
      the container 3. Said substance is thus submitted to an excitation
      field emitted by the emitter 4. The generator 14 is designed to
      generate a low frequency signal especially square or sinusoidal
      low frequency signals, of pink noise or, advantageously, white
      noise. The spectrum of the excitation signal supplying the emitter
      bobbin 4 corresponds closely to the spectrum of audible
      frequencies (20 Hz-20,000 Hz). The generator 14 can be a generator
      of an analog signal of known type, using for example a read-only
      memory (ROM, PROM, EPROM, EEPROM) containing the digital signal of
      the desired noise. This memory is linked in a known way to a
      digital-analog converter. A microcomputer 14 can also b e used,
      provided with a sound card 25 comprising a digital-analog
      converter 41. For example, one can use a computer 14 of the PC
      type, operating under the WINDOWS(R) 95 operating system from
      MICROSOFT and comprising, apart from the sound card 25 a
      microprocessor 27, an input/output interface 29, a controller 31
      for mass storage 33 and a video interface 35 linked by one or
      several bus 37. The digital-analog converter 41 of the sound card
      25 comprises an output terminal 8. The output terminal 8 of the
      sound card of the microcomputer 14 is linked to the input terminal
      8' of the emitter 4, via an amplifier 15 whose specifications are
      the following: passband from 10 Hz to 20 kHz, gain 1 to 10, input
      sensitivity +/-1 V. Among the sound cards 25 which can be used,
      one can cite, for example the Soundblaster 16 card sold by the
      CREATIVELABS Company.<br>
      <br>
      [0059] The transducer 6, situated inside the chamber 2, receives
      the fields resulting from the interaction between said specific
      excitation field and said substance 1. The transducer 6 transforms
      said resulting fields into electric signals. These electric
      signals arrive at the output terminals 9' of the transducer 6
      under the form of a variable difference of potential or of an
      electric current of variable intensity. The transducer 6 comprises
      a bobbin with a soft iron core. This bobbin has an impedance of
      300 ohms, an internal diameter of 6 mm, an external diameter of 16
      mm, and a length of 6 mm. The magnetic core in soft iron is placed
      in contact with the external walls of the container 3.<br>
      <br>
      [0060] Advantageously, the characteristic electric signals
      available at the output from the transducer 6 are amplified by a
      preamplifier 16. The amplifier-preamplifier 16 has the following
      specifications: passband from 10 Hz to 20 kHz, gain 50 to 100 for
      an input sensitivity of +/-100 mV or gain 500 to 2000 for an input
      sensitivity of +/-5 mV (to be used in the case of an "opposition
      series" connection of a second transducer). The characteristic
      electric signals can b e recorded 31, stored 33, transferred 11,
      29, remotely by implementing technologies of electronics,
      computers and telecommunications known to those skilled in the
      art.<br>
      <br>
      [0061] The recording of characteristic electric signals, or that
      of electric signals derived after amplification or processing, can
      be carried out in analog by a signal recorder, in particular o n
      magnetic tape, adapted to the frequencies of the characteristic
      electric signals at the output from the transducer 6. Since the
      passband used corresponds to the audio band, one can i n
      particular use a tape recorder. The output terminal 9' of the
      device for producing signals 10 is linked to the microphone input
      or to the line input of such a tape recorder. During play, the
      characteristic electric signals recorded are collected at an
      output terminal, in particular at the line output or at the
      loudspeaker output of the tape recorder. Preferably, digital
      recording of the characteristic electric signals is carried out
      after analog-digital conversion of said signals. In order to d o
      this, a micro-computer 17 is used, provided with a signal
      acquisition card 25. For example, one can use a PC 17 type
      computer, operating on the WINDOWS(R) 95 operating system from
      MICROSOFT. This microcomputer can be of the same type as that used
      to generate the excitation field. It can be the same
      microcomputer. In this case it comprises, apart from the sound
      card, an acquisition card 25, a microprocessor 27, an input/output
      interface 29, a controller 31, a mass storage 33 and a video
      interface 35 linked by one or several bus 37. The acquisition card
      25 comprises a analog-digital converter 39 possessing, preferably,
      a resolution higher than 12 bits, and advantageously equal to 16
      bits, as well as a sampling frequency double the maximum frequency
      one wishes to be able to digitise, for example 44 kHz. The output
      9' of the transducer 6 is linked to the input 9 of the
      digital-analog converter 39 via the preamplifier 16.<br>
      <br>
      [0062] All links consist of shielded cable. All the apparatus is
      earthed.<br>
      <br>
      [0063] Advantageously, in order to process the characteristic
      electric signals or the signal derivatives, one uses the Matlab
      software from the company "The MathWorks". The output of the
      device 10 for producing characteristic electric signals is
      connected to the input 9 of the analog-digital converter 39 of the
      card 25 of the computer 17. One proceeds with a n acquisition of
      characteristic electric signals for a length of time for example
      of between 1 and 60 sec (for example 6 sec) and the digital file
      is saved in a mass storage 33, for example under the form of a
      sound file with the WAV format. This file can later undergo
      digital processing, as for example digital amplification for
      calibrating the signal level, filtering for eliminating unwanted
      frequencies, or be transformed into its spectrum by a discrete
      FOURIER transform, preferable by the algorithm of FFT "Fast
      Fourier Transform".<br>
      <br>
      [0064] The time length of the signal produced can be increased by
      repeating several times in a file a fragment or the totality of
      the sound file originally produced.<br>
      <br>
      [0065] These processing means of characteristic electric signals
      can be used to improve performances of said characteristic
      electric signals. In the case of a first embodiment variant, a
      second transducer of the first type described above is envisaged.
      This second transducer transforms the excitation field into
      electric signals, in the absence of said substance. These electric
      signals are subtracted by an opposition series connection to the
      signals derived from the first transducer. Thus one obtains
      signals more representative of the interaction between the
      specific excitation field and the substance. In the case of a
      second embodiment variant, the processing means take into account
      the characteristics of the specific excitation field and reprocess
      the characteristic electric signals in the following way. First of
      all one proceeds by calculating the spread of the PSD. Then this
      power spectral density is contracted by conserving only the
      frequency band ranging for example from 140 Hz to 14 kHz, and
      reconstituting a signal from this PSD and randomly generated
      phases, and finally calibrating the power of the signal thus
      produced.<br>
      <br>
      [0066] The characteristic electric signals available at the exit
      of the output from the device constituted by the combination of
      the emitter 4, the transducer 6 and if applicable the preamplifier
      16 already themselves constitute products suitable for industrial
      applications. They can be amplified, processed, saved, stored,
      transferred remotely by implementing state of the art technologies
      in electronics, computers and telecommunications. The industrial
      applications for which they can in particular be implemented have
      been noted.<br>
      <br>
      [0067] The file of characteristic electric signals, recorded under
      digital form as has just been described, possibly after
      processing, can be transferred remotely by a computer
      communication network. This network can comprise radio links 11.
      The file of characteristic electric signals thus transmitted is
      recorded by the mass storage of the microcomputer 18. For example,
      one can use a computer of the PC type, operating on a WINDOWS(R)
      95 operating system from MICROSOFT. This microcomputer 18 can be
      of the same type as that used for generating the excitation field.
      The file of characteristic signals thus transmitted and recorded
      can be exploited, in known ways, to produce analog characteristic
      electric signals. The possibly processed file is transformed by a
      digital-analog converter 41 of the card 25 (or a separate card) of
      the computer 18. The digital-analog converter 41 delivers analog
      electric signals to its output 8 characteristic of the biological
      activity of the substance from which they are issued. These
      signals can be transformed, as described below, into
      electromagnetic fields and applied to biological systems.<br>
      <br>
      [0068] Referring to FIG. 1c, a description is given of an
      embodiment of a system making it possible to apply characteristic
      electric signals to a biological system receiver and to modify its
      chemical behaviour. The flask 50 contains the biological system
      receiver. This is constituted, for example, of 10 ml distilled
      water for an injectable preparation (Biosédra or other brands) in
      a 15 ml tube in polypropylene (Falcon, Becton Dickinson 2097).
      This flask is set in an electromagnetic field radiated by a
      transducer 51, typically a bobbin. The bobbin, for example, has a
      length of 120 mm, an internal diameter of 25 mm, an external
      diameter of 28 mm, with 631 turns of wire of 0.5 mm diameter and a
      resistance of 4 ohms. The bobbin 51 is earthed. Without this
      representing any limiting character, the bobbin 51 of the
      transducer has a vertical axis making it possible to introduce the
      flask 50 containing the receptor biological system. The input
      terminals 8' of this bobbin 51 are linked, in the case of the
      embodiment variant described, to the output 8 of the
      digital-analog converter 41 of the microcomputer 18 via an
      amplifier 19 with the following specifications: passband from 10
      Hz to 20 kHz, gain 1 to 20, input sensitivity 250 mV, output power
      RMS 60 W under 8 ohms, signal to noise ratio 80 dB. The voltage at
      the terminals of the bobbin 51 has an amplitude of 5 Veff and the
      signal is applied for 10 minutes. The input terminals 8' of the
      applicator can also be, in the case of certain embodiment
      variants, directly connected to the output of the preamplifier 16
      or to the output 8 of the digital-analog converter 41 of the
      computer 17.<br>
      <br>
      [0069] The invention also relates to the methods making i t
      possible to control the correlation between on the one hand, said
      signal derived from the transducer 6 and on the other hand, the
      biological and/or chemical activity or the biological and/or
      chemical behaviour of said substance or said active element
      contained in said substance. This control is carried out by
      applying, by means of a transducer of the type described in
      reference to FIG. 1c, signals derived from the transducer 6 to a
      biological control system and verifying that said biological
      control system reacts in a specific manner to the signals derived
      from said first transducer. In the case where said signals are
      processed, it is these processed signals which are applied to said
      biological control system. The reaction of said biological control
      system must be in relation to the nature of the biological and/or
      chemical activity or the biological and/or chemical behaviour of
      said substance or said active element contained in said substance
      from which are issued the signals derived from said first
      transducer.<br>
      <br>
      [0070] As an example of a biological control system, an d
      referring to FIG. 2, a test will be described below derived from
      that known under the test name of a perfused isolated guinea-pig
      heart (or Langendorff experiment) and whose process is described
      in the work entitled: "Methods in Immunology and Immunochemistry"
      published by Williams and Chase, Academic Press 1976, particularly
      page 68; or further in the work entitled: "L'experimentation
      animate en cardiologie" INSERM Médecine-Science-Coll.

      H. Dehnart-Biomesstechnik-Verlag March GmbH, D-7806 March. In FIG.
      2 one recognises the diagram known from the Langendorff
      experiment. The equipment described in these works has been
      completed by a transducer in the form of a bobbin 60 of a
      varnished copper wire of diameter 0.5 mm, with a diameter of 110
      mm, a length of 40 mm and with an impedance of 4 ohms.<br>
      <br>
      [0071] Three experiments were carried out with characteristic
      electric signals coming respectively from the following
      substances:<br>
      <br>
      [0072] for the first, ionophoretic-calcium A 23187 (Sigma C-7522)
      (I) at a concentration of 10&lt;-6&gt;M in distilled water for
      injectable preparation (for example the Biosedra brand).<br>
      <br>
      [0073] for the second, distilled water for injectable preparation
      (for example the Biosedra brand). (E)<br>
      <br>
      [0074] for the third, caffeine (Sigma C-0750) (C) at a
      concentration of 10&lt;-6&gt;M in distilled water for injectable
      preparation (for example the Biosédra brand). (E)<br>
      <br>
      [0075] For each of these three experiments, the substances were
      placed in the container 3 of the chamber 2 and their
      characteristic electric signals were acquired in conformity with
      the operating process described with reference to FIGS. 1, 1a and
      1b.<br>
      <br>
      [0076] The three characteristic electric signals produced as
      described above were applied to the guinea-pig heart, connecting
      the terminals 8' of the bobbin 60 to the output of the amplifier
      19 of power 60 W. The three characteristic electric signals were
      applied for 2 minutes under a voltage of 5 Veff.<br>
      <br>
      [0077] The fraction collector collected the tubes making it
      possible to measure the debit of the guinea-pig heart at the rate
      of 1 tube per minute. The buffer solution crossing the heart had
      the following composition: CaCl 2 mM, NaHCO3 25 mM, NaCl 118 mM,
      MgSO4 1.2 mM, KHPO4 1.2 mM, Glucose 11 mM, Pyruvate 2 mM.<br>
      <br>

      [0080] Next, as an example, a description follows with reference
      to FIGS. 3, 3a, 3c and 3d of a precipitation test between the
      polysaccharidic antigen of Escherichia coli K1 and an antibody
      against this antigen making it possible to control the
      characteristic electric signals of the biological activity of
      Escheria coli. This test is defined below under the name of
      precipitation test.<br>
      <br>
      [0081] One tests the effects on a precipitation reaction between
      the polysaccharidic antigen of Escherichia coli K1 and an antibody
      directed against this antigen:<br>
      <br>
      [0082] from the application of a characteristic electric signal of
      the biological activity of an antigenic substance foreign to this
      reaction such as the Streptococcus,<br>
      <br>
      [0083] from the application of a characteristic electric signal of
      the biological activity of the polysaccharidic antigen of
      Escherichia coli,<br>
      <br>
      [0084] from the simultaneous application of a characteristic
      electric signal of the biological activity of Streptococcus and
      the characteristic electric signal of the biological activity of
      an antibody directed against Escherichia coli,<br>
      <br>
      [0085] from the simultaneous application of a characteristic
      electric signal of the biological activity of Escherichia coli and
      the characteristic electric signal of the biological activity of a
      n antibody directed against this antigen.<br>
      <br>
      [0086] The acquisition of the characteristic electric signals of
      the biological activities of Escherichia coli, of its specific
      antibody and of the polysaccharidic antigen of Streptococcus was
      carried out by means of the device 10 described with reference to
      FIGS. 1, 1a, 1b.<br>
      <br>
      [0087] The acquisition of the characteristic electric signal of
      the biological activity of Streptococcus was carried out by
      placing at the centre of the chamber 2 a container 3 holding 1 ml
      of an aqueous suspension of Streptococcus bacteria previously
      formalised (6.10&lt;6 &gt;cfu/ml).<br>
      <br>
      [0088] The acquisition of the characteristic electric signals of
      the biological activity of the specific antibody of Escherichia
      coli and its specific antibody was carried out by operating in the
      same manner, but using respectively:<br>
      <br>
      [0089] a container 3 holding 1 ml of an aqueous suspension of
      bacteria of Escherichia coli K1 previously formalised (6.10&lt;6
      &gt;cfu/ml).<br>
      <br>
      [0090] a container 3 holding 1 ml of a suspension of particles of
      a latex sensitised by a mouse monoclonal antibody specific of
      Escherichia coli K1, coming from a PASTOREX(R) MENINGITIS kit
      (Ref. 61709-SANOFI DIAGNOSTICS PASTEUR).<br>
      <br>
      [0091] The tests were carried out using as reagents:<br>
      <br>
      [0092] on the one hand, a solution of polysaccharidic antigen of
      Escherichia coli K1 prepared by dissolving an antigenic extract
      from a PASTOREX(R) MENINGITIS kit (Ref. 61709-SANOFI DIAGNOSTICS
      PASTEUR) in 1 ml of distilled and sterile water, then dilution to
      1/7, 1/7.5 or 1/8 in physiological serum; and<br>
      <br>
      [0093] on the other hand the latex sensitised by a mouse
      monoclonal antibody specific of Escherichia coli K1 present in
      this same kit, after dilution to 1/3 in physiological serum.<br>
      <br>
      [0094] For each of these tests, the following protocol was used:<br>
      <br>
      [0095] one places in an oven heated to 37[deg.] C. a transducer
      151 constituted by a bobbin measuring 120 mm in length and 25 mm
      internal diameter, with 631 turns and a resistance of 4.7 ohms and
      linked by its input terminal 8' to the output 8 of the
      digital-analog converter of a Soundblaster card and a computer 17
      (one could also use a computer 18 remotely) reinserting the
      recorded files constituted by the electric signals one wishes to
      apply for the time required to bring this transducer to the
      temperature of 37[deg.] C.;<br>
      <br>
      [0096] one deposits on a slide 147 supplied with a capillary 149
      in a serpentine shape (of the type of those provided in the
      PASTOREX MENINGITIS kits), at a small distance from the opening of
      the latter, a drop 145 (40 to 50 [mu]l) of the antigenic solution
      as described in point b) above, together with a drop 143 (also
      corresponding to a volume of 40 to 50 [mu]l), latex sensitised by
      the antibody, taking care that these drops do not mix.<br>
      <br>
      [0097] one applies, to the two drops of reagents thus deposited,
      the electric signal or signals desired by placing the slide at the
      centre of the transducer 151 for about 2 minutes and reinserting a
      sound file with the aid of the computer 17 (or the remote computer
      18),<br>
      <br>
      [0098] one mixes the two drops of reagents 143, 145 for about 10
      seconds and then leaves the reaction mixture in the oven for about
      13 minutes to migrate into the capillary and the precipitation
      reaction to take place:<br>
      <br>
      [0099] one takes the blade out of the oven and then proceeds to
      read this precipitation.<br>
      <br>
      [0100] This reading is carried out by analysis, by means of
      analysis software and image processing on a PC type computer using
      the WINDOWS(R) 95 operating system (MICROSOFT), of an image
      acquired with the aid of a video camera positioned on an optical
      microscope and connected to said computer by a video acquisition
      card. The camera works in the grey shades. A first processing
      increases the contrast, the threshold being set so that the
      precipitates appear in black, while the zones without latex
      particles or precipitates appear white.<br>
      <br>
      [0101] Based on the analysis of two-dimensional space spread of
      the dark zones of the image, the computer determines a
      precipitation index (I) calculated according to the formula: ***<br>
      <br>
      [0102] The precipitation index is accordingly higher when the size
      of the precipitates formed during the precipitation reaction is
      greater. The control test for the presence of a characteristic
      signal of the biological activity of Escherichia coli is
      considered as positive when, during an experiment, the application
      of characteristic electric signals of the biological activity of
      Escherichia coli and/or the biological activity of its specific
      antibody leads to obtaining a precipitation index significantly
      higher (by at least 40%) than the maximum of those obtained, under
      the same conditions, and over for example 3 experiments, after
      application of the characteristic electric signal of the
      biological activity of Streptococcus.<br>
      <br>
      [0103] Table A below shows the precipitation indexes obtained in a
      first series of tests aimed at comparing the effects of the
      application of characteristic electric signals of the biological
      activity of Escherichia coli (E. coli) coming from a biological
      system containing Escherichia coli with those observed after
      application, under the same reaction conditions, of characteristic
      electric signals of the biological activity of Streptococcus (St)
      coming from a biological system containing Streptococcus and for 3
      different dilutions (1/7, 1/7.5 and 1/8) of the polysaccharidic
      antigen of Escherichia coli K1 used as reagent in the
      precipitation reactions.<br>

      precipitates formed, on the one hand, after application of the
      characteristic electric signal of the biological activity of

      precipitates corresponding respectively to the precipitation

      <br>
      [0107] All these results demonstrate clearly the aptitude
      presented by a ligand/receptor couple for revealing and
      controlling the presence of a characteristic electric signal of
      the biological activity of a ligand and/or its receptor. In fact,
      in the presence of a specific characteristic signal of the
      ligand/receptor couple or one of the elements of this couple, the
      formation of complexes formed by the reaction between this ligand
      and this receptor is amplified. This amplification is very
      specific, since the characteristic electric signal of the
      biological activity of a biologically active element, but foreign
      to this reaction, does not itself produce this amplification
      effect.<br>
      <br>
      [0108] In the meaning of the present invention, the "ligand/
      receptor couple" means any couple formed by two substances able to
      recognise each other specifically, to link together and to act
      together to form complexes. Thus, it can concern an
      antigen/antibody couple, or hapten/antibody in which the ligand
      (the antigen or the hapten) can be a biological compound (protein,
      enzyme, hormone, toxin, tumour tag), a chemical compound (toxic or
      medicated active principle, for example), or a cell or particle
      antigen (cell, bacteria, virus, fungus, . . . ), the receptor
      being able to be a soluble antibody or a membranous receptor. It
      can also be a couple formed by an enzyme and its specific
      substrate.<br>
      <br>
      [0109] These results show clearly that it is possible to use
      ligand/receptor couples and, in general, test biological systems
      to constitute a correlation table between the characteristic
      signals issued from a determined substance or from an active
      element contained in a determined substance and the modifications
      they can induce on test biological systems, in particular such as
      a ligand/receptor couple.<br>
      <br>
      [0110] These correlation tables can be used later for detecting
      active elements by analysing the effects of characteristic signals
      coming from them on test biological systems recorded in the
      correlation table.<br>
      <br>
      [0111] As an example, with reference to FIG. 4, a presentation is
      given below of the test known under the name of guinea-pig
      cutaneous test and described in chapter 11 (p.346-351) in the
      second edition of "Immunology" edited by Jean-Francois Bach, coll.
      John Wiley &amp; Sons; or further in the 3rd edition of "The
      handbook of Experimental Immunology" edited by D. M. Weir, coll.
      Blackwell, Ch. 21 "Passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (PCA)" by W. E.
      Brocklehurst; or further in the work edited by Williams &amp;
      Chase entitled "Methods in IMMUNOLOGY and IMMUNOCHEMISTRY"-Vol.
      5-Ch. 19 "Anaphylaxis".<br>
      <br>
      [0112] The guinea-pig is used when still alive, and is given a n
      intravenous injection of a blue colorant (Evans blue-Sigma E 2129)
      which fixes on the blood albumin. The albumin does not leave the
      vessels, unless there is inflammation, and thus vasodilatation and
      permeability of the vessels, the typical example of such a
      reaction with man being urticaria.<br>
      <br>
      [0113] The test is carried out by injecting under the skin of the
      animal prepared in this way, 0.1 ml of the solution whose activity
      is to be controlled. Nextone measures the diameter of the blue
      marks appearing around the points of injection. In order to do
      this the skin is scanned, and then the bitmap image file is
      recorded. Finally the sizes of the blue marks due to the reaction
      are evaluated.<br>
      <br>
      [0114] In the example described, a control was carried out of the
      presence of signals characteristic of the biological activity of
      the acetylcholine neuromediator (ACh; Sigma A2661) in solution in
      a physiological solution, by analysing the effects o n the skin of
      a guinea-pig:<br>
      <br>
      [0115] on the one hand, of an injection of 0.1 ml distilled water,
      after applying to this distilled water a characteristic electric
      signal of the biological activity of acetylcholine,<br>
      <br>
      [0116] on the other hand, of an injection of 0.1 ml distilled
      water, after applying to this distilled water a characteristic
      electric signal of the biological activity of a product close to
      acetylcholine but inactive: the mixture acetate/choline (A-C) (A:
      Sigma S8625; C: Sigma C7017).<br>
      <br>
      [0117] The acquisition of the characteristic electric signals of
      the biological activities of acetylcholine and the acetate/choline
      mixture was carried out by means of the device 10 described with
      reference to FIGS. 1, 1a, 1b.<br>
      <br>
      [0118] The acquisition of the characteristic electric signal of
      the biological activity of acetylcholine was carried out by
      placing in the centre of the chamber 2 a container 3 holding 1 ml
      of a solution of acetylcholine in distilled water at the
      concentration of 10&lt;-6&gt;M.<br>
      <br>
      [0119] The acquisition of characteristic electric signals of the
      biological activity of the mixture acetate/acetylcholine was
      carried out by operating in the same manner, but using a container
      3 holding 1 ml of a solution of acetate/acetylcholine in distilled
      water at the concentration of 10&lt;-6&gt;M.<br>
      <br>
      [0120] For each of the tests, the following protocol was used:<br>
      <br>
      [0121] The bobbin 51 of FIG. 1c was used as applicator.<br>
      <br>

      distilled water injected after application of the ACh signal
      setoff a significant cutaneous reaction (average 11 mm) compared
      with the same solutions of distilled water injected without
      application of the ACh signal. The latter d o not setoff a

      the injections of solutions of distilled water after application
      of the ACh signal (experiments 200 to 204) have effects which are
      less, but comparable, on the guinea-pig skin to those of
      injections of ponderal ACh solutions (experiments 310 to 314).<br>

      [0125] Experiments numbered 400 to 404 and 410 to 412 in Table E
      are carried out from a product close to acetylcholine but
      inactive: the acetate/choline (A-C) mixture.<br>
      <br>
      [0126] Experiments 410, 411, 412, correspond to an injection of a
      ponderal solution of A-C 10&lt;-6&gt;M. One notes that an
      injection of distilled water solution after application of the A-C
      signal (exp. 400 to 404) and that a ponderal injection (exp. 410,
      411, 412) do not provoke any effect (diameter between 1 and 3 mm).
      These injections show that the cutaneous reaction of the
      guinea-pig is really specific to the nature of the substance in
      solution because these injections, carried out under the same
      conditions as the injections numbered 200 to 202, have no effect.<br>
      <br>
      [0127] The experiments of tables C to E make it evident that the
      guinea-pig skin test makes it possible to control the presence of
      a signal coming from a substance with a biological activity such
      as acetylcholine.<br>
      <br>
      [0128] Below is described the method used for controlling the
      following homeopathic products: arnica 7CH, acetylcholinum 7CH.<br>
      <br>
      [0129] First of all one has to produce the characteristic signals
      of the product to be tested. In the case where the homeopathic
      product to test is a solution, one proceeds by registering a
      sample of 1 ml as described in this patent. In the case where one
      wishes to test homeopathic granules, first of all a solution is
      prepared, for example 5 ml, by diluting 2 granules per ml of
      distilled water for injectable preparation (for example the
      Biosédra brand), and then one proceeds with the registering of a
      sample of 1 ml according to the method described in this patent.<br>
      <br>
      [0130] Nextone uses for example one or several of the three
      methods described above (perfused isolated guinea-pig heart;
      precipitation test of a ligand/receptor couple and cutaneous test
      on a guinea-pig). Since the correlation between the reaction of
      these biological control systems and the biological and/or
      chemical activity of the product having served to produce the
      homeopathic product has been demonstrated, a positive reaction of
      the biological control system will show the presence of the
      activity searched for in the homeopathic product tested. In the
      same way, a negative reaction of the biological control system
      will show the absence of the activity searched for in the
      homeopathic product tested.<br>

        Abstract</span> -- The invention concerns a method and a system
      for producing a signal, in particular an electric signal, or a
      substance having a coagulating or anticoagulant effect. The method
      is characterised in that it is based on a source substance with
      coagulating effect, in particular, Ca&lt;++&gt; ions, or an
      anticoagulant effect, in particular heparin. The method consists
      in: transforming (10) the electromagnetic field derived from said
      source substance located in the chamber (D), into a signal, in
      particular an electric signal, using a transducer-receiver sensing
      the electromagnetic field; applying (12) to a receiving substance
      located in the chamber (E), in particular water or a water-ethanol
      mixture or homeopathic granules, said signal derived from said
      transducer-receiver, using a transducer-transmitter. After said
      treatment, the receiving substance, initially inactive, has a
      coagulating or anticoagulant effect.<br>
      <br>
      Present invention relates to a process and a system to produce a
      substance or a signal, especially an electrical signal, having a
      coagulant effect or anticoagulant. The invention also relates to
      such a therapeutic substance or such signal and their effects. The
      invention also relates to a process and a system to test 1 '
      coagulant effect or anticoagulant of a substance or a signal.<br>
      <br>
      One knows, since the workings of Research of Mr Jacques
      Benveniste, especially those described in patent application WO
      94/17406 published on August 4, 1994, that one can collect
      starting from a biological and/or chemical element active such as
      a chemical compound, a cell or a microorganism, or starting from a
      substance containing this active element, a “electromagnetic
      signal characteristic of the biological activity and/or chemical
      or biological and/or chemical behavior " of the aforesaid
      substance and/or of the aforesaid active element contained in the
      aforementioned substance.<br>
      <br>
      One knows also that it is possible to transform, especially by
      means of a transducer, such an electromagnetic signal in an
      electrical signal.<br>
      <br>
      In the continuation of the text, one understands also by "
      electrical signal characteristic of the chemical biological
      activity and/or or the biological and/or chemical behavior of a
      substance or an active element contained in the aforementioned
      substance " any electrical signal derived by digitization and/or
      signal processing. In this expression, one employs "
      characteristic " in the direction where the physical parameters of
      the electrical signal are specific with substance or the active
      element contained in the aforementioned substance. In other words,
      the application of this electrical signal, via a transducer, a
      biological system of control allows: (I) to induce a biological
      activity and/or chemical on the aforementioned biological system
      of control in ratio with that of substance of origin or the active
      element which it contains, (II) to reveal a characteristic of
      substance or active element which it contains, with the origin of
      the aforesaid electrical signal.<br>
      <br>
      Patent application WO 94/17406, published on August 4, 1994,
      described a process and an apparatus to collect " an
      electromagnetic signal characteristic of a biological activity
      and/or chemical or a biological and/or chemical behavior to start
      from a biological and/or chemical element active such as a
      chemical compound, a cell or a microorganism, or starting from a
      substance containing this active element such as a purified
      preparation, a biological taking away, a living being.<br>
      <br>
      The inventors have since exposed that it is possible to improve
      the electromagnetic signal quality collected as well as the
      reliability of the production method of this signal and that it is
      consequently possible to produce a capable electrical signal
      characteristic of industrial applications.<br>
      <br>
      These developments were described in the French application FR 98
      12.058 deposited on September 23, 1998. As a requirement, the
      elements of this application, not yet published to date, useful
      with the comprehension of the present invention, will be extracted
      and inserted in the present application.<br>

      <br>
      The recording of the electrical signal characteristic, or that of
      the electrical signal which in drift after amplification or
      treatment, can be carried out into analogue by a recorder of
      signal, especially on magnetic tape, adapt with the frequencies of
      the electrical signal characteristic to the outlet of
      transducer-receptor 6. As the passband used corresponds to the
      audio tape, one can especially use a tape recorder. Output
      terminal 9 ' of transducer-receptor 6 is connected to the inlet
      microphone or the inlet line of such a tape recorder. During the
      reading, the electrical signal characteristic recorded is
      collected with one output terminal, especially with the outlet
      line or the outlet loudspeaker of tape recorder.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">Digital recording</span><br
        style="font-style: italic;">
      <br>
      Preferably, one carries out a digital recording of the signal
      electrical characteristic after analog-to-digital conversion of
      the aforesaid signal. For this purpose, one uses a microcomputer
      17, provided with a card of signal acquisition 25. Microcomputer
      17 comprises moreover one microprocessor 27, an interface of
      input/output 29, a controller 31 of one mass memory 33 and one
      interface video 35 connected by one or more bus 37. One can for
      example use a computer of type PC 17, operative under the
      operating system Windows 95 of Company MICROSOFT This
      microcomputer can be same type that that used to generate the
      excitation field. It can be the same microcomputer. Outlet 9 '
      transducer-receptor 6 or amplifier-preamplifier 16 is connected to
      inlet 9 of the analog-to-digital converter 39 of card 25 of
      computer 17. Preferably, the analogue converter digital 39 A a
      great resolution with 12 bits. It is advantageously equal with 16
      bits. Preferably also, the converter analog-to-digital 39 A a
      double frequency of sampling of maximum frequency that one wants
      to be able to digitize, for example 44 Khz.<br>
      <br>
      One proceeds to an electrical signal acquisition characteristic
      pendent one duration for example ranging between 1 and 60 S (for
      example 6 dry) and one records the digital file in a mass memory
      33, for example in the shape of a file its to format WAV.<br>
      <br>
      All the connections are carried out in shielded cable. All the
      apparatuses are put with the mass.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">Electrical signal processing
        characteristic</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
      <br>
      For the electrical signal processing characteristic or signal
      which in derives, one advantageously uses the Matlab software of
      the company " Tea MathWorks ".<br>
      <br>
      The digital file, recorded like it was described above, can
      optionally undergo a digital processing, such as for example a
      digital amplification for calibration of the signal level, a
      filtering for the removing of nondesired frequencies, or be
      transformed into its spectrum by a discrete transform of FOURIER,
      preferably by the algorithm of rapid transform of FOURIER (FTT in
      Anglo-Saxon tenninology). The duration of the generated signal can
      be increased while repeating in a file several times a fragment or
      the whole of the fichierson product in an original manner.<br>
      <br>
      Processing means of the electrical signal characteristic can be
      used to improve the performances of the electrical signal
      characteristic.<br>
      <br>
      In the case of a first variant of performing, it is envisaged a
      second transducer-receptor of the same type that that previously
      described. In the absence of the aforementioned substance, this
      second transducer-receptor transforms the excitation field into an
      electrical signal. This electrical signal is withdrawn by a branch
      in series opposition with the signal coming from the first
      transducer-receptor. One thus obtains an electrical signal
      characteristic more representative of the interaction of the
      specific excitation field and substance.<br>
      <br>
      In the case of a second variant of performing, the processing
      means take into account the characteristics of the specific
      excitation field and reprocess the electrical signal
      characteristic in the following way. One proceeds first of all to
      the calculating of the distribution of spectral power (PSD). Then
      one truncates this spectral power while not preserving that the
      strip of the frequencies going for example of 140 Hz at 14 Khz,
      one reconstitutes a signal starting from this spectral power and
      of neutral phases, for example generated by chance, finally one
      gauge the signal power thus product. By neutral phases, one
      indicates phases not coming from a substance source presenting a
      biological activity.<br>
      <br>
      In the case of the variant of performing described while referring
      to figures 1, lb, LLC, it is envisaged to digitize, record and
      treat the electrical signal characteristic before applying it to a
      receiving substance or a biological system of control or to a
      sensitive biological system.<br>
      <br>
      These operations are not indispensable to 1 ' exploitation of the
      electrical signal characteristic of the ion Ca++ or heparin, same
      if they support the bringing in work of it.<br>
      <br>
      The electrical signal characteristic available with the outlet of
      transducteurreceptor 6 and if necessary of preamplifier 16 already
      constitutes in oneself a capable product of industrial
      applications. One will see hereafter for which applications it can
      be especially implemented by means of an applicator 12 making it
      possible to apply them to a receiving substance or a biological
      system of control or a sensitive biological system.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">II. Remote transmission of the
        electrical signal characteristic</span><br style="font-style:
        italic;">
      <br>
      The file of the electrical signal characteristic of the ion Ca++
      or heparin, recorded in digital form as it has been just
      described, optionally after treatment, can be transferred remotely
      by a computerized communication network. This array can comprise
      microwave links 11. The file of the electrical signal
      characteristic of the ion Ca++ or heparin, thus transmitted, is
      recorded by the mass memory of a microcomputer 18. One can for
      example use a computer of type PC, operative under the operating
      system Windows 95 of Company MICROSOFT. This microcomputer 18 can
      be same type that that used to generate the excitation field. The
      file of the electrical signal characteristic digitized, thus
      recorded by remote microcomputer 18, can be exploited, of known
      manner in oneself, to produce an analogue electrical signal
      characteristic. The file, optionally treated, is transformed by a
      digital-to-analog converter 41 of card 25 (or a separate card) of
      computer 18. The digital-to-analog converter 41 delivers on its
      outlet 8 an analogue electrical signal characteristic of the
      biological activity of the ion Ca++ or heparin from which it
      results. This analogue electrical signal can be transformed, as it
      will be described hereafter, in electromagnetic and applied field
      with a receiving substance or a biological system of control or a
      sensitive biological system. in. The applicator of the
      characteristic signal of the ion Cl++ or heparin<br>
      <br>
      One now will describe, while referring to figure LLC, an example
      of performing of a system allowing to apply the electrical signal
      characteristic of the ion Ca++ or heparin to a biological system
      receptor and to modify the chemical behavior of it.<br>

      transducer-emitter 51, typically a coil. The coil has for example
      a length of 80 mms, an inner diameter of 50 mms, an outer diameter
      of 55 mms. It present 300 turns of a wire of diameter 0, 5 mms.
      Its impedance is of 4 ohms. Coil 51 is connected to the mass.
      Without that representing any restrictive character, coil 51 of
      the transducer-emitter has a vertical axis allowing the
      introduction of container 50 container the biological system

      the analog-to-digital converter 41 of microcomputer 18 via an
      amplifier 19 having the following features: passband of 10 Hz with
      20 Khz, profit 1 to 20, sensitivity of inlet 250 mV, output power
      RMS 60W under 8 ohms, ratio signal on noise 80 dB. The tension

      The invention concerns a method applied to a substance treated to
      exhibit a biological activity, for example a coagulating or
      anticoagulation activity. The treated substance has been obtained,
      from a source substance having the biological activity, after a
      treatment such that the treated substance does not contain any
      molecule of the source substance in significant amount. The
      treatment may consist in carrying out a high dilution process of
      the type used for producing homeopathic solutions or granules. The
      method is designed to diagnose potential alterations of the
      treated substance by external factors. It comprises the step which
      consists in: placing a reference substance sample in a zone (19)
      protected from external influence; subjecting a sample of the
      treated substance to external influence (20); comparing the
      results of the tests carried out using a biological control system
      respectively with the reference substance sample and the treated
      substance sample. Thus, if the results of the tests are different,
      the alterations of the treated substance by external influence
      (20) are demonstrated. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>

      present initially no biological activity particular, especially of
      1 ' water, so that it present after processing a biological
      activity. The receiving substance after processing is called
      hereafter the " Substance Treated " (or Informed Material). When
      the receiving substance is water, the Treated Substance is called
      L " 'Water Treated " (or of Informed Water). The substance having
      a biological activity can be also appeared as preparation or
      homeopathic granules.<br>
      <br>
      It will be pointed out, later in the description of the present
      invention, how one can produce of 1 ' Informed Water, starting
      from a substance parent, especially a substance parent having an
      anticoagulant effect such as heparin. This return will be carried
      out by reference with the patent NR WO 00/17637 published on March
      30, 2000 and having for titre " Method and system to produce a
      substance or a signal having a coagulant effect or anticoagulant.
      Therapeutic applications of the aforesaid substance or of the
      aforesaid signal. “<br>
      <br>
      Like that was described in patent NR WO 00/17637, to test a
      Treated Substance, especially of Informed Water, one it applique
      with a sensitive biological system to observe the effects of them.
      For example, if one tests Informed Water having a coagulant
      effect, or anticoagulant, one mixture respectively in the
      following proportions (1/3,2/3) of Informed Water and the plasma.
      Then one measuring times of coagulation.<br>
      <br>
      Such tests are particularly sensitive with interfering phenomena.
      The inventors noted of manner surprising and not explained that
      certain individuals have an inhibiting effect or potentialisator
      on Informed Water. For example, it is enough for them to approach
      Water Informed to deteriorate the properties of them. Other
      individuals on the other hand amplify the effects of the
      properties of Informed Water.<br>
      <br>
      It would be desirable to know, a priori, the individuals having
      such capacities since, by their presence, they can act of positive
      or negative manner on the properties of Informed Water. They can
      thus compromise the implementation of the industrial applications
      of this one. For example, the transport and handling, by such
      persons, of Substances Traitées constitutes an obstacle (the
      activity is faded) with the industrial development of these
      substances. Such is thus the problem posed.<br>
      <br>
      How to diagnose the persons having such effects of inhibition or
      potentiating?<br>
      <br>
      There is no state of the known art proposing a solution with the
      problem posed. The reason in is single: on the one hand, until the
      workings of search of the inventors, it was not known that one
      could modify the activity of 1 ' water, on the other hand, one was
      unaware of that unknown phenomena could remotely deteriorate the
      biological properties of Informed Water.<br>
      <br>
      The invention relates to a method to diagnose the potential
      alterations of a substance having biological activities of a
      substance source not being more present in significant amount.<br>
      <br>
      The method is applied with a substance presenting a biological
      activity, for example a coagulating or anticoagulant activity. The
      substance was obtained, starting from a substance source
      possessing the biological activity, at the end of a processing
      such as substance does not contain a molecule of the substance
      source in significant amount (the substance is called hereafter
      the treated substance). The processing can especially consist in
      implementing a method of high dilution of Mrs. nature that that
      used to produce homeopathic solutions or granules. The processing
      can also especially consist in implementing the method of Jacques
      Benveniste, comprising several steps, as described in the patent
      NR WO 00/17637 published on March 30, 2000 and having for titre "

      Other characteristics and advantages of the invention will appear

      <br>
      One first of all will recall how one can produce of 1 " informed
      water ", starting from a substance parent having an anticoagulant
      effect, especially of heparin. <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Figures 1 and 2</span> represent
      a system in conformity with that described in the patent NR WO
      00/17637 published on March 30, 2000 and having for titre " Method
      and system to produce a substance or a signal having a coagulant

      substance or of the aforesaid signal. “The system makes it
      possible to produce, starting from a substance parent, electrical
      signals, characteristics of its biological activity. In the
      present case, the substance parent is heparin 1 having an
      anticoagulant effect. The system includes/understands a
      cylindrical enclosure 2, provided with an insulating shield 1 '
      enclosure 2 of the parasitic fields coming from the environment.<br>
      <br>
      <div style="text-align: center;"><img src="wo0204958a.jpg" alt=""></div>
      <div style="text-align: center;"><img src="wo0204958b.jpg" alt=""></div>
      <div style="text-align: center;"><br>
      </div>
      Enclosure 2 is closed by an also shielded cover 5. A transmitter 4
      is located inside the enclosure. It generates a determined
      excitation field of electromagnetic nature. The transmitter is
      supplied by a generator 7 designed to generate a signal low
      frequency, especially signals square or sinusoidal low frequency,
      pink noise or, advantageously, white noise. Like one represented
      it, generator 7 takes the shape of a microcomputer 7, provided
      with a card its comprising an analog-to-digital converter. The
      converter comprises an output terminal 8. Output terminal 8 of the
      card its of microcomputer 7 is connected to the input terminal 8a
      transmitter 4, via an amplifier 9.<br>
      <br>
      In enclosure 2 are placed a tank 3 into plastic containing lml
      heparin as well as a transducer-receptor 6. Transducteurreceptor 6
      receives the resulting fields of the interaction of the specific
      excitation field and heparin 1. Transducer-receptor 6 transforms
      these fields into electrical signals. These electrical signals are
      presented, to outputted the 10 of transducer-receptor 6, in the
      shape of a difference in potential variable or a variable electric
      current of intensity. The electrical signals available to
      outputted the 10 of transducer-receptor 6 are amplified by a
      preamplifier 11. The electrical signals, after analog-to-digital
      conversion, make the object of a digital recording. For this
      purpose, one uses a microcomputer 7a, of Mrs. type that
      microcomputer 7, comprising an analog-to-digital converter.
      Outputted the 10 of transducer-receptor 6 is connected to the
      input 10a analog-to-digital converter of the microcomputer 7a, via
      preamplifier 11. Moreover, like one represented it on figure 2,
      the system allows to produce of 1 " informed water ", starting
      from the electrical signals, obtained thus that one described it
      above. In a tank 14 into plastic is placed a receiving substance,
      not presenting any particular biological activity initially,
      especially of water.<br>
      <br>
      This tank 14 is laid out in a radiated electromagnetic field by a
      transducer-transmitter 13, in the present case a coil 13. Input
      terminals 12 of coil 13 are connected to outputted the 12a of an
      analog-to-digital converter of a microcomputer 15, via an
      amplifier 16.<br>
      <br>
      Microcomputer 15 contains in memory the electrical signals
      digitized by means of microcomputer 7. The comprising
      microcomputer the 15 analog-to-digital converter similar with
      microcomputer 7, is previously described. The analog-to-digital
      converter product of the electrical signals starting from the
      digital recording.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, by applying the electrical signals to receiving substance,
      contained in the tank 14, by means of transducer-transmitter 13,
      one obtains from 1 ' informed water presenting an anticoagulant
      activity. Informed water thus obtained is capable industrial
      applications, in so far as its properties are not faded. Like one
      exposed it in the preamble of present description, certain
      individuals have an inhibiting effect or, contrary,
      potentialisator on 1 ' informed water, especially when they handle
      a tube containing of 1 ' informed water.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Figure 3</span> presents a
      schematic view of the method and system, in accordance with the
      invention, allowing to diagnose the potential alterations of 1 "

      inhibiting effect or potentialisator whom an individual 20 can
      produce out of 1 ' informed water, by handling the tube which
      contains it. A tube 17a and a tube 18a contain of 1 ' informed
      water presenting an anticoagulant activity.<br>
      <br>
      Informed water was previously produced like one described it
      cidessus. The tube 17a is placed in an enclosure 19. Enclosure 19
      is surrounded by a magnetic shield 19a, carried out out of soft
      iron or mumétal.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, the tube 17a is located at the shelter of the potential
      alterations of individual 20. The tube 18a is subjected to the
      influence of individual 20. For this making, individual 20 seizes
      in his hand 20a the tube 18a, pendent one determined duration, for
      example thirty seconds.<br>

      the heparin, contained in the tubes 17a and 18a, reacts in
      accordance with the biological activity of heparin. To arrive to
      this confirmation, one mixture plasma with 1 ' water informed in
      the tubes 17a and 18a, then one lets incubate pendent 15 to 20
      minutes.<br>
      <br>
      One measuring then the coagulation of the plasma in the tubes 17a
      and 18a. If the speeds of coagulation observed differ, one deduces
      from it that individual 20 deteriorated the properties of 1 '
      informed water. Accurately, if the coagulation observed in the
      tube 18a is carried out substantially rapidly than in the tube
      17a, one deduces from it that the individual has a capacity of
      inhibition of 1 ' informed water. Contrary, if the coagulation
      observed in the tube 18a is carried out substantially slowly than
      in the tube 17a, one deduces from it that the individual has a
      capacity of potentiating of 1 ' informed water.<br>

      The invention concerns a method for amplifying the formation of
      complexes between the two elements of a ligand/receptor pair and
      its uses for detecting the presence of a substance corresponding
      to one of the two elements of a ligand/receptor pair in a sample
      and the electromagnetic signal characteristic of a substance
      biological activity corresponding to one of the two elements of a
      ligand/receptor pair in an electromagnetic signal. Said
      amplification method consists in: contacting the two elements of
      the ligand/receptor pair in conditions ensuring their reaction;
      prior to, simultaneously with or subsequent to said contacting,
      applying to one and/or the other of said elements an
      electromagnetic signal characteristic of the biological activity
      of one and/or the other of said elements. The invention is
      applicable to biological diagnosis in human and veterinary
      medicine, bacteriological control in the pharmaceutical, cosmetic
      and food industry.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention refers to a method amplification of the
      formation the complex ones between the two elements of a couple
      ligand/receptor, with a method and with a detecting apparatus of
      the presence, in a sample (hereafter “analytic sample”), of a
      substance corresponding one to the one of the two elements of a
      couple ligand/receptor, implementing this method of amplification,
      with the applications of this detecting method, like a detecting
      method of the presence has, in an electromagnetic signal,
      electromagnetic signal characteristic of the biological activity
      of a substance corresponding one to the one of the two elements of
      a couple ligand/receptor, putting also in work the aforementioned
      method of amplification.<br>
      <br>
      To detect the presence of an analytic substance in a sample, one
      proposed very numerous based methods on the capacity of this
      substance specifically to be bound to another substance and to
      react with it.<br>
      <br>
      In particular, the properties of affinity which the antibodies
      with respect to the antigens present are at the base of a large
      number of immunologic methods of detection which have jointly to
      use the formation of complex antigènesanticorps it sought
      substance being able tre either the antigen, or it antibody-and to
      detect, to even quantify, complex the thus formed ones.<br>
      <br>
      As immunologic examples of methods of detection which are very
      frequently used, one can quote the immunoprecipitation, the
      agglutination reactions, dialysis with the equilibrium, the
      extinction of fluorescence, the fluorescence polarization, the
      immunoelectrophoresis, counterimmunoelectrophoresis or
      électrosynérèse, proportionings radioimmunological (RIA),
      enzymatic proportionings immuno- (ELISA) or the
      immunofluorescence.<br>
      <br>
      These immunologic methods of detection, if they have large
      qualities incontestably, do not give however completely
      satisfaction.<br>
      <br>
      Initially, their sensitivity (which is defined by the minimum
      concentration of sought substance that these methods detect) is,
      in the majority of the cases, insufficient. Thus, BERZOFSKY and
      BERKOWER (Antigen-Antibody Interaction, In: WE Paul, Fundamental
      Immunology, RAVEN NEAR, New York, 1984,595) showed that,
      concerning for example the detection of the antibodies, except for
      the tests of neutralizing of the phages with which it is possible
      to detect the presence of only one antibody molecule but of which
      the use extrmement is extrmement limited, very sparingly of
      methods have a low sensitivity with 10 ng of antibody per ml of
      sample.<br>
      <br>
      It is thus desirable to develop the new technical ones which makes
      it possible to lower the detection threshold of a sought
      substance.<br>
      <br>
      In addition, all the immunologic detection methods suggested to
      date include/understand a step which consists in incubating a
      volume determined-which is generally at least 500 SSL-of the
      taking away to be analyzed with a specific reagent and this, for
      each sought substance. So they present the disadvantage of
      requiring, as soon as the analysis of a door taking away on
      several substance-like that is very often the case of the medical
      analyses with diagnostic sight, a taking away of a relatively
      substantial volume, which is not always well supported by the
      patients, especially in the case of blood taking away.<br>
      <br>
      Moreover, the fact that these detection methods requires, for
      their implementation, to have of the taking away to analyze or, at
      the very least, a sample of this one, is not without presenting a
      certain number of constrained. Indeed:<br>
      - of an hand, it is frequent that taking away taking place given
      with preserved analyses owe tre so that the reliability of these
      analyses can tre subsequently controlled or that complementary
      analyses can tre carried out. Thus, for example, the centers of
      blood transfusion, the services of legal medicine and the tissue
      centers of taking away preserve samples of all the biological
      taking away which they are brought to carry out. This
      conservation, which is carried out by congelation of the aforesaid
      samples, in addition to having a nonnegligible cost, requires
      equipments and the local adapt ones.<br>

      - of another hand, it is also frequent that taking away cannot tre
      analyzed on the place where they were carried out and which it is
      necessary to convey them to the loaded laboratory to carry out the
      analysis of it. Gold, the routing of biological taking away, in
      addition to that it is never very easy to implement because of the
      low shelf life of biological substances in the absence of
      congelation, poses a certain number of difficulties when these
      taking away are potentially contaminating. Moreover, the duration
      of such a routing differs from as much the obtaining of the
      results of the analysis.<br>
      <br>
      The problem is posed, consequently, to provide a method which
      makes it possible to detect the presence of a substance in a
      sample with, at the same time, a very large sensitivity and an
      high specificity, while offering the possibility as many carry out
      analyses as necessary starting from microsamples, free, moreover,
      of constrained of conservation, forwarding and transport of the
      taking away which present the methods currently used for detection
      of a substance, and which can, moreover, tre implemented readily
      and rapidly without requiring an heavy and expensive equipment.<br>
      <br>
      Gold, in the frame of their workings on the transmission of a
      biological activity in the shape of an electromagnetic signal, the
      Inventors noted that the application, with the one and/or the
      other of the elements of a couple ligand/receptor such as a couple
      antigen/antibody, electromagnetic signal characteristic of the
      biological activity of the one and/or the other of these elements
      has, in a way completely surprising, for effect to amplify the
      formation of complex between the two elements of this couple when
      these last is put to react together and this, of very specific
      manner, and had the idea to put at profit this effect to detect on
      the one hand, presence of an analytic substance in a sample and,
      in addition, the presence of the electromagnetic signal
      characteristic of the biological activity of a substance in an
      electromagnetic radiation.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention has, therefore, for object a method of
      amplification of the formation the complex ones between the two
      elements of a couple ligand/receptor by reaction of these two
      elements, which method is characterized in what it
      includes/understands:<br>
      <br>
      put it in contact of the two elements of the couple
      ligand/receptor under conditions suitable to allow their reaction,
      and previously, simultaneously or subsequently to this setting in
      contact, the application with the one and/or the other of these
      elements of the electromagnetic signal characteristic of the
      biological activity of the one and/or other of the aforesaid
      elements.<br>
      <br>
      Within the meaning of the present invention, one understands by "
      couple ligand/receptor ", any formed couple by two substances
      capable to be recognized specifically, to bind and react together
      by forming the complex ones. Thus, it can be a question of a
      couple antigen/antibody or hapten/antibody in which the ligand
      (antigen or hapten) can tre a biological compound (protein,
      enzyme, hormone, toxin, tumorous marker,…), a chemical compound
      (medicinal active principle for example), or a cellular or
      particulate antigen (cell, bacterium, virus, mushroom,…), the
      receptor which can tre a soluble antibody or a membrane receptor.
      It can also be a question of a formed couple by an enzyme and its
      specific substrate.<br>
      <br>
      In addition, one understands by " electromagnetic signal
      characteristic of the biological activity " of an element, the
      electromagnetic signal collected starting from a biologically
      active element such as a substance, a cell or a microorganism,…,
      or of a material containing this element such as a purified
      preparation, a biological taking away, a body or a living tre,
      like that was described in International application WO 94/17406
      in the name of J. BENVENISTE. One understands also by "
      electromagnetic signal characteristic of the biological activity "
      of an element, the derived signals of a signal such as defined
      above by digitization and/or signal processing. In addition, in
      this expression, one employs the term “characteristic " in the
      direction where the collected electromagnetic signal contains
      information characterizing the fact that the material from which
      is collected this signal present the biological activity in
      question. The electromagnetic signal collected starting from an
      hardware containing a plurality of biologically active elements
      present the biological activity of each element which it contains.<br>
      <br>
      According to a prefered first mode of implementation of the method
      of amplification in conformity with the Invention, the reaction
      between the ligand and the receptor is carried out by using two
      reagents respectively containing the ligand and the receptor, and
      one applique, with the one and/or the other of these reagents, an
      electromagnetic signal to test and suspect to include/understand
      the electromagnetic signal characteristic of the biological
      activity of this ligand and/or this receptor.<br>
      <br>
      In what precedes and in what follows, one indicates under the term
      of “réactif', any preparation whose composition is known, which
      contains the ligand or the receptor in an amount also known and
      present either in a dry form such as one was freeze-dried to
      reconstitute in a solvent, or in a liquid form such as a solution
      or a suspension, the ligand or the attached receptor being able
      tre on a solid phase (particles or balls of latex, glass or
      polystyrene,…).<br>
      <br>
      According to a first advantageous provision of this first mode of
      implementation, the application, with the one and/or the other of
      reagents, electromagnetic signal to be tested is carried out by
      exposure of a solution or a suspension containing one and/or the
      other of these reagents, with this electromagnetic signal.<br>
      <br>
      In variant, the application, with the one and/or the other of
      reagents, electromagnetic signal to be tested is carried out by
      dilution of a solution or a suspension comprising one and/or the
      other of these reagents, in a solvent having been previously
      exposed to this electromagnetic signal.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, for example, when the reagents which one wishes to use are
      in solution or suspension in a liquid phase, it is possible to
      apply the electromagnetic signal to them to be tested:<br>
      <br>
      * is previously with their use: by exposing one and/or the other
      of these reagents or aliquot of the one and/or the other of<br>
      these reagents with this electromagnetic signal, or in diluent one
      and/or other of the aforesaid reagents or their aliquot in a
      volume of one solvent having been previously exposed to the said
      electromagnetic signal,<br>
      <br>
      * is at the time of the implementation of the method of
      amplification in conformity with the Invention: Zen exposing to
      this electromagnetic signal aliquot of each one of these reagents,
      after deposit of these aliquot on a support (blade for example)
      but previously with their setting in contact, or mixing aliquot
      first reagent with aliquot of second reagent on a support or in a
      tube, and by exposing this mixture to the signal electromagnetic,
      or by mixing aliquot first reagent with aliquot of second reagent
      on a support or in a tube and into diluent this mixture in a
      volume of one solvent having been previously exposed to that the
      electromagnetic signal.<br>
      <br>
      According to another advantageous provision of this first mode of
      implementation, the application, with the one and/or the other of
      reagents, electromagnetic signal to be tested is carried out by
      dissolution or setting in suspension of this or these reagents in
      a solvent having been previously exposed to this electromagnetic
      signal. This present provision a very particular intért when the
      reagents which one wishes to use, are in a form dehydrated such as
      a lyophilisate, since it is then possible to apply the
      electromagnetic signal to them to be tested simply by dissolving
      them or by putting them in suspension according to case's, in a
      volume of a solvent having been previously exposed to this
      electromagnetic signal.<br>
      <br>
      Advantageously, the electromagnetic signal to be tested is an
      electromagnetic signal collected starting from a test sample and
      suspect to contain this ligand and/or this receptor, this sample
      being able tre as well resulting from a biological taking away
      (blood, urine, milk,…) that of a nonbiological taking away (water,
      food product, pharmaceutical product, cosmetic product,…).<br>
      <br>
      In variant, the electromagnetic signal to be tested also can tre a
      radiated electromagnetic signal by a source of electromagnetic
      radiation, especially a source suspectée to emit an harmful
      radiation for the living tre of the type line high-tension,
      transformer, electric motor, furnace with microwaves, particle
      accelerator, ray source X,… From Mrs., the electromagnetic signal
      to be tested can come from the acquisition of a mechanical signal
      like vibrations, of an electrostatic or different signal.<br>
      <br>
      According to a second mode of implementation prefered of the
      method of amplification in conformity with the Invention, the
      reaction between the ligand and the receptor are produced by
      putting in contact a test sample and suspect to contain the ligand
      and/or the receptor, with a reagent containing either the
      receptor, or the ligand (according to present substance suspectée
      tre in the analytic sample with which one wishes to make react
      this reagent), and one applique, with this sample and/or this
      reagent, the of the aforesaid electromagnetic signal
      characteristic of the biological activity ligand and/or of the
      aforesaid receptor.<br>
      <br>
      According to a first advantageous provision of this second mode of
      implementation, the application, with the test sample,
      electromagnetic signal characteristic of the biological activity
      of the ligand and/or receptor is carried out by exposure of this
      sample to this or these electromagnetic signals, or by dilution of
      this sample in a solvent having been previously exposed to (X)
      said (S) the signal (with) electromagnetic (S).<br>
      <br>
      According to another advantageous provision of this second mode of
      implementation, the application, with reagent intended to react
      with the test sample, of the electromagnetic signal characteristic
      of the biological activity of the ligand and/or the receptor is
      carried out by exposure of a solution or a suspension containing
      this reagent to this or these electromagnetic signals, or by
      dilution of such a solution or suspension in a solvent having been
      previously exposed to this or these electromagnetic signals, or by
      dissolution or setting in suspension of this reagent in a solvent
      having been previously exposed to (X) said (S) the signal (with)
      electromagnetic (S).<br>
      <br>
      In variant, one applique, with the test sample and reagent
      intended to react with him, the electromagnetic signal
      characteristic of the biological activity of the ligand and/or the
      receptor, by exposure of a solution or a suspension containing
      this sample and this reagent to this or these electro signals
      magnetic, or by dilution of such a solution or suspension in a
      solvent having been previously exposed to (X) said (S) the signal
      (with) electromagnetic (S).<br>
      <br>
      According to a provision particularly prefered of this second mode
      of implementation, one applique, with the test sample and/or
      reagent intended to react with him, at the same time the
      electromagnetic signal characteristic of the biological activity
      of the ligand and the electromagnetic signal characteristic of the
      biological activity of the receptor. Indeed, the Inventors noted
      that, if it is enough to apply, with the elements of the couple
      ligand/receptor, the electromagnetic signal characteristic of the
      biological activity of only one of these elements to obtain an
      amplification of complex formed by their reaction, this
      amplification is higher when one applique with these elements
      simultaneously the electromagnetic signals characteristics of the
      biological activity of each one of them.<br>
      <br>
      Whatever the mode of setting of work of the method of
      amplification in conformity with the Invention, the solvent having
      been previously exposed to (X) the signal (with) electromagnetic
      (S) is advantageously of 1 ' water or the physiological solute.<br>
      <br>
      Capable reagents of tre used in the method of amplification in
      conformity with the Invention and containing the ligand on the one
      hand, and the receptor on the other hand, can as well tre of the
      available reagents prts to employment in the trade as of reagents
      especially designed and prepared for the implementation of this
      method. In addition to the fact that, as mentioned herebefore,
      these reagents can be presented in different forms (dry,
      liquid,…), they can, in addition, tre coupled to a marker such as
      a radioactive isotope, an enzyme, a fluorescent substance, a
      coloured particle, biotin or a compound organometallic, suitable
      to allow the detection and/or the measuring of the complex
      ligands-receptors resulting of the reaction between the ligand and
      the receptor.<br>
      <br>
      The method of amplification advantageously includes/understands,
      moreover, one acquisition step of the electromagnetic signal
      characteristic of the biological activity of the one and/or the
      other of the elements of the couple ligand/receptor.<br>
      <br>
      As previously indicated, the electromagnetic signal characteristic
      of the biological activity of the one and/or the other of the
      elements of the couple ligand/receptor can come either from a test
      sample and suspect to contain this or these elements, or of a
      source of electromagnetic radiation or acquisition of a mechanical
      signal (vibrations), electrostatic or different, or still of
      reagents containing the ligand or the receptor in solution or
      suspension in a solvent, according to modes' of implementations of
      the method of amplification in conformity with the Invention.<br>
      <br>
      Of manner particularly advantageous, the method of amplification
      in conformity with the Invention includes/understands, also, a
      step of recording and of playback of information representative of
      the electromagnetic signal characteristic of the biological
      activity of the one and/or the other of the elements of the couple
      ligand/receptor. Thus, the electromagnetic signal characteristic
      of the biological activity of an analytic sample, once recorded,
      can tre preserved indefinitely and used as many time as necessary.
      Of similar manner, the electromagnetic signals characteristics of
      the biological activity of the ligand and biological activity of
      the receptor collected starting from reagents, can tre once
      recorded for all and tre used to carry out a plurality of
      reactions bringing into play this ligand and this receptor.<br>
      <br>
      The method of amplification includes/understands advantageously,
      moreover, a detecting step of complex resulting of the reaction
      between the ligand and the receptor and, optionally, of measuring
      of these complex. This step can be advantageously supplemented by
      the comparing of the results obtained with those observed for a
      reaction serving of " witness ", i.e. a reaction led with Mrs.
      couples ligand/receptor and in reactional conditions Mrs., but
      without application of an electromagnetic signal with the elements
      of this couple, that it is previously, simultaneously or
      subsequently to their setting in contact.<br>
      <br>
      The detection and/or the measuring of the complex
      ligands-receptors are capable of tre carried out by all the
      methods conventionally used to reveal and quantify the formation
      of such complex. Thus, in the case of complex antigen-antibodies,
      it is possible to as well use a revelation by agglutination,
      immunoprecipitation, extinction of fluorescence, fluorescence
      polarization that a radioimmunological, immuno-enzymatic test or a
      test of immuno-fluorescence.<br>
      <br>
      According to a mode of implementation particularly prefered of the
      method of amplification in conformity with the Invention, the
      ligand is an antigen or a hapten, while the receptor is an
      antibody or a membrane receptor directed specifically against this
      ligand.<br>
      <br>
      Of manner particularly advantageous, the reaction between this
      ligand and this receptor is a reaction revealed by agglutination,
      because of its simplicity and of its speed of execution.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention has, also, for object a detecting method of
      the presence of a substance corresponding one to the one of the
      two elements of a couple ligand/receptor in an analytic,
      characterized sample in what it includes/understands the
      implementation of a method of amplification such as defined
      herebefore.<br>
      <br>
      According to a first mode of implementation particularly prefered
      of this detecting method, this one includes/understands:<br>
      put it in contact of two reagents respectively containing the
      ligand and the receptor, under conditions suitable to allow their
      reaction, previously, simultaneously or subsequently to this
      setting in contact, the application, with the one and/or the other
      of these reagents, of the electromagnetic signal characteristic of
      the biological activity of the analytic sample, and<br>
      it detection and/or the measuring of the complex formed
      ligands-receptors during the reaction enters the two reagents.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, obtaining of an amplification of the formation of complex
      ligands-receptors between two reagents compared to a " pilot "
      reaction (such as previously defined) translated the presence, in
      the electromagnetic signal of the biological activity of the test
      sample, the electromagnetic signal characteristic of the
      biological activity of sought substance and, by way of
      consequence, translated the presence, in this sample, of sought
      substance.<br>
      <br>
      If such an amplification is obtained and where the analytic sample
      is capable to not contain only one of the two elements of the
      couple ligand/receptor, but these two elements, the presence, in
      this sample, of sought substance can be confirmed by the comparing
      of the results obtained with:<br>
      <br>
      - is those observed for a reaction led in reactional conditions
      Mrs. but with an application at the same time of the
      electromagnetic signal characteristic of the biological activity
      of the test sample and electromagnetic signal characteristic of
      the biological activity of the ligand,<br>
      <br>
      - is those observed for a reaction led in reactional conditions
      Mrs. but with an application at the same time of the
      electromagnetic signal characteristic of the biological activity
      of the test sample and characteristic signal of the biological
      activity of the receptor.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, if the simultaneous application of the electromagnetic
      signal characteristic of the biological activity of the analytic
      sample and the electromagnetic signal characteristic of the
      biological activity of the ligand results in an amplification of
      the formation of the complex ligands-receptors compared to the
      application of the single electromagnetic signal characteristic of
      the biological activity of the aforesaid analytic sample, then
      that means that this sample does not contain a ligand and thus
      only the receptor contains. The absence of increase of the
      formation of the complex ligands-receptors signing, it, the
      presence of the ligand in the analytic sample.<br>
      <br>
      Of similar manner, if the simultaneous application of the
      electromagnetic signal characteristic of the biological activity
      of the analytic sample and electromagnetic signal characteristic
      of the biological activity of the receptor results in an
      amplification of the formation of the complex ligands-receptors
      compared to the application of the single electromagnetic signal
      characteristic of the biological activity of the aforesaid
      analytic sample, then it can in tre deduces that this sample does
      not contain a receptor and thus only the ligand contains. The
      absence of increase of the formation of the complex
      ligands-receptors signing, it, the presence of the receptor in the
      sample.<br>
      <br>
      In order to avoid obtaining wrongfully negative results, i.e.
      results which would not make it possible to reveal an effect of
      amplification of the application of the electromagnetic signal
      characteristic of the activity of the analytic sample and this,
      although this last contains actually sought substance, the
      concentrations of the ligand and the receptor put to react are
      advantageously selected so as to tre sufficient lead to the
      obtaining of complex the detectable in the absence of the
      application of the electromagnetic signal characteristic of
      biological activity of the aforesaid sample, but low
      ligands-receptors with the concentrations capable to lead to a
      saturation of the reaction between this ligand and this receptor.<br>
      <br>
      According to a second mode of implementation prefered of this
      detecting method, this one understands: put it in contact of the
      analytic sample with a reagent containing is the receptor, if the
      sought substance in the sample is the ligand, that is to say the
      ligand, if the sought substance in the sample is the receptor,
      under conditions suitable to allow their reaction, previously,
      simultaneously or subsequently to this setting in contact, the
      application, with this sample and/or this reagent, of the
      electromagnetic signal characteristic of the biological activity
      of the ligand and/or the receptor, and it detection and/or the
      measuring of the complex optionally formed ligands-receptors, in
      which case, the obtaining of complex ligands-receptors translates
      the presence of sought substance in the analytic sample.<br>
      <br>
      This second mode of present implementation prefered a very
      particular intért to detect the substance in a sample presence,
      which one knows that they are not detectable or that very
      sparingly by the other available detection methods, because of
      what these substances are generally present with very low
      concentrations, even with the state of traces.<br>
      <br>
      The detecting method of the presence of an analytic substance in a
      sample conforms to the present Invention of numerous advantages.<br>
      <br>
      Indeed, on the one hand, it makes it possible to detect the
      presence of a sought substance with a very large sensitivity and
      an high specificity. So in the case, for example, of a
      bacteriological analysis, it makes it possible to remove the need
      to insulate the different germs, to cultivate them, proceed to a
      antibiogramme and to identify these germs by their biochemical,
      morphologic and immunologic characters, and authorizes the
      obtaining of results much rapidly than the immunologic detection
      methods currently used in bacteriology.<br>
      <br>
      In addition, insofar as it is enough to have a sample to the size
      of a drop to acquire and record the electromagnetic signal
      characteristic of the biological activity of this sample and
      where, this signal, once recorded can be restored with the
      application, this method offer the possibility carry out analyses
      as many as one wishes starting from a microsample.<br>
      <br>
      Lastly, 1 ' recording of an electromagnetic signal which can tre
      preserved indefinitely, for example in the shape of a capable
      computerized file of tre preserved on a single diskette or a
      CD-Rom, and of tre transmitted of a place to another by any
      transmission means the given digital ones, this method makes it
      possible, moreover, to remove all constrained conservation, of
      forwarding and transport of the taking away which present the
      methods currently used for detection of a substance.<br>
      <br>
      This method capable of being used to detect any substance capable
      to bind specifically with another substance and to react with it,
      being understood that the term " substance " such as it is used
      here, a biological compound, a chemical compound indicates as
      well, a cell that a microorganism of the type bacterium, virus or
      mushroom, knowing especially that for any hapten, protein or
      complex proteinaceous, it is possible to find on the market or to
      make manufacture the corresponding antibodies. For this reason,
      this method finds, especially, application in the biological
      diagnosis, that it is in human or veterinary medicine, or for the
      electromagnetic control characteristic of the biological activity
      of a substance corresponding one to the one of the two elements of
      a couple ligand/receptor, which method is characterized in what it
      includes the implementation of a method of amplification such as
      defined herebefore.<br>
      <br>
      According to a mode of implementation prefered of this detecting
      method, the electromagnetic signal to be tested is the radiated
      electromagnetic signal by a source of electromagnetic radiation.<br>
      <br>
      The Invention has, also, for object a detecting apparatus of the
      presence of a substance corresponding one to the one of the two
      elements of a couple ligand/receptor in an analytic sample, which
      apparatus is characterized in what it in accordance with the
      invention implements a method and in what it comprises:<br>
      <br>
      a) receiving means of the analytic sample and a reagent containing
      either the receptor, or the ligand, allowing their setting in
      contact under conditions suitable to allow their reaction;<br>
      <br>
      b) an electromagnetic signal source characteristic of the activity
      of the ligand and/or receptor;<br>
      <br>
      c) application means of the signal delivered by the aforementioned
      electromagnetic signal source with the sample and/or the reagent;
      and<br>
      <br>
      d) detection means and/or of measuring of the complex formed
      ligands-receptors during the reaction enters the sample and the
      reagent.<br>

      In Figures 1 to 5 and 10, one used references Mrs. to designate
      elements Mrs.<br>
      <br>
      In addition, each image of Figures 6 to 9 corresponds to a surface
      of approximately 2 mms X 1,5 mms of the support on which the
      agglutination reactions were carried out.<br>
      <br>
      It owes of course, however, that these examples are given only as
      illustrations of the object of the Invention and do not constitute
      in any manner a limitation of it.<br>
      <br>
      One refers first of all on Figures 1 to 5.<br>
      <br>
      On Figure 1, one schematically represented a first example of
      performing of an apparatus of acquisition of the electromagnetic
      signal characteristic of the biological activity of a substance 1
      laid out in a container 3, for example a test tube. A sensor 5,
      typically a coil of type " telephonic sensor " marketed for tre
      applied on an earphone telephonic and connected to a tape
      recorder, is applied against container 3. Container 3 can tre also
      consisted a biological wall, especially the skin of a living tre.<br>
      <br>
      In such a case, the acquisition of the electromagnetic signal is
      carried out of noninvasive manner.<br>
      <br>
      The signal collected by coil 5, advantageously, is amplified by an
      amplifier 7 and is available with an output terminal 9. Without
      that present any restrictive character of 1 ' illustrated example,
      a first end of coil 5 being connected to the input of
      amplifier-preamplifier 7, the opposite end being connected to a
      mass 11. In an example of performing, coil 5 is a telephonic
      sensor of the trade having a length of 6 mms, an internal diameter
      of 6 mms containing a metal core, an outer diameter of 16 mm and
      an impedance of 300 Q.<br>
      <br>
      On Figure 2, one accounted for 1 schematically ' prefered example
      of performing of an apparatus of acquisition of the
      electromagnetic signal characteristic of the biological activity
      of a substance 1 contained in a container 3, in which the
      apparatus includes/understands, preferably, in an enclosure 13
      provided with an electrical shield and magnetic, a transducer 15
      of irradiation of the aforesaid substance 1 supplied with a
      generator 17. Transducer 15 comprises, for example, a coil,
      advantageously supplemented by guides of waves, for example, an
      air-gap (not represented) placed in contact with the outer walls
      of container 3.<br>
      <br>
      Generator 17 generates a sinusoidal signal low frequency, signals
      square low frequency, pink noise or, advantageously, white noise.
      The signal spectrum of excitation feeding coil 15 corresponds
      substantially to the spectrum of the audible frequencies (20 Hz-20
      000 Hz). Generator 17 can tre a generator of analogue signal of
      known type or, for example, a read-only memory (ROM, PROM, EPROM,
      EEPROM in Anglo-Saxon terminology) containing the digital signal
      of the desired noise and which is connected to a converter
      numeriqueanalogic, or the outputted line of a card sounds of a
      microcomputer multimedia.<br>
      <br>
      However, the implementation of upper frequencies does not leave
      the frame of the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      The sensor of acquisition 5 can comprise a like coil with coil 5
      of the apparatus of Figure 1 or, advantageously, a coil of small
      diameter connected by a guide of electromagnetic waves to the wall
      of container 3.<br>
      <br>
      Advantageously, the signal collected by sensor 5 is available with
      an output terminal 9 of a amplifier-preamplifier 7.<br>
      <br>
      The available signal on terminal 9 can tre directly applied with
      or substances to be irradiated, especially with the ligand, the
      receptor or the couple ligand/receptor (especially using the
      apparatus illustrated on Figure 5 and described ciaprès).<br>
      <br>
      The recording of the signal can tre carried out into analogue by a
      recorder of signal 19 (Figure 3), especially on magnetic tape 21
      adapt with the frequencies of the collected signal. For the
      acoustic frequencies, one can especially use a tape recorder.
      Output terminal 9 of the apparatus of signal acquisition of<br>
      Figures 1 or 2 is connected to the input microphone or the input
      line of such a tape recorder. During the reading, the signal is
      collected with an output terminal 9 ', especially with the
      outputted line or outputted the loudspeaker of tape recorder 19.<br>
      <br>
      Advantageously, one carries out a digital recording after
      analog-to-digital conversion of the signal. One uses, for example,
      a microcomputer 23 illustrated on Figure 4, provided with a card
      of signal acquisition 25. It is for example about a computer of
      type PC, rotating under operating system WINDOWSX 95 of Company
      MICROSOFT and comprising, in addition to the card of acquisition
      25, a microprocessor 27, an interface of input/output 29, a
      controller 31 of a mass memory 33 and one interface video 35
      connected by one or more bus 37. The card of acquisition 25
      comprises an analogue converter 39 having, preferably, an upper
      resolution with 10 bits, for example equal with 12 bits, as well
      as a frequency of double sampling of the maximum frequency which
      one wants to be able to digitize for the signal processing. In the
      acoustic frequencies, the frequency of sampling is advantageously
      substantially equal to 44 Khz. For the processing of these signal
      types, one advantageously uses a card its for microcomputer, for
      example the card Soundblaster 16 or the card Soundblaster 32 sold
      by CREATIVE Company LABS. The computer 23 provided with the card
      of acquisition of playback 25, especially of a card Soundblaster
      32 can advantageously replace the generator of signal 17 of Figure
      2.<br>
      <br>
      One connects outputted the 9 of the apparatuses of signal
      acquisition of Figures 1 with input 9 of the analog-to-digital
      converter 39 of card 25 of the computer 23; one proceeds to an
      acquisition of the pendent signal one duration for example ranging
      between 1 and 60 S and one record the digital file in a mass
      memory 33, for example in the shape of a file its to the format.
      WAV. This file can optionally undergo a digital processing, such
      as for example a digital amplification for calibration of the
      signal level, a filtering for the removing of nondesired
      frequencies, or tre transformed into its spectrum by a transform
      of FOURIER discrete, preferably by the algorithm of rapid
      transform of FOURIER (FTT in Anglo-Saxon terminology).<br>
      <br>
      The time of sound reproduction can tre increased while repeating
      in a file several times a fragment or the whole of the file its
      original.<br>
      <br>
      On order, the optionally treated file is transformed by a
      digital-to-analog converter 41 of the card 25 (or of a separate
      card), which delivers on outputted the 9 ' the analogue
      electromagnetic signal characteristic of the biological activity
      to be applied, according to the method of amplification in
      conformity with the Invention, for example to aliquot 43 of a
      first reagent and to aliquot 45 of a second reagent, as
      illustrated on Figure 5.<br>
      <br>
      Advantageously, the application of the signal with these aliquot
      is carried out previously with their mixture. The support on which
      these aliquot are deposited, for example, a blade 47 provided with
      capillary 49 in the shape of serpentine, is laid out in a radiated
      electromagnetic field by a transducer 51, typically a coil whose
      first end 9,9 ' is connected to outputted the 9 of an apparatus of
      acquisition of<br>
      <br>
      Figures 1 or 2 or to outputted the 9 ' of an apparatus of
      recording of Figures 3 or 4.<br>
      <br>
      The end of the coil opposed to connecting terminal 9,9 ', for
      example, is connected to mass 11.<br>
      <br>
      Without that representing any restrictive character, transducer 51
      comprises a coil advantageously, of horizontal axis allowing the
      introduction of blade 47. The coil has, for example, a length of
      120 mms, an internal diameter of 25 mms, an outer diameter of 28
      mms, present 631 revolutions of a wire of diameter 0,5mm and a
      resistance of 4,7 Q.<br>
      <br>
      Advantageously, the applied electrical signal on this coil 51 will
      have an amplitude of 2 effective volts.<br>
      <br>
      EXAMPLE 1: AMPLIFICATION OF the FORMATION Of AGGLUTINATS BETWEEN
      ANTIGEN POLYSACCHARIDIQUE Of ESCHERICHIA Kl COLI AND AN ANTIBODY
      DIRECTS AGAINST THIS ANTIGEN<br>
      <br>
      The method of amplification in conformity with the Invention was
      validated by testing the effects, on an agglutination reaction
      between the antigen polysaccharidic of Escherichia coli Kl and an
      antibody directed against this antigen:<br>
      <br>
      - of the application of the electromagnetic signal characteristic
      of the biological activity of a foreign antigenic substance to
      this reaction such as Streptococcus,<br>
      <br>
      - of the application of the electromagnetic signal characteristic
      of the biological activity of Escherichia coli,<br>
      <br>
      - of the simultaneous application of the electromagnetic signal
      characteristic of the biological activity of Streptococcus and the
      electromagnetic signal characteristic of the biological activity
      of an antibody directed against Escherichia coli, and finally<br>
      <br>
      - of the simultaneous application of the electromagnetic signal
      characteristic of the biological activity of Escherichia coli and
      the electromagnetic signal characteristic of the biological
      activity of an antibody directed against this antigen.<br>
      <br>
      1) Performing of the tests: a) Acquisition of the electromagnetic
      signals:<br>
      <br>
      The acquisition of the electromagnetic signals characteristics of
      the biological activities of Streptococcus, Escherichia coli and
      its specific antibody was carried out by means of the hardware of
      recording of Figure 2.<br>
      <br>
      The acquisition of the electromagnetic signal characteristic of
      the biological activity of Streptococcus was carried out while
      placing at the center of 1 ' enclosure a 13 tube containing 1 ml
      of an aqueous suspension of previously formolized Streptococcus
      bacteria (6.106 bactéries/ml).<br>
      <br>
      The acquisition of the electromagnetic signals characteristics of
      the biological activity of Escherichia coli and its specific
      antibody was carried out into operative of Mrs. manner, but while
      using respectively:<br>
      <br>
      - a tube containing 1 ml of an aqueous suspension of bacteria<br>
      Escherichia coli previously formolized (6.106bactéries/ml); and<br>
      <br>
      - a tube containing 1 ml of a particle suspension of a latex
      sensitized by a specific monoclonal antibody of mouse of
      Escherichia Kl coli, coming from a kit PASTOREXs MENINGITIS
      (Reference 61709-SANOFI DIAGNOSES PASTEUR). b) Preparation of
      reagents of the agglutination reaction:<br>
      <br>
      The tests were carried out while using as reagents:<br>
      - of an hand, a prepared antigen solution polysaccharidic of
      Escherichia K1 coli by dissolution of an antigenic extract coming
      from a kit PASTOREXX MENINGITIS (Reference 61709-SANOFI<br>
      DIAGNOSES PASTEUR) in 1 ml of water distilled and sterile, then
      dilution to the 1/7, 1/7,5 or 1/8 in physiological serum; and<br>
      - of another hand, the latex sensitized by a specific monoclonal
      antibody of mouse of the antibody of Escherichia present K1 coli
      in this Mrs. kit, after dilution to the 1/3 in physiological
      serum. c) Application of the electromagnetic signals with the
      agglutination reaction:<br>
      For each test, one used the following protocol:<br>
      one place in a drying oven heated at 37 C a transducer consisted a
      coil measuring 120 mms of long and 25 mms internal diameter,
      presenting 631 revolutions and a resistance of 4,7 Q, and
      connected to outputted the 9 ' of the digital-to-analog converter
      41 of a Soundblaster card of a computer 23 restoring the files of
      recording consisted the electromagnetic signals which one wishes
      to apply, time necessary to bring this transducer to the
      temperature of 37 C;<br>
      one deposits on a blade provided with capillary in the shape of
      serpentine (of type of those supplied in kits PASTOREX
      MENINGITIS), at low distance from the opening of this last, a drop
      (either 40 to 50 J. l) antigenic solution as described at the
      foregoing point b), as well as a drop (corresponding one also with
      a volume from 40 to 50, ul) of latex sensitized by the antibody,
      by taking guard so that these drops do not mix;<br>
      one applique, with the two drops of reagents thus deposited, the
      electromagnetic signals wished while placing the blade at the
      center of the pendent transducer approximately 2 mn and by
      restoring a file its using the computer 23 of<br>
      Figure 4;<br>
      one mixture the two reagent drops pendent approximately 10 seconds
      and one lets pendent approximately 13 minutes in the drying oven
      the reaction mixture migrate in the capillary one and the
      agglutination reaction to occur;<br>
      one then leaves the blade the drying oven and one carries out a
      reading of this agglutination.<br>
      <br>
      Like visible on Figure 10, this reading is carried out by
      analysis, by means of a software of analysis and image processing
      implemented on a computer of rotating type PC 23 ' under operating
      system VJNDOWSO 95 (MICROSOFT), of an acquired image using a video
      camera 53 positioned on an optical microscope 55 and connected to
      that the computer by a card of acquisition video 57. Camera 53
      works in grey levels. A first processing increasing contrast, the
      threshold being controlled so that the agglutinats appear into
      black, while the zones deprived of latex particles or agglutinats
      appear into white.<br>
      <br>
      From the analysis of the two-dimensional spatial distribution of
      the dark areas of the image, the computer determines an index of
      agglutination (I) calculated according to the formula:<br>
      Surface occupied by the agglutinats of upper size to 60 pixels<br>
      Surface occupied by the agglutinats of equal or low size to 60
      pixels<br>
      This index of agglutination is all the more high as the size of
      the formed agglutinats during the agglutination reaction is more
      substantial.<br>
      <br>
      The amplification is regarded as positive when, during an
      experiment, the application of the electromagnetic signals
      characteristics of the biological activity of Escherichia coli
      and/or biological activity of its specific antibody led to the
      obtaining of at least upper indices of agglutination of 40% to the
      maximum index of agglutination obtained, in conditions Mrs., and
      on for example 3 experiments, after application of the
      electromagnetic signal characteristic of the biological activity
      of Streptococcus.<br>
      <br>
      2) Results:<br>
      Table 1 hereafter present indices of agglutination (I) obtained in
      first series of tests aiming at comparing the effects of the
      application of the electromagnetic signal characteristic of the
      biological activity of Escherichia coli with those observed after
      application, in reactional conditions Mrs., from the
      electromagnetic signal characteristic of the biological activity
      of Streptococcus, and this, for 3 different dilutions (1/7,1/7,5
      and 1/8) of the polysaccharidic antigen solution of Escherichia K1
      coli used like reagent in the agglutination reactions.<br>
      <br>
      TABLE 1<br>
      <br>
      In addition, Figures 6 and 7 show, as examples, of the images of
      the formed agglutinats on the one hand, after application of the
      electromagnetic signal characteristic of the biological activity
      of Streptococcus (Figure 6) and, on the other hand, after
      application of the electromagnetic signal characteristic of the
      biological activity of Escherichia coli (Figure 7). These images
      correspond respectively to the indices of agglutination of 32 and
      117 which are brought back to the 5th line of results of Table 1.<br>
      <br>
      Table 2 below present, as for him, the indices of agglutination
      (I) obtained in a second series of experiments in the frame of
      which effects of the simultaneous application of the
      electromagnetic signal characteristic of the biological activity
      of Escherichia coli and the electromagnetic signal characteristic
      of the biological activity of the antibody directed against<br>
      Escherichia coli, were compared with those of the simultaneous
      application, in reactional conditions Mrs., of the electromagnetic
      signal characteristic of the biological activity of Streptococcus
      and the electromagnetic signal characteristic of the biological
      activity of the antibody directed against Escherichia coli and
      this, for 2 different dilutions (1/7 and 1/7,5) of the
      polysaccharidic antigen solution of Escherichia coli<br>
      K1 used as reagent.<br>
      <br>
      TABLE 2<br>
      Figures 8 and 9 show, also as examples, of the images of the
      agglutinats which corresponding respectively with the indices of
      agglutination of 71 and 247 brought back to the 2nd line of
      results of Table 2.<br>
      <br>
      All these results clearly put in evidence the ability that present
      the electromagnetic signal characteristic of the biological
      activity of an element of a couple ligand/receptor, to amplify the
      formation of complex formed by the reaction between this ligand
      and this receptor and this, of very specific manner, since the
      electromagnetic signal characteristic of the biological activity
      of a biologically active, but foreign element with this reaction
      product, him, not of effect of amplification.<br>
      <br>
      They show also that this amplification is all the more marked as
      one applique, with the two elements of the couple ligand/receptor,
      at the same time the electromagnetic signal characteristic of the
      biological activity of this ligand and the electromagnetic signal
      characteristic of the biological activity of this receptor.<br>

      EXAMPLE 2: DETECTION OF the PRESENCE Of ESCHERICHIA COLI<br>
      IN A SAMPLE<br>
      The intért of the use of the method of amplification conforms to
      the Invention for the detection of a present substance in an
      analytic sample was checked by carrying out a series of tests
      aiming at comparing the effects of the application, on an
      agglutination reaction between the antigen polysaccharidic of
      Escherichia K1 coli and a monoclonal antibody of specific mouse of
      this antigen identical with that implemented in 1 ' example 1
      herebefore, of the electromagnetic signal collected starting from
      a sample of a food product, in the species an apple compote,
      previously contaminated by bacteria Escherichia coli, with those
      obtained at the time of the application, in reactional conditions
      Mrs., of the collected electromagnetic signal starting from a
      control sample, i.e. not contaminated, of Mrs. food product.<br>
      <br>
      1) Performing of the tests:<br>
      The acquisition of the electromagnetic signals of the apple
      compote samples (contaminated control samples and samples) was
      carried out by means of the hardware of recording of Figure 2,
      while placing at the center of 1 ' enclosure 13:<br>
      - in the case of the control samples, a tube containing 1 ml of
      compote previously diluted to the 1/2 with physiological serum,
      and<br>
      - in the case of the contaminated samples, a tube containing 1 ml
      of compote previously diluted to the 1/2 with physiological serum
      and contaminated, by adding of bacteria previously formolized
      Escherichia coli, at a rate of 3.106 bacteria per ml of diluted
      compote.<br>
      <br>
      The tests were carried out while using as reagents:<br>
      - of an hand, a suspension containing of the bacteria Escherichia
      coli previously formolized in physiological serum, at a rate of<br>
      10 ' bactéries/ml, and<br>
      - of another hand, the latex sensitized by a specific monoclonal
      antibody of mouse of the antibody of Escherichia present K1 coli
      in this Mrs. kit, after dilution to the 1/3 in physiological
      serum, and into following an operational protocol identical with
      that described with the paragraph c) of 1 ' example 1 herebefore.<br>
      <br>
      2) Results:<br>
      The Table 3 hereafter present indices of agglutination (I)
      obtained in three series of tests.<br>
      <br>
      TABLE 3<br>
      Like visible on Table 3, the size of the formed agglutinats during
      the reaction between the antigen polysaccharidic of Escherichia Kl
      coli and its specific antibody is substantially higher if the
      applied electromagnetic signal during this reaction were collected
      starting from an apple compote sample contaminated by bacteria
      Escherichia coli.<br>
      <br>
      These results show that the method of amplification conforms to
      the Invention can tre advantageously used to detect the presence,
      in an analytic sample, of a biologically active susbtance such as
      a bacterium, Mrs. when this sample present a complex composition,
      i.e. it contains, as in the case of the apple compote samples, of
      numerous others susbstances biologically active.<br>
      <br>
      As that spring by what precedes, the Invention is limited by no
      means to the forms of performing which come from tre described in
      a more explicit way; it embraces of them on the contrary all the
      variants which can come to mind from the technician in the matter,
      without deviating from the frame, nor of the span of the present
      one<br>

      <br>
      The invention concerns a method for activating an inactive
      solution with very low concentration of a specific biological
      and/or chemical substance. The method comprises a step which
      consists in subjecting said solution to a mechanical excitation
      field, in particular generated by a vortex.<br>
      <br>
      Present invention relates to a process of activation of an
      inactive solution and to very low concentration of a biological
      and/or chemical determined substance in a solvent. Present
      invention relates to also applications of the aforesaid process of
      activation.<br>
      <br>
      One indicates under the term of " very low concentration ", of the
      concentrations ranging between 10 - 6 and zero moles per liter
      (M).<br>
      <br>
      One knows methods of preparation of solution " highly diluted " by
      dilution and successive agitation. One of the methods of
      preparation employed traditionally in homeopathy (method of
      Hannemahn) consists, starting from a relatively concentrated
      solution carried out using a dyeing parent (of great concentration
      with 10 - 6 M), to carry out a dilution of a factor 10 or 100,
      then with a mechanical agitation (refer " dynamization "). Each
      operation after is noted that the solution remained active in the
      sense that it starts a reaction within a sensitive biological
      system.<br>
      <br>
      As examples of solutions which were prepared by the described
      method cidessus, one can quote all the homeopathic preparations.
      As sensitive examples of biological systems allowing to test the
      active character such solutions one can quote: the isolated heart
      of guinea-pig (experiment of Langendorff) or the cutaneous test
      carried out on the skin of a guinea-pig or a living rabbit.<br>
      <br>
      The need to start from an active solution before carrying out a
      dilution then with an agitation appeared impossible to circumvent
      to obtain active diluted solutions. The dilutions carried out up
      to 10 - 6 M and beyond that, without implementing this process of
      successive agitation and dilution, did not allow until present
      obtaining active solutions. L is not without interest to recall
      either that technical agitation and of dilution bringing in work
      by Hannemann was extrapolated without one being able until present
      showing the vertues such high dilutions beyond factor 5 CH.<br>
      <br>
      Gold the inventors, who are known for their workings on high
      dilutions (Nature 1988: “Dégranulation of Basophilic human started
      by a solution with high dilution of anti-IgE antibody”), noted of
      surprising manner that it was of possible to obtain an active
      solution starting from an inactive solution and with very low
      concentration of a biological and/or chemical determined substance
      in a solvent. They showed that a solution with very low
      concentration whose activity is non-existent at the beginning, can
      be made active by processes particularly single to implement.
      Thus, they conceived a process which makes it possible to make
      active of the solutions to very low concentration without it being
      necessary to previously prepare them by technical traditional
      successive dilutions and agitations.<br>
      <br>
      They have thus resolved a problem whose industrial implications
      are considerable. Indeed:<br>
      <br>
      - it is from now on possible to detect biological and/or chemical
      determined substances in solution with very low concentration in a
      solvent,<br>
      <br>
      - it is from now on possible to design and carry out medicaments
      implementing biological and/or chemical determined substances in
      solution at very low concentration in a solvent,<br>
      <br>
      - it is from now on possible to control the production of products
      with very low concentration especially of the homeopathic
      products.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention thus has as an object a process to activate
      a solution with very low concentration of a biological and/or
      chemical determined substance in a solvent. The aforementioned
      process includes/understands the step to place the aforementioned
      solution in a mechanical excitation field. The mechanical
      excitation field could be created, for example, by one shock wave
      being propagated in the solution, by ultrasounds or sound waves
      diffused in the solution, by vibrations transmitted by the
      container containing the solution. Preferably, the mechanical
      excitation field results from an agitation forces especially
      obtained by means of a stirrer of Vortex type made up of a disc
      which turns rapidly until a vortex is formed in the liquid column
      in the course of agitation. Preferably, the aforementioned
      solution is subjected to a pendent mechanical excitation field at
      least 15 seconds.<br>
      <br>
      As examples of substances in solution which were activated by the
      method described above, one can quote: arnica, ovalbumin,
      acetylcholine, the calcium ionophore.<br>
      <br>
      The process in accordance with the invention present of interest
      only when the concentration of the aforesaid determined substance
      in the aforementioned solution is low to 10-6 moles per liter.
      Indeed with the top of 10-6 moles per liter the solution is
      already active (traditional pharmacology). Preferably, the
      concentration of the aforesaid determined substance in the
      aforementioned solution is included/understood in a low with 10-6
      moles per liter and great fork with<br>
      10-l6 moles per liter.<br>
      <br>
      Preferably also the aforementioned solvent contains at least water
      5%. It indeed appeared that in on this side certain proportion of
      water in solvent the solution subjected to a mechanical excitation
      field residue inactive.<br>
      <br>
      It also appeared that an alcohol percentage from at least 2% in
      the solvent causes that the solution pendent residue active a
      longer period.<br>
      <br>
      The process in accordance with the invention includes/understands
      moreover the step to control the active state of the aforesaid the
      solution by implementing an experimental protocol identical or
      similar with that which one would implement to account for the
      presence of the aforesaid determined substance in a medium which
      would contain it.<br>
      <br>
      As sensitive example of biological system allowing to test the
      active character of the solutions of following determined
      substances: calcium-ionophore, acetylcholine, histamine, ovalbumin
      (in the animal made sensitive), arnica, bradykinin, anti-IgE
      antibody, one can quote: the experiment of Langendorff (heart of
      isolated guinea-pig) as well as the cutaneous test carried out on
      a skin of guinea-pig or living rabbit. Thus for example, to
      control the active state of the acetylcholine solution it is
      checked that an injection of this one, under the skin of a
      guinea-pig especially, causes cutaneous reactions.<br>
      <br>
      Present invention relates to also the application of the process
      with the detection of a determined substance, diluted in very low
      concentration.<br>
      <br>
      Indeed since the solution is activated, it is possible to proceed
      to tests of identification by implementing an experimental
      protocol identical or similar with that which one would implement
      to account for the presence of the aforesaid determined substance
      in a medium which would contain it. As example of determined
      substances that one can detect in solution, one can quote
      following substances: calciumionophore, caffeine, nicotine, toxins
      and endotoxines bacterial; and following tests of identification:
      the experiment of Langendorff (heart of isolated guinea-pig) as
      well as the cutaneous test carried out on a skin of guinea-pig or
      living rabbit.<br>
      <br>
      Present invention relates to also the application of the process
      with the production of medicaments implementing biological
      materials and/or chemical at very low concentration. Indeed, since
      it is possible to prepare active solutions with very low
      biological and/or chemical determined substance concentration, new
      therapeutic applications of these substances become possible.<br>
      <br>
      As example of medicaments which one can thus produce, one can
      quote the following medicaments: coronary vasodilators (ex:
      trinitroglycérinej, bétabloquant (propranolol), caffeine,
      nicotine.<br>
      <br>
      Present invention relates to also the application of the process
      with the control of the production of products with very low
      concentration, especially of the homeopathic products. Indeed, one
      of the problems to be solved when homeopathic products are
      manufactured is that of control in production of successive
      dilutions. The process in accordance with the invention makes it
      possible to test the activity of the homeopathic products at the
      time of the different phases of their manufacturing process. As
      example of homeopathic products which one can thus control the
      production one can quote the following medicaments: arnica 5 to 30
      CH, histaminum 5 to 30 CH, acétylcolinum 5 to 30 CH, apis
      mellifica 5 to 30 CH.<br>
      <br>
      Other characteristics and benefits of the invention will appear
      with the reading of the description of variants of performing of
      the invention, given as indicative and nonrestrictive example,
      like with the reading of the examples of experiments having made
      it possible to validate the process of activation, object of the
      present invention, and which refer to the drawings annexed in
      which: - <br>

      <br>
      One now will describe figure 1 which represents a perspective view
      of a variant of performing of the system of agitation. A rubber 2
      roller is mounted pivotal around a vertical axis. The rubber
      roller is put in rotation around the vertical axis by an electric
      motor (not represented), located inside case 3. The electric motor
      is supplied by a cable 10. The rotational speed of the roller is
      controlled by a potentiometer 4.<br>
      <br>
      Tube 1 contains solution 6 of acetylcholine to the concentration
      of lpM, having to be agitated violently. Operator 5 maintains the
      end low 7 of the tube applied against roller 2 while supporting on
      upper part 8 of tube 1. The low end 7 of tube 1 described a circle
      9. It results from it that a vortex product within solution 6.
      This vortex agitates and mixture violently the solution.<br>
      <br>
      As example, one now will describe by referring on figure 2 the
      test realized starting from a heart of isolated guinea-pig
      perfusé, known since 1897 (under the name of 1 ' Experiment of
      Langendorff) and described in the books of traditional
      pharmacology, especially in The animal experimentation in
      cardiology - Medicine - Science Inserm - Flammarion, Bernard
      SWYNGHEDAUW, Chapter 3.1 P. 81 Isolated body: isolated heart
      according to Langendorff. The collecting one of collecting
      fraction tubes at a rate of a tube per minute and measurement thus
      flow of the heart of guinea-pig minute per minute.<br>
      <br>
      Here results coming from the experiments carried out with
      following substances, after they vortexées (agitated) like it was
      described while referring on figure 1, in a tube of 15 ml
      containing 10 ml of solution: - for the first, a mixture of
      acetate-choline (AC) lpM (sodium acetate 1 pM + choline 1 chloride
      pM) vortexée pendent 15 seconds, - for the second, of the
      acetylcholine (ACh) pendent IpM vortexée 15 seconds, - for the
      third, of the acetylcholine (ACh) 1pM vortexée pendent 5 seconds -
      for the third, of the acetylcholine (ACh) 1pM vortexée pendent 2
      seconds - for the third, of the acetylcholine (ACh) 1pM vortexée
      pendent 1 seconds<br>
      <br>
      The buffer solution had the following composition: Ca 2+ 2mM,
      NaHC03 25 mms.<br>
      <br>
      The solvent employed in the five cases was water.<br>
      <br>
      The table hereafter indicates (in ml) the amount of buffer
      solution recovered in the header tubes in the course of time.<br>
      <br>
      This table puts in evidence several things: a) in the experimental
      protocol the solutions are tested before being vortexées in order
      to check that they are inactive. The results of experiment 5
      illustrate one of these tests. The solution is else inactive
      before being vortexée. Indeed variation of flow of 0, 2ml/min
      (min=3,6; max=3,8) corresponds to uncertainties of measurement and
      the normal variations of flow of the biological system which is
      the heart of perfusé isolated guinea-pig. b) the comparing of the
      results of experiment 1 with the experiment 2 watch which the
      action to agitate is not sufficient in itself: still it is
      necessary that molecules to which the biological system is
      sensitive are present. Indeed a very adjacent product of
      acetylcholine, acetate-choline, prepared in the same conditions
      which the acetylcholine, does not start of reaction (Exp 1). c)
      the series of experiments 2,3, and 4 was carried out on the same
      heart of guinea-pig and watch the influence of the time of
      agitation using the Vortex on the activity produced in substance.
      Thus for a 2 seconds agitation one obtains a maximum variation of
      flow of 0,3 ml/min (min=3,5; max=3, 8) whereas for a 15 seconds
      agitation one obtains a maximum variation of flow of 0,6 ml/min
      (min=2, 8; max=3, 4)<br>
      <br>
      As other examples here results coming from the experiments carried
      out with like substance of the acetylcholine lpM, vortexée 15
      seconds for different contents ethanol in solvent. The experiments
      were carried out 9 days after the agitation of the solution.<br>
      <br>
      ***<br>
      <br>
      This table puts in evidence that the content ethanol supports the
      conservation of the activity in water.<br>
      <br>
      One now will describe by referring on figure 3 the cutaneous test
      in the guinea-pig<br>
      <br>
      We use a living guinea-pig, to which one injects by venous path a
      blue dye (blue of Evans) which fixed on blood albumin. The albumin
      does not leave the vessels, except if there is ignition, therefore
      vasodilation and permeation of the vessels, the typical example of
      such a reaction at the man being urticaria.<br>
      <br>
      The test is carried out by injecting under the skin of the animal
      thus prepared 0.1 ml of the solution of which it is advisable to
      control the activity. One measurement then the diameter of the
      blue stains appeared around the injection points. For this purpose
      one scanne skin, then the file bitmap is recorded. Then one
      measurement dimension in pixels of the blue stains due to the
      reaction.<br>
      <br>
      The numbers 3,4, 10,11 which appear in the first column of the
      table hereafter correspond to the references of figure 3.<br>
      <br>
      &lt;Tb&gt; - The injection number 3 watch that the vortexée
      solution with very low concentration (1pM) of the neurotransmitter
      acetylcholine (ACh) starts a substantial cutaneous reaction (1
      949.103 pixels) compared to the same not vortexée solution which
      does not start reaction like the watch the injection number 4 (43
      103 pixels).<br>
      <br>
      - The comparing of the injection number 3 (1 949.103 pixels) and
      of the injection number 11 (1 154.103 pixels) watch that the
      activity of a solution with very low vortexée concentration is
      very with fact comparable with that of a not vortexée solution
      with higher concentration (L, uM, usual concentration in
      traditional pharmacology) - the injection number 10 is carried out
      with a vortexée solution picomolaire (lpM) of a product near of
      acetylcholine but inactive: the mixture acetate/choline (AC). This
      injection watch that cutaneous reaction of guinea-pig is else
      specific of the nature of substance in solution bus this solution
      of acetate/choline vortexée in the same conditions that the
      present injection number 1 no effect (25 103 pixels).<br>

          style="font-weight: bold;">
      </div>
      <br>
      The invention has as an object a new process of preparation of
      homeopathic compositions starting from an initial solution
      containing an active substance.<br>
      <br>
      The invention also has as an object an automatic apparatus for the
      bringing in work of the aforementioned process.<br>
      <br>
      Until this day, the technical ones of manufacture used for the
      preparation of composition homeopathic take as a starting point
      those recommended by Hannemann and it act primarily of the
      triturate, the impregnation and dilution (for example, centesimal
      or decimal).<br>
      <br>
      The technical one of dilution makes it possible to prepare
      homeopathic dilutions which are capable to be used such as they
      are or which are embedded with one excipient neutral for the
      Galenic shaper which constitutes the finished drug.<br>
      <br>
      With regard to the technical one of manufacture by centesimal
      dilution, one can proceed in the following way<br>
      - one lays out a series of bottles and stoppers washed with water
      and dried, from of corresponding number with the number of
      centesimal dilution to obtain;<br>
      - one puts in the first bottle a part by weight of basic substance
      supplemented at 100 parts by weight in volume by means of the
      suitable carrier;<br>
      - 100 times at least are shaken; dilution obtained is the first
      CH; one takes a part by volume of this first CH and one pours in
      the second bottle containing 99 parts of the vehicle already;<br>
      - 100 times also are shaken; dilution obtained thus is the second
      CH.<br>
      <br>
      For decimal dilutions, one operates in an identical way, but
      according to the decimal series.<br>

      The step of shake previously evoked constitutes dynamization.<br>
      <br>
      This step of shake is also refer agitating or succussion, and it
      is of fundamental importance, for the obtaining of active
      homeopathic compositions.<br>
      <br>
      To date, in an industrial way, the process of preparation of
      homeopathic drugs rests on the use of two apparatuses: one is a
      conventional apparatus of dilution and the second an apparatus of
      agitating. Between each step, the solution to be diluted is
      extracted from the apparatus of dilution and is bringing in the
      apparatus of succussion, then again in the apparatus of dilution
      for the following step.<br>
      <br>
      The bringing in work of this process implies manual manipulating
      of the tubes, which constitutes a loss of time and a possibility
      of error.<br>
      <br>
      One of the appearances of the invention is to provide a process of
      preparation of homeopathic compositions in which the step of
      succussion is simplified.<br>
      <br>
      One of the appearances of the invention is to provide a process of
      preparation which can be automated by reducing the losses of time
      and the sources of error.<br>
      <br>
      One still of the appearances of the invention is to propose a
      machine wholly automated.<br>
      <br>
      The process of the invention of homeopathic preparation of
      composition starting from solutions of given dilution, themselves
      coming from an initial solution containing an active substance, in
      which the initial solution containing active substance undergoes a
      series of steps of successive dilution, the first dilution of the
      initial solution being obtained by taking away of a fraction or
      whole of the initial solution, and the mixing of this fraction or
      whole of the initial solution in a solution of dilution, which
      gives the solution of the first dilution, the second dilution of
      the initial solution being obtained by taking away of a fraction
      or whole of the solution of the first dilution, and the mixing of
      this fraction or whole of the solution of the first dilution in a
      solution of dilution, to give the solution of the second dilution
      and so on, until the solution of last dilution, each solution
      going of the solution of the first dilution to the solution of
      last dilution, constituting a solution of given dilution, is
      characterized in what one proceeds to a step of agitating of the
      solution of given dilution at least after all ten dilutions,
      preferably after all three dilutions, advantageously after each
      dilution, agitating being consisted a creating step of bubbles in
      the solution of given dilution using blowing degaz ata sufficient
      rate of agitating to create the formation ofa vortex in the
      solution of given dilution to agitate.<br>
      <br>
      By “vortex”, one indicates a vortex created in an intermediate
      solution, by gas insufflated under a sufficient pressure.<br>
      <br>
      By simplification, the expression “creation of bubbles” will be
      indicated by the term “bullage”.<br>
      <br>
      By “homeopathic compositions”, it is necessary to
      include/understand the compositions obtained starting from
      solutions of given dilution containing of active substances to
      very low amounts, even to infinitesimal amounts and compositions
      in which there is no more active substance.<br>
      <br>
      Preferably, the first dilution is carried out by taking a part of
      the initial solution, and each given dilution is carried out by
      taking a part of the solution of previous dilution.<br>
      <br>
      To fix the ideas, the homeopathic compositions coming from
      solutions of given dilution obtained by the process of the
      invention are such as active substance is low with 10-10 moles/l,
      advantageously low with 10-12 moles/l, and preferably low with
      10-14 moles/l, or do not contain any more active substance.<br>
      <br>
      In the process of the invention, one simplified the step of
      agitating by a step of bullage using gas blowing ata sufficient
      rate of agitating to create the formation of a vortex in the
      solution to be agitated.<br>
      <br>
      According to a beneficial embodiment of the process of the
      invention, the bullage is carried out after each dilution.<br>
      <br>
      According to another embodiment of the invention, some of the
      steps of agitating can be carried out manually for example while
      placing the container containing the solution to be agitated on an
      apparatus with agitating by eccentric.<br>
      <br>
      One after can for example the first dilution, to manually agitate
      the solution of the first dilution like indicated above, then to
      use the bullage, in accordance with the invention.<br>
      <br>
      The insufflated gas can be consisted nitrogen, advantageously by
      air.<br>
      <br>
      To create the formation of a vortex in the solution to be agitated
      via the bullage, the responsible gas of the agitating can be
      insufflated with a pressure from approximately 5 with
      approximately 6 bars.<br>
      <br>
      According to an embodiment prefered of the process of the
      invention, the appropriate rate of agitating is obtained by
      blowing of air of an active volume of approximately of the third
      to approximately once the volume of the solution to be agitated,
      the insufflated volume of air being advantageously a volume from
      approximately 100 1 to approximately 10 ml, particularly 500A1,
      under a sufficient pressure, and such as the temperature
      approximately 45 " C do not exceed.<br>
      <br>
      According to another embodiment of the process of the invention,
      one carries out, between two successive dilutions, a rinsing step
      of the apparatus which allows the taking away of a fraction of the
      whole of the initial solution and each intermediate solution and
      the mixing of this fraction or whole in a solution of dilution.<br>
      <br>
      The rinsing step between two successive dilutions (respectively
      indicated by “dilution coming initially” and “dilution coming in
      second place”) can be carried out between dilution coming
      initially and the bullage of the solution of corresponding given
      dilution, or can take place after the bullage, or can be
      concomitant with each dilution.<br>
      <br>
      In this last case, for this making, and as example relative with
      the concomitant rinsing with dilution coming in second place, one
      takes dilution initially coming an amount of this one with the
      rinsed apparatus (in a concomitant way to dilution coming
      initially), amount which one introduces into the tube intended for
      dilution coming in second place, then one takes with the same
      device approximately the half of the volume necessary to dilution
      coming in second place, and one rejects it into the tube intended
      for dilution coming in second place and one takes still
      approximately the half of the volume necessary to dilution coming
      in second place and one rejects it into the intended tube with
      dilution coming in second place, which has for effect to twice
      rinse the apparatus which has tracking the serving taking away to
      carry out dilution coming in second place, and so on.<br>
      <br>
      In what follows, the process such as defined cidessus will be
      indicated by “process comprising the step of bullage”.<br>
      <br>
      The invention relates to an automatic apparatus for the bringing
      in work of the defined process above, comprising: - means to carry
      out successive dilutions of an initial solution containing an
      active substance, which dilutions lead to solutions of given
      dilution, - means of bullage programmed to carry out the bullage
      at least after all ten dilutions, advantageously after all three
      dilutions and preferably after each dilution, - optionally of the
      means of rinsing between each dilution.<br>
      <br>
      The step of dilution is made up by what was indicated above, but
      can be carried out in any other way for example according to the
      method of<br>
      Korsakow out of single bottle, or else according to the method of
      the 50 millésimales or according to the method by continuous
      fluxion.<br>
      <br>
      The initial solution and the solution of dilution can be alcoholic
      solutions or of glycerin and are advantageously aqueous solutions.<br>
      <br>
      The process of the invention of preparation of composition
      homeopathic can also comprise a control of dilution and
      contamination of solutions of given dilution.<br>
      <br>
      The process of preparation of homeopathic compositions starting
      from solutions of given dilution coming from an initial solution
      containing an active substance, which process includes/understands
      the control of the dilution and the contamination of the aforesaid
      solution of given dilution, and is such as the initial solution<br>
      <br>
      - sudden of successive dilutions, the first dilution of the
      initial solution being obtained by taking away of a fraction or
      whole of the initial solution, and the mixing of this fraction or
      whole of the initial solution in a solution of dilution, which
      gives the solution of the first dilution, the second dilution of
      the initial solution being obtained by taking away of a fraction
      or whole of the solution of the first dilution, and the mixing of
      this fraction or whole of the solution of the first dilution in a
      solution of dilution, to give the solution of the second dilution
      and so on, until the solution of last dilution, each solution
      going of the solution of the first dilution with the solution of
      last dilution constituting a solution of given dilution, -
      successive dilutions being such as at least one of the solutions
      of given dilution contains active substance in amount low with
      10-10 moles, advantageously low with 10-12 moles/l and preferably
      low with 10-14 moles/l, or does not contain any more active
      substance, the aforementioned solution of given dilution still
      presenting an activity at great dilutions with that to which the
      active substance disappeared, is characterised in that - one
      introduces, before at least any of dilutions N, N being a great
      integer with 0, in the solution of dilution n-l a soluble pilot
      substance in the aforementioned solution and not interfering with
      the solution of dilution n-l, and the pilot substance presenting
      the property to disappear between dilution N - 1 + m and N + m, m
      being the number of dilutions where is present the pilot
      substance, and being included/understood particularly from 5 to 8,
      - one proportions pilot substance at least once after dilution N,
      preferably at least once in the interval going from dilution N at
      dilution N - 1 + m and at least once in the going interval of
      dilution N + m at dilution N + m + y, y being the range of
      dilution libr<br>
      <br>
      In this embodiment of the process of the invention, one uses like
      pilot substance, of a substance which is easily detectable and
      which is detectable until it disappears. In a beneficial way, one
      uses a detectable enzyme by his chromogenic activity.<br>
      <br>
      Presence of substance pilot in first the dilutions and its absence
      in dilutions extreme, (i.e. great dilutions with the quatorzième
      dilution and particularly with the twenty-third dilution) which is
      nevertheless active, affirm the relation between the phenomenon
      observed and the mechanism of high dilutions. Hand of an initial
      solution containing an active substance and one it is diluted a
      first time using a solution of dilution, which leads to a solution
      of the first dilution, which with his revolution is diluted, to
      give a solution of the second dilution, and so on to give
      successive dilutions, until the solution of last dilution. Each
      dilution leads to a solution of given dilution.<br>
      <br>
      The process of the invention is such as it makes it possible to
      control with each dilution (which gives place to a solution of
      given dilution), if dilution were correctly made and if there is
      no contamination. An improper dilution could, for example, to
      consist of the forgetting of a front dilution or of the
      introduction of a drop, container for example the active substance
      with last detected dilution, or the use of a badly rinsed pipette,
      which with such dilutions risk all to change.<br>
      <br>
      The process is such as it makes it possible to control each
      dilution and when the pilot substance is still present, to
      quantify dilution by comparing the calculated theoretical amount
      of pilot substance and the actually found amount. When there is no
      more pilot substance, there is no more either of active substance
      since the pilot substance disappears after the active substance.
      After a certain number of dilutions one must expect not only the
      active substance absence, but also the pilot substance absence.<br>
      <br>
      Like indicated above, dilutions will be located by the first
      dilution, the second dilution, the third dilution, nth dilution or
      dilution 1, 2, 3, 4,… N. In an usual way, last dilutions are
      dilutions 30 or 40 (decimal).<br>
      <br>
      These dilutions can be made according to any scale, particularly
      decimal or centesimal.<br>
      <br>
      In all that precedes and all that follows, the quantified values
      correspond, except opposite indications, with decimal dilutions.<br>
      <br>
      But, the term “dilution” can apply to centesimal dilutions.
      Progressively with dilutions, the diluted solution will be such as
      it contains 10-10 moles/l, then 10-12 moles/l, then a low amount
      with 10-14 moles/l. Generally audelà of this molar concentration
      per liter it has there no more molecules in the solution, which
      does not prevent the aforementioned diluted solution from still
      presenting, and in a completely unexpected way, an activity.<br>
      <br>
      Into the process of the invention, one can introduce pilot
      substance before any dilution, i.e. in any solution of given
      dilution.<br>
      <br>
      By “pilot substance not interfering with the solution of dilution
      N - 1” one defines a pilot substance such as its presence does not
      affect any the optional activity of the solution of dilution N -
      1.<br>
      <br>
      When one introduced pilot substance with dilution N - 1 and that
      one carries out the first dilution of the solution of dilution N -
      1 container the pilot substance, one continuous then to dilute
      until one reaches a dilution to which pilot substance disappears.
      The process of the invention implies at least a proportioning of
      pilot substance after dilution N. This proportioning preferably
      takes place at least once in the interval going from dilution N at
      dilution N - 1 + m, i.e. at least once of the first dilution of
      pilot substance to the dilution to which the pilot substance
      disappears.<br>
      <br>
      On the interval going from dilution N at dilution N - 1 + m of
      pilot substance, one can make in theory a quantitative
      proportioning since one after can each dilution of N with N - 1 +
      m to proportion pilot substance and compare it with the calculated
      theoretical corresponding value.<br>
      <br>
      When the pilot substance is such as it is not present any more in
      any solution of given dilution, it is also beneficial to make a
      proportioning for example on three dilutions which follow that
      from which the pilot substance disappeared, dilution pendant which
      one does not add pilot substance.<br>
      <br>
      This makes it possible to confirm that there no was contamination
      compared to the dilution to which one notes that there is no more
      pilot substance. In this case, it does not act more than one
      quantitative control but of a qualitative control permitted by the
      absence of pilot substance, the pilot subtance behaving then like
      a negative control.<br>
      <br>
      According to another embodiment prefered of the invention, one at
      least twice introduces pilot substance, one of the two
      introductions of pilot substance being carried out into the
      solution of dilution N - 1, pilot substance disappearing between
      dilution N - 1 + m and N + m, the other introduction is carried
      out to more - early into the solution of dilution N + m, and
      preferably into the solution of dilution N + m + y, N being a
      great integer with 0, m being advantageously included/understood
      from 5 to 8, y being advantageously included/understood from 3 to
      5.<br>
      <br>
      This process corresponds to the fact that one introduces a first
      time the pilot substance into the solution of dilution N - 1, one
      dilutes until the obtaining of a solution of dilution in which the
      pilot substance disappeared and without adding pilot substance
      again before this one did not disappear, if not the proportioning
      carried out on each dilution of the solution of dilution N to the
      dilution in which the pilot substance disappeared would not have
      any more a smell.<br>
      <br>
      It is thus waited until the pilot substance disappeared to add
      some again. One can again add pilot substance to the dilution
      which immediately follows that for which the pilot substance
      disappeared, but in a beneficial way, one again adds pilot
      substance from 2 to 10 dilutions which follow the dilution to
      which the pilot substance disappeared for the first time, and
      advantageously starting from the third, fourth or fifth dilution
      which follows dilution corresponding one to the disappearance of
      pilot substance.<br>
      <br>
      One can thus repeat the process of introduction of pilot substance
      all the times that this one disappeared or while waiting for 3
      dilutions with 5 dilutions after the dilution from which the pilot
      substance disappeared.<br>
      <br>
      In practice, according to the process of the invention, one can
      reintroduce pilot substance has regular interval, and it is enough
      for example to be able to detect pilot substance on 3 or 4
      dilutions, to show that the reduction in pilot substance is
      regular (thus that dilutions are correct) and that apart from the
      zones where the pilot substance is detectable, there is no
      contamination.<br>
      <br>
      According to an embodiment of the process of the invention, one
      introduces pilot substance for the first time into the solution of
      dilution N - 1, then one reintroduces pilot substance in the
      solution of dilution which follows that which corresponds to the
      disappearance of pilot substance introduced into dilution N - 1,
      then one reintroduces second once the pilot substance in the
      solution of dilution which follows that which corresponds to the
      disappearance of reintroduced pilot substance and so on.<br>
      <br>
      According to another embodiment of the process of the invention,
      one introduces pilot substance for the first time into the
      solution of dilution N - 1, pilot substance disappearing between
      dilution N - 1 + m and N + m, m being included/understood
      particularly from 5 to 8, one reintroduces pilot substance in the
      solution of dilution N + m + y, y being included/understood from 2
      to 10, advantageously from 3 to 5, and so on.<br>
      <br>
      According to another embodiment one introduces pilot substance for
      the first time into the solution of dilution N - 1, then every m
      dilutions, m being included/understood from 5 to 15,
      advantageously from 10 to 15, and advantageously still 10 or 15.<br>
      <br>
      According to a beneficial embodiment, the process of the invention
      is such as - the solution initial sudden of successive dilutions,
      the first dilution of the initial solution being obtained by
      taking away of a fraction or whole of the initial solution, and
      the mixing of this fraction or whole of the initial solution in a
      solution of dilution, which gives the solution of the first
      dilution, the second dilution of the initial solution being
      obtained by taking away of a fraction or whole of the solution of
      the first dilution, and the mixing of this fraction or whole of
      the solution of the first dilution in a solution of dilution, to
      give the solution of the second dilution and thus of continuation,
      until the solution of last dilution, - each solution going of the
      solution of the first dilution to the solution of last dilution
      constituting a solution of given dilution, - each solution of
      given dilution undergoes a vigorous agitating, - successive
      dilutions being such as at least one of the solutions of given
      dilution contains active substance in amount low with 10-10 moles,
      advantageously low with 10-12 moles/l and preferably low with
      10-14 moles/l, or does not contain any more active substance, the
      aforementioned solution of given dilution still presenting an
      activity at great dilutions with that to which the active
      substance disappeared, characterised in that:: - one introduces,
      before at least any of dilutions N, N being a great integer with
      0, in the solution of dilution n-l a soluble pilot substance in
      the aforementioned solution and not interfering with the solution
      of dilution n-l,<br>
      <br>
      * pilot substance presenting the property to be detectable at
      great dilutions with that from which the active substance is not
      detectable any more, and<br>
      <br>
      * the pilot substance presenting the property also to disappear
      between dilution N - 1 + m and N + m, m being the number of
      dilutions where is present the pilot substance and being
      included/understood particularly from 5 to 8, - one proportions
      pilot substance at least once after dilution N, preferably at
      least once in the interval going from dilution N at dilution N - 1
      + m and at least once in the going interval of dilution N + m at
      dilution N + m + y, y being the range of free dilution of pilot
      substance and being advantageously included/understood from 3 to
      5, - and of dilution N to dilution N - 1 + m one compares the
      value of the concentration of pilot substance obtained and the
      value of the concentration of pilot substance calculated according
      to dilution, which makes it possible to control dilutions
      quantitatively, and - dilution N + m with dilution N + m + y, one
      checks that there is no more pilot substance, which makes it
      possible to control on the one hand the quality of dilutions and
      on the other hand the absence of contamination.<br>
      <br>
      The pilot substance is endowed with the property to be detectable
      to great dilutions with that from which the active substance is
      not detectable any more, i.e. if it were introduced into the
      initial solution before the first dilution of the starting
      solution it disappears with a great dilution with that to which
      the active substance is not detectable any more.<br>
      <br>
      To fix the ideas, taking into account the available technical
      means to date, a substance is detectable by the usual biochemical
      means until an amount of approximately 106 moles/l.<br>
      <br>
      In certain cases, the active substances can be detectable up to
      10-12 moles/l. But, this implies very responsive detection
      systems.<br>
      <br>
      With regard to pilot substance, in a general way, it is detectable
      until approximately 3x10-10-3x10-11 moles/l, which corresponds to
      dilution 7 when the initial concentration is approximately 0,1
      approximately 10 mg/l, particularly from approximately 1 mg/ml.
      Amount in moles/l, until which the pilot substance is detectable
      corresponds to the limit from which one considers that there is no
      more pilot substance.<br>
      <br>
      Gold, the usable active substances in the process of the invention
      are detectable with concentrations of approximately lx10-3 with
      1x10-6 moles/l, i.e. until approximately the third decimal
      dilution, for an initial concentration of approximately lx10-3
      moles/l.<br>
      <br>
      According to a beneficial embodiment of the process of the
      invention, the pilot substance is introduced with dilution N - 1,
      and disappearing between dilution N - 1 + m and N + m, it is
      reintroduced with dilution N + m + there the interval m + y + 1
      being such as, - on approximately one of the two halves of this
      interval dilutions are such as the corresponding solutions of
      dilution are not active and - on approximately the other half of
      this interval, one at least of the corresponding solutions of
      dilution is active.<br>
      <br>

      dilution.<br>
      <br>
      To fix the ideas, the initial concentration of pilot substance is
      approximately 1 mg/ml, and that of active substance is
      approximately 1 mg/ml.<br>

      On this figure 1, given with illustrative and nonrestrictive
      titre, the pilot substance disappears between dilution 7 and 8,
      the active substance disappears between dilution 4 and 5, the
      interval of dilution on which the pilot substance is present is 0
      to 8 dilutions. On the half of this interval it be-to saying from
      0 to 4 dilutions, one notes that the present solution a certain
      activity whereas on the other half of the interval, i.e. fourth
      with eighth dilutions, the present solution more activity. On the
      interval from 0 to 4 dilutions, the pilot substance is such as
      there is an activity in the solution of corresponding dilution and
      on the interval from 4 to 8 dilutions the pilot substance is such
      as it does not have there only an activity of the solutions of
      corresponding dilutions.<br>
      <br>
      According to another embodiment, the present pilot substance the
      property according to which if it is introduced into the initial
      solution before the first dilution of the starting solution and if
      the active substance disappears (is not detectable any more)
      between dilution p and dilution p + 1, the pilot substance
      disappears between dilution p + X and dilution p + X + 1, X being
      included/understood particularly from 2 to 4, p being
      included/understood particularly from 3 to 6.<br>
      <br>
      In the know-indicated definitions, m corresponds to p + X, when
      the pilot substance is introduced into the initial solution before
      the first dilution of the starting solution.<br>
      <br>
      According to another embodiment of the invention, the process
      includes/understands the following steps: - one introduces pilot
      substance into the initial solution containing active substance
      before the first dilution of the aforesaid the initial solution, -
      one carries out successive dilutions of the initial solution
      containing active substance and pilot substance, the first
      dilution of the initial solution being obtained by taking away of
      a fraction or whole of the initial solution, and the mixing of
      this fraction or whole of the initial solution in a solution of
      dilution, which gives the solution of the first dilution, the
      second dilution of the initial solution being obtained by taking
      away of a fraction or whole of the solution of the first dilution,
      and the mixing of this fraction or whole of the solution of the
      first dilution in a solution of dilution, to give the solution of
      the second dilution and so on, until the solution of last
      dilution, the active substance disappears between dilution p and
      dilution p + 1 and the pilot substance disappears between dilution
      p + X and dilution p + X + 1, p being included/understood from 3
      to 6, X being included/understood from 2 to 4, the solution still
      presenting an activity for at least a dilution great or equal with
      dilution p + 1, - after the first dilution, one takes for at least
      a given dilution, starting from the obtained solution with the
      exit of the aforesaid dilution an amount sufficient of solution to
      proportion pilot substance, and preferably one proportions pilot
      substance with each dilution of dilution 1 with dilution p + X and
      preferably at least once of dilution p + X + 1 with dilution 1 + p
      + X + y, y being advantageously included/understood from 2 to 10,
      advantageously from 3 to 5, and advantageously still with each
      dilution of dilution p + X + 1 with dilution 1 + p + X + y, - and
      of dilution 1 with dilution p + X, one compares the value of the
      concentration of pilot substance obtained and the value of the
      concentration of pilot substance calculated according to dilution,
      what makes it possible to control quantitativemen<br>
      <br>
      According to another embodiment one introduces for the first time
      pilot substance before the first dilution, then one introduces
      pilot substance for the second time into the solution of dilution
      which follows that to which the pilot substance introduced for the
      second time disappears, then one introduces third once the pilot
      substance into the solution of dilution which follows that which
      corresponds to the disappearance of introduced pilot substance the
      second time, and so on.<br>
      <br>
      In a beneficial way, each introduction of pilot substance takes
      place from 2 to 10, advantageously 3 to 5 dilutions after that
      which corresponds to the disappearance of pilot substance
      previously introduced.<br>
      <br>
      According to another embodiment one introduces pilot substance
      before the first dilution and every m dilutions, m being
      included/understood from 5 to 15, advantageously from 10 to 15,
      and advantageously still 10 or 15.<br>
      <br>
      According to another embodiment, one introduces pilot substance
      for the first time into the initial solution, then all ten
      dilutions starting from the initial solution.<br>
      <br>
      According to another embodiment one proportions pilot substance
      advantageously all 10 dilutions, and preferably with each
      dilution.<br>
      <br>
      According to another embodiment the initial solution contains an
      active substance at a rate of approximately lx10-3 with
      approximately lx10-6 moles/l.<br>
      <br>
      According to another embodiment, when the pilot substance is
      consisted an enzyme, this one is selected among peroxidase, is
      particularly the horseradish peroxidase, detectable by its
      reactivity with the substrate D-phenylene diamine in medium H2O2.<br>
      <br>
      The initial solution and the solution of dilution are aqueous
      solutions, of pure alcohol, or glycerin, and a beneficial way of
      the aqueous solutions.<br>
      <br>
      The invention also relates to an automatic apparatus for the
      bringing in work of the defined process above, comprising: - means
      to carry out successive dilutions of an initial solution
      containing an active substance, which dilutions lead to solutions
      of given dilution, - means of bullage programmed to carry out the
      bullage at least after all ten dilutions, advantageously after all
      three dilutions and preferably after each dilution, - optionally
      of the means of rinsing between each dilution, - means to carry
      out the control of dilution and contamination of the solutions of
      given dilution obtained repsectivement at the end of successive
      dilutions.<br>
      <br>
      The solutions of dilution given, obtained in accordance with the
      defined process above comprising the step of bullage and
      optionally controlled as for their dilution and with their
      contamination can be used such as they are like finished drug, or
      can be used as active solutions, for the preparation of
      composition homeopathic Galenic solid.<br>
      <br>
      With regard to the solid homeopathic Galenic compositions, one can
      quote the granules or globules, which are made active by
      impregnation in a solution of given dilution obtained according to
      the defined process above comprising the step of bullage and
      optionally controlled as for its purity and its contamination like
      indicated above.<br>
      <br>

      This example is relative with the control of the activation and
      the inhibition of the achromasy of basophilic human, by using the
      comprising process the steps of bullage and verification of
      dilution and the contamination in accordance with the invention.<br>
      <br>
      Accurately, in this example, one checks the effect of high
      dilutions of an anti-IgE antibody on the basophilic human ones,
      the solutions of high dilution prepared and being controlled as
      for their dilution and with their contamination according to the
      process of the invention.<br>

      III PREPARATION OF the RANGES OF DILUTIONS Of ANTI-I9E (TEST),
      Anti-IgG AND ULTRAPURE WATER DISTILLEE (CONTROLS)<br>
      Dilutions of ultrapure distilled water prepared and are not tested
      systematically for all the experiments.<br>
      <br>
      1. Anti-IgE antisérums and anti-IgG<br>
      I1 acts of a antisérum of human goat anti-IgG (specific Fc,
      GAHu/IgG (Fc)) and of a antisérum of human anti-IgE goat (specific
      Fc,<br>
      GAHu/IgE (Fc))(Nordic Immunology, Tilburg, Tea<br>
      Netherlands) whose concentration in antibody is 1 mg/ml.<br>
      <br>
      The antisérums freeze-dried are taken again by 1 aliquot ml of
      water distilled ultrapure then out of tubes eppendorf (15 Al/tube)
      and preserved at -200C.<br>
      <br>
      The concentration in antibody is 1 mg/ml.<br>
      <br>
      2. Dilution of the antisérums and ultrapure distilled water<br>
      Dilutions are done under the control of a seeker foreign at the
      laboratory and responsible of the random processing of results
      (INSERM U292).<br>
      <br>
      They are carried out under hood with laminar flow on a
      Programmable controller 222-401E Gilson (Gilson<br>
      Medical Electronics, France) by using sterile tubes new pulleds up
      with the fate of 5 ml out of polypropylene (Greiner). The plug of
      dilution used is plug of Tyrode-HEPES containing of calcium 11 mms
      and adjusted with pH 7,40.<br>
      <br>
      One dilutes initially ultrapure distilled water, then the
      anti-IgG, then the antione. A cycle of rinsing is programmed at
      the beginning and fine of each range of dilutions. Those comprise
      29 tubes going from dilution 1 X 102 with dilution 1 X 1030 of
      distilled water ultrapure or the solution of antisérum anti-IgG or
      anti-IgE starting.<br>
      <br>
      As enzymatic tracer allowing to judge good practice of dilutions,
      one adds peroxidase (Sigma) at the same time as water distilled or
      the antisérum anti-IgG or anti-IgE. The peroxidase solution
      prepared to 1 mg/ml, aliquotée out of tubes eppendorf (15 Al/tube)
      and was preserved at -20 C.<br>
      <br>
      Performing of a range of dilutions<br>
      The 29 tubes of the range, voids and supporting the corresponding
      number with their dilution labeled with the felt, are placed on
      portoir it automatic apparatus<br>
      Gilson.<br>
      <br>
      In the first tube, corresponding one with dilution 1 X 102, 10 1
      of distilled water or anti-IgG or the antione (1 mg/ml) and 10
      peroxidase p1 (1 mg/ml) are added to 980 p1 plug of Tyrode
      containing of calcium 11 mms (plug of dilution). The tube is
      stopped and agitated pendent 30 dry on a Vortex.<br>
      <br>
      Dilution 1 X 102 made manually is replaced on portoir it and the
      automatic programme of dilution is then committed. After a cycle
      of rinsing with the plug of dilution, a syringe of 500 1 (piston
      stainless) takes 100 pl dilution 1 X 102 and aspires 400 it plug
      of dilution. The whole is rejected into the following,
      corresponding tube with dilution 1 X 103. Five hundred lil of plug
      of dilution are still aspired and rejected into the tube of
      dilution 1 X 103, which ensures the rinsing of the syringe. The
      agitating of dilution is ensured by a suction-delivery of 500 Tl
      of air, 5 times of continuation, with maximum of rate of delivery.<br>
      <br>
      Does the needle take then 100 p1 dilution 1 X 103, aspires 400? L
      then 500 pl of plug of dilution according to the same process that
      previously to obtain dilution 1 X 104 and so on de.<br>
      <br>
      With dilution 1 X 1030, the apparatus stops automatically and
      engages a cycle of rinsing. A new range can then be bringing in
      work.<br>
      <br>
      Scheme of the process of dilution automatic of the anti-IgE
      antisérum<br>
      This scheme makes the object of figure 2, on which one represented
      the automatic process of dilution in which the steps of agitating
      mentioned by “bullage” are made in accordance with the process of
      the invention and in which the step of agitating which follows the
      first dilution is made manually on an apparatus with agitating by
      eccentric.<br>
      <br>
      3. Coding of the tubes of dilutions of distilled water and
      antisérums<br>
      During an experiment “activation”, one tests<br>
      - ponderal dilutions 1 X 102 to 1 X 104 the antiones and control
      anti-IgG and/or distilled water;<br>
      - high dilutions 1 X 1021 to 1 X 1030 (audelà of the limited
      number of molecules calculated thanks to the number of Avogadro)
      the antione and control anti-IgG and/or distilled water. Any part
      of the range of dilution beyond the given limit by the number of
      Avogadro can be used;<br>
      - inner witnesses controlling the sensitivity with calcium of
      basophilic and corresponding one to the plugs of Tyrode without
      calcium and Tyrode with calcium.<br>
      <br>
      a) Performing of the code<br>
      In this protocol “activation”, all the tubes are tested into
      blind.<br>
      <br>
      The foreign seeker at the laboratory and controlling the
      performing of the experiments allots to each tube, following a
      table of randomization<br>
      - a number ranging between 1 and 30 when the experiment compares
      the effectiveness of dilutions the antione and anti-IgG;<br>
      - a number ranging between 1 and 43 when the experiment compares
      the effectiveness of dilutions of distilled water, anti-IgG and
      anti-IgE.<br>
      <br>
      For this making, the numbers corresponding one with dilutions and
      labeled with the felt on the tubes are unobtrusive with alcohol
      and of the labels supporting a code number are stuck on the tubes.<br>
      <br>
      Example: in the case of a code ranging between 1 and 30, the coded
      tubes will be<br>
      - tubes of dilutions lx102 to 1x104 the anti one<br>
      IgG (3 tubes) and of anti-IgE (3 tubes);<br>
      - tubes of dilutions 1 X 1021 to 1 X 1030 of anti-IgG (10 tubes)
      and anti-IgE (10 tubes);<br>
      - inner tubes of controls: 1) plug of dilution, Tyrode with
      calcium (2 tubes); 2) plug of washing, Tyrode without calcium (2
      tubes).<br>
      <br>
      b) Diluting of the coded range from 1 to 30 or 1 to 43<br>
      Of each coded tube, one takes 200 iil (Pipetman 200) which are
      deposited in tubes of agregameter of 1 ml. The tubes are stopped
      and carried by the person having made the code for a proportioning
      of optional, subsequent and independent control, immunoglobulines
      being able to be contained in dilutions (proportioning by
      polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) or any other appropriate
      control (mass spectrometry etc…).<br>
      <br>
      IV CELL PREPARATION<br>
      Before proceeding to the obtaining of an enriched suspension into
      basophilic starting from the blood collected on the anticoagulant
      heparin-EDTA (paragraph I), one determines the number of
      basophilic present per mm3 of total blood of the subject.<br>
      <br>
      1. Coloring and counting of basophilic on total blood<br>
      The basophilic ones are counted thanks to their property of
      metachromatic coloring with the blue one of toluidine.<br>
      <br>
      a) Solution of coloring: the blue one of toluidine<br>
      Hundred mg of blue of toluidine (Toluidine Blue, HEREINAFTER N0
      52040 C15 H16 CIN3 S, PM=305,84, Fluka, Mulhouse,<br>
      France) are dissolved in 100 ml of ethanol 25% and adjusted with
      pH 3,20-3,40 with 80-100 p1 of glacial acetic acid. The solution
      is preserved at ambient temperature out of hermetically closed
      bottle and at the shelter of the light.<br>
      <br>
      b) Coloring<br>
      It is carried out by mixing 90 1 of colorant and 10 p1 of total
      blood in the well with round bottom of a plate of microtitration
      (Costar). The mixing is immediately and gently agitated by 5 to 6
      suctions and deliveries using the pipette (Pipetman 200) having
      been used to deposit the colorant.<br>
      <br>
      c) Counting of the basophilic ones<br>
      Five to 10 minutes after the mixing of the blood and the colorant,
      this one again gently is agitated and immediately deposited in a
      chamber of Fuchs<br>
      Rosenthal (3,2 mm3) using a pipette (Pipetman 200).<br>
      <br>
      The blade is deposited in moist atmosphere (in one limps closed
      and humidified) to avoid its drying. After 3 to 5 minutes
      corresponding one at time necessary so that the suspension
      coloured deposited in the chamber of the hemocytometer, one
      carries out counting on a Olympus microscope with the enlargement<br>
      G X 10 X 20.<br>
      The basophilic ones are the single cells having a coloured
      cytoplasm. They appear red and are very easily identified on a
      pale bottom. In case of doubt, it is necessary to modify the focus
      in order to else distinguish the cytoplasms coloured into pink-red
      from basophilic from those of the other cells which remain
      transparent. The cores of the other leucocytes are slightly
      coloured into blue.<br>
      <br>
      Generally, on total blood, one counts on average 7 to 15
      basophilic per chamber of Fuchs<br>
      Rosenthal, their number which can go from 2-3 to 30-35.<br>
      <br>
      2. Obtaining of an enriched suspension into basophilic<br>
      When 10 the 1 necessary ones with the counting of basophilic on
      total blood are taken, of the Dextran<br>
      T500 4, % (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) is added at a rate of a
      volume for five blood volumes. The tubes are inclined and
      progressively sedimentation (20 min approximately with 1 X G at
      ambient temperature), one collects the rich plasma in leucocytes
      as well as red globules in suspension. The presence of these last
      reinforce the coloring of basophilic by the blue one of toluidine
      (viewing empirically made at the laboratory during the
      experimental tests).<br>
      <br>
      The sedimentation is collected in 2 plastic tubes of 10 ml to
      which one adds plug of washing (Tyrode-HEPES without calcium, pH
      7,40). After centrifuging (150 X G, 10 min), the bases of
      leucocytes (+ red globules) are joined together in only one tube,
      suspended in 10 ml of plug of washing and again centrifuged (150 X
      G, 10 min). The rich plasma in leucocytes is initially separate in
      2 tubes in order to better wash the cells.<br>
      <br>
      The base is finally included in aliquot of the same plug, between
      400 and 900 p1 approximately, according to the number of wells to
      be deposited (10 p1 suspension X time the number of wells + 40 to
      60 1 additional for the losses on the walls of the tube).<br>
      <br>
      One represented on figure 3 the scheme of the cell preparation.<br>
      <br>
      V- PROTOCOL OF THE ACTIVATION OF BASOPHILIC HUMAN BY the ANTI-IGE
      (ANTI-IGG OR WATER DISTILLEE As Control)<br>
      After the preparation of dilutions of antisérums anti-IgG and
      anti-IgE (and, for about fifteen experiments, dilutions of
      distilled water) and their coding, after obtaining of the enriched
      suspension into basophilic, one proceeds to the test itself, under
      hood with laminar flow. The process is identical in the case of
      the code with 30 tubes and the code with 43 tubes.<br>
      <br>
      1. Protocol<br>
      - Ten iil of plug of washing (Tyrode without calcium) are
      deposited at the bottom of 30 (or 43) wells at round bottom of a
      plate of sterile microtitration (Costar), by avoiding the
      peripheral wells where the risks of contamination and evaporation
      are larger,<br>
      - twenty 1 of each coded dilution (code from 1 to 30 or 1 to 43)
      is then deposited at the bottom of these same wells,<br>
      - the plate is preincubated 5 min at 37 " C, under Scotch tape and
      lid to avoid the evaporation of the contents of the wells,<br>
      - ten iil of enriched suspension are then added,<br>
      - the plate is then gently agitated by slow rotary motions in
      order to homogenize the contents of each well; it is substantial
      that this agitating is mild in order to avoid any contamination
      from one well to another,<br>
      - the plate is then incubated 15 min at 37 C, under adhesive tape
      and lid to avoid any evaporation,<br>
      - after incubation, 90 1 of blue of toluidine are added to each
      well and immediately agitated by 5 to 6 suctions and deliveries
      with a pipette multichannel. One changes cones between each row of
      well,<br>
      - after coloring, the plate is ribbon adhésifée and preserved one
      night at +4 " C before carrying out the reading. On cells, washed,
      the coloring is more homogeneous after several hours.<br>
      <br>
      2. Scheme of plate<br>
      <br>
      10 L plug of washing (Tyrode without Ca++)<br>
      + 20 p1 coded dilutions (1 to 30)<br>
      PREINCUBATION 5 min at 37 " C<br>
      + 10 y1 suspension rich into basophilic (+<br>
      red globules)<br>
      INCUBATION 15 min at 37 " C<br>
      + 90 toluidine p1 blue<br>
      CONSERVATION one night at +4 " C then READING<br>
      3. Reading with the optical microscope. Counting of the basophilic
      ones<br>
      The basophilic ones are counted the following day the
      experimentation consequently person who has prepared the cells the
      sleep. The technical one is identical with that of the counting of
      basophilic in total blood (IV-l-c paragraph).<br>
      <br>
      When the number of basophilic is substantial (great to 100 on a
      whole chamber of Fuchs<br>
      Rosenthal), it is possible not to read (for all the wells) only
      one half-chamber. So more than 150 basophilic appear on a
      half-chamber of Fuchs-Rosenthal, it is preferable to deposit the
      contents of the wells in the chamber of a hemocytometer of
      Malassez (1 mm3).<br>
      <br>
      Three to five minutes are necessary to count the contents into
      basophilic of a chamber of hemocytometer. A trained experimenter
      can prepare 3 to 4 hemocytometers at the same time with the
      proviso of storing those in one limps humidified in order to avoid
      their drying. In case of doubt about an account, it is possible to
      redeposit the contents of a well in a chamber of Fuchs-Rosenthal
      to proceed on a new account. Be born it is recommended not to
      renew this operation more twice for a same well because it seems
      that the taking away repeated with agitating can damage the sample
      and involve erratic results then.<br>
      <br>
      The numbers of basophilic are deferred in a table to the image of
      the scheme of the plate.<br>
      <br>
      4. Control quality of dilutions of antisérums anti-IgG and
      anti-IgE: Proportioning of peroxidase<br>
      The peroxidase is proportioned day-same experimentation,
      independently, by the second person taking hand with the protocol
      and not having made the experiment this day. The purpose of I1 is
      controlling the process of dilution and detecting an optional
      contamination of high dilutions by ponderal concentrations of
      antisérum, contamination which would be then responsible
      biological activity observed with high dilution.<br>
      <br>
      It is a proportioning by spectrocolorimetry with 490 Nm based on
      the reactivity of peroxidase with the substrate
      O-Phenylene-Diamine in medium H2 2<br>
      a) Preparation of the plugs and solutions<br>
      - Plug citrate pH 5,0<br>
      It is a mixing of 20,5 ml of a solution 0,1M of citric acid
      (PM=210,1) and 29,5 ml of a solution 0,1M of sodium citrate
      (PM=294,1).<br>
      <br>
      - Solution d10-Phenylene-Diamine (OPD)<br>
      Eight mg of OPD (Sigma) are dissolved extemporanément in 10 ml of
      plug citrate pH 5,0.<br>
      <br>
      The solution is preserved at the shelter of the light under
      aluminium sheet.<br>
      <br>
      b) Proportioning<br>
      In the wells of a plate of flat-bottomed microtitration 96 wells
      (Costar), one deposit successively<br>
      - 50 1 of each coded dilution (from 1 to 30 or 1 to 43) and of
      uncoded dilutions (1 X 105 to 1 X 1020) of the ranges of distilled
      water, anti-IgG and anti-IgE (Pipetman 200).<br>
      <br>
      - 50 1 of OPD with 8 mg/10 ml (pipette saddle jib crane
      eppendorf).<br>
      <br>
      - 10 H2 iil 2 30 flight. (pipette saddle jib crane eppendorf).<br>
      <br>
      One observes a coloring yellow-orange of the corresponding well to
      the most concentrated dilutions.<br>
      <br>
      To let the reaction be made pendent 10 minutes with the shelter of
      the light, under aluminium.<br>
      <br>
      To add 50 A1 (pipette saddle jib crane eppendorf) of H2 S04 9% (H2
      concentrated S04, diluted 10 times, 3% final in the well). The
      coloring previously observed is accentuated (coloring
      ochre-orange).<br>
      <br>
      To see immediately to 490 Nm with a spectrophotometer-reader of
      automatic plate (Dynatech Laboratories). The results are
      automatically recorded and printed.<br>
      <br>
      Scheme of plate<br>
      Example in the case of a code from 1 to 30<br>
      <br>
      5) Results “activation”<br>
      The results (numbers of basophilic + proportioning peroxidase) are
      given each day to the person having made the codes.<br>
      <br>
      The tubes corresponding one with each experiment are locked up in
      an envelope sealed and dated and preserved at +4 " C, with fine of
      subsequent controls.<br>
      <br>
      a) Interpretation of the results<br>
      It will be made after an independent statistical analysis, on the
      experiments selected according to following criteria's<br>
      1. Number of basophilic in the witnesses great with 35. The
      witnesses correspond to dilutions of distilled water, anti-IgG and
      with the inner witnesses (plug of Tyrode with and without Ca++).<br>
      <br>
      2. Anti-IgE activity with ponderal amount great to 40% of
      achromasy compared to respective ponderal dilutions of distilled
      water or anti-IgG.<br>
      <br>
      (The anti-IgG with ponderal amount can theoretically involve a
      achromasy of basophilic compared to same dilutions of distilled
      water or the witnesses “Tyrode with calcium”. One can call upon a
      recognizing of the slight chains of IgE by the anti-IgG or a
      anaphylactic reaction IgGdépendante).<br>
      <br>
      3. In the presence of single calcium, i.e. without addition the
      antione, the number of basophilic should not vary of more than
      25%. This is checked by comparing the number of basophilic put in
      the presence of Tyrode-calcium plug with that of basophilic put in
      the presence of plug of Tyrode without calcium.<br>
      <br>
      The achromasy is thus given<br>
      Nb basos of the pilot well - Nb basos of the well test00<br>
      Nb basos of the pilot well basos = basophilic<br>
      For each experiment selected according to criteria's<br>
      1) calculating of the difference between the average of the number
      of basophilic counted in the wells containing the anti-IgE
      solution and the average of the number of basophilic counted in
      the wells containing the pilot solution (distilled water or
      anti-IgG), for all the dilutions ranging between 1 X 1021 and 1 X
      1030.<br>
      <br>
      2) Research, also, for high dilutions the antione, presence of at
      least a peak of achromasy from 3 to 4 significant successive
      points according to given abacus (paragraph VI-2).<br>
      <br>
      b) Representation of the results<br>
      It is made after opening of the codes, at the end of 18
      interpretable experiments of activation (c.a.d. answering the
      criteria of selection).<br>
      <br>
      The number of experiments necessary was given after statistical
      analysis of the supplied results by preliminary experiments.<br>
      <br>
      The results are represented in the following way<br>
      Dilutions (anti-IgE, anti-IgG or distilled water) logarithmic are
      spans in abscissae while the number of basophilic is carried in
      ordinates.<br>
      <br>
      Each graphic corresponds to an experiment. I1 comprises<br>
      1) a curve which represents the variations of the number of
      basophilic according to dilutions the antione;<br>
      2) one (or two) curve (S) control (S) appearing the variations of
      the number of basophilic according to dilutions of distilled water
      and/or anti-IgG.<br>
      <br>
      According to the average number of basophilic obtained for pilot
      dilutions of distilled water and for the witness “Tyrode with
      calcium”, one defines a limit of significativity corresponding one
      in the number below which the effect of 1 ' anti-IgE (or the
      anti-IgG) will be regarded as significant. This limit generally
      corresponds to approximately 20% of achromasy. It is given by an
      abacus (cf. figure 4) and is represented in dotted line on the
      graphic ones.<br>
      <br>
      The lower the number of basophilic is by comparing with the
      average of the witnesses, the more the effect observed is
      significant.<br>
      <br>
      One represented on figure 4 the abacus to determine the
      significativity of the achromasy of basophilic human.<br>
      <br>
      The abacus indicates the significativity (p &lt; 0,05) of the
      achromasy observed for the basophilic ones. Example when 70
      basophilic is counted in the well controls, 56 basophilic, at
      most, must be counted in the well test so that the achromasy is
      significant.<br>
      <br>
      VI EXPERIMENTAL PROTOCOL OF THE MODULATING OF<br>
      The ACHROMASIE OF BASOPHILIC BY APIS MELLIFICA<br>
      This protocol is practised either at the same time as the protocol
      “activation” when the number of basophilic in the total blood of
      the donor is sufficient (great to 15 on a chamber of
      Fuchs-Rosenthal), or independently of the protocol “activation”,
      on the blood of another donor.<br>
      <br>
      1) Principle<br>
      The modulator effect of dilutions of Apis mellifica of 15 with
      20CH (Centesimal Hahnemannienne) is tested comparatively with
      corresponding control, NaCl 137 mms 20CH on the achromasy of
      basophilic in the presence of ponderal dilutions the antione. The
      effect Apis mellifica and of NaCl 137 mms is tested, as control,
      on the basophilic ones put in the presence of the single plug of
      dilution of anti-IgE, without anti-IgE.<br>
      <br>
      2) Dilutions of Apis mellifica and NaCl 137 mms<br>
      They are supplied by the Boiron laboratories<br>
      L.H.F. (Lyon, France) out of sterile ampoules of îml, in NaCl 137
      mms. The contents of the ampoules are transvased in new sterile
      tubes of 5 ml out of polypropylene, under hood with laminar flow.
      The tubes are progressively stopped and agitated pendent 30
      seconds on a Vortex.<br>
      <br>
      Identical ampoules are addressed to an outer laboratory in order
      to control the quality of the products by mass spectrometry.<br>
      <br>
      3) Coding of dilutions of Apis mellifica and of<br>
      NaCl 137 mms<br>
      In this protocol, we studied the modulator effect of dilutions 15
      with 20CH d'Apis mellifica comparatively with a control, dilution
      2OCH of<br>
      NaCl 137 mms.<br>
      <br>
      All these dilutions are tested into blind. An arbitrary code
      number ranging between 1 and 8 is allotted randomly to each
      dilution (6 dilutions 15 with 20CH d'Apis mellifica and 2
      dilutions 20CH of NaCl 137 mms) by the foreign seeker at the
      laboratory which controls the process and is responsible random
      interpretation of the results.<br>
      <br>
      For this making, a label supporting a code number is stuck on each
      tube containing corresponding dilution. The code is changed with
      each new experiment, of new labels supporting a new number
      replacing the previous ones.<br>
      <br>
      The coded tubes are preserved of one experiment at the other at +4
      " C under pendent aluminium sheet 2 weeks. After this time, a new
      procedure (transfer of the ampoules in the tubes and coding) is
      carried out and this, pendant all the duration of the experimental
      protocol.<br>
      <br>
      4) Ponderal dilutions the antione<br>
      Dilutions (1 X 102 to 1 X 104) are prepared manually out of plug
      of dilution (plug of Tyrode<br>
      HEPES + final Ca++ 11 mms, pH 7,40), under hood with laminar flow,
      out of sterile tubes of polypropylene 5ml, starting from antisérum
      of anti-IgE goat human (1 mg/ml of antibody) aliquot out of tubes
      eppendorf and preserved at -20 C.<br>
      <br>
      Ten p1 the antione (1 mg/ml) are added to 990 1 of plug of
      dilution. The tube is stopped and agitated pendent 30 seconds on a
      Vortex: dilution 1 X 102 is obtained.<br>
      <br>
      Hundred 1 is taken and added by it to 900 p1 of plug of dilution
      contained in a second tube.<br>
      <br>
      This one is stopped and agitated with its pendent revolution 30
      seconds on the Vortex. One obtains dilution 1 thus X 103 and one
      proceeds in the same way for dilution 1 X 104<br>
      5) Protocol itself<br>
      Initially were thus prepared<br>
      - dilutions d1Apis mellifica,<br>
      - dilutions the antione,<br>
      - the suspense cellular ion enriched into basophilic (paragraph
      IV).<br>
      <br>
      The test<br>
      - Ten 1 of each of 8 coded dilutions are deposited at the bottom
      of the wells at round bottom of a plate of sterile microtitration
      (Costar). Each dilution is as many deposited once as of amounts
      the antione to inhibit and once for the plug of dilution. In this
      protocol, coded dilutions of Apis mellifica and NaCl 137 mms are
      thus deposited 4 times (anti-IgE 1 X 102, 1 X 103, 1 X 104; plug
      of dilution).<br>
      <br>
      - Ten Ctl of suspension rich into basophilic are then deposited in
      each well.<br>
      <br>
      - The plate is delicately agitated by very mild rotation in order
      to homogenize the contents of the wells and is left 30 minutes at
      ambient temperature, under adhesive tape and lid in order to avoid
      any evaporation.<br>
      <br>
      - After this time of preincubation of basophilic with products 20
      p1 the antiones with dilutions 1x102 lx103, lux104 and 20 it of
      plug of Tyrode-HEPES containing of calcium 11 mms (and without
      anti-IgE) are added to the wells for each coded dilution of Apis
      mellifica and NaCl 137 mms.<br>
      <br>
      - The plate is gently agitated to homogenize the contents of the
      wells and is placed 15 minutes at 37 " C under adhesive tape and
      lid in order to avoid the evaporation in the wells.<br>
      <br>
      - After incubation, 90 Cl of blue of toluidine are added to each
      well and immediately agitated by suctions and deliveries, using a
      pipette multichannel. One changes the cones between each row of
      well.<br>
      <br>
      - After coloring, the plate is covered with an adhesive tape and
      is preserved one night at +4iC before carrying out the reading.
      The coloring of the washed cells is more homogeneous after several
      hours.<br>
      Scheme of plate<br>
      The witnesses “Tyrode without Ca++” (*) are added, as well as in
      the protocol “activation”, to control the sensitivity of
      basophilic with calcium.<br>
      <br>
      6) Reading with the microscope and account of the basophilic ones:<br>
      The principle identical with that is described for the activation
      of basophilic (V-3 paragraph).<br>
      <br>
      7) Results<br>
      The accounts the basophilic ones are deferred in a table to the
      image of the scheme of the plate and are given for each experiment
      to the person having made the code.<br>
      <br>
      a) Interpretation of the results<br>
      The experiments, after decoding, are retained for random
      interpretation only if they answer 3 criteria<br>
      1. Number of basophilic in the witnesses great with 35 (basophilic
      preincubated with of NaC1 137 mms or Apis mellifica and not having
      been put in the presence of anti-IgE).<br>
      <br>
      2. Spontaneous sensitivity of basophilic with single calcium low
      with 25% of achromasy by comparing on the one hand the basophilic
      ones which, preincubated with NaCl 137 mms, are, in the absence of
      very anti<br>
      IgE, put in the presence of Tyrode-calcium plug with, in addition,
      those put in the presence of plug of Tyrode without calcium.<br>
      <br>
      3. Presence of at least an amount the antione presenting a
      achromasy ranging between 40 and 60% of basophilic which,
      preincubated with NaCl 137 mms, are put in the presence of
      anti-IgE 1x102 at 1x104 compared to those put in the presence of
      plug of Tyrode-Ca++ without anti-IgE. This is based on preliminary
      studies which showed that below 40%, the achromasy of basophilic
      is too low so that the study of inhibition can be carried out.
      Above 60%, it is too strong to be able significantly to be
      modulated by agonists with high dilution.<br>
      <br>
      The achromasy of basophilic is thus given:<br>
      Nb basos of the pilot well - Nb basos of the well tests100<br>
      Nb basos of the pilot well basos = basophilic<br>
      b) Representation of the results<br>
      Three types of results (of number of basophilic) are obtained and
      must be compared<br>
      - the corresponding wells with basophilic put in the presence of
      Apis mellifica or of NaCl 137 mms but without anti-IgE give the
      maximum number of basophilic. They are the witnesses of reference.<br>
      <br>
      - the corresponding wells with basophilic put in the presence of
      NaCl 137 mms and of anti-IgE without Apis mellifica give the
      minimum number of basophilic (maximum achromasy).<br>
      <br>
      - the corresponding wells with basophilic put in the presence of
      Apis mellifica and of anti-IgE give a number of basophilic on
      which the optional modulator effect of the product is evaluated.
      The more this number will approach the maximum number of
      basophilic, the more the inhibiting effect will be large.
      Conversely, more this number will approach the minimum number of
      basophilic, more the inhibiting effect will be low or null. If it
      becomes low with this minimum number, the effect is activator.<br>
      <br>
      The graphic representation<br>
      For each amount the antiones tested, dilutions of Apis mellifica
      and dilutions controls of NaCl 137 mms are spans in abscissae
      while the number of basophilic is carried in ordinates.<br>
      <br>
      Each graphic comprises<br>
      1) a curve which represents the variations of the number of
      basophilic in the presence of anti-IgE according to dilutions of
      Apis mellifica and of NaCl 137 mms;<br>
      2) a curve which represents the variations of the number of
      basophilic in the presence of Tyrode-Caw plug without anti-IgE
      according to dilutions of Apis mellifica and of NaCl 137 mms.<br>
      <br>
      c) Statistical analysis of the results<br>
      The modulator effect of dilutions of APis mellifica is studied
      statistically by a test of rank of<br>
      Whitney-Wilcoxon at the end of a series of about fifteen
      independent experiments. One will compare, for each dilution of
      APis mellifica, the number of basophilic put in the presence of an
      amount of anti-IgE with the number of basophilic preincubated with
      NaCl 137 mms and put in the presence of the same amount of
      anti-IgE.<br>
      <br>
      These studies are carried out independently by the responsible
      persons of the control of the experiments and the random
      interpretation of the results. <br>
