      <p><i>PARIS (Reuters)</i> --- Visionary 19th century French writer
        Jules Verne once described a fantastical future world where cars
        would run on air. </p>
      <p>He may not have been totally wrong. </p>
      <p>Inventor, car enthusiast and environmentalist Guy Negre has
        built a car powered by compressed air and hopes it will be
        chuffing along roads across the world within the next few years.
      </p>
      <p>Inside Negre's car, cold air compressed in tanks to 300 times
        atmospheric pressure is heated and fed into the cylinders of a
        piston engine. </p>
      <p>No combustion takes place, so there is no pollution. In fact,
        says Negre, the air from the exhaust pipe is cleaner than the
        air that goes in, thanks to an internal filter. </p>
      <p>The car can be refilled with air at home using an electric
        compressor and Negre hopes that, one day, drivers will be able
        to recharge the cars in filling stations in three minutes for as
        little as three dollars. </p>
      <p>The air car, which he says will cost 6,800 euros ($6,700),
        looks a little like DaimlerChrysler's easy-to-park Smart city
        car, with one row of seats wide enough for three and a curved,
        pod-like front end. </p>
      <p>"We needed an alternative to the gas-guzzling norm so I decided
        to make one," the former Formula 1 racing engineer told Reuters
        at the Paris motor show, where his toy-like run-around nestled
        among the latest sports cars. </p>
      <p><b>TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE?</b> </p>
      <p>Negre, who has been working on the car for 10 years, admits it
        sounds too good to be true. But he says scores of industry
        insiders who first scoffed at his invention had been sidling up
        to his stand for a closer look. </p>
      <p>Some point out that, although the car itself pumps out no
        pollutants, the electricity needed to compress the air still
        comes from power stations that spew fumes or leave behind
        hazardous nuclear waste. </p>
      <p>Another big obstacle to making electric cars commercially is
        that, despite decades of research, they still need refuelling
        far more often than conventional petrol models. Some experts say
        there is no reason why the "air car" should be any different. </p>
      <p>"The concept of a car driven by air is not totally ridiculous,"
        said John Wormald at the Autopolis consultancy, adding that
        air-powered locomotives were used to help dig Alpine railway
        tunnels to avoid pumping out toxic fumes. </p>
      <p>"But as with all these wonderful ideas, the problem is how much
        energy density can you fit into a tank," Wormald said. "The
        car's range will likely be small and I can't see it taking off."
      </p>
      <p>Negre says his CityCAT car runs for a maximum of around 10
        hours at low speed before it needs refuelling. He insists this
        is not a problem as drivers will be able to recharge at home. </p>
      <p>Wormald said that would be impossible for anyone without a
        private garage or a space in a parking lot. </p>
      <p>Sceptics might wonder whether the big oil firms will be keen to
        equip their filling stations with a new technology that spurns
        petrol for air. </p>
      <p><b>TOWN, NOT COUNTRY</b> </p>
      <p>Negre admitted that the CityCAT -- which he says has a top
        speed of around 110 km an hour -- will work only as a city car
        and agrees he will probably not persuade motoring enthusiasts to
        give up their Mercedes and BMW speed machines just yet. </p>
      <p>"It's not a real alternative to the standard car," he said.
        "It's an urban vehicle that we will market mainly as a second
        car, targeting mainly women who tend to go for smaller vehicles
        that they use for short distances." </p>
      <p>Wormald reckons the business model is flawed. </p>
      <p>"The problem is that people just don't want to buy cars they
        can only use to drive round towns. They might not bomb off to
        the country every weekend but they like to know that they can if
        they want," he said. </p>
      <p>But Negre, who describes himself as a motorist who also cares
        about the state of the planet, rather than an all-out
        environmentalist, insists the air-powered car is the first
        viable alternative to conventional petrol-powered vehicles. </p>
      <p>"I'm a firm believer that the car means freedom and people will
        not give up freedom, no matter what it's doing to the
        environment," he said. "So the only way to save the planet is to
        come up with a car that doesn't wreck it." </p>
      <p>Conventional vehicles running on fossil fuels still emit a
        tenth of the man-made carbon dioxide which has been blamed for
        abnormal climate patterns and a host of natural disasters. </p>
      <p>Rather than selling the cars directly, Negre's company Motor
        Development International offers investors a factory package
        containing the machinery needed to build the cars. </p>
      <p>"We aim to have the first CAT on the road by mid-2003, with the
        first on sale toward the end of 2004," said Negre. </p>
      <p>He said MDI had already sold 32 of the small factories and was
        hoping to swell the total to 300 in the next few years. Each
        factory would produce 4,000 cars a year. <br>
        "The technology is all there," Negre said. "Now all we need is
        time and money to get the factories up and running." </p>

        to build 100's of small facilities that will produce 2,000
        vehicles per shift near the point of consumption which are the

      <p>MDI has been selling to investors a right of priority for the
        setting-up of a facility to manufacture zero pollution vehicles
        as per MDI patents. The right of priority is for a given
        territory. A population of 2.5 million people defines a
        territory. For example a city of 5 million people, there will be
        two facilities. The same investor can purchase the two
        facilities but shall always be the subject of a separate
        contract for a definite territory. </p>
      <p>The right for a specific zone costs US $ 300,000. This amount
        will give you the right to hold up to 30% of equity for a
        specific plant. Each plant will cost US $10 million. MDI Inc.
        will hold the other 70%. By the time we will start building the
        plant, you will have to invest an additional US $ 2,700,000 to
        cover your 30% of the US $ 10 million do investment. </p>
      <p>If you are interested, you can send you a copy of our
        Reservation of Zone contract for our turnkey factories together
        with our business plan. For Individual investors who are
        interested to participate in our project, we have devised
        another investment vehicle. The minimum investment is 10 000
        dollars at 100 dollars a unit which will equal to 1/10th of 1%
        of each individual plant. (Each plant will issue 100,000 units)
        The units will be issued to no specific site, which will be
        decided based on best opportunities at the time of the
        construction. Based on our estimates, for every 1/10% of 1% of
        one production unit, the investment will be paid back in year 4
        and thereafter a yearly revenue stream of over US $ 7,000
        representing an IRR of over 40%. </p>

        <p><b>THE ZERO POLLUTION CONCEPT</b></p>
      </center>
      <p><br>
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>After more than thirty years experience with combustion
        engines, the French engineer Guy Negre has developed a concept
        of a totally non-polluting engine for use in urban areas. </p>
      <p>This invention, which uses high pressure (300 bar) compressed
        air to store the energy needed for running the engine, is
        protected world-wide by more than 20 patents owned by MDI. </p>
      <p>In urban areas, the engine powers a five-seat vehicle with a
        range of approximately 200 km using 300 litres of compressed air
        (300 bar) stored in either carbon or glass fibre tanks. </p>
      <p>The recharge of the compressed air tanks is done by a
        compressor driven by an electric motor connected to a standard
        electric outlet. A rapid recharge, using a high-pressure air
        pump, is also possible. </p>
      <p>The MDI patents cover not only the basic principal of the
        utilisation of power generated by the release of cold compressed
        air into a hot air chamber, but also the means of making it
        economically feasible. For this purpose, the conventional
        cylinders, pistons and connecting-rods have been redesigned.
        Systems for the recuperation of energy have been developed as
        well as a new power transmission assembly. </p>
      <p>To demonstrate the viability of the concept, three prototype
        vehicles equipped with air, mono-energy, engines were developed.
        A taxi called "TOP" (Taxi zerO Pollution), a delivery van and a
        pickup truck were built. In May 1998, the first road tests of
        these prototypes were done in Brignoles, France. The news media
        have expressed a great interest in the zero pollution concept.
        Since May 1998, the taxi "TOP" has been the subject of more than
        35 television programmes and several hundred newspaper and
        magazine articles around the world. </p>
      <p>The potential market for the "clean engine" concept is immense:
        e.g., vehicles such as taxis, buses, vans, delivery trucks,
        industrial warehouse tractors, golf buggies, lake or canal boats
        and many other applications in which fixed engines are primarily
        used in urban or restricted areas. </p>
      <p>A version of the MDI engine can, in addition to air, also
        function with the use of traditional fuel; petrol, diesel,
        natural or town gas, at very low consumption levels. The change
        of source of energy is handled electronically based on the speed
        of the vehicle; e.g. below 60 km/h it runs on air and at higher
        speeds it runs on fuel. The compressed air tanks are recharged
        while the engine is running on fuel, using a built-in
        mini-compressor activated by breaking and deceleration. It is
        also possible to recharge the air tanks in 2 - 3 minutes at a
        compressed air filling station. </p>
      <p>To manage the development process successfully, MDI has
        contracted its product research and development activities to
        CQFD Air Solution, a company based in Brignoles, France. Here,
        under the direction of Guy Negre, some 20 engineers and
        technicians have at their disposal the most modern equipment for
        engine and vehicle development, testing and production,
        supported by the latest in information technology. </p>
      <p>Until now, the main activities of this group have been to
        perfect the engine and vehicle prototypes. At the end of 1998,
        in parallel with vehicle certification activities and the
        manufacture of the engines, a technical-commercial team was set
        up, responsible for marketing the MDI concept. </p>
      <p>As soon as the MDI engines and vehicles are commercially viable
        (within 1-3 years, depending on the version) they will have a
        market, with very limited competition, if any, for an estimated
        period of 10-15 years. </p>
      <p>Certain manufacturers have invested heavily in electric cars -
        generally recommended by public authorities as being the
        solution to urban air pollution. However, electric cars are
        largely ignored by the public due to high cost, limited range,
        long recharge time and the negative effects of battery
        replacement, pollution and a difficult recycling process. </p>
      <p>Another technique, which has consumed considerable investment,
        consists of powering vehicles by fuel cells. Professionals
        agree, that this technique is still far from being adapted to
        mass production, remains very expensive, is heavy and
        complicated and uses fuels which are, in general, dangerous and
        difficult to store. </p>
      <p>When the first applications of the MDI mono-energy engine have
        demonstrated the viability of the new concept, the air and fuel,
        bi-energy, engine will be introduced to major car manufacturers
        in order to study its adaptation for their common models. The
        engine will be produced by the manufacturers within their
        existing structures. The engine is significantly lighter than a
        traditional engine, it is less expensive to produce, maintain
        and utilise, it uses and pollutes less when it runs on fuel and
        is totally pollution free when it runs on air. </p>
      <p>The different versions of MDI engines provide the most
        comprehensive answer to the urban pollution problem: simple,
        economic and inoffensive. </p>
      <p>The commercial strategy is currently concentrated on the urban
        markets, with products including taxis, delivery vans and pickup
        trucks. </p>
      <p>Based on a new concept of local vehicle production and sales,
        MDI promote regional manufacturing license rights in the form of
        franchised turnkey factory systems. Such a turnkey factory will
        have a normal production capacity of 2,000 – 4,000 vehicles per
        year and will employ some 130 people. A model factory is being
        constructed in Brignoles, France. </p>
      <p>It is estimated that the first zero pollution vehicles will be
        on the market in year 2000. </p>

              Fleet</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>Imagine pulling your car into a service station, driving right
        past the gas pumps, and filling it up with air. That idea has
        come one step closer to reality with the announcement that
        Mexico City has purchased a fleet of 40,000 zero-pollution taxis
        powered by compressed air. </p>
      <p>The taxis, produced by Motor Development International (MDI) in
        Brignoles, France, will hit the streets of Mexico City sometime
        in 2001. Their two-cylinder engines, which use a combination of
        heated outside air and super-compressed air stored in under-car
        tanks, can travel 120 miles on each tank of air. Drivers can
        fill up at a gas-station air pump in less than three minutes,
        although filling up at home, using a household electricity
        source, takes about four hours. Remarkably, these vehicles don't
        stop at zero pollution -- they actually remove pollution from
        the air. When a driver brakes, the MDI vehicle takes in polluted
        air and filters it, expelling the cleaned air upon acceleration.
      </p>
      <p>In addition to air, a version of MDI's engine can also use
        traditional fuels at very low consumption levels. The choice of
        energy source is handled electronically based on the speed of
        the vehicle (below 60 kilometers per hour the car runs on air,
        at higher speeds on fuel). MDI vehicles are expected to be
        released internationally in 2000 at an average price of $13,000.

        wheels, a small start-up in Brignoles, France, has built an
        air-powered car that makes electrics seem like noxious
        nightmares. </p>
      <p>The company, CQFD Air Solution Sarl, is led by Guy Nègre, whose
        curriculum vitae includes designing engines for lightweight
        aircraft and Formula One race cars. Nègre came up with the
        aircar concept seven years ago while trying to develop a
        cleaner-burning engine. To power the pistons, Nègre's
        two-cylinder motor uses a combination of heated outside air and
        supercompressed air from tanks stored under the car. Already,
        the Mexican government is planning to purchase a fleet of 40,000
        compressed-air-powered taxis. </p>
      <p>At gas-station air pumps -- where others inflate tires -- Nègre
        can fillerup in less than three minutes. A tankful lasts about
        120 miles. And since carbon filters scrub the expired air before
        it's released, "it produces negative pollution," Nègre says. </p>
      <p>So far, Nègre and his team of 20 engineers have developed three
        prototypes -- a taxi (above), a van, and a pickup. The vehicles
        are expected to receive international release in 2000 at an
        average cost of $13,000. </p>
      <p>Technical data: 2 cylinder engine, uses heated outside air
        &amp; supercompressed air from tanks under the car, can fill up
        in less than 3 minutes at a gas station air pump, a tankful
        lasts 120 miles. </p>

      <p>A French engineer has invented an urban car that runs only on
        the air around us. The first ZP taxi - ZP stands for zero
        pollution -- will be unveiled in Provence later this month
        before going into mass production in Mexico. </p>
      <p>The inventor, Guy Negre, opened his engine laboratory at
        Brignoles in the Var three years ago to perfect a motor that
        runs on a tankful of compressed air. In urban road trials, his
        air driven engine mounted in a Citroen AX chassis ran for 10
        hours with a top speed of about 100 kmh. That is a better
        performance than any electric car in production. </p>
      <p>The Mexican version of the vehicle was designed by an Italian
        company and resembles a small family saloon with a separate
        compartment for the driver and four seats at the back. A Mexican
        licensee, Dina, has signed a contract to produce an estimated
        40,000 ZP taxis and urban delivery vehicles a year. It hopes to
        replace all of Mexico City's 87,000 petrol and diesel taxis. </p>
      <p>Mr. Negre, who worked on high-performance and Formula One
        engines for 30 years, runs his business, CQFD Air Solution, with
        his son, who is a former Bugatti engineer, and 16 employees just
        off the Mediterranean motorway to Nice. </p>
      <p>His silent, odour-free engine design was chosen for the world's
        most polluted city after a worldwide search by the Mexican
        authorities that included tests on dozens of electric and other
        non-polluting experimental vehicles. </p>
      <p>"My car was the only one totally dependent on compressed air
        for city running," says Mr. Negre. "Compressed air is used to
        start Formula One cars, but in this case the compressed air is
        the fuel driving a motor with classic components such as pistons
        and valves. But it is much lighter than the average engine." </p>
      <p>Sixteen patents have been taken out to cover an integrated
        system in which 300 litres of compressed air can be pumped into
        the tank under high pressure in three minutes. The car can also
        be refuelled at home in four hours by a small compressor in the
        car linked to the house electricity supply. While the air is
        free, the electricity used to refuel the tank at home would cost
        less than $2. </p>
      <p>The car is being studied by other countries, including the
        Netherlands, because it can also clean up air that has been
        polluted by petrol vehicles. </p>
      <p>"One of the vehicles advantages is the carbon filtering system,
        which means that the car sucks in the polluted surrounding air
        during braking and then breathes out purified air," says Mr.
        Negre. </p>

      <p>WITH nothing more than a slight wheeze as the compressed air
        tap was turned on by the driver, followed by a polite phut-phut
        from its eco-friendly motor, the bright green car that might
        change the way we drive in the next century set off for a run
        outside the workshop in this southern French city. </p>
      <p>Its designer, Guy Nègre, who abandoned the Formula One race
        circuit to build a zero-pollution car, had reason to smile as
        the vehicle accelerated as smoothly as a petrol-engined version.
        The demonstration was his first answer to the scores of skeptics
        who reacted critically when the Guardian Weekly first published
        the news in February of a compressed-air prototype that could be
        filled up for a less than $2 and run for 10 hours in urban
        conditions. </p>
      <p>From the pile of correspondence to the editor here is a quote
        from Graham F Andrews, in Gresham, Oregon, USA, summing up the
        skeptics' viewpoint. "In his writings on two cultures, C P Snow
        drew a parallel between liberal arts types who did not know the
        Second Law of Thermodynamics and technical types who had never
        read Shakespeare," he wrote. "By this standard your Paul Webster
        should either go back to school or be demoted to theatre
        critic." </p>
      <p>Apart from the fact that being appointed "theatre" critic
        should not be considered demotion, I had to check out his theory
        that it would need several thousand atmospheres to move the
        vehicle and that pressure would be so high that sitting on the
        air tank would be like sitting on a bomb. This big bang view is
        rather important as Mexico plans to mass-produce the vehicle
        under licence to replace the capital's 87,000 taxis. </p>
      <p>Preconceptions about noisy and greasy car factories take a
        knock on meeting Mr. Nègre, whose workshop in this town near the
        Mediterranean beaches, is as clean as a clinic. White-coated
        engineers build every component and chassis part for
        brightly-coloured toy-like taxis that would appeal to Noddy. </p>
      <p>Mr. Nègre is a down-to-earth, self-taught engine designer. At
        58 he is recovering from losing a fortune developing a Formula
        One motor that ran into opposition from big manufacturers. For
        this reason he has no plans to take on GM or Ford with a
        private-car version of the air-driven vehicle. </p>
      <p>"There is no point in clashing with the big firms when there
        are so many specialist slots to be filled," he said, before
        giving technical details of a motor known as the MDI EV3 C that
        uses nothing except the air around us. "The air tanks are a
        special design made in carbon and are 100 percent safe. They
        contain 300 litres of air at 300 bars and can be refilled in
        three minutes under high pressure. The car's maximum speed is
        100 km/h, and urban autonomy, with full tanks, is 10 hours." </p>
      <p>Without taking the compressed air engine apart or sitting in
        the car for 10 hours while it runs around Mexico City, there is
        no reason to doubt Mr Nègre's claims, backed up by detailed
        diagrams that have persuaded 160 backers in Britain and the rest
        of Europe to take up shares in Motor Development International
        in Luxembourg, which oversees investment. </p>
      <p>For skeptics who want to take the argument further, Mr. Nègre
        hopes to hear from them at CQFD Air Solution, Forum Aurelia,
        Route du Val, 83170, Brignoles, telephone +33498-051000. E-mail:

        <b><i>Time </i>( March 23, 1998 )</b> <br>
        <b>by James Geary</b> </p>
      <p>In Brignoles, France, engineer Guy Negre has invented an engine
        that not only runs on thin air, but improves air quality to
        boot. Negre's Zero Pollution Urban Taxi covers about 200 Km on
        300 L of compressed air, which is stored in tanks similar to
        those used by scuba divers. In addition to a combustion chamber,
        the Z.P. taxi has an expansion chamber that compresses air at
        high temperatures. A small quantity of this compressed air is
        then injected into the combustion chamber at room temperature,
        producing a rise in pressure sufficient to drive the motor's
        cylinders. Designed specifically for inner cities where
        stop-and-go traffic accounts for a significant portion of
        polluting emissions, Z.P. vehicles inhale a fresh supply of air
        in about a minute at specially equipped service stations or
        recharge in four hours at home using a small electric
        compressor. The zero-pollution cars are also fitted with a
        carbon filtering system that sucks in dirty air during braking.
        The result: air emitted by the Z.P. engine is actually cleaner
        than that of the surrounding environment. </p>
      <p>But it may take even longer to persuade automobile
        manufacturers to build it. Car companies "have a set mentality",
        he says. "The have already spent a great deal of money on the
        electric car, which turned out be heavy and expensive. They
        don't want to listen to another new idea." The Mexican
        government, on the other hand, is all ears. It's backing an
        order for 40.000 Z.P. Taxis to replace the gasoline and diesel
        models in Mexico City, which suffers from probably the worst air
        pollution in the world due to its high altitude. Mexico's City
        first pollution-free taxis will hit the streets in two years.
        while they are not yet ready to displace fossil fuels,
        zero-pollution vehicles can still play an important role in
        reducing the level of greenhouse gases. "If we start with taxis,
        then move to buses and vans, " Negre believes, "it will take
        very little time to improve the pollution problem in our
        cities." </p>

        is connected in turn to an expansion and exhaust chamber.
        External air is drawn into the intake chamber and compressed to

        transferred to the constant volume expansion chamber, wherein
        additional, ambient temperature, compressed air is injected
        therein. The injected air, when contacting the elevated pressure
        and temperature of the compressed air causes an expansion of the
        air within the constant volume expansion chamber. The energy
        associated with the air expansion is transferred to the
        expansion and exhaust chamber, wherein the continued compressed
        air expansion produces a work force that is imparted to a
        piston. The energy depleted air is then exhausted through an

        quick-operating plug (2c) which communicates them suddenly
        thereby causing, owing to difference in pressure levels, a wave
        expanding the engine gas which flows into the working chamber
        generating a compressive shock wave substantially increasing the
        pressure level in the chamber shortly before it is communicated

      <p><b><font color="#000000">Introducing the Tata Nano Car from
            India - Only $2,500 and 54 mpg</font></b> </p>
      <p><b><a
href="http://www.tatapeoplescar.com/tatamotors/index.php?option=com_frontpage&amp;Itemid=1"
            ">http://www.tatapeoplescar.com/tatamotors/index.php?option=com_frontpage&amp;Itemid=1</a></b>
      </p>
      <p>After months of rumors and tantalizing leaks Indian automaker
        Tata Motors has finally unveiled the Tata Nano -- its already
        legendary $2,500 car. As expected, the car that Tata claims will
        change the face of not only the Indian car market, but the
        global auto industry will be a four door, five seat hatch,
        powered by a 30 HP Bosch 624 cc four stroke engine mounted out
        back and mated to a CVT. </p>
      <p><b>Mr. Ratan N. Tata</b>, Chairman of the Tata Group and Tata
        Motors, today unveiled the Tata 'NANO', the People's Car from
        Tata Motors that India and the world have been looking forward
        to. A development, which signifies a first for the global
        automobile industry, the People's Car brings the comfort and
        safety of a car within the reach of thousands of families. The
        People's Car will be launched in India later in 2008. </p>
      <p>Speaking at the unveiling ceremony at the 9th Auto Expo in New
        Delhi, Mr. Ratan N. Tata said, "I observed families riding on
        two-wheelers - the father driving the scooter, his young kid
        standing in front of him, his wife seated behind him holding a
        little baby. It led me to wonder whether one could conceive of a
        safe, affordable, all-weather form of transport for such a
        family. Tata Motors' engineers and designers gave their all for
        about four years to realise this goal. Today, we indeed have a
        People's Car, which is affordable and yet built to meet safety
        requirements and emission norms, to be fuel efficient and low on
        emissions. We are happy to present the People's Car to India and
        we hope it brings the joy, pride and utility of owning a car to
        many families who need personal mobility." </p>
      <p><b>Stylish, comfortable</b> </p>
      <p>The People's Car, designed with a family in mind, has a roomy
        passenger compartment with generous leg space and head room. It
        can comfortably seat four persons. Four doors with high seating
        position make ingress and egress easy. </p>
      <p>Yet with a length of 3.1 metres, width of 1.5 metres and height
        of 1.6 metres, with adequate ground clearance, it can
        effortlessly manoeuvre on busy roads in cities as well as in
        rural areas. Its mono-volume design, with wheels at the corners
        and the powertrain at the rear, enables it to uniquely combine
        both space and manoeuvrability, which will set a new benchmark
        among small cars. </p>
      <p>When launched, the car will be available in both standard and
        deluxe versions. Both versions will offer a wide range of body
        colours, and other accessories so that the car can be customised
        to an individual's preferences. </p>
      <p><b>Fuel-efficient engine</b> </p>
      <p>The People's Car has a rear-wheel drive, all-aluminium,
        two-cylinder, 623 cc, 33 PS, multi point fuel injection petrol
        engine. This is the first time that a two-cylinder gasoline
        engine is being used in a car with single balancer shaft. The
        lean design strategy has helped minimise weight, which helps
        maximise performance per unit of energy consumed and delivers
        high fuel efficiency. Performance is controlled by a specially
        designed electronic engine management system. </p>
      <p><b>Meets all safety requirements</b> </p>
      <p>The People's Car's safety performance exceeds current
        regulatory requirements. With an all sheet-metal body, it has a
        strong passenger compartment, with safety features such as
        crumple zones, intrusion-resistant doors, seat belts, strong
        seats and anchorages, and the rear tailgate glass bonded to the
        body. Tubeless tyres further enhance safety. </p>
      <p><b>Environment-friendly</b> </p>
      <p>The People's Car's tailpipe emission performance exceeds
        regulatory requirements. In terms of overall pollutants, it has
        a lower pollution level than two-wheelers being manufactured in
        India today. The high fuel efficiency also ensures that the car
        has low carbon dioxide emissions, thereby providing the twin
        benefits of an affordable transportation solution with a low
        carbon footprint. (For more information: www.tatapeoplescar.com

        <h1><b><font size="+1">French compressed air car set for
              take-off in India</font></b></h1>
      </center>
      <center><b>by Pierre Thebault</b></center>
      <p><br>
        <br>
      </p>
      <p><i>CARROS, France - A car that runs on air?</i> </p>
      <p>What seemed like a pipe dream may soon become reality as
        Frenchman Guy Negre hopes versions of his compressed air car
        will be produced in India this year by Tata Motors Ltd after a
        15 year quest for backers for his invention. </p>
      <p>Negre believes the time is right for his design with oil prices
        at record highs and pressure on carmakers to improve the fuel
        efficiency of their vehicles. </p>
      <p>"It is clear that with oil at $100 a barrel this will force
        people to change their use of fuel and pollute less," Negre told
        Reuters in an interview at his firm Motor Development
        International (MDI), based near Nice in the south of France. </p>
      <p>"My car is zero pollution in town and almost no pollution on
        the highways," he added, saying the vehicle could travel 100
        kilometres at a cost of one euro in fuel. </p>
      <p>The former Formula One motor racing engineer's invention
        depends on pressurised air to move the pistons, which in turn
        help to compress the air again in a reservoir. The engine also
        has an electric motor, which needs to be periodically recharged,
        to top up the air pressure. </p>
      <p>The bottles of compressed air -- similar to those used by
        divers -- can be filled up at service stations in several
        minutes. </p>
      <p><b>EXTENDED RANGE</b> </p>
      <p>The latest versions of the cars -- MDI made an entire series of
        prototypes of engines and vehicles -- also include a fuel engine
        option to extend the car's range when not in reach of a special
        power plug or service station. </p>
      <p>Tata, India's largest carmaker with revenue of $7.2 billion in
        its last financial year, concluded a deal in 2007, investing 20
        million euros. Pre-production in India is set for 2008, Negre
        said. </p>
      <p>The vehicle, protected by some 50 patents, will cost some 3,500
        to 4,000 euros. Using composite materials, it will weigh not
        more than 330 kilos and its maximum speed is 150 kilometres per
        hour. </p>
      <p>"The lighter the vehicle, the less it consumes and the less its
        pollutes and the cheaper it is; it's simple," Negre said. </p>
      <p>MDI's models which typically have a rounded shape a bit like a
        speech balloon in a cartoon include the Minicat urban vehicle,
        the Citycat for longer distances with an added tank for ethanol,
        diesel or bio-fuel and a taxi version. </p>
      <p>Negre said he aimed to set up mini factories in regions where
        the car is used. "No transport, no parts suppliers. Everything
        will be made at the place of sale in production units that can
        make one car per half hour," said Negre. </p>
      <p>"That is more profitable, more ecological than the big
        factories of the large carmakers." </p>
      <p>Negre is not the only inventor working on compressed air
        engines. Urugay's Armando Regusci, Australia's Angelo di Pietro
        and South Korea's Chul-Seung Cho have also produced designs. </p>
      <p>But Negre has the backing of Tata, whose global ambitions were
        last week underscored when it was named preferred buyer of the
        Jaguar and Land Rover brands from Ford Motor Co. <br>
