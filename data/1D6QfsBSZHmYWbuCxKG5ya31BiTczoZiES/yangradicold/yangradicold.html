      <br>
      A team of University of Colorado Boulder engineers has developed a
      scalable manufactured metamaterial — an engineered material with
      extraordinary properties not found in nature — to act as a kind of
      air conditioning system for structures. It has the ability to cool
      objects even under direct sunlight with zero energy and water
      consumption.<br>
      <br>
      When applied to a surface, the metamaterial film cools the object
      underneath by efficiently reflecting incoming solar energy back
      into space while simultaneously allowing the surface to shed its
      own heat in the form of infrared thermal radiation.<br>
      <br>
      The new material, which is described today in the journal Science,
      could provide an eco-friendly means of supplementary cooling for
      thermoelectric power plants, which currently require large amounts
      of water and electricity to maintain the operating temperatures of
      their machinery.<br>
      <br>
      The researchers’ glass-polymer hybrid material measures just 50
      micrometers thick — slightly thicker than the aluminum foil found
      in a kitchen — and can be manufactured economically on rolls,
      making it a potentially viable large-scale technology for both
      residential and commercial applications.<br>
      <br>
      “We feel that this low-cost manufacturing process will be
      transformative for real-world applications of this radiative
      cooling technology,” said Xiaobo Yin, co-director of the research
      and an assistant professor who holds dual appointments in CU
      Boulder’s Department of Mechanical Engineering and the Materials
      Science and Engineering Program. Yin received DARPA’s Young
      Faculty Award in 2015.<br>
      <br>
      The material takes advantage of passive radiative cooling, the
      process by which objects naturally shed heat in the form of
      infrared radiation, without consuming energy. Thermal radiation
      provides some natural nighttime cooling and is used for
      residential cooling in some areas, but daytime cooling has
      historically been more of a challenge. For a structure exposed to
      sunlight, even a small amount of directly-absorbed solar energy is
      enough to negate passive radiation.<br>
      <br>
      The challenge for the CU Boulder researchers, then, was to create
      a material that could provide a one-two punch: reflect any
      incoming solar rays back into the atmosphere while still providing
      a means of escape for infrared radiation. To solve this, the
      researchers embedded visibly-scattering but infrared-radiant glass
      microspheres into a polymer film. They then added a thin silver
      coating underneath in order to achieve maximum spectral
      reflectance.<br>
      <br>
      “Both the glass-polymer metamaterial formation and the silver
      coating are manufactured at scale on roll-to-roll processes,”
      added Ronggui Yang, also a professor of mechanical engineering and
      a Fellow of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;“Just 10 to 20 square meters of this material on the rooftop
      could nicely cool down a single-family house in summer,” said Gang
      Tan, an associate professor in the University of Wyoming’s
      Department of Civil and Architectural Engineering and a co-author
      of the paper. &nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      In addition to being useful for cooling of buildings and power
      plants, the material could also help improve the efficiency and
      lifetime of solar panels. In direct sunlight, panels can overheat
      to temperatures that hamper their ability to convert solar rays
      into electricity.<br>
      <br>
      “Just by applying this material to the surface of a solar panel,
      we can cool the panel and recover an additional one to two percent
      of solar efficiency,” said Yin. “That makes a big difference at
      scale.”<br>
      <br>
      The engineers have applied for a patent for the technology and are
      working with CU Boulder’s Technology Transfer Office to explore
      potential commercial applications. They plan to create a
      200-square-meter “cooling farm” prototype in Boulder in 2017.<br>
      <br>
      The invention is the result of a $3 million grant awarded in 2015
      to Yang, Yin and Tang by the Energy Department’s Advanced Research
      Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E).<br>
      <br>
      “The key advantage of this technology is that it works 24/7 with
      no electricity or water usage,” said Yang “We’re excited about the
      opportunity to explore potential uses in the power industry,
      aerospace, agriculture and more.”<br>
      <br>
      Co-authors of the new research include Yao Zhai, Yaoguang Ma and
      Dongliang Zhao of CU Boulder’s Department of Mechanical
      Engineering; Sabrina David of CU’s Materials Science and
      Engineering Program; and Runnan Lou of the Ann and H.J. Smead
      Department of Aerospace Engineering Sciences.<br>
      <br>
      The research team, led by Principal Investigator Ronggui Yang
      (right) and Co-Principle Investigator Xiaobo Yin (left), will
      develop a system called RadiCold that if successful will enable
      efficient, low-cost cooling for thermoelectric power generation.<br>

      </b><b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Passive radiative cooling draws heat from surfaces and radiates it
      into space as infrared radiation to which the atmosphere is
      transparent. However, the energy density mismatch between solar
      irradiance and the low infrared radiation flux from a
      near-ambient-temperature surface require materials that strongly
      emit thermal energy and barely absorb sunlight. We embedded
      resonant polar dielectric microspheres randomly in a polymeric
      matrix, resulting in a metamaterial that is fully transparent to
      the solar spectrum while having an infrared emissivity greater
      than 0.93 across the atmospheric window. When backed with silver
      coating, the metamaterial shows a noon-time radiative cooling
      power of 93 W/m2 under direct sunshine. More critically, we
      demonstrated high-throughput, economical roll-to-roll
      manufacturing of the metamaterial, vital for promoting radiative
      cooling as a viable energy technology.<br>

      <br>
      The University of Colorado Boulder has received a $3 million
      federal grant to develop cooling technology that will enable
      efficient, low-cost supplementary cooling for thermoelectric power
      plants.<br>
      <br>
      The grant spans three years and is from the U.S. Department of
      Energy’s Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E).<br>
      <br>
      The CU-Boulder research team, led by Ronggui Yang, associate
      professor of mechanical engineering in the College of Engineering
      and Applied Science, will develop cold storage modules and a
      system called RadiCold that cools by infrared thermal emission to
      enable efficient, low-cost supplementary cooling for
      thermoelectric power generation.<br>
      <br>
      If successful, CU-Boulder’s design could provide power plant
      operators a low-cost way to supplement cooling without using as
      much water as they do now.<br>
      <br>
      “I am confident that we will be successful in developing this
      novel cooling technology that could be useful for both power
      plants and buildings,” said Yang.<br>
      <br>
      In thermoelectric power generation, only 40 percent of the energy
      in the fuel is used for power generation. The remaining 60 percent
      becomes low-grade heat that needs to be carried away by cooling
      systems.<br>
      <br>
      There are two types of cooling systems: wet and dry. Wet-cooling
      systems use water resources such as a river, lake or ocean and
      pass it directly over tubes containing condenser water, and then
      return it, warmer, to the original source. Dry-cooling systems use
      air to cool condenser water.<br>
      <br>
      Most U.S. power plants use wet-cooling technologies because water
      can cool better than air, which allows power plants to operate
      more efficiently.<br>
      <br>
      In fact, thermo-electric power plants are among the biggest
      consumers of fresh water in the world. Forty-one percent of total
      fresh water withdrawal - about 139 billion gallons per day - is
      used to cool condenser water. Three percent of the cooling water
      is evaporated and lost. This has an enormous environmental impact,
      especially in areas already suffering from fresh water shortages.
      These systems also release heat waste into the environment, which
      adversely affects wildlife, said Marta Zgagacz, of the University
      of Colorado’s Office of Technology Transfer and part of the team
      that will evaluate the commercialization potential of this
      innovative technology.<br>
      <br>
      Researchers say dry cooling has the potential to significantly
      reduce water consumption, but the high cost and low efficiency of
      current technologies discourage their use.<br>
      <br>
      Improved air-cooled heat exchangers can help overcome these
      challenges. Since air-cooled heat exchangers can only cool water
      temperatures as low as the surrounding temperature, supplemental
      cooling technologies - such as RadiCold - are needed to further
      decrease water temperatures in certain conditions.<br>
      <br>
      Methods to cool a building roof by sending long-wavelength
      infrared light into the dark night sky have been known for a long
      time. However, cooling under direct sunshine, and more critically,
      manufacturing these cooling systems in a scalable and
      cost-effective way are areas ripe for research, said Co-Principle
      Investigator Xiaobo Yin, an assistant professor in both mechanical
      engineering and in the materials science and engineering program.
      &nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      A RadiCold surface, which is a metal-coated micro-structured
      polymer, reflects sunlight and allows radiative cooling through
      infrared thermal emission for both day- and night-time power plant
      operation.<br>
      <br>
      Using the new system, a passive zero-energy consumption thermal
      syphon will collect cold water in a local storage unit beneath the
      RadiCold surface while a low power consumption pipe network
      collects the cold water from local storage modules into a central
      storage system that can be used to cool power plant condensers.
      Roll-to-roll manufacturing technology will enable effective
      radiative cooling at a low cost.<br>
      <br>
      “I am excited to work with my colleagues at CU-Boulder to
      transform innovative materials and component research into
      engineering systems,” said Gang Tan, assistant professor in the
      Department of Civil and Architectural Engineering at the
      University of Wyoming. “I also foresee great potential in building
      energy savings by developing cooling roof and ceiling systems
      using RadiCold surfaces.”<br>
      <br>
      In addition to these senior researchers, the team will include
      three post-doctoral research associates, three doctoral students
      and a few undergraduate students. Two MBA students from the
      CU-Boulder Leeds School of Business will work closely with the
      team on technology to market analysis.<br>
      <br>
      Associate Professor of Strategy and Entrepreneurship Tony Tong
      from the CU-Boulder Leeds School of Business is also part of the
      team that will evaluate the commercialization potential of this
      innovative technology.<br>

      Critical Need: In thermoelectric power generation, only about 40%
      of the energy in the fuel is converted into electricity. In other
      words, the power plant operates at about 40% efficiency. The
      remainder of the energy is converted to low-grade waste heat that
      must be removed to maintain the power plant's efficiency. Most
      power plants use water from nearby rivers, lakes, or the ocean for
      cooling. The water may pass directly over tubes containing the
      plant's heated condenser water, and then be returned, warmer, to
      the original source, or it may be evaporated to carry off the heat
      in water vapor. In areas with limited water or under drought
      conditions, dry-cooling systems use air to remove heat from the
      plant's condenser water. However, present dry-cooling technology
      reduces the power plant's efficiency and requires costly
      equipment. With water supplies becoming increasingly strained in
      many areas, economical dry-cooling approaches that do not reduce
      the efficiency of power plans are critically needed. Innovative
      methods to allow cooling below the daytime ambient air temperature
      and improve heat exchange between air and the plant's
      recirculating condenser water will provide the keys to ensuring
      the continued efficiency of power generation while decreasing the
      burden on water supplies.<br>
      <br>
      Project Innovation + Advantages: Researchers from the University
      of Colorado at Boulder (CU-Boulder) will develop Radicold, a
      radiative cooling and cold water storage system to enable
      supplemental cooling for thermoelectric power plants. In the
      Radicold system, condenser water circulates through a series of
      pipes and passes under a number of cooling modules before it is
      sent to the central water storage unit. Each cooling module
      consists of a novel radiative-cooling surface integrated on top of
      a thermosiphon, thereby simultaneously cooling the water and
      eliminating the need for a pump to circulate it. The
      microstructured polymer film discharges heat from the water by
      radiating in the infrared through the Earth's atmosphere into the
      heat sink of cold, deep space. Below the film, a metal film
      reflects all incoming sunlight. This results in cooling with a
      heat flux of more than 100 W/m2 during both day and nighttime
      operation. CU-Boulder will use roll-to-roll manufacturing, a
      low-cost manufacturing technique that is capable of high-volume
      production, to fabricate the microstructured RadiCold film.<br>
      <br>
      Potential Impact: If successful, CU-Boulder's design could provide
      power plant operators a low-cost way to supplement cooling without
      consuming additional water.<br>
      <br>
      Security: Power plants can maintain energy efficiency by using the
      team's dry-cooling technology instead of water cooling when water
      use is restricted.<br>
      <br>
      Environment: The team's system enables more efficient radiative
      cooling - eliminating the need for additional water or power
      inputs to cool power plant condenser water.<br>
      <br>
      Economy: By applying low-cost manufacturing techniques, CU-Boulder
      estimates the structure will be an economical option for dry
      cooling.<br>

      Methods, apparatuses, and systems are disclosed for flexible
      thermal ground planes. A flexible thermal ground plane may include
      a support member. The flexible thermal ground plane may include an
      evaporator region or multiple evaporator regions configured to
      couple with the support member. The flexible thermal ground plane
      may include a condenser region or multiple condenser regions
      configured to couple with the support member. The evaporator and
      condenser region may include a microwicking structure. The
      evaporator and condenser region may include a nanowicking
      structure coupled with the micro-wicking structure, where the
      nanowicking structure includes nanorods. The evaporator and
      condenser region may include a nanomesh coupled with the nanorods
      and/or the microwicking structure. Some embodiments may include a
      micromesh coupled with the nanorods and/or the microwicking
      structure..<br>
      <br>
      B<b>ACKGROUND</b><br>
      <br>
      This application relates generally to thermal ground planes. More
      specifically, this application relates to methods, apparatuses,
      and systems for flexible thermal ground planes.<br>
      <br>
      The complexity and size of integrated circuits may been limited by
      the heat generated. Heat pipes have been used to transfer heat
      efficiently from one location to another. They have also been used
      to cool integrated circuits. The existing heat pipes for these
      purposes may consist of a rigid structure composed of copper,
      silicon, etc. Some modern electrical devices and systems demand a
      flexible circuit board along with a high capacity for heat
      dissipation.<br>
      <br>
      There is thus a need for methods, systems, and devices that may
      also be flexible while transferring heat efficiently from one
      location to another or spread high flux heat from a small area to
      low heat flux over a larger area.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BRIEF SUMMARY</b><br>
      <br>
      Certain embodiments thus provide methods, systems, and devices
      that may include a flexible thermal ground plane. Embodiments of
      flexible thermal ground planes may provide extremely high thermal
      performance with high evaporation/condensation heat transfer and
      effective liquid supply. Flexible configurations may be enabled by
      using polymer casing laminated and covered by moisture barrier
      coatings, enabled by atomic layer deposition, chemical vapor
      deposition, physical vapor deposition, or thin metal laminate,
      merely by way of example. Embodiments of flexible thermal ground
      planes may also involve low cost construction resulting from large
      size manufacturing, e.g. 3 ft wide and 1000 ft long, merely by way
      of example. For example, flexible thermal ground plane
      construction may take advantage of flexible circuit board
      manufacturing technology. Large size flexible thermal ground
      planes may thus be constructed for some embodiments, e.g. 20 cm by
      40 cm by 1 mm, merely by way of example...<br>
