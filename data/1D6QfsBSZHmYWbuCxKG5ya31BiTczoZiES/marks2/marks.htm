      <p>A SOLAR POWER CONVERTER THAT MAY CUT THE COST OF
        SUNLIGHT-SPAWNED HOME ELECTRICITY BY AS MUCH AS 90% has been
        patented by Alvin M. Marks. The device, called the Lepcon, uses
        submicron antennas on a glass plate to convert sunlight into
        high-frequency alternating current, which is then changed by a
        miniature circuit to direct current. The inventor estimates the
        cost of electricity from the Lepcon at about 500 per watt, as
        compared to the $5.00 per watt typical of conventional
        silicon-crystal photovoltaic equipment. Mr. Marks also claims a
        75% efficiency rate for his invention (versus a theoretical 20%,
        and a thus-far-achieved 8% to 10% rate, for standard solar
        cells). If mass-produced, a 100-square-foot Lepcon roof panel
        would cost about $1,500 and generate sufficient power for a
        small household. A photovoltaic array producing the same output
        would cost approximately $75,000. (The catch, of course, is that
        the Lepcon is not yet commercially available, and may not be for
        quite some time.) </p>

        <p>( Published: September 9, 1986 )</p>
      </center>
      <p>In a quiet research laboratory here, an inventor is developing
        solar power devices designed to operate four or five times more
        efficiently than the best photovoltaic cells now in use, and at
        a small fraction of the cost. </p>
      <p>Alvin M. Marks, an inventor who holds patents for a 3-D movie
        process and polarized film for sunglasses, is working with the
        Westinghouse Electric Corporation to build prototypes of the
        solar power devices. He received one patent for the devices
        earlier this year and another in 1984. </p>
      <p>The Exxon Corporation recently offered $9 million for Mr.
        Marks's patents, and for Phototherm, the small company that
        controls them, according to Gerard J. Aitken 3d, chairman of
        Phototherm's board. But company officials chose not to sell;
        instead they signed the development contract with Westinghouse,
        which says it is particularly interested in the technology's
        applications for Strategic Defense Initiative, or Star Wars. </p>
      <p>Mr. Marks says solar panels made with Lepcon or Lumeloid, the
        materials he patented, could turn 70 to 80 percent of the energy
        from sunlight they receive into electricity. Most photovoltaic
        cells are only about 15 percent efficient. The electricity would
        cost three or four cents per kilowatt hour, as against about 10
        cents a kilowatt hour for commercially generated electric power.
        Most photovoltaic cells produce energy for around $1 per
        kilowatt hour. </p>
      <p>Typical photovoltaic cells use layers of chemically treated
        metals that produce electric current when struck by sunlight.
        The basic problem has always been the quantity of current
        produced per unit cost of the materials used to produce it. </p>
      <p>Lepcon, which was a preliminary design, consists of glass
        panels covered with a vast array of millions of aluminum or
        copper strips, each less than a micron or thousandth of a
        millimeter wide. As sunlight hits the metal strips, the energy
        in the light is transferred to electrons in the metal, which
        escape at one end in the form of electricity. </p>
      <p>Lumeloid uses a similar approach, but substitutes cheaper,
        filmlike sheets of plastic for the glass panels and covers the
        plastic with conductive polymers, long chains of molecular
        plastic units. Lumeloid is easier to manufacture and handle than
        Lepcon. The company declines, for competitive reasons, to
        identify the chemicals it uses to produce Lumeloid polymers. </p>
      <p>There are as yet no large-scale working prototypes of Mr.
        Mark's invention, and some scientists have expressed caution in
        assessing it. ''It is beyond our technological fabrication
        capability at present,'' said Dr. Edward D. Wolf, the director
        of the national research facility for submicron structures at
        Cornell University, who has studied Mr. Marks's work. ''But it's
        an interesting concept.'' </p>
      <p>Professor Stuart A. Rice, dean of the division of physical
        sciences at the University of Chicago, has also reviewed the
        patents. </p>
      <p>''It is an intellectually challenging idea,'' he said. ''I do
        not know whether it can be brought into practice, so I don't
        know whether to be optimistic or pessimistic. If it turned out
        to work, and was very efficient, it would be very significant.''
      </p>
      <p>Mr. Marks said he believed Lumeloid would be available for
        commercial use within two or three years. He added that Lepcon
        and Lumeloid could be used to create lasers, an application he
        said he had discussed with the Pentagon, in conjunction with
        Westinghouse. </p>
      <p>Mr. Marks conceded that getting his ideas to the major
        prototype stage would cost around $5 million. Commercial
        production of solar panels would cost between $30 million to $50
        million, he estimated, and the preliminary work, supported by
        Westinghouse, is now underway, he said. </p>
      <p>Phototherm plans a $15 million initial public stock offering
        soon to help subsidize development of the solar patents. </p>
      <p>Mr. Marks has more than 100 other patents, including the film
        used on polarized sunglasses, and the process to make 3-D
        movies, and he was also an energy adviser to President John F.
        Kennedy. </p>

        (9/19/2000) </p>
      <p>Lumeloid film resulted from many years of dedication by
        Inventor Dr. Alvin M. Marks and over 25 researchers at Advanced
        Research Development Inc. (ARDI). ARDI has demonstrated
        Lumeloid's potential. Lumeloid could reach the market in the
        year 2001, making a major breakthrough in the $1 billion
        solar-electricity industry in direct competition with the
        trillion-dollar fossil fuel industry. </p>
      <p>Success of Lumeloid would also be a first step toward a
        sustainable energy economy, replacing fossil-fuel energy
        generation on a massive scale. Governments and markets are
        already reacting to the global warming threat by expanding
        renewable energy programs. The productivity losses from fossil
        fuel pollution are taking on increasing toll. </p>
      <p>Many Lumeloid refinements patented by Dr. Marks are part of his
        work in fields related to Lumeloid's underlying polarized film
        technology including more than 120 patents. In addition to a
        long and distinguished business and academic career, he served
        on President Kennedy's Committee on New Power Technologies and
        has received multiple honoraria and doctoral degrees. </p>
      <p>Lumeloid, classified as a polymeric photovoltaic device, is
        constructed from very inexpensive, non-toxic polymer materials
        and will be manufactured by processes in large production.
        Finished Lumeloid product will comprise a thin film about 0.3
        microns thick on a low cost plastic roll. We project installed
        Lumeloid cost at 20% that of conventional PV and lower than
        natural gas and coal, or about 75 cents per watt. </p>
      <p>Lumeloid does not use semiconductor principles to generate
        electricity, but exploits the same techniques radio antennae use
        to absorb radio waves; except that Lumeloid absorbs nano-scale
        visible light waves, in a process which in part mimics
        photosynthesis. The linear light polarizing molecules in the
        film act as the antennae to absorb the energy of a resolved
        component of photons incident on the film. </p>
      <p>Dr. Marks and his team recently reached important R&amp;D
        milestones, identifying the formulation and process that may
        soon yield commercial grade film and process procedures. If
        these preliminary results bear out, a commercial prototype could
        be produced in nine months, which will demonstrate economic
        viability. As soon as this is achieved, commercial investments
        and partners will propel Lumeloid into the marketplace. This
        work is dependent on financial support for research and
        development. </p>
      <p>Approximately $1.5M U.S. Government funds and many millions of
        dollars from private funds have supported this work. The
        progress to date is the result of enormous time contributions of
        Dr. Marks and many others including about 25 researchers in the
        best academic and private institutions. Government funding has
        recently diminished with the cutbacks in funding for renewable
        energy. </p>
      <p>Within 12 months we predict demonstrated 10% efficiency at
        projected $4.00 per installed watt depending on adequate funding
        for research. After this demonstration publicly raised money
        will propel Lumeloid into the market place. The small privately
        held corporation Advanced Research and Development, Inc. (ARDI)
        was formed in 1982 to further Lumeloid research. The research
        requires an additional $1 million for the next nine months of
        research and development. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;Dr. Marks and his team are dedicated to growing this
        technology into a worldwide resource for clean energy. We are
        motivated by the enormous business opportunities, but more so by
        the benefit to the global environment and to all people and life
        on earth. </p>
      <p><b>Introduction</b> </p>
      <p>Lumeloid Solar Film is a new solar energy technology with the
        potential to provide very low cost, efficient, nonpolluting
        solar electric power. </p>
      <p>Inventor Dr. Alvin M. Marks and a network of over 25
        researchers have achieved demonstrable successes in proving
        Lumeloid's practical potential. Lumeloid could reach market by
        2001. Success will be a major breakthrough toward a sustainable
        energy economy, replacing fossil-fuel energy generation on a
        massive scale. </p>
      <p>Lumeloid is classified as a polymeric light polarizing
        photovoltaic device. It comprises a photovoltaic polarized film
        on a Mylar substrate with microelectronic circuitry. Lumeloid
        has a theoretical sunlight to electricity conversion efficiency
        of 72% (as compared to 33% for current semiconductor solar cell
        technology.) Very low manufacturing costs for Lumeloid along
        with its high efficiency create the potential for a many fold
        decrease in the cost of solar electricity. </p>
      <p>Dr. Marks and his team are dedicated to growing this technology
        into a worldwide resource for clean energy. We are motivated by
        the enormous business opportunities, but more so by the benefit
        to all the people and their global environment. </p>
      <p><b>Renewable Energy - Cornerstone of the Sustainable Economy</b>
      </p>
      <p>The world's leaders met at Rio de Janero, Kyoto and Buenos
        Aires to find ways to avoid the catastrophic effects of global
        warming - the warming of the Earth's atmosphere from heat
        trapped by atmospheric carbon dioxide emitted from human
        activities, primarily burning fossil-fuels. Already detectable
        increases in global air and ocean temperatures have been
        measured. </p>
      <p>The LEPCON Femto Diode concept is similar in principle to
        Lumeloid, and was also invented by Alvin Marks. In contrast to
        Lumeloid, however, LEPCON comprises more durable materials of
        submicron metal on a glass substrate sheet. LEPCON designs have
        been used as a test bed for Lumeloid concepts, and may also
        yield product breakthroughs of its own. </p>
      <p><b>Lumeloid R&amp;D</b> </p>
      <p>Dr. Alvin M. Marks is the inventor of Lumeloid and holds the
        1984 patenton the original configuration and multiple patents on
        refinements. After many years of work, light to electric power
        conversion by a Lumeloid film was demonstrated in our laboratory
        on April 5, 1996. Although the conversion efficiency was very
        low, we achieved proof of concept, and we now understand the
        mechanisms that are increasing measured efficiencies toward the
        expected levels. </p>
      <p>Dr. Marks holds over 120 patents dating back to the original
        polarized film patents in the 1930's. His distinguished career
        includes the start up of highly successful companies in the
        polarized film industry, a seat on President Kennedy's Science
        Power Advisory panel, honoraria, a doctoral degree and many
        published articles and broadcast media appearances. </p>
      <p>In 1982 he turned his attention to solar energy technology at
        the urging of United Nations Energy Director Dr, Ishrat Usmani.
        Dr. Usmani's solar project in Africa had recently been cancelled
        because of the high cost and low efficiency of photovoltaics. At
        a dinner meeting the delegate turned to Dr. Marks and urged him
        to develop cost-effective solar technology. Dr. Marks' unique
        experience in the related fields of polarized film development
        and manufacturing, radio antenna theory, physical optics,
        quantum mechanics, chemistry and business led him to the
        invention of Lumeloid. </p>
      <p>For many years, ARDI has been funded by the U.S. Government and
        private funds. Approximately $16M has been gone into Lumeloid
        R&amp;D to date. </p>
      <p>To test the concepts of Lumeloid and LEPCON, ARDI received US
        Government funding to work with Texas A&amp;M and Cornell
        Universities. The direct conversion of light energy to electric
        energy based on Dr. Marks patent was first demonstrated at Texas
        A&amp;M University and favorably reported in the Journal of
        Applied Physics, vol. 80 (1) 1 July 1996 </p>
      <p>Dr. Marks has many years of experience at the forefront of this
        field. As partner in creation of Marks Polarized Corporation he
        led the field for many years. It will take little original
        research or technological development to produce Lumeloid once a
        working configuration is demonstrated. </p>
      <p><b>Organization and People Behind Lumeloid</b> </p>
      <p>Lumeloid research is now conducted at Advanced Research &amp;
        Development, Inc. (ARDI) a small research corporation owned and
        operated by Dr. Marks. ARDI was founded in 1982 in Athol,
        Massachusetts and now occupies an entire floor. </p>
      <p>The testing and fabrication equipment are state of the art and
        provide a strong foundation for the Lumeloid research. To
        support its position at the cutting edge of conducting polarized
        film development, ARDI maintains extensive laboratory facilities
        dedicated to the production and characterization of conducting
        polarized films and fabrication techniques. The effectiveness of
        the facilities is evidenced by the successful R&amp;D performed
        to date. </p>
      <p><b>Dr. Alvin Marks</b> </p>
      <p>Senior Scientist and President of ARDI Alvin Marks will serve
        as Principal Investigator for the research and development of
        his patented invention Lumeloid. He is a theoretical physicist
        and mathematician who has been engaged in the research,
        development, and commercialization of polarized technologies for
        the past 50 years. He holds 121 U.S. patents, with more than 50
        patents in polarizing materials. His research on photosynthetic
        chemistry and polarized films demonstrates that the Lumeloid
        concept is unique and may advance photovoltaic effici </p>

        the national research facility for submicron structures at
        Cornell University, who has studied Mr Marks's work."But it's an
        interesting concept." </p>
      <p>Professor Stuart A Rice, dean of the division of physical
        sciences at the University of Chicago, has also reviewed the
        patents. </p>
      <p>"It is an intellectually challenging idea," he said, "I do not
        know whether it can be brought into practice, so I don't know
        whether to be optimistic or pessimistic. If it turned out to
        work, and was very efficient, it would he very significant." </p>
      <p>Mr Marks said he believed Lumeloid would be available for
        commercial use within two or three years. He added that Lepcon
        and Lumeloid could be used to create lasers, an application he
        said he had discussed with the Pentagon in conjunction with
        Westinghouse. </p>
      <p>Mr Marks conceded that getting his ideas to the major prototype
        stage would cost around $5 million. Commercial production of
        solar panels would cost between $30 million to $5O million, he
        estimated, and the preliminary work, supported by Westinghouse,
        is now underway, he said. </p>
      <p>Phototherm plans a $15 million initial public stock offering
        soon to help subsidize development of the solar patents. </p>
      <p>Mr Marks has more than 100 other patents, Including the film
        used on polarized sunglasses, and the process to make 3D movies,
        and he was also an energy adviser to president John F. Kennedy.

      <p>Dr. Alvin Marks receives patents for two solar power
        technologies: Lepcon and Lumeloid. Lepcon consists of glass
        panels covered with millions of aluminum or copper strips, each
        less than a thousandth of a millimeter wide. As sunlight hits
        the metal strips, light energy is transferred to electrons in
        the metal, which escape at one end in the form of electricity.
        Lumeloid is similar but substitutes cheaper, film-like sheets of
        plastic for the glass panels and covers the plastic with
        conductive polymers </p>

      <p>February 19,1992 --- This information package is about an
        invention by Alvin M. Marks to convert sunlight to electric
        power. A few years of Research and Development are required to
        bring the thin film photovoltaic called Lumeloid (tm) into
        production. Alvin M. Marks was on President Kennedy's Power
        Panel and owns 120 patents. He invented Polarized film
        materials, 3D movie technology and co-founded Marks Polarized
        Corporation. He received many U.S. Government contracts for
        alternative energy until the early 1980's. Studying the initial
        phase used in the process of photosynthesis, Alvin Marks
        employed his knowledge of polarizing film materials to design
        aligned molecular antennae and molecular diodes to convert
        sunlight directly to electric power. </p>
      <p>Lumeloid's (tm) projected efficiency is 80%, (many times that
        of conventional silicon photovoltaics) with an investment cost
        only a fraction of existing electric power sources. Project
        Lumeloid's (tm) success will revolutionize the electric power
        industry with low cost efficient benign technology. Phototherm,
        Inc., a Public Company, OTC, holds license rights to Alvin
        Marks' light to electric power conversion patents. Advanced
        Research Development, Inc. is privately owned and has an
        exclusive R&amp;D agreement with Phototherm, Inc. </p>
      <p>Project Lumeloid (tm) is partly funded by the Electric Power
        Research Institute with Lowell University preparing special
        materials for Marks' electrically-conducting polarized film.
        More funds are necessary to expedite Research and Development.
        Your support will help bring Lumeloid (tm) into Production and
        enable your participation in a technology beneficial to all. </p>

        <p><b>SOLAR BREAKTHROUGH --- MASSACHUSETTS ENTREPRENEUR POINTS
            WAY TO PROFITS FROM ENVIRONMENTALLY BENIGN TECHNOLOGY</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>In just two and a half hours enough radiant energy from the sun
        falls onto the earth to supply all the energy (from all sources)
        consumed by human civilization in an entire year. The light that
        falls on a few hundred square kilometers in the Southwestern
        desert of the United States is enough to power all of North
        America. The problem, however, has always been how to harness
        it. The rap against conventional photovoltaic cells (which
        convert light into electricity) has always been their cost.
        Conventional silicon- based solar cells convert sunlight to
        electricity at an average cost above US$0.30 per kilowatt hour
        (kwh). That is three to five times what an average U.S.
        household pays for power from the local utility company. It is
        precisely this cost disadvantage that has limited most solar
        applications to small-scale operations in remote areas far from
        commercial power mains. </p>
      <p><b>Massachusetts Miracle</b> </p>
      <p>That is, until now. A 78-year old Massachusetts inventor, Dr.
        Alvin Marks, has come up with a new kind of solar cell that
        promises to produce electricity for less than US$0.02 per kwh.
        If this is true, development of this technology could
        potentially revolutionize the commercial power generation
        industry. After all, conventional power plants are like prisons.
        But nobody wants one built in their neighborhood. On the other
        hand, a solar plant produces no radiation, smoke, or acid rain.
        Moreover, its best location would be somewhere in a desert --
        where nobody lives anyway. Marks' cost breakthrough was achieved
        by radical new design that dramatically increases the efficiency
        of solar conversion. While conventional cells are able to
        capture and convert only 10% to 25% of the sun's energy, Marks'
        new designs may capture as much as 80%. </p>
      <p><b>Dinner With Alvin</b> </p>
      <p>The genesis of this breakthrough was a dinner conversation that
        took place seven years ago between Marks and the then Director
        of the Third World Energy Division of the United Nations, Dr.
        Usmani. After complaining about a photovoltaic test project in
        Africa that had to be abandoned because it was too expensive and
        inefficient, Usmani turned to Marks and said something to the
        effect of `You're an inventor, can't you invent a better
        photovoltaic cell.' Few people would be better equipped to
        accept such a challenge. Marks patented his first invention in
        January 1938. His early work lead to what the May 1935 issue of
        "SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN" termed a 1,000 to 1 cost reduction in the
        fabrication of materials to polarize light. </p>
      <p><b>Polaroid Precursor</b> </p>
      <p>This cost breakthrough was instrumental in the subsequent
        development of polarized sunglasses and Polaroid film. (In fact,
        Marks was an early rival of Dr. Edwin Land, developer of the
        Land Camera and founder of the Polaroid Corp.) In the early
        1960s, Marks was science advisor to the Kennedy White House.
        Today, he holds a total of 120 patents -- a number of which have
        application to solar power generation. Marks new solar designs
        -- dubbed LEPCON (Light to Electric Power Converter) and
        LUMELOID -- are built on an extention of systems commonly used
        to receive microwave transmissions. (On the spectrum of
        electromagnetic energy, the difference between microwaves and
        visible light is merely that the latter have a higher frequency
        and a shorter wavelength.) Microwaves -- like other radio
        frequency transmissions -- are best received using an antenna
        tuned to the wavelength of the incoming signal. (When an
        electromagnetic wave strikes an electrically conductive
        material, it induces an alternating current of the same
        frequency of the incoming wave.) In real-world microwave
        applications, the efficiency of this connversion approaches 80%.
        LEPCON consists of millions of microscopic antennas (tuned to
        the wavelengths of the visible spectrum) embedded in a glass
        substrate. (LUMELOID use less expensive plastic materials.) </p>
      <p><b>A Thousand Points Of Light</b> </p>
      <p>With microwaves (as well as with radar and radio), however, the
        same tuned antenna will work as well for transmitting a signal
        as it does for receiving it. Operate LEPCON in reverse and it
        becomes a light source. Marks calls this reverse application
        ELCON (Electricity to Light Converter). ELCON elements in a
        group become a point of light, or a pixel. Page 3 The same
        technology used to pack millions of submicron antenna elements
        in a glass or plastic substrate could be used to produce a new
        kind of high-definition TV (HDTV) screen with much higher
        resolution than present technology will allow. Conventional U.S.
        TV uses 525 scanning lines of pixels per screen. The most
        ambitious HDTV schemes yet proposed would use something on the
        order of 1,250 lines per screen. Using ELCON technology, screens
        using millions of lines may be possible -- for an 80,000%
        increase in resolution. </p>
      <p><b>Phototherm, Inc.</b> </p>
      <p>Virtually all these ideas and devices have been patented by
        Marks. But lack of funds for the development of commercial
        prototypes has been a serious and continuing obstacle. To get
        LUMELOID off the ground, Marks formed a public company.
        Phototherm Inc. (OTC-pink sheets). However, it is still some
        distance away from a commercial product. Marks estimates an
        additional US$300,000 - US$500,000 will be necessary to get
        LUMELOID to the prototype stage. While North American interest
        in solar power has been sliding along with oil prices since the
        late 1970s, that has not been the case elsewhere. Last year,
        Marks made a deal with a Chinese company, China Petroleum
        Engineering Construction Corporation, to develop the LUMELOID
        prototype. Phototherm Bahamas Ltd. has been established to
        facilitate this endeavor and Chinese citizens will come to the
        Bahamas to learn the process. </p>
      <p><b>Genius And Fortune</b> </p>
      <p>Because of the enormous breadth and depth of Marks' work, the
        "TAIPAN" research department believes no 20th century
        entrepreneur or inventor is destined to have greater positive
        effects on the daily lives of millions of people. However,
        revolutionary ideas are not any guarantee of quick commercial
        success. Because so much work remains before any of these
        ventures are likely to reach the stage of a profit-making
        enterprise, we suspect that attractive returns on Phototherm
        shares may be distant enough to try the patience of all but the
        most tenacious investors. However, if war in the Persian Gulf
        leads to destruction of the Saudi oil fields, we think promising
        technologies such as LEPCON and LUMELOID would suddenly become
        clear leaders on the fast track to commercial development. In
        the meantime, however, investors and entrepreneurs in search of

      <p>Would you pay 25 cents for a share of a solar technology for
        which Exxon offered $9 million? That's the current price of
        Phototherm Inc., an Athol, Massachusetts, solar technology
        company which is developing a new ultra-efficient process of
        harnessing the sun's power. The founder and brains behind
        Phototherm is Dr. Alvin M. Marks, an octogenarian inventor and
        entrepreneur whose resume reads like an award ceremony. Dr.
        Marks is the holder of 120 patents, has degrees from Cooper
        Union Institute of Technology, Harvard University, and M.I.T.,
        and has served as a scientific advisor to the Kennedy
        Adminstration. His work on polarizing film built Marks Polarized
        Corp. into a multimillion dollar business. </p>
      <p>Eight years ago Dr. Marks turned his full attention to
        improving the efficiency of solar (photovoltaic) electricity.
        His work lead to a patent (the one for which Exxon offered $9
        million, according to a 1986 "NEW YORK TIMES" report) that
        claims to convert sunlight to energy at 80% efficiency -- a cost
        of one to two cents per kilowatt hour. That's less than a fifth
        of the present cost of energy from fossil fuels and about one
        twentieth the cost of current photovoltaic systems (which are
        lucky to achieve 15 percent efficiency). The cost breakthrough
        is so incredible, that some skeptics immediately dismiss Dr.
        Marks. But Dr. Marks has made dramatic -- almost unbelievable --
        improvements in light technology before. The May 1935 issue of
        "SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN" noted Marks created a 1,000-to-1 cost
        reduction in the fabrication of materials to polarize light. His
        work with Phototherm has also impressed the Electric Power
        Research Institute, the electric industry's research thinktank.
        The EPRI recently backed Phototherm with $100,000 and has plans
        to add another $100,000 soon. Before you mortgage the house and
        whip out the checkbook, keep in mind that Phototherm is a highly
        risky investment. And I emphasize the word highly. Even though
        Dr. Marks is supremely confident his technologies will work, it
        has never been tested in commercial production. Dr. Marks is
        also eighty-one years old. Even if his patented design is indeed
        revolutionary technology, until Phototherm has enough money to
        hire a team of highly qualified research assistants, it may be
        difficult to carry on his work should he become ill (his health
        is excellent). Interest generated from a recent "BUSINESS WEEK"
        story on Phototherm may help get the company adequately
        financed, but until the cash comes through Dr. Marks must
        concentrate on raising money instead of science and building
        prototypes. Consider investing in Phototherm as you would give
        money to environmental groups -- with the kicker that if it does
        work out you'll get back a lot more than just clean air.

      <p>It's not that there's a shortage of energy. In just two and a
        half hours, enough sunlight falls on the Earth to supply all of
        mankind's energy needs -- heat, light, cooking, transportation,
        industry and every other energy-using activity -- for a full
        year. It's there, the hard part is catching it. Finding a
        practical and economical way to harness all that free,
        ubiquitous energy has challenged scientists and engineers since
        the energy crisis of the early 1970s awakened interest in
        alternative power sources. No major breakthroughs emerged during
        the 70s, but researchers say new methods developed in the last
        few years, and innovations just now emerging from the
        laboratories, will make solar power -- which is already
        competitive in some applications -- an increasingly important
        contributor to the world's energy supply. Most people in the
        solar energy field expect it will "really take off in about 1993
        to 1995," said electrical engineer Richard Swanson of Stanford
        University, who has developed what are presently the world's
        most efficient solar cells. For a home or farm in remote areas
        not served by power lines, a solar-power system "right now is
        cost-effective against a diesel- power system," the present
        standard in small electric generators, according to Satyen Deb,
        manager of photovoltaic research for the federally-funded Solar
        Energy Research Institute in Colorado. And solar cells have
        always played an important role in the space program; they are
        the standard source of power for satellites and other long-term
        applications. As the US space station takes shape in orbit,
        their role will become ever more important -- especially since
        the only real alternative, small nuclear generators, may no
        longer be acceptable because of fears of what might happen to
        nuclear fuel in the event of a Challenger-type launch accident.
        But solar technology will really take off when it becomes
        competitive with other kinds of power plants that feed the
        nation's electrical transmission grid. "By the turn of the
        century, we should make a strong penetration in the grid
        market," Deb predicted last week. Ways of harnessing the sun
        span the gamut of technology, from the simple to the futuristic,
        and all have a part to play. </p>
      <p>At the simple end, there are already several million solar
        stoves, consisting of dish-shaped aluminum reflectors, being
        used in India. They have made a dent in the problem of
        deforestation -- obtaining fuel for cooking is one of the
        principal reasons for cutting trees in developing countries. </p>
      <p>At the futuristic end, an inventor in Athol has patented a
        completely new kind of solar-electric cell that he says could be
        far more efficient and far cheaper than the silicon panels now
        in use, making solar power practial for everything from
        individual homes and farms to huge solar installations for
        utilities. </p>
      <p>And in between, improvements in silicon solar cells promise to
        bring down costs enough to make this technology competitive with
        other power sources. Prominent among them is the development of
        "amorphous silicon," a glass-like material that can be coated
        onto a thin plastic sheet to replace the expensive pure silicon
        crystals of traditional solar cells. </p>
      <p>Potentially the most exciting development is the solar cell
        invented by Athol-based Alvin M. Marks, a 77-year-old inventor
        with more than 100 patents to his name. If his calculations are
        right, Marks' system could provide all of the nation's
        electrical needs at a fraction of today's cost with the
        equivalent of a single 100-mile- square of solar panels located
        in a sunny desert area -- eliminating the need for coal, oil, or
        nuclear plants with their attendant hazards. Marks, who was an
        energy consultant to President Kennedy, was inspired to develop
        his solar power system during a conversation about the great
        need for solar power in developing nations, where sunlight tends
        to be abundant and power plants scarce. "About five years ago,"
        Marks said in an interview, "we were sitting with an official
        from the United Nations talking about photovoltaics in the Third
        World. He said,`isn't there something you can do to make them
        more efficient?'" Marks agreed to think about it, and before
        long he had concluded there was a way. His first solar patent,
        for a glass-plate collector he calls Lepcon (light to electric
        power converter), was issued in 1984. It was followed in 1986 by
        a patent for a lower-cost, plastic- sheet version called
        Lumeloid. His latest patent on an improved version of the
        technology was granted last month. Although some scientists
        question his figures, Marks says his technology could
        theoretically have an efficiency of 80 percent -- that is, 80
        percent of the sun's power reaching the cell would be converted
        to usable electricity. By comparison, the most advanced design
        silicon cell in Swanson's laboratory at Stanford has produced
        about 28 percent efficiency and available commercial versions
        average about 10 to 12 percent. </p>
      <p>The basic technology of Marks' cells is a modification of
        systems used to pick up microwave transmissions, which do
        achieve efficiencies of 80 percent in real world applications,
        not just in Page 7 the lab. Critics, however, point out that
        microwaves used for communications are all of the same
        wavelength, while sunlight is a mixture of many wavelengths, or
        colors, of light. Marks says he has taken this into account,
        because his cells would consist of millions of tiny "antennas"
        of different lengths, each tuned to a different wavelength of
        light so that among them, they would pick up light of all
        colors. Some critics also question Marks' optimism about how
        quickly the technology could be made practical for manufacturing
        in commercial quantities. Marks thinks one version could be in
        production within two years, while others think it may be quite
        a few years off. No one, however, disputes the principle
        involved, which is based on well-established concepts.
        Conventional solar cells generate electricity with an array of
        tiny transistor-like areas of semiconductor material on a
        silicon chip, which absorb energy from light to break electrons
        loose and send them toward one terminal of the cell, producing
        an electric current. Marks' cells will use an array of even
        tinier metal strips, which serve as antennas to pick up energy
        from light in much the same way that a radio antenna picks up
        energy from radio waves. The current produced in each antenna is
        intially AC, or alternating current, unlike the DC (direct
        current) of conventional cells, but tiny diodes -- one-way
        electrical "valves" -- in the gaps between antennas would
        convert the current to DC. </p>
      <p>Lumeloid, the cheaper but less-durable version of his system,
        is an offshoot of a polarizing filter that was Marks' first
        invention. His was the first man-made material commercially
        produced to polarize, predating Edwin Land's polarizing filters.
        One version developed later by Marks is still in production for
        polarizing sunglasses and 3-D movie glasses. </p>
      <p>Light can be thought of as waves or vibrations, and in ordinary
        light these vibrations move every which way. In polarized light,
        the vibrations all move in the same direction -- vertically or
        horizontally. The production of the polarizing filters, and of
        Lumeloid, seems to have more in common with candy making than
        with the high-tech, clean-room process used to make silicon
        cells. "You make a syrup," Marks explains, of chemicals called
        polymers that form long-chain molecules, suspended in an
        electrically conductive material. "You stretch it like taffy,
        and all the molecules become parallel." In a simple large-scale
        way, this process yields millions of the microscopic chain-like
        molecules all lined up in a neat grid that can filter out all
        the light rays that vibrate in one direction, allowing those
        that vibrate in the other to pass through -- producing polarized
        light. By simply adding a different kind of chemical to the
        recipe -- a "donor- receptor" molecule -- the polarizing filter
        becomes a solar generator, Marks says. </p>
      <p>Marks expects the lightweight plastic Lumeloid, manufactured by
        the "taffy-pulling" method to be the first of his solar
        materials to reach the production stage. If he can raise the
        financial backing he needs He is negotiating with state and
        federal agencies as well as private investors), he thinks a
        prototype could be made in about nine months. "The reason I'm so
        sure about Lumeloid," Marks said last week, "is because I've
        been involved in polarizing material for decades, and the
        materials are not that different." Others are not so sure.
        Elliot Berman, chief scientist for Arco Solar company, a maker
        of silicon cells, said in an interview that "it's a good idea, I
        just don't think he can build it." "It's not that it's
        impossible," Berman added, "it's just not practical at the
        present time. It's pretty far away." Berman conceded, however,
        that he is not familiar with the details of Marks' manufacturing
        plans. Edgar Demeo, head of solar power research for the
        Electric Power Research Institute, takes a middle position,
        saying the Marks system is "an elegant approach to converting
        solar energy" and "is a very nice idea and is worthy of some
        basic research at this point." But, he added, it may take "a
        number of years" to become a commercial product. In the
        meantime, Berman sees other developments that could reach the
        market sooner and make substantial inroads in a variety of
        applications. "I think there are some substantial progress," he
        said. </p>
      <p>Solar cells have dropped in price from about $20 per watt of
        output 15 years ago to about $5 per watt today, and Berman sees
        the new amorphous silicon cells -- especially a version he calls
        "tandem cells," where amorphous (glasslike instead of
        crystalline) cells sensitive to one color of light are paired
        with cells sensitive to another color in order to improve
        efficiency -- cutting that price in half within the next two and
        a half years. That would bring it close to the range of other
        power sources, which generally cost between $1 and $2 per watt.
        When that happens, Berman said, solar power will have reached
        the price level "where we think this will be practical for
        widespread use. </p>

        <p><b><font size="+1">Nanoantennas: Solar arrays that absorb
              energy even in the dark!!</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>A collaboration of physicists, scientists and businesses have
        teamed up to create cheap and highly effective solar cells on a
        nanoscopic scale. Spearheaded by the Idaho National Laboratory,
        this team is onto a fresh way of producing solar panels that can
        continue to absorb energy even after the sun has set. The
        technology, not only efficient at nearly 80%, will also be cheap
        to manufacture, at estimated pennies a yard. </p>
      <p>A specialized manufacturing process will stamp tiny square
        spirals of a conducting metal onto a think sheet of plastic that
        have been coined nanoantennas. At the slight width on the
        order of 1/25 the diameter of a human hair, these nanoantennas
        can absorb energy produced through the infrared spectrum.
        Infrared energy is produced in massive quantities by the sun, a
        portion of which is absorbed by the earth only to be released as
        radiation after the sun has set. These nanoantennas can absorb
        energy from both the rays of the daylight sun and the heat
        radiated from the earth at a higher efficiency than modern solar
        cells. </p>
      <p>Steven Novak, a physicist at the Idaho National Laboratory
        spoke on this technology he is working on at the National Nano
        Engineering Conference in Boston. He said, I think these
        antennas really have the potential to replace traditional solar
        panels. </p>
      <p>The technology simply mimics that of your cell phone or
        television antenna, absorbing energy by resonance. The theory
        that has born the research to produce these nanoantennas was
        based upon this platform; just make an antenna small enough to
        absorb the miniscule wavelengths produced by electromagnetic
        radiation. </p>
      <p>The technology behind these atomic sized power modules is
        nothing new, but it has taken many years to discover an
        efficient way to print these miniscule spiraled antennas. It
        wasnt until the inception of booming advancements in
        nanotechnology that this fine concept was taken from the theory
        to the tooling with production of these nanoantennas. The team
        at the INL forecast seeing the antennas produced akin to that of
        foil or plastic wrap in rolls of highly efficient solar cells.
        The team has been able to demonstrate an imprinting process with
        six-inch circular stamps, with each stamp containing more than
        10 million antennas. </p>
      <p>Instead of pairing this technology up with conventional solar
        cells to give them a boost in efficiency, the developers decided
        instead to make the nanoantennas independent energy harvesters.
        The team has estimated that individual nanoantennas are capable
        of absorbing nearly 80 percent of the available energy bombarded
        onto us daily by the sun. That is a staggering number compared
        to the conventional panels producing at around 20 percent. </p>
      <p>Nanoantennas are not limited to silicon mediums, the circuits
        can actually be made from a variety of conducting metals and the
        antennas can be printed onto very thin and flexible materials
        such as polyethylene. The team has also estimated that the
        nanoantenna arrays can be available for as much as an
        inexpensive roll of carpet. </p>
      <p>Although the physics of one resonating nanoantenna is certainly
        achievable, the trick to making this work lies in the matrix of
        complex vast arrays. The trouble will be in predicting the
        properties and perfecting the design before tackling the
        manufacturing obstacles that lie ahead. Multiple antennas create
        complex and sometimes unpredictable interactions. To jump this
        hurdle the researchers are developing a computer model of the
        resonance in these invisible structures, seeking out ways to
        fine-tune the efficiency of an entire array through tinkering
        with the materials and shapes of the antennas for example. The
        ability to model these antennas is whats going to make is
        successful, because we cant see these things, says Novack.
        They are hard to manipulate, and small tweaks are going to make
        big differences. <br>

      <p>A solid state Quantum high Energy density Storage Or Retrieval
        device known as a quensor, and the trademark ENSOR(TM), having
        an energy density of about 1-15 kwhr/kg, comparable to gasoline,
        or more, is described. A fundamentally new principle is
        employed: A quensor film comprises oriented molecules with donor
        and acceptor groups and with metal layers on its surfaces. A
        dipole electric field may be established in the gap between a
        donor and an acceptor. Electric energy is stored in or retrieved
        from dipole electric fields throughout the volume of the quensor
        film. Electric energy is stored in the quensor film by charging
        the dipole electric fields from an electric energy source.
        Electric energy is retrieved from a quensor film by discharging
        the dipole electric fields and supplying the energy to a load.
        Electric breakdown in the film is avoided because positive and
        negative electric charges in the film are balanced everywhere.
        Busbars attached to the metal layers are connected to terminals
        for charging or discharging the device. The manufacture of a
        quensor film is described. A composite photovoltaic and quensor
        panel for the storage or retrieval of solar-electric energy day
        or night on demand is also described. <br>

      <p>A light polarizing electrically conducting film (32) includes a
        two-dimensional array of conductors stretch oriented in a
        polymer film. The orientation produces gaps in the conductors.
        The film also contains molecular diodes, called diads (24, 24'),
        which bridge a sufficient number of the gaps to permit
        conduction of electricity in the conductors when exposed to
        light. An interdigitated electrode array (37, 38) contacts the
        film. The diads are polarized by light and rotated by an
        electrostatic field (35, 36) applied through the electrode array
        before the polymer film is dried, whereby the diads provide
        unidirectional flow of electricity. The magnitude of the
        electrostatic field is increased, without electrical breakdown,
        by placing the portion of the film, whose diads are being
        polarized and rotated, in an atmosphere of a high-dielectric
        gas. A method for continuous production of the film is

      <p>A bulk process is described which is capable of producing large
        area sheets about 8 micrometers thick having the property of
        light/electric power conversion at extremely high production
        rates (many m&lt;2&gt;/s) at low cost ( DOLLAR 1/m&lt;2&gt;).
        The devices have an inherently high efficiency 60-80% when
        laminated in an assembly to utilize both resolved light vectors.
        A light/electric power converter is described comprising a sheet
        containing oriented dipolar conducting linear structures forming
        an antennae array capable of absorbing light photons and
        producing a unidirectional electric current. These linear
        structures constitute submicron antennae and femto diode circuit
        elements. The individual antenna-circuit elements are
        self-ordered into the linear structure using a bulk process. The
        process utilizes (1) electro-ordering a suspension of elongated
        submicron metal crystals; or (2) molecules capable of absorbing
        a light photon and converting its energy to electric energy; or

      <p>The quantum regime and its properties are described and applied
        in the invention of a diode, termed a Femto Diode, responsive to
        light frequencies. In the quantum regime the conventional
        concepts of electrical resistance, resistive loss, and
        capacitance do not apply. The Femto Diode of this invention
        comprises a submicron metal cylinder acting as a potential well
        for an energetic electron with an assymetric tunnel junction at
        one end and reflecting step at the other end. The energetic
        electron is produced by the absorption in the metal cylinder of
        an energy quanta nu such as a photon in the visible light range.
        The energetic electron travels back and forth without collision
        or energy loss in its own conduction band within the potential
        well until it passes through the junction; whereupon its kinetic
        energy is converted to electrical potential energy at a greater
        voltage on the other side of the junction. This forward current
        is proportional to the input rate of energy quanta; but the
        reverse current is limited by a tunnel junction comprising new
        and novel materials and dimensions. A first terminal is attached
        to the metal cylinder to provide electrons to replace those
        which pass through the junction; and a second terminal is
        attached to the metal on the other side of the junction. The
        Femto Diode of this device has applications in diverse fields
        such as light to electric power conversion, an electric power to

        devices in that it utilizes a plurality of dipole antennae for
        absorbing light photons, employing an alternating electrical
        field of said photons to cause electrons in the dipole antenna
        to resonate therewith and absorb electrical power therefrom,
