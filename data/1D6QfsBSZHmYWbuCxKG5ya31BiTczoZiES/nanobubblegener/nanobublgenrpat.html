      The present invention relates to a nanobubble generator capable of
      improving the efficiency of nanobubble generation as well as
      creating economical profits by increasing productivity through a
      simple structure and miniaturization since the generator is set to
      generate nanobubbles by reducing mixed air up to a nanoscale unit
      through the application of impacts and pressure during a procedure
      of transferring a mixture of the air and water. To achieve the
      purpose, the nanobubble generator comprises a generating unit
      having a transfer passage for the mixed water and applying
      transfer pressure and an impactive load to the water to generate
      nanobubbles. The generating unit comprises: plate-shaped impact
      bodies arranged at intervals in a direction crossing with a
      transferring direction of the mixed water at right angles, and
      including a through hole formed in a part to be penetrated by the
      water; and lattice rings interposed between the impact bodies, and
      forming a transfer space for the mixed water between the impact
      bodies. The impact bodies comprise: a porous mesh including a
      plurality of through holes; and a closing film placed on a side of
      the porous mesh to close the through holes, and including the

      The present invention relates to a method for producing nanobubble
      water. More specifically, the present invention relates to a
      method for three-dimensionally producing nanobubble water,
      intended to output nanobubble water from gas and fluids by
      producing fine particulate bubbles with 10 m or less particle
      diameter using a microbubble generator. To this end, nanobubbles
      are produced by dualizing a nanobuble production part and then are
      interlocked with a single driving part. The single nanobubble
      production part induces release and diffusion of the produced
      nanobubbles in a form of nanobubble water with low pressure for
      short distance. The other nanobuble production part makes the
      produced nanobubbles straightly sprayed out in the form of
      nanobubble water with high pressure for long distance.<br>

      A nanobubble generator and applications thereof are disclosed. The
      nanobubble generator comprises high-speed rotor impellers,

      are disposed at an air discharge end of the air feeding pipe. The

      The nanobubble generator is advantageous in that: (1) the

      alternatively arranged, thus increasing the contact area of air
      and residue liquid to be treated in an aeration reaction tank in a
      laboratory carbon tetrachloride separating system, and increasing
      the treating efficiency; (2) rotational symmetric arrangement of
      the high-speed rotor impellers facilitates uniform distribution of
      air bubbles in the aeration reaction tank so that treatment of the
      residue liquid is uniform; (3) the high-speed rotor impellers are

      efficiency of the bubbles; and (4) the micropore aerators are of a

      The present invention relates to a generator and a generating
      method of ozone nanobubble water which make a water conduit
      connect to a pressurizing water-supplied motor which will
      pressurize water and make water pass a gas inhalator through a
      conduit. Because the aperture of the gas inhalator is narrowed,
      water can pass it fast to cause the negative pressure to inhale
      the mixed ozone gas generated from the ozone generator. Then, the
      mixed ozone gas mixes water elementarily to form the preliminary
      mixture of the gas and water which passes into a container to let
      the mixed ozone gas be dissolved in water completely to form a
      kind of water solution containing high-concentration gas. Then,
      the water solution flows to a relief valve through a conduit. When
      the water solution flows into the said valve and the pressure is
      relieved, the dissolved gas will relief rapidly to form countless
      tiny nanobubble. As the result, the countless tiny nanobubble can
      be used to increase the effect of cleaners for decomposing organic
      pollutants and eliminating microbes and insecticides remained on
      the vegetables or fruits.<br>

      PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED: To provide a method for producing ozone
      water which maintains oxidation power for a long period of time,
      and an ozone generator used for the method.SOLUTION: In the
      apparatus for producing ozone water, an oxygen nanobubble
      generator 2 mixes the swirl flows of water pumped by a pump 8
      through a water introducing pipe 4 with oxygen supplied through an
      oxygen introducing pipe 5 and causes the oxygen-mixed swirl flows
      to collide with each other to produce oxygen-nanobubble water. An
      ultraviolet irradiation part 3 irradiates the oxygen-nanobubble
      water with ultraviolet rays to produce the ozone water containing
      ozone nanobubbles.<br>

      PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED: To provide an apparatus capable of highly
      efficiently and in highly concentrated form producing a liquid
      containing nanobubbles in a large amount using a simply structured
      device. SOLUTION: Gas is sheared to generate nanobubbles and to
      make them penetrate into liquid by injecting the pressurized gas
      into the liquid through a nozzle so as to become a high-speed gas
      stream to generate friction between the gas and the liquid. An
      area of contacting the gas stream with the liquid can be expanded
      while suppressing the decrease of gas stream speed by hitting the
      gas stream against a curved surface so that generation efficiency
      of the nanobubbles is enhanced to increase its concentration in
      the liquid.<br>

      connected via a flow rate regulation valve 10, and the diameter of
