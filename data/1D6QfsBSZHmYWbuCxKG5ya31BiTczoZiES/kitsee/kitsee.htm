      Patent papers recently granted to Isadore [ Isidor ] Kitsee, a
      Philadelphia inventor, covering a process for the destruction of
      insect and germ life harmful to plants and trees, the electrical
      method taking place, to a great extent, of the usual sprays and
      other applications. The process consists of making an application
      of a solution such as saline water where the ground is to be
      treated, and then causing a current of electricity to be passed
      through the soil, whereupon the gas generated will rid the soil of
      germs, larvae, and insects without the least injury to the
      vegetation. Where a larger area is to be treated, it has been
      found desirable to dig shallow trenches at opposite ends of the
      area to be treated, and the electric terminals are placed in
      these. An application of somewhat more powerful current will rid
      the entire area of pests. When the plant itself is to be treated,
      the solution carrying the element is made the electrolyte in an
      apparatus, and the plant sprayed with a solution after
      decomposition has taken place through the action of the electric
      current.<br>

      Inventor:<br>
      KITSEE ISIDOR<br>
      <br>
      My invention relates to an improvement in destroying insects
      harmful to plant life. The method of destruction of such insects
      as carried out to-day may be divided into two large classes: (a)
      The destruction of insects with the aid of chemicals placed in the
      soil around the plant to be protected, as for instance, the
      treatment of grape vines with the aid of bisulfide of carbon
      poured into the holes made in the soil around the roots of the
      plant. (b) The spraying of the plant itself with the aid of an
      insecticide solution, such as arsenites, or the treatment of the
      plant with gases such as hydrocyanid. Each of these methods has
      its drawbacks.<br>
      <br>
      It is the aim of my invention to eliminate the disadvantages of
      the systems of to-day and produce means whereby the obnoxious
      insect$' as well as their larvae and eggs may be destroyed at a
      comparatively small cost and with comparative simple means.<br>
      <br>
      The underlying principle of my invention consists in the
      generation of the insecticide, preferably in the form of a free
      gas or a gas dissolved in a solution with the aid of an electric
      current, and applying gas or gas containing solution in a nascent
      state to the soil or plant infested with the insects, their larvae
      or eggs.<br>
      <br>
      My invention may be practiced either by freeing the soil from
      obnoxious insects or by freeing the plant from same, and I will
      give a few examples whereby a person versed in the art may
      practice my invention.<br>
      <br>
      1. If it is required to purify a comparatively small area of the
      soil in which the plant grows, then the soil is impregnated with
      the solution carrying an insecticide element and this solution is
      then electrolyzed with the aid of an electric current by simply
      inserting electrodes around the area to be purified and connecting
      the electrodes to a current carrying circuit. If the area to be
      purified is comparatively large, then it is preferred that
      trenches be dug on at least two sides of the area and filled with
      the solution to be electrolyzed. It is also to be preferred if
      possible to impregnate the whole area with the solution. Large
      conductors are then placed in the trenches and connected to a
      current carrying circuit.<br>
      <br>
      2. When the plant itself, such as a tree, in an orchard has to be
      treated, then the solution carrying the element adapted to destroy
      the insects is made the electrolyte in an electric apparatus and
      the plant then sprayed with the solution after decomposition has
      taken place through the action of the electric current.<br>
      <br>
      A very simple and economic means of accomplishing this object is
      the following:- On a vehicle is placed a tank suitable to be
      converted into an electrolytic apparatus by filling the same with
      the required electrolyte and immersing therein two electrodes, an
      anode and a cathode. If preferred, the tank may be divided into
      two compartments.<br>
      <br>
      The motive power of said vehicle, if self-driven, is coupled to a
      generator such as a dynamo and to the leads of the dynamo are
      connected the two electrodes. The vehicle is moved to the required
      tree, and if an truck is used, the dynamo is uncoupled when moving
      about and is then placed in action and currents of electricity are
      sent through the electrolytic apparatus thereby electrolyzing the
      solution and freeing the element adapted to destroy the insect
      either in the form of a gas or in the form of a gas bearing
      solution.<br>
      <br>
      Different materials may be used for the purpose indicated and I
      will here only enumerate a few chemical compounds well adapted to
      electrolyzing and generating through electrolyzation the germicide
      gases:-common salt, chloride of sodium, (NaCl.) If salt is used,
      then through the electrolytic action chlorin is generated in the
      positive compartment or in the region of the positive electrode,
      and this chlorine, either in its gaseous state or dissolved in a
      liquid is one of the best insecticides not only for the spraying
      of the plant itself but also for the purpose of purifying the soil
      in which the root is growing.<br>
      <br>
      In making use of the electrolyte either the contents of positive
      compartment alone may be used or the same may be mixed with the
      contents of the negative compartment which then contains a
      hydrated oxide of sodium.<br>
      <br>
      Ammonium compounds are well adapted for the purpose in question as
      they not only act as an insecticide after electrolyzation but also
      enrich the soil and act substantially as a fertilizer. Of these
      compounds the cheap carbonate of ammonium, chloride. of ammonium,
      nitrate of ammonium, as well as any of the sulfates may be used
      for the reason that the free ammonia, (NH3) is a germicide in
      itself and yet will act, when combined with moisture of the soil,
      as an enricher of same. It was found that in selecting the
      compounds to be electrolyzed it is best to select such compounds
      as will give in the negative compartment a strong alkaline
      reaction. It is impossible to give it strict rule as to the
      character and strength of the electrolyte when used as the nature
      of the plant, the nature of the soil, and the species of the
      insects has to be taken into consideration.In some cases where the
      nature of the plant or the nature of the seed does not allow the
      application of : an. alkaline solution, the; soil may be
      impregnated with salts of metals, such even as a salt of iron or
      copper, and the compound then electrolyzed. In all cases it is
      best to apply the electrolyzation either in the early spring or
      the late fall. Persons versed in the art, will readily find the
      exact time and exact compound necessary for each particular case.
      In a great many cases where the electrolysis is applied to the
      soil it is best to .apply thereto two separate operations and in
      the second operation the current should be reversed and the
      electrode formerly used as anode should be made the cathode and
      vice versa. This second operation may be made after the soil is
      again saturated with a fresh solution.This. second operation is
      necessary in some localities as otherwise a great part of the area
      treated would only receive the catholyte. With this my invention,
      if the same is carefully carried out, the most obnoxious insects,
      such as weevils in cotton fields, or scales on fruit trees, can be
      successfully destroyed. The only caution that is necessary is to
      so adjust the strength;of the electrolyte that the root of the
      plant shall not be injured if the insects are to be treated in the
      soil.<br>
      <br>
      To illustrate some forms my invention may take I have recourse to
      the accompany. drawing,' in which : Figure 1 is a partial
      sectional and partial diagrammatic view and Fig. 2 is a partial
      side elevation and partial diagrammatic view embodying my
      invention in different forms.<br>
      <br>
      In Fig. 1, the soil or ground is indicated . by the numeral L The
      soil is supposed to be impregnated with the solution containing
      the insecticide in chemical combination. 2 and 3 are the
      electrodes; 4 the source of electric current, here shown as a
      battery, connected with the interposition of switches to the
      electrodes.<br>
      <br>
      In Fig. 2 the truck is indicated by the numeral 5, the motive
      power by 6, the generator of electricity or dynamo by 7, the
      electrolytic apparatus by 8, the electrolyte by 9; the electrodes
      by 10 and. the means to carry the electrolyte to the desired point
      by 11.<br>
      <br>
      I may state here that the process as outlined for the soil is also
      very efficient for the destruction of the eggs or larvae of the
      mosquito or alike insects. In this case a quantity of salt is
      added to the pool wherein the eggs or larvae abound and then
      electric current is applied for the purpose of electrolyzing the
      salt, if such is used.<br>
