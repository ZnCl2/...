      <br>
      Electromagnetic generators of the electromagnet type enabling to
      use a single magnetic pole without having to separate one of the
      two poles from a solenoid. It comprises, according to figure 1: an
      insulating hollow core (1) on which are wound nodal turns (2) with
      a single geometrical pole occupied by a sphere of magnetic alloy
      (3). Said sphere is secured to the pole by an insulating disk (4)
      situated in the medial plane of the core. Amongst the most
      interesting applications of the invention, it may be mentioned the
      nuclear fusion, the spatial propulsion, the production and
      transformation of electric power.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention relates to a monopolar electromagnet having
      the peculiarity of presenting only one magnetic pole either north
      or south.<br>
      <br>
      The other known devices of this type are all generators of a
      north-south bipolar magnetic field produced by a metal solenoid,
      wrapped around a cylinder, traversed by an electric current. Such
      devices are associated magnetic poles without the possibility of
      isolating them separately.<br>
      <br>
      The monopolar electromagnet according to the invention makes it
      possible to avoid this disadvantage. It is indeed a generator of a
      single-pole magnetic field because of the ambidextrous nodal
      geometry of the electrical circuit.<br>
      <br>
      According to a first variant, the electric current flows in
      straight nodal turns (FIG. 5) wound around a hollow torus of
      insulating material.<br>
      <br>
      According to a second variant, the electric current flows in nodal
      turns of left-hand shape wound around (FIG. 3) of a hollow torus
      of insulating material.<br>
      <br>
      The device according to the invention makes it possible, depending
      on the flow of the electric current (either dextrorotatory or
      levorotatory) in the nodal turns of right or left shape, to
      produce a monopolar magnetic field isolated either north (FIG. 2),
      the pole of which can be occupied by a magnetic sphere.<br>
      <br>
      The drawing (FIG. 1) is a top view of the device with the
      left-hand turns and the induction sphere which amplifies the
      monopolar magnetic field.<br>

      <br>
      As shown, the device comprises an insulating hollow torus 1 on
      which the electrically conductive turns 2 are wound in the form of
      a node.<br>
      <br>
      On the other hand, the magnetic induction sphere 3 is held at the
      pole by an insulating disk 4 itself fixed to the median plane of
      the torus 1 supporting the nodal turns 2.<br>
      The device according to the invention can be used in cases where
      it is necessary to use the electromagnetic energy on a single
      magnetic pole. In particular, it can be used as an electrodynamic
      generator by simple rotation about the axis of symmetry of the
      toroid.<br>
      <br>
      The applications are in the field of the laboratory and the
      electrical industry: electromagnet, motor, transformer, resonator.<br>

          <b>Nodal electromagnet with a toric core</b><br>
        </font></div>
      <br>
      The present invention relates to a toroidal electromagnet composed
      of a magnetic induction ring on which is wound a coil in loops of
      pentagonal shape.<br>
      <br>
      Previously, the nodal coil used a triangular loop shape wound on a
      hollow torus isolate constituting the "monopolar electromagnet"
      with magnetic induction core of spherical shape.<br>
      <br>
      The device according to the invention makes it possible to solve
      the disadvantage of the magnetic induction sphere, The spherical
      geometry produced an axis of symmetry in the asymmetrical magnetic
      field.<br>
      <br>
      The invention makes it possible to solve this disadvantage by
      replacing the spherical induction core separated from the nodal
      coil by an inductive ring surrounded directly by the nodal coil;
      Which has the effect of increasing the intensity of the magnetic
      field at the central focus as well as of increasing the power of
      the magnetic field produced while retaining the properties of the
      asymmetrical magnetic field in the space surrounding the
      electromagnet.<br>
      <br>
      The device according to the invention makes it possible to solve
      the disadvantage of the spacing of the loops in the triangular
      coil and its length which limits the intensity of the magnetic
      field. As a result, the five-loop pentagonal winding increases the
      power of the magnetic field by increasing the length of the wound
      wire at each revolution around the magnet.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Toroidal magnetic core.</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      On the other hand, this pentagonal coil makes it possible to
      constrict the magnetic field lines around the focus by a stencil
      effect related to the pentagonal geometry of this magnetic field.<br>
      <br>
      The invention comprises a toroidal magnetic core (N1, N2) on which
      is wound an electrical circuit in nodal coil of pentagonal shape
      constituted by five loops (A, B).<br>
      The invention comprises an ambidextrous nodal coil (A, B) wound on
      the toroidal magnetic core - either the nodal coil is constituted
      by five loops in the right-hand nodal shape (A) - or the nodal
      coil is constituted by Five loops in the nodal shape "left" (B).<br>
      <br>
      The assembly constitutes the coil with a nodal topology whose
      asymmetry produces an ambidextrous electrical circuit.<br>
      <br>
      <div align="center"><img src="fr2683380.JPG" alt="FR2683380a"
          width="250" height="589"><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      The device according to the invention comprises two embodiments
      due to the ambidextrous nodal coil which will constitute two forms
      of the electromagnet - either by the nodal "right" coil (A) which
      will produce the electromagnet (FIG. 1) or by the left-hand nodal
      coil (B) which will produce the electromagnet in its left form
      (FIG. 2).<br>
      <br>
      According to a first variant, the electric current flows in the
      nodal coil with five right-handed loops (A) wound around the
      toroidal magnetic induction core (FIG. 1) in order to produce an
      asymmetrical magnetic field of "right" .<br>
      <br>
      According to a second variant, the electric current flows in the
      nodal coil with five left-handed loops (B) wound around the
      toroidal magnetic core (FIG 2) to produce an asymmetrical magnetic
      field of "left" geometric configuration.<br>
      <br>
      The invention constitutes a whole in which asymmetry produces two
      geometrical shapes with two ambidextrous configurations which are
      mirror image (FIG. 1, Fig.2). These two variants of Nodal
      Electro-Aimat Toric Core - with nodal coil with five loops - allow
      to produce two asymmetrical magnetic fields with two ambidextrous
      configurations "right" and "left".<br>
      <br>
      These two variants allow the production of these two asymmetric
      magnetic fields characterized by an intensity and a power -
      proportional to the length of the winding wire - in particular a
      five-loop pentagonal nodal winding - wound with each rotation of
      the toroidal magnetic core - Proportional to the magnetic
      induction in the toroidal induction core and at the magnetization
      intensity in the toric volume.<br>
      <br>
      The invention makes it possible to produce two magnetic fields
      whose torsion lines form two ambidextrous vortices which converge
      towards a focal point (which is the geometrical center of the
      torus constituting the magnetic induction core) Effect of magnetic
      striction particular to the five magnetic lobes produced by the
      pentagonal winding in; Five loops of the nodal electrical circuit.<br>

      The invention relates to an electrical and electronic oscillating
      circuit which operates as a single electromagnetic wave generator
      assembly. The two component parts of the oscillating circuit are
      geometrically combined in the same space around the toric
