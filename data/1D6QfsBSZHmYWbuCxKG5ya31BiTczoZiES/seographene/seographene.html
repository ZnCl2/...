      <b><br>
      </b>Thermal chemical vapour deposition techniques for graphene
      fabrication, while promising, are thus far limited by
      resource-consuming and energy-intensive principles. In particular,
      purified gases and extensive vacuum processing are necessary for
      creating a highly controlled environment, isolated from ambient
      air, to enable the growth of graphene films. Here we exploit the
      ambient-air environment to enable the growth of graphene films,
      without the need for compressed gases. A renewable natural
      precursor, soybean oil, is transformed into continuous graphene
      films, composed of single-to-few layers, in a single step. The
      enabling parameters for controlled synthesis and tailored
      properties of the graphene film are discussed, and a mechanism for
      the ambient-air growth is proposed. Furthermore, the functionality
      of the graphene is demonstrated through direct utilization as an
      electrode to realize an effective electrochemical genosensor. Our
      method is applicable to other types of renewable precursors and
      may open a new avenue for low-cost synthesis of graphene films...<br>
      <br>
      Here we present a single-step, rapid thermal synthesis of uniform
      and continuous graphene films in an ambient-air environment, using
      a cheap and renewable form of biomass, soybean oil, as the
      precursor. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time
      that the synthesis of graphene film has been demonstrated in an
      ambient-air environment without any compressed gases. Graphene
      derived from this unique ambient-air process exhibits good and
      tuneable film properties, which are comparable to those of
      graphene synthesized with conventional methods 2,11. This
      ambient-air process for graphene fabrication is fast, simple,
      safe, potentially scalable and integration-friendly. Importantly,
      it offers the scope to potentially address the critical roadblocks
      towards large-scale, efficient graphene manufacturing.<br>
      <b><br>
      </b><b>Controlled synthesis of graphene in ambient-air environment</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Currently, graphene synthesis involves several key factors need to
      be improved: (i) lengthy high-temperature annealing processes to
      increase the grain size of the metal catalyst used to form
      graphene; (ii) utilization of purified and compressed gases to
      offer a homogenous and controlled delivery of carbon source
      materials; and (iii) the use of lengthy vacuum operation to avoid
      the presence of any detrimental reactive oxygen species from air
      2,4. To overcome these problems, we have designed a thermal CVD
      process to produce graphene in an ambient-air environment that is
      completely free of compressed or purified gases and requires
      minimum processing time.<br>
      <br>
      The process is schematically illustrated in <b>Fig. 1a</b>, in
      which the precursor for graphene growth and a metal catalyst (for
      example, Ni foil) are placed close together inside the heating
      zone of a furnace, before heating the quartz tube. The quartz tube
      is then sealed and the temperature is increased. During the
      ramping stage, air inside the quartz tube is released through a
      valve to maintain atmospheric pressure. Once the annealing stage
      is complete, the sample is removed from the heating zone for rapid
      cooling. Raman spectra of the samples grown at 800°C in the
      ambient-air process indicated the presence of single-to-few layer
      graphene films covering the surface of the growth substrate<b>
        (Fig. 1b).</b><br>
      <br>
      <b>Fig1b</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      In the standard operation, the catalyst is low-cost
      polycrystalline Ni foil. Graphene growth occurs by thermal
      reforming of a natural precursor, soybean oil, in a closed
      ambient-air environment. Unlike conventional CVD methods or
      conventional natural precursor methods for growing graphene, the
      technique does not require any purified gases 8,9. Moreover,
      expensive vacuum processing is avoided. The natural precursors
      substituted for purified gases are cheaper and safer. By
      restricting the air flow into the quartz tube, the transformation
      of solid-state carbon into carbon dioxide or other gaseous species
      is prevented. By controlling the temperature, cooling rate and
      precursor amount, the process enables the growth of homogenous
      graphene films of good quality. A comparison of the method with
      other CVD processes is provided in<b> Supplementary Tables 1 and
        2.</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The parameters observed to control the quality of graphene include
      temperature, processing time, precursor, substrate and the
      ambient-air environment. Nickel acted as a good catalyst for the
      breakdown of precursor material (in this case, the soybean-oil
      molecules) into smaller building units that are essential for the
      synthesis of graphene 12.<br>
      <br>
      To investigate how the transformation occurred in the process, we
      have analysed the chemical composition of the annealed soybean
      oils at different temperatures<b> (Supplementary Fig. 1)</b>.
      During the early stages of the annealing process, for instance at
      300°C, the long carbon chains in the soybean oil precursor were
      thermally dissociated into gaseous carbon building units such as
      methyl and ethyl species <b>(Supplementary Fig. 1a)</b>. Other
      gaseous species were also generated, including hydrogen, water,
      hydroxyls and carbon dioxide, as confirmed by mass spectrometry<b>
        (Supplementary Fig. 1b and c)</b>. Traces of heavier
      hydrocarbons such as propane were also observed. Most of the oil
      was vapourized by about 425°C and a rapid mass reduction of the
      oil was observed by thermogravimetric analysis below 500°C
      (Supplementary Fig. 1d). These building units present in the
      vapour can diffuse through the tube during the heating stage. As
      the temperature gradually increases to 800°C, these carbon
      building units begin to dissociate into carbon atoms and dissolve
      into the Ni bulk. The sample was annealed for 3?min at 800°C to
      promote dissolution of carbon atoms in the Ni substrate. Finally,
      following the rapid cooling stage, carbon segregates from the bulk
      and crystallizes on the Ni surface forming graphene 12,13.<br>
      <br>
      At elevated temperatures, long hydrocarbons in the oil decompose
      in the presence of O2 to form water vapour. In particular, water
      vapour can promote the etching of amorphous carbon deposits on the
      Ni surface 14. As such, we did not observe the formation of
      amorphous carbons in our sample. This also helps maintain the
      catalytic activity of the Ni surface in breaking down the
      precursor material 15. Moreover, we have conducted a detailed
      analysis on the consumption of oxygen in the reactor during the
      growth process<b> (Supplementary Note 1)</b>. We found that the
      precursor amount was critical for the consumption of reactive
      oxygen species. In the optimal growth condition, a slight carbon
      excessive environment is used to promote the growth of graphene
      and deter the formation of amorphous carbon. On the other hand, an
      over-excessive amount of precursor material led to an
      oversaturation of deposited carbon in the bulk of Ni, and
      subsequently, the crystallization of graphite on the Ni surface.
      This may explain the resulting formation of thick graphene sheets
      as observed in <b>Supplementary Fig. 2a</b>. Moreover, in the
      case of an insufficient amount of precursor, oxygen species can be
      present in the as-grown product in the form of C–O amorphous
      carbons <b>(Supplementary Fig. 2b)</b>, consistent with the
      aforementioned calculations of oxygen consumption<b>
        (Supplementary Note 1)</b> 16. These experiments indicate the
      critical role of the thermally dissociated precursor materials
      (that is, hydrocarbons) in consuming the reactive oxygen species
      present in the ambient-air environment, which has a profound
      effect in controlling the quality of the as-grown graphene films.<br>
      <br>
      We have also noticed that a slow cooling can promote excessive
      carbon segregation from the Ni bulk, which may account for the
      observed formation of a graphite-like film <b>(Supplementary Fig.
        2c)</b>. Another parameter that significantly influences the
      growth of graphene in the ambient air environment is the annealing
      temperature. At an annealing temperature of 500°C, an incomplete
      formation of the graphene film was observed<b> (Supplementary Fig.
        2d)</b>. This may be attributed to an insufficient amount of
      energy to dissociate and reform the precursor material (that is,
      hydrocarbon species) required for graphene formation. Conversely,
      at a higher annealing temperature of 900°C, thicker graphene
      sheets were observed <b>(Supplementary Fig. 2e)</b>. This may
      arise from the increased rate of carbon diffusion, segregation and
      graphitization as a result of the elevated temperature.
      Importantly, these parameters allow us to obtain graphene films
      with tuneable average thickness and optical transmission, as
      characterized by Raman spectroscopy and optical transmission <b>(Supplementary



        Fig. 3).</b><br>
      <br>
      It is worth mentioning that graphene did not form on other growth
      substrate materials with significantly lower carbon solubility
      than Ni, such as the commonly used Cu foil. Moreover, we did not
      observe graphene formation on graphitic surfaces such as woven
      carbon cloth <b>(Supplementary Fig. 4)</b>. This suggests that
      the use of Ni (through, for example, carbon solubility, carbon
      segregation ability, catalytic effect, possibility of formation of
      oxide in air) and its interaction with the precursor material play
      a critical role in enabling the growth of graphene films. We also
      investigated the possibility of transforming other types of
      renewable oil groups. In particular, we were able to demonstrate
      the ambient-air growth of similar graphene films from other types
      of triglyceride (carbon)-containing precursors such as butter<b>
        (Supplementary Fig. 5)</b>. As such, this method is versatile
      and may be tailored to transform other renewable carbon-containing
      natural precursors into graphene films...<br>

      <b>Proposed mechanism of graphene growth in ambient-air process</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The growth of graphene in an ambient-air environment may initially
      seem counter-intuitive, as graphene is expected to be destroyed in
      air at elevated temperatures (above 500°C). However, we
      hypothesize that the unique processing conditions promote the
      controlled synthesis of graphene films in an otherwise destructive
      environment. Specifically, the thermally dissociated precursor
      material decomposes in the presence of reactive oxygen species
      from the ambient-air, leading to the formation of water vapour as
      a by-product (Supplementary Fig. 1). The water vapour may help
      suppress the deposition of amorphous carbon, promote the thinning
      of graphene layers and maintain the catalytic ability of the Ni
      substrate in breaking down the precursor material into smaller
      building units necessary for the growth of graphene films.<br>
      <br>
      To better understand the growth process and the possible
      interaction with Ni substrate, we conducted experiments to probe
      the surface composition of Ni foils following treatments at
      elevated temperatures. In particular, we investigated the
      composition of:<br>
      <br>
      Ni foil heat treated in ambient environment without soybean oil,
      where surface oxidation will be prevalent<b> (Supplementary Fig.
        8)</b>;<br>
      <br>
      Ni foil heat treated in ambient environment with soybean oil,
      following procedure as outlined previously for the growth of
      graphene, where surface oxidation may be prevented <b>(Supplementary



        Fig. 9)</b>.<br>
      <br>
      Our XPS analyses showed that when the Ni foil was heated in the
      ambient environment without soybean oil, oxygen was easily
      identified on the surface (Ni:O ratio of 1:1.83). However, when
      the Ni foil was heated with soybean oil, the oxygen content was
      significantly reduced (Ni:O ratio of 2.69:1). These results
      indicated that the breakdown of soybean oil in the reaction
      chamber provided a reaction pathway for the consumption of O2,
      which consequently limited the surface oxidation of Ni at elevated
      temperatures.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, we propose a growth mechanism based on these supporting
      evidences. First, soybean oil thermally dissociates into a range
      of carbon building units, for example, CH3, C2H2 and other
      species, at the ramping stage<b> (Supplementary Fig. 1)</b>.
      During this stage, molecular fragments of the precursor material
      may react with and consume O2 inside the reaction chamber through
      possible reaction routes as outlined in Supplementary Note 1.
      Water vapour produced as a by-product of the consumption of O2 may
      also help suppress the formation of amorphous carbon. The
      formation of water was supported by the observation of water
      condensation at the cool ends of the quartz tube outside the
      heating zone. These molecular fragments may further decompose at
      higher temperatures to provide a source of carbon dissolved into
      the Ni foil. This is supported by the detection of an extended
      nickel carbide peak in the XPS spectra of an etched graphene/Ni
      sample (Supplementary Fig. 9). Then, growth of graphene can occur
      through a combination of surface-mediated growth on the Ni foil
      and precipitation from dissolved species when the sample is
      cooled. The precipitation step is critical as we observed that the
      cooling rate was important to control the thickness of the
      graphene films<b> (Supplementary Fig. 3)</b>...<br>
      <br>
      Graphene films demonstrate excellent functional properties and are
      promising for diverse applications. However, the high cost and
      complexities associated with graphene production impede its
      commercial viability. To this end, we present a novel method for
      the synthesis of graphene films, in an atmospheric-pressure,
      compressed-gas-free ambient-air environment utilizing safe,
      low-cost renewable precursors. This ambient-air method offers
      numerous advantages over conventional thermal CVD techniques for
      graphene synthesis, which critically rely on resource- and
      time-consuming procedures <b>(Supplementary Tables 1 and 2 and
        Supplementary Note 3)</b>. Graphene films with good structural
      and optoelectronic properties were obtained. On average, the
      graphene film demonstrated an optical transmission of ~93.9%, a
      sheet resistance of ~324Osq-1, Raman ID/IG ratio of 0.15–0.25 and
      I2D/IG ratio of 0.95–1.50 and domain sizes ranging 200–500nm. We
      exemplify the essential process parameters (for example, cooling
      rate, precursor content, temperature and so on) to enable
      controlled synthesis and tailored properties of the graphene film
      in the ambient-air process. Further, we propose a mechanism for
      the growth of graphene in the ambient-air process, based on depth
      profiling of the as-grown film, analyses of the ambient-air
      composition in the reaction chamber and reaction pathways for
      precursor reforming into graphene. The functionality of the
      graphene films was demonstrated through its direct integration as
      an electrochemical genosensor, in which sensitive and selective
      bio-detection was realized. Importantly, the ambient-air synthesis
      of graphene films from renewable precursors offers numerous
      advantages and opportunities for future streamlined integration
      into large-scale production infrastructures and the realization of
      diverse graphene-enabled technologies.<br>
      <b><br>
      </b><b>Ambient-air thermal synthesis of grapheme</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The growth of graphene was carried out in a thermal CVD furnace
      (OTF-1200X-UL, MTI Corp) with a quartz tube (100 cm in length, 5
      cm in diameter). Polycrystalline Ni foils (25µm, 99.5%, Alfa
      Aesar) were used as the growth substrate. The experimental
      schematic is shown in Fig. 1. Briefly, two alumina plates were
      placed in the heating zone of the furnace. One alumina plate was
      loaded with 0.14 ml of soybean oil precursor and the other was
      loaded with the Ni foil growth substrate. The openings of the
      quartz tube were then sealed. The growth of graphene proceeds with
      a gradual heating and fast quenching temperature profile. First,
      the furnace temperature was raised to 800°C at a rate of 30°C
      min-1. This was followed by holding at 800°C for 3 min. After the
      growth step, the sample was immediately removed from the heating
      zone to enable a rapid cooling (at approximately 25°C min-1) to
      segregate the homogeneous and continuous graphene films. Owing to
      the evaporation and thermal expansion of the precursor material, a
      small build-up in pressure within the tube was observed.
      Throughout the heating stage (200 to 800°C), atmospheric pressure
      was maintained in the quartz tube by allowing this build-up of
      gases to exit via the exhaust of the tube. A controlled gas
      environment was created in the tube through enabling the
      circulation of gases produced by precursor evaporation. Following
      the heating stage, pressure within the quartz tube was observed to
      be stabilized at atmospheric pressure. No additional gases were
      introduced into the quartz tube throughout the entire growth
      process.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Transfer of grapheme</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      A poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA)-assisted transfer of graphene
      was adopted. Briefly, 46mg?ml-1 of PMMA (Mw=996,000;
      Sigma-Aldrich) was spin-coated onto the as-grown graphene on Ni
      foil (3,000 rpm. for 1 min). The sample was then dried in open air
      for 12?h. Subsequently, the underlying Ni foil was dissolved in 1M
      FeCl3 in 30 min. The PMMA/graphene film then floated to the
      surface. This was washed several times with deionized (DI) water.
      Next, the PMMA/graphene was lifted off from the DI water bath and
      transferred onto a glass substrate. The PMMA was then dissolved
      with acetone, and the sample was repeatedly washed with DI water.
      The graphene on glass was then used for subsequent microscopy and
      electrical characterization...<br>

      The invention relates to methods for the production of high
      quality graphene. In particular, the invention relates to
      single-step thermal methods which can be carried out in an
      ambient-air or vacuum environment using renewable biomass as a
      carbon source. Specifically, the invention comprises heating a
      metal substrate and carbon source in a sealed ambient environment
      to a temperature which produces carbon vapour from the carbon
      source such that the vapour comes into contact with the metal
      substrate, maintaining the temperature for a time sufficient to
      form a graphene lattice and then cooling the substrate at a
      controlled rate to form a deposited graphene.<br>

      <b>Background Art</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Graphene exhibits unique electronic, optical, chemical and
      mechanical properties. Because of its extremely high electron
      mobility (electrons move through graphene about 100 times faster
      than silicon), very low absorption in the visible spectrum and
      relative flexibility and elasticity (compared to inorganics such
      as indium tin oxide), supported horizontal graphene as an active
      functional material has been revolutionising many fields. For
      instance, graphene is potentially useful for flexible,
      transparent, and wearable electronics, in energy storage devices
      (e.g., fuel ceils, supercapacitors, photovoltaics, lithium-ion
      batteries, etc), in devices for diagnostics and therapeutics
      (e.g., biosensors, bioelectronics, drug delivery), in water
      purification (e.g., point-of-use filtration membranes) and in
      catalysis (e.g., to promote hydrogen evolution reactions). Control
      of defect content, micro-structure, and surface chemical
      properties in the graphene will be critical to maximising the
      potential of graphene in these applications.<br>
      <br>
      Graphene can be produced by a variety of methods. The mass
      production of graphene, which would be essential for widespread
      commercial use, has to date been targeted by a small number of
      general processes, most notably:<br>
      <br>
      mechanical grinding of graphite and dispersion in solution
      followed by self assembly.<br>
      thermal graphitisation of SiC.<br>
      chemical vapour deposition (CVD) onto metal substrates.<br>
      <br>
      Of these three methods, CVD onto metal substrates is the most
      promising, as it produces graphene films of sufficiently high
      quality to allow the potential of graphene to be more fully
      realised. CVD also allows roli-to-roli graphene synthesis. The
      quality of the graphene produced is critical to its ability to
      function as a high performance material. High quality graphene
      possesses a minimal number of defects from the ideal perfectly
      regular sp&lt;2&gt;carbon film, and is also very thin, that is,
      the bulk material produced contains as few carbon atomic layers as
      possible. The qualify of graphene can be expressed quantitatively
      in terms of its electronic and optical performance. A low number
      of defects leads to a very low film resistance, which can
      typically be around 200 Q/sq. Defects in the graphene can diminish
      in-plane charge carrier transport which compromises the promising
      properties required for efficient field-emission, ultra-fast
      sensing and nano-electronics based devices. Very thin films, for
      instance those having only one, two or three carbon atomic layers
      are highly transparent and have a transmittance of up to 97% which
      is useful for optical displays.<br>
      <br>
      Thicker films and graphene in other forms (such as grains and
      coatings) can be useful in other circumstances, such as catalysis
      and filtration. An ability to control the thickness of graphene
      grown is highly desirable.<br>
      <br>
      However, CVD onto metal substrates has some inherent limitations.
      The CVD apparatus itself is complex and expensive. CVD consumes
      very large amounts of power and like other thermal methods
      currently used, requires a low-pressure vacuum environment. This
      means that there are significant capital and ongoing operating
      costs associated with CVD. Also, the cost of vacuum equipment
      increases exponentially with the size of the vacuum chamber which
      limits the manufacturers' ability to scale up the process in a
      cost effective manner.<br>
      <br>
      CVD also requires the use of highly purified feedstock gases,
      which are expensive. The use of gases such as hydrogen for
      substrate passivation and methane and ethylene as carbon source
      gases also means that additional hazard protection also needs to
      be put in place.<br>
      <br>
      CVD also requires relatively long time frames, of the order of
      hours , for the growth, annealing and cooling steps to take place.
      This inherent requirement means that CVD is not readily amenable
      to the rapid mass production of affordable graphene.<br>
      <br>
      The search for new methods of graphene is a very active area of
      endeavour and many researchers are investigating synthetic routes
      to high quality graphene thai are safe, inexpensive and amenable
      to scale up.<br>
      <br>
      For instance, US847Q400 discloses graphene synthesis from chemical
      vapour deposition that take place in low pressure environments.
      However, like conventional methods, the methods disclosed in US
      8470400 require the use of purified gases, high temperatures and
      long processing times. WO2013036272 discloses a crystalline
      graphene and a method for the preparation thereof. This method
      involves very high temperatures and long processing times. It uses
      multiple processing stages and requires harsh chemicals and
      processing environments.<br>
      <br>
      US 81 /829423 discloses the combustion synthesis of graphene and
      carbon nanomateriais. The method operates at very high
      temperatures and high pressures and requires long processing
      times. WO2013066269 discloses the synthesis of carbon
      nanostructures from liquid carbon precursors using chemical vapour
      deposition. However, the methods disclosed in WO2013066269 require
      the use of purified gases, multiple processing steps, and long
      processing times, This snapshot of a handful of current cases
      illustrate the fact thai "state-of-the-art" graphene syntheses
      require high temperatures, long processing times and in may cases
      expensive apparatus and consumables.<br>
      <br>
      It is an object of the present invention to overcome or ameliorate
      at least one of the disadvantages of the prior art, or to provide
      a useful alternative.<br>
      <br>
      Any discussion of the prior art throughout the specification
      should in no way be considered as an admission thai such prior art
      is widely known or forms part of common general knowledge in the
      field.<br>
      <br>
      Summary in a broad aspect, the invention provides a method of
      preparing a deposited graphene comprising the steps of heating a
      metal substrate and carbon source in a sealed ambient environment
      to a temperature which produces carbon vapour from the carbon
      source such that the vapour comes into contact with the metal
      substrate, maintaining the temperature for a time sufficient to
      form a graphene lattice and then cooling the substrate at a
      controlled rate to form a deposited graphene. The deposited
      graphene is for preference in the form of a film, most preferably
      a continuous film. For instance, the invention provides a method
      of preparing a graphene film comprising the step of heating a
      metal substrate (e.g., nickel or copper) and carbon source in a
      sealed ambient environment to a temperature which produces carbon
      vapour from the carbon source and dissolves carbon into the metal
      substrate, maintaining the temperature for a time sufficient to
      form a graphene lattice and then cooling the substrate at a
      controlled rate to segregate the graphene lattice from the metal
      substrate to thereby form a film of graphene.<br>
      <br>
      Unless the context clearly requires otherwise, throughout the
      description and the claims, the words "comprise", "comprising",
      and the like are to be construed in an inclusive sense as opposed
      to an exclusive or exhaustive sense; that is to say, in the sense
      of "including, but not limited to".<br>
      <br>
      As used herein, the terms "segregate", "segregates", "segregation"
      and the like refer to the process whereby carbon atoms that were
      diffused inside the metal substrate lattice precipitate out onto
      the metal substrate surface. The metal substrate may be a
      transition metai substrate, most advantageously nickel or copper.
      The Ni metal substrate is preferred at a purity of 99% and above,
      if Nickel is used, it is preferably in poiycrystalline form.<br>
      <br>
      The metal substrate can be in any suitable form. Most usually it
      will be in the form of a film but it can also be in the form of
      grains, particles or even manufactured articles. When the metai
      substrate is in the form of particles, it is to be understood that
      the graphene exists discretely on the surface of the particles,
      for instance, a metal particle coated with one of more continuous
      layers of graphene.<br>
      <br>
      The carbon source may be advantageously be biomass or derived from
      biomass or purified biomass. The biomass or purified biomass may
      be for example a long chain triglyceride (fatty acid), such as
      soybean oil, or it may be a ceiiuiosic material. Renewable biomass
      may be used. The carbon source may be in any form, such as liquid
      or solid form with liquid usually advantageous.<br>
      <br>
      The ratio of carbon source to metai substrate area is desirably in
      the range of 0.1 to 0.3g of carbon source for each 10cm~ of
      substrate, that is, 0.01 -0.03 mL/cm&lt;2&gt;. For thin films,
      0.01 -0.025 ml/cm&lt;2&gt;is suitable, whereas for thicker films
      0.025 - 0.03 ml/cm&lt;2&gt;or more can be used.<br>
      <br>
      The metal substrate and carbon source are placed adjacent each
      other, so that the metai substrate and the carbon source are both
      located in the one heating zone. The substrate and source are
      placed such that vaporized precursor is able to contact the
      substrate. The ambient environment may be air at atmospheric
      pressure or a vacuum.<br>
      <br>
      In one embodiment, the ambient environment is air at atmospheric
      pressure. Although the present invention is described with
      reference to air, artificially prepared gases or combinations of
      gas that mimic the action of air could be used if desired. Such
      artificial combinations of gases could be used at pressures to
      mimic the effect achieved by air at ambient pressure.<br>
      <br>
      In another embodiment, the ambient environment is a vacuum,
      preferably less than 1 mm Hg. in particular embodiments, it is
      preferred that the metal substrate is nickel and the ambient
      environment is air at atmospheric pressure. Alternatively, if is
      preferred that the metal substrate is copper and the ambient
      environment is a vacuum.<br>
      <br>
      Unlike most methods in the art, the methods of the present
      invention are free from the use of a compressed gas or gases.
      Feedstock gases are not required. In one embodiment the sealed
      environment is contained in any inert container, for example a
      quartz or other dielectric heat resistant container such as a
      quartz, alumina or zirconia tube.<br>
      <br>
      The temperature sufficient to form a graphene lattice is
      preferably in the range 650°C - 90Q&lt;!&gt;&gt;C. The temperature
      sufficient to form a graphene lattice is preferably maintained for
      3 to 15 minutes depending on the purity of the metal foil.
      Maintaining the temperature at around 800°C, for a time period
      between 3-15 minutes result in upto about 19 layers of graphene. A
      shorter time frame can be used to making a single layer of
      graphene. An increased time period can be used to form graphen
      films of 1 -3 layers in thickness, increasing the time period for
      upto 15 mintutes can be used to make graphene upto 19 layers in
      thickness.<br>
      <br>
      If a thicker graphene film is required a higher growth temperature
      is preferred, for example, maintaining the temperature 875°C or
      above, or even around 900°C for a time period between 3- 5 minutes
      result in greater than 20 layers of graphene. Maintaining the
      temperature for a shorter period of time at 900°C is preferred for
      forming graphenes of 20-40 layers. Increasing the time period upto
      15 mintues result in increased layers of graphene of 40 layers or
      more (&gt;40 layers).<br>
      <br>
      Once graphene reaches around about 40 layers or more, it may be
      regarded as a form of ultra-thin graphite. However, it will be
      understood that while the methods of the present invention refer
      to graphene, they also encompass any form of layered or
      multilayered continuous sp2 carbon sheets, such as ultrathin
      graphite, that can be prepared by the method of the present
      invention.<br>
      <br>
      Preferably the substrate is cooled to ambient temperature at a
      controlled rate of 10-100°C/minute. Cooling the substrate at a
      controlled rate may be, for example, cooling the substrate back to
      ambient temperature at a rate of 50-100°C/minute, or
      alternatively, the substrate may be cooled at a rate of
      25-50°C/minute, or 25-40°C/minute, or 15-25°C/minute or
      5-15°C/minute or less than 5°C/minute. Examples include cooling
      the substrate at a rate of up to 18°C/minute or at a rate of up to
      25&lt;!&gt;&gt;C/minute. The method may also further comprise the
      step of decoupling graphene from the substrate.<br>
      <br>
      As used herein, the term "decouple" "decouples", "decoupling" and
      the like refer to the removal or lifting of a formed graphene from
      the underlying substrate to isolate a graphene film. The graphene
      may be decoupled by any conventional means. For instance, the
      graphene may be decoupled from the underlying metal substrate by
      dissolving the substrate in an acidic environment, in particular,
      a nickel substrate may advantageously be dissolved in H2S0 or HCI
      or FeCi3or a copper substrate may be dissolved in any of the
      preceding or HN03. The invention also relates to as-grown and
      free-standing graphene films prepared by the methods of the
      invention. <br>

      </b><b>Description</b><br>
      <br>
      With reference to Figure 1 , the method of the present invention
      is carried out in a sealed container (1) in an oven.<br>
      <br>
      Typically, the container (1) is an inert tube, for example a tube
      made from quartz, alumina, zsrconia or similar. The size of the
      container is chosen so as to be relatively compatible with the
      substrate being coated, that is, it is desirable to minimize the
      amount of dead space in the container. The oven can be any type of
      oven suitable for heating the container to temperaiures of the
      order of 800°C. One type of suitable oven was found to be a
      thermal CVD furnace (OTF-1200X-UL, MTi Corp), which is adapted to
      heat tubular vessels. One example of a suitable tubular vessel is
      a quartz tube of 100 cm length and 5cm diameter.<br>
      <br>
      The method of the present invention involves placing a growth
      substrate (2) and carbon source (3) in relatively close proximity
      to one another in the container. They may be placed directly into
      the tube, or more usually, are placed in inert crucibles (4), such
      as alumina crucibles, prior to placement in the tube. The
      container is then sealed and placed in the oven, or alternatively
      placed in the oven and sealed. When the metal is Nickel, no gas
      evacuation or flushing is required and the atmosphere in the
      sealed container at the commencement of the process is air. An
      ordinary mechanical seal will suffice. There is no need for the
      container to be sealed to withstand significant pressure
      differences.<br>
      <br>
      The metal substrate and carbon source are placed adjacent each
      other. The exact distance is not critical, as long as both the
      substrate and carbon source are within the heating zone. Due to
      the rapid thermal expansion of the vapours from the carbon source,
      the concentration of vapours will be fairly consistent across the
      heating zone. A degree of vacuum can be applied to aid in the flow
      of precursors within the heating zone if required.<br>
      <br>
      Normally, as the distance between substrate and source increases,
      a larger amount of carbon source is required to cover a given
      area. The exact parameters can be readily determined
      experimentally for a given substrate size, carbon source and
      target graphene quality.<br>
      <br>
      The positioning of the carbon source and substrate within the
      container should be such that when the container is in the oven,
      the carbon source and substrate are both simultaneously within the
      heating zone (5).<br>
      <br>
      The substrate is a metal substrate, most desirably a transition
      metal substrate, for example a nickel substrate, it has been
      established by the inventors that there is little advantage to be
      gained from using nickel that is higher than 99.5% purity. 99.9%
      pure nickel or higher are suitable for use in the present
      invention, but they produce no discernible advantage over 99.5% or
      99% pure nickel, which is available at a fraction of the cost of
      higher purity material.<br>
      <br>
      The substrate (2) can be quite thin. One type of suitable
      substrate is polycrystalline Ni foil (25 µp?, 99.5%,) or also
      polycrystalline Ni foil (25 \im, 99%,).<br>
      <br>
      Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that Ni acts
      as a catalyst for the breakdown of hydrocarbon species into
      smaller building units essential for the synthesis of graphene.<br>
      <br>
      Other transition metals can be used with minor modification. For
      instance, while Nickel is a useful substrate under ambient
      atmospheric conditions, Copper can be used as a substrate for the
      growth of graphene by evacuating any ambient air within the tube
      at the start of the process. The remainder of the process is
      otherwise the same. However, regardless of the substrate, the
      methods of the present invention avoid the use of expensive
      compressed gases as required in prior art methods. The carbon
      source can be any source of materia! thai provides volatile carbon
      at temperatures between 2GG-650°C at ambient pressures. For
      instance, animal or vegetable fat in unprocessed form have both
      been found to be useful.<br>
      <br>
      One particularly useful source of carbon is raw soybean oil, which
      is a triglyceride of formula C8H3606. More abundant biomass and
      industrial by-products, for example, cei!u!osic materials, may be
      used. The present inventors have established that there is no need
      to use highly purified material as the carbon source. A minima!
      quantity is used, for example Q.1 - 0.25 mL of soybean oil
      provided sufficient carbon to coat an area of 10cm&lt;2&gt;of
      metal substrate. If a thicker graphene film is required, G.25-0.30
      mL (or g) of carbon source per 10cm&lt;2&gt;of metal substrate can
      be used.<br>
      <br>
      If too much carbon source materia! is used, the graphene film will
      be thick, for instance, graphene films of about 5-10 layers are
      obtained. Similarly, if significantly lower amounts of carbon
      source than is optimal, then graphene formation will not occur and
      amorphous carbon obtained. The furnace temperature is then raised
      to around 800°C over a period of 20-30 minutes. A typical ramping
      rate is from 25-35°C/min). During the ramping stage (~300°C-350°C)
      the precursor is vaporized and the long carbon chains in the
      soybean oil begin to be broken down into gaseous carbon building
      units via thermal dissociation. Those skilled in the art will
      appreciate that the precise dissociation temperature will differ
      based upon the chemical and physical properties of carbon source
      precursor material. Simultaneously, gaseous carbon building units
      diffuse throughout the tube and towards the Ni foii growth
      substrate. As the temperature in the furnace gradually increases
      to 80QX, the carbon precursor is further broken down into simpler
      carbon units for graphene generation on the surface of metal
      substrate. In addition, as the temperature rises the carbon
      solubility in Ni increases and the carbon building units begin to
      dissolve into the Ni bulk. From 500°C a graphitization process
      takes place where carbon atoms are starting to arrange themselves
      in sp&lt;2&gt;configuration. From 500°C to 800°C graphene lattice
      is shaped.<br>
      <br>
      Graphene formation is observed to take place from 650°C, although
      the best quality graphene (in terms of low defects) is obtained
      from about 8Q0°C.<br>
      <br>
      Graphene also grows at higher temperatures Whilst it is
      advantageous to carry out the growth at the lowest possible
      temperatures, it has been found that conducting the growth process
      at 900°C, rather than 8Q0°C results in a thicker graphene layer
      which is less hydrophobic in character. The contact angle at 900°C
      is 140.2° compared to 96.1 ° for graphene films grown at 800°C, so
      by varying the growth parameters the contact angle can be varied
      significantly by an amount up to at least 40° to 45°. Without
      wishing to be bound by theory, it is possible that temperature
      could be dependent on the chemical makeup of the carbon precursor
      chemistry, for instance a simpler carbon chain could enable
      graphene production at a lower temperature.<br>
      <br>
      Once the desired temperature is reached, the furnace is held at
      that temperature, for example, 800°C (for 1 G~15min for 99.5%
      purity Ni foil) to enable growth. Graphene grains enlarge during
      the annealing process. The annealing time can be reduced by using
      lower purity films. For instance, the annealing time can be
      reduced to around 3 minutes if 99% purity Mi foil is used.<br>
      <br>
      Following the completion of the growth period, the tube is
      immediately removed from the heating zone to enable the controlled
      cooling to take place.<br>
      <br>
      Control of the cooling rate is a key step in the process of the
      present invention. During the cooling stage, carbon segregates
      from the metal bulk, resulting in the formation of graphene on the
      metal surface, if cooling is controlled to be too slow,
      graphite-like thick graphene films (&gt;10 graphene layers) are
      obtained. The presence of ambient air during the cooling process
      is also thought to etch the graphene film and helps the formation
      of high quality graphene film of typically 1-3 layers. The use of
      a Nickel substrate does not appear to be adversely affected by the
      presence of air, however, Copper substrates provide more growth of
      graphene domains in the absence of any gas, i.e. under vacuum.
      Substrates that are more susceptible to competing oxidation
      reactions would advantageously be reacted under conditions
      requiring the additional evacuation step. Both the amount of
      precursor and the cooling rate independently affect the resultant
      film, if good quality films of greater thickness than 2-3 atomic
      layers, for instance, 10 or more, 40 or more, or even 100 or more
      layers are required, it is advantageous to increase the amount of
      precursor whist at the same time dropping the cooling rate. The
      thickness of the films is measured by the optical transmission,
      whereas quality is determined by \Gand /3/476ratios which are well
      established Raman spectroscopic parameters for determining
      graphene quality<br>
      <br>
      At a fast cooling rate, typically 25°C/min and optimal precursor
      amount (typically ~ 0.15 mL per 10cm&lt;2&gt;of substrate), thin
      films with 2-3 layers of graphene with good qualityGup to 0.4 and
      /2D/Gup to 2.5) are observed. Reducing the cooling rate to 18C/min
      and increasing the precursor amount (typically -0.2 mL per
      10cm&lt;2&gt;of substrate), thicker films with around 20 layers of
      graphene of good quality (/D//Gup to 0.4 and /2D//Gup to 1.8) are
      observed. Reducing the cooling rate even further, to around
      10C/min and significantly increasing the precursor amount
      (typically - 0.25 mL per 10cm&lt;2&gt;of substrate), gives thick
      films of graphene with around 40 layers with a very high quality
      (/r//Gup to 0.4 and !2D/'IGup to 0.4) Figure 2 shows the proposed
      mechanism for graphene growth, as well as the temperature profile
      of a preferred embodiment of the process. It was observed thai the
      carbon precursor content and sample cooling rate significantly
      influenced the quality of the subsequently produced graphene
      films. In an ambient-air environment, an insufficient amount of
      precursor material leads to the presence of O and N species in the
      subsequent graphene, in the form of C-O or C-N amorphous carbons.
      This may suggest the critical role of the thermally dissociated
      precursor (soybean oil in the invention as exemplified) in
      consuming the O and N species present in the ambient-air
      environment.<br>
      <br>
      It is thought that an excessive amount of precursor material may
      lead to an oversaturation of deposited carbon in the metal
      substrate, which can lead to crystallization of carbon on the
      metal surface before the cooling process. This may explain the
      resulting formation of undesirably thick graphene sheets observed
      when excessive carbon source precursor is used.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      A slow sample cooling rate may, on the other hand, promote
      excessive carbon segregation from the metal bulk during the
      cooling process, and may account the observed formation of
      graphite.<br>
      <br>
      A number of substrates were tested under the same experimental
      conditions used for the nickel substrate. Even when these
      substrates did not exhibit graphene formation, they did show that
      a graphitization process (sp&lt;0&gt;to sp&lt;2&gt;transition of
      the carbon) had occurred. The graphitization process precedes the
      possible arrangement of carbon atoms into graphene.<br>
      <br>
      This observation may suggest the key role of the properties of the
      substrate (such as carbon solubility and catalytic effect) in
      graphene formation. The process for ambient-air growth of graphene
      of the present invention has been successfully applied using other
      types of carbon-containing precursors, including triglycerides
      such as butter, which produced high quality singie-tri layer
      graphene films. It is believed that the method of the present
      invention is versatile and may be tailored to transform other
      renewable and redundant biomasses into graphene films. it is
      important to note that throughout the process, the pressure in the
      container is maintained at atmospheric pressure for the Nickel
      substrate. Throughout the entire growth process, no additional
      gases were introduced into the quartz tube. After cooling, the
      substrate (2) was removed and the graphene (6) grown thereon was
      analysed.<br>

      present invention and the leading articles relating to graphene

      The present method thus provides many advantages over other
      methods, including the ability to use a renewable low quality
      biomass, air at atmospheric pressure and lower temperatures.<br>
      <br>
      The use of lower temperatures and shorter processing times is also
      energetically favourable. As a result, the present invention can
      produce graphene for around 14% of the cost of conventional
      methods.<br>

      The quality of the graphene produced by the methods of the present

      invention produces graphene with a very high transmittance, making
      it very suitable for optical uses. In addition, the resistance of
      the graphene produced by the present methods is very low, meaning
      the graphene is relatively defect-free and highly suitable for
      electronic uses.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention allows for the synthesis of high quality
      graphene films to take place in an ambient-air environment via
      thermal chemical vapour deposition. The absence of a vacuum
      chamber means that the present process can be highly scalable.
      Ambient-air synthesis according to the present invention
      facilitates a streamlined integration into the large-scale
      graphene production infrastructure such as roli-to-roii or batch
      processing required for industrial production.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention allows for thermal-based synthesis in the
      absence of any purified compressed feedstock gases (e.g., methane,
      hydrogen, argon, nitrogen, etc.), which are cosily and/or highly
      explosive. The synthesis technique of the present invention does
      not require any purified feedstock gases, and instead, can utilize
      far cheaper carbon source material such as a renewable biomass as
      the precursor for the synthesis of graphene films. Notably, this
      enables the process of the present invention to be technologically
      sustainable, and also significantly cheaper and safer than
      presently available methods. The methods of the present invention
      significantly reduce the processing times compared to techniques
      presently described in the literature and those adopted by
      industry. The present process involves only a single step, and
      requires significantly less processing time. This is unlike
      existing methods for the synthesis of graphene films, which
      involve sample pre-treatments in purified gas environments at high
      temperatures and much longer processing time.<br>
      <br>
      The present methods are thus safe, environmentally-friendly, and
      resource-efficient technique for graphene synthesis.<br>

      </b><b>EXAMPLE 1. OPTICALLY TRANSPARENT CONDUCTIVE FILM </b><br>
      <br>
      In one embodiment, the controlled growth conditions of the present
      invention could be used to produce a thin (optically transparent)
      graphene film useful in a sensing device. Films of materials which
      are optically transparent in a practical sense are those which
      exhibit optical transmissions of 80 - 100% in the visible
      wavelength range, similar to the transparencies achieved by indium
      tin oxide (ITO) films Growth of Graphene<br>
      <br>
      The growth oi graphene was carried out in a thermal CVD furnace
      (OTF-12Q0X-UL, MTI Corp). A quartz tube was used. Polycrystalline
      Ni foils (25 µ??, 99.5% or 99%, Alfa Aesar) were used as the
      growth substrate.<br>
      <br>
      Two alumina crucibles were loaded into a quartz tube. One crucible
      contained the carbon source, which was 0.1 -0.25 mi_ of soybean
      oil. The other crucible held a square (10cm&lt;2&gt;) of the Ni
      foil growth substrate. These two crucibles were placed close
      proximity within the quartz tube. The tube was positioned so that
      both crucibles were within the heating zone of the furnace. The
      open ends of the quartz tube were then sealed.<br>
      <br>
      The furnace temperature was raised to 8GG C (30 C/min) followed by
      maintaining the temperature for 15 mins for 99.5% purity Ni foil
      and 3mins for 99% purity Ni foil at 800&lt;°&gt;C to form a
      graphene lattice. Following lattice formation, the growth
      substrate was immediately removed from the heating zone to enable
      cooling at a controlled rate (50-100&lt;°&gt;C/min) to allow
      segregation of the graphene lattice from the metal substrate to
      form a deposited graphene.<br>
      <br>
      The pressure in the tube was maintained at ambient pressure.
      Throughout the entire growth process, no additional gases were
      introduced into the quartz tube.<br>
      <br>
      Once cooled to ambient temperature, the substrate was removed from
      the tube and the as-grown graphene film was analysed using
      conventional techniques, as described below. The film resistance
      was very low, 330O ohms/sq using four probe sheet resistance
      measurements and the visible spectrum transmittance was 94.3%,
      Also Raman spectra indicate that graphene is formed with a
      relatively low proportion of defects and being very thin (three or
      less films). These characterisation suggest that this graphene
      obtain from this process is high quality.<br>
      <br>
      The functional properties of the graphene of the present invention
      are also very advantageous, as shown by its ability to act as a
      genosensor, which is detailed below.<br>
      <br>
      A poly (methyl methacryiate) (P A)-assisted transfer of graphene
      was used. 48 mg/mL of PIV1 A (Mw998,000) was spin-coated on the
      as-grown graphene on Ni foil (3000 rpm for 1 min). The sample was
      then dried in open air for 12 hours. Subsequently, the underlying
      Ni foil was dissolved in 1 M FeCI3in 30 minutes. The PMMA/graphene
      film then floated to the surface. This was washed several times
      with deionised water. Next, the PMMA/graphene was lifted off from
      the deionised water bath and transferred onto a glass substrate.
      The PMMA was then dissolved with acetone, and the sample was
      repeatedly washed with deionised water. The graphene isolated on
      glass was then used for subsequent microscopy and electrical
      characterizations. Microscopy and microanalysis<br>
      <br>
      Field-emission scanning electron microscopic (FE-SEM) images were
      obtained by Zeiss Auriga microscope operated at 5 keV electron
      beam energy with an InLens secondary electron detector. Raman
      spectroscopy was performed using a Renishaw inVia spectrometer
      with a laser excitation at. 514 nm (Ar laser) and a probing spot
      size of -1 µp?&lt;2&gt;. X-ray photoeiectron spectroscopy (XPS)
      spectra were recorded by Specs SAGE 150 spectroscope with the IV!g
      Ka excitation at 1253.6 eV. Both survey and narrow scans of C 1 s
      and O 1 s were conducted. Transmission electron microscopic (TEM)
      images were obtained by the JEOL 220QFS TE microscope operated at
      200 kv.<br>

      Optical characterizations Optical images were obtained by an
      Olympus BX51 optical microscope. Transmittance measurements were
      obtained by a Varian Cary 5000 UV-Vis spectrophotometer. A
      graphene area of 4 cm&lt;2&gt;was used, and optical spectra were
      recorded in the wavelengths of 300 - 800 nm.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Electrical four-probe measurements</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Silver paint was applied to the graphene transferred onto glass. A
      graphene area of 1 cm&lt;2&gt;was used. Four-point probe
      measurements were conducted at room temperature.<br>
      <br>
      The topographic characterizations in Figure 3 demonstrate the
      uniformity and coverage of the as- grown graphene. A continuous,
      smooth, and large-area graphene film with good homogeneity was
      observed to cover the entire surface of the Ni foil. The optical
      micrograph in Figure 3(a) indicates an average graphene grain size
      of 30-200 µ??. The large-area of transparent graphene film is
      evidenced by the low-magnification TEM image (Figure 3(b)) and the
      respective electron diffraction pattern (inset). Correspondingly,
      a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) spectra in Figure 3(c) further
      supports the presence of graphene lattices, and TEM
      characterizations in Figure 3(e)-(g) indicate the presence of 1 -3
      graphene layers in the graphene film. Furthermore, the graphene
      films are observed to be continuous across the Ni grain
      boundaries, as evidenced by close-up SEM images which show the
      wrinkled surface of the graphene films. Such morphological
      features stem from the difference in coefficient of thermal
      expansion between graphene and Ni, and indicate continuity of the
      graphene film as these wrinkles span the grain boundary.<br>
      <br>
      The surface of the as-grown graphene was characterized by Raman
      and X-ray photoeiectron spectroscopy (XPS). The Raman spectra in
      Figure 4 illustrate the transformation of the precursor at
      different stages of annealing temperatures. In the Raman spectra,
      three distinct peaks are present, namely, the characteristic
      disorder peak (D-band) at 1350 cm ' , the graphitic peak (G- band)
      at 1580 cm&lt;"1&gt;, and the second-order 2D-band at 2670
      cm&lt;"&gt;' . The G-band arises from the in- plane vibrational
      E2gmode of the sp&lt;2&gt;-hybridized carbon, the D-band is
      attributed to the finite crystallite size effect and various
      defects induced in the sp&lt;2&gt;carbon materials, and the
      2D-band is a second-order Raman spectral feature due to the
      three-dimensional inter-planar stacking of hexagonal carbon
      networks. At low temperatures of 500°C, there is insufficient
      energy provided to breakdown the soybean oil precursor into
      smaller hydrocarbon building units for graphene (Figure 4(a)). The
      transition of graphene quality with increasing temperatures is
      evident (Figure 4(b)), and large area low-defect graphene sheets
      are produced as shown with an annealing temperature of
      800&lt;°&gt;C (Figure 4(c)). A t 800°C, the ratios of Raman
      !ZD/!G-(0.9-2.2) and iG-(0.1 -0.25) indicate the presence of 1 -3
      graphene layers with low defects and a dominant
      sp&lt;2&gt;graphitic structure. These results show that
      temperature is a key parameter which controls the nucleation and
      growth of graphene from the carbon source precursor.<br>
      <br>
      The XPS characterizations in Figures 5(a)-(b) show a single and
      narrow C 1 s peak at the binding energy (BE) of 284.5eV, which
      indicates the nanostructure is made of mostly carbon atoms. The
      survey scan of Figure 5(a) shows a small peak intensity of the C 1
      s in relation to the Ni LMM, and suggests the presence of an
      atomically thin graphene film such that the electron beam may
      penetrate through to the underlying Ni foil growth substrate. The
      corresponding C 1 s narrow scan in Figure 5(b) may be fitted by
      three peaks corresponding to the carbon sp'&lt;'&gt;(BE - 284,5
      eV), sp&lt;3&gt;(BE - 285.4 eV), and the oxygen-attached carbons
      (BE - 286 eV). The graphene of the present invention demonstrates
      high ratios of sfflsp&lt;3&gt;carbons and C/O. This indicates the
      graphene lattice is of high structural quality, and its growth was
      not affected by the N and O species present in the ambient-air
      environment. The optical transmittance of the transferred graphene
      film is shown in Figure 5(c). A peak transmittance of 94,3% at.
      550 nm is observed, and suggests a film thickness averaging 2
      graphene layers. Figure 5(d) illustrates the conductivity
      measurements of our graphene, where a sheet resistance 330 Ohm/sq
      is reported. These results suggest thai the graphene of the
      present invention possesses a low level of defects and a highly
      crystalline lattice, leading to its excellent optoelectrical
      properties which are comparable to if not better than those
      obtained by conventional CVD methods. Thus, our as-grown graphene
      films are highly promising nanomaterials for integration in a host
      of electronic devices.<br>
      <br>
      The method of the present invention can be quite readily scaled to
      larger area sample by simple control of precursor flow to enable
      high quality graphene films of different dimensions to be
      produced, in the case of the present invention, the process for
      preparing a 4cm x 2.5cm strip was readily scaled to a 1 Gem x
      2.5cm strip with no complications or drop in quality of the
      graphene film.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Biosensor device</b><br>
      <br>
      The present invention provides access to large-area, uniform, and
      continuous graphene films. One such potential application for this
      material is in the area of high-throughput electrochemical
      biosensirsg devices. Electrochemical sensing methods for minute
      amounts of nucleic acid samples offer attractive opportunities for
      decentralized genetic testing and a plethora of other preventative
      health technologies, which require portable, cost-effective, and
      low-power readout devices, Neurodegenerative diseases such as
      Alzheimer's disease are candidates for such testing. These
      diseases are becoming more prevalent with the ageing population.
      At present, over 40 million individuals worldwide are affected by
      Alzheimer's disease and this may treble by 2050. Importantly,
      Alzheimer's disease may be best managed with early intervention
      therapies provided it is diagnosed as early as possible. Recently,
      post-transcriptional epigenetic regulations of gene expressions
      have been found to provide highly-valuable serum-based nucleic
      acid biomarkers which may be utilized to enable early diagnostic
      strategies for the disease. Graphene, particularly high quality
      graphene in large sheets as produced by the present invention, can
      be used as biosensing electrode to detect and provide early
      diagnosis for Alzheimer's disease. The graphene produced by the
      method of the present invention was used to prepare an
      electrochemical genosensor for Alzheimer's disease to demonstrate
      the excellent functionality of the graphene films of the present
      invention. The general configuration of the biosensor is set out
      in figure 6. Biosensor device assembiy<br>
      <br>
      The as-grown graphene on Ni foil was treated with a
      low-temperature 02plasma (100W, 7 seconds) to introduce carboxyl
      functional groups on its surface. The sample was placed flat and 2
      cm below the plasma generation zone. The size of each sensing
      substrate was 2 cm x 1 cm. Subsequently, the plasma-activated
      graphene was treated with 0.5 M A/-(3-Dimethyiaminopropyi)-
      W-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) and 0.03 M
      N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide (NHS) in phosphate buffered saline (PBS,
      pH = 7,) for 15 mins. This enabled the formation of active ester
      intermediates via carbodismide chemistry. Next, the surface of
      graphene was washed several times with phosphate buffered saline
      (PBS, pH 7, Sigma Aldrich) and Dl water to remove excess EDC/NHS.<br>
      <br>
      Next, NH2-conjugated miRNAs (probe sequence:
      5'-NH2-GGTGGAGGGGACGTTTGCAGGT-3') were diluted in PBS to 0.2 µ?,
      and 50 µ?_ was pipetted onto the EDC/NHS-ireated surface. This was
      left to incubate overnight in a wet environment and at room
      temperature. Next, the sensing surface was washed with Q.05%
      sodium clodecyl sufonate (SDS) in 0.Q4 M hydroxylamine solution to
      deactivate the remaining carboxyl functional groups and to remove
      non-specificaiiy bound probe miRNAs. Then, 0.01 M Polyethylene
      glycol (PEG) was loaded on the sensing surface to block the
      exposed areas of graphene to reduce further non-specific binding.
      Next., the ibiomarker) miRNA sequence (target sequence:
      5'-CCACCUCCCCUGCAAACGUCCA-3') was dissolved in human serum (Human
      Plasma AB) to obtain dynamic concentrations of 1 nM - 0.1 pM, that
      were pipetted onto the sensing surface. This was ieft to incubate
      at 45&lt;°&gt;C for 20 mins to induce hybridization between the
      complementary probe and target sequences.<br>
      <br>
      Finally, a washing step with PBS/DI water was employed to remove
      remaining non-specifically bounded target miRNAs. To demonstrate
      sensing specificity, a similar protocol was adopted by replacing
      the target sequence with a single-base mismatched miRNA sequence
      (non- complementary sequence: S'-CCGCCUCCCCUGCAAACGUCCA-S'). This
      fully assembled device was then utilized in a three-electrode
      electrochemical ceil for biosensing measurements. Bsoserssirsg
      measurements<br>
      <br>
      The electrochemical measurements were conducted in 10 m FeCN6in
      0.1 M Na2S04at room temperature. A three-electrode ceil
      configuration was employed. The three electrode cell used the
      as-grown graphene on Ni as the working electrode, a Pt wire as the
      counter electrode, and an Ag/AgCI reference electrode ( etroOhm).
      The EIS measurements were conducted in the frequency range from
      500 kHz - 1 kHz, using a BioLogic VSP 300 potentiostat/gavanostat
      instrument. The charge-transfer resistance Rdof the sensor
      following incubation with the target miRNA was expressed as a
      percentage of Rdin the reference (blank) case, which was incubated
      in the human serum medium in the absence of target miRNAs.<br>
      <br>
      The impedance spectra in Figures 6(b)-(c) demonstrate the change
      in electrode-electrolyte resistance (Rc&lt;) at the biosensing
      electrode interface due to selective immobilization of target
      anaiyte. Notably, the device of the present invention exhibits a
      bio-detection sensitivity of Q.1 pM, with device selectivity down
      to single-base mismatched sequences, and a large dynamic sensing
      range (1 nm - 0.1 pM). We define ARctby (Rct- RQ)IR0, where R0is
      the charge-transfer resistance of the reference sample. This
      increase in ARCTmay be attributed to a retarded charge transport
      towards the graphene surface, either through spatial blocking or
      electrical repulsion, in particular, the hybridization between
      complementary genomic sequences induces a build-up of negative
      surface charge, and the repulsion of negatively charged
      ferricyanide ions, which leads to a rise in Rct In addition, the
      device shows negligible response to the non-complementary miRNA.
      This performance is comparable to commercial ELISAs, and other
      graphene-based genosensors reported in the recent literature.
      importantly, the integration of the graphene of the present
      invention as a biosensing platform enables a highly specific
      detection of miRNA biomarkers at physioiogicaiiy-reievant
      concentrations. Thus, this may enable an early diagnosis of
      Alzheimer's disease, which requires the quantification of multiple
      miRNA biomarkers in complex biological environments.
      Electrochemical graphene- based biosensors are advantageous over
      ELISAs and other biosensing techniques, as these either require
      resource-consuming (energy, time) fabrication for bio-defection
      (e.g., fluorescent tags, lithography, electrode patterning, etc.),
      large sample amounts (of miRNA, i.e. extracted blood from
      patient), or multi-staged amplification bioassays to quantify the
      concentration of target analyte. Currently, the one of the main
      drawbacks with integrating graphene for medical sensing is its
      cost for production functional graphene. However, the method of
      the present invention demonstrate that high-quality functional
      graphene films can be grown using a simple, cheap and industrially
      viable technique, and that the graphene can be successfully
      integrated as a genosensor for Alzheimer's disease. The
      high-throughput electrochemical performance of our graphene
      genosensor provides a practical demonstration of the high quality
      of graphene produced by the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      Electrochemical graphene-based genosensors may be tailored to
      different types of other diseases, epidemics, including also
      point-of-care diagnostics for infectious diseases.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 2. CONTROLLED THICKNESS GRAPHENES</b><br>
      <br>
      The growth of graphene was carried out as described for example 1
      , with modification to the amount of graphene and the cooling
      rate. A quartz tube was used. Polycrystaiiine Ni foils (25 µ??,
      99.5% or 99%,) were used as the growth substrate.<br>
      <br>
      Two alumina crucibles were loaded into a quartz tube. One crucible
      contained the carbon source, the other crucible held the Ni foil
      growth substrate. These two crucibles were placed in close
      proximity inside the quartz tube. The tube was positioned so that
      both crucibles were within the heating zone of the furnace. The
      open ends of the quartz tube were then sealed.<br>
      <br>
      The furnace temperature was raised to 800 C (30&lt;°&gt;C/min)
      followed by maintaining the temperature for 15 mins to allow
      graphene lattice formation on 99.5% purity Ni foil and 3mins for
      99% purity Ni foil at 800 C.<br>
      <br>
      After the growth step, the growth substrate was immediately
      removed from the heating zone and cooled at the controlled rate.
      The pressure in the tube was maintained at ambient pressure.
      Throughout the entire growth process, no additional gases were
      introduced into the quartz tube. Once cooled to ambient,
      temperature, the substrate was removed from the tube and analysed.<br>
      <br>

      <br>
      With increased amount of precursor material and decreased cooling
      rate of sample, graphene samples are observed to increase in
      thickness and reduce in defect content. This transition is
      illustrated in Figure 7. in Fig. 7 (a), when a fast cooling rate
      and typically -0.15 ml_ of precursor per 10cm&lt;2&gt;of substrate
      is used, the graphene films demonstrate an optical transmission of
      -94.3%, yiG- 0.1 - 0.33 and l?D/!G- 0.85 - 2.5. These
      characterizations are consistent with good quality graphene films
      of 2 - 3 layers. in Fig. 7 (b), at a reduced cooling rate and with
      typically -0.2 mL of precursor per 10cm&lt;2&gt;of substrate being
      used, optical transmission drops to -58.9%, yiG-0.1 - 0.33 and
      l2D/lG- 0.4 - 1 .6. These properties of graphene film are
      consistent with a film of -20 layers of graphene.<br>
      <br>
      Finally, in Fig. 7 (c), at the slowest cooling rate and with
      typically -0.25 mL of precursor per 10cm&lt;2&gt;of substrate
      being used, optical transmission is -23.9%, lD/lGis - 0 - 0.3, and
      /2D/Gis mostly - 0.4. This indicates a film with - 40 layers with
      low/no defects.<br>
      <br>
      Without wishing to be bound by theory, a slower cooling rate is
      believed to provides more time for carbon to segregate to the
      surface of the Ni foil growth substrate, and an increase in
      precursor amount directly increases the carbon content within the
      processing chamber, and therefore, these modifications in growth
      conditions result in an increased in thickness of the graphene
      films.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 3. HYDROPHOBICITY/HYDROPHILICITY CONTROL</b> <br>
      <br>
      Graphene was grown on a Nickel substrate in accordance with the
      procedures described above. The growth temperature was raised to
      900°C and maintained for a time period between 3-1 5 minutes. The
      results are shown in Fig 8 (a) - (b), which demonstrate Raman
      ratios of yiG- 0.1 - 0.3 and l2D/lG- 0.1 - 0.7, which indicate the
      presence of about 40 layers of graphene films with low/no defects.
      Again, without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believe that
      this may be attributed to an overall longer annealing time and
      faster carbon diffusion rate at. a higher temperature, that may
      allow for more carbon to segregate from the Ni foil growth
      substrate, leading to overall thicker films.<br>
      <br>
      Contact angle measurements for graphene films grown at 9Q0°C had a
      contact angle of 140.2° compared to 96.1 ° for those grown at
      8G0°C. The films prepared at 900°C showed a decreased in
      hydrophobic character compared to those grown at 800°C,<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 4. COPPER SUBSTRATE</b> <br>
      <br>
      The growth of graphene was carried out in a thermal CVD furnace
      (OTF-12QQX-UL, MTi Corp). A quartz tube was used, A copper foil
      (0.025mm, 99.8%) was used as the growth substrate. Two alumina
      crucibles were loaded into a quartz tube. One crucible contained
      the carbon source, which was 0.1 -0.25 mL of soybean oil. The
      other crucible held a square (10cm&lt;2&gt;) of the copper foil
      growth substrate. These two crucibles were placed close proximity
      within the quartz tube. The tube was positioned so that both
      crucibles were within the heating zone of the furnace. The open
      ends of the quartz tube were then sealed.<br>
      <br>
      The tube was then evacuated to a vacuum of less than 1 mm Hg. The
      furnace temperature was raised to 800&lt;°&gt;C (30&lt;°&gt;C/min)
      followed by an annealing for (3 minutes) 800 C. After the
      annealing step, the growth substrate was immediately removed from
      the heating zone to enable a controlled cooling (rate of
      50°C/min).<br>
      <br>
      The vacuum in the tube was maintained until the system had
      returned to room temperature. Throughout the entire growth
      process, no additional gases were introduced into the quartz tube.<br>
      <br>
      Once cooled to ambient temperature, the substrate was removed from
      the tube and the as-grown graphene film was analysed using
      conventional techniques. Figure 9 shows Raman spectral
      characterization of graphene grown on copper foil, made possible
      by modification of growth conditions in our process. The as-grown
      graphene indicated the presence of small graphitic islands, spread
      over the surface of the copper foil growth substrate. These
      graphitic islands indicated film quality of /D//G- 0.6 and were of
      multi-layer thickness (/2D//G~0.5).<br>
      <br>
      <b>Corsdussors</b><br>
      <br>
      The present invention provides a method for synthesis of
      high-quality, large-area, uniform, and continuous graphene films
      of a controlled thickness and hydrophobicity, in an atmospheric
      pressure, compressed gas-free and ambient-air environment. The
      method is highly scalable, resource-efficient, simple,
      single-stepped and environmentally-friendly, and offers numerous
      advantages over conventional thermal CVD techniques for graphene
      synthesis, which critically rely on numerous resource-consuming
      procedures and expensive consumables. These methods offer numerous
      advantages and opportunities for future streamlined integration in
      large-scale production infrastructures. The functionality of the
      as-grown graphene films has been demonstrated by its direct
      integration into a functioning high performance electrochemical
      genosensor for Alzheimer's disease.<br>
