            process</b></big><br>

      <br>
      A low-cost water desalination system developed by New Mexico State
      University engineers can convert saltwater to pure drinking water
      on a round-the-clock basis ­ and its energy needs are so low it
      can be powered by the waste heat of an air conditioning system.<br>
      <br>
      A prototype built on the NMSU campus in Las Cruces can produce
      enough pure water continuously to supply a four-person household,
      said Nirmala Khandan, an environmental engineering professor in
      NMSU's Department of Civil Engineering.<br>
      <br>
      New Mexico and other parts of the world have extensive brackish
      groundwater resources that could be tapped and purified to augment
      limited freshwater supplies, but traditional desalination
      processes such as reverse osmosis and electrodialysis consume
      significant amounts of energy.<br>
      <br>
      This research project, funded by the NMSU-based New Mexico Water
      Resources Research Institute, explores the feasibility of using
      low-grade heat — such as solar energy or waste heat from a process
      such as refrigeration or air conditioning — to run a desalination
      process.<br>
      <br>
      Khandan said the project builds on a process, first developed by
      researchers in Florida, that makes distillation of saline water
      possible at relatively low temperatures — 113 to 122 degrees
      Fahrenheit rather than the 140 to 212 F required by most
      distillation processes.<br>
      <br>
      The system utilizes the natural effects of gravity and atmospheric
      pressure to create a vacuum in which water can evaporate and
      condense at near-ambient temperatures.<br>
      <br>
      Two 30-foot vertical tubes — one rising from a tank of saline
      water and the other from a tank of pure water — are connected by a
      horizontal tube. The barometric pressure of the tall water columns
      creates a vacuum in the headspace.<br>
      <br>
      At normal temperatures, Khandan said, evaporation from the
      pure-water side will travel to the saline side and condense as the
      system seeks equilibrium. "That's nature," he said. "We want it to
      go the other way."<br>
      <br>
      Raising the temperature of the water in the headspace over the
      saline column slightly more than that of the freshwater column
      causes the flow to go in the other direction, so that pure,
      distilled water collects on one side and the brine concentrate is
      left behind in a separate container. A temperature increase of
      only 10 to 15 degrees is needed, Khandan said.<br>
      <br>
      "That's the trick of this vacuum," he said. "We don't have to boil
      the water like normal distillation, so you can use low-grade heat
      like solar energy or waste heat from a diesel engine or some other
      source of waste heat."<br>
      <br>
      Potentially a desalination system using this method could be
      coupled to a home's refrigerated air conditioning system, Khandan
      said.<br>
      <br>
      "When you air condition a house, you are pumping the heat outside
      the house, and the heat is wasted into the atmosphere," he said.
      "We want to capture that heat and use it to power this
      desalination system."<br>
      <br>
      The 30-foot-tall NMSU prototype is powered by a solar panel.
      Khandan and his research assistant, civil engineering doctoral
      student Veera Gnaneswar Gude, have modified the process originally
      developed by Florida researchers to incorporate a thermal energy
      storage device that allows the system to operate around-the-clock,
      using stored energy at night. The Institute of Energy and
      Environment housed in the NMSU College of Engineering helped them
      instrument the system.<br>
      <br>
      Their research on the system's capabilities has been presented at
      national and international conferences and their research
      continues.<br>
      <br>
      As with any desalination process, the system leaves behind a brine
      concentrate that must be disposed of, and some potential users may
      be put off by the unit's height, "but this technology could go to
      commercial scale pretty quickly," Khandan said. "The overall cost
      of desalination by this process can be very competitive."<br>
      <br>
      The project is one of many research initiatives at NMSU aimed at
      addressing the critical needs of New Mexico and the nation.<br>

      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>1. Field of the Invention (Technical Field)</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The present invention relates to an apparatus and method for
      desalination.<br>
      <br>
      <b>2. Description of Related Art</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Interest in the use of low grade heat sources and recovery of
      waste heat is growing due to increasing energy costs and declining
      energy sources. Examples of low grade energy sources include solar
      energy and heat rejected by fossil fuel-based power plants, air
      conditioning/refrigeration systems, and industrial processes. As a
      consequence of the laws of thermodynamics, thermal systems have to
      reject large quantities of low grade heat energy to the
      environment. For example, heat rejection rate of modern combined
      cycle power plants is almost equal to their output. Approaches to
      utilize waste heat to produce value added products or services can
      conserve limited energy sources, reduce adverse environmental
      impacts, and minimize overall costs.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention utilizes low grade heat to operate a new
      desalination process. Traditional desalination processes such as
      reverse osmosis, electrodialysis, mechanical vapor compression,
      and multi-effect flash distillation require electrical energy
      derived from nonrenewable sources, the cost of which has increased
      by 10 times over the past 20 years. Recently, a new desalination
      process has been proposed that has the potential to run solely on
      low grade heat sources at around 50° C. The present invention is a
      modification to that process, whereby it can run around the clock,
      using a thermal energy storage (TES) system that enables waste
      heat sources and renewable energy sources to be used to drive the
      process with minimum reliance on grid power. TES manages variable
      energy demand over time, is a continuous heat source, and has a
      lower specific energy for desalination. The present invention,
      unlike the process mentioned above, enables solar collectors and
      photovoltaic panels to provide the energy to drive the process.
      The TES system can be maintained at the desired temperature using
      low grade waste heat from any available source.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      A preferred embodiment of the present invention is described
      below. The embodiment is a desalination system comprising a
      desalination unit, a low grade heat source for powering the
      desalination unit and a thermal energy storage system for storing
      the low grade heat source and maintaining a specified temperature
      range. The system is able to run continuously within a specified
      temperature range between approximately 40-50° C. The low-grade
      heat source is at least partially supplied by an absorption
      refrigeration unit which maintains the thermal energy storage
      refrigeration unit at a specified temperature range. The
      absorption refrigeration unit operates at a pressure range of
      between approximately 1.4 to 15.75 kPa.<br>
      <br>
      The desalination unit comprises an evaporation chamber, a
      condenser, a heat exchanger and one or more columns. The columns
      comprise a saline water column, a brine withdrawal column and a
      desalinated water column. The heat input to the evaporation
      chamber is provided by the thermal energy storage system.<br>
      <br>
      The desalination system does not have a pump except for an initial
      starting pump. In addition, the system does not have any other
      moving parts.<br>
      <br>
      Another embodiment of the present invention is a method of
      desalinating comprising the steps of operating a desalination
      unit, powering the desalination unit using a low grade heat
      source, storing the low grade heat source in a thermal energy
      storage unit and maintaining a specified temperature range of the
      low grade heat source. The desalination unit can run continuously
      and comprises desalinating saline water at a temperature range of
      approximately 40-50° C. The method can also comprise supplying the
      low grade heat source at least partially by an absorption
      refrigeration unit. The absorption refrigeration unit can also
      provide a cooling load. The thermal energy storage unit is
      maintained at a specified temperature range within the absorption
      refrigeration unit. Finally, the absorption refrigeration unit
      operates at a pressure range of between approximately 1.4 to 15.75
      kPa.<br>

      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      This invention concerns the feasibility of a new desalination
      process utilizing low grade thermal energy. The process operates
      at near-vacuum pressures created by passive means. This allows for
      the process to operate at low temperatures with higher efficiency.
      The process utilizes low grade thermal energy rejected by an
      absorption refrigeration system (ARS). The condenser of the ARS
      rejects low grade thermal energy at approximately 55° C. which is
      recovered and stored in a low temperature thermal energy storage
      (TES) tank. A thermal energy storage tank serves best to manage
      energy demands of the desalination process by maintaining the
      source temperature at approximately 50-70° C. as the energy demand
      to the desalination system is dependent on the ambient
      temperature.<br>
      <br>
      Results of this feasibility study show that the thermal energy
      rejected by an ARS of cooling capacity of approximately 3.25 kW
      (0.975 tons of refrigeration) along with an additional energy
      input of approximately 208 kJ/kg of desalinated water is adequate
      to produce desalinated water at an average rate of approximately
      4.5 kg/hr. Energy demand for this process is competitive with
      well-established Multi Stage Flash distillation processes. An
      integrated process model and performance curves of the proposed
      approach are presented below. The effect of process parameters,
      such as withdrawal rate, are also presented below.<br>
      <br>
      The preferred embodiment of the desalination system of the present
      invention is shown schematically in FIG. 1. The invention
      comprises desalination unit 10, absorption refrigeration system
      12, and thermal energy storage 14. Desalination unit 10 comprises
      evaporation chamber 16, condenser 18, one or more heat exchangers
      20, 22, and columns 24, 26 and 28 (e.g. between approximately
      10-11 m tall, equivalent to the local barometric head). These
      three columns are saline water column 24, brine withdrawal column
      26, and desalinated water column 28, each with its own
      constant-level holding tank, saline water tank 30, brine tank 32,
      and desalinated water tank 34, respectively. The heat input to
      evaporation chamber 16 is provided by thermal energy storage 14,
      which is maintained at a particular temperature or range (e.g.
      between approximately 50-70° C.) by absorption refrigeration
      system 12, preferably powered by solar energy.<br>
      <br>
      Holding tanks, saline water tank 30, brine tank 32, and
      desalinated water tank 34 are installed at ground level while,
      evaporation chamber 16 is installed atop three columns 24, 26, 28
      at a barometric height (e.g. between approximately 10-11 m,
      equivalent to the local barometric head) above the free surface in
      holding tanks 30, 32, 34 to create a natural vacuum in the
      headspaces of three columns 24, 26, 28. This configuration enables
      the desalination process to proceed preferably without any
      mechanical pumping. There are also preferably no other moving
      parts needed, except for the pump used to start the system. The
      temperature of the head space of the feed water column is
      maintained slightly higher, approximately 45-65° C. than that of
      the desalinated water column, approximately 15-35° C. Since the
      head spaces are at near-vacuum level pressures, a temperature
      differential (e.g. between approximately 10-25° C.) is adequate to
      evaporate water from the feed water side and condense in the
      desalinated water side. In this manner, saline water can be
      desalinated at between approximately 40-50° C., which is in
      contrast to the 60-100° C. range in traditional solar stills and
      other distillation processes. Brine is withdrawn continuously from
      evaporation chamber 16 flowing through tube-in-tube heat exchanger
      20 preheating the saline water feed entering evaporation chamber
      16.<br>
      <br>
      Absorption refrigeration system 12 operates with a refrigerant
      (e.g. LiBr—H2O) in a pressure range of preferably 1 to 16 kPa.
      Heat energy required by generator 38 of absorption refrigeration
      system 12 is preferably supplied by solar collector 36 (e.g. flat
      panel) during sunlight hours and by auxiliary electric or gas
      heater 40 during non-sunlight hours. Solar collector 36 maintains
      generator 38 at a specified temperature or range (e.g. between
      approximately 80-110° C.). Heat rejected by condenser 42 of
      absorption refrigeration system 12 maintains thermal energy
      storage 14 at a specified temperature or range (e.g. between
      approximately 50-70° C.) to serve as the low grade heat source for
      the desalination process. Evaporator 44 of absorption
      refrigeration system 12 feeds the cooling load. Thus, the
      preferred embodiment of the present invention performs two
      functions of continuous desalination and cooling with minimal
      amounts of external nonrenewable energy input.<br>

      The preferred embodiment was developed based on mass and energy
      balances. Thermodynamic analysis of the preferred embodiment was
      performed through computer simulations using Extend, manufactured

      An evaporator area of 5 m&lt;2 &gt;and a height of 0.25 m were
      considered. In all calculations, the reference temperature was

      <b>Absorption Refrigeration System</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Absorption refrigeration system 12 is preferably driven by solar
      energy during sunlight hours and by auxiliary electric or gas
      heater 40 during non-sunlight hours, although any type of power
      may be utilized. The efficiency of solar collectors is expressed
      in terms of solar fraction, which is the contribution of solar
      energy to the total load in terms of the fractional reduction in
      the amount of extra energy that must be supplied. A storage tank
      volume of approximately 0.125 m&lt;3&gt;/m&lt;2 &gt;was considered
      and the optimum area of solar collectors required was found from a
      solar fraction graph. The optimum number of collectors was the
      lowest number of collectors for which a 100% solar fraction was
      achieved at the hour maximum solar radiation. Additional energy
      for heating and pumping was required for condenser 42 of
      absorption refrigeration system 12 to dissipate heat at
      approximately 55° C. The pumping requirements were calculated
      using EES® software.<br>

      <b>Results:</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The model equations were solved using the fixed parameters listed
      in FIG. 2 and for a particular site. Previous studies have shown
      that the effect of water depth in evaporation chamber 16 did not
      have any significant effect on the evaporation rate. This is in
      contrast to the traditional solar stills, where the water volume
      provided energy storage that is required for continued evaporation
      during non-sunlight hours. Since the preferred embodiment does not
      depend on solar energy for continuous operation, the effect of
      water depth was not taken into account.<br>
      <br>
      First, results of an example case where the model equations were
      solved for the reference parameters listed in FIG. 2 are
      presented. In this example case, the withdrawal rate was fixed at
      approximately 2.5 kg/hr (˜50%). These results demonstrate the
      effectiveness of the preferred embodiment. Then, the total energy
      consumption of the preferred embodiment was analyzed and compared
      to that of a multi-stage flash distillation process. Finally, the
      effect of withdrawal rate on the design and performance of the
      preferred embodiment is presented.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Heat Balance for Evaporation Chamber</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The heat balance for evaporation chamber 16 is described by
      Equation 3. FIG. 3 shows the variations in heat provided by
      thermal energy storage 14, the heat consumed for evaporation, and
      the heat lost over a 24-hr period for a summer day, when the
      ambient temperature ranged from between approximately 25 to 37° C.
      The desalination efficiency defined by Equation 6 is also
      indicated in FIG. 3 by the bold line. As expected, the heat lost
      by evaporation chamber 16 was higher during non-sunlight hours
      than that during sunlight hours due to lower ambient temperatures
      during non-sunlight hours. Under the example conditions, the
      energy available for desalination was about 12,500 kJ/hr (=3.45
      kW) which was the waste heat rejected by condenser 42 in
      absorption refrigeration system 12. However, the net heat transfer
      was dependent on the temperature gradient between the transfer
      medium and the heat source. The actual mass of water that could be
      evaporated in evaporation chamber 16 and hence, the desalination
      efficiency, depended on the heat input from thermal energy storage
      14, the ambient temperature at which the condensation took place,
      and the brine withdrawal rate. Since the driving force for
      evaporation is the temperature differential, between evaporation
      chamber 16 and condenser 42, the heat input to evaporation chamber
      16 during the day is lower than that input during the night.
      During the night, both the ambient temperature and the freshwater
      temperature are low, favoring a higher desalination rate, thus
      resulting in higher heat input and vice versa.<br>
      <br>
      The temperature variations in the saline water in evaporation
      chamber 16 and the desalinated water with respect to ambient
      temperature over a 24-hr period are shown in FIG. 4. The
      temperature of saline water varied from between approximately 43.5
      to 46° C. and the ambient temperature ranged from between
      approximately 25 to 37° C. while the fresh water temperatures
      ranged from between approximately 35 to 40° C. FIG. 4 shows that
      thermal energy storage 14 was able to maintain the approximately
      10° C. temperature differential between the saline water side and
      the desalinated water side. It is noted that the ambient
      temperature is an important variable because condensation occurs
      at the ambient temperature, which indirectly determines the
      desalination rate in this process.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Operating Conditions of Absorption Refrigeration System</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Absorption refrigeration system 12 is designed for two functions:
      for maintaining thermal energy storage 14 at the desired
      temperature and for providing the cooling load. As such,
      absorption refrigeration system 12 operates under slightly
      different conditions compared to the traditional systems used for
      cooling alone. Operating conditions for a typical absorption
      refrigeration system used in cooling and the conditions for
      absorption refrigeration system 12 are compared in FIG. 5, for the
      same cooling load of approximately 3.25 kW. The notable difference
      is the pressure ranges between approximately 1 and 6.3 kPa versus
      about 1.4 to 15.75 kPa respectively.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Volume of Thermal Energy Storage</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Winter conditions were assumed to determine the volume of thermal
      energy storage 14 necessary to provide the heat energy to
      evaporation chamber 16. Solving Equation 8 by trial and error so
      that the temperatures at the beginning and the end of a 24-hr
      period would be within approximately ±0.01° C., the volume of
      thermal energy storage 14 was found to be approximately 10
      m&lt;3&gt;. The heat demand by evaporation chamber 16 on thermal
      energy storage 14 varied from between approximately 8,700 and
      14,200 kJ/hr over a 24-hour period shown in FIG. 2; yet, as shown
      in FIG. 6, thermal energy storage 14 volume of approximately 10
      m&lt;3 &gt;was found to be adequate to maintain its temperature at
      approximately 50° C. throughout the same period to provide the
      energy needs of evaporation chamber 16.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Energy Requirements</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      An embodiment of the invention may require additional
      non-renewable energy for the following: auxiliary heat energy for
      generator 38 (=approximately 192 kJ/kg of desalinated water) plus
      mechanical energy to circulate heat transfer medium between
      thermal energy storage 14 and evaporation chamber 16
      (=approximately 14 kJ/kg of desalinated water); to circulate the
      heat transfer medium between thermal energy storage 14 and
      condenser 18 (=approximately 2 kJ/kg of desalinated water); and to
      pump the refrigerant in absorption refrigeration system 12
      (=approximately 0.04 kJ/kg of desalinated water). Hence, the total
      additional energy required to maintain thermal energy storage 14
      at the desired conditions is approximately 208 kJ/kg of
      desalinated water produced. In comparison, multi-stage flash
      distillation process would require a heat energy of approximately
      294 kJ/kg of desalinated water plus a mechanical energy of
      approximately 44 kJ/kg of desalinated water, for a total of
      approximately 338 kJ/kg of desalinated water. Thus, the present
      invention requires about 60% of the energy required by the
      multi-stage flash distillation process. A comparison between the
      two processes is summarized in FIG. 7.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Solar Collector for Absorption Refrigeration System</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Solar collector 36, augmented by auxiliary electric heater 40, is
      sized to provide for thermal energy storage 14 and the cooling
      load. The temperature of storage tank 46 of solar collector 36 is
      set to a particular temperature or range (e.g. between
      approximately 110-115° C.) in order to maintain generator 38
      temperature at a particular temperature or range (e.g. between
      approximately 100-110° C.). The energy to be provided by auxiliary
      heater 40 is equal to the difference between the energy required
      by generator 38 and that can be collected from solar isolation.
      FIG. 8 illustrates this difference and the solar fraction, over a
      24-hr period. The optimal area of the collectors can be found from
      Equation 7. For the conditions described herein, solar collector
      area of approximately 25 m&lt;2 &gt;can satisfy a cooling load of
      approximately 3.25 kW, at an average desalination rate of
      approximately 4.3 kg/hr. The relationships between desalination
      rate, solar panel area, and cooling load are presented in FIG. 9.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Brine Withdrawal vs. System Performance</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Brine withdrawal rate is the primary control variable in this
      system, which has positive as well as negative impacts on the
      performance of the system. At low withdrawal rates, salts build up
      in evaporation chamber 16, and evaporation rates decrease as shown
      by Equation 4. High salt levels also reduce the enthalpy of saline
      water that can further reduce evaporation. For example, when
      salinity increases by approximately 1%, evaporation is also
      reduced by about the same percentage. Even though better salt
      removal can be achieved with higher withdrawal rates, large
      amounts of sensible heat are also removed from evaporation chamber
      16, resulting in decline of evaporation chamber 16 temperature.
      Simulation results presented in FIG. 10 show the decline in
      evaporation chamber 16 temperature and in desalination efficiency
      with increasing withdrawal rate. For example, the desalination
      efficiency dropped from between approximately 90.5% and 80% when
      the withdrawal rate increased from between approximately 2.5 kg/hr
      and 25 kg/hr. FIG. 11 shows the salt buildup with time and the
      resulting decline in desalination rate. Similar observations have
      been reported previously.<br>
      <br>
      Further simulations were conducted to evaluate the effect of
      withdrawal rate on desalination rate, cooling load, solar
      collector area, and auxiliary heat requirement. As shown in FIG.
      12, cooling load and solar panel area are not sensitive to
      withdrawal rate in the range of between approximately 50-200%. For
      a given desalination rate, even though the cooling load at a
      withdrawal rate of approximately 200% is higher than that at
      approximately 100%, the auxiliary heat addition is also higher. In
      addition, the solar collector area is also higher. As discussed
      before, the desalination efficiency also decreases. Based on these
      results, a withdrawal rate of approximately 100% is an acceptable
      rate to minimize salt buildup and maintain system performance.<br>
      <br>
      In summary, model simulations show that the preferred embodiment
      can achieve a desalination efficiency of at least approximately
      85% and higher (e.g. approximately 85-90%) at a brine withdrawal
      rate of approximately 70-100% with an energy consumption of less
      than approximately 250 kJ/kg (e.g. between approximately 150-300
      kJ/kg) of freshwater from seawater. The energy requirements for
      the preferred embodiment are less than that are required for a
      multi-stage flash distillation process. Based on the results from
      the example, an approximate 100% withdrawal rate could prevent
      scale formation that could reduce the evaporation rate. A typical
      unit with a thermal energy storage volume, the volume calculated
      by solving a heat balance using trial and error (e.g. between
      approximately 10-20 m&lt;3&gt;), can produce fresh water at
      between approximately 4.5 kg/hr and provide a cooling load of
      between approximately 3.25 kW with a solar panel area of between
      approximately 25 m&lt;2&gt;. The preferred embodiment minimizes
      non-renewable energy usage and may be improved further by
      incorporating a double or triple-effect configuration.<br>
      <br>
      Although the invention has been described in detail with
      particular reference to these preferred embodiments, other
      embodiments can achieve the same results. Variations and
      modifications of the present invention will be obvious to those
      skilled in the art and it is intended to cover in the appended
      claims all such modifications and equivalents. An example of a

      were 10 m, equivalent to the local barometric head. The
      temperature of the head space of the feed water column was
      maintained at approximately 40-50° C., while the desalinated water
      column was maintained at approximately 35-45° C. The pressure in
      the evaporation chamber remained at approximately 0.085 atm. The
      specific energy required by this prototype was approximately 3,370
      kJ/kg of desalinated. This system was run entirely on solar energy
      with direct solar heat during sunlight hours and with a 350-W DC
      heater powered by batteries that were charged by the photovoltaic
      panels during the day time. This example system was able to
      recover potable quality water meeting United States Environmental
      Protection Agency drinking water standards from the effluent of a
      municipal wastewater treatment plant.<br>
