      <p>This photo is of the device called Elios. It concentrates the
        maximum energy output in the cavity. This device is able to
        destroy every type of toxic pollution, including nuclear
        radiation. Food exposed to its action changes completely because
        every chemical added was dissolved by balancing it's own Rhythm
        (vibration) by a multiwave signal comprising a full octave of
        colors. Every type of matter receives a certain type of
        enchancement from it. For example, our body and all types of
        biological entities are healed, and growth is boosted by it.
        This signal is a stationary type phenomenon of rotating
        particles that come from the Sun and others stars, that shoot
        the Earth, store energy, and return to its source in a reflected
        state generating the opposite phenomenon of discharge.
        Everything born, and growing, changes in this column of
        light-like particles (because this energy travels side by side
        with the Light). This phenomenon, called Solar-Terrestrial
        Rhythm, is the power supply of the Planet, continuosly balancing
        and growing; everything is in this phenomenon. Every matter has
        its own Rhythm plus the Solar-Terrestrial Rhythm. This rhythm is
        unique and represent the state of tension of the specific
        matter. It grows and evolves from it. If you modify it with
        pollutions, radiations, and other type of destructive phenomena,
        you destroy the normal work of Nature.This device concentrates
        locally this phenomenon and improves the Health and Life Energy
        of the environment. </p>
      <p>This device is only a passive resonator tuned with its' shape
        to resonate on an harmonic of the well described cosmic event
        signal. It consists of a ring of wood painted having seven holes
        in a heptagon shape in its inside perimeter. This ring is
        sustained by three legs disposed in a triangle fashion.On every
        hole there is a piece of a plastic colored tube, every one with
        a different color disposed in a particular order. The sinusoidal
        conductor that you can see is made of aluminium wire, wound
        clockwise, that was inserted in all the hole in a serpent
        movement form, leaving one end facing upward and the other
        downward. The signal start from the sky in a clockwise motion;
        remember that. The two ends finish in the near holes, one
        pointing skyward and another pointing toward the earth. Thats
        all! The device is located on the open soil, not cement, because
        this material generates an out of phase of the earth signal
        destroying the good rhythm. The phenomenon occurs in the cavity
        especially, and around the perimeter of the ring. To increase
        the amplitude of the signal you can put glass bottles filled
        with water, one inside the cavity and six on the outside in a
        hexagon form.Wait some days and observe the environment:
        Everything changes! There is a life explosion! Every phenomenon
        that I have described, happens depending only by the time and
        amplitude of the signal. The device needs the Sun light to
        operate better. Take it away from every artificial EMF because
        this is only a passive resonator and a strong emf can distort
        its' signal. </p>

      <p>Do not try nuclear cleansing with Elios until it is highly
        charged. The device is a passive resonator and it needs to build
        charge before bringing isotopes near it. Always use water
        containers in these experiments. Do NOT contact the substance
        with the apparatus.You can destroy the ambient rhythm and cause
        very big trouble in the area... It has a powerful resonance on
        sourraunding land, Km long .... </p>
      <p>On wine: I have noticed that wine when you open the bottle has
        a very powerful alcohol content,but after some hours the alchool
        seems to disappear... </p>
      <p>There is a gap between the ends of the aluminium coil in
        Elios.One points upward, and another points downward. The ends
        of the coil are parallel and put in near two last holes on the
        wood ring. </p>

      <p>(November 1998) --- We visit the fantastic laboratory of Pier
        Luigi Ighina, 90 years, who collaborated with Guglielmo Marconi.
        In the gardenof his house in Imolo, Professor Ighina has
        installed a large propeller that is able to remove or attract
        clouds. When we first saw it, the sky was completely cloudy;
        after starting the propellor in motion, in 10 minutes the clouds
        have split in two above the propellor.&nbsp; In adjacent land he
        has buried quintals of pure aluminum powder that has the
        function to multiply by a million times the energy of the
        magnetic monopoles. </p>

        <p><b>MAGNETIC RHYTHM SOLAR EARTH ENERGY</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>This great secret was discovered by scientist Pier Luigi Ighina
        of the International Center of Magnetic Studies, Imola, Italy.
        ERIM is a small apparatus that concentrates and develops the
        Magnetic Rhythm Solar Earth Energy, regenerating cells and
        returning them to normal functioning, with all its attendant
        benefits. </p>
      <p><b>PROPERTIES:</b> </p>
      <p>ERIM's properties are determined by its characteristic shape.
        The three yellow spirals pointing upwards concentrate SOLAR
        ENERGY. The three blue spirals pointing downwards concentrate
        EARTH ENERGY (please note that we are referring to the Earth's
        'bioenergy'or 'prana'). When these two energies converge or,
        more correctly, when the direct solar positive energy converges
        with its negative reflection from the Earth, they produce a wave
        on the green spirals called the SUN-EARTH MAGNETIC RHYTHM.
        Within this rhythm or pulse, the rhythms of everything existing
        on Earth - both animate and inanimate - are enhanced. </p>
      <p>Therefore, within its operating radius, ERIM normalizes or
        balances cells and cleanses the energy of a room. </p>
      <p><b>LOCATION-POSITION:</b> </p>
      <p>Ideally, ERIM should be placed in the bedroom so that it can
        act overnight, but it can also be effective almost anywhere
        (although it should be kept about 10-20 cm away from walls). At
        the beginning, to accelerate the process of cellular balancing,
        place your hands about 10-15 cm from each side of ERIM with your
        palms turned towards and at the same level as the green spirals.
        The time required will depend upon individual sensitivity </p>
      <p><b>OTHER USES OF ERIM:</b> </p>
      <p>If you have hot water central heating, you can place ERIM about
        10 cm from the boiler with the green spirals parallel to it; the
        circulating water will carry information throughout the system
        and cleanse rooms within a few days. To energize water and
        return it to its original, natural state place a bottle of water
        at each side of ERIM, about 10-15 cm from the green spirals.
        ERIM can also energize foodstuffs such as fruits, vegetables and
        meats by placing them level with, and about 10-15 cm in front of
        the green spirals,(using a non-metallic support, if necessary).
        Flowers placed close to ERIM will keep fresher longer, or will
        blossom sooner than normal. If you have hot water central
        heating, you can place ERIM about 10 cm from the boiler with the
        green spirals parallel to it; the circulating water will carry
        information throughout the system and cleanse rooms within a few
        days. To energize water and return it to its original, natural
        state place a bottle of water at each side of ERIM, about 10-15
        cm from the green spirals. ERIM can also energize foodstuffs
        such as fruits, vegetables and meats by placing them level with,
        and about 10-15 cm in front of the green spirals,(using a
        non-metallic support, if necessary). Flowers placed close to
        ERIM will keep fresher longer, or will blossom sooner than
        normal. </p>

        <p><b>Excerpts from: <i>The Magnetic Atom </i>by Pier L.
            Ighina</b></p>
      </center>
      <p><i>Note of the translator</i>: What follows is the resumed and
        translated text of the original Italian book “L’atomo magnetico”
        (1954) by Pier Luigi Ighina. This book is the only one written
        by the scientist. </p>
      <p>Pier Luigi Ighina has been a co-operator of Guglielmo Marconi
        and shared his most secret experiments. During his whole life he
        has worked without being recognized by the scientific community
        and achieving incredible results which are even today not
        imaginable for most scientists.He is now 93 years old and goes
        on with his researches. <br>
        With this translation I want to introduce this incredible
        scientist to the English speaking world and I hope that this
        will cause a growing interest in his work which could be of
        great help in today’s social and environmental situation. </p>
      <p>Regarding the translation, I excuse myself in advance for every
        mistake I might have done translating his work, but I believe
        that the main facts are correct. <br>
        In order not to change the original meaning, I have translated
        the Italian words “materia” and “atomo” into “Matter” and “Atom”
        using them the way he did, which means that “Materia”, for
        example, is used for both living and non-living substances and
        “Atomo” is used in a wider meaning than what we are used to.
        Concerning the use of the word “Magnetic”, my personal opinion
        is that also this word is to be understood in a much larger
        conception of Magnetism than what we are usually accustomed to.
      </p>
      <p>I hope you enjoy the reading and feel the big impact these
        discoveries could have in today’s scientific understanding of
        the World, Man and Life. </p>

      <b>The Discovery of the Magnetic Atom (First Part: Theory)</b>
      <p>When the scientists first started studying the atom, they soon
        realized that when it was excited by the light atom, it would
        just disappear in the light. So they started to excite it with
        strong magnetic fields and strong electric tensions, causing the
        alteration of the atom itself. In fact, in Dr. Ighinas opinion,
        electrons, protons, neutrons, positrons etc. are products of an
        altered atom, so their laws are altered in respect to the normal
        atom. </p>
      <p>He thinks: how can you attempt to study something that is in
        constant motion by accelerating its motion? He developed the
        idea of trying to stop the motion of the atom. <br>
        When observing an atom under an atomic microscope, he defined 4
        fundamental laws: </p>
      <p>1) The light atoms, when they excite the observed atoms, give
        part of their motion to the latter. </p>
      <p>2) The observed atoms absorb part of the motion of the light
        atoms to speed up theirs. </p>
      <p>3) In order to excite an atom, you need it to get in touch with
        an atom of higher motion; the atom with the highest motion will
        attract the one with the lowest motion. </p>
      <p>4) The higher the atoms motion, the more luminous it will be
        and vice-versa. </p>
      <p>By examining the atoms of different matter, he found out that
        every atom has its own absorbing rate. From this discovery he
        made a scale of atoms of different matter with absorbing rates,
        in relation to the light atom, from 95% to 1%. It took him 4
        years of study to create this scale. </p>
      <p>The other problem he had in observing the atoms was that they
        are also disturbed by the surrounding atoms. In order to isolate
        the observed atom he created some sort of a “wall” composed by
        different layers of atoms, setting the ones with the maximum
        absorption (95%) in the inside close to the observed atoms and
        then one after the other the different matter with diminishing
        absorption rates (85%, then 75%, and so on until the 1%). With
        this idea he was able to create some sort of canals that would
        take the motion away from the observed atoms and make them be
        almost still. But there still was the problem of having a
        stronger microscope. He invented a microscope (see later) with
        which he was finally able to observe the atoms at a enlargement
        of 1.6 billion times. </p>
      <p>Through his observation he noticed that the atoms had a
        pulsation and, with every pulsation, a luminous circle would
        leave the centre of the atom and get bigger moving away from it.
        The different circles would create some kind of shield around
        the atom. He concluded that the atoms don’t oscillate but
        vibrate, and that it is possible to divide its energy but not
        the atom itself. He also noticed that after a while, the atom
        excited to its maximum by the light atoms would explode, and
        after that there were two atoms. He called this phenomenon the
        reproduction of matter. He observed that different matter have
        different pulsations. These atoms, which he called “reproductive
        permanents”, are present in all organic matter, while in the
        minerals the atoms don’t have any reproduction unless they are
        excited from atoms with more power. </p>
      <p>The various colours and shapes of matter are due to alterations
        in the vibration of the atoms that compose it. For example, if a
        flower has a basic atomic pulsation of 1000, and its external
        atoms get in touch with other atoms like those of light, heat,
        gas, etc. the latter change the former’s vibration to 1000.01,
        1000.02 which correspond to the colours and shape of the matter.
        Upon this discovery he made a scale of alterations which showed
        him that when he would reach a pulsation of 1001, the matter
        would transform. He classified different categories of atoms:
        reproductive atoms, motionless atoms, non reproductive atoms,
        semi reproductive atoms, permanent reproductive atoms, and so
        on. While being busy experimenting, he noticed that if he moved
        a magnet close to the observed atoms they would all move quickly
        disappearing then in a luminous mass. He tried then to observe
        the atoms of magnetite (until now he had been able to do all
        observations with a resolution of under 1 billion times). This
        time he needed to go over 1 billion enlargements to see these
        atoms, and as he saw them they were moving a lot faster than the
        usual atoms and were a lot smaller. He tried to stop their
        motion with his developed technique, but without success. These
        atoms appeared to have a reproductive permanent motion which was
        much faster than the others. Enlarging the atoms to 1.2 billion
        times he saw that they were present in all matter, and
        especially in the air. He decided to call them magnetic atoms.
        After long experimentation he was finally able to almost totally
        isolate them. At this point he made another astounding
        observation: while isolating the usual atoms would stop their
        motion, isolating the magnetic atoms would accelerate their
        motion to the point of developing such strong atomic energy that
        the surrounding atoms would be influenced. Since this reaction
        was dangerous, he developed a particular substance composed by
        different atoms and was finally able to isolate the magnetic
        atoms. By studying it he found out that it was identical to the
        reproductive atoms with the only difference that its motion was
        perpetual. Putting this atom in contact with other different
        atoms he could observe the following: when the magnetic atom is
        isolated it develops its maximum motion until it meets another
        atom of its same motion sensitivity (pulsation); this atom
        starts to move and absorb pulsations from the magnetic atom
        until it has reached its maximum motion; at this point the two
        atoms go apart. In the meantime the atom has diminished the
        motion of the magnetic atom, so the latter will find another
        atom with that new motion sensitivity and transmit motion to
        this one until it has reached its maximum motion, then detach
        and so on until the magnetic atom has reached its minimum
        pulsation. But, since its pulsation is everlasting, it will
        raise again and the whole process recommences. This way he
        discovered that the magnetic atom is the one that gives motion
        to all the others. He was successful in isolating these atoms
        from the magnetic demonstrating that they would not move anymore
        without the contact with the magnetic atom. He could also
        demonstrate that it was responsible for all the variations of
        the atoms of all matter. </p>
      <p>From this experimentations he developed an apparatus that
        enabled him to regulate the magnetic atomic vibrations. He was
        thus able to control the energy of the matter. He tried to tune
        in into the different matter to see if he could know their exact
        vibration. He was successful in that and so, leaving the
        apparatus for a whole day tuned in into the vibration of a
        certain matter, the next day the apparatus had slightly changed
        its vibratory rate, and so had done the matter itself. This
        matter seemed now to have a different structure, more similar to
        that corresponding to the new vibration. Through various
        experiments he realized that this way he could change a matter
        into another. </p>
      <p>With his apparatus he identified the exact vibration of the
        atoms of an apple tree and of a peach tree. He tuned the
        apparatus into the peach tree vibration and started to raise it
        within a time of 8 hours to the vibration of the apple tree. He
        then left the peach tree with the vibration of the apple tree
        for a period of 16 days. After this time the peach tree had
        become an apple tree. With this technique he also transformed
        the tail of a rat into the tail of a cat. The transformation
        needed 4 days to take place, and after that time the tail
        started to become a rat tail once more, but then it fell and the
        mouse died. The atoms of the tail hadn’t stood the alteration.
        In another experiment he tried to heal an injured rabbit. He
        analysed the vibration of the injured bone in comparison to the
        one of a sane bone. The health vibration was interrupted exactly
        where the rabbit was injured. So he tuned his machine into the
        sane bone vibratory rate and applied it close to the injured
        area. The atoms started to reproduce and the two sane parts of
        the bone started to grow together until there was continuity in
        the vibrations of the injured area. This way the altered matter
        became normal again and the fever disappeared. </p>
      <p>He explains fever this way: due to the interruption of
        vibration of ill matter, the surrounding healthy atoms raise
        their vibration because of the loss of absorption of the ill
        matter. As soon as the normal continuity of vibration is
        reinstalled, the fever stops. </p>
      <p>He then tried to melt metals at a distance, and during these
        experiments he discovered that the faster an atom, the more it
        attracts another atom. With his apparatus he produced atomic
        vibrations of fast atoms which on their way attracted magnetic
        atoms from the ether, forming some sort of a canal. The stronger
        the vibration, the longer the canal. But the canal was disturbed
        by the other non-magnetic atoms, so he resolved the problem
        creating five canals in the same direction forming some sort of
        a tube which was empty inside.Inside the tube he created another
        canal which was tuned with the atoms of the matter he wanted to
        excite.With this method he was able to tune into the vibration
        of the atomic bomb “Bikini” in order to neutralize it, but a
        non-planned return of the vibrations perforated the apparatus
        and he had to stop the experiment of neutralization of the bomb.
        Anyway, he says that due to the absorption of vibration in the
        canal the explosion was less strong. </p>
      <p>In 1946 he successfully melted some metal at a distance in
        presence of a journalist. He also transmitted electric energy
        through light atoms. He once succeeded in absorbing electric
        energy by pointing his machine towards high tension lines. From
        these experiments he could understand that electricity is the
        excitation of the metal atoms caused by the magnetic atoms. In
        fact, he succeeded in turning an usually non-conductive
        substance into a conductive one just by exciting its atoms. The
        atomic explosions cause the magnetic atoms to gather in great
        amounts. These magnetic atoms create great excitation on the
        surrounding atoms causing their reproduction to their maximum
        vibration. The different gatherings have different atomic
        vibration and create, when they meet, huge electrical
        discharges. If the humans go on with their experiments on atomic
        energy, it will create many gatherings of magnetic atoms and the
        following discharges will cause perturbations all over the
        hemisphere. This will also cause alteration in the tissues of
        the living beings. </p>
      <p>Still in 1946, he started some experiments to analyse the
        underground. He tuned the canal of his apparatus into the
        vibration of the materials he was looking for successfully
        discovering underground oilfields and coal seams at depths of
        over 10,000 meters. Through this research he discovered the
        links between methane, petrol and coal. After that he was able
        to create different Hydrocarbons from simple methane. </p>
      <p>He made various analysis and experiments on grounds and found
        out that chemical fertilizers wouldn’t work as well as cow dung.
        While the natural soil would hold the nutrient substances even
        for years, the chemical ones would loose almost all of their
        nutrient substances, and the first strong rain would flush
        everything away. After a deep analysis with his machine of the
        existing compounds in the natural dung (he found many which
        couldn’t even be found by a chemical analysis) he created a new
        fertilizer containing the exact percentages of those substances
        as in the natural dung; he didn’t have the problem of the rain
        flushing as before and the plants would grow for years without
        adding any new dung. The plants even seemed to be more resistant
        to insects and diseases. </p>
      <p>He then made researches on the germination of corn: tuning the
        vibration of his apparatus into that of the corn he discovered
        its process of enlargement. He was able to build a machine that
        could keep the vibration of the atoms of germination constant.
        His final results were: ten times heavier grains than the usual,
        with a content of gluten six times the usual and a stem three
        times thicker. </p>
      <p>Once, while he was analysing the clouds with his machine, a
        flying saucer passed between the vibrating canals of atomic
        magnetic energy. His machine showed him the shape, the
        composition and functioning principle of the engine. He
        calculated that the speed was of 5000 Km/h. After his ultimate
        studies of the magnetic atom he was able to group them into two
        categories: if the atom starts its pulsation by contracting, it
        has got negative properties, if its pulsation starts by
        expanding, then it has got positive properties. He theorized
        that if it were possible to separate the two kinds of atoms and
        put them together separated by absorbing atoms, one could have a
        continuous and eternal production of electric energy. </p>
      <p>He ends the first part of the book by asking himself what the
        power is which eternally moves the magnetic atom. </p>
      <p><b>The Magnetic Atom (Second Part: Technics)</b> </p>
      <p>In 1954 he was visited by some greatly renown Italian
        scientists who mainly said that it is not possible that a single
        working man with his own resources could achieve important
        scientific results without expensive machinery. One of these
        scientists even said that the magnetic atom had already been
        discovered by science. The affirmations of this scientist were
        even published on a local newspaper, and after that Dr. Ighina
        received many letters from high positioned scientists who, part
        of them at least, were deeply interested in Ighinas theories. </p>
      <p>He answered that since 1926 he had been studying the effect of
        the planetary magnetic field on human vitality and in the
        formation of matter. In 1928 he sent part of his research to the
        Istituto Nazionale Scienze ed Invenzioni of Rome (National
        Institution of Sciences and Inventions). The answer he got was
        that his studies were too far away from the fundamental laws of
        physics and therefore were considered unacceptable. </p>
      <p>He says that the scientific community has used the magnetic
        field since the beginning of the research in nuclear physics. He
        is convinced that the magnetic field of the earth is responsible
        for many nuclear reactions on the planet. He has experimentally
        proved that the formation of electricity in the clouds is due to
        the planetary magnetic field: the condensation of the water
        vapours is driven all around the globe by rotation and when a
        layer of moisture passes over the poles its atoms are positively
        excited (electrification). If there is another lower layer of
        clouds that runs in the opposite direction (which gets
        negatively excited) the two layers will attract each other
        creating nuclear reactions. This reaction transforms the gases
        into water and this is, in Dr. Ighinas opinion, the proof that
        the magnetic field is the cause of all nuclear reactions. He is
        convinced that without the magnetic field no reaction at all
        could take place, and thus no life could exist. </p>
      <p><b>The Lenticular Microscope</b> </p>
      <p>In the years between 1928 and 1932 he tried to develop a strong
        microscope (indispensable in the study of the matter). After
        years of research he noticed that if he rotated some lenses and
        oculars at a certain speed he was able to eliminate the
        refraction of the lenses of the microscope and, marking the
        edges of the lenses with some longitudinal and vertical lines,
        he could still get the image of the observed object. In order to
        obtain a clear image, he had to find the relationship among the
        focus of the lenses and the speed of the rotating lenses. He
        invented this procedure because, since he wanted to have a
        bigger enlargement, he thought he could put different
        microscopes in series one after the other. For doing this he
        needed to do the following: first eliminate the refraction of
        the lenses, second project the image right into the eye of the
        observer. Once he managed to project the image on the ocular of
        the microscope, he could add another in series. After months of
        experimentation in the correct regulation of the focus of the
        microscopes and of the speed of the rotating lenses, he was
        successful in obtaining an image. His thinking led him to the
        following calculation: if he added a second microscope to the
        first (supposing they all have an enlargement of 200 times) the
        enlargement would be 200 x 200 = 40,000 times. A third
        microscope added would enlarge 40,000 x 200 = 8,000,000 times.
        With the forth he could reach an enlargement of 1,600,000,000
        times. And that is what he did. But there was still a problem:
        all those lenses absorbed almost all of the light so no vision
        was possible. He solved this problem by passing the illuminating
        light through a similar microscope as he had constructed but
        without marks on the rotating lenses. With cautious regulation
        of the focus and rotating speed of the lenses of the two
        microscopes he obtained that the illuminating atoms were equal
        to those transmitted by the observing microscope, thus creating
        a good contrast between black and white. It took him 4 years of
        work to build this special microscope. </p>
      <p><b>The discovery of the Magnetic Atom</b> </p>
      <p>He tried to observe some magnetite crystals over a long period
        of time without obtaining results. He was particularly
        interested in the magnetic flux, so he tried to observe a piece
        of crystalline glass which was interposed between a magnet and a
        piece of iron. If there was a flux something would deposit on
        the glass surface. No results. </p>
      <p>One day, while he was observing the glass, he inadvertently hit
        a magnet which fell on the ground passing close to the glass. He
        saw a lot of movement and lightning. After long observations of
        this phenomenon he could detect a very small atom. He noticed
        that the irradiations of radioactive metals was due to these
        small atoms which reacted with the radioactive metal atoms
        taking them to their maximum motion and creating an amorphous
        state of matter around; this amorphous matter would not allow
        the growing motion to disperse by hitting atoms in the
        surrounding area. These small atoms he called magnetic atoms and
        (as previously said) were responsible for the motion of all the
        other atoms in nature. But the most important property of these
        atoms was not only that they could unite themselves with each
        other, but that they could raise their motion and the one of the
        adjacent atoms with the cooperation of other magnetic atoms. In
        the meantime he observed that all existing matter had the
        property of having a particular atomic motion (vibration) that
        determined the substance and the shape of that particular
        matter. He thought then that if he could build an apparatus that
        would be able to shift the atomic motion of the matter, he could
        change the structure of that matter. He realized that this was
        exactly what Mother Nature is doing in the changes of the
        vegetative substances existing on earth. </p>
      <p><b>Apparatus for Producing the Atomic Magnetic Vibrations</b> </p>
      <p>How could he obtain the union of these magnetic atoms? He tried
        to isolate them, but this was a dangerous procedure because,
        once isolated, these atoms would start to vibrate stronger and
        stronger until they would split creating new atoms which were so
        powerful that they couldn’t be stored because all the adjacent
        substances would melt. After years of experimentation he was
        then able to obtain magnetic atoms whose vibration he could
        control thanks to the construction of micro-electromagnets; this
        allowed him to obtain the various vibrations existing in the
        different matters. </p>
      <p>He built the vibrator of magnetic atoms. He had previously
        noticed that all matter have a magnetic field composed of
        magnetic atoms and of atoms of that matter. These magnetic atoms
        created two poles that surrounded the whole. He thus built an
        electromagnetic field identical to the one made by nature in a
        way that the positive pole would always be over the ground and
        the negative pole would be close to the ground. The apparatus
        appeared like some kind of semioval ball, but this ball had to
        rotate. He thus had to create an identical field to that of the
        matter to explore, and then put that matter inside the
        apparatus. After experimentation he was able to couple the
        natural magnetic field of the matter with his created
        electromagnetic field. He now only needed to equal the vibration
        of the electromagnetic field with that of the matter. This way
        he could then change the vibration of the matter as he liked. </p>
      <p><b>Constitution of the Apparatus</b> </p>
      <p>The apparatus is constituted as follows: a rotating
        electromagnetic field identical in shape and polarity to that of
        the explored matter. The explored matter is put in this
        electromagnetic field. The DC current needed for the coils to
        create the field is passed through some very powerful
        potentiometers. Rotating the electromagnetic field and moving
        the potentiometer, at a certain point you obtain the same
        magnetic vibrations of the field of the explored matter. This
        fact is clear when looking at the ammeter and the magnetometer
        which show a little absorption caused by the magnetic atoms
        which unite, due to the same vibration, to the atoms of the
        matter. At this point it is easy to change the matter: it
        suffices to regulate the two potentiometers a little bit up or
        down to change the vibrations of the magnetic atoms and thus of
        the matter atoms. But not all atoms are subjected to the
        variation: many don’t stand it because they go apart creating a
        new variation which is the result of the two vibrations (the
        original and the excited one). </p>
      <p>Why do we need to rotate the magnetic field? </p>
      <p>By rotating the magnetic field all the magnetic atoms get
        together and create many little canals between the field and the
        matter which are responsible for changing the matter atoms when
        the coils change the electromagnetic field. All this happens at
        a determined rotation which has to be discovered together with
        the variations of the potentiometer. </p>
      <p>As previously said, with this machine and his theories he was
        able to change a peach tree into an apple tree. </p>
      <p>From other experiment on animals, he could see that the
        lethargy of the animals is caused by a self regulation of their
        magnetic field in order to slow down the vibration of the matter
        but keeping the magnetic atoms vibrating. This way the matter
        atoms always keep a little motion which can last for long
        periods without the necessity of the chemical reactions produced
        by alimentation. The animals can even protect themselves from
        different dangers (atmospheric agents, chemical agents, and even
        ground radiations). </p>
      <p>He could do the same experiments that hypnotisers do, who just
        tune into the persons magnetic field changing it as they like.
        Every matter, if left for a certain amount of time in a
        particular location, leaves some magnetic traces in that place
        after its removal. As previously said, after experimenting on
        animals he concluded that the magnetic field protects us and
        when variation occurs, we become sick. </p>
      <p>Birds recognize their place of birth from its magnetic field.
        Once he made the experiment of scaring all the swallows that
        lived around his house, creating then an electromagnetic field
        around it. The swallows weren’t able to go back to their nests
        anymore. After removal of the magnetic field they went back with
        no problems. </p>
      <p>In another experiment he created an electromagnetic field
        similar to the one of humans around a balloon full of insects
        which was sent in the air with an altimeter and his address.
        After two days somebody took the balloon back to him. It had
        gone up to the height of 97,000[?] meters, but the insects were
        still alive. After this experiment another one followed in which
        he created a strong electromagnetic field around a plant. By
        trying to project heat, cold, humidity, Alpha and Beta rays
        against the field, none of them passed through. Only by
        variation of the field itself he was able to project some of
        these conditions through it. The obvious consequence was that
        introducing inside the field any condition he wanted, he could
        keep it that way with no dispersion. </p>
      <p>By putting different objects inside a strong electromagnetic
        field and tuning his apparatus with them, after having left it
        on for a few hours he measured that every object had its own
        field but it was complete and identical to the resulting
        magnetic field but in smaller proportions. This is, in Dr.
        Ighinas opinion, the proof of the function and influence of the
        planetary magnetic field on all existing matter and living
        beings. The radar, is dangerous for life because it’s composed
        of a rotating magnetic field and can create a series of magnetic
        atoms. It can thus excite the magnetic atoms of all matter,
        especially those of humans because they are more sensible.
        Through the construction of a special valve which created
        luminous rays conducing electricity, in 1943 he was able to
        create a direct TV image which was not decomposed and then
        recomposed into lines (as is usually done by normal TVs). </p>
      <p>One day, while analysing the radioactivity of certain
        substances with a Muller counter, he noticed that he had a quite
        strong magnetic radioactive reaction on motorcycles that had run
        on the Imola racing circuit. After some research on this odd
        fact, he found out that all vehicles have a magnetic vibrations
        due to various engine elements. These vibrations discharge on
        the ground and penetrate into the depths for a few dozen meters
        creating many microscopic holes. After several rounds these
        emitted vibrations unite with those of the underground gases
        deposits. What happens is that in a specific part of the circuit
        the driver passes into a cloud of atoms of those gases which,
        attracted by the magnetic vibration of the engine, will invest
        the driver and in contact with all these vibration a nuclear
        reaction will take place around the drivers magnetic body
        causing unbalance. He related this fact to the well-known
        reality of the so called “death roads” where people keep on
        having car accidents without any apparent reason. </p>
      <p>While he was studying the difference of the chemical
        fertilizers and the natural dung, he found out that the natural
        ones contained some kind of vegetal oil which was absent in the
        chemical. With the microscope he thus studied a natural
        environment in putrefaction, and saw that there were little
        micro organisms that would absorb substances from the rotting
        compounds. After a while, these micro organisms would transform
        into little solid formations of oil. This oil is not flushed
        away like it happens with the chemical fertilizers. The roots of
        the plants, containing little amounts of acid substances,
        release these substances which dissolve the oil making it
        absorbable to the plant roots. These little drops of oil then go
        into the lymphatic system of the plant cleaning it from toxic
        substances. The plant then expels these toxic oil particles by
        normal transpiration. </p>
      <p>While doing experiments with the magnetic vibrator, he saw a
        flying saucer pass over his laboratory and land on a hill. He
        immediately went there and saw three people exiting the saucer.
        He asked them why they had landed, and they said they had
        magnetic disturbances. He said he was the cause of that, and
        after having agreed not to talk to anybody about the meeting for
        at least 7 years, he had the possibility of entering the saucer
        and study its propulsion, then took two of them to his
        laboratory and showed them his experiment. He describes the
        saucer as follows: two iron disks concave in the middle forming
        the shape of a shell. They were fixed on two pins that would
        allow them to rotate. At the edges of the disks there were
        different funnels: the upper ones were reversed in respect to
        the lower ones. Inside the saucer on both sides there were iron
        tubes wrapped with copper wires. These coils had the property of
        creating a magnetic field on the surface of the saucer. While
        functioning, the upper disk would rotate and the funnels would
        do the same work as the paddles in a boat. In a complicated mode
        this rotation of the funnels around the saucer would give the
        saucer motion and eliminate the resistance of the air. The two
        disks could have whatever magnetic polarity one would desire. By
        applying negative polarity on the surface of the saucer, this
        would create a repulsion with the negative polarity of the earth
        and thus an upward motion. The opposite would be done in case of
        landing. The saucer could also have positive polarity on the
        upper disk and negative on the lower, or vice-versa. With this
        technology the saucer could reach speeds of 5,000 km/h. The
        igniting motion of the disks was furnished by a nickel-chrome
        battery. The big problem of this model of saucer was that with
        the high speed the funnels would melt due to the friction with
        the air. </p>
      <p>In relation with the planetary magnetic field, he says that if
        you put two planets too close to one another, the interference
        between the two rotating magnetic fields will cause a variation
        of them. These variations would cause on each planet
        disequilibria among the different substances with a final result
        of explosion of the two and creation of many small planets. This
        is the result of a laboratory experiment. </p>
      <p><b>The Telescope</b> </p>
      <p>Based on the technology of the microscope, he built a telescope
        and could see water, mountains, vegetation, fauna and beings
        similar to humans on the moons surface. (Note of the translator:
        in a personal discussion with an assistant of Dr. Ighina, I was
        told that he believes that the day-night rhythm is not depending
        on the earths rotation, but on the rotation of the magnetic
        field; furthermore he states that no human being has ever gone
        on the moon yet because the conditions there would not allow a
        normal human being to survive for a second, since there is not
        the correct combination of sun energy and planetary response
        energy which are the basic pillars of life). </p>
      <p>In order to go on other planets, we need to create the same
        magnetic field as we have on earth. </p>
      <p>While studying the stars, he could see that every one has its
        own magnetic field. By tuning his apparatus on that magnetic
        field he could hear harmonic sounds of music and sounds similar
        to the human voice. </p>
      <p>He hypothesizes that with the union of the positive and the
        negative magnetic atoms he could create an eternal source of
        energy just by utilizing the magnetic rotation of the earth. </p>

      <p>During the work was projected a video tape (recorded by a
        troupe of RAI 3 for <br>

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ighina with entering Monopòli
        Magnets. </p>
      <p>La traslazione di energia è avvenuta tramite l’attivazione
        della macchina produttrice di Monopòli Magnetici - ideata e
        costruita dallo stesso Ighina - composta da un generatore
        centrale e da un sistema ad elica posizionato all’esterno del
        suo laboratorio, in un terreno adiacente sotto il quale sono
        stati sepolti quintali di purissima polvere di alluminio che ha
        la funzione di moltiplicare milioni di volte l’energia di ogni
        singolo monopòlo. </p>
      <p>The transfer of power took place through the activation of the
        machine producing Monopòli <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Magnets - designed and built by
        the same Ighina - made up of a central generator and a <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dual-propeller positioned outside
        of his laboratory, in a land adjacent under which <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; were buried quintals of pure
        aluminium powder which has the function multiply million <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; times the energy of each
        monopòlo. </p>
      <p><i>Ighina ha chiamato "Monopòlo Positivo" l’unità neutrinica
          proveniente dal Sole e "Monopòlo Negativo" l’unità neutrinica
          prodotta dalla Terra. In pratica, lo scienziato è riuscito a
          riprodurre, tramite il suo congegno, le due forze fondamentali
          esistenti in Natura: l’energia positiva e l’energia negativa
          materializzate sul nostro pianeta dal "ritmo" Sole-Terra,
          ovvero dall’energia solare che scende, avvolge ed alimenta il
          pianeta e poi risale, dando origine ad un moto perpetuo che è
          la fonte stessa di tutta la materia creata.</i> </p>
      <p>Ighina called "Positive Monopòlo" unity neutrinica coming from
        the Sun and "Monopòlo <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Negative "unity neutrinica
        produced by the Earth. In practice, the scientist was able to
        reproduce, <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; through its device, the two
        fundamental forces existing in Nature: the positive energy and
        Energy <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; negative material on our planet
        by the "rhythm" Sun-Earth, or solar energy that <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; down, wraps and nourishes the
        planet and then goes back, giving rise to a perpetual motion
        that is the <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; very source of all the material
        created. </p>
      <p>Attraverso l’uso appropriato di queste energie
        meravigliosamente naturali, ecco verificarsi il "miracolo"
        scientifico e tangibilmente reale che produce la pioggia o la
        neutralizza! Una scoperta che potrà risolvere il dramma infinito
        delle siccità e delle alluvioni che imperversano in diverse zone
        del mondo. Un olocausto inutile che, forse già da 60 anni a
        questa parte, poteva essere evitato. </p>
      <p>Through the appropriate use of these energies wonderfully
        natural, here occur <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "miracle" scientific and tangible
        real that produces rain or neutralizes! A discovery <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; which can solve the infinite
        tragedy of drought and floods that raging in different <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; parts of the world. A holocaust
        that useless, perhaps already 60 years from now, could be <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; avoided. </p>
      <p>Proprio in presenza dei gravi problemi di siccità verificatisi
        ultimamente in Italia, dal Centro Internazionale di Studi
        Magnetici, di cui Pierluigi Ighina è fondatore, sono stati
        inviati centinaia di comunicati a laboratori ed enti preposti,
        operanti nel contesto ufficiale, offrendo la risoluzione
        immediata del problema. Tuttavia, non sono pervenuti risposte né
        cenni di interesse ogni volta che è stato offerto l’antidoto ai
        terremoti, ai tornadi ed al disgregamento cellulare dell’uomo e
        del pianeta causato dall’esplosione di ordigni atomici e dalle
        radiazioni nucleari tuttora esistenti nella nostra atmosfera. </p>
      <p>Precisely in the presence of serious problems of drought that
        occurred recently in Italy, by the Centre <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Magnets International Studies,
        which is Pierluigi Ighina founder, were sent hundreds of <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; communicated to laboratories and
        agencies, operating in the Journal, offering the resolution <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Instant problem. However, I am
        not received answers or hints of interest every time <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; who was offered the antidote to
        earthquakes, to tornadi and disgregamento phone and the <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; planet caused by the explosion of
        atomic bombs and nuclear radiation that still exist in <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; our atmosphere. </p>
      <p>Questa sorta di "congiura del silenzio" è stata denunciata
        anche dal Professor Giuliano Preparata (purtroppo scomparso
        proprio in questi giorni) fisico nucleare di altissimo livello,
        noto per aver condotto esperimenti d’avanguardia sulla Fusione
        Fredda, basandosi sugli studi di Martin Fleischmann e Stanley
        Pons. Fu proprio il Prof. Preparata a dichiarare che la
        genialità di Ighina risulta troppo scomoda per i "baroni" della
        scienza ufficiale che, abituati a dominare e manipolare il
        sistema, mai accetteranno l’intrusione di una mente talmente
        evoluta da stravolgere tutti i loro piani, far traballare i loro
        "troni" e minare le loro tanto radicate teorie. </p>
      <p>This sort of "conspiracy of silence" was also denounced by
        Professor Giuliano Preparata <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (unfortunately disappeared in
        these days) nuclear physicist at the highest level, known for
        having <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; conducted pioneering experiments
        on Cold Fusion, based on studies of Martin <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stanley Pons and Fleischmann. It
        was Prof.. Prepared to declare that the brilliant Ighina <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is too uncomfortable for the
        "barons" of science official, used to dominate and manipulate <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the system, never accept the
        intrusion of a mind evolved to be so upset all their <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; plans, to traballare their
        "thrones" and undermine their much rooted theories. <br>

      <p><i>Ciò che è stato tenuto nascosto da tempo immemore e ciò che
          all’uomo è stato negato come diritto di informazione e di
          scelta ora va svelato. L’opera di Ighina ci consentirà di
          strappare il velo dell’ignoranza e di conoscere l’armonia e
          l’intelligenza degli spazi celesti, dove la sapienza è
          l’alchimia pura degli elementi. L’unico interesse di chi
          possiede tale alchimia non è la Potenza, non è il controllo,
          né l’uso scellerato delle Forze, ma soltanto l’Amore. Ighina
          da sempre asserisce che non basta scoprire nuove fonti di
          energia, se non vi è conoscenza profonda degli equilibri delle
          Forze: "Tutto deve essere compiuto nel totale rispetto della
          Natura, rigorosamente controllato da una mente sapiente ed
          armoniosa dove scienza e coscienza sono le coordinate
          assolute". Quindi, dobbiamo eliminare la scissione esistente
          tra scienza e coscienza, perché la separazione di queste
          coordinate essenziali darebbe origine - pur nell’illusoria
          luce di un progresso tecnologico - allo stesso meccanismo
          auto-degenerativo che ha distrutto e sprofondato la civiltà di
          Atlantide: un abuso scellerato della Conoscenza.</i> </p>
      <p>What has been kept hidden from time immemore and what man has
        been denied as <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; right to information and choice
        now ranges revealed. The work of Ighina will allow us to wrest
        the <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; veil of ignorance and know
        harmony and intelligence celestial spaces, where wisdom is <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pure alchemy of the elements. The
        only interest of those who possess such alchemy is not the
        power, <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is not control, nor the use of
        evil forces, but only Love. Ighina always <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; claims that it is not enough to
        discover new sources of energy, if there is profound knowledge
        of <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; balance of forces: "Everything
        must be done in full respect of Nature, strictly <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; controlled by a wise mind and
        harmonious where science and belief are the coordinates <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; absolute. "So we have to
        eliminate the split between science and belief, because <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; separation of these essential
        coordinates would give rise - while nell'illusoria light of a <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; technological progress - the same
        mechanism self-degenerative that has destroyed and <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sprofondato the civilization of

      </p>
      <p>Pier Luigi Ighina, ricercatore originale e prolifico, per molti
        anni assistente segreto di Guglielmo Marconi. </p>
      <p>Nato nel 1908 a Milano, di professione radiotecnico, nel 1936
        si trasferisce ad Imola e nella sua abitazione istalla un
        laboratorio dalle caratteristiche assai strane, frutto delle sue
        particolari conoscenze che tramuta in numerose invenzioni.
        Ighina a 16 anni scoprì l’atomo magnetico e, attraverso una
        serie di fortunate peripezie, arrivò a collaborare segretamente
        con Marconi per almeno 10 anni. Anche dopo la scomparsa dello
        scienziato, Ighina ha continuato nella ricerca per tutta la sua
        lunga vita, basata sulla spirale che è il movimento
        dell’energia. </p>
      <p>Parlando con lui ad Imola, ho potuto scoprire la parte
        misteriosa di Marconi, soprattutto sul raggio della morte. A
        Villa Marconi, Ighina riuscì per puro caso a scoprire
        sperimentalmente il monopolo magnetico. Dopo aver studiato a
        fondo il campo magnetico, generato da alcune elettrocalamite e
        dal quale non riusciva a concludere il suo progetto, Ighina,
        preso da uno strano nervosismo, mise tanta di quella corrente
        elettrica da determinare la bruciatura totale del congegno. La
        meraviglia fu tanta perché non avvenne nulla di tutto questo. Fu
        proprio Guglielmo Marconi a chiarire l’esperimento: era stato
        inventato il monopolo magnetico. Secondo la sua definizione, il
        monopolo magnetico non è altro che la divisione dell’atomo
        magnetico. A tal riguardo Ighina ha detto: </p>
      <p>"Avevo così costatato che l’atomo magnetico è il promotore di
        tutti gli altri atomi. In altre parole avevo notato che l’atomo
        magnetico si trova in mezzo agli altri atomi per dar loro il
        movimento continuo. Pensai che se si fosse riusciti ad isolare
        gli atomi della materia dagli atomi magnetici, i primi non
        avrebbero più la possibilità di muoversi. E questo ottenni: gli
        atomi della materia isolati da quelli magnetici rimanevano fermi
        e la materia non si trasformava. Pensai allora che se l’atomo
        magnetico poteva influenzare tutti gli atomi esistenti, avrebbe
        anche potuto produrre tutte le variazioni degli atomi della
        materia. E anche ciò costatai dopo essere riuscito a regolare il
        movimento dell’atomo magnetico." </p>
      <p>Questo è l’atomo magnetico che è stato fotografato nel
        laboratorio di Pier Luigi Ighina nell’anno 1940, per mezzo di un
        microscopio atomico, con ingrandimento dell’atomo di un miliardo
        di volte. </p>
      <p>Nella foto dell'atomo magnetico si vedono i cinque canaletti
        d’atomi assorbenti che servono a frenare l’atomo magnetico; nel
        centro si nota la dilatazione prodotta dalla pulsazione
        dell’atomo stesso. </p>
      <p>Ognuna di queste pulsazioni produce e lancia attorno all’atomo
        magnetico un’energia, che nella foto è raffigurata dal sottile
        circoletto luminoso attorno all’atomo centrale. Il circoletto
        luminoso si espande a sua volta tanto da formare un circolo più
        grande così fino all’esaurimento della sua pulsazione. Il
        susseguirsi dei circoletti generati dalle pulsazioni produce
        l’adagiamento dei circoletti stessi uno sempre più vicino
        dell’altro, come a coprire e nascondere completamente, come uno
        scudo protettivo, l’atomo centrale. Quest’atomo è il più piccolo
        di tutti gli altri atomi e per legge atomica più piccolo è
        l’atomo più veloce è la sua pulsazione. Esso è quello che
        imprime a tutti gli altri atomi il loro movimento diventando
        così promotore di essi. (Informazioni riprese dal libro: "La
        scoperta dell’atomo magnetico" di P.L.Ighina). </p>
      <p>Tornando al concetto di monopolo, ho chiesto direttamente a lui
        spiegazioni più dettagliate. Il signor Ighina ha così risposto:
      </p>
      <p>"Il monopolo è il principio positivo o negativo dell’energia
        solare. L’energia solare è la parte principale della polarità;
        bloccandola e riflettendola, diventa negativa. L’energia solare
        arriva sulla Terra, viene bloccata e riflessa e quindi diventa
        energia terrestre. Dall’interazione dell’energia solare con
        quella terrestre si produce materia. Tutto qui. Semplice no?" </p>
      <p>Ho chiesto poi come avevano, lui e Marconi, applicato la
        conoscenza sul monopolo. La risposta è stata immediata e
        scioccante: </p>
      <p>"Difatti Marconi è morto per quello. Io ero dal ’36 che abitavo
        già qui ad Imola. Glielo avevo detto: 'Mi raccomando Guglielmo,
        telefona se hai bisogno di fare qualche esperimento, mi
        raccomando...'. Lo avevo già salvato due volte. In una stavo per
        rimetterci la pelle anch’io. Perché lui adoperava i monopoli con
        facilità. E i monopoli cosa fanno? Fanno la scomposizione della
        materia sulla materia stessa. Lui ha fatto l’esperimento e c’è
        rimasto. Si, effettivamente aveva messo lo schermo magnetico, ma
        non era sufficiente. Quando sono andato a Roma a vederlo nella
        bara, ho notato che egli aveva sotto la pelle come degli
        gnocchetti neri. Allora ho capito che era morto perché non era
        più circolato il sangue. I medici avevano detto che aveva una
        cosa nel cuore, come la chiamano loro? Boh... Tutti dicevano che
        Marconi era morto di Angina Pectoris..." </p>
      <p>Detto questo, egli ha continuato con la sua spiegazione: </p>
      <p>"Ho portato avanti tutto quello che Marconi mi ha lasciato. I
        monopoli, la composizione della materia, le lumache, ecc.. Ho
        ripetuto tutto quello che mi diceva quando era vivo." <br>
        Ighina mi ha spiegato poi che la materia è tenuta insieme dalla
        colla magnetica. Le due energie, solare e terrestre, producono
        la colla magnetica. Quindi la differenza sostanziale tra due
        materie di diversa natura consiste nel possedere più o meno
        energia. È come il cemento. Se nell’impasto si mette molto
        cemento, la materia diventa più dura; se ne viene messo poco
        allora si ottiene una materia morbida. Mi è nata spontanea, a
        questo punto, una domanda sulle energie nucleari, come tutte le
        energie elettromagnetiche, generate dalla nostra società attuale
        possono causare danni irreparabili. </p>
      <p>Ighina, con la massima cortesia, ha dato la seguente risposta:
      </p>
      <p>"Non è che disturbano. Dunque... la colla magnetica è formata
        da due energie, come dei fili invisibili che sono nell’aria. Se
        questi fili invisibili sono perturbati in continuazione da
        qualsiasi altra sostanza come i campi magnetici, telefoni,
        energia nucleare e cose similari, creano continuamente della
        corrosione vale a dire vanno a distruggere il campo magnetico
        che è poi quello che crea la colla magnetica. Ciò produce lo
        scioglimento della materia." </p>
      <p>Ho potuto visitare il suo laboratorio e tutte le varie
        apparecchiature da lui costruite. È stato per me un incontro
        proficuo, ma ho avuto netta l’impressione che il signor Ighina
        avesse rivelato una minima quantità delle sue conoscenze e che
        non avesse voluto parlare assolutamente dei suoi più importanti
        esperimenti. L’ultima occasione è stata la visita nel suo
        giardino di una macchina capace di controllare le nuvole nel
        cielo. Mentre aspettavamo che il cielo si aprisse per effetto
        dell’energia sprigionata dalla macchina attraverso le sue due
        pale rotanti, Ighina mi ha raccontato molti fatti, molti
        aneddoti sulla sua lunga sperimentazione. Mi ha infine fatto
        notare che sotto il terreno di sua appartenenza ha sepolto
        diversi quintali di polvere d’alluminio per trasformare il prato
        in un grande monopolo magnetico. Ho potuto dedurre poi che i
        suoi studi, effettuati nella collaborazione con Guglielmo
        Marconi, hanno portato alla seguente considerazione: unendo o
        separando i monopoli si può comporre o scomporre la materia. </p>
      <p>Questi due ricercatori hanno però scelto diverse strade per
        promuovere le scoperte suddette. Marconi si è inserito nella
        logica terrestre e non si è potuto esimere dall’influenza del
        potere politico, economico, militare e religioso. Ighina invece
        è rimasto nell’ombra, consapevole che se l’umanità avesse
        cambiato la sua logica di vita, poteva tranquillamente esprimere
        le proprie conoscenze per il benessere dell’umanità stessa. </p>
      <p>La morte misteriosa di Marconi innescò un’altra leggenda che lo
        volle in Sud America insieme con altri 98 scienziati (incluso il
        suo fedelissimo Landini) per costruire una città segreta nel
        cratere spento di un vulcano situato nella giungla nel sud del
        Venezuela. Marconi, del resto, aveva lasciato un filone di
        studio che, nonostante le varie situazioni contingenti, si
        basava sull’amore per la natura. Egli desiderava che l’uomo
        seguisse gli insegnamenti dei Maestri e si sforzasse di capire
        Madre Natura e le sue esigenze. Se questo si realizzasse,
        sicuramente non ci sarebbero più catastrofi e il pericolo della
        scomparsa della vita sulla Terra. Nikola Tesla si trovò nella
        stessa condizione di Marconi, ma anche lui non cedette alle
        lusinghe del potere. Per puri scopi propagandistici le dicerie
        su raggi d’ogni genere si diffusero durante la seconda guerra
        mondiale ed anche dopo. Ciò non toglie che alcuni scienziati
        avessero intuito e probabilmente realizzato veramente qualcosa
        che avrebbe potuto cambiare definitivamente il corso della
        storia. Emerge però che nei quattro personaggi citati la loro
        coscienza abbia evidenziato il fatto che l’uomo non era ancora
        in grado di usufruire una generosa sorte e perciò ognuno di loro
        ha trovato un rimedio adeguato per non diffondere una probabile
        arma globale. Sono stati amanti della vita e naturalmente
        codesta invenzione doveva salvare l’umanità e non distruggerla.

      <p><i>Pier Luigi Ighina,&nbsp; allievo e collaboratore di
          Guglielmo Marconi, è uno scienziato pressoché sconosciuto al
          pubblico, perché le sue scoperte ed invenzioni non hanno
          ottenuto alcun riconoscimento dalla scienza ufficiale ma che,
          qualora fossero prese in considerazione, potrebbero (secondo
          il Reiki master Giuseppe Zanella, che ha curato l'introduzione
          del libro) cambiare radicalmente la vita dell'uomo. Nel libro,
          suddiviso nelle due sezioni teoria (I) e tecnica (II),
          l'Autore descrive le sue ricerche nel campo della fisica
          dell'atomo, in particolare la scoperta dell'atomo magnetico.</i>
      </p>
      <p>Pier Luigi Ighina, student and assistant to Guglielmo Marconi,
        is a scientist almost unknown to the public, because his
        discoveries and inventions have not obtained any official
        recognition by science but which, if taken into account, could
        (according to the Reiki master Joseph Zanella, who took care of
        the introduction of the book) radically change human life. In
        the book, divided into two sections theory (I) and technical
        (II), the author describes his research in the field of physics
        of the atom, in particular the discovery of the magnetic atom. </p>
      <p><i>Ighina affronta lo studio dell'atomo da una prospettiva
          alquanto diversa rispetto agli altri ricercatori; infatti
          invece di sottoporre l'atomo all'azione di potenti campi
          magnetici o di particelle ad alta energia, decide di contenere
          il suo movimento utilizzando altri atomi, definiti assorbenti,
          che impediscono agli atomi luce e a quelli esterni di
          interferire nell'osservazione.</i> </p>
      <p>Ighina tackles the study the atom from a perspective quite
        different compared to other researchers, because instead of
        subjecting the atom to powerful magnetic fields or particles
        high-energy, decides to contain his movement using other atoms,
        defined towel, that prevent atoms to light and those external to
        interfere nell'osservazione. </p>
      <p><i>Attraverso questo "geniale" accorgimento e mediante il
          microscopio atomico lenticolare di sua invenzione, Ighina è
          riuscito a classificare varie categorie di atomi in base alle
          loro differenti pulsazioni.</i> </p>
      <p><i>Un concetto importante che l'Autore intende sottolineare è
          che "l'atomo non oscilla, ma vibra, non si può dividerlo,
          sarebbe però possibile dividere la sua energia ma non l'atomo
          stesso". La scoperta dell'atomo magnetico avviene casualmente
          come scrive lo stesso Ighina: "ero intento a queste prove
          quando, spostando inavvertitamente una calamita lì vicina,
          vidi che tutti gli atomi in osservazione e i cataletti di
          assorbimento si erano messi vertiginosamente in movimento
          scomparendo poi in una massa luminosa". L'atomo magnetico
          (vedi foto) è il più piccolo rispetto agli altri atomi,
          possiede una pulsazione più veloce ed inoltre ha la
          caratteristica di "imprimere il movimento a tutti gli altri
          atomi, diventando così il promotore di essi".</i> </p>
      <p>Through this "ingenious" trick and through his invention of the
        atomic lenticular microscope, Ighina was able to classify
        different categories of atoms according to their different
        pulsations. </p>
      <p>An important concept that the author wishes to stress is that
        "the atom not fluctuates, but vibrates, one can not divide it,
        but it would be possible to divide its energy but not the atom
        itself. " The magnetic atom&nbsp; discovery occurs randomly as
        the same Ighina writes: "I was intent on these tests when,
        inadvertently moving a magnet near there, I saw that all the
        atoms in [ cataletti ] observation and absorption were
        dramatically moving then disappearing into a mass of light. "The
        magnetic atom (see photo) is the smallest compared the other
        atoms, has afaster&nbsp; pulse and also has the characteristic
        of "effecting movement to all other atoms, thus becoming the
        promoter of them. " </p>
      <p><i>Una delle apparecchiature costruite da Ighina, il regolatore
          di vibrazioni atomiche magnetiche, si basa proprio
          sull'energia dell'atomo magnetico e più precisamente sulla
          variazione della frequenza di vibrazione della materia con la
          trasformazione della stessa.</i> </p>
      <p><i>Con questa energia è possibile, a detta dell'Autore, guarire
          qualsiasi malattia, fondere i metalli a distanza, produrre
          energia elettrica, neutralizzare le radiazioni, investigare il
          sottosuolo alla ricerca di giacimenti petroliferi&nbsp; o
          falde acquifere, aumentare i raccolti agricoli ed altro
          ancora.</i> </p>
      <p>One of equipments built by Ighina, the regulator of nuclear
        magnetic vibrations, [ basa ] own magnetic energy the atom and
        more precisely on the variation in the frequency vibration of
        matter with the transformation of itself. </p>
      <p>With this energy is possible, according to the Author, cure any
        disease, to melt metals distance, produce electricity,
        neutralize radiation, investigating the underground research of
        oil or aquifers, raising agricultural crops and more. </p>
      <p><i>È indubbio che il campo magnetico sia fondamentale per la
          vita sulla Terra, ma la scoperta di come sia possibile la
          trasformazione della materia e la produzione di monopoli
          magnetici risulta piuttosto difficile da credere. Se così
          fosse, ci troveremmo di fronte alla chiave di comprensione
          della natura e dei suoi meccanismi.</i> </p>
      <p><i>Nella foto, scattata da P.L. Ighina nel 1940 con il
          microscopio atomico lenticolare, viene ripreso l'atomo
          magnetico, con i cinque cataletti di atomi assorbenti. L'atomo
          produce una pulsazione che si espande dal centro ed è
          rappresentata da un sottile circoletto luminoso.</i> </p>
      <p>There is no doubt that the magnetic field is essential to life
        on Earth, but the discovery of how it is possible the
        transformation of matter and the production of magnetic
        monopolies is rather difficult to believe. If so, we would be
        facing the key to understanding of nature and its mechanisms. </p>
      <p>The photograph, taken by P.L. Ighina in 1940 with the
        microscope Atomic lenticular is taken the atom magnetic, toweled
        with five [ cataletti ] of atoms. The atom produces a pulse that
        expands from the center and is represented by a thin bright
        circle. </p>

        <p><b>Dott. Alberto Nigi</b></p>
      </center>
      <p><b><i>PREMESSA</i></b> </p>
      <p><i>Ciò che segue rappresenta la sintesi dì quanto, assieme ad
          un gruppo di amici, ho personalmente ricavato dall’incontro e
          dai colloqui con Pier Luigi Ighina. Questa relazione vuole
          anche essere un resoconto particolareggiato delle esperienze
          vissute da me e dal gruppo che mi accompagnava ad Imola,
          (presso la fattoria di Via Romeo galli, 4) il giorno martedì
          12 settembre 1972. Essendo testimone diretto (costantemente
          affiancato da coloro che mi accompagnavano) ho riportato tutto
          quanto mi è parso più importante e significativo dei fatti
          accaduti nel corso della mia permanenza sul posto.</i> </p>
      <p><b>BACKGROUND</b> </p>
      <p>What follows is a summary day since, along with a group of
        friends, I personally derived from and discussions with Pier
        Luigi Ighina. This report will also be a&nbsp; detailed report
        on the experiences lived by me and by the group that accompanied
        me in Imola (at the farm of Via Romeo, 4) the day Tuesday,
        September 12, 1972. Being witness direct (constantly flanked by
        those who accompanied me) I have given everything to me it
        seemed more important and significant events during my stay on
        the spot. </p>
      <p><b><i>SITUAZIONE</i></b> </p>
      <p><i>Pier Luigi Ighina parla di un suo accordo con i pi1oti di
          una “cellula magnetica spaziale cosmica” (disco volante - UFO)
          comandata dall’extraterrestre “Scegustori”. Sulla base di tali
          accordi egli si era fiduciosamente prefisso, tramite appositi
          dispositivi da lui stesso realizzati (“stroboscopio
          magnetico”), di creare un corridoio elettromagnetico a forma
          di spirale conica rivolta verso l'alto ed ortogonale al piano
          tangente alla sfera celeste nel punto zenitale. Tale corridoio
          doveva servire per due scopi ben precisi:</i> </p>
      <p><b>SITUATION</b> </p>
      <p>Pier Luigi Ighina speaks of his agreement with pilots of a
        "cosmic magnetic space cell " (flying saucer - UFO) commanded by
        the extraterrestrial "Scegustori." Based on these confidential
        agreements he had&nbsp; made a "magnetic stroboscope" , to
        create a electromagnetic spiral-shaped conical corridor side up
        and orthogonal to the plane tangent to the celestial sphere at
        the zenith. This corridor was to serve for two very specific
        purposes: </p>
      <p><i>1) Doveva servire da “sentiero magnetico” per
          l'avvicinamento a terra del “disco volante”, il quale, com’è
          spesso ricordato da vari studiosi anche ufologi, funzionerebbe
          e si muoverebbe sfruttando l'energia elettromagnetica del
          campo terrestre secondo le cosiddette rotte ortoteniche.1</i>
      </p>
      <p>1) It had to serve as "magnetic path" for approaching a land of
        "flying saucer", which, as is often stated by several scholars
        also ufologists, work and move by exploiting energy
        electromagnetic field so-called second land routes&nbsp; (ley
        lines).1 </p>
      <p><i>2) Doveva erigere una cortina di energia protettiva nei
          confronti dell’ambiente circostante poiché la “cellula
          magnetica cosmica” in questione avrebbe emesso energia
          magnetico-luminosa ad altissimo potenziale, in grado di
          disintegrare la materia fino ad un raggio di trecento metri.
          Tuttavia, secondo quanto affermato dallo stesso costruttore,
          il campo magnetico creato dallo “stroboscopio magnetico”
          avrebbe determinato ripercussioni fino ad un raggio di trenta
          chilometri. Insomma, il suo flusso avrebbe influenzato tutta
          la zona circostante provocando fenomeni insoliti in tutte le
          apparecchiature elettriche. Si pensava persino che le
          automobili non sarebbero riuscite a partire a causa, come
          affermato dallo stesso Ighina, della “staticizzazione del
          magnete”.2 Avrebbero poi potuto verificarsi fenomeni strani di
          natura meteorologica, coinvolgenti una vasta area territoriale
          fino a varie città circostanti.3</i> </p>
      <p>2) He had to erect a protective curtain of energy towards the
        environment surrounding because "cosmic magnetic cell" in
        question was issued-magnetic energy to light highest potential,
        capable of disintegrate the matter up to a radius of three
        hundred metres.&nbsp; However, according to a statement by him,
        the magnetic field created by the "Magnetic Stroboscope" would
        lead to repercussions up to a radius of thirty km. In short, his
        influence would flow throughout the surrounding area causing
        unusual phenomena in all electrical appliances. It was thought
        that even cars not would be able to leave because, as stated by
        the same Ighina, of "the magnetic static".2 They then could
        occur strange phenomena of nature weather, covering a wide
        territorial area to various cities.3 </p>
      <p><i>Questo macchinario di Ighina, chiamato appunto “stroboscopio
          magnetico”, aveva il compito di opacizzare da un certo punto
          in poi l'energia emessa dal “disco volante”, bloccandola e
          limitandola ad un raggio di qualche metro in modo da
          permettergli di mostrarsi al pubblico per essere osservato e
          fotografato.</i> <br>
        &nbsp; </p>
      <p>2 Ighina's machine, called "stroboscopio magnetic", had the
        task of [ opacizzare ] from a certain point on the energy
        emitted by the "flying saucer", and [ bloccandola ] limited to a
        radius of a few meters so as to enable him to show to the public
        for be observed and photographed. </p>
      <p><i>Probabilmente, secondo quanto comunicato dagli
          extraterrestri, non era tecnicamente opportuno che il “disco
          volante” appoggiasse definitivamente a terra, ma doveva
          soltanto librarsi all'altezza dello “stroboscopio magnetico”.
          Probabl1mente il “disco volante” per atterrare avrebbe dovuto
          disattivare la sua energia onde non creare una distruzione
          totale per un raggio abbastanza vasto. Inoltre, poiché tale
          energia costituirebbe il guscio protettivo di queste
          astronavi, disattivandola la navicella rimarrebbe indifesa e
          quindi vulnerabile. Insomma, secondo le dichiarazioni di
          Ighina, quando l'atterraggio è preannunciato non è prudente
          eliminare tale energia protettiva, perché il “disco volante”
          si sottoporrebbe al rischio di essere colpito o catturato da
          qualche insulsa potenza mi1itare terrestre.</i> </p>
      <p>Probably, as reported by extraterrestrials, was not technically
        appropriate that the "flying saucer" [ appoggiasse ]
        definitively on the ground, but was only at [ librarsi ] of the
        "magnetic stroboscopio." Probably the "flying saucer" to land
        should have disable its energy so as to avoid creating a total
        destruction within a radius large enough. Moreover, since such
        energy would be the protective shell of these ships, the [
        disattivandola ] ship would remain unprotected and therefore
        vulnerable. In short, according to the statements of Ighina,
        when the landing is announced is not prudent to eliminate such
        energy protective, because the "Flying saucer" is subject to the
        risk of being struck or caught somewhere [ insulsa
        ]terrestrial&nbsp; military power. </p>
      <p><i>Pier Luigi Ighina ha sempre avuto una particolare
          disposizione allo studio della fenomenologia elettromagnetica
          e molta capacità nella esecuzione di meccanismi attinenti. Ma,
          stando a quanto egli racconta, molte informazioni e
          suggerimenti g1i sono giunti direttamente dalle intelligenze
          extraterrestri, vivamente interessate da queste sue attitudini
          e dalla profondità delle sue intuizioni in quel settore
          tecnico-scientifico. È naturale però che non gli avrebbero
          rivelato numerosi ed importanti segreti sull’elettromagnetismo
          se non fossero stati più che sicuri della sua integrità
          morale, del suo buon temperamento semplice e cordiale di
          pacifista. Ighina racconta che il suo incontro con gli
          extraterrestri è avvenuto quasi dieci anni prima, sul monte
          Castellaccio presso Imola. Oggi egli è convinto di essere un
          “programmato” e che il suo compito sia quello di portare
          avanti una missione importante, quella di rigenerazione
          dell'umanità nel bene. Egli, dunque, avrebbe il compito di
          gettare il seme atto a germogliare nel cuore degli uomini per
          renderli migliori. Se gli uomini non cambieranno e non si
          adegueranno al ritmo vitale della natura invece di
          distruggerla, afferma Ighina, essi dovranno soccombere di
          fronte alla finale azione purificatrice dei Messaggeri della
          Armonia Cosmica. Anche prima però Ighina si era mostrato
          eccezionale ed abi1issimo nella sua professione di tecnico. Si
          dice che riuscisse ad individuare i guasti nelle
          apparecchiature elettriche senza bisogno di alcuna
          strumentazione. Sembra che gli bastasse soltanto la punta
          delle dita per scoprire il punto e la natura del guasto.</i> </p>
      <p>Pier Luigi Ighina has always had a special provision to the
        study of phenomenology Electromagnetic and a lot of capacity in
        the execution of related mechanisms. But, according to he says,
        a lot of information and suggestions came directly from
        intelligence extraterrestrials, strongly affected by these
        attitudes and the depth of its insights in that sector Technical
        and Scientific. Of course not, however, that would have revealed
        numerous important secrets of electromagnetism if they had not
        been more than confident of his moral integrity moral, of his
        good temperament, of simple and friendly pacifism. Ighina
        recounts that his meeting with extraterrestrials took place
        almost ten years before, on the mountain at Castellaccio Imola.
        Today he is convinced of being a "planned" and that his task is
        to bring pursuing an important mission, that of regeneration of
        humanity into the well. He, therefore, would have the task of
        planting the seed act to sprout in the hearts of men to make
        them best. If men do not change and do not adjust to the pace of
        vital nature instead of destroy it, says Ighina, they will
        succumb before the final action of purifying Messengers of
        Cosmic Harmony. Even though the first Ighina had shown
        exceptional ability in his technical profession. They say he was
        able to identify failures in electrical without any
        instrumentation. It seems that only the tip of your finger is
        enough to discover the point and nature of the malfunction. </p>
      <p><i>Si racconta che da piccolo gli nascondevano per casa delle
          calamite e lui, tramite la sua sensibilità magnetica, ad una
          ad una le trovava tutte.</i> </p>
      <p><i>Ighina afferma, poi, che è stata la Madonna ad ispirarlo
          nello studio dei fenomeni elettromagnetici. Egli sostiene che
          proprio nell’elettromagnet1smo sta il nocciolo dell'esistenza
          e della natura. Ma Pier Luigi Ighina, un uomo buono come il
          pane e semplice come un fanciullo, per quanto infaticabi1e
          resta pur sempre un uomo. Pur lavorando persino nelle ore
          notturne assieme ai suoi validi col1aboratori e dietro le
          precise istruzioni provenienti dal cielo si è accorto di
          essere rimasto indietro nella costruzione del meccanismo
          progettato. I tempi sono stati accelerati, la costruzione si è
          fatta quasi frenetica e conseguentemente frettolosa.</i> </p>
      <p>It is said that as a child, thye hid magnets in the house he,
        through its sensitivity magnetic, found them all. </p>
      <p>Ighina says, then, that was the Madonna to inspire in the study
        of phenomena electromagnetic. He argues that the electromagnet
        is the crux of the existence and of nature. But Pier Luigi
        Ighina, a good man and simple as a child, as [infatigablecabile]
        still a man. While working even at night together with his
        collaborators and behind the precise instructions from the sky
        has noticed to be lagging behind in the construction of the
        mechanism designed. The times were accelerated the construction
        has made almost frantic and hurried accordingly. </p>
      <p><b><i>FATTI</i></b> </p>
      <p><i>Vediamo, ora, che cosa realmente è accaduto ad Imola il
          giorno martedì 12 settembre 1972 nei campi della fattoria di
          Ighina che si trova in Viale Romeo Galli, 4, ove egli ha
          sistemato il suo laboratorio. Lunedì 11 Settembre, alle ore
          ventuno, arrivato ad Imola in compagnia di alcuni amici, lo
          trovo mentre sta lavorando accanitamente. Tuttavia, per il suo
          carattere fraterno, per il suo spirito familiare di buon
          romagnolo, perde tempo prezioso in una calorosa accoglienza.
          Ci fornisce ampie spiegazioni sulla natura e il funzionamento
          di alcune macchine da lui realizzate. Alle ore ventidue
          decidiamo di lasciarlo lavorare in pace e ce ne andiamo a
          cena. Torniamo al laboratorio quando già le 23.30
          preannunziano l'arrivo del fatidico 12 settembre. Ighina sta
          ancora lavorando. Noi lo osserviamo mentre si dà da fare in
          mezzo ai suoi stranissimi congegni. Ci avvisa che prima del
          mezzogiorno dell'indomani non avrebbe dato via
          all’esperimento. Per le lancette dei nostri orologi scocca già
          l’una di notte ed è già il 12 settembre. Noi ce ne andiamo a
          dormire mentre egli resta lì a lavorare, assieme ad alcuni fra
          i suoi più infaticabili e fedeli collaboratori.</i> </p>
      <p><b>FACTS</b> </p>
      <p>Let's see now what really happened in Imola on Tuesday,
        September 12, 1972 in fields of Ighina's farm, which is located
        in Viale Romeo Galli, 4, where he placed his laboratory. Monday,
        11 September, at twenty-one, arrived at Imola in the company of
        some friends.. There provides extensive explanations about the
        nature and operation of certain machines made by him. At
        twenty-two hours we decide to leave work in peace and we go to
        dinner. Let us return to when the laboratory already 23.30 [
        preannunziano ] the arrival of the fateful September 12. Ighina
        is still working. We observe while giving be done in the midst
        of his [ stranissimi ] devices. It warns that before noon [
        dell'indomani ] would not have given away in the experiment. For
        hands of our body clocks already one night and is already on
        September 12. We go there to sleep while he remains there to
        work, along with some of his most tireless and faithful
        collaborators. </p>
      <p><i>La mattina del 12 settembre ci alziamo un po’ tardi. Sono
          già passate le 10.30 quando arriviamo al laboratorio. Nutriamo
          la speranza che i lavori vengano ultimati in tempo, ma veniamo
          informati che restano ancora da eseguire gli ultimi ritocchi.
          Il lavoro è ritardato del continuo arrivo dei visitatori che
          in verità sono numerosi e provengono dalle più varie città
          italiane. C’è chi viene anche dall’estero. Ighina si perde a
          parlare con tutti, ma il suo lavoro sembra ormai ultimato: è
          quasi mezzogiorno. Il dispositivo, lo “stroboscopio magnetico”
          comincia a funzionare, ma ha bisogno di almeno tre ore
          d’alimentazione per accumulare le cariche capaci di creare il
          campo energetico ottimale. Il primo inconveniente, assai
          banale, si verifica poco dopo le 12,30. È la puleggia di un
          motorino elettrico che non funziona bene. Si tratta di una
          cosa da nulla, ma richiede tempo perché deve essere
          sostituita. Bisogna togliere la vecchia, mandare a prendere la
          nuova e rimontarla. Intanto Ighina annuncia che il “disco
          volante”, ha comunicato di trovarsi già a quattromila metri
          d'altitudine e che sarebbe sceso non appena lo “stroboscopio
          magnetico”, funzionante, avesse determinato il campo magnetico
          fino alla condizione ottimale atta alla discesa.</i> </p>
      <p>On the morning of September 12 we raise a little 'late. I'm
        already past 10.30 am when we arrive the laboratory. We hope
        that the work is completed on time, but we are informed which
        remain to be run the finishing touches. The work has delayed the
        continuous arrival of Visitors who are indeed numerous and come
        from more different Italian cities. Some people are also from
        abroad. Ighina is lost to talk with everyone, but his work seems
        now completed: almost noon. The device, the "magnetic
        stroboscope" has started to work, but needs at least three hours
        of power to accumulate charges able to create the field optimal
        energy. The first incident, very trivial, occurs shortly after
        12.30. It is the pulley an electric motor that does not work
        well. .. We must remove the old, ad install the new. Meanwhile
        Ighina announces that the "flying saucer", announced that he is
        already four thousand meters of altitude and that would be
        dropped as soon as the "magnetic stroboscopio" running, had
        determined the magnetic field until the optimal condition likely
        to drop. </p>
      <p><i>Intanto, da fuori, arriva la notizia che ventisette RADAR
          dell’Aviazione Militare sono puntati sull’oggetto volante.
          Poco dopo, due reattori caccia militari sorvolano a bassa
          quota la nostra zona e poi puntano decisi verso l’alto. Non si
          è fatto caso se si trattasse di aerei italiani o americani o
          francesi, ma sicuramente appartenevano alle forze NATO.
          Intanto in casa di Ighina, tra i visitatori c'è anche un alto
          funzionario di polizia. Sappiamo che fuori, per strada,
          gironzolano carabinieri in borghese. Ma il laboratorio è
          aperto a tutti: lì non ci sono veri e propri segreti e anche
          le spie perderebbero la loro caratteristica di spie,
          diventando semplici osservatori come tutti gli altri. Secondo
          me, l'unico vero segreto è quello che è racchiuso nella mente
          di Ighina, che lui dice di aver ricevuto dagli extraterrestri
          e che lui non può rivelare perché l’umanità, oggigiorno così
          perversa, non ne farebbe altro che strumento di guerra e di
          distruzione. In effetti, il segreto è molto semplice, ma
          consiste nel più grande enigma che attualmente si presenti
          alla problematica delle scienze fisiche: polarizzare
          univocamente un campo elettromagnetico, separandone le cariche
          ed usando indifferentemente e separatamente le positive o le
          negative. È forse nell'essenza di questo principio che si cela
          la risoluzione del problema del1’antigrav1tà e forse anche
          dell'antimateria. È forse questa la strada per giungere a
          quanto già era stato scoperto da Ettore Majorana nel 1938
          prima della sua misteriosa scomparsa. A questo punto ci sembra
          lecito pensare che anche Ettore Majorana sia stato invitato
          dagli Extraterrestri a collaborare con loro nel segreto di una
          delle loro numerose basi sparse, come sembra, sulla Terra.
          Ighina sostiene che quando la coscienza dell'uomo sarà
          mig1iore (se sarà in grado di migliorare), allora lui rivelerà
          i1 suo segreto. Solo allora l'uomo romperà quello schermo
          negativo che lo rende cieco e potrà armonizzare con la natura,
          capirne i segreti e quindi dominarla rispettandola.</i> </p>
      <p>Meanwhile, from outside, comes the news that twenty-seven of
        Aviation Military RADAR are bulleted on the wheel. Shortly
        afterwards, two military fighter fets flying at low altitude our
        area and then decided pointing upward. No case is made whether
        they were Italian or air American or French, but certainly
        belonged to NATO. Meanwhile in the house of Ighina, among
        visitors there is also a senior police officer. We know that out
        on the street, [ gironzolano ] plainclothes police. But the lab
        is open to all: there are no real secrets and LEDs also lose
        their characteristic of spies, becoming mere observers as all
        others. In my opinion, the only real secret is what is contained
        in the minds of Ighina, he says he received from
        extraterrestrials and that he can not reveal because humanity
        today so evil, there would only instrument of war and
        destruction. In fact, the secret is very simple, but consists in
        the biggest conundrum that currently presents problems of the
        physical sciences: polarise uniquely an electromagnetic field,
        the separate the charges and using indifferently and separately
        the positive or negative. It is perhaps the essence of this
        principle that hides the resolution of the problem and perhaps
        of antigravity and antimatter.. Was that the way to achieve what
        already had been discovered by Ettore Majorana in 1938 before
        his mysterious disappearance. At this point it seems reasonable
        to think that even Ettore Majorana has been invited by
        Extraterrestrials to collaborate with them in the secret of one
        of their many bases scattered, as it seems, on Earth. Ighina
        argues that when the conscience of man will [ migliore ] (if it
        can improve), then he will reveal his secret. Only then man
        break that screen negative which makes it blind and could
        harmonize with nature, understand the secrets and then dominate
        it responsibly. </p>
      <p><i>Sono già le ore 13: il cielo si rannuvola sempre più e si
          preannuncia cattivo tempo. Ighina però, con un sorriso
          divertito dice che ciò non ha importanza e di non temere. Si
          dice, infatti, che egli sia in grado di richiamare o
          allontanare i temporali. Allora, la famosa danza della pioggia
          degli indiani d’America non era altro che la creazione di un
          campo magnetico particolare? Ovvero di un campo magnetico di
          segno opposto a quello delle nuvole e delle particelle umide
          dell'aria, di modo che esse si radunavano e si condensavano al
          punto da provocare la pioggia?</i> </p>
      <p>There are already 13 hours: the sky is increasingly [ rannuvola
        [ and foretells bad weather. Ighina however, with an amused
        smile says that this is unimportant and not to worry. They say,
        in fact, that he is able to recall or remove thunderstorms.
        Then, the famous dance of the rain Indians of America was not
        merely the creation of a magnetic field? Or of a magnetic field
        of opposite sign to that of clouds and wet air, so that they
        gathere and condense to cause the rain? </p>
      <p><i>Mentre i collaboratori sono tutti impegnati nella
          riparazione del guasto alla puleggia, Ighina è a disposizione
          del pubblico e piega le sue teorie sull’elettromagnetismo con
          tutte le loro varie applicazioni. Mostra poi i risultati
          ottenuti in varie esperienze: chicchi di grano grossi come
          quelli del granturco, pesche grosse il triplo rispetto a
          quelle normali e così via, di cui ci vengono distribuite le
          foto.</i> </p>
      <p>While all employees are engaged in the repair of failure to
        pulley, is Ighina available to the public and fold his theories
        electromagnetism with all their various applications. See then
        the results obtained in various experiences: grains of corn as
        big ones maize, peaches big three than normal and so forth,
        which we are distributed photos. </p>
      <p><i>Ighina ci mostra anche alcune ampolline piene di polvere e
          di varie pietruzze lunari, che chissà dove potrà mai aver
          preso. Egli sostiene di aver utilizzato un certo apparecchio
          da lui costruito, ma probabi1mente qui gli Extraterrestri ne
          sanno qualcosa... Naturalmente quelle ampolline non sono in
          cassaforte, ma lì, abbandonate su un tavolo, a vista di tutti,
          senza, barriere, reti o congegni antifurto. Nessuno si
          sognerebbe di rubarle perché nessuno ci crede sul serio che
          sia davvero materiale lunare perché dicono che Ighina è
          “matto”. Allora, secondo me, se Ighina è un “matto” è comunque
          un “matto”che parla e agisce come un saggio e tanto dovrebbe
          bastare.</i> </p>
      <p>Ighina shows us some ampouls full of dust and various Moon
        rocks, who knows where can ever have taken. He claims to have
        used some equipment he built, but probably here
        Extraterrestrials who know something ... Of course, those amouls
        are not safe, but there, abandoned on a table in view of
        everyone, without barriers, networks or anti-theft devices.
        Nobody [ sognerebbe of rubarle ] because no one seriously
        believes that it is really lunar material because they say that
        Ighina is "crazy". So, in my opinion, if Ighina is a "Crazy" is
        a "crazy" that speaks and acts as a wise and so should be
        enough. </p>
      <p><i>Finalmente alle 18,30 circa lo “stroboscopio magnetico”
          entra in funzione definitivamente: due pale simili a quelle di
          un elicottero cominciano a girare lentamente. Numerose lampade
          applicate alle due pale girevoli diffondono la loro luce
          accecante, intermittente e ritmica. Quelle luci diventano
          sempre più accecanti, man mano che cala la sera.</i> </p>
      <p>Finally at around 18.30 "magnetic stroboscope" begins operation
        definitively: two blades similar to those of a helicopter began
        to turn slowly. Many lamps applied two rotating blades to spread
        their blinding light, intermittent and rhythm. Those lights
        become increasingly accented as evening falls. </p>
      <p><i>Come si è detto occorrono almeno tre ore per ottenere la
          carica elettromagnetica sufficiente a formare la spirale
          d’energia magnetico-luminosa sufficiente a forare il campo
          magnetico terrestre artificiale per aprire un varco alla
          “cellula magnetica spaziale cosmica” (disco volante). Insomma,
          doveva trattarsi di una specie di “trapano magnetico” e la sua
          energia doveva accumularsi nella punta e poi esplodere come un
          sole di mezzogiorno nella notte. Poi il disco sarebbe sceso.
          Ma occorrevano ancora tre lunghe interminabili ore. Intanto
          assistiamo a fenomeni strani. Nella cortina di nubi che prima
          si erano accumulate nel cielo, si apre uno spiraglio a forma
          circolare proprio a perpendico1o sullo “stroboscopio
          magnetico” in attività. In poco tempo tutte le nuvole si
          allontanano, allargano sempre di più questo “buco” nel cielo
          sopra di noi e poi spariscono definitivamente dietro
          l'orizzonte. Alcuni stormi di rondini, come impazzite,
          cominciano a volare in tondo, vorticosamente, sopra lo
          “stroboscopio magnetico”, poi, dopo acuti garriti fuggono
          senza più farsi vedere. Intanto cala la sera.</i> </p>
      <p>As we have said it takes at least three hours to get the
        electromagnetic field sufficient to form the spiral magnetic
        energy bright enough to pierce the earth's magnetic field
        artificial to open a gate to the "magnetic cosmic space cell"
        (flying saucer). In short, was to be a kind of "magnetic drill"
        and his energy was to accumulate in tip and then explode like a
        midday sun in the night. Then the disc would be dropped. But
        still needed three long interminable hours. Meanwhile seeing
        strange phenomena. In curtain of clouds that first had
        accumulated in the sky, opens a window shaped circular
        perpendicular&nbsp; precisely on the "magnetic stroboscope"
        activities. In a short time all the clouds depart, extend their
        increasingly this "hole" in the sky above us and then disappear
        definitely behind the horizon. Some flocks of swallows, as [
        impazzite ], begin to fly in round, [ vorticosamente ], above
        the "magnetic stroboscope", then, after fleeing without acute [
        garriti ] longer be seen. Meanwhile night falls. </p>
      <p><i>Tra gli astanti c'è molta agitazione: non mancano i
          giornalisti avidi di qualche improvviso accadimento, ma la
          macchina continua febbrile se pur monotona il suo lavoro. Si
          sente dire che non manca molto al finale e che tutto procede
          bene. La luce accecante dello “stroboscopio magnetico” con la
          sua intermittenza a frequenza abbastanza elevata, provoca uno
          strano effetto ottico. Ogni cosa in movimento sembra procedere
          a scatti e se camminiamo sembra che il terreno ci traballi
          sotto i piedi. L'attesa è paziente, ma snervante. Anche se il
          freddo umido pizzica la pelle sotto i vestiti un po’ troppo
          estivi, ci si fa reciprocamente coraggio. Il freddo arriva a
          sopraffare anche gli espedienti improvvisati. I pigiami
          infilati sotto il vestito proteggono per quello che possono. I
          vestiti di panno fanno più caldo, ma si inzuppano per
          l'umidità. I giubbotti di incerata non fanno passare
          l’umidità, ma ti lasciano in un freddo cane. Abbastanza caldi,
          ma poco pratici, i plaid da pic-nic usati come mantelli. Si
          deve ammettere che la situazione è così interessante da essere
          una notevole esperienza, malgrado tutto. Nell’erba umida e
          nella terra morbida dei campi, i pezzi di polistirolo espanso
          vengono posti sotto i piedi come un'intercapedine isolante e
          alcuni giornali avvolti alle gambe danno un po’ di sollievo.
          Lo “stroboscopio magnetico” continua a funzionare. L’attesa si
          fa davvero snervante e la speranza è al culmine. Sono già le
          22.20. Ighina avverte che è necessaria un’altra ora di
          attività. Arrivano le 23.30. Molti non hanno resistito al
          freddo e si sono rifugiati all’interno del laboratorio, mentre
          altri si sono infilati nelle proprie auto. In molti la
          speranza comincia a cedere, ma moltissimi restano fuori a
          scrutare il cielo. Anch’io, col mio gruppo di amici, resto
          fuori. Stiamo lì, attenti, con macchine fotografiche e
          cineprese puntate, pronte all’uso. Saremo gli ultimi ad
          andarcene. Mentre continuiamo a tenere gli occhi fissi sullo
          “stroboscopio magnetico” che pulsa febbrilmente la sua luce ed
          il suo flusso magnetico, alcune persone arrivano eccitate da
          non molto lontano nei campi, dove la luce del dispositivo non
          rendeva difficoltosa l’osservazione del firmamento. Dicono di
          aver notato nel cielo un puntino luminoso di colore bianco
          stellare un po’ più grande di una comune stella che, durante
          la sua traiettoria, aveva rallentato la velocità diventando
          rosso per poi sparire. Dopo alcuni minuti ne avevano visto un
          altro (forse lo stesso poi ricomparso) che aveva percorso una
          traiettoria ad “esse” senza però cambiare velocità e colore.
          Un altro gruppo di persone, da un altro punto del campo,
          gridano puntando il dito verso il cielo un po’ in basso verso
          l’orizzonte: un disco luminoso compie nel cielo un brevissimo
          arco di parabola e subito scompare. La sua dimensione poteva
          essere paragonabile a quella della Luna. Intanto lo
          “stroboscopio magnetico” continua a ruotare febbrilmente e a
          pulsare il suo ritmo magnetico. Il tempo passa. Ighina e i
          suoi collaboratori cominciano a disperare riguardo la riuscita
          piena dell’esperimento e quindi circa l’atterraggio del “disco
          volante”. Gli operatori sostengono che se la condizione non è
          ottimale il “disco volante” non scende. Dicono che il congegno
          in funzione non ce la fa a perforare. Poi Ighina si accorge
          che qualcosa non va nel funzionamento del dispositivo.
          Infatti, la spirale conica di energia (così lui ci spiega)
          invece di condensare il suo potenziale sulla punta, la
          disperdeva qua le là in piccole punte secondarie disseminate
          sulle spire. Così il difetto è presto scoperto: le pale
          girevoli non sono perfettamente in asse, la loro inclinazione
          non è quella giusta e il cono d’energia ne fuoriesce
          irregolare. A molti è parso di “vederle” queste spire di
          energia avvitarsi nell’aria, ma così ad occhio nudo potevano
          sorgere molti dubbi. Io posso dire di esserne certo, avendo
          osservato lo “stroboscopio magnetico” attraverso le lenti di
          occhiali da sole polaroid: mi era anche sembrato di vedere
          come degli scoppiettii di luce lungo dette spire. Molti
          asserivano che poteva trattarsi di un’illusione ottica.
          Allora, però non si può spiegare perché alcuni le vedevano
          queste “illusioni” e altri no. E questo anche tra i bambini
          che notoriamente sono la voce della verità.</i> </p>
      <p>Among the bystanders there much agitation: there are some
        greedy journalists sudden appearing, but the machine continues [
        febrile ] though monotonous his work. He feels that not missing
        much to the final and that everything is going well. The
        blinding light of the "Magnetic Stroboscope" with his
        intermittently frequency fairly high, causing a strange optic
        effect. Everything seems to be moving forward in increments, and
        if we walk seems that the we [ traballi ] ground under your
        feet. The wait is patient, but [ snervante ].... We must admit
        that the situation is so interesting to be a great experience,
        despite everything. Nell'erba moist and soft earth of the
        fields, pieces of polystyrene foam are placed under your feet as
        un'intercapedine insulation and some newspapers wrapped legs
        give a little 'relief. The "Stroboscopio magnetic" continues to
        operate. The wait is really snervante and the hope is at the
        height. They are already 22.20. Ighina warns that we need
        another hour of activity. Arrive 23.30. Many have not survived
        the cold and they have taken refuge inside the laboratory, while
        others have put in their car. In many hope begins to divest, but
        many remain outside to study the sky. I too, with my group of
        friends, rest outside. We are there, attentive, with cameras and
        cameras bets, ready for use. We will be the last to andarcene.
        While we continue to keep our eyes fixed on the "magnetic
        stroboscopio" that pulsates febbrilmente its light and its
        magnetic flux, some people get excited by not far in fields,
        where light of the device made it difficult observation
        firmament. They say he had noticed a bullet in the sky bright
        white stars a little 'bigger than a common star that during his
        trajectory, had slowed the speed becoming red for then
        disappear. After a few minutes I saw another (perhaps the same
        then ricomparso) had travelled a trajectory to "them" without
        changing speed and color. Another group of people, from another
        point of the field, shout pointing the finger towards the sky a
        little 'down towards the horizon: a disc bright in the sky turns
        a very short period of parable and immediately disappears. Its
        size could be comparable to that of the Moon. Meanwhile the
        "Stroboscopio magnetic" continues to rotate febbrilmente and
        beat his rhythm magnet. The Time passes. Ighina and his team are
        beginning to despair about the success full the experiment and
        then about the landing of "flying saucer". Operators argue that
        if the condition is not optimal "flying saucer" does not
        descend. They say that the device in operation none makes it to
        pierce. Then Ighina realizes that something wrong with the
        functioning of device. In fact, the conical spiral of energy (so
        he says) instead of his condense potential on the tip,
        disperdeva here to there in small scattered secondary tips on
        spire. Thus the defect is soon discovered: the revolving blades
        are not perfectly in line, their inclination is not the right
        one and the cone of energy it out irregular. Many gather "See"
        these energy avvitarsi spire in the air, but so to the naked eye
        could arise many doubts. I can say to be sure, having noted the
        "magnetic stroboscopio" through the lenses of sunglasses
        polaroid I was also seemed to see how the scoppiettii of light
        along the spire. Many asserted that it could be an illusion
        optics. So, though we can not explain why some you saw these
        "illusions" and others do not. And this even among children who
        are known to the voice of truth. </p>
      <p><i>Ormai siamo rimasti solo noi nel campo, lì, davanti allo
          “stroboscopio magnetico”. A questo punto ci sembra inutile
          continuare l’osservazione del cielo. Sono rimasto io, da solo,
          a guardare lo “stroboscopio magnetico” da vicino, fintanto che
          le sue luci non si sono spente e le sue pale hanno smesso
          completamente di ruotare. Poi si spenge tutto, davvero
          definitivamente. Ormai è già l’una e mezza della notte, è già
          mercoledì e siamo giunti al 13 settembre. Ighina ci appare più
          stanco che abbattuto: ha un certa età e le notti in bianco si
          fanno sentire. Egli semplicemente si scusa dell’insuccesso
          finale del suo esperimento. Era riuscito quasi tutto bene:
          forse il “disco volante”, quel puntino che era stato osservato
          mentre vagava nel cielo, era pronto a scendere, ma, ironia
          della sorte, una banale imperfezione nel meccanismo dello
          “stroboscopio magnetico” lo ha impedito. “Pazienza!”, dicono i
          vari operatori e affermano fiduciosi che le Intelligenze del
          Cosmo si manifesteranno in una prossima occasione. A quando,
          dunque, il prossimo esperimento? Ci sono tante prospettive in
          programma, cose strabilianti, affermano gli operatori. Ma
          adesso Ighina è stanco, ha bisogno di dormire, di riposarsi,
          almeno per un mese di fila. Egli sostiene che gli
          extraterrestri lo aiuteranno ancora e che la prossima volta
          lavorerà con più calma e non fallirà. Intanto, anche in questo
          breve periodo di riposo, l’affetto e la solidarietà dei suoi
          collaboratori e amici lo accompagneranno ugualmente col
          proposito di aiutarlo e sostenerlo nel futuro per la sua
          missione di pace e di fratellanza tra gli uomini.</i> </p>
      <p>By now we were only us in the field, there, in front of the
        "magnetic stroboscopio." At this point it seems unnecessary to
        continue the observation of the sky. I was alone to watch "
        magnetic stroboscope" closely, as long as its lights were not
        turned off and its blades have completely ceased to rotate. Then
        [ spenge ] all really definitively. It is already one and a half
        of the night, is already Wednesday and we came to September 13.
        Ighina appears to us more tired that shot down: it has a certain
        age and white nights are felt. He simply excuse the failure of
        his final experiment. He was succeeded almost everything well:
        perhaps the UFO which was observed while [ vagava ] in the sky,
        was ready to fall, but, ironically, a trivial imperfection in
        the mechanism of the "magnetic stroboscope" has prevented.
        "Patience!", Say the various operators and say confidently that
        the intelligence of Cosmo will occur at a future occasion. When,
        then, the next experiment? There are many perspectives on
        schedule, amazing things, say traders. But now Ighina is tired,
        needs to sleep, relax, at least for one month in a row. He
        argues that the extra help and that the next time will work with
        more calm and not fail. Meanwhile, even in this short period of
        rest, the affection and solidarity of its collaborators and
        friends accompany the equally with regard to help and support in
        future for his mission of peace and brotherhood among men. </p>

      <p><i>Domanda: “Che bisogno hanno gli Extraterrestri di ricorrere
          ad Ighina? Non sono più progrediti di noi? Allora non possono
          fare da soli?”</i> </p>
      <p><i>Risposta: “Evidentemente gli Extraterrestri non ritengono
          opportuno fare da soli. Infatti essi si servono di operatori e
          di programmati terrestri, i quali agiscono per loro diretto
          consiglio e ammaestramento. Ighina è un programmato. Ma anche
          gli operatori ed i programmati possono fallire. Infatti, gli
          errori umani sono imprevisti previsti. Tutti quegli errori che
          si verificano a causa degli operatori e dei programmati sono
          dovuti al fatto che gli uomini sono sempre uomini e non
          extraterrestri. Solo in caso di estrema necessità e per il
          minimo indispensabile le Intelligenze Cosmiche intervengono e
          agiscono direttamente. Il nostro ambiente, specie ai bassi
          livelli di altitudine, non loro molto favorevole. Inoltre essi
          sono qui per aiutarci, ma non perché gli uomini restino

      <p><b>RESPONSE OF STAFF OF IGHINA</b> </p>
      <p><b>OBJECTION TO UN'OVVIA BY SOME OF DEFENDANTS</b> </p>
      <p>Question: "What need have the Extraterrestri to use Ighina?
        There are more advanced us? So can not go it alone? " </p>
      <p>Answer: "Obviously the Extraterrestri not consider it
        appropriate to do alone. In fact they serve operators and
        planned land, which acting on their advice and direct
        ammaestramento. Ighina is a programmed. But operators and
        planned may fail. Indeed, human errors are unforeseen schedule.
        All those errors that occur because of operators and planned are
        due to the fact that men are always men and not
        extraterrestrials. Only in cases of extreme necessity and for
        the minimum necessary Intelligences Cosmiche speak and act
        directly. Our environment, especially at low levels altitude,
        not very favourable. Furthermore, they are here to help us, but
        not because men remain passive, but because reaches alone with

      <p><i>2 Secondo quanto affermato dallo stesso Pier Luigi Ighina e
          dai suoi collaboratori, un prossimo esperimento, piuttosto
          clamoroso, dovrebbe essere quello di bloccare per ventiquattro
          ore (in data imprecisata) tutte le apparecchiature elettriche
          d’Italia al fine di risvegliare le coscienze degli uomini e
          spingerli ad operare per il bene, rispettando la natura ed
          evitando così l’autodistruzione.</i> </p>
      <p><i>3 A questo proposito è bene ricordare quanto accadde al

      <p>2 According to the same Pier Luigi Ighina and its
        collaborators, the near experiment, rather striking, it should
        be to block for twenty-four hours ( imprecisata date) all

        lead them to work for the good, respecting nature and thus
        avoiding self-destruction. </p>
      <p>3 It is good to remember what happened to the pilot American

      <p>For Luigi Ighina, unknown prophet, but above all misunderstood.
      </p>
      <p>A few months after the death on 8 January 2004, this book is
        published by a group of friends and collaboratorswho wanted real
        good and recognized him as a prophet and a great master. It is
        an extreme attempt to make the world a message that Ighina
        endeavoured in all modes of spread throughout the arc of his
        long life (he was born in Milan on June 23 1908), receiving in
        return only misunderstanding and derision . </p>
      <p>We are in this book the truth of those revelations that he led
        on earth, which are mainly scientific while still covering all
        aspects of human life, which if they finally understood, will
        completely revolutionize today's mentality allowing men to stop
        the mad rush that is leading towards the abyss. </p>
      <p>The text itself is short, is more than anything else in the
        transcription of certain conferences held recently that reveal
        lesser-known aspects of his teaching and his personality and
        especially that contain the key to deciphering the true nature
        of his messages that are not always were easy to understand. </p>
      <p>There were also some additions to his meditations inspired
        Revelations to try to make more complete the overall picture. </p>
      <p>The rest of the book reproduces some of the alerts, warnings,
        information that had Ighina print in the last forty years, as
        well as some articles of journalists who had interviewed. </p>
      <p>If this book, which is printed anonymously, generates enough
        interest, will be followed by another more detailed publication.
