      "In 30 years of practicing dentistry, I've learned that there are
      some amazing factors about getting cavities and having gum
      problems that the PUBLIC DOES NOT KNOW.<br>
      <br>
      Suffering cavities and/or gum problems is a communicable
      disease... you catch it from someone else by kissing, using
      contaminated eating or drinking utensils, etc.<br>
      <br>
      It is as easy to cure it as it is to catch it ...it's really
      simple, you just need to know what's happening and what to do
      about it.<br>
      <br>
      The REAL PROBLEM was first identified and related to the public in
      a book published in Philadelphia in 1819... bacterial colonies
      being allowed to grow out of hand, at the neck of the tooth.&nbsp;
      It's like ring around the collar... or "neck of the tooth
      disease".<br>
      <br>
      When people "get with it" by daily eliminating the cause... the
      body heals itself.&nbsp; The body regrows new healthy gums,
      calcium and phosphorus are deposited in areas of soft enamel and
      dentin, thus healing cavities. This is not so amazing to the many
      folks who already know, that given the chance... the body heals
      itself. This includes all tissues. Cavities can be made to heal,
      new bone will grow around the necks of loose teeth, and brand new
      gums will grow to replace diseased and receeded gums.<br>
      <br>
      "Someday, hopefully soon, the dental profession will become
      extinct... it will happen as soon as the public learns about the
      cause and cure of cavities and gum problems. No one I've ever
      known in over 30 years has not wanted to solve their own
      problems... once they know how."<br>
      <br>
      Sincerely,&nbsp; Robert O. Nara, D.D.S. <br>

      <b>Hyaluronic Acid</b> - Helpful in preventing or restoring gum
      recession.&nbsp; Here is the Best...<br>
      <br>
      Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (HA) exists naturally in all
      living organisms. In the body, it is found in greater
      concentrations in the synovial fluid of the connective tissue of
      teeth &amp; gums,&nbsp; joints for lubrication, the vitreous humor
      (fluid) of the eye and most abundantly in the skin.<br>
      <br>
      As we age, the body produces less and less hyaluronic acid. This
      has an adverse effect on normal, smooth, comfortable joint
      movement and normal softness and smoothness of the skin. You can
      maintain normal mobility, proper skin condition, the skin's
      self-smoothing ability when wounded, and clear healthy eyes with
      Synthovial Seven®.<br>
      <br>
      Synthovial Seven® is an oral solution made from premium grade
      hyaluronic acid with a molecular weight between 2.4 -- 3.0 million
      Daltons. Hyaluronic acid is a polymer and it can come in varying
      molecular weights. Studies have shown more benefits with the
      higher molecular weight HA polymers.<br>
      <br>
      A new study examines the three types of nutritional supplements
      labeled as HA available to consumers. Read this detailed,
      scientific study to find out why high molecular weight HA is the
      only one that the body can actually recognize and use as HA.&nbsp;
      It Works Fast!&nbsp;&nbsp; Synthovial Seven® is a liquid solution
      of hyaluronic acid. Oral solutions by nature are absorbed by the
      body easier and quicker than tablets and capsules.&nbsp; It's Easy
      to Take!&nbsp;&nbsp; A full dropper, one (1) ml.once a day is all
      it takes. It's Safe!<br>
      <br>
      Synthovial Seven® is hyaluronic acid that comes from an
      extracellular substance produced by a bacteria. There are no
      animal derivatives. Since HA is native to the human body and our
      product is not derived from animal tissue, hypersensitivity is not
      a concern. There are no known side effects.<br>

          <br>
          In 1819 a dentist named Levi S. Parmly wrote a book called <br>
          <br>
          A Practical Guide to the Management of the Teeth . . .
          Comprising a Discovery of the Origin of Caries, or Decay of
          the Teeth, with its Prevention and Cure.<br>
          <br>
          <br>
          Dr. G. V. BlackSome 77 years later, Dr. G. V. Black closed his
          address to a group of dental school graduates with these
          words:<br>
          <br>
          "The day is coming, and perhaps within the lifetime of you
          young men, when we will be engaged in practicing preventive
          rather than reparative dentistry.''<br>
          <br>
          Yet the U.S. Public Health Service tells us that 98 out of
          every 100 men, women, and children in the United States still
          suffer from some form of dental disease. And American Dental
          Association figures indicate that the average American has 14
          teeth decayed, filled, or missing by the time he or she
          reaches 20 years of age! Just what has happened to the dream
          of preventive dentistry?<br>
          <br>
          "It isn't a dream anymore, it's a reality!" says Dr. Robert
          Nara of Houghton, Michigan, who adds, "Dental disease-tooth
          decay and bad gums -- can be eliminated . . . I've been doing
          it for almost 20 years.' "<br>
          <br>
          These are pretty strong words ... especially to those of us
          who are suffering from the pain and financial losses caused by
          conventional reparative dentistry. But Bob Nara is sure of his
          message . . . S0 sure, in fact, that he has put his means of
          earning a living on the line in a bitter struggle with the
          dental establishment (those professional organizations which,
          Nara claims, condition this country's dentists to do no more
          than "help the patient's mouth rest comfortably while the
          teeth die").<br>
          <br>
          MOTHER was curious about Nara 's claims and about the system
          of preventive cure, called Oramedics, that the Michigan
          dentist has designed to help "spread the word " that dental
          disease can be eradicated.<br>
          <br>
          And so staffer Bruce Woods flew up to the Wolverine state for
          a talk with Nara, who had -- not long before -- had his
          license suspended by the Michigan State Dental Association.
          This transcript of their conversation contains some statements
          that - if true -- paint a shocking picture of a "medical"
          profession that has the means to insure dental health but,
          instead, allows political and economic pressures to limit its
          practice to treating symptoms . . . while it completely
          ignores the causes of tooth and gum disease.<br>
          <br>
          Whether you finish this interview as a believer in Oramedics
          or not, we think you owe it to your mouth to read what Bob
          Nara has to say.<br>
          <br>
          PLOWBOY: Dr. Nara, your ideas about preventive dentistry have,
          so far, cost you your license to practice, gotten you kicked
          out of the county, state, and national dental organizations,
          and forced you to face criminal charges. I know this situation
          didn't develop overnight, so why don't we begin at the
          beginning. Can you tell me about your training and
          professional background?<br>
          <br>
          NARA: Of course. I took my undergraduate degree at Michigan
          State University--in East Lansing, Michigan--in 1955.
          Immediately thereafter, I enrolled in the University of
          Michigan's dental school. After graduation. I served in the
          Navy for two years ... during which time I practiced dentistry
          at the Pacific missile range headquarters in California. I
          returned to Houghton, Michigan when my hitch was up and set
          myself up in private practice in 1961.<br>
          <br>
          PLOWBOY: How did it happen that your work turned toward
          preventive, rather than reparative dentistry?<br>
          <br>
          NARA: Well, first of all, I was taught enough microbiology,
          oral physiology, and biochemistry in dental school to get a
          pretty fair understanding of the processes that contribute to
          dental disease. This "medical" material, however, was
          presented to us in a rather hit-or-miss pattern .. . with bits
          of information dribbling in during one class or another. What
          my schooling really prepared me for, however--and what any
          student in dental school is actually trained to do-was
          mechanics . . . drilling and filling.<br>
          <br>
          PLOWBOY: Don't the dental schools encourage preventive care?<br>
          <br>
          NARA: No, they don't encourage it at all! And there's another
          factor that contributes to the lack of preventive dentistry in
          the United States, too. You see, most young dentists--upon
          graduation-have a very substantial educational debt to take
          care of. Then, in order to get a practice started, these men
          and women have to go out and buy more than $50,000 worth of
          equipment! So there is, as you can see, tremendous pressure
          put upon the beginning dentist to get going and bring in some
          money. I believe that many of these people would like to be
          able to start their practices by teaching folks how to clean
          their mouths, but the simple truth is that the big money is in
          reparative work. So, the new dentist--who, as I've said, is
          really under the economic gun--puts off his or her ideas about
          prevention until after the bills are paid . . . and once that
          pattern is established, it never really gets broken.<br>
          <br>
          PLOWBOY: Can you be more specific about that "pattern"?<br>
          <br>
          NARA: Certainly. You see, after a beginning practitioner has
          become convinced that mechanical repair is the only way to get
          out of debt, he or she will usually spend a long period of
          time doing little else. Now, reparative dentistry is, for the
          most part, dull, tedious, and--in all but a financial
          sense--unrewarding work. It doesn't take much of this sort of
          drudgery to kill off any idealism that might have motivated
          the dentist to try prevention in the first place.<br>
          <br>
          It seems that many of these doctors eventually come to regard
          dental health from the same frame of reference as most of the
          American public does ... that dental disease is inevitable and
          that everyone will lose his or her teeth sooner or later.
          Naturally, once this attitude takes over--and it may be a "gut
          feeling'' that's never actually spoken about or even
          consciously thought--the dentist begins to feel that
          prevention is a waste of time . . . and so the status quo
          perpetuates itself.<br>
          <br>
          PLOWBOY: But this common attitude didn't keep you from
          practicing preventive therapy?<br>
          <br>
          NARA: No, it didn't, and I think there are several reasons why
          I was able to maintain my interest in prevention. For one
          thing, I'm a pretty stubborn individual. For another. I
          dislike even trying to treat a mouth that isn't clean. I mean,
          why go through the time and effort necessary to really remove
          decay and place nice fillings when you know--because the mouth
          itself is not being cared for--that the new work is going to
          be decayed all around its margins in six months or a year?
          There's simply not much job satisfaction in enlarging the same
          filling time after time until the tooth has to come out.<br>
          <br>
          So, early in my practice I tried to put together a plan that
          would motivate my patients, to help them establish an
          effective oral hygiene program. I failed miserably--as I
          should have known I would--because nobody wanted to listen.<br>
          <br>
          My patients, at that time, shared the common attitude: "Come
          on, Doc, just get that tooth filled, or get this one pulled.
          and let me out of here." Because most folks don't want to
          spend any more time than is absolutely necessary in a
          dentist's office, they want to get away from that chair and
          away from those drills as quickly as possible.<br>
          <br>
          PLOWBOY: This "fear" would seem to be related to the frame of
          reference you spoke of earlier.<br>
          <br>
          NARA: Right, it's part of the same attitude. And, because of
          that frame of reference, a dentist can talk till he or she's
          blue in the face about keeping the mouth healthy and so forth.
          Nobody wants to hear about it . . . nobody even believes it !<br>
          <br>
          PLOWBOY: Do people actually doubt that prevention can be
          effective, or do they simply feel that they lack the willpower
          to follow through with such a program?<br>
          <br>
          NARA: I think that--in most cases--a combination of both these
          beliefs is at work . . . because the concept of a really
          effective oral health program is simply beyond the scope of
          most people's experience. For example, note the toothpaste ads
          that are run on television: "Look. Mom, only one cavity ! "
          Now, that ad is claiming--and the manufacturers of that
          product are claiming--that really good prevention will result
          in only one cavity every six months! At that rate, a person
          could have more than 32 fillings by the time he or she reaches
          21 years of age! It's crazy, and this kind of advertising
          contributes to our national indifference toward the prevention
          of dental disease. <br>
          Another problem with the traditional approach to oral hygiene
          is that it's all "teach, teach, teach". Now adults,
          especially--and even children to a large degree--don't really
          appreciate being told that someone is going to teach them
          something. Most folks consider the very suggestion that they
          need education to be an insult, a put-down. Yet, many "modern"
          dental offices have a room with a big sign on the door that
          says. "Patient Education Room". The sign might as well say.
          "This Way, Dummy", because that's exactly the feeling that's
          conveyed.<br>
          <br>
          PLOWBOY: How did you manage to communicate the necessary
          information without insulting your patients, then?<br>
          <br>
          NARA: Well, I knew that most people avoid the dentist's office
          until they need work done . . . usually either a filling or an
          extraction. And people in pain aren't likely to be receptive
          to a cute story about preventing the disease. So, I had to
          design a system that would penetrate, first, the preoccupation
          with money worries and physical discomfort that most folks
          bring to the office with them. And I also had to figure out a
          way to change the preconception that nothing can be done about
          tooth decay and gum disease anyway.<br>
          <br>
          With all of these cards stacked against me. I knew that I
          needed a very effective psychological delivery system. So, I
          spent a lot of time thinking about it, saying to myself. "How
          can I do this?"<br>
          My goal was to stop disease, and I was sure that I could stop
          it--I had all of the scientific evidence in the world to back
          me up--if I could get the patients' help and cooperation.<br>
          <br>
          And that's what the "method" that I came to call Oramedics
          does: It enables me to get the patients to cooperate, to take
          the control of their own oral environment into their own
          hands. And the system works!<br>
          <br>
          PLOWBOY: But as soon as you started practicing this form of
          prevention, you began to encounter resistance from the dental
          establishment. When did the first signs of your coming "war"
          with organized dentistry show up?<br>
          <br>
          NARA: I began working, in 1968, to bring about some changes in
          the outmoded dental laws that still exist in much of the U.S.
          At that point I was mainly concerned with setting up a system
          that would help the dentist to be more effective in his or her
          job. Part of the problem, as I saw it, was that most dentists
          simply didn't have the time to handle health education
          effectively. I felt that this situation could be remedied if
          the doctors were able to delegate some of the more routine
          dental tasks to paradental personnel. After all, there are
          many new types of paramedical jobs and paralegal jobs today,
          but we really don't have any new paradental positions . . .
          there haven't been any "new kids on the team" for years.<br>
          <br>
          So, I started lecturing that dental assistants should be
          trained to polish teeth, to give fluoride treatments, and so
          forth... in order to allow these people to become really
          worthwhile members of the dental health team. I pushed pretty
          hard to get new laws passed that would help bring about these
          changes. For instance. I got myself elected to the American
          Dental Association's House of Delegates in 1971 and spent four
          years pushing for modern laws.<br>
          <br>
          Unfortunately, dental laws fall under the category of state's
          rights, so--even though the House of Delegates did vote to
          recommend liberalized legislation--direct action could only be
          taken at the state level. And it just so happens that my home
          state of Michigan is one of the most backward places--in terms
          of dental progress--in the Union. This is because we have a
          network of long-entrenched "dental politicians" in Michigan.
          In many states, on the other hand, there is a regular turnover
          among professional politicians, because many people compete
          for these positions. Michigan, however, lacks that healthy
          competition, and old dental ideas are seldom challenged here.
          In fact, just as an example, we had two men-- father and
          son-who ran the Michigan State Board of Dentistry for 40 years
          !<br>
          <br>
          Anyway, I went to work, through the appropriate political
          channels, and helped to get rid of some of these people who
          were--I thought--standing in the way of necessary change. And,
          in the process of fighting the entrenched hierarchy. I did
          make some enemies . . . enemies who are still "haunting" me
          today.<br>
          <br>
          The first real sign of the troubles to come, however, showed
          up in April of 1968. I was called, at that time, before the
          State Board of Dentistry and told--by one of the Board's
          members-that I'd lose my license if I continued to rock the
          boat. I replied that I believed myself to be in the right,
          that I was acting in the public interest, and that I would
          continue to do so regardless of whatever he was tempted to do
          in retaliation. The board member responded by saying. "We'll
          get you." And it took him 10 years, 10 long years of battles
          in the professional organizations and in the courts, to
          finally take my license away from me.<br>
          <br>
          The State Board chose to attack me on the ground that I was
          training my assistants to perform the routine tasks I
          described above. They tried to force me to stop doing this,
          and I, of course, refused. Then, in 1972, one of my
          assistants--while following my instructions--placed a
          medicated piece of cotton in a patient's cavity . . . and the
          man returned the next day with warrants for my assistant's and
          my arrest. He was actually the attorney who served as chief
          investigator for the Dental Board's Department of Licensing
          and Regulations!<br>
          <br>
          PLOWBOY: And what was the outcome of that 1972 arrest?<br>
          <br>
          NARA: Well, it eventually led to an arraignment. And, at the
          hearing, the judge explained to me that--if I were found
          guilty as charged--I could spend a year in jail and be fined
          up to $500. <br>
          He then asked me how I intended to plead, and I told him
          "guilty".<br>
          <br>
          The judge was upset by this. "You're putting me in a rough
          spot here. Doctor," he said. I asked him what he meant, and he
          explained that--if I didn't plead''not guilty''--he'd have to
          sentence me. I replied that I was at fault, that I had allowed
          my assistants to polish teeth and so forth. So, the judge
          turned off his tape recorder, leaned over the bench, and
          advised me to get myself a lawyer and to give the matter some
          serious thought before I came to trial. Well, I didn't hire an
          attorney. I didn't want one, because my attitude was that the
          laws themselves were wrong ... and I figured that I might just
          as well be the person who challenged them.<br>
          <br>
          At any rate, it took another six months for the case to
          actually come to trial, and the State Dental Board must have
          gotten a bit worried by that time. It looked pretty certain
          that the judge was going to have to throw me in the slammer
          for a year, and the Board must have decided that they'd get a
          lot of bad press if they sent a dentist to jail for letting
          his assistants perform routine tasks, so they dropped the
          charges.<br>
          <br>
          PLOWBOY: Was that the end of your troubles?<br>
          <br>
          NARA: Everything did settle down for a while. I was, at the
          time, writing research proposals for Michigan Technological
          University. And, about a year after the trial, I came up with
          a really unique proposal that seemed to have a very good
          chance of being accepted. While I was out of town lecturing,
          however, the president of the Copper County District Dental
          Society went to the dean of the university's School of
          Business--who was in charge of the grant proposal program--and
          told him that the college should take my name off the proposal
          and put the Dental Society president's name on it! The
          president threatened that--if this wasn't done--the Society's
          members would write letters to the Department of Health,
          Education. and Welfare saying that they did not want this
          research done in their area. Of course, HEW isn't likely to
          try to conduct research in any given area if the local doctors
          oppose that study . . . because the project would become a
          terrible mess.<br>
          <br>
          PLOWBOY: Are you referring to the peer pressure that could be
          put on the researchers?<br>
          <br>
          NARA: Correct. Anyway, the dean was upset--he didn't want to
          lose the grant that might mean several million dollars to his
          university--and, as he was unable to reach me, he gave in. My
          name was taken off the proposal and the name of the president
          of the County District Dental Society was put on.<br>
          <br>
          I was, of course, very angry when I heard about this, because
          the proposal was my work! So--since I had no other course of
          action available--I filed a complaint with the Dental Society
          against its own president! In retaliation, the Society simply
          disbanded and then reorganized itself . . . thereby clearing
          the records of all former complaints!<br>
          <br>
          But, although those local dental politicians had effectively
          swept my charges under the table, they were really riled that
          I'd had the gall to attack them. Soon after they had
          reorganized their little club, Society dentists sent a series
          of letters to the Department of Licensing and Regulation.
          These documents charged me with unethical conduct on the
          grounds that I was still training my dental assistants to
          polish teeth and perform other such routine chores.<br>
          <br>
          Ironically, while I was being hassled for training my
          assistants to polish teeth, the major dental journals were
          carrying ads for a portable device that would allow patients
          to polish their own teeth at home!<br>
          <br>
          And, to make the situation even more ludicrous. I was then-and
          still am--qualified to teach in any dental school in the
          country. I don't need a single additional credit to train
          young people to become dentists . .. and yet my profession
          attacked me for teaching dental assistants to polish teeth!<br>
          <br>
          PLOWBOY: The charge is almost identical to that made in 1972 .
          . how were the members of the Dental Society able to make it
          stick in this case?<br>
          <br>
          NARA: In 1972 they had tried to "get" me in the civil courts
          and had let those charges drop for fear of bad publicity. In
          this instance, however, they decided to handle the matter
          themselves and stay out of the courts. So I was charged,
          before the Michigan State Board of Dentistry, with letting an
          unlicensed assistant polish teeth and with ''advertising an
          unrecognized specialty". The latter accusation refers to an ad
          that I had placed in the local yellow pages. The advertisement
          read: "Specializing in Oramedics ... for people with teeth who
          want to keep them."&nbsp; You should know, too, that it is not
          illegal for a dentist to advertise in Michigan. For instance,
          dentists have run ads saying that they specialized in
          dentures, or root canals, or something like that, and they
          have had no problems. Oramedics, however, is not a term that
          the American Dental Associstion or the Michigan State Dental
          Association recognizes. And, on the basis of those two
          charges, they were ultimately able to suspend my license for
          15 months.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even more ludicrous ... I don 't need a
          single additional (college) credit to train young people to
          become dentists . . . and yet my profession attacked me for
          teaching dental assistants to polish teeth!<br>
          <br>
          PLOWBOY: When did this suspension take effect?<br>
          <br>
          NARA: On February 15. 1978.<br>
          <br>
          PLOWBOY: Did you then make any effort to appeal the Board's
          action?<br>
          <br>
          <br>
          NARA: Yes, I did. As a first step, I filed an appeal, based on
          what I felt was the unconstitutionality of Michigan's dental
          codes . . . and charging, also, that the board was guilty of
          misconduct because of the manner in which the proceedings were
          held and the findings reached.<br>
          <br>
          You see, the Board had, as usual, hired a hearing examiner-in
          this instance he was an administrative judge named Wayne
          Lusk--to rule on the case. But Lusk found me innocent: He said
          that the Oramedics-related charges "failed to establish a
          violation"! The Board, however, threw Lusk's report out,
          upheld the charges against me, and then also voted never to
          use Mr. Lusk--who had 35 years' experience as a hearing
          examiner-- again!<br>
          <br>
          At any rate, I filed an appeal-- based upon the discrepancies
          in the dental codes and on this "irregularity'' --with the
          state appeals court.<br>
          <br>
          PLOWBOY: And did the appeals court give you any help?<br>
          <br>
          NARA: No, the court was also presented with a
          "counterstatement of facts'' from the State Board of
          Dentistry, and it denied my appeal for "lack of merit and
          grounds presented''.<br>
          <br>
          PLOWBOY: Have you taken any further steps to clear yourself?<br>
          <br>
          NARA: I've appealed to the Michigan State Supreme Court.
          They've had my appeal for some 10 months now and have yet to
          decide if they'll even hear the case! This delay is curious,
          as I was assured--by Mr. Bruce Lindstrom, who was then the
          aide in charge of Upper Peninsula affairs for Governor
          Milliken--that my appeal would be handled quickly and that a
          stay of my license suspension would be granted, automatically,
          while the appeal was in progress. Lindstrom told me this when
          the appeal was first filed. He has since resigned, and I've
          still gotten no word from the Supreme Court.<br>
          <br>
          PLOWBOY: It does seem as if you're being singled out for
          ''special treatment''. Do you have any theories that could
          explain this apparent vendetta?<br>
          <br>
          NARA: In my opinion the whole thing boils down to one simple
          fact: The dental establishment is scared to death that the
          public is going to realize that the entire profession has been
          making a living by repairing the results of a disease they
          could have been curing all along! I just happen to be, at the
          present time, the person who is in the best position to expose
          organized dentistry.<br>
          Nothing was resolved in my prior encounters with the county
          and state dental associations, because they dropped their
          charges and swept mine under the table. This time, however, I
          think there's going to be a winner and a loser, and my
          opponents are pulling out all the stops to keep me under
          wraps. They're soliciting a lot of support, too--by using
          loaded terms like "unethical conduct"-among those
          indoctrinated dentists who don't want anyone upsetting their
          very lucrative apple carts.<br>
          <br>
          PLOWBOY: Why do you refer to "unethical conduct" as a loaded
          term?<br>
          <br>
          NARA: I think many people would feel that the phrase has an
          almost "dirty" ring to it . . . it sounds like it has
          something to do with morality. This is not really the case,
          however, because--in medical jargon--the functional meaning of
          "ethics" is usually "not squealing on another doctor". If the
          other guy makes a mistake, you are expected--because of your
          professional ethics--not to expose him. You can imagine, then,
          why the dental establishment has come so unglued about my case
          . . . because I haven't discriminated, I haven't singled out
          any individuals, I'm exposing the whole profession's lack of
          concern about disease prevention! And, of course, if there
          weren't anything there to expose, it's unlikely that I would
          have drawn such a violent reaction.<br>
          <br>
          Strangely enough, however, the whole battle could have been
          avoided. I wouldn't have had anything to expose if the dental
          establishment had allowed me to continue to practice and
          develop my methods. It would have been easy--and mutually
          beneficial--for all of us to work together and share each
          other's ideas for the good of the patients and of the
          profession. But, when they took my license away and threw me
          out of their associations, they left me no recourse but to
          fight, and that's what I'm doing.<br>
          <br>
          PLOWBOY: And how are you striking back at the associations
          that have attacked you?<br>
          <br>
          NARA: I've filed a suit against the American Dental
          Association, the Michigan State Dental Association, and the
          Copper County District Dental Society for eight million
          dollars in damages. I didn't want to sue, and I still don't,
          but i have no other way to defend myself at this point.<br>
          <br>
          PLOWBOY: The National Health Federation Bulletin recently
          cited a 1974 study in which a group of dentists were asked
          whether they felt that they had an effective preventive
          dentistry program in their offices. If the answer was "no",
          the study requested the reasons for this lack. Some 88% of the
          dentists questioned explained the absence of such a program by
          saying that they were uncertain about the financial aspects of
          disease prevention. Do you feel that this sort of "office
          economics" is behind some of the opposition to your
          "Oramedics" approach to preventive dentistry?<br>
          <br>
          NARA: Oh, I'm sure it is! For example, did you realize that
          there's a $30-million-a-year business going on in denture
          teeth alone . . . I don't mean full dentures, just the little
          white beans that dentists stick into the plastic form that
          they call a denture. And that figure only represents one small
          item. If you multiply it by all of the filling materials,
          bridges, inlays, and so forth, you can see that there is a
          tremendous amount of financial interest in maintaining the
          disease process.<br>
          <br>
          There's another angle to this economic concern, too. When we
          all but eliminated polio we didn't put physicians out of
          business ... in fact, we couldn't ever do without M.D.'s ...
          because we seem to replace every disease that we are able to
          eliminate with another that was almost unheard of before. But
          dentistry is--for all intents and purposes--based on one
          disease. If you can eliminate that disease--and you can! --the
          job market for dentists would eventually be limited to
          cosmetic work and regular preventive checkups. The future
          simply wouldn't hold enough work for the number of dentists
          that we have today.<br>
          <br>
          I've tried to discuss this possibility in my lectures, to calm
          the fears that it creates among my cohorts. After all, those
          people that are practicing today don't have a thing to worry
          about. There's so much dental disease in this country right
          now that we could all spend the rest of our lives just trying
          to correct the existing problems! I feel, however, that we are
          morally obligated to prevent disease whenever and wherever we
          can ... and that the focal point of our efforts has to come in
          children's dentistry, where the damage can be stopped before
          it starts.<br>
          <br>
          Of course, the ADA would claim that it does concentrate on
          prevention for children . . . with things like the Children's
          Dental Health Week. But the fact is that those programs have
          been totally ineffective.<br>
          <br>
          For example, our dental establishment constantly assures us
          that we have the finest system of dental care in the world.
          Yet a study was recently done in New Zealand to determine how
          many school children--out of a random sampling of 10,000-were
          missing any permanent teeth. That study turned up 18 students
          who had already lost one or more. In a similar study made in
          the U.S., however, 6,000 out of a random group of 10,000 were
          already missing one or more permanent teeth. And the
          discrepancy shown by these two studies--the difference between
          18 children and 6,000 who have lost irreplaceable teeth-is
          attributable to the fact that New Zealand has a dental nurse
          program for its schoolchildren. Of course, we have children's
          dental programs too ... and the evidence damns them as
          worthless.<br>
          <br>
          PLOWBOY: You touched upon the subject of dentures while we
          were discussing the financial pressures that may cause
          dentists to resist preventive programs. Yet you yourself do
          not make dentures . . . can you tell me the reason that you
          don't?<br>
          <br>
          NARA: Because I'm not motivated to provide that service.
          Dentures are the end of the road, and--in my opinion--a
          dentist selling dentures is akin to a physician peddling
          coffins. It seems to me that it's almost immoral for a healer
          to spend too much time and effort cleaning up after a
          preventable illness that has run its course. Naturally,
          someone has to make these prosthetic devices, but I choose not
          to.<br>
          <br>
          PLOWBOY: Would you say that American dentistry places a heavy
          emphasis on dentures?<br>
          <br>
          NARA: Very much so. Dentures are, for one thing, about the
          most profitable service that a dentist can provide. You might
          not know this, but dental laboratories often don't charge more
          than $25 a plate to prepare a set of dentures for a dentist.
          And the finished product-$50 worth of work for both upper and
          lower plates--might cost the patient as much as seven or eight
          hundred dollars! In fact, the lab costs on most dental
          services are usually less than 20% of the fee charged to the
          patient. The profits are tremendous! I feel that, because of
          this huge profit potential, dentures should be taken out of
          the hands of the dentists!<br>
          <br>
          In fact, a dentist named Dr. W.W. Alport tried--back in 1877
          --to have denture-making removed from the curriculum in dental
          schools. Alport was ahead of his time, but I think this change
          will have to come about. After all, if our profession is
          supposed to be trying to save teeth, doesn't it constitute a
          kind of conflict of interest to have this tremendous economic
          return for selling "crutches"?<br>
          <br>
          PLOWBOY: I think many people will see it that way. But your
          Oramedics program, on the other hand, does concentrate upon
          saving teeth. Could you tell me precisely how Oramedics works,
          and what facts and figures you can cite to prove that it has
          been successful in your nearly 20 years of practice?<br>
          <br>
          NARA: First and foremost. Oramedics is a method of reaching
          the patient . . . it's a kind of consumer-protection
          dentistry. To put it another way. Oramedics is a combination
          of scientific tests and a psychological delivery system. The
          tests show the ecology of the mouth and can monitor the
          improvement or degeneration of that ecology, while the
          delivery system motivates the patient to continually improve
          the health of his or her teeth and gums. Now, it might sound
          egotistical to say that our message reaches people better than
          the traditional "patient education programs" do, but
          egotistical or not, that statement is true . . . and our
          success is based upon the logic inherent in the program, not
          on my charming personality!<br>
          <br>
          When a patient comes into my Oramedics office, he or she is
          given--as a part of the routine examination--a U.S. Navy
          plaque index test. Now, most people will be curious about this
          test, because it's unfamiliar to them. The staff then explains
          what the test is: that it was developed and is in constant use
          by the Navy, and that it is a means of measuring the amount of
          plaque--a film made up of bacteria, food particles, and saliva
          --which is adhering to the teeth. From that point. most folks
          want to know how the test relates to them and how they can
          improve their "score".<br>
          Similarly, when we ask the patient to spit into a little
          bottle, he or she will usually ask why we're doing this. The
          question is a logical one, and we answer that the saliva
          sample will be tested to let us know the amount of bacteria
          that the mouth contains. And, once the person understands the
          reasons for the tests, he or she is told that--if we all work
          together--we can eradicate most of the plaque and bacteria ...
          and thus create an oral ecology that will no longer support
          tooth decay or gum disease!<br>
          <br>
          Of course, most folks become a bit suspicious upon hearing
          this. But, we go on to explain that their suspicion is a
          product of an "old" frame of reference ... and that the frame
          of reference will have to be changed because Oramedics doesn't
          accept tooth decay or bad gums.<br>
          The two tests, then, help the dentist understand whatever
          problems are present. But, more important, they also help the
          patient see the problems. And, once you let someone understand
          his or her disease--and then convince that person that the
          disease can be simply and inexpensively cured--you can expect
          that he or she will cooperate with you to get the illness
          cleared up.<br>
          <br>
          Over a period of almost 20 years of using these methods, we
          have never failed to eliminate dental disease from the mouth
          of anyone who has cooperated with us. Of course, we have had
          some folks say, "Dr. Nara. you're some kind of a nut." and
          just get up and go out the door.<br>
          <br>
          PLOWBOY: What percentage of your patients have refused to
          follow the program and left your practice?<br>
          <br>
          NARA: We've kept careful records on that. Over the years we've
          lost between three and five percent of our patients because
          they weren't willing to try--or stick with-- the program.<br>
          <br>
          PLOWBOY: That leaves you with quite an impressive "success
          ratio''.<br>
          <br>
          NARA: And the people who do stay to listen get our message,
          and once they get the message, it stands to reason that
          they'll follow through. I mean, who really wants to have bad
          teeth? Then, of course, once the results begin to show
          up--which is usually in a matter of weeks--these patients feel
          very proud of themselves, and rightly so ... because Oramedics
          is self-help dentistry. The dentist's office becomes a place
          where the patient can check the progress that he or she is
          making toward having a completely disease-free mouth!<br>
          <br>
          You could say that Oramedics is to dental health as Dr.
          Kenneth H. Cooper's "aerobics" is to physical fitness. When
          Cooper wanted to bring his running program to the people he
          said, in effect, "Look, you clowns, your blood vessels are
          going to hell, you need to get some oxygen pumping around in
          there, and the only way you can do that is with exercise! "
          And Cooper designed a simple test: All you had to do was to
          see how far you could run, walk, and crawl in 12 minutes, then
          check your distance against the figures in the Aerobics book
          to find out what kind of shape you were in.<br>
          <br>
          And, the book also described methods to improve your score. If
          you follow Cooper's recommendations, you will almost certainly
          improve your physical fitness. It's the same with Oramedics,
          if you follow the instructions contained in our books and
          material, you will almost certainly improve your oral health.
          Now, before Aerobics was published people knew that exercise
          was good . . . but how many folks did you see out jogging
          then? Today, of course, there are millions of people who have
          personal running programs. I jog myself, every morning, but I
          didn't until somebody reached me! That's what Oramedics does:
          It allows the dentist to reach his or her patients, and those
          people do start cleaning their mouths . . . and clean teeth do
          not decay and they do not foster gum disease. It's really that
          simple.<br>
          <br>
          PLOWBOY: Dr. Nara, many people are going to read this
          interview, and I'd suspect that a number of them will want to
          try Oramedics for themselves. Is there any way that these
          people can locate an Oramedics practitioner in their areas?
          NARA: Not at this time . . . at least not without great
          difficulty. There are some 600 practicing Oramedics Fellows in
          the world today, but--because of the tremendous confrontation
          that's going on--those who live in the U.S. have to "keep a
          low profile''. If someone were to call one of these
          practitioners and ask. ''Doctor, do you do Oramedics? ". . .
          the dentist might well be afraid to say yes, for fear of
          reprisals from the dental associations.<br>
          <br>
          PLOWBOY: Because your yellow pages ad simply said that you
          practiced Oramedics ... and that was one of the factors that
          led to your loss of license.<br>
          <br>
          NARA: Exactly, for the simple reason that the dental
          profession doesn't recognize Oramedics--or any form of
          preventive dentistry--as a specialty.<br>
          <br>
          PLOWBOY: Well, since Oramedics dentists are not readily
          available, can you describe an "aerobics" kind of oral hygiene
          program that could be followed at home<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over a period of almost 20 years of using
          these methods, we have never failed to eliminate dental
          disease from the mouth of anyone who has cooperated with us
          ... anyone who was willing to try. <br>
          <br>
          ... or even on a remote farmstead?<br>
          <br>
          NARA: The first thing that I would recommend-- to any persons
          interested in having a healthy mouth--is much like the first
          step in the aerobics program: that is, they should take a test
          to find out where they stand. This sort of evaluation is
          necessary before a course of action can be planned.<br>
          <br>
          Now, the best of these tests is the saliva examination that I
          mentioned before, the "lactobacillus test". And that
          examination is within reach of anyone who has access to the
          postal system. People can mail in a saliva sample, have the
          laboratory work performed, and receive a very specific report
          ... which will detail their oral health problems and tell them
          what to do in order to cure those problems.<br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          PLOWBOY: Tell me how and where these samples can be sent.<br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          NARA: We are offering this service through Oramedics
          International. If someone writes to us saying that he/she
          would like to have an Oramedics evaluation, we will mail back
          a sample jar and a series of forms to fill out. The forms
          detail both dental and medical histories. Then, we'll report
          our findings--based upon the lactobacillus count and the
          patient's case history and recommend a home care, self-help
          program which will enable the person to improve his or her
          oral ecology while spending as little as five minutes a day on
          dental hygiene. We also will ask that another saliva sample be
          submitted after the patient has followed our recommendations
          for a month. Most people will be well on the way to dental
          health by then, and we can put them on a "maintenance program"
          which--if followed--will almost insure a lifetime of freedom
          from dental disease!<br>
          <br>
          In addition to these services, anyone requesting an evaluation
          will receive a 20-page booklet and a tape cassette explaining
          the background of the Oramedics program. The total cost for
          both tests, plus the evaluation, the recommendations, and so
          forth is $24. (This test is no longer available. -Ed.)<br>
          <br>
          PLOWBOY: That sounds quite reasonable.<br>
          <br>
          NARA: This system is something that we've devised since my
          license was suspended. When the dental associations stopped me
          from drilling and filling, I decided to find another way to
          help the public understand their mouths and keep their teeth
          and gums healthy. I don't need a license to perform this
          service ... anyone who understands oral physiology and
          microbiology could do the same thing.<br>
          <br>
          PLOWBOY: Are most of the materials that you would recommend
          available without a prescription?<br>
          <br>
          NARA: Yes ... in fact, we describe all of the items that are
          needed, and the patient can then either procure them in a
          drugstore or order the materials directly from Oramedics
          International.<br>
          <br>
          PLOWBOY: It sounds as if we may well be entering an era of
          do-it-yourself dentistry!&nbsp; How might this trend--assuming
          that the Oramedics approach gains public acceptance--change
          the American dental care system?<br>
          <br>
          NARA: The major change I foresee is that organized dentistry
          will be forced--by public opinion--to create a special field
          for preventive dentists. There are over 15,000 physicians in
          this country who are board-certified in preventive medicine .
          . . but not one dentist who is so recognized.<br>
          <br>
          Therefore, I feel that the dental associations will have to
          develop some form of certification for those dentists who wish
          to specialize in treating the cause of the disease rather than
          simply repairing the damage that the illness does.<br>
          <br>
          When this recognition becomes available, there will probably
          be a split between those people who are interested in
          prevention and those men and women who are more concerned with
          prosthesis ... dentures, partials, that sort of thing. In
          fact. I wouldn't be at all surprised to see a violent parting
          of the ways occur, a split that would--in effect--create two
          specific professions.<br>
          Another, although less significant, change will take place on
          the legislative level: Dentists will be allowed to advertise
          in all parts of the country. Some states, of course, already
          allow medical advertising, but almost every dental ad that's
          placed-- today-- is denture related . . .''Plates: In by 10,
          Out by 5", that sort of thing. You'd have to look long and
          hard to find a dentist who advertises him- or herself to be a
          proponent of curing the disease!<br>
          <br>
          PLOWBOY: Is this lack of "preventive" advertising due to the
          fact that the profession doesn't certify prevention as a
          specialty?<br>
          <br>
          NARA: That's one of the reasons. Primarily, however, our
          shortage of dentists who practice prevention is due to the
          fact that the "system" places an economic premium on the
          repair and replacement of teeth. Even the insurance companies
          that are now involved in dentistry are mainly offering
          assistance in getting fillings, bridges, and repairs in
          general. Most dental policies will cover little if any
          preventive care . . . they are only an aid in cleaning up the
          mess left by the disease.<br>
          <br>
          PLOWBOY: Dr. Nara. the very fact that you've held up in the
          face of 10 years of harassment proves that you believe in what
          you're doing. Can you tell me why you've stuck with it . . .
          what do you hope to accomplish in your career?<br>
          <br>
          NARA: The principles that I'm operating on today are based on
          the belief that one person with the truth can constitute a
          majority. I believe the truth is that dental disease can be
          eradicated. Of course, this will only happen if the "healers"
          are able to reach the public. The message must be presented in
          such a way that people find it valuable. Sadly enough, though,
          we can't -- at this time -- count on the dental profession to
          relay that message.<br>
          <br>
          So, one of my immediate goals is to solicit the aid of allied
          health professions. There are, for example, several
          chiropractors who are already practicing Oramedics, and I plan
          to take the whole concept of preventive dentistry out of the
          hands of the dental profession ... if that's what's necessary
          to get the job done.<br>
          <br>
          PLOWBOY: Why did you choose to go to the chiropractors?<br>
          <br>
          NARA: Well, as you may know, chiropractic medicine has come a
          long way in the past few years. The "back crackers'' of old
          are probably better versed in holistic and nutritional health
          care than any other medical profession in America. They have
          moved forward while all the rest have stood still.<br>
          <br>
          And, along those same lines. I have written a book that should
          be available in January 1979. It's called Money by the
          Mouthful: Everything That You Need to Know, About the Health
          of your Mouth and Body That No Doctor's Going to Tell You. I'm
          so sure of the value of this book that it is completely
          guaranteed . . . anyone who doesn't find Money By the Mouthful
          worth the price can simply send in a post card, get the
          purchase price back, and keep the book.<br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          PLOWBOY: Will this volume take the Oramedics case directly to
          the people?<br>
          <br>
          NARA: Yes, and I expect many of them will be surprised at what
          they read. Oramedics is, you see, nothing new. We aren't
          claiming to have come up with a revolutionary system ... we're
          not pushing any "miracle" drugs or anything like that. We are
          simply offering a commonsense approach to dental health, and
          the likes of that has never been available to the American
          people before. Oramedics is nothing more--and nothing
          less--than the simplest route to a disease-free oral ecology.
          And I think that anyone who is interested in regaining control
          over his or her life and body will surely want to know about
          it.<br>
