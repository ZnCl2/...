      <br>
      Most existing and anticipated autonomous supercavitating vehicles
      rely on rocket-type motors to generate the required thrust. But
      conventional rockets entail some serious drawbacks - limited range
      and declining thrust performance with the rise of pressure as
      depth increases. The first of these problems is being addressed
      with a new kind of high-energy-density power-plant technology; the
      second may be circumvented by using a special kind of
      supercavitating propeller screw technology.<br>
      point<br>
      <br>
      NEUTRALIZING MINES. Everyone has seen action-movie heroes avoid
      fusillades of bullets by diving several feet underwater. The
      bullets ricochet away or expend their energy surprisingly rapidly
      as a result of drag and lateral hydrodynamic forces. When the
      Office of Naval Research was asked to find a cost-effective way to
      stop thousand-dollar surface mines from damaging or destroying
      multimillion-dollar ships, they turned to supercavitating
      projectiles. The result was RAMICS - the Rapid Airborne Mine
      Clearance System, which is being developed for the U.S. Navy by a
      team led by Raytheon Naval &amp; Maritime Integrated Systems in
      Portsmouth, R.I. Operating from helicopters, RAMICS will locate
      subsurface sea mines with an imaging blue-green lidar (light
      detection and ranging) system, calculate their exact position
      despite the bending of light by water refraction, and then shoot
      them with supercavitating rounds that travel stably in both air
      and water. The special projectiles contain charges that cause the
      deflagration, or moderated burning, of the mine's explosive.<br>
      <br>
      "Getting up to supercavitation speeds requires a lot of power,"
      says researcher Savchenko. "For maximum range with rockets, you
      need to burn high-energy-density fuels that provide the maximum
      specific impulse." He estimates that a typical solid-rocket motor
      can achieve a maximum range of several tens of kilometers and a
      top speed of perhaps 200 meters per second. After considering
      propulsion systems based on diesel engines, electric motors,
      atomic power plants, high-speed diesels, and gas turbines,
      Savchenko concluded that "only high-efficiency gas turbines and
      jet propulsion systems burning metal fuels (aluminum, magnesium or
      lithium) and using outboard water as both the fuel oxidizer and
      coolant of the combustion products have real potential for
      propelling supercavitating vehicles to high velocities."<br>
      <br>
      Aluminum, which is relatively cheap, is the most energetic of
      these metal fuels, producing a reaction temperature of up to
      10,600 degrees Celsius. "One can accelerate the reaction by
      fluidizing [melting] the metal and using water vapor," Savchenko
      explains. In one candidate power-plant design, the heat from the
      combustion chamber would be used to melt stored aluminum sheets at
      about 675 degrees C and to vaporize seawater as well. The
      resulting combustion products turn turbine-driven propeller
      screws.<br>
      <br>
      This type of system has already been developed in Russia,
      according to media reports there. The U.S. also has experience
      with these kinds of systems. Researchers at Penn State's Applied
      Research Laboratory are operating an aluminum-burning "water
      ramjet" system, which was developed as an auxiliary power source
      for a naval surface ship. In the novel American design, powdered
      aluminum feeds into a whirlpool of seawater occurring in what is
      called a vortex combustor. The rapid rotation scrapes the
      particles together, grinding off the inert aluminum oxide film
      that covers them, which initiates an intense exothermic reaction
      as the aluminum oxidizes. High-pressure steam from this combustion
      process expands out a rocket nozzle or drives a turbine that turns
      a propeller screw.<br>
      <br>
      Tests have shown that prop screws offer the potential to boost
      thrust by 20 percent compared with that of rockets, although in
      theory it may be possible for screws to double available thrust,
      Savchenko says. Designs for a turbo-rotor propeller system with a
      single supercavitating "hull propeller," or a pair of
      counterrotating hull props that encircle the outer surface of the
      craft so they can reach the gas/water boundary, have been tested.
      He emphasizes, however, that "considerable work remains to be done
      on how the propeller and cavity must interact" before real
      progress can be made. ...<br>

      Research is also being conducted using thermal units to provide
      low-rate energy sources. The thermal conversion activities include
      the development of a small, closed-cycle Stirling engine coupled
      to a lithium-sulfur hexaflouride thermal-energy source. A novel
      wick combustor is being developed for this unit using capillarity
      to distribute the liquid metal.<br>
      <br>
      High-rate energy sources are being evaluated for potential use in
      torpedoes and in countermeasure applications. There are two main
      ONR activities in this field, HYDROX, a hydrogen and oxygen
      producer and combustor, and an aluminum-water vortex combustor for
      a water ramjet.<br>
      <br>
      The HYDROX energy system produces gaseous oxygen from liquid
      lithium perchlorate and hydrogen from the reaction of water and a
      lithium-aluminum alloy. The gaseous hydrogen and oxygen produced
      are burned in a combustion chamber to produce steam for a closed
      Rankine-cycle system. The same gas source could provide the
      hydrogen and oxygen for a fuel cell. The gases could also be used
      in a combined system utilizing a low-power unit for low-speed
      search and a high-power unit for high-speed operations. The
      innovative wick system to distribute liquid metal is being
      developed for use in the SCEPS (lithium-sulfur hexafluoride)
      upgrade.<br>
      <br>
      A novel vortex combustor is being developed for the water ramjet
      that would propel the high-speed supercavitating vehicle. Aluminum
      particles are burned in a vortex arrangement in a reaction with
      water. This unit, although potentially useful as a source of
      high-density energy for the supercavitating ramjet, could be used
      in other applications. The production of large volumes of gaseous
      hydrogen from the aluminum-water reaction could, perhaps, be
      utilized to increase the energy density.<br>
      <br>
      The high-rate-wick Stirling engine can be employed in torpedoes
      and manned undersea vehicles and/or UUVs to enhance range, speed,
      and endurance. The HYDROX system could be used in high-rate,
      low-rate, or hybrid modes to enable smaller vehicles or superior
      performance. The aluminum-seawater vortex device could provide
      very high speed in special applications. These innovative
      approaches are good examples of revolutionary technology from ONR
      programs.<br>
      <br>
      Other propulsion S&amp;T efforts include those on electrochemical
      energy sources, including fuel cells at the Naval Undersea Warfare
      Center (NUWC), Naval Surface Warfare Center, Carderock Division
      (NSWC/CD), and several small academic and industrial contractors.
      The electrochemical area is the largest component of the undersea
      weapons 6.1 budget ($2 million in FY99). Another effort is that on
      underwater propellants at the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Indian
      Head (NSWC/IH).<br>
      <br>
      Finding: The program on propulsion at the Applied Research
      Laboratory, Pennsylvania State University (ARL/PSU) is exemplary
      and offers technologies for both weapons and vehicles that could
      be used in future systems. Closed-cycle engines are among the
      increasingly attractive options as the importance of stealth and
      endurance increases...<br>

      </b><b>1.4 Objectives and Approach</b><br>
      The&nbsp; objective&nbsp; of&nbsp; this&nbsp; thesis&nbsp; is
      to&nbsp; estimate&nbsp; the&nbsp; power&nbsp; output&nbsp;
      and&nbsp; overall&nbsp; efficiency&nbsp; of&nbsp; the
      Rankine&nbsp; Cycle&nbsp; propulsion&nbsp; system&nbsp;
      outlined&nbsp; in&nbsp; Figure 1.4.&nbsp; It&nbsp; is&nbsp;
      based&nbsp; on&nbsp; the&nbsp; exothermic reaction&nbsp; of&nbsp;
      aluminum&nbsp; powder&nbsp; with&nbsp; sea&nbsp; water&nbsp;
      and&nbsp; a&nbsp; prototype&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; system&nbsp;
      is&nbsp; presently being&nbsp; constructed&nbsp; by&nbsp;
      ARL&nbsp; for&nbsp; DARPA. The&nbsp; prototype is&nbsp;
      intended&nbsp; for&nbsp; use&nbsp; in&nbsp; small (10,000lb)
      Unmanned Underwater Vehicles (UUVs) like the Sea Horse.&nbsp;
      &nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      The&nbsp; basic&nbsp; operation&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp;
      system&nbsp; is&nbsp; as&nbsp; follows : Aluminum powder is
      suspended in a small flow of gaseous hydrogen and transported to a
      combustor where it reacts exothermically&nbsp; with&nbsp;
      steam&nbsp; to&nbsp; form&nbsp; Al2O3(s)&nbsp; and&nbsp; H2.
      Additional water injected into&nbsp; the reacting&nbsp; flow cools
      the hot products, producing&nbsp; steam. The combustion products
      pass through a separator to remove the solid Al2O3. Most of the
      steam hydrogen mix is then passed&nbsp; to&nbsp; a&nbsp;
      turbine&nbsp; that&nbsp; drives&nbsp; an&nbsp; alternator.&nbsp; A
      small fraction of the steam/hydrogen is diverted&nbsp; from&nbsp;
      the&nbsp; separator,&nbsp; cooled&nbsp; to&nbsp; 900F&nbsp;
      by&nbsp; a&nbsp; small&nbsp; amount&nbsp; of&nbsp; fresh&nbsp;
      sea&nbsp; water, compressed,&nbsp; and&nbsp; returned&nbsp;
      to&nbsp; the&nbsp; entrance&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp;
      combustor&nbsp; to&nbsp; sustain&nbsp; the&nbsp; reaction&nbsp;
      with incoming&nbsp; Aluminum&nbsp; powder.&nbsp; Enthalpy
      remaining&nbsp; in&nbsp; the flow&nbsp; exiting&nbsp; the&nbsp;
      turbine&nbsp; is recovered using a heat exchanger and pre-heats
      the combustor cooling water. The steam is&nbsp; finally&nbsp;
      condensed&nbsp; and&nbsp; separated&nbsp; from&nbsp; the&nbsp;
      H2.&nbsp; The&nbsp; water&nbsp; is&nbsp; recycled&nbsp;
      through&nbsp; a&nbsp; pump which&nbsp; draws&nbsp; in&nbsp;
      an&nbsp; appropriate&nbsp; amount&nbsp; of&nbsp; fresh&nbsp;
      water&nbsp; to&nbsp; make&nbsp; up&nbsp; for&nbsp; that&nbsp;
      spend&nbsp; during combustion.&nbsp; The&nbsp; hydrogen&nbsp;
      gas&nbsp; is&nbsp; compressed and&nbsp; fed back&nbsp; into&nbsp;
      the&nbsp; fuel&nbsp; feeder,&nbsp; thus completing the cycle. <br>
      <br>
      The&nbsp; approach&nbsp; taken&nbsp; to&nbsp; estimate&nbsp;
      the&nbsp; system’s&nbsp; performance is to develop&nbsp;
      thermodynamic models for each individual component in the system,
      and then to assemble the individual models to create a model of
      the entire&nbsp; system.&nbsp; This is accomplished&nbsp; using a
      specialized software package called Numerical&nbsp;
      Propulsion&nbsp; System Solver&nbsp; (NPSS)&nbsp; [37],&nbsp;
      which&nbsp; was originally&nbsp; developed by the NASA Glenn
      Research Center&nbsp; as&nbsp; a&nbsp; generalized&nbsp;
      design&nbsp; and analysis&nbsp; tool&nbsp; for&nbsp;
      developing&nbsp; gas&nbsp; turbine&nbsp; engines&nbsp;
      although&nbsp; it&nbsp; is&nbsp; equally&nbsp; well-suited&nbsp;
      for Rankine&nbsp; Cycle&nbsp; analyses.&nbsp; The&nbsp;
      principal&nbsp; advantage&nbsp; of NPSS&nbsp; is&nbsp; that&nbsp;
      it&nbsp; takes&nbsp; care&nbsp; of&nbsp; the mathematical&nbsp;
      difficulties&nbsp; associated&nbsp; with&nbsp; solving&nbsp;
      systems&nbsp; of&nbsp; interacting&nbsp; thermodynamic
      components,&nbsp; enabling&nbsp; the&nbsp; focus&nbsp; to&nbsp;
      be&nbsp; placed&nbsp; on&nbsp; developing&nbsp; appropriate&nbsp;
      component models.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NPSS&nbsp; creates&nbsp;
      generalized&nbsp; data&nbsp; structures&nbsp; for&nbsp;
      passing&nbsp; information&nbsp; between components and implements
      a Newton-Rhapson solver to find stable operating points. <br>
      <br>
      Other&nbsp; important&nbsp; advantages&nbsp; of&nbsp; NPSS&nbsp;
      are&nbsp; its&nbsp; graphical&nbsp; user&nbsp; interface&nbsp;
      with&nbsp; extensive libraries of pre-defined components, the
      ability to develop new components and add them <br>
      to the library, and a very high degree of flexibility in the types
      of component models that it&nbsp; can&nbsp;
      accept.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For&nbsp; example,&nbsp; a&nbsp;
      turbine&nbsp; could&nbsp; be&nbsp; modeled&nbsp; in&nbsp;
      NPSS&nbsp; either&nbsp; by&nbsp; writing&nbsp; a module in C that
      incorporates the simple&nbsp; governing equations found in a
      textbook (with overall&nbsp; efficiency&nbsp; as&nbsp; a&nbsp;
      parameter),&nbsp; by&nbsp; using&nbsp; a&nbsp;
      multi-dimensional&nbsp; turbine&nbsp; map,&nbsp; or&nbsp; by
      linking&nbsp; to&nbsp; an&nbsp; external&nbsp; 3D&nbsp; CFD&nbsp;
      simulation.&nbsp; It&nbsp; also&nbsp; facilitates&nbsp; the&nbsp;
      evaluation&nbsp; of&nbsp; many design&nbsp; changes&nbsp;
      without&nbsp; having&nbsp; to&nbsp; perform&nbsp; an&nbsp;
      experiment.&nbsp; The&nbsp; solver&nbsp; is&nbsp; capable&nbsp; of
      incorporating thermodynamic elements in a time-varying or steady
      state operating mode. <br>
      <br>
      A full description of NPSS and the NPSS system model will be
      presented in chapter 2 of the thesis.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      While the NPSS model is a powerful design tool that can be used to
      explore a very wide parameter space, this type of modeling effort
      poses its own challenges and trade-offs.&nbsp; In particular, when
      combining many different levels of model&nbsp; fidelity&nbsp;
      among&nbsp; different model&nbsp; elements&nbsp;
      (combustion,&nbsp; cooling,&nbsp; separation,&nbsp; etc)&nbsp;
      additional&nbsp; considerations&nbsp; must&nbsp; be made and a
      “multi-disciplinary design optimization” or MDO should be
      considered [38]. &nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      NPSS&nbsp; allows&nbsp; the&nbsp; user&nbsp; to&nbsp;
      perform&nbsp; low&nbsp; level&nbsp; ‘sensitivity&nbsp;

      <b>GOVERNMENT INTEREST</b><br>
      [0002] This invention was made with government support under
      Contract No. N0024-02-6604/0031 awarded by the Defense Advanced
      Research Projects Agency. The Government has certain rights in the
      invention.<br>
      <br>
      <b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      [0003] The present invention is related to an aluminum combustion
      power system, and in particular an aluminum combustion power
      system that reacts water with aluminum powder to produce molten
      aluminum oxide droplets, heat, steam, and hydrogen.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      [0004] The use of internal combustion engines, batteries, jet
      propulsion, and the like to provide power to underwater vehicles
      is known. In addition, the use of batteries has exhibited limited
      success, however the energy density of battery powered systems has
      been less than desirable.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] As an alternative, the chemical reaction of aluminum with
      water, fresh or salt, is known to be highly energetic and has been
      proposed as a basis for an energy producing system. The basic
      reaction between aluminum and water is<br>
      <br>
      2A1 + 3H20→ A1203 + 3H2 Equation 1 with the products of this
      reaction exhibiting temperatures up to 3800°F. However, such
      temperatures and products have heretofore proven to be impractical
      for power systems that can provide a steady and sustained flow of
      energy. Therefore, even though the above chemical reaction is
      extremely energy favorable, the use of aluminum as a fuel to
      provide a reliable source of energy has proven evasive. Therefore,
      a power source that reacts aluminum with water and provides
      reliable power would be desirable. <br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      [0006] The present invention discloses an engine that reacts
      aluminum with water to produce electrical and/or mechanical power.
      The engine can include a fuel made at least partly from aluminum
      powder that flows like liquid under high pressure. The engine can
      also include a steam feedback system, a combustor, a fuel feed
      system, a fuel injection system, and a water supply system.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] The combustor can have an inlet, an outlet, and a combustor
      wall, and the fuel feed system is operable to pump the fuel from a
      fuel tank to the combustor. The fuel injection system can mix
      steam that is fed back or recirculated from the combustor
      discharge via a small compressor or generated from a recuperator
      with the fuel and then spray the fuel and the steam mixture into
      the combustor. The water supply system can spray water into the
      combustor and the water can react with the aluminum powder to
      produce molten aluminum oxide droplets, heat, steam, and hydrogen.
      In addition, the water can solidify the molten aluminum oxide
      droplets before they contact the combustor wall and thereby
      prevent clogging of the combustor.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] The aluminum powder can be coated, for example with a film
      of methysiloxane, such that the coated aluminum powder can be
      pumped through tubing having a length to diameter ratio of greater
      than 1000. In addition, the fuel feed system is operable to
      provide a steady flow of the coated aluminum powder at high
      pressure to the combustor. The mixture of aluminum powder and
      steam reacts with water in the combustor to produce the molten
      aluminum oxide droplets, heat, additional steam, and hydrogen. The
      water supply system can include a plurality of spray nozzles that
      can spray water into the combustor and cool the combustor wall. In
      addition, a high temperature separator downstream from the
      combustor can separate solidified aluminum oxide particles from an
      aluminum oxide particle- steam mixture that exits the outlet of
      the combustor. In this manner, steam without harmful and/or
      erosive aluminum oxide particles can be provided to a steam
      turbine to produce electrical and/or mechanical power.<br>

      <b> </b><b><br>
      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      [0016] The present invention provides an engine that reacts
      aluminum with water to produce electrical and/or mechanical power.
      As such, the present invention has use as a power source.<br>
      <br>
      [0017] The power system can include a combustor that is operable
      to accept aluminum powder mixed with steam. In addition, the
      combustor can have water sprayed thereinto, the water reacting
      with the aluminum powder to form molten aluminum oxide droplets,
      steam, heat, and hydrogen. In addition, sufficient water can be
      provided to the combustor such that excess steam is provided and
      used to drive/power a steam turbine as is known to those skilled
      in the art.<br>
      <br>
      [0018] The aluminum powder can be coated such that it flows like a
      liquid and can be provided from a fuel container to the combustor
      using a fuel line having a length to diameter ratio of greater
      than 1000. In addition, the aluminum powder can be mixed with the
      steam prior to entering the combustor such that the mixture
      expands like a gas upon entering a combustion zone. Aluminum
      particles can then react with water within the combustion zone via
      the chemical reaction of Equation 1 and as described in greater
      detail below. Water can also be introduced into the combustor such
      that it cools the walls thereof and solidifies molten aluminum
      oxide droplets formed by the reaction of the aluminum powder with
      the water. Cooling of the molten aluminum oxide droplets before
      they come into contact with the combustor wall prevents their
      accumulation thereon and thus prevents clogging of the combustor.
      As such, aluminum oxide particles plus steam exit the combustor
      and enters a high temperature separator that affords for the
      removal or separation of solidified aluminum oxide particles from
      the steam. Thereafter, the steam can be provided to a steam
      turbine which rotates to provide mechanical and/or electrical
      power. It is appreciated that a recuperator, condenser, low
      temperature separator, steam compressor, etc., can also be
      included as part of the power system in order to increase power
      output, efficiency, safety and the like. [0019] A reaction in
      which excess water can be included to regulate the product
      temperature of aluminum reacting with water can be:<br>
      <br>
      2A1 + 3H20 + XH20→ A1203 + 3H2 + XH20 Equation 2 where X moles of
      excess water can be included to regulate the temperature of a
      system that burns aluminum in this manner. In some instances, the
      X moles of excess diluent water can appear in the products as X
      moles of superheated steam and the steam can be used to provide
      energy, for example through the use of a steam turbine. It is
      appreciated that the number of moles of excess water required can
      depend on the product discharge temperature and the temperature of
      liquid water added to the reaction. For example, a product
      temperature in the vicinity of 1500°F will result in a gaseous
      mixture of 97.5% steam.<br>
      <br>
      [0020] While Equation 2 is relatively simple and energetically
      favorable, sustaining such a reaction using readily available cold
      seawater can be difficult. In particular, solid aluminum does not
      appreciably react with cold water. As such, and as discussed in
      more detail below, the present invention affords for high
      temperature steam to be provided to the reaction of aluminum with
      water. The aluminum can readily react with the high temperature
      steam in order to provide sufficient heat to maintain the
      A1203-H20 reaction and drive a steam turbine, preheat cold
      seawater, and the like. In some instances, more or less than 3
      moles of steam might be supplied per every two moles of fuel with
      evaporating diluent water serving as reactant water if necessary.<br>
      <br>
      [0021] Turning now to Figure 1, a "black box" illustration of an
      inventive aluminum combustion power system is shown generally at
      reference numeral 10. The power system 10 can include an input of
      aluminum 110 and liquid water 120. Reaction of the aluminum 110
      with the liquid water 120 results in the production of aluminum
      oxide 140, hydrogen gas 150, and heat 160. In addition, mechanical
      or electrical power 170 can be produced from the power system 10,
      for example through the use of steam to drive a steam turbine.<br>
      <br>
      [0022] It is appreciated that if the system 10 is used underwater,
      only aluminum 110 is needed to be stored since liquid water 120
      can be provided by the environment. Such a system is analogous to
      a motor vehicle or an airplane carrying a liquid hydrocarbon fuel
      and using oxygen/air from the surrounding environment.<br>
      <br>
      [0023] In addition to maintaining the reaction of aluminum with
      water, the aluminum oxide 140 can be formed as molten liquid
      droplets with a melting/solidification temperature approaching
      3800°F. Such droplets can impinge on a surface of the system 10
      and cause accelerated corrosion, slagging, and the like. In
      particular, slagging can result in the buildup of aluminum oxide
      on internal surfaces of the system 10 and thereby result in
      clogging of the power system 10.<br>
      <br>
      [0024] Referring now to Figure 2a, an inventive aluminum combustor
      that can prevent clogging of a power system is shown generally at
      reference numeral 200. The aluminum combustor 200 can include a
      combustor can 220 with an injection tube 210. Aluminum 110 and
      steam 122 can be premixed within the injection tube 210 and
      allowed to react within the combustor can 220 to provide a
      stoichiometric combustion cloud 240. The combustor can 220 can
      have a combustor interior wall 222 which provides a physical
      barrier to the combustion cloud 240. In order to prevent
      overheating and/or slagging of the combustor interior wall 222,
      one or more water sprayers 230 can provide coolant 232, e.g.
      water, to cool the combustor interior wall 222 and quench aluminum
      oxide droplets that have formed in the combustion cloud 240. In
      some instances, the combustor can 220 can be cylindrical shaped
      with a plurality of sprayers 230 spaced apart and providing liquid
      spray 232 as shown in Figure 2b.<br>
      <br>
      [0025] For example, and for illustrative purposes only, Figure 2b
      illustrates a cylindrical combustor can 220 with six liquid
      sprayers 230 operable to provide liquid spray into the combustor
      can 220 and thereby cool the combustor interior walls 222 and/or
      quench liquid aluminum oxide droplets before reaching the interior
      walls 222. It is appreciated that the liquid spray 232 can also
      provide water which can be heated and evaporated into steam and
      thereby provide a steam shroud 250 within the combustor can 220.
      Additional water spraying nozzles 260 may or may not be provided
      to enhance the cooling of the combustor interior walls 222 and/or
      evaporation of water. As shown in the figure, hot gas and fly ash
      in the form of aluminum oxide particles 280 can exit the combustor
      can 220 through an exit 270. It is appreciated that the combustor
      220 can provide pressurized and/or superheated steam which can be
      used to power a steam turbine, extract heat therefrom, and the
      like.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] Turning now to Figure 3, a schematic diagram of an aluminum
      combustion power system is shown generally at reference numeral
      20. In addition to the combustor 200, which can in fact be a
      compact superheated steam generator, a high-temperature separator
      300 can be located downstream from the combustor 200 and afford
      for separation of more than 99% of the aluminum oxide particles
      from the oxide particle-steam mixture exiting the combustor 200.
      In addition, any remaining particles can be less than one-half
      (0.5) micron in diameter and thereby pass through a turbine 310
      safely. The turbine 310 may or may not have a direct drive with a
      high-speed alternator 320, the alternator 320 operable to generate
      alternating current which can be rectified and otherwise
      conditioned to provide a regulated direct current voltage. In some
      instances, the turbine 310 and alternator 320 can be water cooled
      and use water lubricated hybrid bearings.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] It is appreciated that exhaust from the turbine 310 can
      contain considerable energy content and, as such, a recuperator
      330 can be used to transfer heat from the turbine exhaust to
      liquid water in the form of incoming seawater, freshwater and/or
      water condensed from the exhaust steam. By preheating water
      supplied to the combustor water sprayers 230, more water can be
      added to the combustor 200 in order to maintain a desired
      combustor discharge temperature. The additional water added to the
      combustor 200 can be converted into steam and thereby increase
      steam flow from the combustor 200 and through the turbine 310. In
      this manner, the output power from the turbine 310 and the overall
      efficiency of the system 20 can be increased. It is appreciated
      that the hydrogen flowing out of the recuperator represents a
      considerable potential energy source and in certain instances may
      be directed to a secondary combustor, electrochemical fuel cell of
      other conversion system to enhance overall system efficiency.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] Cooler steam leaving the recuperator 330 can be condensed
      in a condenser 340 to liquid water and thereafter discharged to a
      low-temperature separator 350. The low-temperature separator 350
      can separate gaseous hydrogen which may or may not be pumped
      overboard with any residual aluminum oxide. In some instances, a
      portion of hydrogen compressed in the low-temperature separator
      can be retained for feed system use. In addition, a water pump 360
      can pump surrounding seawater, freshwater and/or steam condensate
      from the low-temperature separator 350 and raise the pressure of
      the liquid to above the pressure in the combustor 200 for use in
      the water sprayers 230.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] A steam compressor 400 can also be included and provide
      high-temperature steam for combustion of the aluminum powder. In
      some instances, clean steam can be taken from the high-temperature
      separator 300, passed through the steam compressor 400, and mixed
      with aluminum powder from the fuel feed system 100. In addition,
      temperature(s) of the aluminum powder fuel and steam from the
      steam compressor 400 at the inlet 210 of the combustor 200 can be
      controlled and/or reduced by addition of liquid water.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] Referring specifically to the flow of the aluminum powder,
      Figures 4a-4b illustrate an embodiment of the fuel feed system
      100. It is appreciated that the flow of aluminum particles under
      pressure can be an area of concern for an aluminum power system
      with uneven flow rates, clogging of fuel lines and the like known
      to be problem areas. However, the fuel feed system 100 having
      aluminum particles 110 can include treatment of the particles with
      a silane, e.g. methylethoxysilane, such that polarizable surface
      groups such as hydroxyl groups can be replaced with siloxane
      groups or other non-polarizable, hydrophobic terminal groups and
      result in the: (1) elimination and/or reduction of van der Waals
      forces; (2) elimination and/or reduction of susceptibility to
      triboelectric augmentation of cohesion between the particles;
      and/or (3) suppression of cohesion due to capillary condensation.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] The treatment can include providing a monolayer thick film
      of siloxane onto the surface of the aluminum particles and placing
      the particles in the cylinder of a piston-cylinder device. A
      piston 104 that has a funnel shape on one face and a flat shape on
      an opposite face can be forced, e.g. by gas pressure, into the
      fuel 110. The conical face of the piston 104 can then move into
      the fuel, thereby forcing the fuel to flow through a screen 108.
      In addition, inert gas can be forced into the fuel 110 through an
      inlet line 102, and as the piston 104 moves into the fuel 110 and
      the fuel passes through a fuel line 106, the inert gas in the
      interstitial spaces of the fuel can expand and provide a
      dense-phase fluidized particulate flow.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] In some instances, a coiled flexible fuel line 106 having a
      s-inch diameter with a i6-inch bore can be used to provide
      aluminum powder to the combustor 200. For example and for
      illustrative purposes only, such a fuel line 106 can provide
      sufficient aluminum powder fuel for a 100 hp/75 kW turbine output.
      In addition, a metal rod can be used to move with the piston 104
      so that a position of the piston can be known as a function of
      time, thereby allowing for a fuel flow rate to be calculated.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] An alternative embodiment of a fuel feed system is shown in
      Figure 5 at reference numeral 500. The fuel feed system 500 can
      have a container 505 with a bladder 510 that has aluminum powder
      fuel 110 therewithin. Pressure can be applied to a back side of
      bladder 510 in the region 540 and a feeder transport 520 can be
      used to provide the aluminum powder 110 to an exit orifice 530. In
      some instances, the feeder transport 520 can have a shaft 524 with
      an arbor plate 522, the shaft 524 and arbor plate 522 acting as a
      screw drive to transport the powder 110 from within the bladder
      510 to the exit 530. In addition, aluminum oxide particles that
      exit from the combustor 200 can be separated from the steam/fly
      ash mixture and placed in the area 540 around the back side of the
      bladder 510 which was previously occupied by the aluminum powder
      110. In this manner, the aluminum oxide particles can be stored on
      or within an underwater vehicle.<br>

      while maintaining stable combustion and low NOx emissions. The
      combustor is useful in gas turbines in a process of burning
      synfuels, as it offers the opportunity to avoid use of diluent gas
      to reduce combustion temperatures. The combustor also offers the
