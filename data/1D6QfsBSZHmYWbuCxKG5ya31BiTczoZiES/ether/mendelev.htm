      <p>Translated from the Russian by George Kamensky (Imperial Mint,
        St. Petersburg) </p>
      <p>Longmans, Green &amp; Co, NY (1904) </p>
      <hr width="62%">
      <p>In his <i>Dictionaire Complet</i>, P. Larousse defines the
        ether as ‘an imponderable elastic fluid, filling space and
        forming the source of light, heat, electricity, etc.’ This is
        laconic, but sufficient to raise some misgivings in the mind of
        a thoughtful man of science. He is obliged to admit, in the
        ether, the properties of a substance (fluid), while at the same
        time, in order to explain in some way the transmission of energy
        through space by its motion, the ether is assumed to be an
        all-pervading ‘medium’. Moreover, in order to explain the
        phenomena of light, electricity, and even gravity, this medium
        is supposed to undergo various disturbances (perturbations) and
        changes in its structure (deformation), like those observed in
        solids, liquids and gases. If the fluid medium permeates
        everything and everywhere, it cannot be said to have weight,
        just as the ponderability of air could not be recognized before
        the invention of the air pump. Yet the ether must have weight,
        because, since the days of Galileo and Newton, the quality of
        gravitation or of weight forms a primary property of substances.
        From various considerations Lord Kelvin came to the conclusion
        that a cubic meter of ether should weigh about and not less than
        0.000,000,000,000,000,1 gram, while a cubic meter of the
        lightest gas, hydrogen, weighs 90 grams under the atmospheric
        pressure. The above-mentioned misgivings of the thoughtful
        scientist in his most plausible endeavors to ascribe a certain
        weight or mass to the ether, for the question naturally arises:
        At what pressure and temperature will this weight be proper to
        ether? For at infinitely small pressures or exceedingly high
        temperatures steam or hydrogen would have as small a density as
        that given by Lord Kelvin for the ether. And as regards the
        density of the ether in interplanetary space, neither steam nor
        hydrogen would have a measurable density in these regions,
        notwithstanding the extreme cold, for the pressure would be
        infinitely small. Theoretically, space may be supposed to be
        filled with such rarified residues of vapors and gases. And this
        view even corresponds with Kant’s and LaPlace’s and other
        theories, which strive to explain the unity of plan in the
        creation of the heavenly bodies. It also accounts for the
        uniformity of the chemical composition of the entire universe,
        demonstrated by the spectroscope, as it gives a means, through
        the agency of such ether, of interchange between the heavenly
        bodies. One of the objects of an investigation into the
        elasticity or compressibility of gases under low pressure,
        undertaken by me in the 1870s, was to trace, as far as the then
        existing methods of measuring low pressures permitted, the
        changes proceeding in gases under low pressures. The
        discrepancies from Boyle’s law observed (by me and M.
        Kirpitchnikoff, 1874) for all gases, and subsequently confirmed
        by Ramsay and others (although still denied by some
        investigators), indicate a certain uniformity in the behavior of
        all gases and a tendency in them towards a certain limiting
        expansion at low pressures, just as there is a limit to
        compression (liquefaction and the critical state). But
        determinations of very low pressures are accompanied by
        insurmountable difficulties. It proved practically impossible to
        measure, with any degree of accuracy, pressures under tenths of
        a millimeter of mercury, and this is far too large a figure for
        such rarified media as are supposed to exist at an elevation of
        even 50 kilometers above sea level. Hence the conception of the
        ether as a highly rarified atmospheric gas cannot so far be
        subjected to experimental investigation and measurement, which
        alone can direct the mind in the right direction and lead to
        reliable results. </p>
      <p>But, beyond this, the conception of the ether as a limiting
        state of expansion of vapors and gases cannot sustain even the
        most elementary analysis, for ether cannot be understood
        otherwise than as an all-pervading ubiquitous substance, and
        this is not the property of either gases or vapors. Both the
        latter are liquefiable under pressure, and cannot be said to
        permeate all substances, although they are widely distributed in
        mature, even in meteorites. Moreover -- and this is the most
        important -- they vary infinitely in their chemical nature and
        in their relations to other substances, while the ether, as far
        as is known, is invariable. Owing to the variety of their
        chemical properties, all vapors and gases should react
        differently on the bodies which they permeate if they were
        components of the ether. </p>
      <p>Before proceeding further, I think it necessary to justify the
        chemical views here and elsewhere brought into play. In the days
        of Galileo and Newton it was possible, although difficult, to
        conceive ether apart from them. But now it would be contrary to
        the most fundamental principles of natural science, for
        chemistry, since Lavoisier, Dalton and Avogadro Gerhardt, has
        acquired the most sacred rights of citizenship in the great
        company of the natural sciences, and by placing the mass
        (weight) of a substance among its paramount conceptions it has
        followed the path indicated by Galileo and Newton. Moreover,
        chemistry and its methods alone have promoted in science a
        desire to apprehend bodies and their phenomena in their ultimate
        relations, through a conception of the reaction of their
        infinitely small parts or atoms which may in fact be regarded as
        indivisible individuals, having nothing in common with the
        mechanically indivisible atoms of the ancient metaphysicians.
        There are many proofs of this; it will suffice to mention the
        fact that the atoms of modern science have often been explained
        by vortex rings, that there was formerly a strong inclination to
        conceive the chemical atoms as built up of themselves, or of a
        ‘primary matter’, and that recently, especially in speaking of
        the radioactive substances, a division of chemical atoms into
        yet smaller ‘electrons’ begins to be recognized; all of which
        would be logically impossible were the atom regarded as
        mechanically indivisible. Chemically the atoms may be likened to
        the heavenly bodies, the stars, sun, planets, satellites,
        comets, &amp;c. The building up of molecules from atoms, and of
        substances from molecules, is then conceived to resemble the
        building up of systems, such as the solar system, or that of
        twin stars or constellations, from these individual bodies. This
        is not a simple play of words in modern chemistry, nor a mere
        analogy, but a reality which directs the course of all chemical
        research, analysis, and synthesis. Chemistry has its own
        microscope for investigating invisible regions, and being an
        archi-real science it deals all the time with its invisible
        individualities without considering them mechanically
        indivisible. The atoms and molecules which are dealt with in all
        provinces of modern mechanics and physics cannot be other than
        the atoms and molecules defined by chemistry, for this is
        required by the unity of science. And therefore the
        metaphysicians of the present day should, for the advancement of
        knowledge, regard atoms in the same sense as that in which they
        are understood by natural science and not after the manner of
        the ancient metaphysicians of the Chinese or Greek schools. If
        the Newtonian theory of gravity revealed the existence of forces
        acting at infinitely great distances, the chemistry of
        Lavoisier, Dalton and Avogadro Gerhardt, on the other hand,
        disclosed the existence of forces of immense power acting at
        infinitely small distances, and transmutable into all other
        forms of energy, mechanical and physical. Thus all the
        present-day fundamental conceptions of natural science -- and
        consequently the conception of the ether -- must necessarily be
        considered under the combined influence of chemical, physical,
        and mechanical teachings. Although skeptical indifference is
        prone to discern only a ‘working hypothesis’ in the conception
        of the ether, yet the earnest investigator, seeking the reality
        of truth, and not the image of fantasy, is forced to ask himself
        what is the chemical nature of the ether. </p>
      <p>Before endeavoring to give an answer respecting the chemical
        nature of ether, I think it necessary to state my opinion
        regarding the belief held by some in the unity of the substance
        of the chemical elements and their origin from one primary form
        of matter. According to this view, ether consists of this
        primary matter in an unassociated form, that is, not in the form
        of the elementary atoms or molecules of substances, but as the
        constituent principle out of which the chemical atoms are
        formed. This view has much that is attractive. The atoms are
        regarded as proceeding from primary matter in the same way as
        celestial bodies are sometimes represented as being formed from
        disunited bodies, such as cosmic dust, etc. The celestial bodies
        so formed remain surrounded by the cosmic dust, etc., from which
        they took their origin. So also the atoms remain in the midst of
        the all-pervading and primary ether from which they took their
        origin. Some persons assume also that atoms can be split up into
        their dust or primary matter, just as comets break up into
        falling stars; and that, as the geological changes of the earth
        or the building up and dissociation of heavenly bodies proceed
        before our eyes, so also do the atoms break up and form again in
        the silence of their eternal evolution. Others, without denying
        the possibility of such a process in the exceptional rare cases,
        consider the world of atoms to have been established once for
        all, and do not admit the possibility of decomposing the atom
        into its primary matter, or of forming new atoms of any chemical
        element from this primary matter by experimental means. In a
        word, they regard the process of the creation of atoms as finite
        and not subject to repetition, while they consider the ether as
        the residue remaining after the formation of atoms. This view
        need not be considered here, it being solely the fruit of
        imagination and unproved by any experimental investigation. But
        the former theory of a progressive evolution of the substance of
        atoms cannot be passed unnoticed by chemistry, for fundamental
        principles of this science are the indestructibility of matter
        and the immutability of the atoms forming the elements. If ether
        were producible fro atoms and atoms could be built up from
        ether, the formation of new unlooked-for atoms and the
        disappearance of portions of the elements during experiment
        would be possible. A belief in such a possibility has long been
        held in the minds of may by force of superstition; and the more
        recent researches of Emmens to convert silver into gold, and
        those of Fittica (1900) to prove that phosphorus can be
        converted into arsenic, show that it yet exists. In the 50 years
        during which I have carefully followed the records of chemistry,
        I have met with many such instances, but they have always proved
        unfounded. It is not my purpose here to defend the independent
        individuality of the chemical elements, but I am forced to refer
        to it in speaking of the ether, for it seems to me that, besides
        being chemically invalid, it is impossible to conceive of an
        ether as a primary substance, because such a substance should
        have some mass or weight and also chemical relations -- mass in
        order to explain the majority of phenomena proceeding at all
        distances up to the infinitely great, and chemical relations in
        order to explain those proceeding at distances infinitely small
        or commensurable with the atoms. If the question were restricted
        to the ether which fills space and serves as a medium for the
        transmission of energy, it would in a way be possible to limit
        oneself to the supposition of mass without reference to its
        chemical relations and even to consider the ether as a primary
        matter, Justas the mass of a planet may be conceived without
        regarding its chemical composition. But such an indifferent,
        indefinite ether loses all sense of reality and awakens the
        misgivings of the earnest investigator, directly he realizes
        that it must permeate all substances. The necessity I an easy
        and perfect permeation of all bodies by the ether has to be
        admitted, not only for the comprehension of many physical
        phenomena (such as those o optics), but also owing to the great
        elasticity and rarity of the ethereal substance, the atoms of
        which are always conceived a being far more minute than the
        atoms and molecules of the known chemical substances. Moreover,
        this permeability of ether I all bodies explains why it cannot
        be isolated from substances, which indeed behave in respect to
        ether like a sieve to water or air. The capacity of the ether to
        penetrate all substances may, however, be regarded as the ideal
        of the diffusion of gases through metals and other diaphragms.
        Hydrogen, which ha a small atomic weight and is the lightest of
        all known gases, not only diffuses more rapidly than any other
        gas, but also has the faculty of penetrating through walls of
        such metals as platinum and palladium, which are impervious to
        other gases. This property is due, not only to the rapidity of
        motion of the molecules of hydrogen, closely connected with its
        small density, but also to a chemical faculty of the same kind
        as exhibited in the formation of metallic hydrides, of
        solutions, alloys and other indefinite compounds. The mechanism
        of this penetration may be likened (at the surface of the body
        penetrated) to the solution of a gas in a liquid, that is, to
        the gaseous particles leaping into the interstices between the
        particles of the liquid with a retardation of their motion (a
        partial liquefaction of the gas) and a bringing into harmony of
        the motion of both kinds of particles. The condensed gas
        absorbed at the surface of contact travels in all directions
        through the body, and diffuses from one layer to another until
        it entirely permeates it. The possibility of gaseous hydrogen
        acting thus is evident from the fact that even gold diffuses
        through solid lead under the same force. At length, at the
        opposite surface of the body penetrated, the condensed gas will
        find it possible to escape into greater freedom, and will
        continue to pass in this direction until its degree of
        concentration becomes the same on both sides. When this takes
        place it does not set up a sate of rest, but one of mobile
        equilibrium, that is, equal numbers of molecules or atoms will
        escape and leap in at both sides. If, as it must, ether has the
        faculty of permeating all substances, it must be even lighter
        and more elastic (greater vis viva) than hydrogen, and, what is
        most important, must have less capacity than hydrogen to form
        chemical compounds with the bodies it permeates. Compounds are
        characterized by the fact that the diverse atoms in them form
        systems or molecules, in which the different elements are in
        compatible, harmonious motion. We must therefore suppose that
        such a state of harmonious motion of, for instance, hydrogen and
        palladium, is actually set up in those atoms of hydrogen which
        permeate the palladium, and that in so doing it forms with the
        palladium some compound (either Pd<sub>2</sub>H or another)
        which easily dissociates when heated. Hence it seems to me that
        the atoms of ether are so void of this faculty of forming
        compounds (which is already weak in hydrogen) that such
        compounds dissociate at all temperatures, and that therefore
        nothing beyond a certain condensation among the atoms of
        substances can be looked for in the ether. </p>
      <p>Eight years ago, it would have been most arbitrary to deny the
        existence, in the substance or atoms of ether, of the faculty of
        forming any compounds with their chemical elements, for in those
        days all the known elements were, directly or indirectly,
        capable of entering into mutual combination. But in 1894 Lord
        Rayleigh and Professor Ramsay discovered argon, and defined it
        as the most inactive element; this was followed by the discovery
        of helium, the existence of which Lockyer had predicted by its
        spectrum as a solar element, and subsequently by the separation
        of neon, krypton and xenon from air. None of these five new
        gases have yet given any definite compounds, although they
        clearly evince the faculty of solution, i.e., of forming
        definite, easily dissociated compounds. Thus we have now every
        right to say that the ether is unable to form any stable
        compounds with other chemical atoms, although it permeates all
        substances. </p>
      <p>Hence <i>the ether may be said to be a gas, like helium or
          argon, incapable of chemical combination</i>. This definition
        of the ether as a gas, signifies that it belongs to the category
        of the ordinary physical states of matter, gaseous, liquid or
        solid. It does not require the recognition of a peculiar fourth
        state beyond the human understanding (Crookes). All mystical,
        spiritual ideas about ether disappear. In calling ether a gas,
        we understand a ‘fluid’ in the widest sense; an elastic fluid
        having no cohesion between its parts. Furthermore, if ether be a
        gas, it has weight; this is undisputable, unless the whole
        essence of natural science, from the days of Galileo, Newton,
        and Lavoisier, be discarded for its sake. But since ether
        possesses so great a penetrative power that it passes through
        every envelope, it is, of course, impossible to experimentally
        determine its mass in a given amount o other substances, or the
        weight of a given volume of ether. We ought, therefore, not to
        speak of the imponderability of ether, but only of the
        impossibility of weighing it. </p>
      <p>The preceding remarks are in exact accordance with the
        generally accepted conception of ether. The only addition made
        is to ascribe to ether the properties of a gas, like argon and
        helium utterly incapable of entering into true chemical
        combination. This point lies at the basis of our investigation
        into the chemical nature of ether, and includes the following
        two fundamental propositions: (1), that the ether is the
        lightest (in this respect ultimate) gas, and is endowed with a
        high penetrating power, which signifies that its particles have,
        relatively to other gases, small weight and extremely high
        velocity, and (2), that ether is a simple body (element)
        incapable of entering into combination or reaction with other
        elements or compounds, although capable of penetrating their
        substance, just as helium, argon, and their analogues are
        soluble in water and other liquids. </p>
      <p>The argon group of gases and the periodic system o the elements
        have such a close bearing upon our further consideration of the
        chemical nature of ether that it behooves us to look at them
        more closely. </p>
      <p>When in 1869 I first showed the periodic dependence of the
        properties of the elements upon their atomic weights, no element
        incapable of forming definite compounds was known, nor was the
        existence of such an element even suspected. Therefore the
        periodic system was arranged by me in groups, series, and
        periods, starting with group I and series I, with hydrogen as
        the lightest and least dense of all the elements. It never
        occurred to me that hydrogen might be the starting point of a
        system of elements. Guided by this system, I was able to predict
        both the existence of several unknown elements and also their
        physical and chemical properties in a free and combined state.
        These elements, gallium, scandium, and germanium, were
        subsequently discovered by Lecoq de Boisbaudran, Nilson, and
        Winkler respectively. I made these predictions by following what
        is known in mathematics as a method of interpolation, that is,
        by finding intermediate points by means of two extreme points
        whose relative position is known. The fact of my predictions
        having proved true confirmed the periodic system of elements,
        which may now be considered as an absolute law. So long as the
        law remained unconfirmed, it was not possible to extrapolate
        (i.e., to determine points beyond the limits of the known) by
        its means, but now such a method may be followed, and I have
        ventured to do so in the following remarks on the ether, as an
        element lighter than hydrogen. My reason for doing this was
        determined by two considerations. In the first place, I think I
        have not many years for delay; and, in the second place, in
        recent years there has been much talk about the division of
        atoms into more minute electrons, and it seems to me that such
        ideas are not so much metaphysical as metachemical, proceeding
        form the absence of any definite notions upon the chemism of
        ether, and it is my desire to replace such vague ideas by a more
        real notion of the chemical nature of the ether. For until some
        one demonstrates either the actual transformation of ordinary
        matter into ether, or the reverse, or else the transformation of
        one element into another, I consider that any conception of the
        division of atoms is contrary to the scientific teaching of the
        present day; and that those phenomena in which a division of
        atoms is recognized would be better understood as a separation
        or emission of the generally recognized and all-permeating
        ether. In a word, it seems to me that the time has arrived to
        speak of the chemical nature of the ether, all the more so
        since, so far as I know, no one has spoken at all definitely on
        this subject. When I applied the periodic law to the analogs of
        boron, aluminum, and silicon, I was 33 years younger than now,
        and I was perfectly confident that sooner or later my prediction
        would be fulfilled. Now I see less clearly and my confidence is
        not so great. Then I risked nothing, now I do. This required
        some courage, which I acquired when I saw the phenomena of
        radioactivity. I the saw that I must not delay, that perhaps my
        imperfect thoughts might lead some one to a surer path than that
        which was opened to my enfeebled vision. </p>
      <p>First, I will treat of the position of helium, argon, and their
        analogs in the periodic system; then of the position of ether I
        this system; and conclude with some remarks on the probable
        properties of ether according to the position it occupies in the
        periodic system. </p>
      <p>When, in 1895, I first heard of argon and its great chemical
        inertness, I doubted the elementary nature of the gas, and
        thought it might be a polymeride of nitrogen, N<sub>3</sub>,
        just as ozone, O<sub>3</sub>, is a polymeride of oxygen, with
        the difference that, while ozone is formed from oxygen with the
        absorption of heat, argon might be regarded as nitrogen deprived
        of heat. In chemistry nitrogen was always regarded as the type
        of chemical inertness, i.e., of an element which enters into
        reaction with great difficulty, and if its atoms lost heat in
        becoming condensed by polymerization from N<sub>2</sub> to N<sub>3</sub>,
        it would form a still less active body; just as silica, which is
        formed from silicon and oxygen with the evolution of heat, is
        more inert than either of them separately. Berthelot
        subsequently published a similar view on the nature of argon,
        but I have now long discarded that and consider argon to be an
        independent element, as Ramsay held it to be from the very
        beginning. Many reasons induced me to adopt this view, and
        chiefly the facts that (1) the density of argon is certainly
        much below 21, namely about 19, that of H being 1, while the
        density of N<sub>3</sub> would be about 21, for the molecular
        density of N<sub>3</sub> = 14 x 3 = 42 and the density would be
        half this; (2) helium, discovered by Ramsay in 1895, has a
        density of about 2 referred to hydrogen, and exhibits the same
        chemical inactivity as argon, and in its case this inactivity
        can certainly not be due to a complexity of its molecule; (3) in
        their newly discovered neon, krypton, and xenon, Ramsay and
        Travers found a similar inactivity which, in these cases also,
        could not be explained by polymerization; (4) the independent
        nature of the separate spectra of these gases, and the
        invariability of these spectra under the influence of electric
        sparks, proved that they belong to a family of elementary gases
        different from all other elements, and (5) the graduation and
        definite character of the physical properties in dependence upon
        the density and atomic weight further confirm the fact of their
        being simple bodies, whose individuality, in the absence of
        chemical reactions, can only be affirmed from the constancy of
        their physical features. An instance of this is seen in the
        boiling points (at 760 mm) or temperatures at which the vapor
        pressures equal the atmospheric pressure and at which the liquid
        and gaseous phases are co-existent: </p>

      <p>In both cases the boiling point clearly rises with the atomic
        or molecular weight. When the elementary nature of the argon
        analogs and their characteristic chemical inactivity were once
        proved, it became essential that they should take their place in
        the periodic system of the elements; not in any of the known
        groups but in a special one of their own, for they exhibited
        new, hitherto unknown chemical properties, and the periodic
        system embraces in different groups those elements which are
        analogous in their fundamental chemical properties, although not
        in dependence upon these properties but upon their atomic
        weight, which apparently -- previous to the discovery of the
        periodic law -- stands in no direct relation to these
        properties. This was a critical test for the periodic law and
        the analogs of argon, but they both stood the test with perfect
        success; that is, the atomic weights, calculated from the
        observed densities, proved to be in perfect accordance with the
        periodic law. </p>
      <p>Although I assume that the reader is acquainted with the
        periodic law, yet it may be well to mention that if the elements
        be arranged in the order of their atomic weights it will be
        found that similar variations in their chemical properties
        repeat themselves periodically, and that the order of the
        faculty of the elements to combine with other elements also
        corresponds with the order of their atomic weights. This is seen
        in the following simple example. </p>
      <p>All the elements having an atomic weight of not less than 7 and
        not more than 85.5 fall into two series: </p>
      <p>Li = 7.0&nbsp; ~&nbsp; Be = 9.1&nbsp; ~&nbsp; B = 11.0&nbsp;
        ~&nbsp; C = 12.0&nbsp; ~&nbsp; N = 14.0&nbsp; ~&nbsp; O =
        16&nbsp; ~&nbsp; F = 19.0 ~ <br>
        Na = 23.0&nbsp; ~&nbsp; Mg = 24.3&nbsp; ~&nbsp; Al = 27.0&nbsp;
        ~&nbsp; Si = 28.4&nbsp; ~&nbsp; P = 31.0&nbsp; ~&nbsp; S =
        32.1&nbsp; ~&nbsp; Cl = 35.5 </p>
      <p>Each pair of elements present a great similarity in their chief
        properties; this is especially marked in the higher saline
        oxides, which in the lower series are: </p>
      <p>Na<sub>2</sub>O ~ MgO ~ Al<sub>2</sub>O3 ~ SiO<sub>2</sub> ~ P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>
        ~ SO<sub>3</sub> ~ Cl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>, or <br>
        Na<sub>2</sub>O, Mg<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>,
        Si<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>6</sub>,
        Cl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>. </p>
      <p>Thus the atomic order of the elements exactly corresponds to
        the arithmetical order from 1 to 7. So that the groups of the
        analogous elements may be designated by the Roman ciphers I to
        VII: and when it is said that phosphorus belongs to Group V, it
        signifies that it forms a higher saline oxide P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>.
        And if the analogs of argon do not form any compounds of any
        kind, it is evident that they cannot be included in any of the
        groups of the previously known elements, but should form a
        special zero group which at once expresses the fact of their
        chemical indifference. Moreover, their atomic weight should
        necessarily be less than those of group I: Li, Na, K, Rd, and
        Cs, but greater than those of the halogens, F, Cl, Br and I, and
        this a priori conclusion was subsequently confirmed by fact,
        thus: </p>

      <p>The five well-known alkali metals correspond to the newly
        discovered argon analogs, and the atomic weights of both exhibit
        the same common law of periodicity. But the halogens and alkali
        metals are the most chemically active among the elements, and
        are, moreover, of opposite chemical nature, the first being
        particularly prone to react with metals and the others with
        metalloids, the former appearing at the anode and the latter at
        the cathode. They must therefore stand at the two extremes of
        the periodic system, as in the scheme in <b>Figure 1</b>. </p>

      <p>Here <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> stand for two unknown elements
        having atomic weights less than that of hydrogen, whose
        discovery I now look for. </p>
      <p>A reference to the above remarks on the argon group of elements
        shows first of all that such a zero group as they correspond to
        could not possibly have been foreseen under the conditions of
        chemical knowledge at the time of the discovery of the periodic
        law in 1869; and, although I had a vague notion that hydrogen
        might be preceded by some elements of less atomic weight, I
        dared not put forward such a proposal, because it was purely
        conjectural, and I feared to injure the first impression of the
        periodic law by its introduction. Moreover, in those days the
        question of the ether did not awaken much interest, for
        electrical phenomena were not then ascribed to its agency, and
        it is this that now gives such importance to the ether. But at
        the present time, when there can be no doubt that the hydrogen
        group is preceded by the zero group composed of elements of less
        atomic weights, it seems to me impossible to deny the existence
        of elements lighter than hydrogen. </p>
      <p>Let us first consider the element in the first series of the
        zero group. It is designated by <i>y</i>. It will evidently
        exhibit all the fundamental properties of the argon gases. But
        first we must have an approximate idea of its atomic weight. To
        do this, let us consider the ratio of the atomic weights of two
        elements belonging to the same group in the neighboring series.
        Starting with Ce = 140 and Sn = 119 (here the ratio is 1.18),
        this ratio, in passing to the lower groups and series, increases
        constantly and fairly uniformly as the atomic weights of the
        elements under comparison decrease. But we will limit our
        calculation to the first and second series, starting with Cl =
        85.45; for (1) we are exclusively concerned wit the lightest
        elements, (2) the ratio of the atomic weights is more accurate
        for these elements, and (3) the small periods of the typical
        elements (which should include the elements lighter than
        hydrogen) terminate with chlorine. As the atomic weight of
        chlorine is 35.45 and that of fluorine 19.0, the ratio Cl:F =
        35.4:19.0 = 1.86; so also we find: </p>
      <p>Group <br>
        VII&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cl:F = 1.86 <br>
        VI&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; S:O = 2.00 <br>
        V&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; P:N = 2.21 <br>
        IV&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Si:C = 2.37 <br>
        III&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Al:B = 2.45 <br>
        II&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mg:Be = 2.67 <br>
        I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Na:Li = 3.28 <br>
        0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ne:He = 4.98 </p>
      <p>This proves that the ratio in the given series distinctly and
        progressively increases in passing from the higher to the lower
        groups; and, moreover, that it varies most rapidly between the
        first and zero groups. It follows therefore that the ratio He:<i>y</i>
        will be considerably greater than the ratio Li:H which is 6.97,
        so that the ratio He:<i>y</i> will be at least 10 and probably
        even greater. Hence, as the atomic ratio He = 4.0, the atomic
        weight of <i>y</i> will not be greater than 4.0/10 = 0.4 and
        probably less. Such an analog of helium may perhaps be founding
        coronium, whose spectrum, clearly visible in the solar corona
        above (that is, further from the sun than) that of hydrogen, is
        simple like that of helium, which seems to indicate that it
        belongs to a gas resembling helium, which was also predicted
        from its spectrum by Lockyer. Young and Harkness independently
        observed the spectrum of this unknown element during the solar
        eclipse of 1869. It is characterized by a bright-green line at
        531.7 uu, while helium is characterized by a yellow line, 587
        uu. Nasini, Anderlini, and Salvadori think that they discovered
        traces of coronium in their observations on the spectra of
        volcanic gases (1893). And as the lines of coronium were also
        observed, even at distances many times the radius of the sun
        above its atmosphere and protuberances, where the hydrogen lines
        are no longer visible, it is evident that coronium should have
        less density and atomic weight than hydrogen. Moreover, as the
        ratio of the specific heats (at a constant pressure and for a
        constant volume) of helium, argon, and their analogs gives
        reason for thinking that their molecules (i.e., the amount of
        matter occupying, according to Avogadro-Gerhardt’s law, a volume
        equal to the volume of two parts by weight of hydrogen) contain
        only one atom&nbsp; (like mercury, cadmium and most metals), it
        follows that, if 0.4 be the greatest atomic weight of the
        element <i>y</i>, its density referred to hydrogen should be
        less than 0.2. Consequently the molecules of this gas will,
        according to the kinetic theory of gases, move 2.24 times faster
        than those of hydrogen, and if, as Stoney (1894-1898) and
        Rostovsky (1899) endeavor to prove, the progressive motion of
        the molecules of hydrogen and helium be such that they can leap
        out of the sphere of earth’s attraction, then a gas whose
        density is at least five times less than that of hydrogen could
        certainly only exist in the atmosphere of a body having as great
        a mass as the sun. However, this <i>y</i>-coronium or some
        other gas with a density of about 0.2 cannot possibly be ether,
        its density being too great. It wanders, perhaps for ages, in
        the regions of space, breaks from the shackles of the earth and
        again comes within its sphere, but still it cannot escape from
        the regions of the sun’s attraction, and there are many heavenly
        bodies of greater mass than the sun. But the atoms of ether must
        be of another kind; they must be capable of overcoming even the
        sun’s attraction, of freely permeating all space, and of
        penetrating everything and everywhere. The element <i>y</i>,
        however, is necessary for us to be able to mentally realize the
        lightest and therefore swiftest element, <i>x</i>, which I
        consider may be looked upon as the ether. </p>
      <p>We have seen that, besides the ordinary groups of the
        chemically active elements, a zero group of chemically inactive
        elements must now be recognized for helium, argon, and their
        analogs. Thanks to Ramsay’s exemplary researches, these elements
        are now tangible realities, authentic gases foreign to chemical
        association, that is, distinguished by their specific property
        of not being chemically attracted to each other or to other
        atoms even at infinitely small distances, and yet having weight,
        that is, subject to the law of attraction of mechanics, which
        has nothing in common with chemical attraction. There is some
        hope that gravity may in some way or another be explained by
        means of pressure or impact acting from all sides, but chemical
        attraction, which only acts at infinitely small distances, will
        long remain an incomprehensible problem. The problem of the
        ether is more or less closely connected with that of gravity,
        and gains in simplicity when all question of the chemical
        attraction of the atoms of ether is excluded, and this is
        accomplished by placing it in the zero group. But if the series
        of elements begins with series I containing hydrogen, the zero
        group has no place for an element lighter than <i>y</i>, like
        ether. I therefore add a zero series, besides a zero group, to
        the periodic system, and place the element <i>x</i> in this
        zero series, regarding it (1) as the lightest of all the
        elements both in density and atomic weight; (2) as the most
        mobile gas; (3) as the element least prone to enter into
        combination with other atoms, and (4) as an all-permeating and
        penetrating substance. Of course, this is a hypothesis, but it
        is not one constructed for purely ‘working’ ends, but simply
        from a desire to extend the real periodic system of the known
        elements to the confines or limits of the lowest dimensions of
        atoms, which I cannot and will not regard in the light of simple
        nullity called mass. </p>
      <p>Being unable to conceive the formation of the known elements
        from hydrogen, I can neither regard them as being formed from
        the element <i>x</i>, although it is the lightest of all the
        elements. I cannot admit this, not only because no fact points
        to the possibility of the transformation of one element into
        another, but chiefly because I do not see that such an admission
        would in any way facilitate or simplify our understanding of the
        substances and phenomena of nature. And when I am told that the
        doctrine of unity in the material of which the elements are
        built up responds to an aspiration for unity in all things, I
        can only reply that at the root of all things a distinction must
        be made between matter, force, and mind; that it is simpler to
        admit the germs of individuality in the material elements than
        elsewhere, and that no general relation is possible between
        things unless they have some individual character resident in
        them. In a word, I see no object in following the doctrine of
        unity of matter, while I clearly see the necessity of
        recognizing the unity of the substance of ether and of realizing
        a conception of it, as the uttermost limit of that process by
        which all the other atoms of the elements were formed and by
        which all substances were formed from these atoms. To me this
        kind of unity is far more real than any conception of the
        formation of the elements from a single primary matter. Neither
        gravity nor any of the problems of energy can be rightly
        understood without a real conception of the ether as a universal
        medium transmitting energy at a distance. Moreover, a real
        conception of ether cannot be obtained without recognizing its
        chemical nature as an elementary substance, and in these days no
        elementary substance is conceivable which is not subject to the
        periodic law. </p>
      <p>I will therefore, in conclusion, endeavor to show what
        consequences should follow from the above conception of the
        ether, from an experimental or realistic point of view, even
        should it never be possible to isolate or combine or in any way
        grasp this substance. </p>
      <p>Although it was possible to approximately determine the atomic
        weight of the element <i>y</i> on the basis of that of helium,
        this cannot be repeated for the element <i>x</i>, because it
        lies at the frontier or limit, about the zero point of the
        atomic weights. Moreover, the analogs of helium cannot serve as
        a basis owing to the uncertainty of their numerical data.
        However, if the ratio of the atomic weights be Xe:Kr = 1.56:1;
        Kr:Ar = 2.15:1, and Ar:He = 9.5:1, we find that He:<i>x</i> =
        23.1:1, or if He = 4.9, that the atomic weight of <i>x</i> =
        0.17. This must be considered the maximum possible value. Most
        probably the atomic weight of <i>x</i> is far less, for the
        following reasons. If the gas in question be an analog of
        helium, its molecule will contain one atom, and therefore its
        density, referred to that of hydrogen, must be about half its
        atomic weight or <i>x</i>/2, where <i>x</i> is the atomic
        weight. In order to be able to permeate throughout all space,
        its density must be so small, compared with that of hydrogen,
        that its molecular motion would allow it to overcome the
        attraction, not only of the earth and sun, but also of all the
        stars, as otherwise it would accumulate about the largest mass
        and not fill all space. The velocity of the molecular motion is
        determined by the number of impinging particles and their <i>vis







          viva</i> is calculated according to the kinetic theory of
        gases, by an expression containing a constant divided by the
        square root of the density of the gas and multiplied by the
        square root of (1 + <i>at</i>), which expresses the expansion
        of the gas by heat. In the case of hydrogen (density = 1) at <i>t</i>
        = 0°, the mean velocity of the particles, calculated on the
        basis that a liter of hydrogen at 0° and 760 mm weighs bout 0.09
        grams, is 1843 meters/second, that of oxygen being 461 meters,
        for its density is 16 times that of hydrogen, i.e., <i>v</i> =
        1843 / 4 = 461. Thus the velocity increases as the density
        becomes less and as the temperature becomes greater, but does
        not depend upon the number of molecules in a given volume; and
        if our gas have an atomic weight <i>x</i> and density (referred
        to hydrogen) <i>x</i>/2, then the velocity of its molecules
        will be: </p>
      <p>(I)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>v</i> = 1843 x sq. rt. 2(1 + <i>at</i>)/<i>x</i>
      </p>
      <p>In this expression<i> x</i> is the unknown quantity, to find
        which we must know <i>t</i> and <i>v</i>, or the velocity
        required by the particles to escape from the sphere of the
        earth’s sun’s and stars’ attraction, like the projectile in
        Jules Verne’s ‘Voyage to the Moon’. </p>
      <p>As regards the temperature of space, this can only be regarded
        as the absolute zero by those who deny the material nature of
        the ether, for temperature in a perfect vacuum or I space devoid
        of matter is an absurdity, and a solid such as an aerolite or
        thermometer introduced into such space would alter the
        temperature, not by contact with the surrounding medium, but
        solely by radiation. But if space be filled with the substance
        of ether, it not only may have, but must, have its own
        temperature, which evidently cannot be absolute zero. Many
        methods have been tried to determine this temperature, but it is
        unnecessary to discuss them here. Suffice it to say that no one
        has found it less than -150° or above -40°; as a rule, the
        limits are taken as -100° and -60°. It is hopeless to expect any
        definite or exact data on this subject, and probably the
        temperature varies in different localities owing to radiation
        being different in different parts of space. Moreover, the value
        of <i>t</i> between -100° and -60° has hardly any significance
        in an approximate evaluation of <i>x</i>, as only the maximum
        value of <i>x</i> can be calculated by the expression (1); for
        there can be no question of any exact value, all that is
        required being to obtain an idea of the order in which <i>x</i>
        stands among the elements. We therefore take <i>t</i> = -80;
        then if <i>a</i> = 0.000367, </p>
      <p>(II)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>v</i> = 2191 / sq. rt. <i>x</i>,
        or <i>x</i> = 4800000/<i>v</i><sup>2</sup> </p>
      <p>where <i>x</i> is the atomic weight of the gaseous element
        required, referred to hydrogen, and <i>v</i> the velocity of
        motion of its particles at -80° in meters/second. </p>
      <p>This velocity must now be determined. We know that a body
        thrown up in the air falls back to earth, and in doing so
        describes a parabola. The height of its flight increases as its
        initial velocity is made greater, and it is evident that this
        velocity might be such that the body would pass beyond the
        sphere of the earth’s attraction, and fall on some other
        heavenly body, or rotate about the earth as a satellite by
        virtue of the laws of gravitation. It has been calculated that
        to do this the velocity of the body must exceed the square root
        of double the mass of the attracting body divided by the
        distance from its center of gravity to the point at which the
        velocity is determined. The mass of the earth is calculated in
        absolute units from the mean radius of the earth ( = 6,373,000
        meters) and the mean attraction of gravity at the surface of the
        earth ( = 9.807 meters), for the attraction of gravity is equal
        to the mass divided by the square of the distance (in this
        instance, the square of the earth’s radius), and therefore the
        mass of the earth -- 398.1012, and the velocity sought for must
        therefore exceed 1,190 meters /second. Hence, according to
        Formula II, the atomic weight of such a gas must be less than
        0.038 to enable it to escape freely from the earth’s atmosphere
        into space. All gases of greater atomic weight, not only
        hydrogen and helium, but even the gas <i>y</i> (coronium?),
        will remain in the earth’s atmosphere. </p>
      <p>The mass of the sun is approximately 325,000, if that of the
        earth is taken as unity. Hence the absolute magnitude of the
        sun’s mass will be nearly 129.1018. The radius of the sun is
        109.5 times greater than that of the earth, i.e., nearly
        698.1016 meters. Hence only bodies or particles having a
        velocity of about 608,300 meters/second could escape from the
        surface of the sun. According to formula II, the atomic weight
        of a gas <i>x</i> having such a velocity will not be half this
        figure. Hence the atomic weight and density of such a gas which,
        like the ether, permeates space, must at all events be less than
        this figure. This is inevitable because there are stars of
        greater mass than the sun. This has been proved by researches
        made on double stars. </p>
      <p>The most exact data we now possess concern Sirius, whose total
        mass (including that of its satellites) is 3.24 times that of
        the sun. To determine this, it was necessary to investigate not
        only the relative motion of both stars, but also the parallax of
        this system. In the case of Sirius it was possible to determine
        the ratio of the masses of the two stars. This was found to be
        2.05, so that the mass of one star is 2.20, and that of the
        other 1.04 times that of the sun. In the following cases, only
        the total mass of the two twin stars was determined relative to
        that of the sun: </p>
      <p>a-Centauri = 2.0 <br>
        70-Opiuchi = 1.6 <br>
        u-Cassiopeiae = 0.52 <br>
        61-Cygni = 0.34 <br>
        g-Leonus = 5.8 <br>
        g-Virginis = 32.7 </p>
      <p>The mass of B-Persei with its satellites is 0.67 times that of
        the sun, that of the star being twice that of its satellite. The
        triple star 40-Eridium has a mass 1.1 times that of the sun, the
        mass of the brightest star being 2.37 times that of the other
        two. </p>
      <p>It appears, therefore, that although there are some stars which
        are greater, and some which are less, still the mass of the sun
        is nearly the average of that of the other stars. For our
        purpose we need only consider the stars of much greater mass
        than the sun. That of the double star g-Virginis has a common
        mass about 33 times that of the sun. There is no reason for
        thinking that this is the maximum, and it will therefore be
        safer to infer that there may be stars whose mass exceed 50
        times that of the sun, but I do not think it likely that a
        larger mass than this is in the nature of things. To complete
        our calculation it is also necessary to know the radius of the
        stars, about which we have no direct data. However, the
        composition and temperature of the stars may give a clue.
        Spectrum analysis proves that the terrestrial chemical elements
        occur in the most distant heavenly bodies, and from analogy
        there seems no doubt that the general mass composition of these
        bodies is very similar in all cases; that is to say, that they
        are composed of a dense core surrounded by a less dense crust
        and an atmosphere which becomes gradually rarefied. Thus the
        composition of the stars probably differs but little from that
        of the sun. Only at the core can the density differ much from
        that of the sun, but this cannot greatly affect the average
        density. Neither can the temperature of the stars differ greatly
        from that of the sun. Moreover, a rise of temperature would tend
        to increase the diameter of the star, and this would decrease
        the value of the velocity required by the gaseous particles to
        escape from the sphere of attraction. It appears, therefore,
        that for the purposes of our calculation the average density of
        the large stars may be taken as nearly that of the sun, and
        therefore that the radius of a star whose mass is <i>n</i>
        times that of the sun will be <sup>3</sup>sq. rt. <i>n</i>
        times the radius of the sun. We now have all the data necessary
        for calculating the velocity required by gaseous particles to
        escape from the sphere of attraction of a star 50 times greater
        than the sun. </p>
      <p>Its mass is 50.129.10<sup>18</sup> or nearly 65.10<sup>29</sup>,
        and its radius nearly 698.10<sup>6.3</sup> sq. rt. of 50, or
        26.10<sup>8</sup>. Hence the velocity required will be nearly
        2,240,000 meters/second, or 2,240 kilometers/second. </p>
      <p>The great magnitude of this velocity, <i>v</i>, and its
        proximity to that of light (300,000,000 meters/second) provoke
        the following inquiry. How much must the mass of a heavenly body
        exceed that of the sun to retain on its surface particles
        endowed with a velocity of 3.10<sup>3</sup> meters/second, if
        its mean density were equal to that of the sun? This may be
        calculated from the fact that if the mean density of the two
        luminaries be equal, the velocities of bodies able to escape
        into space from the spheres of attraction will stand in the
        ration of the cube roots of their masses, and therefore a
        luminary from whose surface particles endowed with a velocity of
        300,00,000 meters/second could escape must have a mass
        120,000,000 times that of the sun, for only particles having a
        velocity of 608,000 meters/second can escape from the sun, and
        this stands to 300,000,000 in the ratio of 1:493, and the cube
        of 493 is nearly 120,000,000. </p>
      <p>But, so far we have no reason for admitting the existence of
        such a huge body, and therefore it seems to me that the velocity
        of the particles of our gas (ether) must, in order to permeate
        space, be greater than 2,240,000 meters/second and probably less
        that 300,000,000 meters /second. </p>
      <p>Hence the atomic weight of <i>x</i> as the lightest elementary
        gas, permeating space and performing the part of the ether, must
        be within the limits (formula II) of 0.000,000,96 and
        0.000,000,000,053, if that of H = 1. </p>
      <p>I think it is impossible, under the present conditions of our
        scientific knowledge, to admit the latter value, because it
        would in some measure answer to a revival of the emission theory
        of light, and I consider that the majority of phenomena are
        sufficiently explained by the fact that <i>the particles and
          atoms of the lightest element x capable of moving freely
          everywhere throughout the universe have an atomic weight
          nearly one millionth that of hydrogen, and travel with a
          velocity of about 2,250 kilometers/second.</i> </p>
      <p>When I was making these calculations, my friend Professor Dewar
        sent me his presidential address to the Belfast meeting of the
        British Association. In it he expresses the thought that the
        highest regions of the atmosphere, which are the seat of the
        aurora borealis, must be considered to be the province of
        hydrogen and of the argon analogs. This is only a few steps from
        the yet more distant regions of space and from the necessity of
        recognizing the existence of a still lighter gas capable of
        permeating and filling space and thus giving a tangible reality
        to the conception of the ether. </p>
      <p>In conceiving the ether as a gas endowed with the above
        properties, and belonging to the zero group of elements, I
        desired before all to extract from the periodic law that which
        it was able to give and to tangibly explain the materiality and
        universal presence of an ethereal substance throughout nature,
        and also to explain its faculty of permeating all substances,
        gaseous, liquid and solid. The atoms of even the lighter
        elements forming the ordinary substances being several million
        times heavier than those of ether, they are not likely to be
        greatly influenced in their mutual relations by its presence. </p>
      <p>Of course there are still many problems to be solved, but I
        think the majority are unfathomable, and I have no intention of
        raising them here or of trying to solve those which appear
        capable of being solved. My only purpose has been to state my
        opinion on a subject about which I know many are thinking and
        some are beginning to speak. </p>
      <p>Without going into a further development of our subject, I
        should like to acquaint the reader with some, at first sight,
        auxiliary circumstances which guided my thoughts and led me to
        publish my opinions. These consist of a series of recently
        discovered physico-chemical phenomena which are not subject to
        the ordinary doctrines of science, and have cause many to return
        to the emission theory of light, or to accept the, to me, vague
        hypothesis of electrons, without trying to explain to the utmost
        the familiar concept of an ethereal medium transmitting luminous
        vibrations, &amp;c. This more especially refers to radioactive
        phenomena. </p>
      <p>I need not describe there most remarkable phenomena, assuming
        that the reader is more or less acquainted with them; and will
        only mention that a perusal of the literature of the subject,
        and what I saw in M. Becquerel’s laboratory and heard from him
        and Monsieur and Madame Curie, gave me the impression of some
        peculiar state proper chiefly (but not exclusively, just as
        magnetism is chiefly, but not exclusively, the property of iron
        and cobalt) to uranium and the thorium compounds. </p>
      <p>As uranium and thorium, and also radium, judging from Madame
        Curie’s researches (1902), have the highest atomic weights
        (U=239, Th = 232, and Rd = 224) among the elements, they may be
        looked upon as suns, endowed with the highest degree of that
        individualized attractive capacity, a mean between gravity and
        chemical affinity, which is seen in the absorption of gases,
        solution, &amp;c. By conceiving the substance of the ether as
        the lightest of gases,<i> x</i>, deprived, like helium and
        argon, of the power to form stable definite compounds, it need
        not be imagined that this gas is deprived of the faculty of, as
        it were, dissolving in or accumulating about large centers of
        attraction like the sun among heavenly bodies, or uranium and
        thorium in the world of atoms. As a matter of fact, direct
        experiment proves that helium and argon are able to dissolve in
        liquids, and, moreover, to individualize this faculty according
        to either their own nature or that of the liquid and according
        to the temperature. If the ether is a gas, <i>x</i>, it must
        naturally accumulate from all parts of the universe towards the
        medium or mass of the sun, just as the gases of the atmosphere
        accumulate in a drop of water. And the lightest of gases, <i>x</i>,
        will also accumulate about the heaviest atoms of uranium and
        thorium, and perhaps change its form of motion like a gas
        dissolved in a liquid. This will not be a definite act of
        combination, determined by a conformable harmonious motion, like
        the motion of a planet and its satellites, but an embryo of such
        a motion, resembling that of a comet in the region of heavenly
        individualizations, and it may be looked for sooner in the
        region of the heaviest atoms of uranium and thorium than in
        those of the lighter elements, just as a comet falling from
        space into the planetary system revolves round the sun and then
        once more escapes into space. If such a special accumulation of
        ether atoms about the molecules of uranium and thorium be
        admissible, they might be expected to exhibit peculiar
        phenomena, determined by the emission of a portion of this ether
        held by particles of normal mean velocity and by new ether
        entering into the sphere of attraction. It seems to me that the
        optical and photo-radiant phenomena, not to mention the loss of
        electrical charges, indicate a material flow of something which
        has not been weighed, and it appears to me that they might be
        understood in this manner, for peculiar forms of the entrance
        and egress of ether atoms should be accompanied by such
        disturbances in the ethereal medium as give the phenomena of
        light. Monsieur and Madame Curie showed me the following
        experiment, for instance. Two small flasks were connected
        together by a lateral tube fused into their necks, and having a
        stopcock in the middle. The cock being closed, a solution of the
        radioactive substance was poured into one of the flasks, while
        the gelatinous white precipitate of sulfide of zinc, shaken up
        in water, was placed in the other flask. Then both flasks were
        closed. So long as the cock between the flasks remained closed,
        nothing is visible in the dark; but directly as it is opened,
        the sulfide of zinc becomes brilliantly fluorescent and
        continues so as long as the tube connecting the flasks remains
        open. This experiment gives the impression of an emissive flow
        of something material from the radioactive substance, and, in a
        sense, seems comprehensible if we assume that a peculiar refined
        ether gas, capable of exciting luminous vibrations, enters and
        passes off from the radioactive substance. Just as any kind of
        motion may be set up in a gas, not only by a solid piston, but
        also by the motion of another portion of the same gas, so also
        the phenomenon of light, i.e., a certain transverse vibration of
        the ether, may be produced not only by the molecular motion of
        particles of other bodies (by heating them or otherwise)
        bringing the ether from its state of mobile equilibrium, but
        also by a certain change in the motion of the ether atoms
        themselves; i.e., by their destroying their own equilibrium
        which may be caused in the case of radioactive bodies by the
        massiveness of the atoms of uranium and thorium, just as the
        luminosity of the sun may be, I think, due to its great mass
        being able to accumulate ether in far larger quantities than the
        planets, &amp;c. I think that the radio-luminous phenomena,
        i.e., such as proceed at right angles to the ray of the
        vibration of the ether medium, consisting of minute atoms in
        rapid motion, are, as a matter of fact, more complex than has
        hitherto been thought, chiefly owing to the fact that the
        velocity of the ether atoms is not very much less (180 times)
        than that f the propagation of their transverse vibrations. This
        at all events was the impression I acquired from the radioactive
        phenomena I saw, and I do not conceal it, although I consider it
        very difficult to form any opinion on this still dim province of
        the phenomena of light. </p>
      <p>In conclusion, I may mention another class of phenomena, which
        led me to this conception of the ether. Dewar, about 1894, in
        his researches on the phenomena proceeding at low temperatures,
        observed that the phosphorescence of many substances, and
        especially of paraffin, becomes more intense at the temperature
        of liquid air (between -181° and -193°). Now, it appears to me
        that this is due to the fact that paraffin and such like
        substances have a great capacity for condensing the atoms of
        ether at very low temperatures. In other words, that the
        solubility (absorption) of the ether atoms in some bodies
        increases in extreme cold. They therefore become more
        phosphorescent, for the vibrations of light are then set up in
        the phosphorescent substances, not only by their own atoms
        (having the property of illumination at their surface, of
        passing into a state of peculiar tension, which causes, when the
        act of illumination ceases, the ether to vibrate), but also by
        the atoms of ether which condense in these bodies and set up a
        rapid state of interchange with the surrounding medium. </p>
      <p>It seems to me that this conception of ether, as a peculiar
        all-permeating gas, gives a means, if not of analyzing such
        phenomena, at all events of understanding their possibility. I
        do not regard my imperfect endeavor to explain the nature of
        ether from a chemical point of view as more than the expression
        of a series of thoughts which have arisen in my mind, and which
        I have given vent to solely from a desire that these thoughts,
        being suggested by facts, should not be utterly lost. Most
        probably similar thoughts have come to many, but unless they are
        enunciated they often pass away without being further developed.
        If they contain a particle of that natural truth which we all
        seek, my effort will not have been in vain; it may then be
        worked out, embodied and corrected, and if my conception be
        proved false in its basis, it will prevent others from repeating
        it. I know of no other way for slow and steady progress. And
        even if it be found impossible to recognize in the ether the
        properties of the lightest, most mobile, and chemically inactive
        gas, still, if we keep to the realm of science, we cannot deny
        its substantiality, and this requires a search for its chemical
        nature. My effort is no more than a tentative answer to this
        primary question, and its one objective is to bring this
        question to the fore. </p>
