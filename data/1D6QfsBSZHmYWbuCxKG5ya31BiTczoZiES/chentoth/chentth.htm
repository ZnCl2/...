        <p><b><font size="+1">Smile! A New Canadian Tool Can Regrow
              Teeth Say Inventors</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>Snaggle-toothed hockey players and sugar lovers may soon
        rejoice as Canadian scientists said they have created the first
        device able to re-grow teeth and bones. </p>
      <p>The researchers at the University of Alberta in Edmonton filed
        patents earlier this month in the United States for the tool
        based on low-intensity pulsed ultrasound technology after
        testing it on a dozen dental patients in Canada. </p>
      <p>"Right now, we plan to use it to fix fractured or diseased
        teeth, as well as asymmetric jawbones, but it may also help
        hockey players or children who had their tooth knocked out," Jie
        Chen, an engineering professor and nano-circuit design expert,
        told AFP. </p>
      <p>Chen helped create the tiny ultrasound machine that gently
        massages gums and stimulates tooth growth from the root once
        inserted into a person's mouth, mounted on braces or a removable
        plastic crown. </p>
      <p>The wireless device, smaller than a pea, must be activated for
        20 minutes each day for four months to stimulate growth, he
        said. </p>
      <p>It can also stimulate jawbone growth to fix a person's crooked
        smile and may eventually allow people to grow taller by
        stimulating bone growth, Chen said. </p>
      <p>Tarek El-Bialy, a new member of the university's dentistry
        faculty, first tested the low-intensity pulsed ultrasound
        treatment to repair dental tissue in rabbits in the late 1990s.
      </p>
      <p>His research was published in the <i>American Journal of
          Orthodontics and Dentofacial Orthopedics</i> and later
        presented at the World Federation of Orthodontics in Paris in
        September 2005. </p>
      <p>With the help of Chen and Ying Tsui, another engineering
        professor, the initial massive handheld device was shrunk to fit
        inside a person's mouth. </p>
      <p>It is still at the prototype stage, but the trio expects to
        commercialize it within two years, Chen said. </p>
      <p>The bigger version has already received approvals from American
        and Canadian regulatory bodies, he noted. </p>

      <p>Congratulations to Dr. Tarek El-Bialy and his team Dr. Jie Chen
        and Dr. Ying Tsui (from the Electrical Engineering department)
        who has recently been awarded with the NSERC (121) [Idea to
        Innovation] grant for "Intraoral Wireless Device for Dental
        Tissue Formation and Tooth-Root Healing". </p>
      <p>Moreover, Dr. Tarek El-Bialy has discovered that this
        ultrasound can stimulate lower jaw growth especially in patients
        with craniofacial problems like Hemifacial Microsomia. Usually
        these patients have to undergo many surgeries during their
        lives. This new device will be expected to improve many unsolved
        problems in Dentistry and Craniofacial areas. A provisional
        patent has been filed based on this research as well as the
        awarded grant.&nbsp; More details about this research can be
        found at the following website http://myprofile.cos.com/telbialy
      </p>
      <p>For the second time in UA history, our research team has
        awarded an NSERC (I2I)[Idea to Innovation] grant to miniaturize
        a small ultrasound device for stimulating teeth healing and
        dental tissue formation. This team includes in addition to Dr.
        Tarek El-Bialy&nbsp; (in the Orthodontic Graduate program and
        Biomedical Engineering), Drs. Jie Chen and Ying Tsui from the
        Electrical Engineering department. When it was published by Dr.
        Tarek El-Bialy at the American Journal of Orthodontics for the
        first time in History that new dental tissue can be reformed
        after the teeth are grown, this research team and patent was
        planned for. </p>

        <p><b><font size="+1">Ultrasound may help regrow teeth</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>Hockey players, rejoice! A team of University of Alberta
        researchers has created technology to regrow teeth--the first
        time scientists have been able to reform human dental tissue. </p>
      <p>Using low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS), Dr. Tarak
        El-Bialy from the Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry and Dr. Jie
        Chen and Dr. Ying Tsui from the Faculty of Engineering have
        created a miniaturized system-on-a-chip that offers a
        non-invasive and novel way to stimulate jaw growth and dental
        tissue healing. </p>
      <p>"It's very exciting because we have shown the results and
        actually have something you can touch and feel that will impact
        the health of people in Canada and throughout the world," said
        Chen, who works out of the Department of Electrical and Computer
        Engineering and the National Institute for Nanotechnology. </p>
      <p>The wireless design of the ultrasound transducer means the
        miniscule device will be able to fit comfortably inside a
        patient's mouth while packed in biocompatible materials. The
        unit will be easily mounted on an orthodontic or "braces"
        bracket or even a plastic removable crown. The team also
        designed an energy sensor that will ensure the LIPUS power is
        reaching the target area of the teeth roots within the bone. TEC
        Edmonton, the U of A's exclusive tech transfer service provider,
        filed the first patent recently in the U.S. Currently, the
        research team is finishing the system-on-a-chip and hopes to
        complete the miniaturized device by next year. </p>
      <p>"If the root is broken, it can now be fixed," said El-Bialy.
        "And because we can regrow the teeth root, a patient could have
        his own tooth rather than foreign objects in his mouth." </p>
      <p>The device is aimed at those experiencing dental root
        resorption, a common effect of mechanical or chemical injury to
        dental tissue caused by diseases and endocrine disturbances.
        Mechanical injury from wearing orthodontic braces causes
        progressive root resorption, limiting the duration that braces
        can be worn. This new device will work to counteract the
        destructive resorptive process while allowing for the continued
        wearing of corrective braces. With approximately five million
        people in North America presently wearing orthodontic braces,
        the market size for the device would be 1.4 million users. </p>
      <p>In a true tale of interdisciplinary work, El-Bialy met Chen at
        the U of A's new staff orientation. After hearing about Chen's
        expertise in nanoscale circuit design and nano-biotechnology,
        El-Bialy explained his own research and asked if Chen might be
        able to help produce a tiny ultrasound device to fit in a
        patient's mouth. The two collaborated and eventually along with
        Tsui received a grant from NSERC's "Idea to Innovation," program
        to expand on their prototype. </p>
      <p>Dr. El-Bialy first discovered new dental tissue was being
        formed after using ultrasound on rabbits. In one study,
        published in the <i>American Journal of Orthodontics and
          Dentofacial Orthopedics</i>, El Bialy used ultrasound on one
        rabbit incisor and left the other incisor alone. After seeing
        the surprising positive results, he moved onto humans and found
        similar results. He has also shown that LIPUS can improve jaw
        growth in cases with hemifacial microsomia, a congenital
        syndrome where one side of the child's jaw or face is
        underdeveloped compared to the other, normal, side. These
        patients usually undergo many surgeries to improve their facial
        appearance. This work on human patients was presented at the
        World Federation of Orthodontics in Paris, September 2005. </p>
      <p>"After proving it worked, we looked at creating a smaller
        ultrasound carrier where we can take the patient out as a
        variable," said El-Bialy. "Before this, a patient has to hold
        the ultrasound for 20 minutes a day for a year and that is a lot
        to ask." </p>
      <p>The researchers are currently working on turning their
        prototype into a market-ready model and expect the device to be
        ready for the public within next two years. </p>

      <p>A tiny ultrasound device could help people regrow teeth,
        researchers at the University of Alberta say. </p>
      <p>The prototype device offers a way to reform human dental tissue
        for the first time, the team said Wednesday. </p>
      <p>Everyone from hockey players to children who knock out a tooth
        could benefit. </p>
      <p>The treatment, called low-intensity pulsed ultrasound, massages
        the gums to stimulate jaws, encourage growth in the roots of
        teeth and aid healing in dental tissue. </p>
      <p>"If the root is broken, it can now be fixed," said Dr. Tarak
        El-Bialy of the Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry. "And because
        we can regrow the teeth root, a patient could have his own tooth
        rather than foreign objects in his mouth." </p>
      <p>El-Bialy discovered ultrasound could be used to form new dental
        tissue from his research on rabbit incisors, which was published
        in the American Journal of Orthodontics and Dentofacial
        Orthopedics. </p>
      <p>He then tested the technique on people who needed to get their
        teeth pulled. </p>
      <p>Participants held the bulky ultrasound device for 20 minutes a
        day for four weeks against a tooth that had a problem, such as
        erosion after a root canal. </p>
      <p>When El-Bialy looked at the extracted teeth under the
        microscope, he found new tissue was added to the roots of
        treated teeth, but not to untreated ones. The therapy
        regenerates the inner part of the tooth, but not the enamel. </p>
      <p>He then teamed up with engineers Jie Chen and Ying Tsui to make
        the ultrasound device smaller so it could fit comfortably inside
        a patient's mouth. </p>
      <p>The prototype can be mounted on braces or a plastic removable
        crown. </p>
      <p>The team has filed for a patent on their prototype in the U.S.
        They expect to have a version that is ready for patients within
        two years. <br>

        Published: Wednesday, June 28, 2006 </p>
      <p>EDMONTON - Long used as a test for pregnant women, ultrasound
        may soon have a new role -- growing teeth. </p>
      <p>A team of University of Alberta researchers is seeking a U.S.
        patent on a tiny device that will sit inside the mouth and beam
        ultrasound waves at teeth. </p>
      <p>The device won't help Ryan Smyth, the Edmonton Oiler who lost
        three teeth in the hockey playoffs, but it may prevent tooth
        damage that can occur from wearing braces. </p>
      <p>And it may do much more than that. The research team envisages
        bandages embedded with tiny ultrasound machines that may some
        day be wrapped around broken legs to help the bone heal more
        quickly. </p>
      <p>The idea originated with Dr. Tarek El-Bialy, an Egyptian-born
        orthodontist who joined the university's faculty of dentistry a
        year ago. </p>
      <p>El-Bialy has shown in earlier research that ultrasound waves,
        the high frequency sound waves normally used for diagnostic
        imaging, help bones heal and tooth material grow. </p>
      <p>"I was using ultrasound to stimulate bone formation after
        lower-jaw lengthening in rabbits," El-Bialy said in an interview
        Tuesday. </p>
      <p>To his surprise, not only did he help heal the rabbits' jaws
        after the surgery, but their teeth started to grow as well. </p>
      <p>He later did a human study to see if ultrasound could prevent
        damage to the roots of teeth when people wear braces. Braces
        force the teeth to move, and that can cause root damage. </p>
      <p>That study, published in 2004, showed that a tooth getting a
        daily shot of ultrasound was protected from damage, and in fact
        had more dental tissue than before. </p>
      <p>"The problem was that the ultrasound device we were using was
        very big, and the patient had to hold it in his mouth for 20
        minutes every day," El-Bialy said. </p>
      <p>When he moved to the U of A, he joined forces with two members
        of the engineering faculty, Jie Chen and Ying Tsui, to design an
        ultrasound machine small enough to sit inside a person's mouth.
        Chen is an expert in small-circuit devices, Tsui in ultrasound.
        They think it will take a year to create a workable ultrasound
        device less than a centimetre long, small enough to attach to
        braces or to a plastic temporary crown and powered by a tiny
        battery. </p>
      <p>Tsui said once the device -- which has been named LIPUS, for
        low-intensity pulsed ultrasound -- is created, it can be used
        for a variety of purposes. One idea is to make bandages embedded
        with tiny ultrasound devices, for healing broken bones. </p>
      <p>Ultrasound has also been shown to stimulate the growth of stem
        cells, the cells that create all other cells, he said. An
        ultrasound device could be made for triggering stem cell
        reproduction. </p>
      <p>El-Bialy also has work to do. So far, he has been able to
        stimulate growth of the inner part of teeth, but not the enamel.
        That's why he can't regrow Ryan Smyth's teeth. </p>
      <p>He's starting new research to try to use ultrasound to repair
        cracked or broken teeth. </p>
      <p>The researchers estimate their LIPUS device will be ready for
        public use within two years. </p>
