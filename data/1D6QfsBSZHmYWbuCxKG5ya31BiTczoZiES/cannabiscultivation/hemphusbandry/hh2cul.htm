      <a name="HH21"></a><b>2.1 ~ Introduction</b>
      <p>Edward Antil recommended the cultivation of cannabis in his <i>Observations
on

          the Raising and Dressing of Hemp</i> (1777), thus: </p>
      <p>"Hemp is one of the most profitable productions the earth
        furnishes in northern climates... It becomes worthy of the
        serious attention of the different legislatures of the northern
        colonies, of every trading man, and of every man, who truly
        loves his country. </p>
      <p>"But as the people of America do not appear, from their present
        management, to be acquainted with the best and most profitable
        method of cultivating and managing this valuable plant, I beg
        leave to inform them of some things that may be of advantage to
        them." <b>(1)</b> </p>
      <p>The anonymous Farmer from Annapolis also asserted the benefits
        of hemp husbandry in his <i>Essay on the Culture and Management
          of Hemp</i> (1775): </p>
      <p>" Hemp is one of those plants which may be cultivated in many
        different situations, and in almost every different soil, no
        plant yielding, in our climate [New England], a crop more
        certain or more advantageous. </p>
      <p>"A most peculiar advantage attending the culture of this plant,
        that it may be repeatedly sown on the same piece of ground,
        experience having shown that any dry land... properly prepared
        with manure, will produce much heavier crops than the richest
        fresh lands, and that the same piece of ground, assisted with a
        moderate quantity of manure, will admit of being successively
        sown, probably to the end of time, without any diminuation of
        crops. </p>
      <p>"How easy therefore it is in every man&#8217;s power to prepare, even
        on the meanest ground, a portion of ground sufficient to raise
        what is necessary to supply, at least, his family&#8217;s wants? It
        will not require a fourth, perhaps not a tenth of the ground
        necessary to produce an equal quantity of flax... </p>
      <p>"Hemp also produces a most certain crop, it being by no means
        subject to those accidents to which flax is exposed, from the
        uncertainty of seasons; rain, it is true, is necessary at the
        time of sowing, and it will indeed be something extraordinary if
        there doth not happen, during the course of ten weeks (for so
        long the season for sowing Hemp continues) a shower sufficient
        for this purpose, for its vegetation is so quick, that, in a
        very few days after it is sown, its leaves entirely cover and
        shade the ground, protect it from the scorching sun, enable it
        to retain the moisture, and prevent the seeds of the common
        weeds from sprouting. From this time the dews alone will prove
        sufficient to bring it to perfect maturity, and, indeed, heavier
        crops are produced on ground highly manured, in dry seasons,
        than in over wet years. </p>
      <p>"The more we consider the nature and properties of hemp, and
        reflect how happily it is adapted to our climate and soil, the
        more reason there is to wish that the inhabitants of these
        colonies would avail themselves of its advantages... </p>
      <p>"Nothing is wanted but the countenance, example, and
        encouragement of people of influence; and docility, attention,
        and industry in the poor... </p>
      <p>"Now Hemp does not require half the rain that flax does; this
        is a circumstance that is well worth the notice and attention of
        every farmer; and therefore by his raising Hemp... he can with
        greater certainty supply all the necessary uses for his family;
        and by selling the overplus, he can purchase such things as his
        wife and daughters may think convenient on extraordinary
        occasions. This however need not hinder him from raising some
        flax every year. But I think that it is more for his interest to
        fix his chief dependence upon his crop of Hemp, as that is more
        sure, and in every way more profitable, the general run of
        seasons considered... </p>
      <p>"From experience, then, we have reason to despair of raising
        flax in sufficient quantities to answer all our demands... A
        total neglect of flax is not intended to be recommended; where
        it succeeds tolerably, let the raising of it be continued, but
        the author hopes to be able to show, that, where the cultivation
        of flax cannot be carried on to advantage, Hemp may be
        substituted in its room, and will effectually answer, especially
        in coarse manufactures, every purpose to which flax hath been
        applied... Beneficent nature, which has made this plant so
        usefully, hath also most indulgently suited it to almost every
        climate, as well as to every sort of soil.<b>" (2)</b> </p>
      <p>Timothy Painne, who edited M. Marcandier&#8217;s <i>Treatise on Hemp</i>,
        was confident that his fellow Americans would be pleased to grow
        more of the crop once they learned of its many benefits. That
        seed of hope remains viable today: </p>
      <p>"If they apply themselves to the cultivation of Hemp, and carry
        to perfection the methods of preparing it, what resources will
        they not find, in employment so profitable, and at the same time
        so easy? For to consider only its common qualities, it must be
        acknowledged, that it is a commodity absolutely necessary. The
        use of it extends to almost all the purposes of commerce and of
        life. There is no state nor condition that can be without it.
        The very person who cultivates it, is the first to make use of
        it for cloathing, and of all his labours, this is often the only
        fruit which he retains. There is a singular kind of circulation
        in this commodity; nothing that bears a near resemblance to it
        is to be found in the other productions of life. The more it is
        used, the more you increase its consumption. The cultivation
        alone is a labor that requires inhabitants, and the consumption
        of it serves to maintain them. In the different methods of
        preparing it, young men and women, old men and children, find
        employment, in proportion to their strength and ability. Some
        find business in preparing the ground and sowing it; others pull
        the Hemp, and water-brake it; others make ropes or cloth; all of
        them join in the consumption, and make use of it; and every one
        jointly and severally contributes to renew their work."<b> (3)</b>
      </p>
      <p>John Bordley assures us likewise in his discourse on <i>Hemp </i>(1799):


      </p>
      <p>"If the ground be good and well prepared, no crop is more
        certain than Hemp sowed in time and when the soil is moist. But,
        how uncertain is the tobacco crop! Failure of plants from frost,
        drought, or fly; want of seasonable weather for planting;
        web-worm, horn-worm, buttening low, for want of rain, curling or
        trenching, from too much rain; house-burning or funking whilst
        curing; frost before housed; heating in bulk or in the hogshead,
        inspection, culling, &amp;c. Cultivating tobacco cleans, but
        exposes the soil to exhalation and washing away. It is only
        about a month that it shelters the ground: but Hemp shades it
        from May &#8216;till about the first of August... </p>
      <p>"A planter gaining 20 hogsheads of tobacco from 20 acres of
        ground, value 600 dollars, might expect 12,000 or 16,000 lbs of
        Hemp from the same ground, value 1,000 or 1,200 dollars. But, if
        the income from Hemp should be a fourth less than from the
        tobacco crop, yet I would, on several accounts, prefer the hemp
        culture." <b>(4)</b> </p>
      <p>Edmund Quincey also offered his personal assurance to American
        farmers in a booklet on <i>Hemp</i> (1799): </p>
      <p>"It may be expected, that, in the common way of [broadcast]
        sowing, an acre of good land will produce 7 or 8 bushels, but in
        the horse-hoeing or drill method, 10 or 12 bushels, and
        sometimes more. This makes the female Hemp more valuable than
        the male: and this must continue to be the case for some years
        in America, while this branch of husbandry is growing, as the
        American seed, may be more certainly depended on, than any from
        Europe: and indeed every husbandman who finds he has
        encouragement to encrease the quantity of his Hemp soils, will
        annually find a want of the greater part of his best seed,
        especially in a new country, abounding with so much suitable
        land for raising hemp, as these American colonies do; for which
        reason, the Farmer may for some years, almost assure himself,
        that what seed he can spare will produce him near the same price
        which he pays for the seed he purchases to begin with: this I
        mention as a considerable inducement for him to begin upon this
        profitable branch of husbandry, and am persuaded, he will see
        the observation to be just.. </p>
      <p>"When he is told, that the same acre of land will yield him an
        equally good crop of Hemp, the third year, in case he plows it
        up as soon as the crop is pulled, and cross-plows it in about
        three weeks later; and will afford it a summer fallowing, and
        twice or thrice plowing the following year: I presume the Farmer
        will be inclined to make the experiment, altho&#8217; only upon a
        quarter of an acre, which I heartily recommend to him; and
        sincerely wish him success." <b>(5)</b> </p>
      <p>Thomas Jefferson determined that, "A hand can tend 3 acres of
        hemp a year." About 20 man-hours per acre are required to
        produce a crop of hemp. The operations are: plowing, disking,
        harrowing, seeding, rolling, reaping, bundling, spreading,
        picking-up, breaking, hackling, baling, and transporting. </p>
      <p>David Marcus compared hemp and three other crops in his study
        of <i>Commercial Hemp: An Economic Justification </i>(1997).
        He showed by comparison to canola, grain corn, and spring wheat,
        that hemp is by far the most profitable crop of choice: </p>
      <p>"I estimate that growing for seed and fiber will generate long
        term combined revenues of $244-430/acre. The total expected
        costs of growing hemp for seed are $237/acre; even in a 'worst
        case' scenario, a minimum return of $7.25 is expected... This is
        slightly better than the expected return from spring wheat...
        The median expected hemp yields and prices generate expected
        returns which are more than double the next best crop, Ontario
        canola, and the highest estimates (which still should be
        considered conservative) are really quite exceptional compared
        to the other crops... Currently, hemp oil sells wholesale for
        approximately $38.50/kg. At an extraction rate of 25% and seed
        yields of 0.3-0.5 tons/acre, an acre of seed pressed for oil
        will gross C$2900-$4800." <b>(6)</b> </p>
      <p>In comparison, spring wheat and canola cost $102.48 and
        $108.02/acre respectively. Production costs in Ontario (1995)
        were about $5/acre higher. Grain corn cost $202.79/acre, and
        canola cost $121.58. According to farmers&#8217; opinions expressed in
        the <i>Hemp Commerce &amp; Farming Report</i> (May 2000; <a
          href="http://www.hemphasis.com%29/">www.hemphasis.com</a>),
        hemp
        grain must sell for about 35 cents/lb to be competitive with soy
        or flax. </p>

      <b>2.2 ~ Soil</b>
      <p>It is imperative to analyze soil samples before commencing to
        sow hemp. Tests should be performed to determine pH, levels of
        organic matter, and macro- and micro-elements. Soil pH should
        range between 6.3 to 7.8, and it should contain at least 3.5%
        organic matter (more is better). Phosphorus should be at least
        &gt;40 ppm, potassium &gt;250 ppm, sulfur &gt;5000 ppm, and
        calcium &lt;6000 ppm. The ratios of elements also should be
        determined. For example, high levels of calcium bind phosphorus
        and make it unavailable to the plants --- a problem that can be
        avoided by testing the soil. </p>
      <p>Hemp should not be sown on spring-plowed sod. The plowing depth
        should be about 8 inches so as to give a deep bed for root
        development. Less than 6 inches of plow-depth gives much lower
        yields. The land should be given a deep plowing in the fall so
        the winter weather can crumble the soil. After the field is
        furrowed, the topsoil is packed and smoothed with a ring roller.
        It must also be smoothed finely with a disk harrow in the
        spring. If the topsoil cracks open after sowing, the cracks must
        be cleared away with a hoe or roller. </p>
      <p>The timing of fall plowing significantly affects the overall
        yield of the following hemp crop: the sooner, the better. Late
        plowing reduces yields by as much as 30%. </p>
      <p>The USDA <i>Farmer&#8217;s Bulletin</i> No. 1935, entitled "Hemp",
        was issued to farmers in 1943 to initiate them to the subtleties
        of hemp cultivation. The bulletin advises: </p>
      <p>"Hemp should not be grown on poor soils. To obtain good yields
        and fiber of high quality, it is necessary to have a growth of
        uniform stalks 6 to 8 feet long. Short stalks, from poor
        nonfertile lands, seldom produce a high-quality fiber... [Hemp
        grows well in the Corn Belt, but] if land will not produce from
        50 to 70 bushels of corn per acre, it should not be planted to
        hemp for fiber production." <b>(7)</b> </p>
      <p>A report by Lyster Dewey in the USDA <i>Yearbook </i>(1913)
        states: </p>
      <p>"On the best farms the crop is cultivated four times --- twice
        rather deep and twice with cultivators with fine teeth, merely
        stirring the surface." <b>(8)</b> </p>
      <p>During World War II, the German government published<i> The
          Humorous HempPrimer</i> to educate farmers and encourage its
        cultivation. Moor land was recommended as proper ground for
        hemp. That is true, <i>but only for seed hemp</i>, not fiber
        crops: </p>
      <p>"He who grows hemp in the moor is carrying on true moor-culture
        since the options are quite limited: the moor farmer grows
        potatoes, cabbage, and some grains as well as corn. Little else
        can grow here. </p>
      <p>"When growing other crops in the marsh, even if the seeds
        sprout nicely, the weed growth is extensive. Hacking and hoeing
        without rest, as the moisture seeps out, the moor gets dusty and
        useless. The farmer&#8217;s efforts are constantly hindered by strong
        weed growth. </p>
      <p>"Here the mighty hemp plant enters as saviour of the moor
        lands. It grows quick and large and helps cultivate the lands.
        Most any crop is happy to alternate with hemp, since hemp&#8217;s
        shady umbrella forces weeds to their knees. It keeps the moor
        ground dark, clean and healthy. Also the moor&#8217;s tendency to late
        rust doesn&#8217;t bother hemp a bit. Even virgin soil in the marsh
        can yield weak hemp production. However, when properly drained,
        hemp performance is quickly improved. In short, marsh values are
        increased by sowing hemp! </p>
      <p>'In many areas, both in mountains or valleys, hemp removes many
        inherent weaknesses of the soil if first one lowers the
        groundwater level... [to] at least 50 cm [20 in.] below the
        surface."<b> (9)</b> </p>
      <p>The USDA advised to the contrary in <i>Farmers&#8217; Bulletin</i>
        No. 1935: </p>
      <p>"Muck or peat soils are not recommended for the production of
        high-quality hemp fiber. The quantity of fiber produced per acre
        on these soils may be very high, but experience has demonstrated
        that the fiber lacks strength, which is the first requirement of
        hemp fiber for good cordage." </p>
      <p>In his <i>Treatise of Hemp Husbandry</i> (1775), Edmund
        Quincey recommended an additional plowing after mellowing the
        soil: </p>
      <p>"The last time the ground must be plowed in ridges of about six
        feet wide, flat and even on the top as they can be laid, with a
        small interval between each ridge, sufficient for the pullers to
        pass, when the male hemp is ready for pulling. </p>
      <p>"The reason why the ridges are to be made thus narrow, is for
        the more convenient pulling of the male Hemp, which is always
        pulled several weeks before the female... being sowed in ridges
        you are enabled to pull the former, without bruising or
        otherwise damaging the latter, which is very prejudicial to the
        crop." </p>
      <p>Hemp loosens, mellows, and shades the soil, and the fallen
        foliage forms a mulch that preserves moisture and bacteria in
        the soil. The root system decays quickly after the harvest. Up
        to two-thirds of the organic matter returns to the soil if hemp
        is field-retted. Hemp depletes some humus; nonetheless, it is
        easier on the land than any other crops except alfalfa and
        clover. </p>

      <p>Hemp requires at least 20-30 inches of rainfall during the
        growing period, and irrigation is necessary if precipitation is
        less than adequate. Abundant moisture is needed during the
        germination period. The absorption of water by hemp increases
        daily until flowering begins. Then the uptake of water decreases
        considerably, with a subsequent increase occurring at late
        flowering and during seed formation. In total, 80-130 gallons of
        water are required to produce 1 kg of dry fiber. Hemp uses twice
        as much water in light soil than it does in medium soils. There
        is also a significant correlation between soil moisture and
        cannabinoid content. </p>
      <p>L. Slonov performed extensive tests from 1975-1977 to determine
        the correlation between water supply and ATPase enzyme activity
        in hemp: </p>
      <p>"The optimal water deficit for normal metabolism in hemp plants
        was 7-15% of total leaf saturation. Soil moisture should not go
        below 80% of total moisture capacity during hemp ontogenesis." <b>(10)</b>
      </p>
      <p>USDA <i>Farmers&#8217; Bulletin</i> No. 1935 had this to say about
        water: </p>
      <p>"Drought conditions, if accompanied by high temperatures,
        appear to hasten maturity before the plants are fully grown...
        Hemp requires a plentiful supply of moisture throughout its
        growing season, especially during the first 6 weeks. After it
        has become well rooted and the stalks are 20 to 30 inches high
        it will endure drier conditions, but a severe drought hastens
        its maturity and tends to dwarf its growth. It will endure heavy
        rains, or even a flood of short duration, on light, well-drained
        soils, but on heavy, impervious soils excessive rain, especially
        when the plants are young, will ruin the crop. </p>
      <p>"The hemp plants in puddled areas of a saturated field will be
        ruined within two days; it is imperative that the field be
        well-drained. On the other hand, if the slope of a field is too
        steep, precipitation will run off the field before it can be
        retained. If excess winter moisture or heavy rains are likely,
        the field should be plowed with water-furrows every 30-40 feet,
        leading to drainage ditches." </p>
      <p><i><b>Irrigation </b>--- </i>Three-fourths of the farmland in
        America could grow hemp up to 15 feet tall if adequate water was
        available; irrigation is therefore recommended. G. Kr'stev and
        I. Furdzhev conducted a study of the effect of irrigation on
        hemp; the yield of dry stems increased by 20%. </p>
      <p>The practice of cultivating hemp under irrigation was developed
        by George W. Schlichten (inventor of the decorticator of that
        name). He published a small treatise on the subject, providing
        the following instructions: </p>
      <p>"The land upon which hemp is to be grown by irrigation must, of
        course, be level within the checks, so as to assure an even and
        thorough irrigation... [After plowing and harrowing,] the checks
        are to be made and they may need some leveling within the
        checks. The size of the checks will vary according to the lay of
        the land and the volume of water available for irrigation. The
        checks can be made in the same manner and of the same size as
        those for alfalfa." </p>
      <p>"Before planting the hemp the land must be thoroughly
        irrigated, which is best done by making a number of cross checks
        within the borders. Within these cross checks the water should
        be held until the ground is thoroughly soaked. This insures a
        perfect seed bed and an even germination of the seed. </p>
      <p>"As soon as the land is dry enough for working it should be
        thoroughly loosened up by a spring tooth harrow going lengthwise
        within the checks... </p>
      <p>"Referring to a general practice, the first irrigation of the
        growing hemp should be given when it is needed, or when it will
        do the most good, as the timely first irrigation is, so to say,
        the making of the crop, as far as the stand is concerned. The
        time to give the first irrigation is when the young hemp plants
        do not continue a vigorous growth, or indicate otherwise the
        lack of moisture in the ground, whether they are 6 inches above
        the ground or 2 feet. </p>
      <p>"For the experienced grower it is best that the first
        irrigation is given as soon as the plants are tall enough to
        shade the ground. If irrigated before that time, because of lack
        of moisture in the land, the surface of the ground is liable to
        cake or harden, and that would necessitate another irrigation
        about a week or 10 days thereafter, which will bring about that
        the plants shade the ground. </p>
      <p>"The land should be level within the checks and with good solid
        borders, so there will be no trouble to irrigate properly and
        thoroughly, covering every part of the check sufficiently with
        water. If borders have to be reinforced or cross-checks have to
        be put up by shovel when irrigating, then a certain percentage
        of the crop is destroyed, to say nothing of the time and labor
        that have to be applied. It therefore pays to prepare the land
        right before planting. </p>
      <p>"No water should be left standing in the checks, and the ends
        of the checks must be drained a few hours after the irrigation,
        or the end water can be let into the adjoining check that is to
        be irrigated next. </p>
      <p>"The subsequent irrigations usually follow at an interval of
        about 2 or 4 weeks, according to the condition of the soil or
        weather. The crop must be kept growing steadily and according to
        that the irrigations have to be timed. Failure to irrigate when
        it is necessary is liable to stunt the crop, and that checks the
        growing." </p>

      <p><b>2.4&nbsp;<a name="HH24"></a> ~ Temperature</b> </p>
      <p>Tamm determined that hempseed needs a minimum temperature of
        1-2<sup>o</sup> C for germination and emergence. It should not
        be sown until the soil temperature rises to 10<sup>o</sup> C.
        The optimum temperature is 35<sup>o</sup> C; the maximum is 45<sup>o</sup>
        C, at which temperature the seeds sprout within 12 days.Young
        hemp plants can survive frost as low as -5<sup>o</sup> C, but
        the plants will stop growing even if warm weather follows. The
        temperature range for hemp growth is 19-25<sup>o </sup>C (66-77<sup>o</sup>
        F). Hemp enters into its rapid growth stage (about 2 inches/day)
        when the average temperature rises to 16<sup>o</sup> C (61<sup>o</sup>
        F). If southern varieties of hemp are grown in northern
        latitudes, however, the fiber might not attain technical
        maturity within 110-115 days, and certainly their seeds will not
        ripen. The farmer must consider this when selecting a hemp
        cultivar for his location. </p>
      <p>C. Richez-Dumanois, <i>et al</i>., studied the <i>in vitro</i>
        propagation of hemp clones, thus: </p>
      <p>"Morphological and chemical development decreased at low
        temperature and was promoted by a regime of 22<sup>o</sup> C
        (daily temperature) and 17<sup>o</sup> C (night) under 24 hour
        illumination and 70% relative humidity." <b>(62)</b> </p>
      <p>The phenotypic expression of cannabis is strongly influenced by
        the temperatures of the soil and air. This effect can be used to
        advantage in breeding. C. Nelson conducted such&nbsp;
        experiments with these results: </p>
      <p>Air 30<sup>o</sup> C/Soil 30<sup>o</sup> C: Maximum elongation,
        number of nodes, leaf abscission, and water consumption;
        earliest maturation; minimum leaf area; many staminate flowers.
      </p>
      <p>Air 30<sup>o</sup> C/Soil 15<sup>o</sup> C: Maximum stem
        weight; minimum plant weight; many staminate flowers. </p>
      <p>Air 15<sup>o</sup> C/Soil 30<sup>o</sup> C: Maximum leaf size,
        stem diameter and weight; sex reversals from pistillate to
        staminate. </p>
      <p>Air 15<sup>o</sup> C/Soil 15<sup>o</sup> C: Maximum leaf area
        and root water content; minimum water consumption; latest
        blooming; many pistillate flowers with sex reversals from
        pistillate to staminate. </p>
      <p>During the flowering phase, the optimal temperature is 16<sup>o</sup>
        C (61<sup>o </sup>F) during the critical night period, and 28<sup>o</sup>
        C (80<sup>o </sup>F)during the photoperiod. </p>

      <p><b>2.5&nbsp;<a name="HH25"></a> ~ Sowing</b> </p>
      <p>Hemp may require up to three years to acclimatize to a new
        locale. This fact has caused problems for many new hemp farmers,
        who expected much higher yields than they actually achieved. It
        is recommended that experimental plots of seed hemp be grown to
        develop a localized strain before committing to large-scale
        cultivation. The best variety must be selected with careful
        consideration for the differences in yields of seed and stalk,
        maturation (early or late), and fiber content, etc; an error in
        this wise can result in a shortfall of 30% or more. </p>
      <p>The art and science of producing the finest quality hemp fiber
        requires that perfect seed be sown at the proper time in
        prepared soil. Good hempseed is bright gray and plump, and has a
        nutty taste. White seed will not germinate; green seed is
        unripe, germinates slowly, and produces weak plants that are
        smothered by more vigorously growing hemp. Black seeds have
        fermented due to improper drying after harvesting; they taste
        rancid. </p>
      <p>The USDA warned farmers about "lint seed" (linseed): </p>
      <p>"In some instances seed is saved from hemp grown for fiber but
        permitted to get overripe before cutting. This is known as lint
        seed. It is generally regarded as inferior to seed from
        cultivated plants. A good crop is sometimes obtained from lint
        seed, but it is often lacking in vigor [heterosis] as well as
        germinative vitality, and it is rare that good crops are
        obtained from lint seed of the second or third generation." </p>
      <p>One bushel of hempseed weighs 21 kg (44 lb). If hempseed is
        good, at least 95% will germinate, though a germination
        potential of 85-90% is considered to be acceptable. The water
        content should be about 12%. <b>(11)</b> </p>
      <p>As of 1998, only 44 registered varieties of hemp exist, and
        only 32 are available. Such an extremely limited base could make
        hemp crops vulnerable to devastating blights. The gene pool is
        acclimatized to 45-55<sup>o</sup> N latitude (Europe, Canada,
        and the northern states of the USA). The IHA has recommended
        that tropical germplasm, which contain high levels of
        psychoactive THC, be drawn upon for development. </p>
      <p>The most popular French varieties are the monoecious Ferimon-12
        and Futura-77, hybrid Fedora-34, and Fedrina-74. The Hungarian
        variety Kompolti, bred by the renowned hemp breeder Dr. Ivan
        Bocsa, contains 35-38% "technical" fibers, with a maximum yield
        of 12 tons/hectare within 115 days. Other available Hungarian
        varieties are Uniko-B, Fibriko, and other Kompolti cultivars.
        They are marketed by Fibro-Seed Gmbh (H-3356 Kompolt, Hungary).
        The hemp grown in Asian countries are landraces, not cultivars,
        and have little economic significance in Europe. In America,
        however, Kentucky hemp was developed from a cross of Chinese and
        European cannabis. This gene pool has become feral since 1937
        and needs to be redeveloped. Canadian farmers are permitted to
        grow about two dozen varieties of seed, including Anka, the
        first Canadian cultivar. </p>
      <p>The yield and quality of fiber is strongly influenced by the
        seeding rate. Hempseed is sown at the rate of at least one
        bushel per acre, and up to 5 pecks is common. Germination will
        be uneven if the seed is planted deeper than 1.6 inches. Shallow
        seeding also produces erratic germination.The seeds must not be
        covered more than one-half inch deep. Roller disk drills give
        better results than tooth drills, and rolling the land after
        seeding benefits the crop. When compared to other methods, strip
        sowing considerably improves all the qualitative indices of hemp
        fibers. <b>(12)</b> </p>
      <p>S. Losev studied the effects of seeding rates and methods of
        sowing hempseed. He concluded: </p>
      <p>"With continuous sowing of hemp in rows spaced at 15 cm, on
        well-fertilized soil, about 100 kg/ha of 100% valid seed should
        be sown (4.5 million seeds). With close-spaced drill sowing
        (with the rows spaced at 7.5 cm) the rate must be raised to 120
        kg/ha (5.5 million seeds). With a shortage of seeds, and on
        weedy soils, sowing should be carried out in close ribbons (22.5
        x 7.5 cm) with a seeding rate of 60-80 kg/ha. This method allows
        for a single inter-row hoeing." <b>(13)</b> </p>
      <p>The Czeckoslovakian hemp breeder F. Baxa reported these results
        of his experiments with sowing density: </p>
      <p>"On fertile soils greater yields were obtained when sown in
        rows 7.5 and 12.5 cm apart. Soils with lower fertility yielded
        significantly more stalks and fiber when sown in rows 22.5 cm
        apart. In both cases a seeding rate of 100 kg/ha proved best." <b>(14)</b>
      </p>
      <p>Extensive tests have shown that the best growth of a small crop
        of seed hemp is achieved when the seeds are planted in mounds at
        least one yard apart, at a rate of a dozen per mound (10-15
        kg/ha). When the plants are about a foot tall, they must be
        thinned to only 4 or 5 per hill, or one plant per 20 inches.
        Good stands cannot be obtained with thin seeding, and good
        plants cannot be obtained without thinning. Large crops of
        dual-use (fiber and seed) hemp are planted in rows up to 16
        inches (40 cm) apart. It is sown at a rate of 12-20 kg/ha
        (60-100 plants/m<sup>2</sup>),
        depending
        on the row spacing, with 7 seeds per linear foot of row (20
        grams per thousand grain weight). When grown for seed alone,
        hemp is sown in rows at least two feet apart with only two or
        three seeds per foot. Seed hemp should not be grown more than
        800 feet above sea level, because the seeds probably will not
        mature in due time, even if it is an early variety. <b>(15)</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Anonymous Farmer recommended this plan for cultivating a
        crop for its seed: </p>
      <p>"A far better method is to raise the seede apart by itselfe,
        either on a portion of the ground allotted for the HEMP, or what
        would be yet more proper, on any good spot that is convenient
        for this purpose, which must be reduced into proper tilth...
        This ought to be done as soon as the frosts are over, for,
        provided that the weather is mild and will permit, the earlier
        what you intend to raise seed from is put into the ground the
        better, not only because the forward plants bring their seeds
        better to maturity, there will be time to sow the ground again.
      </p>
      <p>"The season for sowing being come, the ground should be laid
        off, either with the plow or hoe, into flat hills, about 4 feet
        asunder, in each of these hills, about 10 to 15 grains of the
        HEMP seed may be deposited, and as soon as they are sprung to
        such a height as to be past danger from frost, or other
        accidents, the hills ought to be thinned, pulling up the
        superfluous stalks, leaving about 8 or 9 plants in each hill...
        An acre of ground, managed in this manner, will produce from 20
        to 25 or 30 bushels of seed." </p>
      <p>Thomas Jefferson noted the following in his farm journals: </p>
      <p>"To make hemp seed, make hills of the form &amp; size of
        cucumber hills, from 4 to 6 ft apart, in proportion to the
        strength of the ground. Prick about a dozen seeds into each
        hill, in different parts of it. When they come up thin them in
        two. As soon as the male plants have shed their farina, cut them
        up that the whole nourishment may go to the female plants. Every
        plant thus tended will yield a quart of seed. A bushel of good
        brown seed is enough for an acre." </p>
      <p>Edward Antil offered these considerations in his <i>Observations</i>:
      </p>
      <p><i>"</i>If you have no convenient place to sow your seed Hemp
        by itself, then sow a border of 6 feet wide along the north and
        west sides of your Hemp field; the reason of sowing your seed
        Hemp in such narrow ridges or borders is that, when the carle or
        he Hemp is ripe, and has shed its farina on the fimble or female
        Hemp, by which the seed is impregnated, and the leaves of the
        carle hemp fall off and the stem grows yellow, you may easily
        step in along the sides and pull up the carle Hemp without
        hurting the female, which now begins to branch out, and looks of
        a deep green colour and very flourishing, and when the seeds
        begin to ripen, which is known by their falling out of their
        sockets, you may all along both sides bend down the plants and
        shake out the seed upon a cloth laid on the ground, for as they
        ripen they scatter upon being shaken by a hard wind, or
        otherwise, then it must be watched, and the fowls... kept from
        it, for they are immoderately fond of the seed." </p>
      <p>Fiber hemp crops are thickly seeded using a standard grain
        drill or modified alfalfa seeder, at&nbsp; a rate of 55-70
        kg/hectare (ha = 2.47 acres). The row width should be 4 to 8
        inches, and not more than 10 inches. Field studies have shown
        that the maximum yield of dry plant matter is obtained with a
        seeding rate of no more than 80 kg/ha (70 lb/acre). Excessive
        seeding will produce hemp of insufficient height and no value to
        the farmer. The optimal plant density is about 160 per square
        meter in nitrogenous soil, up to 260/m<sup>2</sup> in mineral
        soil. The percentage of bast fiber increases with the seeding
        rate. 40-50 kg/ha will yield about 200 plants/m<sup>2</sup> at
        emergence, self-thinning to about 140/m<sup>2</sup> at harvest.
        Tests conducted in 1972 by J. Ritz determined that there was no
        influence of stand density on the yield of stems with 100, 125
        and 150 plants/m<sup>2</sup>. </p>
      <p>Analyses of modern fiber hemp production in The Netherlands
        indicate that crop productivity can be improved by earlier
        sowing, albeit at risk of suffering from frosts.&nbsp; According
        to an idealized crop growth model, sowing on April 15 and
        harvesting on September 15 should yield about 1 ton/ha of dry
        stems. Sowing on April 1 would increase the yield by 2.3
        tons/ha. Sowing on April 30 would reduce the yield of stems by
        1.4 tons/ha; sowing on May 15 would reduce the expected yield by
        3 tons/ha. </p>
      <p>At latitudes south of 35<sup>o</sup> hemp can be planted in any
        month if there is sufficient moisture to germinate the seed
        before solar heat kills it. That can be prevented somewhat if
        the seed is covered two inches deep and lightly harrowed. </p>
      <p>In the USA, at the latitude of New York City/Indianapolis, hemp
        can be sown as early as March 25, and harvested in the last week
        of June. A second crop can be sown and harvested early in
        October. Only one crop can be planted north of 40<sup>o</sup>
        latitude. </p>
      <p>If the field has been prepared for irrigation as described by
        George Schlichten, the following method should be applied: </p>
      <p>"The seeding should be done crosswise over the checks, across
        the borders and about 10 checks can be seeded at a time. By
        seeding across the borders, all the land is made productive and
        the stand will be uniform in size of stalks. If the borders are
        not seeded, the hemp that grows alongside of same will produce
        big and branchy stalks (flange stalks) which make an inferior
        fiber and therefore reduce the average quality of the hemp. </p>
      <p>"After seeding, the loose and porous land should be lightly
        rolled across the checks the same way as the seeding was done;
        the heavier and more compact soil should not be rolled, but
        harrowed within the checks, that is, parallel to the border, as
        harrowing across the borders would reduce their height too much,
        but the teeth of the harrow must be set slanting." </p>
      <p>USDA <i>Farmers&#8217; Bulletin</i> # 1935 offers another
        suggestion: </p>
      <p>"A good practice in planting hemp for fiber production is to
        sow around the edge of the field next to the fence a 16- to
        18-foot width of small grains, which may be harvested before the
        hemp. Space is thus provided for the harvester to enter the
        field and begin cutting without injuring the hemp. It also
        prevents hemp plants at the edge from growing too rank. Uniform
        plants are necessary for uniform fiber quality." </p>
      <p>Wind and changes of temperature will harden the lignin and
        render the fibers coarse and "harsky" (harsh). It is important
        that the stalks grow close together under the shelter of their
        foliage, thus creating a favorable micro-climate among the
        plants. </p>
      <p>Edmund Quincey recommended this method of sowing hemp, "as has
        been very exactly experienced": </p>
      <p>"The Farmer being sure of good seed, and given his ground the
        last dressing, and thereby laid it as fine and level, as the
        border of a garden; the seed must be sown as carefully and
        regularly as possible, and as it is very tender, and will bear
        but a slight covering, care must be taken, lest by burying too
        deep, the vegitation may be prevented. Clods left unbroken with
        the Harrow and Roller, have the like effect upon much of seed,
        in the common method of sowing: Negligence in this respect has
        often ruined more than one-third of a Crop; for a great part of
        the plants will rise irregularly, and getting bad habit in their
        first shooting, the produce will be small. </p>
      <p>"The preparation of the soil in the drill way of sowing
        hemp-seed, is the same, as in the common way. The seed must be
        planted in double rows, with ten or twelve inches partition, and
        with intervals, for the passage of the hoe-plow, from three or
        four feet broad, as the soil may be more or less rich; the
        richer the soil, the narrower may be the intervals. The seed
        must be planted and covered very shallow, and is not safe in
        general if covered deeper than about half an inch, unless in
        very light soils, in which it may grow at one inch depth. </p>
      <p>"The seed let into the ground by the drill is less in danger
        from birds, because it is all covered; but yet may be watched to
        prevent their getting at it very early in the morning, and
        towards evening... </p>
      <p>"When the Hemp is four or five inches high, the Farmer sends
        into the field careful laborers with hand hoes, to cut up weeds
        which may rise in the partitions; once is sufficient, as thereby
        by the Hemp gathering much strength, it will prevent their
        rising any more. When the partitions are cleared by the hand
        hoe, then let the horse-hoe plow be set to work in the
        intervals, and with this let all the ground between the double
        rows be turned up deep and broke fine. The weeds will be
        destroyed by this, and the whole soil made fit to receive the
        roots, and nourished for their support. The good effect of this
        kind of husbandry, is in no other respect seen more evidently.
        The fibres of the roots of Hemp even in the most favorable
        soils, do not naturally spread, but lie in clusters about the
        base of the stock, their numbers answering for their shortness,
        but in the horse-hoeing way, the fibres of the plants of the two
        opposite rows will meet across, and fill the intervals, and the
        plant will flourish accordingly... by this means the ground will
        be several times enriched, while the crop is growing... [the
        soil] will retain so much of the nitrous quality of the dews and
        rains, as will render it abundantly capable of producing several
        crops, though the soil be but of a midling goodness... herein
        the Farmer is supposed to change his partitions each succeeding
        year, into the intervals of the past year&#8217;s crop, these being
        enriched by the hoe-plow cultivation..." </p>
      <p>Lionel Slator gave this advice in his <i>Instructions</i> to
        farmers: </p>
      <p>"In the sowing of Hemp, great Care and Judgment ought to be
        used, that it be not sowed too thick or too thin: In the first
        Case, it would be apt to lodge, and so lose the crop; In the
        second, the Hemp will run more to Bunn [coarse] or Straw, than
        it will to harl or Skin." </p>
      <p>Edward Quincey also noted this: </p>
      <p>"It is observed by some Farmers, that sowing early thickens the
        harle or coat of the Hemp." </p>
      <p>John Bordley gave notice to this in writing of his experience
        with <i>Hemp</i> (1799): </p>
      <p>"My hemp never suffered materially from drought but once, and
        that of a sowing in May. It was never found necessary to weed
        what was sowed for a crop: but only such as was sown very thin
        for producing seed. Sometimes seed was saved from the margin of
        the field, where the plants had room to branch and were
        coarse..." </p>
      <p>Edward Antil assured early American farmers that they could
        prophesy truly if hempseed was sown wisely, according to his <i>Observations

          on the Raising and Dressing of Hemp</i>: </p>
      <p>"The ground being moist as I said before, but by no means wet
        so as to clod, which would ruin the crop, and nothing after
        that, but too much wet, will hurt it... Whereas if the seed be
        sown, when the ground is dry, the seed that lies deepest where
        the moisture is, will come up first, and these will shade and
        starve those that come after, by which means the first comers
        will be too large, and the last will be much too small, so that
        the crop will be damaged in every way: So much depends on this
        one circumstance of sowing the seed when the ground is moist and
        fit to receive it." </p>
      <p>The anonymous 18th century "Farmer from Annapolis" emphasized
        the importance of right timing in sowing hempseed: </p>
      <p>"It may be necessary to observe, that as the Hemp which is
        first sown, provided it does not meet with any accident, most
        commonly, yields the heaviest crop... It is however by no means
        eligible to sow this seed, till you can reasonably expect that
        no danger is to be apprehended from the frost; nor is it by any
        means proper to sow when the ground is very dry, or that there
        is an appearance of a continuation of dry weather; in either of
        these cases, it will be far more prudent to delay the sowing for
        a little... the first opportunity ought to be taken to sow the
        seed, either immediately before a rain, or as soon after as the
        ground will admit; sowing before the shower ought to be
        preferred, only because the seed will be covered much better and
        more equally when the ground is dry, than when it is wet:
        immediately before sowing, the ground must be laid level with
        the harrow, and the best and quickest method of covering the
        seed is, either with a short toothed single harrow, or a bunch
        of brush, which ought to be dragged once or twice over the land,
        and directly after, a wooden roller of 15 to 18 inches diameter
        ought to be run over it; when there is only a small piece of
        ground sown, the seed may as well be covered with a garden
        rake.. </p>
      <p>"As all kinds of birds, but more particularly pigeons and
        turtle doves, are remarkably fond of this seed, and will, if
        they are permitted to frequent the ground, destroy great
        quantities of it, even during some days after it is sprung up;
        it is necessary to keep them off until it has gathered strength,
        and the leaves become expanded... No further attention is
        requisite, until the season for pulling, unless it is to observe
        that your inclosure is sufficient to keep out such animals as
        might trample or break it." </p>
      <p>Hemp was given extensive treatment in the <i>Fan Sheng-chih
          shu</i>, a Chinese treatise on farming written circa 25 BC.
        Farmers were advised to avoid the <i>ch&#8217;en</i> (the 5th in 12)
        day of the sowing period. Twenty days before being sown, the
        seeds were treated by immersing them in a decoction of powdered
        horse bones, aconite, silkworms and sheep dung. They were
        immediately dried in the sun, then stored carefully, and
        immersed again just before planting. If horse bones were not
        available, melted snow could be used instead: </p>
      <p>"Snow is the essence of cereals; it causes crops to be
        drought-resistant. Always take advantage of winter to store
        snow; fill containers and bury them in the ground... If seeds
        are treated like this, the harvest will regularly be doubled...
      </p>
      <p>"If you plant hemp too early [the males] will be hard and
        rigid, with thick skins and many knots. If you plant late then
        the skin will not be hard. It is better to err in being early
        than to err in being late." </p>
      <p><i>Ji Sheng&#8217;s Book</i> (Western Han Dynasty, 206 BC-24 AD),
        instructed farmers thus: </p>
      <p>"If the sowing time is early, the fiber will be thick and
        strong and can be harvested early. Otherwise, the fiber will not
        be mature. It is better to sow hemp seed early instead of
        late... </p>
      <p>" First, soak the seed in water and sow them as soon as they
        germinate. Soak the seed in water for about the same time
        required to cook... rice. Then spread the soaked seeds on the
        bamboo bed for about 3 to 6 <i>cun</i> [inches] in thickness.
        Stir the seed several times and after one night they will
        germinate... Second, in order to avoid plant diseases and insect
        pests, hemp should rotate with wheat, beans, and cereals. Third,
        different methods should be used with different soil moistures.
      </p>
      <p>"Disperse the sparrows for several days in order to protect the
        seeds... When the seedlings have grown for some time, thin out
        the weak ones so that... good seedlings can grow well." </p>
      <p>The venerable <i>Qi Min Yao Shu</i> ("Essential Arts for the
        People", written circa 500 AD) gave these instructions to
        farmers: </p>
      <p>"Generally, male hemp seeds are white. There are two ways to
        examine the quality of the white seeds. The first is to bite a
        seed with the teeth, and if the inside of the seed is very dry,
        it should not be sown. Otherwise the seeds can be sown. The
        second method is to put the white seed in the mouth for some
        time. The seeds that do not turn black are good." </p>
      <p>Farmers in India sometimes soak the seeds overnight in milk and
        water before sowing. A traditional Chinese method of stimulating
        the germination of hempseed is to soak them in an aqueous
        extract of the plant. According to V.E. Sustrina, this also
        increases the number of females: </p>
      <p>"Hemp seeds were soaked at 10-15<sup>o</sup> C in extracts of
        dry inflorescences; the percentage of staminate plants was
        greatly reduced." <b>(19)</b> </p>
      <p>In 1924, Luigi Leggieri described his experiments with
        pre-sowing treatments of hempseed: </p>
      <p>"<i>Confettatura</i>: a dry method [causes] an organic
        fertilizer (poudrette, meat powder, bone dust, pulverized sheep
        manure, pigeon or chicken dung, etc.) to adhere to the seed. The
        adhesion is facilitated by adding the fertilizing materials to
        clay and then rolling the seed in this or by the use of gum
        arabic. Nutritive baths (immersing the seed in water or in
        solutions of K-sulfate, ammonium nitrate, Na-nitrate, dung,
        etc.) and disinfectant baths (using solutions of Cu-sulfate,
        arsenic lime and special preparations) belong to the wet method.
        Plot tests with hempseed, previously immersed in water, 1% and
        3% potassium sulfate solutions and 1% and 3% ammonium nitrate
        solutions for 6, 12 and 24 hour periods, lead to the general
        conclusions that (1) the immersion in water has a favorable
        reaction, (2) the action of saline solutions varies with the
        seed; sulfate solutions act favorably on the hemp seed, (3) the
        duration of immersion has a great influence and hence it is
        necessary to find the optimum duration for each species.<b>
          (17)"</b> </p>
      <p>Research conducted by J. Stephan in 1928 showed that
        ortho-phosphoric acid will stimulate germination when used in 1%
        concentration for 1/2 to 1 hour even in daylight, which usually
        inhibits the germination of hempseed. </p>
      <p>G. Weeber reported his similar experiments, thus: </p>
      <p>"When distilled water was used, germination occurred at least
        twice as quickly. A further acceleration was obtained by using a
        30% solution of hydrogen peroxide; hemp seeds germinated within
        12-24 hours." <b>(18)</b> </p>
      <p>Hempseed can be induced to sprout within 12 hours if it is
        soaked in a solution of Mg-sulfate (0.8 % Epsom salt) or MgCl
        and then steamed with ether. Treatment with a 1% solution result
        in damage to the seeds. Germination occurs within 10 hours when
        hempseed is soaked in Mn-sulfate (1.5%) plus ether treatment, or
        with Pb-nitrate (0.5%) without ether treatment. Sprouting takes
        place within 6 hours when seeds are soaked in a solution of
        oxalic acid (1%), with or without ether treatment. The
        germination percentage is higher in darkness than in light. The
        resulting plants produced up to 88% increase in the dry weight
        of stems, and the plants&#8217; height increased up to 26%. The dry
        weight and height of the stems varied with formulas of the
        solutions; therefore this method can be used to improve plants
        in a systematic manner. Dry ether alone has no such influence;
        it is effective only in combination with the chemical solutions.
      </p>
      <p>Treatment with carbon dioxide or ethylene before sowing
        influences positively the growth, budding, flowering, and
        ripening of hemp. Root development, seed production and total
        yields also are greatly increased by such treatment. </p>

      <p><b>2.6&nbsp;<a name="HH26"></a> ~ Cultivation</b> </p>
      <p>Hemp intercrops happily with corn, mustard, broccoli, brussel
        sprouts, lupine, nettles, hops, and turnips. Hemp is not
        compatible with tobacco, spinach, cress, pepperweed, or vetch. </p>
      <p><i>The Humorous Hemp Primer</i> offered this encouragement: </p>
      <p>" Hemp is not demanding of prior crops. It grows well after
        fruits, vegetables, grasses and grains. Moreover, shady hemp...
        does provide the best prior crop, because its tall, wide, dense
        growth strangles weeds. After hemp, all grains grow well and
        without problems. Also, fruits which follow hemp bring larger
        crops, as do grasses, delicate and tender when they lie down in
        hemp&#8217;s bed. In short, anything sown in hemp&#8217;s fields will bring
        rich harvest and much money." </p>
      <p>The USDA <i>Farmers&#8217; Bulletin</i> No. 1935 noted: </p>
      <p>"Old pastures plowed up [in the fall] are well suited for hemp
        culture. Fields previously cropped to soybeans, alfalfa, and
        clover are excellent for hemp. A good rotation is to follow corn
        with hemp, and in Kentucky a fall cereal may follow the hemp. </p>
      <p>"When planted after fiber hemp, the yield of winter wheat is
        often increased as much as 10-20%. This cannot be done after a
        crop of seed hemp, because it is harvested late in the season."
      </p>
      <p>The introduction of hemp as a new crop into the cycle of crop
        rotations can help reduce the incidence of diseases and soil
        pathogens. Hemp improves soil structure, suppresses weeds, and
        is nearly free of diseases and pests. In ordinary schemes of
        crop rotation, hemp can occupy the same place as oats or beans.
        Hemp also responds well to a preceding crop of wheat, peas, or
        potatoes, but should not follow sod, timothy, or small grain. In
        latitudes below 40<sup>o</sup>, two crops of early-maturing hemp
        can be grown yearly, or a crop of hemp followed by a crop of
        peas to maintain the fertility and condition of the soil.
        Farmers in India plant hemp after millet, rice, indigo, tobacco,
        or coriander. Extensive experiments have shown that hemp is the
        best green manure for wheat. </p>
      <p>Lyster Dewey suggested this scheme of crop rotation for hemp: </p>

          Oats</font> </p>
      <p>S.S. Boyce gave more details in his book on <i>Hemp</i>(1900):
      </p>
      <p>"The rotation kept up by rye or vetch, hemp, peas, and again
        rye, gives as perfect a condition of soil as can be desired. The
        roots of the hemp decay early, the peas penetrate deeply and
        leave the soil porous and supplied with nitrogen and humus;
        while rye and vetch keep the soil employed, and the three
        furnish feeding material more than paying their cost, while the
        rotation prevents any cloying of the soil appetite." <b>(20)</b>
      </p>
      <p>A failed crop of hemp can be left to mature and then be burned,
        but better results will be obtained if it is plowed under as
        soon as it is certain that the crop is inadequate for fiber
        production. They rot very slowly, so mature stalks and hurds
        should be burnt rather than plowed under. </p>
      <p>Hemp prefers alkaline soil, and it will not grow well on soil
        that previously was overgrown with either sedges or huckleberry
        bushes (indicators of acidic soils). </p>
      <p>Cannabis is one of the best crops for eradicating weeds because
        it grows so quickly and suppresses their growth with its
        secretions of caffeic, ferulic, benzoic and coumaric acids. When
        hemp is planted in a fallow field, it destroys sowthistle,
        quack-grass, and cord-grass. Thus it becomes possible to grow
        two or three grain crops following hemp, whereas after ordinary
        summer-fallow, the second crop of grain usually is badly
        infested with weeds. The obnoxious bindweed is held in check by
        hemp, but the vines must be removed before the hemp goes to
        seed. Wild morning glory and bindweed vines will climb up hemp
        stalks. </p>
      <p>No herbicides are needed when the spacing is 16 inches or less,
        because the rapid growth of hemp will suppress the weeds. With
        wider spacing, herbicides may be required. Dr. Ivan Bocsa
        recommends that monocotyledons be suppressed with Benefin (1
        gal/acre of a 20% solution), applied with disc before sowing.
        Dicotyledons can be fought with Maloran (50%, 3 lb/acre),
        Patoran (2 lb/acre), or Pyramine (5 lb/acre), applied
        immediately after sowing. <b>(16)</b> </p>
      <p>When hemp is cultivated for seed, Canada thistles may appear
        among the stands and must be spudded out manually while the hemp
        is only a few inches high. Canada thistle and quackgrass can be
        killed completely by one crop of hemp. </p>
      <p>Cannabis is damaged by broomrape (<i>Orobanche ramosa, </i>chokeweed),
a

        very short plant with yellowish leaves and dull purple flowers.
        Its seeds stick to the calyx of hempseed and thus are
        transmitted. Broomrape is parasitic on the roots of hemp,
        killing the host before it can mature. Broomrape invades when
        the soil has become exhausted, or "hempsick" through neglect. It
        is prevented by crop rotation and by clean seeds. An application
        of calcium carbide to the soil in the fall effectively destroys
        broomrape seeds. Ammonium nitrate and sulfate will drastically
        reduce broomrape infestation, but these fertilizers also will
        affect crop yields. Trisodium phosphate can be combined with
        ammonium sulfate for greater effect. <b>(21)</b> </p>
      <p>Cannabis protects potatoes from late blight by <i>Phytophtora
          infestans</i>. When potato tubers are soaked in a solution of
        kansatin (extracted from hemp leaves), their germination is
        increased, the sprouts are longer and weigh more, and
        infestation by <i>Corynebacterium michiganense</i> and <i>C.
          sepedonicum</i> is reduced. Infection by stem nematode also is
        lowered considerably. Extracts of cannabis effectively reduce
        the incidence of the nematodes <i>T. brassicae</i>, <i>H.
          indicus</i>, and <i>R. reniformis</i>, and <i>M. incognita</i>.
        The whole plant and leaf extracted in water is generally
        effective against insect pests. </p>
      <p>When treated with hemp leaf extract, tomato seeds increase
        their germination by 17% and their yield by 33%. <b>(22)</b> </p>
      <p>When beans are grown together with hemp, the beans will not
        become infested with brown spot. Hemp is effective against
        infestation of asters by <i>Fusirois</i>, and it protects sugar
        beets from turnip fleas, and cabbages from white cabbage
        butterfly. Cannabis also guards peas from pea aphis (<i>Acyrthosiphon

          pisum</i>). Hemp purges may-beetle (<i>Melontha</i>) from the
        soil. Weevils cannot become established in granaries where hemp
        has been dried. </p>
      <p>C. Kok, <i>et al.</i>, have shown that the major soil
        pathogens <i>Verticillium dahliae</i> (fungus) and Columbian
        root-knot nematodes (<i>Meloidogyne chitwoodi</i> and <i>M.
          hapla</i>) are strongly suppressed by hemp. Some agronomists
        suggest that soybeans grown in rotation after hemp shows a
        significant decrease in soybean cyst nematodes. </p>
      <p>Bee breeders use hemp as a pollen insulator; no other plant is
        so effective as a hedge against pollination. </p>

      <p><b>2.7&nbsp;<a name="HH27"></a> ~ Diseases &amp; Pests</b> </p>
      <p>During World War II, all hempseed distributed by the USDA was
        treated with mercury compounds (i.e., ethyl mercury phosphate);
        these seeds yielded an average increase of 16% in the emergence
        of plants, up to 100% increase over untreated seeds in some
        instances. This was the first time that the entire national
        supply (33,000 bushels) of seed of an important crop was treated
        for protection against microorganisms. </p>
      <p>Cannabis is afflicted by over 100 diseases caused by fungi,
        bacteria, viruses, nematodes, plants, and abiotic challenges
        (genetics, nutrients, stress and pollutants) but only about a
        dozen cause serious problems. </p>
      <p>With the exception of striping virus, the most common diseases
        of hemp (i.e., <i>Hypochnus solani </i>and<i> Pythium sp.</i>)
        can be controlled by treatment of the seeds with Clorox (25%
        sodium hypochlorite) diluted with an equal volume of water and
        adjusted to pH 9. Soak the seeds for 10 minutes, then rinse
        thoroughly with fresh water. <b>(24, 25)</b> </p>
      <p>Cannabis' resistance to diseases and pests can be strengthened
        by the judicious use of methyl salicylate, which is a major
        component of wintergreen oil. Aspirin (acetyl salicylic acid)
        also is effective. Dissolve two tablets in a quart of water and
        apply the solution as a foliar spray. </p>
      <p><i><b>Fungi &amp; Bacteria</b> ---&nbsp;</i> More than 90
        species of fungi attack Cannabis. Seedlings can be infected by
        damping-off fungi; the flowers and leaves are vulnerable to grey
        mold, yellow, brown and olive leaf spots, mildew and brown
        blight, pink rot, and viruses. The stalk and stems are
        susceptible to attack by grey mold, hemp canker, <i>Fusarium
          oxysporum</i> canker and wilt, stem nema, charcoal rot,
        anthracnose, and striatura ulcerosa. The roots can be diseased
        by <i>Fusarium</i>, rhizoc, sclerotium root rot, and nematodes.
        <i>Alternaria alternata </i>Keissler,
        a common fungal pathogen of many plants, can destroy up to 45%
        of hempseed in a crop. </p>
      <p>K. Roder investigated hemp diseases, and isolated 7 strains of
        <i>Sphaerella cann., </i>13 strains of <i>Phoma</i> or <i>Phyllosticta</i>,
        and 13 forms of <i>Phomopsis, Coniothyrium, Vermicularia,
          Fusarium</i>, and<i> Cylindrocarpon</i>. None of these species
        can infect the roots of hemp directly, unless the roots are weak
        or injured. </p>
      <p>Gray mold (<i>Botrytis cinerea</i>) and hemp canker (<i>Sclerotina

          sclerotiorum</i>) can severely damage a hemp crop in wet
        years. In temperate regions with high humidity and low
        temperatures, botrytis can completely destroy a hemp crop within
        a week. Botrytis and hemp canker can be controlled by spraying
        alternately with the fungicides vinchlozolin (0.5 kg/ha) and
        iprodion (0.5 kg/ha) at two-week intervals from June through
        August. Tetramethylthiuran disulfide also is effective. Van der
        Werf, <i>et al</i>., however, found from three years of field
        experiments that one or two applications did not increase actual
        stem yield. They concluded that, "although fungal diseases may
        severely reduce hemp yield in the Netherlands, the use of
        fungicides is not worthwhile". They recommended breeding
        cultivars less susceptible to <i>B. cinerea</i> in particular.<b>
        </b>Botrytis can be controlled by applications of sulfur
        followed by "AQ-10", a microbial product. Bentonite clay also
        can control botrytis; it is better to use California
        calcium-bentonite rather than the more common sodium variety.
        Potassium bicarbonate ("Kali-Green") also kills botrytis. <b>(26)</b>
      </p>
      <p>Botrytis appears as "damping-off" (moldy germination) on
        seedlings; it can be prevented by aeration of the soil, by
        hydrogen peroxide, or by the Burgundy Formula. Dissolve 1 lb of
        calcium sulfate and 1 lb of washing-soda crystals in 10 gallons
        of water. Soak the seeds in this solution, then rinse with fresh
        water. </p>
      <p>The Chestnut Formula also prevents damping-off. Mix 2 parts
        copper sulfate and 11 parts ammonium carbonate in a glass jar.
        Dissolve 1 oz in 2 gallons of water. Soak the seeds in this
        solution, then rinse them with fresh water. </p>
      <p>Botrytis is a stem disease in fiber cultivars, arising as a
        gray-brown mycelial mat, later covered with conidia. The stem
        becomes chlorotic along the edge of the mat, then reduces to
        soft, shredded cankers; the plant often snaps at that point, or
        wilts above it. The mature floral bracts of female drug
        cultivars are most susceptible to infestation. Leaflets turn
        yellow, then wilt, and pistils become brown. Mycelia envelope
        the infloresences, which dissolve into gray-brown slime. </p>
      <p>Infection by <i>Botrytis</i> is directly affected by the level
        of calicum in the plant; the higher the amount of Ca, the lower
        the incidence of <i>Botrytis</i>. Sprays of Ca-silicate (2,000
        ppm) and Ca-formate (2,000 ppm) provide effective control of
        fungi and are safe alternatives to highly toxic fungicides. </p>
      <p>Damping off is caused by other several fungi, mostly by the
        Protoctistan oomycetes <i>Pythium aphanidermatum </i>and<i> P.
          ultimum</i>. Other causative fungi include <i>Fusarium solani</i>,
        <i>F. oxysporum</i>, <i>F. avenaceum</i>, <i>F. graminearum</i>,
        and <i>F. sulpurem, Rhizoctonia solani</i>, and <i>Macrophomina

          phaseolina</i>. </p>
      <p>The severity of infection by facultative parasites is affected
        by the levels of nitrogen and potassium; low N and high K
        provide resistance; high N and low K invite parasites. </p>
      <p>Wilt is caused by <i>Fusarium oxysporum</i> f. sp. <i>cannabis</i>
        Nov. &amp; Snyd. It first appears on 3-month old plants as a
        yellowish-green color and small dark spots on the lower leaves,
        which die but remain hanging. The plant may bend to the side of
        the stem that is affected. </p>
      <p>In 1999, Ag/Bio Con, a Montana company, offered the world a
        mutant strain of <i>Fusarium oxysporum</i> as a mycoherbicide
        against cannabis --- an utterly insane promotion that has
        instigated lawsuits to cease and desist. <i>Fusarium</i>
        mutates very easily and spreads to other crops. It is an
        environmental disaster. </p>
      <p>Verticillium wilt is caused by <i>Verticillium</i>(two
        species); <i>Macrophomina phaseolina </i>causes premature wilt
        (also known as charcoal rot). </p>
      <p>Hemp twig blight is caused by <i>Botryosphaeria maronii</i>
        (Cav.) Charles &amp; Jenkins. The leaves quickly wilt and droop
        and turn brown, but remain attached. The symptoms first appear
        on the tips of branches. The lower parts become bleached. </p>
      <p>Two species of <i>Colletotrichum </i>cause anthracnose in
        cannabis. </p>
      <p>Hemp canker, caused by <i>Sclerotinia sclerotiorumi,</i> is
        one of the most important diseases of cannabis. It appears as
        wet lesions on the branches of plants as they mature; the
        lesions become dark cankers. The pith fills with white mycelia.
        Black sclerotia then develop in the stem and in the pith. The
        plants wilt and collapse. The optimal temperature range for its
        growth and maturation of is 24-33<sup>o</sup> C. <i>Sclerotinia</i>
        can be controlled somewhat by proper drainage of the fields. </p>
      <p>Yellow leaf spot is caused by two species of <i>Septoria</i>;
        brown leaf spot is caused by species of <i>Phoma </i>and <i>Ascochyta</i>;
        <i>Phomopsis ganjae </i>causes white leaf spot. </p>
      <p>Severe leaf infections also are caused by strains of <i>Sphaerella


        </i>(stem browning)<i>, Phyllosticta, Cercospora</i>, <i>Microdiplodia,

          Macrosporium cann.</i>, and <i>Pseudoperonospora</i> (olive
        leaf spot), and <i>Didymella arcuata</i>. <b>(32)</b> </p>
      <p><i>Didymella arcuata</i> is found in association with the
        fungus <i>Ascochyta cann.</i> Lasch. The optimal temperature
        for the germination and growth of <i>D. arcuata</i> is 19-26<sup>o</sup>
        C. Its sporulation is promoted by light; its vegetative
        development is stimulated by darkness. <b>(33)</b> </p>
      <p>Leaf spots caused by <i>Cercospora cannabis</i> Hara &amp;
        Fukui are yellow-tan or brown. They are circular at first but
        become irregular and distinct. </p>
      <p><i>Trichothecium roseum</i> causes pink rot on cannabis drug
        cultivars in greenhouses. </p>
      <p>Hemp rust (<i>Melampsora cannabina</i>) appears as orange
        patches on the leaves. It can be controlled by spraying with
        thiocarbamate. </p>
      <p>Bacteriosis (stripe disease) is caused by <i>Pseudomonas
          cannabina </i>Sutic &amp; Dows. var. <i>italica</i> Dows.
        Scattered reddish-violet spots (under 2 mm), surrounded by a
        pale yellow halo, appear on leaf blades, followed by rapid
        shedding. Small necrotic elongate cavities, filled with
        bacteria, appear on the stems. </p>
      <p>Some less common but nonetheless virulent diseases of cannabis
        are anthracnose (<i>Colletotrichum atramentarium</i>) and brown
        blight, which is caused by species of <i>Alternaria</i> and <i>Stemphylium</i>.
      </p>
      <p>Many of the bacterial and fungal diseases of cannabis and other
        crops can be controlled by applications of Bacillus subtilis,
        which is available in several commercial products (i.e,
        Serenade, manufactured by Agraquest). </p>
      <p>Several bacteria that are pathogenic to humans have been found
        on Cannabis, including: <i>Salmonella muenchen</i>, <i>Klebsiella

          pneumoniae</i>, <i>Euterobacter cloacae</i>, <i>E.
          agglomerans</i>, <i>Streptococcus </i>(Group D), <i>Thermoactinomyces

          candidus</i>, <i>T. vulgaris</i>, <i>Micropolyspora faeni</i>,
        <i>Aspergillus fumigatus</i>, <i>A. niger, A. flavus</i>, <i>A.
          tamarri</i>, <i>A. sulphureus</i>, <i>A. repens</i>, <i>Penicillium
          chrysogenum</i>, <i>P. italicum</i>, <i>Rhizopus stolonifer</i>,
        <i>Alternaria alternata</i>, <i>Curvularia lunata</i>, and <i>Histoplasmus
          capsulatum</i>. <i>Aspergillus</i> can be killed by baking
        cannabis at 150<sup>o</sup> C for 15 minutes, but only about 15%
        is destroyed by smoking through a waterpipe. Microbial pathogens
        and toxins, however, are not destroyed by heating or other
        methods of sterilization. </p>
      <p><i><b>Insects</b> --- </i>Several species of mites are
        injurious to stored hempseed: <i>Tyroglyphidae </i>(3 sp.,
        especially <i>T. farinae</i>), <i>Glycyphagidae </i>(6
        species, especially <i>G. destructor</i>), and predaceous <i>Cheyletus

          eruditus</i>. The maximum number of mites are found in
        July-August. <i>T. farinae</i> occurs constantly. Once
        introduced into storage, the mites can persist for several
        years. <i>Tyrophagus </i>can be controlled by treatment of the
        seed with fungitoxic preparations (i.e., Panogen and Aldogen).
        The mechanical damage of hempseed stimulates the breeding of
        mites. The miticide "Cinnamite" (cinnamaldehyde), produced by
        Mycogen, is very effective. <b>(23)</b> </p>
      <p>Spider mites also plague hemp. Their effect is seen as minute
        white spots on the top of leaves. The mites appear as tiny black
        specks on the the underside of leaves. They can be controlled by
        introduction of another mite, <i>Phytoseiulis persimilis</i>. </p>
      <p>The seedlings can be attacked by hemp flea beetles, cutworms
        and white grubs. The stalks and stems can be infested by
        European corn borers and hemp borers, weevils, and by modellid
        and longhorn grubs. The larva of the Death's Head moth (<i>Acherontia
          atropos</i>) occasionally bore into hemp stalks. Flea beetles,
        white root grubs, wireworms, fungus gnats, root maggots,
        termites and ants will attack the roots of cannabis. </p>
      <p>The click beetle (<i>Agriotes mancus</i>), also known as
        wireworm in its juvenile form, infests the top six inches of
        soil and eats the roots of plants, including cannabis. Wireworm
        can be controlled by introduction of beneficial nematodes (<i>Heterohabidis</i>
        and <i>Steinernema</i> spp.). </p>
      <p>Marijuana thrips (<i>Oxythrips cannabensis Knechtel)</i> is a
        sucking insect that is host-specific to hemp. Common thrips (<i>Frankliniella

          occidentalis</i>) eat the calyx of cannabis, causing
        deformation and affecting viability. Thrips can be controlled by
        the predators <i>Amblysieus cucumeris</i>, <i>A. degenerens</i>,
        and <i>Orius tristicolor</i>. The aphid <i>Phorodon cannabis</i>
        Pass. also is found on hemp. </p>
      <p>The tarnished plant bug (<i>Lygus </i>spp.) has been found on
        hemp crops throughout Canada It feeds on the apical meristem,
        which appears malformed and stunted. Brown lesions are visible
        on the stem where the pest has been feeding. It can be
        controlled by the predatory Spined Soldier Bug (<i>Podisus</i>
        spp.). </p>
      <p>The hemp flea beetle (<i>Psylliode attenuata</i>) hibernate in
        the soil until the temperature of the soil and air rises to 10<sup>o</sup>
        C (50<sup>o</sup> F). Then they emerge and feed on leaves and
        stems of seedlings. The pest can be controlled by planting
        &#8216;bait&#8217; hemp with sodium fluosilicate (15 kg/ha) one month before
        the mass planting of the crop. The bait plants are treated again
        after 10 days. This procedure reduces the number of hemp fleas
        by 90%. In rare, extreme cases, methyl parathion can be used
        (50% solution, 8 fluid oz/acre). </p>
      <p>The larvae of hemp borer moths (<i>Grapholita delineana</i>)
        damage the stalks to such extent that the quality does not meet
        the industrial standard. Up to three generations can develop
        each year. The caterpillars live in the stems and flowers of
        female plants, where they damage developing seeds (50% or more).
        After feeding, the caterpillars burrow into the soil and
        overwinter there. In Hungary, where they were first observed,
        the period between August 20 and September 7 (when daylight is
        reduced from 15 to 14 hours) is critical for diapause of the
        larvae. An earlier harvest will prevent the overwintering of
        most of the larvae; thus the population of the next year can be
        considerably reduced. <b>(27)</b> </p>
      <p>The borers can be fought with 50% methyl parathion (20 fl
        oz/acre). After harvesting, the stubble and waste stalks should
        be burned, and the field plowed. Organophosphate insecticides
        are much more effective than organochlorine compounds. Treatment
        methods vary according to the intended use of the crop (fiber or
        seed). Two or three applications of Fenthion (500 gr/ha) are up
        to 98% effective. <b>(28)</b> </p>
      <p>The wasp <i>Trichogramma evanescens</i> Westw. parasitizes the
        eggs of the hemp moth; 80,000-120,000 wasps/ha are released at
        one time. Biological control is more efficacious than of
        chemical methods. Several Hymenoptera species of parasites and
        predators will prey on <i>G. delineana</i>. Commercially
        available Persimilis (<i>Phytoseiulus persimilis</i>) will
        destroy spider mites that infest cannabis (See Appendix 1, #34).
        <b>(29)</b> </p>
      <p>The European corn borer also damages hemp crops. The hemp
        greenfly (<i>Phorodon cannabis</i>) can damage fiber hemp, but
        it has never been a major problem. </p>
      <p>The most common rootknot nematode, <i>Meloidogyne incognita</i>,
        occurs on fiber cultivars of cannabis. The northern rootknot
        nematode (<i>Meloidogyne hapla</i>) has appeared in European
        hemp fields in recent years. Nematodes can be controlled
        somewhat by planting resistant varieties of cannabis, and by
        applications of aqueous extracts of several common plants (i.e.,
        pigweed, marigold, hyssop and mustard). Aqueous urea is very
        effective against nematodes, but it must be buffered to prevent
        damage to the plants. Lesion nematodes (<i>Pratylenchus spp.</i>),
        reniform nematodes (<i>Rotylenchus spp.</i>), and spiral
        nematodes (<i>Helicotylenchus</i> and <i>Scutellonema spp.</i>)
        also have been found in hemp crops. </p>
      <p>The hemp sawfly (<i>Trichiocampus cannabis</i> Xiao et Huang)
        is one of the main pests of hemp in China. The larva feeds on
        hemp leaves, making many holes. It produces two
        generations/year, and the mature larvae overwinter in the soil.
        The sawfly is controlled by Fenitrothion. </p>
      <p>The leaf roller moth (Tortricidae, <i>Grapholitha zinana</i>)
        can damage up to 100% of hemp sowings. The larvae damage the
        infloresences and seed. N. Kozinets, who discovered the pest in
        1964, advised spraying hemp sowing with DDT (15-20 kg/ha) during
        the flight of the adult moth. <b>(30)</b> </p>
      <p>Irrigation too early and continuing humid conditions will
        promote mass attack of hemp stems by <i>Pyraustis nubialis</i>
        Hb. The fiber yield from attacked plants deteriorates by one
        grade. The pest can be controlled by introduction of <i>Trichogramma</i>.
        The number of caterpillars can be reduced by over 60%, and plant
        damage decreased by 80%. <b>(31)</b> </p>
      <p>Cannabis foliage and infloresence possesses phytocidal
        activity. The antibacterial properties are effective against <i>Bacillus

          mesentericus, B. subtilis, B. mycoides, B. cereus, Micrococcus
          albus, M. aureus,</i> and<i> Clostridium welchii</i>. Hemp is
        inactive against <i>Salmonella</i>, <i>Pseudomonas</i>, <i>Azotobacter</i>,
        and<i> Candida</i>. The maximum inhibitory effect from leaf
        extracts occurs in August; the flowers are most potent in
        September, after which time there is a marked decline in
        activity. Phosphate fertilizer promotes the antibacterial
        activity, whereas K- and N-fertilized plants are less active. <b>(34)</b>

      <p><a name="HH28"></a><b>2.8 ~ Nutrients</b> </p>
      <p>The general nutrient requirements of hemp can be satisfied with
        generous applications of manure. Cottonseed is considered to be
        a perfect fertilizer for hemp, and holds moisture and
        mechanically prepares the soil. It is applied at the rate of 500
        to 1,000 lb/acre while plowing in autumn. If the preceding crop
        was soybeans or cowpeas, then 500 lb/acre is sufficient. </p>
      <p>S.S. Boyce gave these recommendations for fertilizing hemp: </p>
      <p>"An application of 200 pounds of bone-meal in November has the
        effect to warm the soil and hasten germination where hemp is
        sown early, and to stimulate the hemp to a quick, early growth,
        before it comes to assimilate the coarser foods, and to give an
        increase of a foot to a foot and a half in growth... </p>
      <p>"Cotton seed and farm manures of equal proportions, with an
        addition of 10% of acid phosphate, [can be] applied according to
        the condition of the soil. The only other addition to the
        compost of 1,000 pounds of cotton seed, 1,000 pounds barn manure
        and 200 pounds of acid phosphate, would be 250 pounds of
        ammonium sulfate [per acre]... This would only be required upon
        old, exhausted cotton lands, while this amount would be
        sufficient for 4 or 5 acres, according to fertility, and for 10
        acres, provided a crop of cowpeas broadcast had preceded." </p>
      <p>Steep-water in which hemp has been retted contains: C (55.66%),
        H (8.21%), N (6.45%), O (29.68%). R. Antoniu, <i>et al.</i>,
        reported that it makes a valuable fertilizer : </p>
      <p>"The wastewaters from hemp retting may be used for irrigation
        without presenting the danger of polluting the phreatic waters
        with organic substances because these substances are nearly
        totally retained on the filtration field. The chloride content
        of the raw wastewater indicates small quantities that could not
        produce the soil salinization after irrigations. In the phreatic
        water below the experimental field, the chloride content is
        10-fold reduced. While the waste water is acid, the water under
        the filtration and irrigated field has a neutral or slightly
        alkaline reaction. Wastewaters were utilized for the irrigation
        of seed corn, silo corn, sugar beet (furrow irrigation), and
        alfalfa. For irrigated seed corn there was an increased
        production (139-143%) in comparison with the non-irrigated. For
        silo corn increases varied between 133-177%, for sugar beet
        between 176-183%, and for alfalfa, 107-416%. For all cultures
        the irrigation norm varied between 2,250-3,550 m<sup>3</sup>/ha."
      </p>
      <p>I. Popescu and I. Afusoae reported this finding from their
        study of retting: </p>
      <p>"Fermentation can help turn hemp boon [hurds] into a suitable
        product for soil fertilization. During fermentation the boon
        reaches almost the same level of assimilable N, K, Mn and Cu as
        in barnyard manure." </p>
      <p>If NPK fertilizers are used, it is necessary to know their
        proper amounts, effects and relationships. These considerations
        are determined by the class of soil in which the crop is grown,
        and the nutrient content of the soil. </p>
      <p>Fertilizers cause changes in basic soil properties and hemp
        yield. N.Gorodnii conducted experiments with this problem. He
        cultivated hemp on two types of loam with 6 variants of
        nutrients (without fertilizers, with 20, 40, and 80 tons
        manure/ha/year, with NPK calculated on 40 tons manure/ha, and
        with N 12:P 90:K 60): </p>
      <p>"With continuous cultivation of hemp on a background of
        ammonium sulfate, superphosphate, and sylvite, the total
        absorbed bases in the soil, the rate of Ca saturation, and the
        nitrification ability were decreased, saturation of the
        absorbing complex by N and NH<sub>4</sub> ions and the exchange
        and hydrolytic acidity of the soil were increased: the physical
        properties of the soil deteriorated, the density increased and
        the percentage of water-resistant aggregates decreased. Applying
        mineral fertilizers during the first years increased the hemp
        seed yield 100%, in comparison with the same doses of manure.
        Application of manure, in comparison with the same doses of
        mineral fertilizers, increased the weight of common hemp 2-3
        fold. <b>" (35)</b> </p>
      <p>The nutrient uptake by cannabis reaches it maximum just before
        maturity and blossoming. Nitrogen and phosphorus uptake then
        increase up to 250%, and potassium requirements increase 400%.
        The uptake of calcium and magnesium increases 150%. Additional
        amounts of nutrients must be readily available to the plants at
        that time in order to produce maximum yields. Hemp consumes
        about 1 kg of nutrients for each kg of fiber it produces. At
        least twice as much nutrients must be available than will be
        removed from the soil by the harvested plants. If hemp is
        field-retted, nearly half of the nutrients&nbsp; are returned to
        the soil. </p>
      <p>The 1897 USDA <i>Year Book</i> listed the amounts of
        fertilizing elements required to produce 100 pounds of hemp
        fibers from 600 lb of plant weight: N (6.27 lb), KOH (10.13 lb),
        H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4 </sub>(3.32 lb). For a yield of 1,500 lb
        of fiber/acre (9,000 lb of growth), the nutrient requirements
        would be: N (94.05 lb), KOH (151.95 lb), and H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>
        (49.8 lb). </p>
      <p>Fertilizer trials conducted on six soil types at the Iowa
        Agricultural Experiment Station (1942-43) gave these results: </p>
      <p>Where N (25 lb/acre), P (50 lb P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>), and
        K (25 lb K<sub>2</sub>O) were applied singly and in
        combinations, average increases in acre yield of dry, rettted
        straw from fertilization ranged from 0.37 to 0.90 ton, P from
        0.12 to 0.80 ton, and K from -0.32 to +0.25 ton N&nbsp; at 100
        lb/acre produced substantial yield increases over N at 25 lb,
        which was not enough for maximum yields. Response to P was
        limited by N deficiency in a number of cases. N-P combinations
        produced higher yields than did either N or P or PK. In general,
        K did not increase hemp yields, [which] were usually highest on
        soil types which contained the greatest quantities of N and
        organic matter, provided drainage was adequate. <b>(36)</b> </p>
      <p>Commercial hemp farmers in the temperate zones of Europe
        generally use a nutrient ratio of 2N:1P:4K. In hot, sunny, and
        tropical climes, hemp uses less potassium, and a ratio of
        2N:1P:2K is more suitable. In areas having a winter or monsoon
        season, more K and less N is required, so the ratio 2N:1P:3K is
        used. </p>
      <p>Other reports state that a high yield of fiber is obtained with
        about 160 kg N, 110 kg P, and 90 kg K per hectare. The highest
        quality bast fiber reportedly is obtained with about 70 kg&nbsp;
        of P and 60 kg of K per hectare, followed by a later dressing of
        90 kg N, 70 kg&nbsp; P, and 60 kg&nbsp; K/ha. This also yields a
        100% increase in fiber content in comparison to other NPK
        ratios. Canadian hemp farmers have applied N at 120 kg/ha, P at
        100 kg/ha, and K at 160 kg/ha. M. Molina, who cultivated hemp
        for 13 years in Italy, stated: </p>
      <p>"Fertilization with 300 kg of ammonium sulfate or 450 kg of
        dried blood, 500 kg&nbsp; superphosphate and 150 kg&nbsp;
        K-sulfate per hectare is recommended." <b>(37)</b> </p>
      <p>Dr. Ivan Bocsa summarized the NPK requirements of hemp thus:
        Class I (rich soil) requires 16-43 lb N/short ton of stalk
        yield, 8-24 lb P/short ton, and 7-24 lb K/short ton. Soil
        Classes II and III require 20-46 lb N/short ton, 14-34 lb
        P/short ton, and 8-27 lb K/short ton. </p>
      <p>G.R. Bedak tested the effectiveness of periodic and annual
        applications of fertilizers in a hemp-hemp and hemp-corn crop
        rotation. The application of P and K fertilizers every two years
        does not affect the quality of fiber, and the cost of storing,
        transporting and applying fertilizers are about 23% less than
        for annual application. <b>(38)</b> </p>
      <p>L. Dobrounof reported these findings from his studies of
        critical periods in the mineral nutrition of hemp: </p>
      <p>"There is a long period during which a given nutrient exerts
        its influence... Beginning when the hemp plant is 6-12 days old,
        it lasts (in relation to the fiber) in male plants 22-28 days
        (i.e., until the beginning of flowering) and in the female
        plants 32-38 days (i.e., until flowering is complete). Within
        the period, there exists a short critical period during which
        the mineral nutrition exerts its greatest influence on the
        direction and intensity of vegetative and reproductive
        development. In male plants this period is 4-5 days before the
        buds are completely formed, while in female plants it is the
        8-10 days at the beginning of flowering. At the beginning of the
        period of effective action is the stage when the plant is
        passing from nutrition at the expense of the seed to independent
        root nutrition. This stage lasts 4-6 days and begins when the
        plants are 6-8 days old. <b>(39)</b> </p>
      <p><b><i>N</i></b>---&nbsp; Approximately 100-150 kg N/ha (and
        80-100 kg P/ha, and 100-180 kg K/ha) is required to obtain 10
        tons of stems/hectare (10 kg N per ton of dry stalk). </p>
      <p>Though the stem yield is high, the quality of fiber decreases
        with increasing amounts of N. Under low-light conditions,
        ammonium sulfate or nitrate stimulates stem growth. The
        absorption of N is most intensive from 20-25 days after
        germination.<b> (40-46)</b> </p>
      <p>Cannabis is nitrophilic, but if the plant is grown for its
        resin, the supply should be kept under 400 ppm, and it must be
        reduced to about 100 ppm during flowering. The application
        of&nbsp; N should be reduced 20% in very hot weather. </p>
      <p>The Russian agronomist B. Lesik showed that the form of N
        substantially affects the growth of hemp and the quality of its
        fiber: </p>
      <p>"When ammonia N was applied, the plants passed through their
        development cycle more rapidly. The stalks were thinner and
        there was less development of wood. In comparison with nitrate
        N, ammonia N caused increases in the yield of long fibers, in
        the length of the elementary fibers, in flexibility, tensile
        strength, and uniformity of the fibers, and cellulose content,
        and there was a decrease in the amount of waste fibers. The
        retting process also proceeded more quickly, and a smaller
        amount of extractive substances (organic acids and N)
        accumulated in the retting fluid. Fertilization with the mixed
        form gave intermediate results. The thinness of the fibers did
        not depend on the form of N applied". <b>(47)</b> </p>
      <p>High N has a "masculinizing" effect on the hemp phenotype; it
        stimulates the formation of male flowers. The proportion,
        degree, and number of monoecious flowers increases with
        increasing N, and the total N content is always higher in
        monoecious plants than in females, whatever the dose of N. <b>(48)</b>
      </p>
      <p>Excessive N causes hemp to grow rapidly as seedlings, but the
        plants wilt, turn to copper-brown, and die when they begin to
        flower. High levels of N in the middle of the growth cycle will
        cause water uptake to increase, and induces a sex ratio as high
        as females 9:1 males. An excess of N is indicated by abnormally
        large, pulpy branches and veins, with few flowers. The stem
        turns brown, and terminal shoots stop developing. Leaves are
        spotted with dead areas, and they curl, pimple, and turn yellow
        between veins. The breaking strength of the fibers is reduced by
        about 15%. The stem texture is herbaceous with a hollow pith and
        short internodes. Excess N added during preparation of the soil
        inhibits stem development. Best results are obtained by adding
        half of the required N in the primary treatment, and the second
        half at the first feeding. </p>
      <p>If the initial growth of a hempfield is slow, it can be aided
        by a foliar spray of 20 kg of urea in 400 liters of water/ha.
        The addition of ammonium sulfate or nitrate with sulfur before
        blooming occurs will increase the growth rate considerably.
        Ammonium nitrate is more effective than the sulfate. Sodium
        nitrate gives good results, but the quality of fiber is poor.
        Cannabis is very sensitive to chlorine; therefore, sulfate salts
        are recommended over chlorides or nitrates. </p>
      <p>A deficiency of N causes the entire hemp plant to turn yellow
        (chlorosis) within a week. Lower leaves curl and shrivel, and
        veins turn purple. Stems are abnormally small and hollow with a
        woody pith. Growth and flowering are retarded, and the plants
        are mostly male. <b>(49)</b> </p>
      <p>K. Tulaikova found bacterial cycles in the N metabolism of
        hemp: </p>
      <p>"The requirements of hemp for abundant nitrogen fertilizers
        were found to be related to the development of numerous and
        diverse rhizobia on its roots, mainly ammonifying bacteria.
        During the germination stage, the bacteria are parasitic because
        they utilize not only the root excretions of plants but partly
        also the plastic matter which is being transported from leaves
        to roots. This is demonstrated by the weak development of the
        root during the first half of the growth period. If N feed is
        abundant, the relations between the hemp and bacteria are
        symbiotic... Simultaneous feeding on nitrates by both root
        bacteria and hemp induces N deficiency in the plants. Therefore,
        nitrate fertilizers are especially required for hemp
        development... An improvement in N status observed after
        bacterization with silica bacteria was probably due to the
        ability of the latter to fix atmospheric N." <b>(50)</b> </p>
      <p>There are differences in the root microflora of hemp according
        to sex. Ammonifying&nbsp; and denitrifying bacteria which
        decompose organic P predominate on the roots of females, and
        greatly depend on the food reserves in the soil. Deficiency of
        soil nutrients increases the concentration of microbes on the
        roots; thus the number of ammonifying bacteria is much less on
        the roots of hemp grown in rich soil than in the roots of plants
        grown in exhausted soil. Silicate bacteria predominate on male
        roots, which absorb N and K more vigorously than the female up
        to the flowering phase. <b>(51)</b> </p>
      <p><b><i>P</i></b> --- Hemp growth, fiber yield, and concentration
        of THC are positively correlated with extractable phosphate.
        Cannabis uses 250% more phosphorus at flowering than during the
        vegetative phase. A deficiency of P shows as abnormally dark
        dull green leaves with a purple tint on the underside, and
        downward-curled margins. The stem gradually turns reddish, then
        black. The roots are long, with few laterals. The plants are
        slow to mature and set seed. </p>
      <p>P. Gorshkov studied the peculiarities of P nutrition for hemp:
      </p>
      <p>"To obtain high yields of hemp, it is necessary to assure the
        plants an easily accessible source of phosphoric acid by
        applying granulated superphosphate at the very beginning of
        development, before the plants have reached the phase of 6 pairs
        of leaves. At later phases of development the requirement for P
        may be met by soil P and by less soluble forms of P fertilizer."
        <b>(52)</b> </p>
      <p>The Russian agronomist M. Khann confirmed the beneficial effect
        of superphosphate drilled in with hemp seeds: </p>
      <p>"This method allowed for a 3-fold decrease of the
        superphosphate without lowering of the productivity. The
        increase in the yield of fiber obtained from 1 kg P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>
        drilled in with the seeds exceeded by 3-6 times the
        corresponding increases from broadcasting 1 kg P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>.
        The corresponding seed yield increase was 3.5-4.7 times higher."
        <b>(53)</b> </p>
      <p><b><i>K </i></b>---&nbsp; Either potassium sulfate or potash
        is recommended over KCl because the chloride ion interferes with
        fiber development. The combination of potash with manure
        increases yields up to 30%, and increases the availability of
        phosphorus by almost 200%. A combination of potash, Mg-sulfate
        and manure produces the greatest yield, increasing with higher
        levels of Mg. Potash strengthens the stalk and stems and
        increases the resistance of hemp to broom rape. The absorption
        of K is most intense in the 4th week after germination. </p>
      <p>Additional K increases plant height, thickens the stem, and
        produces heavy, large, dark green leaves. The growth cycle is
        shortened by about one week, and the sex ratio is stabilized at
        about females 7:3 males. An excess of K after the 10th week, or
        when flowering occurs, will delay maturity and inhibit resin
        production. White spots appear on leaves, meristematic growth
        ceases, and the stem is woody and hollow. When cannabis is
        cultivated for resin, the supply of K should be reduced by 50%
        during flowering. </p>
      <p>I. Berzak reported these results of his experiments on the
        effect of various K fertilizers on the yield and quality of hemp
        fibers: </p>
      <p>"The highest yields of stems and fibers were obtained with
        kalimag (K-sulfate/Magnesia/Mg-sulfate), and with
        K-chloride/K-sulfate mixture, whereas the lowest was obtained
        with kainite (K-chloride/Mg-sulfate). Male hemp responded to K
        fertilizers much more than female hemp". <b>(54)</b> </p>
      <p>Potassium deficiency is indicated by coppery mottling and
        curled, grey edges or a brown margin on leaves, followed by dark
        spots and bleaching between the veins. The symptoms first appear
        on bottom leaves. Old foliage turns dark gray, and new leaves
        turn yellow and die. Growth is retarded, and the roots and
        apical meristems turn pale yellow. The stem is herbaceous, and
        hollow in males, while females are solid. Deficiency can occur
        in acidic soil or in low-light conditions. The addition of a
        little detergent will increase the wetness of the nutrient
        solution and allow K to be more easily absorbed. </p>
      <p>When K is deficient, transpiration is reduced, but water
        consumption is increased, especially in young plants. A
        deficiency of K decreases the yields of stems and fiber, but
        contributes the formation of strong, elastic fibers. <b>(55)</b>
      </p>
      <p><b><i>Ca</i></b> --- Calcium gives cannabis very strong,
        fibrous, short stems with dark green leaves and swollen flowers.
        An adequate supply is vital in the 6th-9th weeks of growth. The
        largest absorption of Ca is made possible when calcium carbonate
        is applied together with small doses of humus. <b>(56)</b> </p>
      <p>Calcium-deficient plants are stunted, weak and flabby. Terminal
        buds die, and the stem becomes brittle and covered with dark
        areas. Upper leaves are darker than usual, yellow at the edges,
        and they crinkle, dry up, and fall off. Any new leaves that form
        will die. Brown and white spots appear on lower leaves. </p>
      <p>Excessive Ca will stunt the early growth of cannabis, and
        causes terminal shoots to be weak and under-developed. Foliage
        is less abundant, and blackening occurs around the veins. The
        stems are fibrous and woody, with a hollow pith. The sex ratio
        changes to males 7:3 females. </p>
      <p>Calcium affords plants considerable resistance to infection
        with <i>Botrytis</i>; the higher the level of calcium, the
        lower the incidence of <i>Botrytis</i>. </p>
      <p><b><i>Trace Elements </i></b>--- Micronutrient deficiencies
        often are caused by alkaline water, which prevents uptake by
        plants. Such deficiencies usually can be covered by the use of
        commercially available "transplanting solutions" and by
        adjusting the soil to neutral pH. </p>
      <p><b><i>Mg</i></b> --- Cannabis is very sensitive to magnesium
        deficiency, which is likely to occur in sandy soils and during
        seasons of heavy rainfall. Chlorosis begins on the bottom
        leaves. Grey-white patches, varicose veins, and yellow margins
        appear on the leaves, which curl and die on the edges. Growth is
        stunted, the stem is thin, and leaves drop off. The stem texture
        of males is woody, and females are herbaceous. The pith is
        hollow. A deficiency can be corrected with Mg-phosphate and
        brine (1 quart per 100 lb of compost), or with Epsom salts. </p>
      <p>Hemp has an extraordinarily high requirement for Mg, and is
        exceptional in comparison to most other plants, which are killed
        by applications of Mg alone. Combinations of K and Mg give the
        highest yields, which increase considerably with an increase in
        the Mg.<b> (57)</b> </p>
      <p>A. Haraszty conducted experiments for 10 years to augment the
        yield of hemp fiber with macro- and micronutrients (tested in
        over 50 combinations). He found significant effects with
        formulations containing K, Mn and Mg (applied in the form of
        their sulfates at 10 kg/ha), by which he achieved up to 32%
        increases in fiber quantity. The combination of K and Mn gave a
        17% increase. <b>(58)</b> </p>
      <p><b><i>Fe</i></b> ---&nbsp; The symptoms of iron deficiency are
        the same as for magnesium, but they appear on the upper leaves
        first. Acidic soils dissolve and chelate iron, making it
        unavailable to plants. Powdered magnetite (magnetic iron oxide)
        will supply sufficient Fe, and it stimulates plant growth by the
        effect of magnetic energy. 10 ppm of Fe gives the best growth of
        hemp fiber; 5 ppm gives the best yield of cannabinoids. </p>
      <p>C. Olsen studied Fe absorption by hemp in hydroponic beds: </p>
      <p>"When hemp is cultured in solutions low in Ca and with
        Fe-sulfate as Fe source, increasing growth inhibition due to Fe
        intoxication is observed when the pH of the solution decreases
        from 6 to 4. This is due to the fact that the ferric ion
        concentration in the solution increases greatly when the pH is
        lowered to 4. The same is true in soil. Even so, hemp can
        develop quite normally in solution of pH 4 provided the Ca ion
        concentration is high, resulting in a sufficient lowering of the
        rate of Fe absorption to preclude intoxication. This
        antagonistic situation does not occur in nature since soil of
        low pH and high Ca concentration does not exist." <b>(59)</b> </p>
      <p><b><i>Mn </i></b>---&nbsp; A deficiency of manganese will
        stunt the growth and flowering of hemp. Leaves appear mottled
        with grey-brown necrotic spots. The plants lack vitamin C; there
        are some deaths. Signs of deficiency first appear on shoots.
        Leaf margins remain green while the rest of the leaf turns
        yellow or white. </p>
      <p><b><i>S </i></b>--- Sulfur stimulates root growth and seed
        production. S-deficient hemp is pale green, with purple veins.
        The stem is stiff, woody, and thin; the seeds are immature. </p>
      <p><b><i>B </i></b>--- Hemp requires 250 grams of boron per acre.
        When sufficient P and K are available, an additional application
        of boric acid (1 kg/ha), Cu-sulfate (1 kg/ha), and Mn-sulfate
        (10 kg/ha) will produce a significant increase in yields and in
        the quality of fiber and seeds. A deficiency of B is revealed by
        cracked, stunted stems and dry rot. Leaves turn purple, terminal
        shoots curl and die, petioles become brittle, and the flowers
        are covered with dry areas. New shoots turn gray or brown and
        die with a burnt appearance. The situation can be corrected with
        a foliar spray of boric acid. </p>
      <p><b><i>Cu</i></b> --- Cannabis does not have a high tolerance
        for copper, but supplementary Cu-sulfate will improve the
        quality and yield of hemp, especially in peat, which often is
        deficient in this element. A deficiency causes stems to weaken
        and break. Treatment of a field with 10 kg/yoke (1.42 acres)
        will increase the fiber bundle diameter up to 15%; when the Cu
        is combined with cobalt, the bundle diameter will increase up to
        23%. </p>
      <p><b><i>Mo</i></b> --- A deficiency of molybdenum is indicated by
        yellowing between veins on leaves. The middle leaves turn
        yellow. </p>
      <p><b><i>Zn</i></b> --- A deficiency of zinc is indicated by
        chlorosis between the veins at the base of shoots, and by the
        accompanying twist of leaf blades. Flowering is inhibited. </p>
      <p>Over-watering produces symptoms resembling nutrient
        deficiencies or excesses. These usually can be corrected by
        reducing the water supply, or by drainage. </p>

        (1) genotype, (2) photoperiod, (3) N-P-K, (4) at least 60-80 cm
        separation between plants, and (5) "optimal temperature of the
        ground at the time of sowing". Resin production is minimal at 44<sup>o</sup>
        F (See also <b>2.5</b> and <b>2.10</b>). </p>
      <p>The production of cannabinoids (THC, CBN, CBD, etc.) is greatly
        influenced by nutrients. As soil N increases relative to Mg, CBD
        increases relative to CBN. Increasing<b> </b>the ratio of N to
        Cu increases the level of CBD. Increasing amounts of P convert
        CBN to THC. Low to medium levels of P produces a high level of
        CBD, but CBD decreases with high levels of P. Low levels (levels
        less than 40 ppm) of&nbsp; Mg produce more CBD than do high
        levels of Mg. As levels of Mg increase relative to Ca, the
        concentration of THC decreases. The concentration of Mg and Fe
        in leaves is positively correlated to THC levels. Potassium
        increases the concentration of CBN by effecting the
        dehydrogenation of THC. An excess of K in the 3rd month will
        inhibit resin production. Excess Ca will inhibit resin
        production, and it increases the production of CBD in the resin
        is produced. Either an excess or deficiency of Mg produces more
        CBD. 5 ppm Fe gives highest yields of THC. </p>
      <p>The recommended "ideal" pattern of nutrient application for
        cannabinoid production is said to be: high N and K, low Ca, and
        medium Mg during the first 2 months of growth, continued high N
        and K, medium Mg, and increased Ca during the next 6-8 weeks,
        followed by decreased N, K, and Ca, and increased Mg through the
        flowering phase. Many growers use a commercial 15-30-30 formula
        throughout the season. </p>
      <p>Mel Frank offers this micronutrient formula for high
        cannabinoid production: Fe-sulfate (5 mg/gal), Cu-sulfate (0.2
        mg/gal), Mn-sulfate (2 mg/gal), Zn-sulfate (0.2 mg/gal), Boric
        acid (2 mg/gal), Molybdenic acid (0.1 mg/gal). Use 1 tspn/gal of
        nutrient solution, once monthly. </p>
      <p>Bill Drake gives this recipe in <i>Marijuana: The Cultivator&#8217;s
          Handbook</i>: Ca-sulfate (6 oz), mono-Ca-phosphate (4 oz),
        Mg-sulfate (6 oz), K-nitrate (8 oz), and Fe-sulfate (1 gr). Use
        1 tspn/gal. </p>
      <p>Many marijuana growers reportedly use a commercial 15-30-30 NPK
        mixture successfully throughout the growing season. </p>
      <p>Since the 1960s, marijuana farmers have developed many special
        techniques to camouflage their operations and to enhance the
        production of psychoactive resin. Such cultivators grow the
        plant for its flowers rather than the fiber. They prefer to grow
        females because they produce more resin than males. The female
        is much larger and more vigorous than the male, which does not
        produce much foliage and dies soon after dispersing its pollen.
        What little resin the male does produce is, however, about as
        potent as that of the female, and it can be worth extracting and
        isomerizing. If the female is kept virgin so that seed
        production is prevented, it develops more flowers and more resin
        with greater potency. The mature virgin plant is called
        "sensimilla" (without seeds). For these reasons, the males are
        removed as soon as they can be identified.The cultivation of <i>bhang

        </i>(cannabis) is a highly ritualized process in India. Select
        seeds are kept in the mouth of a dead snake until they are sown
        under the waxing moon in July. Often a freshly-killed snake
        (preferably a cobra) is buried under the plants, for it is&nbsp;
        believed that the venom potentizes the resin. The rites of <i>nyasa</i>
        and <i>acamana</i> are performed while facing north or east.
        Water is mixed with milk and sprinkled over the seeds. When they
        sprout, water mixed with clarified butter is used. When the
        first leaves appear, the plants are sprinkled with salt water.
        During flowering, the plants are sprinkled with water mixed with
        alcohol and meat, then with water and honey, and finally with
        water and alcohol. The rites of <i>stapana</i>, <i>sevana</i>,
        <i>tantubandhana</i>, and <i>lavana</i> are performed before
        the harvest. The rite of <i>tantubandhana</i> should be
        performed by a&nbsp; purified person on the 14th day of the
        waning moon (in February-March in India). The plants are tied
        with red, yellow, black and white threads. The <i>Aghora mantra</i>
        should be recited for a week. On the 5th day of the waxing moon,
        the cultivator meditates on the <i>bhang</i> and imagines her
        as a deity. When the seeds are fat, the plants are harvested
        while reciting the <i>Aghora mantra</i>. </p>
      <p>Cultivators of<i> bhang</i> often hire a <i>poddar</i> to
        inspect the plants and cull the males before flowering begins.
        In many districts of India, farmers stick a knife through the
        stem near the base of the plant and insert a wedge or nail.
        Sometimes opium, mercury, sulfur, arsenic, or asafetida is
        stuffed into the crack to increase the potency of the plant.
        Certainly, the use of mercury or arsenic is not to be
        recommended. </p>
      <p>Indoor crops can be induced to flower by reducing the
        photoperiod to under 12 hours for 2 weeks. When the plants have
        flowered, the males can be culled, and the photoperiod is
        increased again to resume vegetative growth, but overall
        development is slightly delayed by this procedure. </p>
      <p>Breeders now recognize that the content and quality of hemp
        fiber is not related to the quantity of psychoactive
        cannabinoids. Certain varieties are rich in both THC and fiber.
      </p>
      <p><i><b>Pruning </b>---</i> Many cultivators insist that
        Cannabis grows best if it is left untouched. Others argue that
        judicious pruning not only alters the appearance of the plant,
        but also increases the amount of foliage. </p>
      <p>The lower limbs or their leaves can be pruned to make more
        energy available to the upper flowers (This interferes somewhat
        with metabolic processes by reducing photosynthesis). The large,
        non-floral foliage also shades the ground, thus conserving
        water. </p>
      <p>Removal of the central bud will produce a multi-stem plant with
        more foliage. After the plant has produced at least three sets
        of leaves, carefully cut the central bud (apical meristem). The
        two remaining axial shoots will develop as stems. These two
        stems also can be pruned in this manner when they have developed
        sufficiently. The result is a relatively low, bushy plant. The
        technique should be used only on young plants; late pruning will
        interfere with flower development. </p>
      <p>Stems and branches also can be trained with a trellis, or tied
        down close to the ground so as to present a low profile, quite
        unlike normal Cannabis. </p>
      <p><b><i>Grafting ---- </i></b>The Humulus hops plant looks
        nothing like cannabis, and it can be grafted onto hemp, and it
        will produce cannabinoids. The technique is not considered to be
        very practical. <b>(60)</b> </p>
      <p>I. Bocsa and G. Farkas tested the influence of the slip upon
        the longevity of root-stock with grafts with hemp varieties with
        different longevities and between individuals of the same
        variety/different sex: </p>
      <p>"The graft can influence the lifespan of the rootstock. A graft
        with greater longevity will increase (independently of the sex
        relationships) the life span of the root-stock. Female slips,
        which have a longer vegetation period than the males, will
        increase the life span of the male root-stock." <b>(61)</b> </p>
      <p><b><i>Cloning</i></b> --- C. Richez-Dumanois, <i>et al</i>.,
        studied the <i>in vitro</i> propagation of hemp clones, thus: </p>
      <p>"Morphological and chemical development decreased at low
        temperature and were promoted by a regime of 22<sup>o</sup> C
        (daily temperature) and 17<sup>o</sup> C (night) under 24 hour
        illumination and 70% relative humidity. Shoot proliferation was
        obtained with the addition of cytokinin (BAP, 5.10<sup>7</sup>
        M/liter) and auxin (AIB, 10<sup>7</sup> M/l.). The axillary
        shoots which developed were used as mother-plants in vitro; they
        provided numerous cuttings after repeated sub-culturing on the
        same medium. A long thinning stage was necessary for rooting the
        microcuttings in the presence of charcoal (2 gr/l.) and AIB (10<sup>5</sup>
        M). The best method for rooting in vivo shoots involved
        non-aseptic conditions (3-4 weeks). The further growth of plants
        at 22<sup>o</sup> C/17<sup>o</sup> C was comparable to that of
        corresponding horticultural cuttings and the cannabinoid pattern
        was similar to that of mother-plants". <b>(62)</b> </p>
      <p>V. Sustrina cloned hemp as a method of obtaining starting
        material for selection: </p>
      <p>" The best method for the intervarietal grafting of hemp is
        considered to be by fork grafts of material in the cotyledon
        phase onto hosts of 7-8 pairs of true leaves... A most promising
        method is to graft female hemp on males and selfing. The best
        results were given by the used of female hemp as the host and
        pollinating the graft with Kavkavskaya hemp." </p>

      <p><b>2.10&nbsp;<a name="HH210"></a> ~ Growth Stimulants</b> </p>
      <p>The B-vitamins (1 ppm solution) increase the yield of hempseed
        and its fat content, but somewhat suppresses the growth of
        leaves, stems, and seed hulls. Potassium permanganate in weak
        solutions stimulates the development of cannabis in all its
        phases. Dilute camphor also stimulates plant growth. Vitamin C
        (1-5 parts in 10,000 water) has the same effect. </p>
      <p>The ripening of cannabis flowers can be accelerated by addition
        of a tablespoon of sugar per gallon of nutrient solution. Do not
        use this treatment during the initial stages of the flowering
        cycle, because flowering will be delayed instead. </p>
      <p>Auxigro, manufactured by the Auxein Corp. (Lansing, MI; <a
          href="http://www.auxein.com;/">www.auxein.com;</a> US Patent
        5,840,656) contains 4-aminobutyric acid, L-glutamic acid, etc.).
        It increases fertilizer efficiency severalfold and improves
        plant growth up to 50%. Nutrient accumulation also is increased
        dramatically. </p>
      <p>Triacontanol is a fatty alcohol found in many plants. It
        increases growth rates and yields up to 25%, and increases the
        protein content, even during darkness when plants usually are
        dormant. Triacontanol seems to enhance the growth of plants
        without increasing their consumption of nitrogen. The simplest
        way to use triacontanol is to plow under a crop of alfalfa,
        which contains relatively large amounts of the substance.
        Triacontanol is extracted from sunflower seeds or alfalfa by
        chloroform; filter and evaporate the solution to yield crude
        triacontanol. The dosage is 1 ppm in water. </p>
      <p><b><i>Carbon Dioxide</i></b> --- Plants utilize atmospheric
        carbon dioxide to supply their carbon. The current level of
        atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> is about 350 ppm. If the level of CO<sub>2</sub>in
        a closed growing space decreases to below 200 ppm, growth will
        cease. Levels above 2% can be injurious to both plants and
        animals. When cannabis is cultivated indoors, the rate of growth
        and photosynthesis can be enhanced by increasing the
        concentration of carbon dioxide to about 0.2%. The effects are
        most influential in the second month of growth. The rate of
        growth can be increased about 50% by increasing the level of CO<sub>2</sub>
        to about 700 ppm. If the level is increased to 1,500 ppm during
        the vegetative phase, the growth rate will increase up to 80%.
        The number of females also increases slightly under the
        influence of CO<sub>2</sub>. When extra CO<sub>2</sub> is
        supplied during the flowering phase, the flowers will mature
        about 2 weeks sooner, and they will increase in weight about
        20%. </p>
      <p>To calculate the amount of CO<sub>2</sub> required to enrich a
        growroom, first select the level of CO<sub>2 </sub>you desire
        (assuming 300 ppm atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>). Multiply the
        cubic feet of the grow space with the corresponding factor
        (given below) to determine how many cubic feet of gas are needed
        to raise the level for each cycle of enrichment. The cycle is
        repeated as the plants absorb the gas or it is vented outdoors
        (necessarily when the room temperature rises to 85<sup>o</sup>
        F). Commercially available equipment will do this automatically.
      </p>
      <p>For 1,000 ppm, factor (.0007) x cubic feet to determine the
        requisite volume of gas. 1,100 ppm = (.0008); 1,200 ppm =
        (.0009); 1,300 ppm = (.0010); 1,400 ppm = (.0011); 1,500 ppm =
        (.0012). </p>
      <p><b><i>Gibberellin </i></b>--- When seeds absorb water, the
        hormone gibberellin (gibberellic acid-A, GAA) appears in the
        embryo and activates the metabolism to initiate sprouting. GAA
        has been widely tested in applications to hemp. </p>
      <p>When applied to cannabis at a rate of 100 ppm in water for 2
        months, GAA increases the thickness and internodal length of the
        stock. The terminal nodes are weak, branching is suppressed, and
        the roots develop poorly. Germination is stimulated by GAA, but
        leaf growth and the production of chlorophyll and cannabinoids
        are reduced proportionately. GAA treatment does not hasten the
        generative development of hemp, but does promote plant growth.
        The stem diameter increases about 250% over control plants, and
        the fresh weight of the stem increases 300%. Treated plants have
        a higher ratio of bark:wood. The number of fibers increases up
        to 100%. </p>
      <p>According to G. Davidyan, the greatest effect is achieved with
        0.005-0.01% GAA applied before the buds form. </p>
      <p>R. Herich tested the histological reactions of hemp by soaking
        the seeds in 5 ppm GAA for 24 hours with these results: </p>
      <p>"The plants showed the following differences from untreated
        controls: decrease of stem thickness, less lignification,
        decreased bark development especially in lower parts of stems,
        decrease in number of secondary bast fibers, increase in number
        and size of primary bast fibers, and increased differentiation
        of parenchymatous pith tissue". <b>(63)</b> </p>
      <p>C.K. Atal also described the effect of GAA on hemp: </p>
      <p>"Gibberellin-treated plants showed a greater number of fibers
        as compared to controls. The individual fibers were larger in
        diameter, more lignified, and up to 10 times as long as the
        fibers from the untreated plants." <b>(64)</b> </p>
      <p>F. Yanishevskii studied the effect of GAA on the nitrogen
        metabolism of hemp: </p>
      <p>"Stem lengthening took place mainly by cell extension. Net
        weight even decreased somewhat. Chlorophyll concentration
        decreased noticeably... Plants treated with GAA contained less N
        than controls. GAA exerted a considerable influence on the N
        metabolism of hemp plants: in treated plants the amount of
        protein N decreased 2-fold, but, in contrast, the soluble forms
        of N increased markedly. Treatment with GAA had almost no effect
        on the content of N fractions of cell components (nuclei,
        plastids). Nucleic acid content decreased mainly owing to
        decrease in the amount of RNA. Accumulation of soluble forms of
        N under the influence of GAA would indicate that the
        introduction of nitrogenous fertilizers (as recommended by
        Witter and Bucovac) would hardly make up for the unfavorable
        effect of GAA on the N metabolism of hemp." <b>(65)</b> </p>
      <p>N. Yakushkina and L. Chuikova also tested the action of GAA and
        Indole-Acetic Acid (IAA, auxin) on hemp: </p>
      <p>"GAA intensified the growth of the plants, the average dry
        weight per plant, the photosynthesis rate, the sugar content
        (especially of the stem) and that of total N, and the
        respiration rate, but decreased the content of chlorophyll in
        the leaves. The separate application of IAA caused a decrease in
        the growth and yield of the plants, and a considerable increase
        in the chlorophyll content, but decreased the photosynthesis
        rate. The simultaneous application of GAA and IAA was
        accompanied by the highest increase in yield, but this addition
        of IAA did not exert any substantial influence on the
        physiological processes.<b>" (66 )</b> </p>
      <p>GAA also increases the length of the growing season. GAA will
        inhibit the formation of flowers on Cannabis; it must not be
        used during the flowering phase of growth. GAA will accelerate
        the <u>onset</u> of budding by about 7 days. </p>
      <p>Treatment of plants with 25 mg GAA/liter results in 80% of the
        plants being male. Female hemp usually undergoes sex reversal to
        a male expression, but few of the male plants produce female
        flowers. Thus, G. Davidyan and S. Kutuzova reported: </p>
      <p>"Gibberellin causes the formation of male flowers, containing
        fertile pollen, on genetically female plants." <b>(67)</b> </p>
      <p>V. Khryanin treated dioecious hemp with GAA (25 mg/liter) and
        produced monoecious feminized staminate hemp from the common
        pistillate form: </p>
      <p>"Gibberellin, as a hormone of the plant organism, probably
        depresses genes which participate in the formation of flowers
        which have been repressed. </p>
      <p>"Thus GAA can be used by breeders to develop monoecious
        cannabis from dioecious forms. Preliminary tests are necessary
        to determine the most effective concentration and best timing
        for each cultivar." </p>
      <p>Gibberellin is extracted from cucumber seeds, fresh cantelope
        seeds, dried corn kernels, and from pencil rod, lupine, and
        pinto beans. Soak 200 grams of powdered seeds in 110 ml of a
        mixture of acetone (10 parts), isopropyl alcohol (5 p), ethanol
        (2 p), and water (5 p). Filter the mush and rinse it with 20 ml
        acetone and 20 ml isopropyl alcohol. Combine the rinse and the
        mother liquor, then evaporate the solvent. Dissolve the gum in
        alkaline water for experimental use. </p>
      <p>The effect of GAA is removed by abscisic acid (ABA), which will
        initiate flowering. Treatment of plants with ABA (10 mg/liter)
        results in all plants being female or bisexual. The ABA can be
        overcome by increasing the concentration of GAA. <b>(68)</b> </p>

      <p><b>2.11<a name="HH211"></a> ~ Harvest</b> </p>
      <p>Hemp is ready to harvest after the males have shed their
        pollen. If hemp is harvested before the males die, then the
        retting of both male and female plants together is more uniform.
        The harvest period can extend 2 weeks, but late hemp is more
        lignified. An early harvest may produce fine, soft fiber, but
        usually it is weak. </p>
      <p>Belgian farmers traditionally harvested their hemp on St.
        Madelin's Day (July 22). On that occasion they would chant,
        "Harvest your hemp on St. Madelin's Day. If it's not ready, bale
        it for another week." </p>
      <p>According to the experience gained by Canadian hemp farmers in
        1998, the crop should be direct-combined when seed moisture
        reaches 25-30%, and the wet seed should be aerated within 24
        hours after combining. </p>
      <p><b><i>Yield --- </i></b>The USDA reported that an acre of hemp
        usually yields an average of about 7 tons of green stalks. After
        drying and curing in shocks, the stalks weigh about 5 tons.
        After retting and drying, the stalks weigh about 3 tons, and
        they yield about 750 lb of long, rough fiber. The yield of hurds
        is about 2.5 tons/acre. After hackling, the yield is about 350
        lb of single-dressed line fiber, 170 lb of short fiber, and 90
        lb of hurds and waste. </p>
      <p>Research conducted by Dr. H.M.G. van der Werf showed that fiber
        hemp yields can be increased by about 30% by growing very
        late-flowering cultivars at a relatively low density (&lt;300
        plants /m<sup>2</sup>). The crop self-thins due to inter-plant
        competition, and it is harvested late in September. </p>
      <p>According to Dr. Ivan Bocsa, the stalk yield of hemp for Class
        I&nbsp; (rich) soil is &lt;2.7 to &gt;3.8 short tons/acre. The
        lower quality Class II and III soils yield &lt;1.8 to &gt;2.9
        short tons/acre. </p>
      <p>The Hungarian dioecious variety Kompolti, which currently has
        the highest fiber content in the world, produces yields of about
        9 tons stems/hectare. The Polish varieties Beniko and
        Bialobrzerzie produce about 100 kg seed/ha, plus 9-10 tons of
        dry stalks/ha. The varieties mature in late September. Ukranian
        seed such as Zolotonosha and Glukiv USO have been tested in
        Manitoba and Ontario, Canada. They&nbsp; have vegetative periods
        of 110-150 days and yield 0.25-0.5 tons seed/acre and 3.25-5
        tons of stalk/acre. In Australia, the yields of stalks average
        from 8-10 tons/ha; in the Ukraine, 8-10 tons/ha; in the
        Netherlands, 10-14 tons/ha; in the UK, 5-7 tons/ha. The low
        average is about 6 tons of stalk/ha, yielding a low of 22% bast
        fiber. The high yield is about 10 tons of stalk/ha, with a high
        content of 30% bast fiber; thus, yields range from 1.3-3.0 tons
        of fiber/ha. </p>
      <p>Thomas Jefferson simply noted the following regarding the yield
        of hemp: </p>
      <p>"Tolerable ground yields 500 lb to the acre. You may generally
        count on 100 lb for every foot the hemp is over 4 ft high." </p>
      <p>S.S. Boyce (<i>Hemp</i>, 1900) stated likewise: </p>
      <p>"Hemp yields 150 pounds of fiber per acre for each foot in
        height, hence the advantage of a tall plant." </p>
      <p><b><i>Equipment</i></b> --- The World War Two film <i>Hemp for
          Victory!</i> showed farmers the best equipment then available
        to harvest the crop: </p>
      <p>"Hemp grows so luxuriently in Kentucky that harvesting is
        sometimes difficult, which may account for the popularity of the
        self-rake with its lateral stroke. A modified rice binder has
        used to some extent. This machine works well on average hemp...
        An improved hemp harvester... spreads the hemp in a continuous
        swath... In Kentucky, hand cutting is used to open fields for
        the machine. [The] hemp is shucked as soon as safe, after
        cutting, to be spread for retting later in the fall. </p>
      <p>"In Wisconsin, hemp is harvested in September. Here the
        harvester with automatic spreader is standard equipment. Note
        how smoothly the rotating apron lays the swaths preparatory to
        retting. Here it is a common and essential practice to leave
        headlands around hemp fields. These strips may be planted with
        other crops, preferably small grain. Thus the harvester has room
        to make its first round without preparatory hand cutting... When
        the cutter bar is much shorter than the hemp is tall,
        overlapping occurs. Not so good for retting. The standard cut is
        8 to 9 feet... </p>
      <p>"When conditions are favorable, the pickup binder is commonly
        used. The swaths should lie smooth and even with the stalks
        parallel. The picker won&#8217;t work well in tangled hemp. After
        binding, hemp is shucked as soon as possible to stop further
        retting. </p>
      <p>"A helper with a hooked pole may be required to pull out
        problematic "volunteer" stalks, which are difficult to cut.
        Volunteer hemp grows from seeds scattered by the previous crop.
        Such seed sprouts earlier than sown hempseed and grows taller
        than the rest of the crop." </p>
      <p>When hemp grows to a height of 15 ft or more, a self-rake
        combined reaper and mower works well. Modified rice binders also
        have been used to bundle hemp. A sweep-rake reaper can cut 5
        acres or more in a day, and a mowing machine can harvest 7 to 10
        acres. The British Hemcore project used a modified rape swather
        and round balers. French farmers have reported using modified
        silage maize harvesters. In the French method of harvesting for
        seed, a combine harvester is used to cut the upper parts of
        plants, but the cutter bar must be raised to its maximum heigh
        (about 180 cm). At this height, some fiber yield is lost because
        more than the seed-bearing portion of the stem is removed. Good
        timing is of vital importance, but efficiency is low because the
        seed does not mature uniformly. If the hemp is dual-purpose
        crop, the fiber can be contaminated with seed and foliage, some
        stems will be lost under the wheels, and field-drying may not be
        feasible due to the lateness of the season. After harvesting the
        seed, the remaining stem can be cut with a finger mower. A
        narrow draper-style windrower cannot handle tall hemp, but a
        wide draper or auger windrow may be satisfactory. </p>
      <p>The Dutch Hemp Research Programme (DHRP, 1990-1994) cut its
        hemp with a mower conditioner. The crop was field-dried at least
        4 days to reduce the moisture content below 15% so as to avoid
        the decay of fiber by bacteria during the storage of dry hemp.
        Because of erratic weather conditions, field drying is not a
        reliable practice in Europe. The seed was harvested by cutting
        off the stem tops and threshing them with a combine. The stalks
        were round-baled. Minor problems caused by pickup blockages can
        be avoided by reducing the windrow volume and ground speed. </p>
      <p>The DHRP also developed a new method of &#8220;direct harvesting&#8221;
        using field choppers equipped with a row-independent header. The
        operation loosens about 90% of the core and bark, but the
        sharpness of the chopper knives and the throughput of the stalks
        causes problems with wrapping and blocking. Field chopping is
        advantageous in that the stalks are not dried in the field; the
        pieces are immediately stored in a silo, thus avoiding the
        vagaries of weather. The maturation and harvest periods can be
        extended, and the labor is reduced considerably. </p>
      <p>In their review of the hemp harvest and storage techniques
        developed by the DHRP, Huisman and de Maeyer concluded: </p>
      <p>"With decortication, the bark could not be cleaned well enough
        and still contained more than 40% of the core. Bark and loose
        core should be easily separable by sieving since the size of the
        bark [0.5-2.5 cm] and of the loose pieces [1-8 cm] greatly
        differ... It was clear that the quantity of fixed core mainly
        depended on stem diameter; the smaller the diameter, the higher
        the quantity of fixed core... </p>
      <p>"With field chopping, the bark was not cut as short as the
        hurds; this made it possible to separate bark and core by
        sieving or flotation. Sieving of chopped hemp resulted in a
        "contamination rate" of both bark and core of about 25%... The
        size difference between the chopped bark and core was not big
        enough to separate them by sieving. With flotation, very clean
        bast could be collected, although some bark floated because it
        stuck to a piece of core, resulting in its collection with the
        core... Because the bark sinks in water and the core floats,
        flotation is an easy and effective separation method. This
        operation perfectly fits into a harvesting system with chopping
        and [wet anaerobic] ensiling..." </p>
      <p>Problems with fiber tangling can be avoided if the stems are
        cut into lengths of 5-10 mm during the harvest. A modified
        forage harvester can be used; the cut straw is fed into a hopper
        bin. A stationary 5-blade chaff cutter has been used, with a
        uniform cutting length being achieved by feeding the stems
        end-on into the cutter and minimizing the gap between the blade
        and cutting face. Over-long pieces can be removed by a sieving
        table,&nbsp;&nbsp; then fed back into the system. </p>
      <p>The Dutch company HempFlax Akkerbouw has developed a cutter
        mower that chops hemp plants into three half-meter pieces. The
        machine cuts about 7.5 acres/hour. The machine mows the plants
        down and picks up the stems. Metal brushes remove the leaf
        material and push the stalks lengthwise into the chopper. The
        cut stems are dropped in a row behind the machine to be picked
        up by a standard bailer. The company also has developed a
        turning machine that turns over the stalks in the field without
        causing damage to the fiber. John Deere manufactures the
        improved HempFlax Kemper cutter. </p>
      <p>Experimental plots grown by the Canadian Industrial Hemp
        Council were harvested with a sickle type of cutter, but the
        results were unsatisfactory. A disc-bine also was used and
        worked very well. Robert Guilford commented: </p>
      <p>"The added bonus of this machine was that it crimped the stem,
        allowing for faster retting. The part that I left for the
        combine ended up being a mistake. Putting all that stalk through
        to get the top foot was not one of my better ideas. It took me 6
        hours to unplug the combine... In 1996 we waited for a frost and
        then brought in a combine with a straight cut attachment. It cut
        the plant off at the 4 foot level and so it only had to deal
        with the top 3 feet or so. We then came in with the disc-bine to
        cut the remainder of the stalk off for [round] baling... If the
        hemp can find a place to wrap when it's a bit damp it will." </p>
      <p>According to the moisture chart developed in 1999 by the
        Canadian Grain Commission, hemp farmers should direct combine
        hemp when the seed moisture is between 25 and 30%. The Canadian
        farming magazine <i>Western Producer</i> (www.producer.com,
        9-9-99) offers the following tips for combining hemp safely: </p>
      <p>"Raise the cutter bar as high as possible to minimize the
        amount of material the combine has to process. Lower the
        cylinder speed to about 350 rpm and have the concave about half
        open. Use plenty of air to remove leaves, chaff and small or
        empty seeds.Remove straw chopper and blades.Cover exposed shafts
        with shields.Go slow. Expect to combine 1.5 to 5 acres per hour.
        Get off the combine and inspect for fiber wrapping every 45
        minutes." </p>
      <p><b><i>Methods --- </i></b>The process of harvesting large
        fields of hemp (over 100 acres) in Hungary includes a
        preliminary chemical defoliation to remove the unnecessary
        burden and volume of leaves (up to 20% of the plant weight).
        Foliage increases the cost of handling, transportation, and
        storage, and it reduces the capacity of retting basins and
        discolors the stalks. Manual defoliation is not feasible, and
        mechanical methods have not been successful. The defoliants
        Purivel (Metoxuron), Basta (ammonium glufosinate) and Round-up
        (20% glyposate) are applied by airplanes or orchard spray guns
        when the 10-15% of the male plants have flowered (within one
        week of technical maturation). These substances are toxic and
        pose grave environmental threats. </p>
      <p>G. Venturi reported on the use of defoliant-dessicants for hemp
        harvesting in 1970. Reglone (4 kg/ha in 15 hecaliters of
        water/ha) was the "most satisfactory" of 18 products tested; it
        was applied at the usual time of harvesting (when about 75% of
        the males are flowering) while postponing the mowing up to 7
        days. While defoliant-dessicants were useful for fiber
        production, it was not good when the hemp was to be used for
        paper production. </p>
      <p><i>The Humorous Hemp Primer</i> also advised farmers on the
        subject of harvesting: </p>
      <p>"Using a bailing mower will save much work, time and effort,
        but it can only be used with lower-grown crops. That is why
        German inventors provided us with a hemp mower-bailer which
        neatly cuts and ties and places hemp to the side. </p>
      <p>"So the crops can dry out quickly, carefully stack them in
        round manner using 16 bundles standing upright. When nicely
        placed, strong winds can blow right through them for rapid
        drying. </p>
      <p>"Fiber stalks deteriorate quickly if left out to dry too long.
        They cannot tolerate fall rains. The fibers shrink and gum up
        and the birds pick at them... Hemp in the shed or stack now
        browns in the sweating process. This stage of its life lasts
        about 6 weeks and is healthy for the plants since the seeds grow
        into full ripeness and readiness </p>
      <p>"This period of storage also allows the hemp stalks to ripen,
        mellow, and cure, to "gather nature" and "quality". This nature
        and quality is further developed by the subsequent manipulations
        to which the fiber is subjected, and eventually produces the
        desired high, silky character." </p>
      <p>S.S. Boyce offered this advice for harvesting hemp: </p>
      <p>"In whatever way the hemp is harvested, it is at once bound up
        in small sheaves when pulled, and stood up to dry, and then
        shocked. The seed is beaten out, the tops and roots cut off, to
        even it in length, by a sharp cutter. Or after the roots are cut
        off the hemp is stood up, bundle by bundle, and the taller
        stalks pulled out." </p>
      <p>John Bordley gave this warning to farmers in his pamphlet on <i>Hemp</i>
        (1799): </p>
      <p>"In America, Hemp and Flax are commonly dry before they are
        spread to be dew-rotted. If spread before the last of September,
        they become sunburnt, red, harsh, and dead." </p>
      <p>Mechanical harvesting may not be possible or practical in very
        small fields of seed hemp or in underdeveloped countries.
        Therefore, some specific techniques are to be recommended. An
        experienced worker using a hemp scythe can cut about half an
        acre in a day. </p>
      <p>In the opinion of the Anonymous Farmer, hemp should be
        harvested as follows: </p>
      <p>"This is the best and easiest done when the ground appears to
        be tolerably dry. When you begin to gather the HEMP, it will be
        expedient that each person employed clear before him as many
        feet of ground as the HEMP is high, in order that, after pulling
        it up by the roots, and beating off the earth that sticks to
        them, by striking the roots against his foot, he may
        conveniently spread it on the ground from whence he has pulled
        it, where it must lie until it is quite dry; it is then to be
        tied up in bundles, and put under some cover, or carefully
        stacked on the ground, in which case it must be well thatched
        with straw to prevent any wet from getting to it. Under this
        shelter it remains until about the middle of November, when it
        is spread out to rot; it is spread out in rows, taking care that
        it is spread so thin that it may get equally wet, and dry nearly
        alike... from this time it generally lies till towards the
        beginning of February... The proper time for taking it up may be
        easily known by cracking a few of the stalks, or breaking a
        handful in the brake, and if the bark is found to separate
        readily from the stems, the HEMP ought immediately to be taken
        up, which must however be done in clear weather, that the HEMP,
        when lifted, may be as dry as possible... When it is not
        convenient to brake it directly, it should be put under cover,
        so as to be entirely safe from the weather." </p>
      <p>Lionel Slator described this meticulous Dutch method of pulling
        hemp in his <i>Instructions...</i> (1724): </p>
      <p>"In Holland, they pull the long fimble-hemp separately and
        apart from the short; especially, such as they perceive to have
        shed its Leaves and Blossoms, because the short Fimble is longer
        Time at rating [retting] than the long Fimble is: They are so
        careful not to break or bruise the Carl-hemp, as they pull the
        other, that when they pull their Fimble, they are forced to take
        off their Coats and Shoes, and tuck the Skirts of their Vests
        within their Breeches, and also have the Sleeves of their Vests
        made so tight to their Arms, as none of their Cloaths might
        break or bruise the Carl-hemp... </p>
      <p>"The pulling of the long Fimble hemp apart from the short, is
        not only necessary with regard to the Watering [retting], but
        also of absolute Necessity in the working of them; for should
        the long Fimble-hemp be broke, and hackled promiscuously with
        the short, it would occasion vast waste; for the Artist always
        holds the Roots in his Hands, as evenly as he can. When he
        breaks or hackles, he must work the whole Hemp equally down to
        the Roots; and if they be of a very unequal Length, the Tops of
        the long Fimble will be over wrought, and rendered useless, if
        any of them should happen to remain". <b>(69)</b> </p>
      <p>If the hemp is left laying in the field after mowing, it must
        be turned over after two or three days. This is done by
        thrusting a fork under the stalks near the tops and throwing
        them over on their butts. The stalks are left to dry for another
        few days, and then the field hand ties them in bundles about 1
        foot in diameter with a length of old rope, pre-cut to the right
        length and looped at one end. One man can bundle from 1-1/2 to 2
        acres in a workday. </p>
      <p>The stalks should be shocked within a few days after harvest to
        avoid scalding. Sunburned fiber is unevenly colored and usually
        weaker. The stalks should be relatively free of leaves so the
        tops of the shocks are smaller and less rain can enter. Hemp
        stalks are bound in bundles about 10 inches in diameter, using
        small hemp stalks to tie them. The stack must be built to shed
        water, being higher in the center with sloping sides, and capped
        with an upright bundle. </p>
      <p>The stacks of sheaves must dry out for one week (until the
        moisture content is less than 16%) before they can be handled by
        a bale-press. Alternatively, if the local weather permits, the
        stalks can be left in swaths for a month or more while they are
        repeatedly wetted by dew and dry out. Such "pre-retted" stalks
        can be water-retted more quickly, or they can be mechanically
        processed immediately without retting. Baled hemp should be
        removed from the field as soon as possible. If they are wetted
        by rain, the bales must be opened and the sheaves stacked to dry
        out before pressing them again. </p>
      <p>The low-quality stalks that remain are gathered and burned
        (unless prohibited by law) in order to discourage hemp borers
        and recycle the nutrient ashes. The stubble also should be
        burned, because it does not decompose easily. Failure to do so
        will impede subsequent tillage and sowing. The only alternative
        is to chop the stems and stubble to 0.5 inch or smaller pieces
        with a chaff cutter. Plow the field and add nitrogen fertilizer
        to accelerate the process of decomposition. </p>
      <p>The complete plant has the following composition: C (38.94%), H
        (6.06%), N (1.74%), O (48.72%), ashes (4.54%). The stalks
        contain: C (56.80%), H (6.48%), N (0.43%), O (34.52%), ashes

      <p>A frost not exceeding 6<sup>o</sup> below freezing will not
        injure hemp except to stop further seed production and make the
        seeds shatter more easily. If possible, the seeds should be
        harvested on a cloudy day before noon when moisture helps
        prevent the loss of seeds by shattering. If a combine harvester
        is used, the weather should be sunny and dry. If the plants are
        manually harvested, they are cut down with corn knives, and
        shocked up around a few plants that have been left standing.
        After two weeks of drying, an entire shock is thrown onto a
        tarpaulin and thrashed with long sticks. The shock is turned
        over and beaten again. Two or three pecks of seeds can be
        collected from a shock of hemp. Because the seeds fall so easily
        from the dry plants, it is impossible to remove them without
        great loss and difficulty. The plants are so tall and branched
        that they cannot be fed easily into a thrashing machine. </p>
      <p>If the crop is cultivated for both seed and fiber, the plants
        are harvested in two stages: (1) the seed-bearing tops of the
        plants are cut off and threshed; (2) the remaining stalks are
        harvested. An axial-flow combine harvester with an elevated
        cutting table can be used, but the rollers must be modified to
        avoid damage to the machine, and it must be operated at high
        speed so that the cut pieces will fall into the chopper. </p>
      <p>Hempseed is cleaned first through a clod sieve with
        quarter-inch round slits, then through a seed sieve with 0.08
        inch elongated slots, then through a fanning mill. Properly
        cleaned hempseed weighs 44 lb/bushel. A low yield of hempseed is
        about 300 kg/acre; a high yield is about 500 kg/acre, or 0.7-1.2
        tons/ha. Some fiber yield is lost in the harvesting of seed hemp
        crops. The average yield is about 25 bu/acre, or about 700
        kg/ha. The collection and cleaning of hempseed can be done only
        in dry weather. </p>
      <p>Hempseed should be aerated within 24 hours after combining.
        Freshly threshed hempseed contains up to 20% moisture, and must
        be dried until the moisture content drops to 12%, preferably
        between 9 and 10%. Artificial drying should not exceed 40<sup>o</sup>
        C (105<sup>o</sup> F).&nbsp; One year of aging at 7-15<sup>o</sup>
        C with 65-75% humidity increases their viability about 15%.
        Hempseed should be kept cool and dry, as it spoils quickly under
        warm and damp conditions. Another method of preserving hempseed
        is to dry at 80<sup>o</sup> C for 15 minutes, or at 50<sup>o</sup>
        C for 4 hours. The temperature must be even: beginning the
        drying at a lower temperature and ending at a higher temperature
        will reduce the power of germination. The loss of germination
        potential can be prevented for about two years by cold storage
        (0-5<sup>o</sup> C/32-40<sup>o</sup> F) at low humidity. The
        germination rate can be maintained at 90% for up to five years
        by storage at -10<sup>o </sup>C (14<sup>o</sup> F). </p>
      <p>Francesco Crescini studied the environmental and genetic
        factors that cause variations in seed germination, and developed
        a simple method for increasing their viability: </p>
      <p>"Seed kept in in paper bags after harvest for 8-9 months, at
        7-15<sup>o</sup> C and 65-75% air humidity, have a 10-15%
        greater viability than those after-ripened only 2-3 months. The
        physiological final ripening of the seeds is accomplished on the
        plant by drying the female stems after harvest at a shady place
        for 7-10 days... Lines of different germinating power may
        result, even from pure lines, under conditions of
        self-fertilization. Cross-pollination eliminates lethal factors
        which are responsible for low germinating power. The percentage
        of viability and the readiness to germinate are independent
        genetical characteristics. The longevity of hemp seeds does not
        seem to be hereditary and is not correlated with either their
        viability or their readiness to germinate." <b>(70)</b> </p>
      <p><i>The Humorous Hemp Primer&nbsp;</i> has this to say about the
        storage of hempseed: </p>
      <p>"Never place the seeds in sacks, since they would get terribly
        hot and sweat themselves to death. Rather, use the proven method
        of spreading seeds gently on the floor, up to 10 inches deep.
        Use your hands and a shovel to gently turn and keep the seed
        alive. Early on it must be turned every other day. To avoid
        damage, wear felt shoes or cover your shoes with sacks. Hemp
        seed is only ready for storage when its humidity has sunk to
        8%." </p>
      <p>In fact, hempseed can be stored in sacks after it has been
        dried sufficiently, but it cannot be kept in a <u>dry</u>
        storeroom because the seed will lose its viability or become
        infested with bacteria. Hempseed should be sacked in 2-bushel
        bags; these are piled in groups of two, side by side, then two
        across. </p>
      <p>Edward Quincey warned posterity to exercise caution in handling
        hempseed: </p>
      <p>"The Farmer must be very careful in saving his seed, which by
        no means must lye too thick upon his floor, lest it heat and
        thereby be spoiled; to prevent which, let him stir and turn it
        frequently till it be dryed." </p>
      <p>Lionel Slator gave this description of the traditional Dutch
        method of handling hempseed: </p>
      <p>"When the Seed is thus thrash&#8217;d out of their Hemp, they convey
        it to a well-boarded Floor, where it is laid... about two or
        three inches thick, and they turn it once a Day regularly,
        during the first three Weeks, not suffering the Man who turns
        it, to have either Shoes or Pumps on, lest he should break or
        bruise the Seed by treading on it. About three weeks afterwards,
        they clean their Seed again, but not entirely from the Chaff or
        Dust... They leave that to remain with the Seed, until such time
        as the Seed is compleatly dry; because it is their Opinion, that
        this Dust and Chaff prevents the heating of the Seed as it lies
        drying... They continue the Seed still on the boarded Floor, and
        observe to turn it twice a Week, till the Season comes for
        sowing it." </p>
      <p>The Anonymous Farmer from Annapolis advised against the Dutch
        method of collecting seed: </p>
      <p>"Though this is the method... generally used for raising seed,
        yet it is by no means to be approved of; separating the seed
        plants from what you pull up occasions a great deal of trouble,
        and takes above double the time to gather and secure the HEMP
        from off the same ground... A far better method is to raise the
        seed apart by itselfe... An acre of ground, managed in this
        manner, will produce from 20 to 25 or 30 bushels of seed." </p>
      <p>Edward Antil recommended this method of harvesting seed hemp: </p>
      <p>"As the first seeds are the fullest and best, they are worthy
        of some pains to save them: and the best way to do that is, to
        bend down the plants all along... and shake them over a cloth
        spread on the ground to receive the seed; if one side of the
        plant be rooted out of the ground by forcing it down to shake
        out the seed, there will be no damage, for the seed that remains
        will ripen notwithstanding; and the plant must thus be shaken
        every two or three days, till all the seed be ripe and thus
        saved; and this is much better than pulling up the plants by the
        roots, and shaking them on a barn floor... for by this method,
        which is the common practice, one third of the seed at least
        never comes to maturity." </p>

      <p><b>2.13&nbsp;<a name="HH213"></a> ~ Apologia</b> </p>
      <p>The anonymous Farmer from Annapolis ended his <i>Essay on the
          Culture and Management of Hemp</i> (1776) with this apology: </p>
      <p>"Surely it is unnecessary to enlarge further on this head, and
        indeed the author fears that he may be thought too prolix,
        especially by those already acquainted with the subject, but
        when it is considered that these instructions are intended for
        the information of thousands, who have perhaps never seen the
        plant, he apprehends that the directions could not be too minute
        or particular." </p>
      <p>Lionel Slator offered the same reason in his <i>Instructions</i>
        (1725): </p>
      <p>"I shall conclude this Section with this general Apology in my
        own behalf, for being so large in my Observations and Remarks
        through this System of flaxen and hempen Agriculture, That I
        conceive it to be so much my Duty, fully to inform all Persons
        engaged or to be engaged in this important Matter, that I submit
        rather to be censured as prolix than deficient." </p>
      <p>S.S. Boyce gave a similar accounting for himself in his
        treatise on <i>Hemp</i> (1900): </p>
      <p>"There should be no necessity for an apology or an excuse for
        preparing a work upon hemp culture at this time. The hemp plant
        is the most widely diversified and, commercially and
        industrially, the most important plant in cultivation in Europe.
        It was among the first introduced into America, and one of the
        most extensive in cultivation among the colonists; and there is
        no good reason existing why it should not, but every reason why
        it should, today be among the first as a basis of another great
        and grand national industry, employing hundreds of millions of
        capital and hundreds of thousands of work-people." </p>
