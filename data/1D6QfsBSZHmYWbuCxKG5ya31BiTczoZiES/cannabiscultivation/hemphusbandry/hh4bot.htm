      <p>USDA botanist Lyster H. Dewey published this official
        "Botanical Study of Hemp" in 1913: </p>
      <p>"THE PLANT --- The hemp plant, Cannabis sativa L., is an
        annual, growing each year from the seed. It has a rigid,
        herbaceous stalk, attaining a height of 1 to 5 meters (3 to 16
        ft), obtusely 4-cornered, more or less fluted or channeled, and
        with well-marked nodes at intervals of 10 to 50 cm (4 to 20 in).
        When not crowded it has numerous spreading branches, and the
        central stalk attains a thickness of 3 to 6 cm (1 to 2 in), with
        a rough bark near the base. If crowded, as when sown broadcast
        for fiber, the fluted stems are without branches or foliage
        except at the top or on the shortened branches, appearing
        fascicled, are palmately compound and composed of 5 to 11 ---
        usually 7 --- leaflets. The leaflets are dark green, lighter
        below, lanceolate, pointed at both ends, serrate, 5 to 15 cm (2
        to 6 in) long, and 1 to 2 cm (3/8 to 3/4 in) wide. Hemp is
        dioecious, the staminate or pollen-bearing flowers and the
        pistillate or seed-producing flowers being borne on separate
        plants. The staminate plants are borne in small axillary
        panicles, and consists of five greenish yellow or purplish
        sepals opening wide at maturity and disclosing five stamens
        which discharge abundant yellow pollen. The pistillate flowers
        are stemless and solitary in the axils of the small leaves near
        the ends of the branches, often crowded so as to appear like a
        thin spike. The pistillate flower is inconspicuous, consisting
        of a thin, entire, green calyx, pointed, with a slit at one
        side, but remaining nearly closed over the ovary and merely
        permitting the two small stigmas to protrude at the apex. The
        ovary is one seeded, developing into a smooth, compressed or
        nearly spherical achene (the "seed"), 2.5 to 4 mm (1/10 to 3/16
        in) thick and 3 to 6 mm (1/8 to 1/4 in) long, from dark gray to
        light brown in color and mottled, The seeds cleaned for market
        nearly always include some still covered with green, gummy
        calyx. The seeds vary in weight from 0.008 to 0.027 gram, the
        dark-colored seeds being generally much heavier than the
        light-colored seeds of the same sample. The light-colored seeds
        are often imperfectly developed. Dark-colored and distinctly
        mottled seeds are generally preferred. </p>
      <p>"The staminate plants are often called the flowering hemp,
        since the pistillate flowers are rarely observed. The staminate
        plants die after the pollen is shed, but the pistillate plants
        remain alive and green two months later, or until the seeds
        fully developed. </p>
      <p>"THE STALK --- The hemp stalk is hollow, and in the best
        fiber-producing types the hollow space occupies at least
        one-half the diameter. The hollow space is widest, or the
        surrounding shell thinnest, about midway between the base and
        the top of the plant. The woody shell is thickened at each node,
        dividing the hollow space into a series of partly separated
        compartments. If the stalk is cut crosswise a layer of pith, or
        thin-walled tissue, is found next to the hollow center, and
        outside of this a layer of wood composed of hard, thick-walled
        cells. This layer, which forms the "hurds", is a very thin shell
        in the best fiber-producing varieties. It extends clear across
        the stem below the lowest node, and in large, coarse stalks
        grown in the open it is much thicker and the central hollow
        relatively smaller. Outside of the hard woody portion is the
        soft cambium, or growing tissue, the cells of which develop into
        the wood on the inside, or into the bast and the bark on the
        outside. It is chiefly through this cambium layer that the
        fiber-bearing bast splits away from the wood in the processes of
        retting and breaking. Outside of this cambium is the inner bark,
        or bast, comprising short, thin-walled cells filled with
        chlorophyll, giving it a green color, and long thick-walled
        cells, making the bast fibers. These bast fibers are of two
        kinds, the smaller ones (secondary bast fibers) toward the inner
        portion making up rather short, fine fibers, many of which
        adhere to the wood or hurds when the hemp is broken, and the
        coarser ones (primary bast fibers) toward the outer part,
        extending nearly throughout the length of the stalk. Outside of
        the primary bast fiber is a continuation of the thin-walled
        stalk, chlorophyll-bearing cells free from fiber, and
        surrounding all is the thin bark. </p>
      <p>"THE FIBER --- The hemp fiber of commerce is composed of the
        primary bast fibers, with some adherent bark and also some
        secondary bast fiber. The bast fibers consist of numerous long,
        overlapping, thick-walled cells with long, tapering ends. The
        individual cells, almost too small to be seen by the unaided
        eye, are 0.015 to 0.05 mm (3/1000 to 12/1000 in) in diameter,
        and 5 to 55 mm (3/6 to 2-1/8 in) long. Some of the bast fibers
        extend through the length of the stalk, but some are branched,
        and some terminate at each node. They are weakest at the nodes."

      <p><b>4.3 ~&nbsp;<a name="HH43"></a>Trichromes</b> </p>
      <p>Most of the aerial parts of cannabis, especially the female
        bracts, possess minute hairs, or trichromes, some of which
        excrete glistening drops of resin, so the flowers seem to shine
        with sticky amber dew which has a characteristic minty odor. It
        is thought that cannabis produces its resin as a protective
        measure against ultraviolet radiation, insects or water loss.
        Three types of trichromes occur on cannabis: </p>
      <p>1) Bulbous and cappitate (sessile and stalked),
        resin-producing, glandular hairs on the flowers, leaves and
        stems; </p>
      <p>2) Non-glandular hairs having no apparent function; 3)
        Crystoliths which resemble the non-glandular hairs, but are
        shorter and contain deposits of calcium carbonate. <b>(6-8)</b>

      <p><b>4.4 ~&nbsp;<a name="HH44"></a>Phenotypes</b> </p>
      <p>The expression of a trait in a plant strain is termed a
        phenotype. The interactions of genetic potential (genotypes) and
        environmental conditions (ecotypes) produce unique phenotypes.
        The phenotype system of distinguishing varieties reconciles many
        of the arguments about the species of hemp, all of which can be
        allocated to phenotypic groups. The phenotype system is based on
        the analysis of the relative amounts of cannabinoids:
        Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), Cannabinol (CBN), and Cannabidiol
        (CBD). <b>(9-13)</b> </p>
      <p>The Phenotype Ratio (PR) is calculated thus: <br>
        PR= %<u> THC &amp; CBN</u> <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
%

        CBD </p>
      <p>Phenotype I: The resin is composed primarily of THC. The fresh,
        manicured flowers contain more than 0.3% THC, and less than 0.5%
        CBD. Both the male and female plants produce large amounts of
        the resin. Phenotype-I plants usually originate from countries
        south of Latitude 30<sup>o</sup> N, where the tropical climate
        allows a long growing season. Often it is called Cannabis
        indica, the variety cultivated primarily for drug use. </p>
      <p>Phenotype II: The resin contains approximately equal amounts of
        THC and CBD. This group is not sharply distinguished from P-III,
        but P-II plants usually contain more THC than do P-IIIs, and the
        females are more potent than the males. P-II hemp usually
        originates from countries north of Lat. 30<sup>o</sup> N, and it
        flowers early in the summer since it is adapted to temperate
        climes. P-II may represent hybridization between P-I and P-III.
      </p>
      <p>Phenotype III: The resin contains primarily CBD (more than
        0.5%) and less than 0.3% THC. The female produces more
        cannabinoids than does the male plant. P-III hemp usually
        originates north of Lat. 30<sup>o</sup> N, and is known as
        Cannabis sativa, cultivated primarily for fiber and seeds. </p>
      <p>Phenotype IV: The resin may contain large amounts of THC, and
        traces of Cannabigerol Monomethyl Ether (CBGM) and Cannabiverol
        (CBV). P-IV hemp originates in northeast Asia, and usually is
        known as Cannabis ruderalis. </p>
      <p>The phenotypes rich in THC always possess Cannabichromene
        (CBC), sometimes in large amounts. Phenotypes rich in CBD also
        contain CBC. </p>

      <p><a name="HH45"></a><b>4.5 ~ Genetics</b> </p>
      <p>Cannabis has a haploid number of 1n=10; its somatic number is
        2n=20. Some researchers have counted 2n=18 + (XX) or (YY). In
        the male plants, 9 pairs of the normal genomic pairs of
        chromosomes are equal in size, and the tenth pair (XY) consists
        of one chromosome about the same size as the members of the
        other pairs, plus one much larger sex chromosome. Heteromorphic
        pairs of chromosomes have been observed in monoecious strains of
        cannabis. <b>(14, 15)</b> </p>
      <p>K. Hirata concluded that (x) has a higher male tendency than
        (X), and that (y) has a higher female tendency than (Y). The (X)
        has a net female tendency, and (Y) has a net male tendency. The
        male tendency in (Y) overbalances the female tendency in (X) so
        that a heterogeneous (XY) male is normally male, and a (XX)
        plant is normally female. Female hemp genes are (XX), (XXX), and
        (XXXX). The (XXXY) and (XXY) individuals are female or female
        intersexes. The males are (XY), (XYY), and (XXYY). </p>
      <p>S. Hennick, <i>et al</i>., and others assert that this
        classification is impractical for purposes of breeding hemp, and
        have developed a new classification based on the theories of
        Grishko, Neuer, and Migal. The sex of dioecious hemp is
        determined by two tightly linked genes, both with two alleles.
        The Y chromosome carries the male allele M and the allele <i>l</i>,
        which expresses loose inflorescence. The X chromosome carries
        the female allele F and the allele <i>i</i> (compact
        inflorescence). Alleles M and <i>l</i> dominate over F and <i>i</i>.
        A recessive third allele, with a frequency from 0.5-1%, probably
        exists for monoecious hemp. The sex type of monoecious hemp is
        determined by autosomes. The sex chromosomes of diploid cannabis
        carry the genotype <i>li</i>MF and <i>ii</i>FF. The theory,
        however, does not explain how the loose or compact types of
        inflorescence are determined in monoecious hemp.<b>(16)</b> </p>
      <p>N.D. Migal (All-Union Res. Inst. Fiber Crops, Glukhov) studied
        the genotypical determination of the sex of hemp. They
        summarized their finding as follows: </p>
      <p>"Monoecious and dioecious hemp plants differ from one another
        in many&nbsp; phenotypical characters. As a result, a great
        variety of sex types is formed, which, in some way, complicates
        their classification... </p>
      <p>&nbsp;"While studying spontaneous sexual mutations of dioecious
        and monoecious hemp, some peculiarities of interaction of
        genetic factors of sex chromosomes and autosomes were found out.
        They were used in further development of the theory of
        genotypical sex determination in this plant... The
        polyfunctional nature of sex determinations connected with
        monoecious hemp are conditioned by interactions of gene alleles
        of sexual chromosomes and genetical sexual factor in autosomes
        of different valency... </p>
      <p>"Chromosomal mechanism of sex determination in dioecious hemp
        plants does not often correspond to expected correlation of the
        sex types 1:1. This fact, in some way, connected with sex gene
        mutation in sexual chromosomes and their interaction with
        autosomal factors." <b>(17, 18)</b> </p>

      <p>The Sengbusch Classification system defines five degrees of
        monoecious forms: (1) 80-90% male flowers; (2) 60-70% male
        flowers; (3) 40-50% male flowers; (4) 10-30% male flowers; (5)
        less than 10% male flowers. The second and third degrees types
        are considered ideal for monoecious cultivation. </p>
      <p>The methods developed by R. von Sengbusch and H. Neuer (1943)
        are the foundation of the breeding technology for monoecious
        hemp: </p>
      <p>"Several trial fields were established in an effort to breed
        monoecious hemp in a region where no hemp is cultivated. In
        these fields the progeny of four strains which contain a great
        number of monoecious plants are cultivated. One field was
        devoted to plants with many male flowers and only a few female
        flowers; the second field, to plants with an equal number of
        male and female flowers. </p>
      <p>"Investigation of the distribution of the different types of
        intersexuality among the progeny of these plants showed that
        among the progeny of the plants from the first trial field there
        was an increased number of plants with few female and many male
        flowers, while in the second field the number of plants with
        equal number of male and female flowers was increased. This
        would seem to indicate that selection for different types of
        intersexuality is possible. While the number of pure male plants
        in the first year was 10-20%, after repetition of this
        selection, the number of males decreased to 0.8%, indicating
        that the male plants have arisen by pollination with pollen of a
        normal dioecious plant. This result shows that it is necessary
        to breed and to augment the monoecious hemp in a region where no
        dioecious hemp varieties are cultivated. </p>
      <p>"In the trial field II the number of normal female plants was
        somewhat increased (11.9%), while in the trial plot I a large
        number of pure male flowering plants with a female habit (25.5%)
        appeared, demonstrating that it is impossible to breed from
        plants with few female and many male flowers a non-segregating
        variety, and that therefore it is necessary to eliminate these
        plants in the breeding field before blossoming. </p>
      <p>"Trial plot I included, besides the monoecious plants, female
        plants of a dioecious variety. In the trial plot II there
        appeared, besides the monoecious plants with the same number of
        male and female flowers, dioecious plants which practically were
        females and had only a few male flowers; female plants which
        arose from monoecious plants, and normal females from a
        dioecious variety. The progeny from the crosses between these
        different types were analyzed. The cross of normal females with
        dioecious plants yielded female plants almost exclusively. This
        shows that the monoecious plants have the genetic constitution <u>xx</u>,
        and that dioeciousness is dominant over monoeciousness. This
        dominance, however, is incomplete; in crosses between pure
        monoecious plants a small number of female plants arose. The
        monoecious plants with a very small number of male flowers in
        crosses with monoecious plants with an equal number of male and
        female flowers gave about 80% monoecious plants and only 17%
        female plants. The plants with the same number of female and of
        male flowers gave, in crosses with the same type of dioecious
        plants, a small percentage of females, a large percentage of
        monoecious plants, and a very few male flowering plants. The
        monoecious plants with a great number of male and a small number
        of female plants, crossed with the same type of monoecious
        plants, gave practically no female plants in their progeny, but
        the greatest number of male flowering plants with female habit.
        Because these male flowering plants with a female habit have
        arisen from crosses between two monoecious plants, they must
        also be <u>xx</u> plants. </p>
      <p>"The investigation of descendants of single plants shows great
        variability in their composition as to sexual types; similar
        differences could be found between the different strains. The
        authors explain these observations by the hypothesis that the
        series of monoecious plants, beginning with the pure female and
        finishing with male flowering plants with female habit, involve
        a series of alleles of sex-realisators. The pure female plant <u>xx</u>
        has the sex-realizator F<sub>50</sub> (XX F<sub>50</sub>F<sub>50</sub>).
The

        sum is 100 and effects a complete suppression of male flowers.
        With decrease of the realisator sum the male character of the
        infloresence increases. </p>
      <p>"The male flowering plants with female habit (<u>XX</u> F<sub>25</sub>
        F<sub>25</sub> ) have the same sum as the normal male plants (<u>XY</u>
        F<sub>50</sub>f)=50. The greater realisator value is almost
        wholly dominant over the smaller. This explains why in crosses
        between female and monoecious plants only female plants arise in
        the F<sub>1</sub>. The incomplete dominance of the greater
        realisator value also explains why in crosses between monoecious
        plants 5-15% female plants always arise. The number of
        monoecious plants with equal number of male and female flowers
        which produce monoecious plants is very different among single
        strains. For breeding therefore it is necesssary to select
        strains which produce a great number of 'ideal' monoecious
        plants. </p>
      <p>"Two methods for this selection are described. In one the seeds
        are ascertained in the trial field and in the next year only
        these strains are cultivated together, and only the seeds from
        these plants are used. The other method produces results more
        rapidly. From all strains, those with the greatest number of
        'ideal' monoecious plants are established and from these strains
        the ten best monoecious plants are selected. All other plants
        are eliminated and the selected plants are cut back. After this
        treatment the plants begin to sprout and flower again and
        produce seeds, all of which are derived from selected plants." <b>(35,
          36)</b> </p>
      <p>The research of W. Hoffmann cast doubt on the theory of
        realisator-genes: </p>
      <p>"Several complimentary genes in the autosome influence the
        sexual habit of the plant. In the normal dioecious hemp the
        polymeric habit factors are also influenced by the XY mechanism,
        so that the male flowers are always combined with the male
        growth habit, and female flowers with the female growth habit.
        In the feminized and masculinized types this balance is
        disturbed and XY types with female growth habit and XX types
        with male growth habit arise. Because a continuous series exists
        of feminized forms with many to few male and female flowers and
        of masculinized forms with many to few female and and male
        flowers, it would seem that the genes for growth habit can also
        influence flower formation. The existence of different sex types
        in segregation proves that the genes for growth habit can also
        influence flower formation. The existence of different sex types
        in in segregation proves that the masculinization and the
        feminization genes are not alleles but independent genes. In the
        normal dioecious hemp plant, the XY mechanism assures the
        predominance of one factor over the others. In the intermediate
        forms of hemp the sum of the efficiency of the genes of the
        autosomes predominates so greatly that the XY mechanism is not
        decisive and on the lowest grade the growth habit, on further
        increase of the efficiency of these genes, also affects flower
        formation. On the assumption that both dominant and recessive
        genes are effective as masculinizing and feminizing genes, the
        large number of sexual and morphological segregates is readily
        explained." </p>

      <p><b>4.6 ~&nbsp;<a name="HH46"></a>Polyploidy</b> </p>
      <p>Cannabis usually is a simple diploid plant, but polyploids
        having several sets of chromosomes can be produced by mutation.
        Polyploid cannabis usually is larger, produces more resin, and
        reproduces better than diploids. It is distinguishable by its
        darker, thicker foliage, and by microscopic analysis. Tetraploid
        monoecious hemp plants are selected by examination of the number
        and size of stomata, the number of epidermis and stoma cells,
        the size of pollen grains, and their number of pores. <b>(19)</b>
      </p>
      <p>Polyploids are valuable for their genetic diversity, but they
        are unpredictable and usually are unstable in the first
        generation. They also tend to be sterile and must be propagated
        by clonal cuttings to be useful for subsequent breeding. </p>
      <p>Studies by Warmke and Zhatov revealed that the normal sex ratio
        for diploids (2n) is nearly 1:1, but tetraploids (4n) form a new
        class (XXXY) and develop about 7.5 females:1 male, plus
        female-hermaphrodites. The XXXX is female; XXXY is
        female-hermaphroditic; XYYY is male-hermaphroditic, and YYYY is
        male. The XY determination of sex does not account, however, for
        the development of some monoecious strains. Seemingly, the
        sexual expression of hemp can be controlled by some other gene
        set(s) influencing different aspects of flowering. Environmental
        conditions also can overpower the genetic expression of
        Cannabis' gender, especially in the final stages of flower
        production. <b>(20-23)</b> </p>
      <p>A. Zhatov (1979) reported these results of his research into
        hemp genetics: </p>
      <p>"Change of ploidy... induced changes on some economically
        valuable characteristics and biological features. Tetraploid
        plants of dioecious hemp are characterized with sharply
        pronounced dioecism: plants with sexual deviations appear in the
        population of tetraploid hemp. Sex chromosomes of hemp on the
        tetraploid level play a paramount part in sex determination, but
        the process of determination is affected by autosomic genes... </p>
      <p>"The viability of microspores of polyploid hemp is lower as
        compared with microspores of diploid hemp. During the storage,
        polyploid pollen loses the ability to produce pollen tubes of
        normal length. Selection of plants with the best regulated
        meiosis may raise the viability of polyploid microspores." <b>(24,
          25)</b> </p>
      <p>A. Zhatov, N. Migal, and other researchers have used
        gamma-irradiation of hempseed to mutate the subsequent plant.
        Presowing irradiation causes a drastic decrease in the survival
        rate of dioecious male plants and monoecious heterozygotic
        plants. Male sterility is manifested by empty pollen grains. The
        proportion of male plants in M<sub>1</sub> is reduced to about
        14%, and the height of plants is reduced by almost 75%. The
        number of branches and seed yields are increased, and the fiber
        content is increased by 30%. <b>(26)</b> </p>
      <p>W. Hoffman and E. Knapp treated hemp seeds with x-rays, with
        these results: </p>
      <p>"With increased dosage, the damage to the plants increased, the
        number of survivors decreased, and the sex ratio changed in
        favor of the females... With increased dosage, an increasing
        number of divergent types arose, especially of monoecious
        plants, and of male-like females. With increased dosage of
        x-rays, an increased percentage of tendrilled plants was also
        found... It is possible by means of x-ray treatment to change
        the sexuality of hemp and to get the normal dioecious hemp to a
        constant monoecious strain." </p>
      <p>When hemp pollen is treated with ultraviolet light for one
        hour, the seed obtained from the resulting plants produces twice
        as many females as males. </p>
      <p><b><i>Colchicine</i></b>--- Tetraploidy can be induced by the
        mutagenic alkaloid colchicine, which is found in the autumn
        crocus, (<i>colchicum autumnale</i>). Colchicine allows a cell
        to double its chromosomes, but prevents meiosis (the splitting
        of cells), thus forcing the cells to become polyploid. When
        applied to cannabis, colchicine produces tetraploid plants which
        tend to be taller, with greater stem diameter, seed and pollen
        size. The THC content can increase up to 250%.<b>(27)</b> </p>
      <p>A. Zhatov, <i>et al</i>., reported these findings from their
        research: </p>
      <p>"The greatest % of polyploid plants is obtained when hemp
        plants are treated with 0.5% colchicine solution for 2 hours in
        the phase of cotyledon leaves. The treatment with colchicine
        solution inhibits growth. This inhibition continues for 2.5-3
        weeks, after which the surviving plants resume normal growth and
        development. The guard cells in the leaves and the pollen grains
        of tetraploid plants are larger and the number of pores on the
        pollen grains are greater. Tetraploid plants are taller and the
        diameter of their stems, seed size and weight of 1000 seeds are
        greater. The anatomical structure of the stems differs from the
        diploid plants in a greater amount of primary and secondary
        fiber. The pollen viability of the tetraploid plants is lower
        than that of diploid plants. Vegetation period in tetraploids
        continues 8-15 days longer than in control plants." <b>(28)</b>
      </p>
      <p>Colchicine also can sprayed on the seeds while they are
        developing on the mother plant. The flowers of plants treated in
        this manner should not be smoked because the concentration of
        colchicine may be dangerously high. A third method is to soak
        seeds in the solution for 2 to 4 hours. Colchicine stimulates
        the development of the taproot at first, but this effect ceases
        within a week; then the seedlings go into shock. About 30% of
        the survivors will be polyploid. </p>
      <p>Colchicine can be bought, or prepared by grinding 100 grams of
        colchicum seeds to powder and percolating with 2 volumes of
        ethanol and 1 volume of water. The solution contains
        approximately 4 milligrams of colchicine. Label the bottle and
        store it safely: colchicine is toxic. Always wear rubber gloves
        when handling colchicine. </p>

      <p><b>4.7 ~&nbsp;<a name="HH47"></a>Breeding</b> </p>
      <p>The great American horticulturist Luther Burbank (1849-1926)
        bred cannabis and suggested that other plant developers make
        further explorations of its possibilities. He also described his
        technique for breeding giant hemp: </p>
      <p>"The hemp plant... is cultivated in this country exclusively
        for the fiber, its seed being almost altogether neglected. Yet
        the seed of this plant is prized in other countries for its oil,
        and its neglect here illustrates the same principle of wasteful
        use of our agricultural resources... </p>
      <p>"My experiments with the hemp... have grown out of a suggestion
        that I made a number of years ago to a large Boston paper
        manufacturer, to the effect that... hemp might be used as a
        substitute for wood pulp in the manufacture of paper. </p>
      <p>"The experimental work is only at its beginnings, but it seems
        to be of considerable promise... The hemp, as is well known, is
        a dioecious plant, and it may be well to mention the simple but
        uncommon method of making crosses. All the varieties are first
        planted separately; and only a few of the largest and tallest
        male and female plants of each variety are left to bloom. When
        the heads blossom, the tallest of each variety obtained from
        different sources are crossed with pollen of the tallest male
        plants. </p>
      <p>"After two seasons of this selection and crossing of different
        strains from different countries, the varieties were combined by
        crossing, as before, by selecting the largest and tallest
        plants, out of which a new race was produced of giant hemp... </p>
      <p>"Paper made from the fiber of the hemp is found not generally
        used heretofore, and must certainly be more prized as other
        pulps become scarce. </p>
      <p>"I mention this line of investigation here merely to suggest
        the wide range of opportunities what will open up for the plant
        developer when he has learned to cooperate with workers in other
        industries. </p>
      <p>"Hitherto we have been prone to take it for granted that all
        the valuable textile plants have been investigated and
        perfected. The newer studies suggest that there is still almost
        boundless opportunity for progress, not only through the
        improvement of the plants that have been utilized, but also
        through the introduction of species that have been ignored or
        neglected."<b> (29)</b> </p>
      <p>In an interview with the <i>Journal of the International Hemp
          Association</i> (October 1994), the eminent Prof. Dr. Ivan
        Bocsa (breeder of Kompolti hemp, which gives the highest yield
        of fiber in the world) explained that he has bred only dioecious
        and unisex hybrids because self-pollinated inbreeding of
        monoecious hemp produces about 20% lower stem yield than
        dioecious varieties: </p>
      <p>"The natural state in which hemp appears was and is dioecious.
        Monoeciousness is artificial in hemp, and it can only exist with
        the help of man, and without selection, the dioecious state will
        return in two or three generations. It is therefore very hard
        and demanding to keep 90 to 95% monoeciousness during seed
        multiplications. Apart from that, however, monoecious hemp is
        appropriate only when the crop is grown for so-called double
        use, i.e., when both stem and seed are harvested... In a
        dioecious crop, the male plants will be strongly deteriorated
        when the crop is harvested at seed ripeness, so in this case one
        needs monoecious cultivars. In Hungary... this double use is
        unknown. Here fibre hemp is grown as a dense crop which is
        harvested at the time of male flowering (&#8216;green hemp&#8217;), while
        the seed production takes place in crops grown at a low plant
        density and with completely different growing techniques... </p>
      <p>"Furthermore, monoeciousness has two large disadvantages. In
        the first place... we have established that 20-25% of
        self-pollination takes place in monoecious hemp, and this is the
        cause of... [10-20%] lower stem yield. In the second place, in
        monoecious hemp, the genetic progress for fibre content is slow,
        because the so-called Bredemann principle cannot be used. The
        Bredemann principle consists of the rapid determination of fibre
        content in male plants before they flower, so that only the
        males with the highest fibre content are allowed to pollinate
        the female plants... In monoecious hemp this approach cannot be
        used, so the rate of genetic progress is only 50% or less of
        that in dioecious hemp. In spite of these disadvantages, we use
        a monoecious hemp cultivar in breeding, but only as a parent for
        unisexual hemp.<b>" (30)</b> </p>
      <p>The Bredemann Principle for the estimation of fiber content is
        practiced as follows: </p>
      <p>"According to the recommended method, just before budding
        commences, the stalks of hundreds of male plants are vertically
        cut in half and the bark is stripped off. The stems are boiled
        for 3/4 hour in 1.5% NaOH solution, to soften the woody matter.
        The latter is removed mechanically, care being exercised to
        avoid loss of fiber. The fibrous mass is then boiled again with
        dilute NaOH solution, washed, dried and weighed. The woody
        matter may be weighed or detected by difference. As the
        resulting fibers are purified more than those of commerce, the
        weight of hemp so found should be multiplied by 1.25 before
        computing percentages." <b>(31)</b> </p>
      <p>The testing must be performed within a narrow window of only a
        few days, because the plants will quickly proceed to the
        flowering stage. Only those males with a high fiber content are
        allowed to flower; the others are culled. The Bredemann method
        thus enables breeders to increase the fiber yield of dioecious
        hemp to 35% within a few generations. </p>
      <p>The fiber content of stems is determined by sampling numerous
        plants from a zone situated between points 30-40% up the stem.
        In practice, find the middle of the stem and cut from that point
        downward 15%. After retting or mechanical decortication, the
        correlative standard of the fiber content is calculated from two
        weighings of the dry weight of the bark divided by the dry
        weight of the stem. <b>(32)</b> </p>
      <p>The production index of bark fiber content makes it possible to
        calculate the amount of bark per unit of stem surface, and to
        discover which parents are productive of dry matter and rich in
        fiber. The index is derived from the ratio of dry weight of bark
        to the surface of stem (obtained from the product of height
        times the median diameter). </p>
      <p>H. Neuer, R. von Sengbusch, and H. Prieger developed a rapid
        method of analysis to select plants for high yield of long
        fibers and seed: </p>
      <p>"The stems are cut into 2 or 3 pieces, and 100 such pieces are
        put in special frames in which the stems of each individual
        plant are isolated. In these frames the stems are boiled in
        0.25% NaOH for 30 minutes. The bast is removed and put in
        sieve-boxes which are shaken by machine for 1 hour in 2% NaOH
        with an addition of Persil. The individual fibers are isolated
        by the shaking and the perenchymous tissue is pulverized. After
        shaking, the fibers are washed, dried and weighed. The values so
        obtained are somewhat too high. For the selection of the
        different stem weights the fiber content classes are detected by
        investigating 10 plants. For each weight class the mean fiber
        content is ascertained and only those plants selected whose
        fiber content is above the mean of the corresponding weight
        class. Furthermore, the quantity of fibers is recorded in
        relation to the surface of the stem. A correlation table for
        fiber weight to surface of stem is made and all plants with high
        fiber content are examined with the aid of this second table to
        eliminate plants with low percentage of wood. </p>
      <p>"In the course of the investigation this method was further
        developed. In order to find plants with many fibers, plants with
        high bast content must be selected: the stems are cooked for 30
        minutes in 0.25% NaOH, and the bast is removed, washed, dried
        and weighed. The plants with high bast content are investigated
        as to fiber content to eliminate plants with high bast but low
        fiber content. The bast is cooked in 2% NaOH for 3 hours,
        washed, dried and weighed. By this method it is possible to
        investigate in the same time twice as many plants as by the
        first method. </p>
      <p>"Comparative investigations with the different methods proved
        that generally high bast content corresponds to high fiber
        content, but that individual plants with high bast content may
        have few fibers. These two methods do not make it possible to
        investigate a very great number of plants; von Sengbusch
        therefore developed a microscopic method for the examination of
        the bast- and fiber-structure; stem cutting 3-4 cm long are put
        in water for 5 minutes until the bast is thoroughly soaked. The
        cutting then is intensively lighted, but the upper part is
        darkened. By this manner of illumination the parenchymous tissue
        remains dark, while the fiber cells show clearly. The stems are
        investigated by binocular microscope (50x). Plants with a thick
        bast layer containing many fibers are selected and investigated,
        by the previously described methods, as to bast- and
        fiber-content. Only the plants with the highest fiber content
        are propagated. </p>
      <p>"For cross-pollinating hemp the breeding system is the same as
        that devised by Laube for rye: the seed of each selected plant
        is divided. In the first year, one half is sown as A-strains and
        tested as to quality. From the best A-strains, the remainder of
        the seed is sown the following years as A-strains. In the same
        way the B-strains are obtained and the strains with lower fiber
        content are eliminated. The B-strains are used for the
        production of material for new selection and for the production
        of super-elite, and elite plants and improved seed." <b>(33)</b>
      </p>
      <p>Prof. Dr. Bocsa developed a unisex cultivar in the 1960s after
        hempseed for sowing became scarce: </p>
      <p>"From the research conducted by McPhee, von Sengbusch and
        Hoffman we know that when a monoecious hemp plant pollinates a
        dioecious female the offspring (F1) consists of over 90% of
        females, or 3-5% of monoecious plants bearing mainly female
        flowers and only 3-4% of true males. This small number of males
        however is sufficient to ensure adequate pollination of the
        crop. As the stand consists mainly of seed-bearing (female and
        dioecious) plants, with the same habit, we called it unisexual
        hemp. Such a stand yields 60-80% more seeds than a dioecious
        cultivar. The seed produced on this stand (F2) is used as sowing
        seed for fibre production. We called this cultivar Uniko-B. It
        is, in fact, a 'single cross' between Kompolti and Fibromon, but
        it is the F2 generation which is commercialized. Von Sengbusch
        and Hoffman described the phenomenon, but they did not think of
        its practical use... we make the cross between Kompolti and
        Fibromon on a surface of 5 hectares; this yields 2500 kg of F1
        seed. The F1 seed is sown on a surface of 500 hectares, yielding
        400,000 kg of F2 seed, which is used to sow 3,000-3,500 hectares
        of fibre hemp. </p>
      <p>"Unisexuality also can be used to exploit the effect of
        heterosis [hybrid vigor] which occurs when Chinese and European
        (Kompolti) cultivars are crossed. This heterosis can increase
        stem yield by 8-15%. to be able to cross two cultivars we have
        to construct a female parent which is 'male sterile'. A
        unisexual F1 can be used as such. In order to obtain a unisexual
        Chinese line we used Fibrimon as the donor, which was
        backcrossed many times until we obtained a monoecious line with
        a Chinese habit. We crossed this line with the original
        dioecious Chinese cultivar to obtain a unisexual Chinese F1...
        [with] an unsurpassed seed yield potential of up to 1,500-1,600
        kg per hectare... </p>
      <p>"In some of my cultivars, bark content is 38-40%; this
        corresponds to a bast fibre content of 32-34%. If the bark
        content is higher than 40% the crop may lodge... </p>
      <p>"Fibre quality is negatively related to fibre content. As we
        continue to select for fibre content, we unwillingly increase
        the proportion of secondary fibre, which has a negative effect
        on fibre quality." </p>
      <p>The fiber content of monoecious cultivars can be increased by
        60-100%, up to triple the content of the parent stock, with a
        content of 30% or more of cleaned fibers. </p>
      <p>Monoecious (intersex) varieties of hemp are capable of
        self-pollinating, which soon leads to inbreeding and depression
        of desired traits. The cultivation of monoecious hemp is
        feasible only where hemp is cultivated for both fiber and seeds,
        to be harvested simultaneously. The strains are not stable and
        so must be maintained by human intervention. </p>
      <p>V.P. Soroka studied the formation of male reproductive system
        in monoecious and dioecious hemp, and reported that the
        differences between them at very stage of growth prove that
        dioecious hemp is biologically superior. <b>(34)</b> </p>
      <p>Z. Loseva reported these findings: </p>
      <p>"The degree of the manifestation and change in monoecism
        depends on the growing conditions. When hemp is isolated from
        other varieties (1.5-2 km) and when the strains are carefully
        separated at the right times, monoecious hemp preserves 80-90%
        of the monoecious plants and 0.5-1.5% of the common staminate
        hemp for many years. If monoecious hemp is grown along with
        dioecious varieties, monoecism disappears. After two years of
        growing under such conditions, the monoecious hemp actually
        becomes converted into dioecious hemp." <b>(37)</b> </p>
      <p>The French strains of industrial hemp are "pseudohybrid
        unisexual" cultivars which are more easily produced and reliably
        maintained than monoecious varieties: </p>
      <p>Parent Stock:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Dioecious) x (Monoecious) = F1
        Generation: (Unisexual) x (Monoecious) = F2 Generation:
        Marketable Seeds. Dioecious cultivars are bred as follows:
        Parent Stock: (Dioecious Female) x (Monoecious Male) = F1
        Generation: (Female 1) x (Monoecious male) = F2 Generation:
        (Female 2) x (Monoecious Male) = F3 Generation: (Stable
        Dioecious Cultivar). </p>
      <p>Male plants with insufficient fiber content are removed from
        the crop before they pollinate; thus, the females are fertilized
        by the best males only. The seeds of females with the best fiber
        content are sown the next spring. The selection process is
        repeated annually. </p>
      <p>G.S. Stepanov reported on characteristics of heterosis in
        unisexual hemp hybrids&nbsp; which he obtained by crossing
        maternal dioecious hemp with the paternal monoecious form: </p>
      <p>"The F<sub>1</sub> generation consisted almost completely of
        female plants (88.3-98%). Heterosis was established for seed
        yield, which represents a complex expression of many
        interrelated reproductive qualities. A discrete character of
        heterosis for elements of productivity is suggested, based on
        the height and weight of stem, weight of seeds and weight of
        fiber." <b>(38, 39)</b> </p>
      <p>In a report on the "Phenonemon of unisexuality and heterosis in
        first generation hemp hybrids", Stepanov declared: </p>
      <p>"Intervarietal hybridization of dioecious forms with monoecious
        forms is a highly effective means for increasing the yield of
        hemp. The unisexual hybrids are promising for use under
        commercial conditions, since they can be harvested without
        hand-picking of staminate hemp, and they have a high yield of
        stems, seeds and&nbsp; fiber. Depending on the combination,
        heterosis can be noted either only for individual elements of
        the structure or for an entire complex of characters... </p>
      <p>"The F1 unisexual hybrids of hemp obtained from crossing
        dioecious and monoecious varieties most often manifest heterosis
        in seed yield. The hybrid plants (as compared to the parental
        forms) are characterized by a higher homeostasis of
        development... Heterosis has a discrete nature in relation to
        elements of productivity." </p>
      <p>In his "Evaluation of hybridization capacity of hemp cultivars
        in breeding for heterosis", Stepanov reported: </p>
      <p>"Common and specific capacities for hybridization in hemp
        cultivars are slightly different genetically. Specific capacity
        for hybridization of the crossing components is of the greatest
        significance for heterosis manifestation in the first generation
        hybrids. To obtain a high heterosis effect it is necessary to
        choose for breeding in the first turn the cultivars with high
        specific capacity for hybridization... </p>
      <p>"When crossing varieties that are equal in height, the
        variation scope in hemp varietal hybrids exceeds the limits of
        the ranged series of the parental forms. The highest
        heritability index (0.79-0.87) is obtained in simple and complex
        hybrids. To create heterosis hybrids both parents should be
        selected out of the tall-stalked varieties." <b>(40, 41)</b> </p>
      <p>Breeding techniques can be used to stabilize a seed line, to
        incorporate a desirable trait, or to remove an undesirable
        charcteristic. The simple process of "line breeding" serves well
        to maintain the stability of a seed line. Select at least
        several female plants for seed production, and pollinate only a
        few of their flowers. If the variety is very inbred, it is
        advisable to collect pollen from several male plants in order to
        preserve any diversity in the seedline. Thus, the line can be
        stabilized for several more generations. </p>
      <p>The method of "back-crossing" can be used to stabilize new
        hybrid seedlines, but it takes several generations to do so. As
        the name implies, seeds from an earlier generation are crossed
        with those of later crosses. A second generation (F2) hybrid
        female is crossed with an F2 male to produce the F3 seed. The F2
        and F3 seeds are planted and a worthy F2 female is crossed with
        a choice F3 male. A male is selected from each subsequent
        generation (F4, F5, etc.) to be backcrossed with a female grown
        from F2 seed. </p>
      <p>Stepanov reported on the "Variability and heritability of
        principal elements of productivity in intercultivar hemp
        hybrids" in 1977: </p>
      <p>"The significant effect of backcrosses of paternal forms on the
        degree of the determination of characters in hemp hybrids was
        studied. Maternal forms have such an effect for simple and
        complex intervarietal hybrids. The highest phenotypical
        variability obtained was connected with the number and weight of
        seeds per plant. The effect of genotype on the phenotypical
        manifestation of symptoms is evidently a result of simple and
        complex intervarietal crosses, so it is easier to make the
        selection of populations of such hybrids than in back population
        because environmental conditions insignificantly hide hereditary
        differences among plants." <b>(42)</b> </p>
      <p>In 1978, however, Stepanov reported on "The <u>ineffectiveness</u>
        of the back-crossing method selection of hemp for heterosis": </p>
      <p>"In back crossings the additive effect of the genes
        predominates. The selection of the characters controlled by the
        additive genes leads to the homozygous increase of&nbsp; the
        population and reduced vitality of the plants. The repeated
        crossings of the heterozygous hybrid plants with the parental
        form homozygous for the recessive gene increases the quota of
        the genes of the latter. It results in the intermediate type of
        inheritance for all the elements of the backcross hybrid
        productivity... </p>
      <p>"The use of the <b>inbreeding method</b> in hemp breeding...
        as a method of differentiating a heterogenous population and
        selection of the most valuable biotypes is the first stage in
        the creation of controlled heterosis. The investigated hemp
        cultivars were heterozygotic not only for numerous characters
        but also for combining ability, which even after 5-fold
        self-pollination was manifested in different families to a
        different degree. The magnitude of combining ability of the line
        was higher, the more strongly it was differentiated
        genotypically relative to all other lines. In the first stages
        of practical breeding, the inbreeding methods can be used in
        creating heterotic variety-line hybrids. </p>
      <p>"Heritability of main productivity elements and their
        anticipated gain in populations of various types of
        intervarietal hemp hybrids...&nbsp; plant height and fiber
        content in a stem, are highly-heritable irrespective of the
        crossing types. Low heritability is typical of such integral
        characters, as the number and weight of seeds from one plant;
        they are modified depending on the growth conditions. The higher
        the heritability coefficient, the greater the genetic gain of
        characters. Other conditions being equal, selection is more
        efficient. From the theoretical view point the expected gain of
        all the productivity elements at simple and complex
        intervarietal crossing is considerably higher than at reciprocal
        ones." <b>(43-45)</b> </p>
      <p>M.A. Fedin reported concerning "The efficacy of gametocides
        inducing male sterility" in 1984: </p>
      <p>"The heterotic breeding method is more effective than the
        methods used before. The breeding process is shorter. It is
        possible to produce the necessary quantity of hybrid seeds in a
        shorter period." <b>(46)</b> </p>
      <p>K. Goncharova and N. Migal observed "Deviations in meiosis in
        four sources of hemp male sterility": </p>
      <p>"Microsporocytes dying off, migration of the chromosomes beyond
        the borders of the spindle division in the metaphase and
        anaphase, lagging chromosomes in the anaphase, formation of the
        micronuclei in the telophase, and asynchronous division of the
        microsporocytes." <b>(47)</b> </p>
      <p>N.D. Migal also studied the inheritance of the length of the
        vegetative period: </p>
      <p>"Families with different intervals between ripening of male and
        female plants were revealed in dioecious hemp. This permits
        breeding for simultaneously ripening forms by selecting families
        with a minimum interval." <b>(48)</b> </p>
      <p>Migal's research also revealed another useful finding: </p>
      <p>"The dwarfs of monoecious hemp represent a recessive mutation
        form valuable for studying peculiarities of natural mutagenesis
        and changes in the development of sex expression." <b>(49)</b>
      </p>
      <p>The intersexual form of male sterility in the plants of
        monoecious hemp is characterized by a complete lack of pollen.
        It is inherited by the next posterity through the monofactorial
        type of inheritance, which makes it possible to use it as a
        maternal form in the process of hybridization. </p>
      <p>The transition of male to female flowers can be accomplished by
        wounding the infloresences of male plants. The anther lobes will
        transform into ovules. The earlier this process begins, the more
        normal is the development of female flowers. Bisexual flowers
        also are obtained. <b>(50)</b> </p>
      <p>R. Savelli and N. Soster reported the induction of monophylly
        by wounding hemp: </p>
      <p>"[Wounds were inflicted by] extirpation of the apex of the
        principal bud, cutting of lateral branches, cutting back the
        plant at various heights, and in all cases total exfoliation...
        High mortality resulted. The best cases of monophylly occurred
        in plants cut back 20-25 cm from the ground. Lateral buds grew
        rapidly in place of the terminals removed. Monophylly is
        homologized with a juvenile form. The wounding was ineffective
        in changing the sex ratio." </p>
      <p>Monoecy of hemp also can be induced by control of soil
        moisture. Z. Loseva grew hemp in different watering regimes,
        with these results: </p>
      <p>"Soil moisture of 60-80% proved most suitable for the
        establishment of monoecy. The seed yield increased with the
        increased soil moisture. In order to obtain a more widespread
        monoecy and higher seed yields, hemp should be grown on fertile
        low-lying fields... </p>
      <p>"When the monoecious variety is grown during a shorter day, a
        smaller number of monoecious plants and lower seed yields are
        obtained. On the other hand, lengthening of the day, improvement
        of the water regime, and reasonable ratio of NKP favors a rise
        in the percentage of monoecious plants and an increase in the
        seed yields." <b>(51, 52)</b> </p>
      <p>Loseva and Arinshtein found these conditions to be optimal for
        monoecious hemp: </p>
      <p>"When grown isolated from other hemp varieties and varietal
        purity maintained, monoecious hemp consists of 98-99% of
        monoecious and simultaneously ripening plants. If pure seed is
        not used, next year the percentage of common fimble will
        increase 4-6% and a year later to 8-12%. Monoecious hemp cannot
        be grown on seed plants without isolation or alongside dioecious
        varieties. The greatest number of monoecious hemp plants was
        observed under natural day length (79-90%); the smallest, under
        a short day (32-63%). Consequently the transfer of monoecious
        hemp varieties into shorter day conditions results in a
        reduction of seed yield, owing to the decrease in monoecious
        plants. Optimal conditions for monoecy development are attained
        by complete mineral fertilizer replacement and by soil moisture
        equal to 69-80% of the total moisture capacity." <b>(53)</b> </p>

      <p><b>4.8 ~&nbsp;<a name="HH48"></a>Light</b> </p>
      <p>Cannabis' rate of growth is proportional to the intensity of
        the light it receives, and is inversely proportional to the
        length of the photoperiod. </p>
      <p>Cannabis responds to light in accordance with the intensity,
        wavelength, and photoperiod. Cannabis is a "short-day" species:
        it flowers when the photoperiod decreases to about 8 hours. The
        plant requires at least 3 hours of light daily just to survive,
        and at least 8 hours daily to thrive. While the plant is young,
        up to 3 months old, it responds vigorously to increasingly
        longer periods of light (up to 16 hours). Daily photoperiods of
        16 hours or more will cause cannabis to grow indefinitely in a
        vegetative phase. The plant will grow about 25% faster under
        24-hour lighting. Nutrient consumption increases
        proportionately. <b>(54)</b> </p>
      <p>The photoperiod must be shortened to less than 10 hours to
        induce flowering and complete the growth cycle. Cannabis flowers
        quickest with a photoperiod of 8 hours. Thus, mature plants will
        develop flowers within 2 weeks of short-day treatment. Immature
        plants require up to one month of long nights to induce
        flowering. A short light period usually will bring cannabis into
        bloom within a month after emerging from the ground, but of
        course the plants will be very small. Short photoperiods inhibit
        the growth of stems and foliage, leaves produce fewer serrations
        in the margins. Flowering is hastened. The number of serrations
        correlates well with the degree of lighttime treatment. </p>
      <p>Erratic lighting will confuse cannabis. V. Sofinskaya studied
        the conditioning of hemp with lighttime, and observed the
        following effects: </p>
      <p>"The decrease in day length favored the acceleration of light
        stage completion but was unfavorable to plant growth. A
        prolonged short-day treatment resulted in a greater growth delay
        and in stunted plants, especially when plants were grown under
        short-day conditions since their emergence. Sharp changes of
        light conditions during the light stage resulted in various
        morphological alterations and in the appearance of hemp forms
        widely differing in habitat. Changes in light conditions during
        the light stage caused transgression in the normal course of the
        stadial plant development, resulting in considerable
        morphological changes of infloresence development as well as in
        the shape and size of leaves." <b>(55)</b> </p>
      <p>Cannabis must not be disturbed during its night; unscheduled
        illumination during the dark period will inhibit flowering.
        Total darkness is required. The flowering response of hemp is
        controlled by the length of the dark night, not by the length of
        daylight. As little as 0.03 footcandles (FC) of red light
        interrupting the dark period will inhibit the anthesis of hemp.
        A long night thus becomes two short nights separated by an
        extremely short day, such as 1 minute of illumination. </p>
      <p>Very long nights cause hemp flowers to ripen more quickly. This
        technique is most effective after the 4th week of the flowering
        phase. Far red light (supplied by incandescent spotlights) can
        reduce the time required for the flowering phase by about one
        week. </p>
      <p>Cannabis will grow with as little as 800 FC of light, but the
        growth will not be vigorous. A minimum of 1500 FC is required
        for a healthy crop. When grown in a short-day regime under
        low-intensity light, cannabis becomes starved for photons. The
        hypocotl elongates excessively during the first 2 weeks after
        the plant emerges. It may reach a height of 6 inches before any
        internode leaves develop in the plumule. If the illumination is
        intensified, the plants may survive, and they will develop a
        clockwise spiral twist in the cotyledon. </p>
      <p>Low light levels also produce smaller, thinner leaves,
        elongated internodes, reduced concentrations of chlorophyll, and
        less dry weight. High levels of light shorten the growth period,
        stimulate branching and budding, and increase the production of
        red anthocyanin pigments. Excessive light causes dessication,
        bleaching due to photodestruction of chlorophyll, and then
        necrosis. </p>
      <p>Laser light has similar effects. G. Krustev, <i>et al.</i>,
        used a He-Ne laser (632.8 nm/15 &amp; 30 minutes) and a nitrogen
        laser.&nbsp; The sowing qualities of the seed are improved, the
        phases of plant development are shortened, the plants are more
        vigorous, and the yield of seeds and stems. <b>(83)</b> </p>
      <p><b><i>Rejuvenation</i></b> --- The growth cycle of cannabis
        usually lasts about 16 weeks. When cultivated indoors, however,
        cannabis can be rejuvenated after it has bloomed and begins to
        go into senile decline. Some varieties are very amenable to
        rejuvenation after their flowers have been harvested. The plants
        should be cut back to the second branching node. Let as many
        leaves as possible remain, and a few buds. Give the plants at
        least 18 hours of light daily. New meristems will develop within
        three weeks. Extra nutrients (especially N) must be supplied at
        this time, or the new flowers will be male. The process can be
        augmented with foliar sprays of Indole Acetic Acid (IAA) or
        Napthalene-AA. The soil should also be treated with the
        hormones. Hemp can be rejuvenated repeatedly with such
        treatment, thus living several times longer than usual. Even
        without continuous-light rejuvenation, female hemp may live
        several months longer after flowering if the plant remains
        unpollinated. If female plants become senile between
        rejuvenations, then sex-reversals usually occur, especially
        under the influence of short-day photoperiods after the
        continuous-light treatment. In such a case, about 90% of the
        females reverse to male or hermaphroditic intergrades. <b>(56-60)</b>
      </p>
      <p>Rejuvenated cannabis blossoms from the terminal bud or from
        lateral buds below the infloresence. Usually the first few
        leaves on rejuvenated plants are entire (smooth edged). After
        several such leaves have developed, subsequent leaves again have
        the usual serrations. When grown under continuous light, the
        phyllotaxy of the branches changes from opposite to alternate at
        some point after the seventh node. Plants grown with normal
        long-days do not change their phyllotaxy until 12 internodes
        have developed. Rejuvenated plants are very sensitive to tobacco
        smoke and can be killed by it. </p>
      <p>D. Kohler researched the effects of short and long days on hemp
        morphology, and found another way to rejuvenate cannabis, based
        on its response to light: </p>
      <p>"In short-day and long-day hemp the first leaves are simple and
        comparatively broad, the later are divided, their leaflets being
        comparatively narrow. The size of the leaves following one
        another is continuously increased. Plants begin to flower
        (qualitatively reacting short-day hemp in short-day only). The
        shape of the leaves produced in the infloresence is determined
        in the first days of flowering: they become more and more simple
        and their leaflets comparatively broader. The leaf size is
        influenced by the length of day. The leaves of plants kept in
        flower-inducing daylength grow less and less due to competition
        between reproductive and vegetative organs, whilst the leaves of
        flowering plants, which are transferred into longer day, grow
        larger and larger. In this case the latest leaves are of the
        same size and shape as the earliest one; a second life-cycle
        starts, whilst the plants in the original daylight are dying.
        Considering the photoperiodic response of hemp, leaf-size is a
        measure of the physiological age. With monoecious hemp a certain
        leaf size is necessary for the formation of male flowers. If
        female plants are put into longer day during blossom, they do
        imitate the male habit." <b>(61)</b> </p>
      <p>Ocra Wilton found a correlation of cambial activity with
        cannabis' flowering and regeneration: </p>
      <p>"A study was made of cross-sections of all the internodes from
        the tips to the bases of the stems... When Cannabis sativa has
        reached an advanced stage of reproductiveness, the meristematic
        tissue of the stem tends to become entirely differentiated into
        xylem and phloem elements. This anatomical condition is a
        possible explanation of the death of such plants at the close of
        one reproductive cycle. The cessation or decline of cambial
        activity which accompanies the production of flowers in C.
        sativa progresses from the region of the infloresence toward the
        base of the plant, which it may or may not reach depending on
        the degree of reproductiveness which the plant attains.
        Vigorously vegetative plants have an active cambium throughout
        their stems... a certain amount of at least potentially
        meristematic tissue is necessary for a renewal of vegetative
        growth in stems." </p>
      <p><b><i>Photoperiodism ---- </i></b>Photoperiodic control can be
        very useful to the cannabis breeder. If yield is not important
        (as is often the case in the early stages of a breeding
        program), the time required for the life cycle can be greatly
        reduced by using short photoperiods. Thus, several generations
        of plants can be produced each year. Under such conditions,
        cannabis will flower when it is only a few inches tall. <b>(62)</b>
      </p>
      <p>Photoperiodic control makes it possible to synchronize the
        flowering dates of male and female plants, thus making possible
        their cross-breeding. Most importantly, photoperiodic control
        enables breeders to stimulate the production of male flowers on
        female plants. Self-pollination can be accomplished only by
        means of such flowers. Male flowers on female hemp do not
        contain the Y (male) chromosome; they produce only female
        pollen. When this is used to fertilize female flowers on female
        plants, they will produce purely female seeds. The pollen from
        male flowers is of two kinds, and usually produces a ratio of
        males 1:1 females. A few viable seeds can be obtained from
        female flowers produced on male plants and self-pollinated, but
        such seeds are only weakly fertile and produce mostly female
        plants. </p>
      <p>The following procedure will produce seeds which will grow 100%
        female hemp: </p>
      <p>Cultivate two separate groups of female plants indoors. The
        plants should receive at least 50 watts of light per square foot
        of growing area. One group must not receive more than 7 hours of
        light daily. This will induce male flowers to manifest on the
        female plants. The second group of females must receive about 16
        hours of light daily to ensure that no male flowers develop on
        them. The long photoperiod also inhibits the development of
        flowers so much that the short-day plants will mature 2 or 3
        weeks before the long-day group. Therefore, begin cultivating
        the long-day females at least 2 weeks before planting the
        short-day plants. </p>
      <p>As the two groups approach maturity, remove any males which may
        appear. A few weeks before the male hemp begins to flower, the
        internodes of the stem begin to elongate very quickly. The
        dominant male enzyme andrase produces thin plants with a tuft of
        leaves at the top. The leaves are smaller than those of the
        females, and have fewer leaflets (usually 5). Tiny buds
        sometimes appear in the nodes about 2/3 up the stalk. The future
        sexual expression of hemp may be determined by examining these
        premature flowers. If the buds remain erect, the plant is
        female. If the buds droop, the plant is male. </p>
      <p>When clusters of female buds begin to appear on plants in the
        long-day group, cover each bud with a transparent plastic bag
        sealed with a rubber band around the stem below the bud cluster,
        so as to protect the flowers from accidental pollination. </p>
      <p>When male buds appear on some of the female plants in the
        short-day group, cover each bud with a transparent bag sealed
        with a rubber band around the stem below the bud cluster, so as
        to protect the female flowers from accidental pollination. </p>
      <p>When male buds appear on some of the females in the short-day
        group, carefully cut off every male bud and store them in a
        glass jar. Any new male buds which appear also must be pruned.
        Within a few days the anthers of the clipped buds will open and
        release pollen. Collect this pollen and apply it with a thin
        brush to the stigmas of the bagged flowers in the long-day
        group. Because this pollen contains only female chromosomes, the
        fertilized female flowers on the long-day female group will
        develop seeds which will produce only female plants.<b>(63-66)</b>
      </p>
      <p>Another method of manipulating the gender of cannabis involves
        treatment of the male pollen with ultra-violet light for about 1
        hour. This doubles the ratio of the females to males, perhaps by
        neutering the weaker male chromosomes. <b>(67, 68)</b> </p>
      <p>The viability of hemp pollen can be preserved by the method of
        Migal and Arinshtein: </p>
      <p>Storage of pollen in a refrigerator will protect breeding
        material for 38-45 days, which is important for crossing
        different varieties of hemp. Hemp pollen can also be stored in
        the dark placing it in a desiccator over calcium chloride or
        concentrated sulfuric acid. Here the pollen grains retain the
        viability to germinate for 12-18 days. The pollen of dioecious
        varieties of hemp retain viability longer than the pollen of
        monoecious varieties. <b>(69)</b> </p>
      <p>G. Davidyan found these effects of light on the root
        development of hemp: </p>
      <p>"The growth of the root system in hemp was found to be more
        intensive than that of the stem at the vernalizaton and light
        stages. The root system is less vigorous in short than in long
        day conditions. At the stage of rapid development --- the
        beginning of budding up to flowering --- an intensive stem and
        root system growth is observed. The root system of female hemp
        plants is superior in vigor to that of male plants." <b>(70)</b>

      <p><b>4.9 ~&nbsp;<a name="HH49"></a>Sexual Expression</b> </p>
      <p>The sexual expression of cannabis is determined by its genetic
        makeup, and by its metabolic temper, which is regulated by the
        male enzyme andrase and the female enzyme gynase. Environmental
        conditions (light, nutrients, soil and water) may suppress the
        formation of the dominant enzyme, and allow the opposite sex to
        express itself partially (hermaphroditism) or completely (sex
        reversal). <b>(71, 72)</b> </p>
      <p>E. Galoch found that cytokinin is important for the sexual
        expession of hemp: </p>
      <p>"Transition of female and male hemp plants from the vegetative
        to the generative phase is associated with a rise in cytokinin
        level while that of male inflorescences proceeds at a decreasing
        cytokinin level. The activity of cytokinins apparently is
        associated with an enhancement of the female tendency..." <b>(73)</b>
      </p>
      <p>Gibberellin will inhibit the formation of flowers on cannabis,
        but sometimes it will otherwise cause the growth of fertile
        female flowers on genetically male plants. Silver nitrate or
        cobalt chloride causes masculinization of flowers of female
        hemp, possibly due to blockage of ethylene synthesis. High
        levels of N salts --- and long photoperiods --- have a
        masculinizing effect on hemp.<b>(74-76)</b> </p>
      <p>According to K. Conrad, there are sex-linked differences of the
        auxin content in male and female hemp plants: </p>
      <p>"During blossoming the vegetative parts of the males contain
        more auxin than those of the females. In the dying leaves and
        stems a remarkable increase of auxin can be observed." <b>(77)</b>
      </p>
      <p>J. Heslop-Harrison&nbsp; studied auxin and sexuality in
        Cannabis: </p>
      <p>"Dioecious hemp plants were grown to an age of 20 days in a
        day-length of 21-22 hours, then given an inductive treatment of
        ten 8-hour days to initiate flowering. After return to long days
        and during the period of differentiation of flower buds, a total
        of 0.5 gr lanolin paste containing 0.5% NapthaleneAcetic Acid
        (NAA) was applied to leaves at the 3rd and 4th nodes. In
        genetically male plants, female plants were subsequently formed
        in sites which would normally be occupied by males, a result
        which appears to be regulated by the level of native auxin in
        the vicinity of meristems during the period of differentiation
        of flower primordia. Secondary effect of auxin treatment were
        evident in an over-all reduction in intensity of heteroblastic
        development, the trend towards a reduction of leaf lobing and
        serration which normally accompanies plants passing through a
        period of flowering than in untreated controls." <b>(78)</b> </p>
      <p>Nitrogen fertilizers masculinize the phenotype by stimulating
        the formation of male flowers. The proportion, number and degree
        of monoecious plants increases with increasing N, and the total
        N content is always higher in monoecious individuals than it is
        in females. <b>(79)</b> </p>
      <p>Treatment of hempseed with ethylene gas will increase the
        resulting number of female plants by about 50%. Ethylene is
        produced by certain plants (i.e., bananas, cucumbers and
        melons), and these can be used to treat hempseed in a simple
        manner. About two weeks before you plan to sprout the seeds,
        place them in a paper bag or envelope and put that in a plastic
        bag with the peels of a ripening banana or cucumber. Replace the
        peels after a couple of days, and change the bags to prevent
        mold. </p>
      <p>Hempseed can be feminized while they are forming on the plant.
        Fruit peels are spread around the area for two weeks before the
        plants enter the flowering phase. Remove the skins when the
        plants begin to flower. Otherwise, treatment with Etephon will
        accomplish the same effect. </p>
      <p>When hempseed is treated with the female hormone estrogen,
        percentage of females that are produced will increase by about
        10%. Dissolve a birth control pill in water and soak the seeds
        overnight in the solution. After the initial soaking, continue
        to treat the seeds by sprouting them on a paper towel soaked in
        the solution. <b>(80)</b> </p>
      <p>A.I. Zhatov tested the effects of ethrel on hemp: </p>
      <p>"Treatment of hemp plants with an aqueous solution of ethrel
        changed the ratio of male to female flowers. The greatest effect
        was observed when plants were treated during flowering of male
        flowers." <b>(81)</b> </p>
      <p>Electricity also can change the sexual expression of cannabis;
        B.R. Lazarenko and I.B. Gorbatovskaya reported: </p>
      <p><b>"Under the influence of the electrical current, the
          numerical proportions between hemp plants of different sexes
          was changed</b> by comparison with the control <b>to
          give&nbsp; an increase of female plants by 20-25%... The
          characteristics acquired by the plants in electrically treated
          soils are transmitted by inheritance to the third
          generation...</b>" [emphasis added] <b>(82)</b> </p>
      <p>Photoperiodism is a most useful tool with which to control the
        sexual expression of cannabis. For example, J. Limberk made a
        careful study of lighttime on the sexual index of hemp, and
        reported thus: </p>
      <p>"Male plants usually flowered earlier than female. Female
        plants flowered only when the period of daylight was shorter
        than 14 hours; male plants flowered even when the day was longer
        than 14 hours. Reduction of light intensity in the first stages
        of plant development lead to increases of female plants by 4.3%.
        Intersexual plants (22-30% of the total) were present in
        conditions of 11-13 hours light per day. Grafting of plants did
        not change sex." </p>
      <p>Monoeciousness effected by short days&nbsp; is not fixed in the
        descendants. <b>(84)</b> </p>
      <p>The probable future sex of a pre-floral hemp plant can be
        guessed at by calculating the Leaf-Mass Index (LMI): Count the
        points (3, 5, 7) on 3 leaves in the center of a cluster. Divide
        that number by 3 to determine the average number of points.
        Repeat the process several times, and figure that average also.
        Multiply the two averages to determine the LMI. A high LMI
        indicates that the plant will be female. </p>
      <p>The phyllotaxy changes to alternate just before the onset of
        flowering. Then the sex of the plant can be determined by making
        a close examination of the upper nodes of the main stem. The
        onset of flowering is indicated by the appearance of
        undifferentiated primordial buds behind the stipules at the
        nodes of the petioles (along the stem at the base of branches).
        Within a few days they differentiate. The male pistils are flat
        or knobby with a curved shape and 5 open petals about 5 mm.
        long; they have a single tiny stalk. Overlapping vegetation
        often disguises their appearance. </p>
      <p>The female develops pairs of flowers surrounded by pointed
        bracts of protective leaves that will enclose the seed. The
        female stigma usually appear as 2 fuzzy white hairs forming a
        "V" that protrudes from a bract. Resinous hairs (glandular
        trichromes) cover the calyx (2-6 mm long). </p>
