      Eliminating noroviruses from oyster has been an important issue in
      the oyster cultivation business. Washing oysters using ultrafine
      bubbles including ozone two days prior to shipment eliminates any
      noroviruses and results in beautiful cream-colored oysters. <br>
      <br>
      Ultrafine bubbles are present in every hole and corner of the
      cells of organisms, activate them, and at the same time prevent
      the structure of cells from breaking down when frozen. <br>

      Living oysters frozen at minus 20 degrees Celsius the previous day
      come alive again after being thawed in seawater at room
      temperature. The cells of oysters cultivated in water containing
      ultrafine bubbles for two days retain their shape even after the
      oyster was frozen.&nbsp; Source: Research paper prepared by

      The many vapor and liquid interfaces of ultrafine bubbles aid in
      more effective heat transfer. The structure below shows a direct
      heat type ultrafine bubble generator, for which we have applied
      for a patent for. It can be used to very efficiently increase the
      temperature of the liquid phase. In addition, cooling the vapor
      phase supplied enables the temperature of the liquid phase to be
      more effectively decreased.<br>
      <br>
      Ultrafine bubble technology can potentially be used in a new type
      of medical treatment.<br>
      <br>
      Many medical science doctors have high expectations of ultrafine
      bubble technology. A variety of positive effects in a number of
      applications have been confirmed, and in including medical
      treatment for carcinoma of the colon and rectum, cancer of the
      esophagus, cancer of the larynx, skin cancer, gum disease,
      arterial sclerosis, infections, artificial dialysis, and barium
      meal transplantation.<br>
      <br>
      During the war ozone water was considered a magic lifesaver. Ozone
      water can now easily be created using ultrafine bubble technology.
      In addition, civilian use of technology such as oxygenated water
      containing nanobubbles and nanobubbles baths is increasing in
      popularity. The availability of simple water purification systems
      could help save up to 600 million people merely in eastern Asia.
      Ultrafine bubble technology could thus doubly contribute to
      people's health by providing preventive measures and
      countermeasures.<br>

      <br>
      <b>what are nanobubbles?</b><br>
      Nano or ultrafine bubbles have a diameter of less than 50 microns
      and unique physical characteristics that differ from other types
      of bubbles.<br>
      They are too small to rise up through liquid and get compressed by
      negative ions at the gas-liquid interface so donâ€™t combine to form
      larger bubbles. This means they remain in liquid for a long time.
      They then shrink leaving their entire gas load in the liquid.<br>
      <br>
      Nanobubbles were first discovered in 1894 when the Royal Navy was
      testing a high speed torpedo boat. Lord Rayleigh, the legendary
      classical physicist, investigated further and discovered that
      micro nanobubbles collapsed and generated high levels of heat and
      pressure.<br>
      <br>
      Nanobubbles have previously been produced in a variety of
      cumbersome and expensive ways. However now, a new, unique carbon
      ceramic technology, which works by osmosis, supersedes everything
      that has gone before. Using only a fraction of the energy required
      by other methods, this technology, invented by Nanobubble
      Solutions Limited (NBS) co-owner and company director Satoshi
      Anzai, can be used for a far greater number of applications and
      produces double the number of bubbles achieved by any other
      system.<br>
      <br>
      <b>the material/units</b><br>
      Carbon ceramic looks and feels like a smooth stone. Gas is placed
      into the diffuser head at 29psi pressure (or less) and exits from
      the whole surface of the diffuser head by osmosis. The gas is
      picked up, as nanobubbles, as the liquid passes through the unit.
      The standard range of in-Line generators come in different sizes
      to accommodate different volumes of liquid in order to guarantee
      the 90% gas transfer rate at that scale of operation. Diffuser
      heads are either small nozzle type (1 below) or plate type (2
      below). We will also design to order and offer rotary/propeller
      type diffusers that operate directly in liquid (3 below).<br>
      <br>
      <b>benefits of this technology</b><br>
      works by osmosis with no mechanical parts<br>
      can place any gas into any liquid<br>
      gas remains in liquid and in ONE PASS guarantees<br>
      a 90% gas transfer/saturation rate (double any other system)<br>
      works on very low pressure, maximum 29psi<br>
      operational in high temperatures<br>
      extremely low energy requirement so outstanding cost effectiveness<br>
      can place nanobubbles into liquids of high viscosity (think
      mayonnaise)<br>
      can easily up-size to large scale production without increase in
      pressure or energy<br>
      in-line, rotary/propeller and ultrasonic methods of delivery -<br>
      making nanobubbles available to a far greater number of industries<br>
      (for example pharmaceutical and mining/ferric leaching)<br>
      replaces or reduces need to use chemicals, so more environmentally
      friendly<br>
      electrical charge and high frequency induction heating allowed<br>
      <br>
      <b>patent protection</b><br>
      Developed over a number of years, Mr Anzai has successfully
      registered patents in Japan, the US (no 8,919,747 B2) and Europe
      for his carbon ceramic technology. Nanobubble Solutions Limited
      (NSL), is part-owned by Mr Anzai and he is also a director of the
      company which has secured the right to develop and market the
      technology in the USA, Europe and the Middle East along with
      certain other English speaking territories around the world.<br>
