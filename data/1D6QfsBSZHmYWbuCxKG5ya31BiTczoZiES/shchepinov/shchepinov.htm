      <p><i>Drinking "heavy water" enriched with a rare form of hydrogen
          could prolong our lives by up to ten years, it has been
          claimed.</i> </p>
      <center>
        <p>By <b>Matthew Moore</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>Mikhail Shchepinov, a former Oxford University scientist, says
        that the modified drink protects against dangerous chemicals
        known as free radicals that are known to contribute to
        conditions such as cancer, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. </p>
      <p>He also claims that foods such as steak and eggs could be
        enriched with the special hydrogen isotope, known as deuterium,
        raising the possibility of people being able to "eat themselves
        healthy". </p>
      <p>His research has shown that worms live 10 per cent longer and
        fruitflies up to 30 per cent longer when fed on heavy water,
        which is slightly sweeter than normal water. </p>
      <p>Dr Shchepinov, who runs the biotech firm Retrotope, now wants
        to test his technology in pet foods, and believes that it could
        one day be introduced to the food chain to allow humans to enjoy
        its benefits without taking supplements. </p>
      <p>"We don't have to be consuming isotopes as white powder. If you
        take a pig and feed these things to a pig, all you need to do is
        consume the pig in a normal fashion," he has said. </p>
      <p>But other scientists have warned that Dr Shchepinov's theories
        are far from proven. Tom Kirkwood, of Newcastle University, told
        the Daily Mail: "Shchepinov's idea is interesting but . . . the
        history in the field is cluttered with hypotheses which are only
        partially supported by the data." </p>

              water) to a longer life</font></b> </p>
        <p><b>by</b> </p>
        <p><b>Fiona Macrae</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>For centuries mankind has sought the secret of a long and
        healthy life. </p>
      <p>And for centuries it seems we were looking in the wrong place.
        Forget exotic pills and potions, the key to prolonged life could
        be as simple as a glass of water. Scientists believe 'heavy
        water' enriched with a rare form of hydrogen could add as much
        as ten years to life. </p>
      <p>And by also modifying foods, such as steak and eggs, with the
        hydrogen the way could be cleared to allowing us to eat and
        drink our way to a healthy old age. </p>
      <p>The idea is the brainchild of Mikhail Shchepinov, a former
        Oxford University scientist. </p>
      <p>It centres on fortifying the body's tissues and cells against
        attack and decay caused by free radicals, dangerous chemicals
        produced when food is turned into energy. Such 'attacks' on
        proteins are particularly damaging and have been linked to
        cancer, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. </p>
      <p>Dr Shchepinov's theory is based on deuterium, a
        naturally-occurring isotope, or form of hydrogen, that
        strengthens the bonds in between and around the body's cells,
        making them less vulnerable to attack. </p>
      <p>He found that water enriched with deuterium, which is twice as
        heavy as normal hydrogen, extends the lifespan of worms by 10
        per cent. And fruitflies fed the 'water of life' lived up to 30
        per cent longer. </p>
      <p>He now believes people could also benefit from the
        sweet-tasting water, or from deuterium-enriched 'heavy foods'. </p>
      <p>Foods could be created by either directly supplementing them
        with deuterium or by enriching the feed of farm animals, this
        week's New Scientist reports. Dr Shchepinov said recently: 'We
        don't have to be consuming isotopes as white powder. </p>
      <p>If you take a pig and feed these things to a pig, all you need
        to do is consume the pig in normal fashion.' </p>
      <p>The technology was likely to be tested in pet food first, he
        added. Dr Shchepinov runs biotech firm Retrotope whose
        scientific advisers include Aubrey de Grey, a controversial
        ageing guru. </p>
      <p>Dr de Grey, a 'bio-gerontologist' who leads the Methuselah
        Foundation, a charity which aims for 'the defeat of age-related
        disease and the indefinite extension of the healthy human
        lifespan', said the research was 'extremely promising'. </p>
      <p>He said deuterium existed in all living matter at a certain
        level and it was a case of introducing it in a 'more targeted
        manner'. There was no radiation involved, he added. </p>
      <p>Dr Judith Campisi, of the Buck Institute for Age Research in
        California, said: 'I've heard some pretty crazy ideas about how
        we might live longer but I'm intrigued by this.' </p>
      <p>But Tom Kirkwood, of Newcastle University, said: 'Shchepinov's
        idea is interesting but . . . the history in the field is
        cluttered with hypotheses which are only partially supported by
        the data.' </p>

      <p>In a back room of New Scientist's offices in London, I sit down
        at a table with the Russian biochemist Mikhail Shchepinov. In
        front of us are two teaspoons and a brown glass bottle.
        Shchepinov opens the bottle, pours out a teaspoon of clear
        liquid and drinks it down. He smiles. It's my turn. </p>
      <p>I put a spoonful of the liquid in my mouth and swallow. It
        tastes slightly sweet, which is a surprise. I was expecting it
        to be exactly like water since that, in fact, is what it is -
        heavy water to be precise, chemical formula D2O. The D stands
        for deuterium, an isotope of hydrogen with an atomic mass of 2
        instead of 1. Deuterium is what puts the heavy in heavy water.
        An ice cube made out of it would sink in normal water. </p>
      <p>My sip of heavy water is the culmination of a long journey
        trying to get to the bottom of a remarkable claim that
        Shchepinov first made around 18 months ago. He believes he has
        discovered an elixir of youth, a way to drink (or more likely
        eat) your way to a longer life. You may think that makes
        Shchepinov sound like a snake-oil salesman. I thought so too,
        but the more I found out about his idea, the more it began to
        make sense. </p>
      <p>The story began two years ago, while Shchepinov was working at
        a biotechology company in Oxford, UK, and using his spare time
        to read up on the latest ideas about what causes us to age. </p>
      <p>The most widely accepted idea is the free-radical theory. This
        holds that our slide into decrepitude is the result of
        irreversible damage to the biomolecules that make up our bodies.
        The main agents of this destruction are oxygen free radicals,
        aggressive chemical compounds that are an unavoidable by-product
        of metabolism. </p>
      <p>The reason oxygen radicals are so dangerous is that they have a
        voracious appetite for electrons, which they rip out of anything
        they can lay their hands on - water, proteins, fats, DNA -
        leaving a trail of destruction in their wake. This damage
        gradually builds up over a lifetime and eventually leads the
        body's basic biochemical processes to fail. </p>
      <p>One of the worst types of damage is something called protein
        carbonylation, in which an oxygen radical attacks vulnerable
        carbon-hydrogen bonds in a protein (see diagram). This has been
        linked to many of the worst diseases of old age, including
        Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, cancer, chronic renal failure and
        diabetes (The EMBO Journal, vol 24, p 1311). Other important
        targets of free-radical attack are DNA and the fatty acids in
        cell membranes. </p>
      <p>The human body produces legions of antioxidants, including
        vitamins and enzymes, that quench free radicals before they can
        do any harm. But over a lifetime these defence systems
        eventually fall victim to oxidative attack too, leading to an
        inevitable decline. </p>
      <p>Many anti-ageing medications are based on supplementing the
        body's own defences with antioxidant compounds such as vitamin C
        and beta-carotene, though there is scant evidence that this does
        any good (New Scientist, 5 August 2006, p 40). </p>
      <p>Shchepinov realised there was another way to defeat free
        radicals. While he was familiarising himself with research on
        ageing, his day job involved a well-established - if slightly
        obscure - bit of chemistry called the isotope effect. On
        Christmas day 2006, it dawned on him that putting the two
        together could lead to a new way of postponing the ravages of
        time. </p>
      <p>The basic concept of the isotope effect is that the presence of
        heavy isotopes in a molecule can slow down its chemical
        reactions. This is because heavy isotopes form stronger covalent
        bonds than their lighter counterparts; for example, a
        carbon-deuterium bond is stronger than a carbon-hydrogen bond.
        While the effect applies to all heavy isotopes, including
        carbon-13, nitrogen-15 and oxygen-18 (see chart), it is most
        marked with deuterium as it is proportionally so much heavier
        than hydrogen. Deuterated bonds can be up to 80 times stronger
        than those containing hydrogen. </p>
      <p>All of this is conventional chemistry: the isotope effect was
        discovered back in the 1930s and its mechanism explained in the
        1940s. The effect has a long pedigree as a research tool in
        basic chemistry for probing the mechanisms of complex reactions.
      </p>
      <p>Shchepinov, however, is the first researcher to link the effect
        with ageing. It dawned on him that if ageing is caused by free
        radicals trashing covalent bonds, and if those same bonds can be
        strengthened using the isotope effect, why not use it to make
        vulnerable biomolecules more resistant to attack? All you would
        have to do is judiciously place deuterium or carbon-13 in the
        bonds that are most vulnerable to attack, and chemistry should
        take care of the rest. </p>
      <p>In early 2007 Shchepinov wrote up his idea and submitted it to
        a journal called Rejuvenation Research. Unbeknown to him, the
        journal's editor is controversial gerontologist Aubrey de Grey
        of the Methuselah Foundation in Lorton, Virginia, who is well
        known for supporting ideas other gerontologists consider
        outlandish. De Grey sent the paper out for review and eventually
        accepted it (<i>Rejuvenation Research</i>, vol 10, p 47). </p>
      <p>In the paper, Shchepinov points out that there is masses of
        existing science backing up his ideas. Dozens of experiments
        have proved that proteins, fatty acids and DNA can be helped to
        resist oxidative damage using the isotope effect. </p>
      <p>Shchepinov's paper brought the idea to a wider audience,
        including successful biotechnology entrepreneurs Charles Cantor
        and Robert Molinari. Impressed, they teamed up with Shchepinov
        to set up a company called Retrotope, with de Grey as a
        scientific advisor. </p>
      <p>It was around this time that I first got in touch with
        Shchepinov. I'd never heard of the isotope effect, and de Grey's
        involvement made me cautious. But there was something in the
        idea that intrigued me, and I kept on coming back to it. </p>
      <p>There were obvious objections to the idea. For one, how do you
        get the isotopes to exactly the sites where you want them? After
        all, the human body contains trillions upon trillions of
        chemical bonds, but relatively few are vulnerable to
        free-radical damage. And what about safety - swallowing
        mouthfuls of heavy isotopes surely can't be good for you, can
        it? That, of course, is how I ended up sharing a teaspoon of
        heavy water with Shchepinov. </p>
      <p>Neither, it turns out, is a big problem. Some heavy isotopes
        are radioactive so are obviously ruled out on safety grounds -
        hydrogen-3 (tritium) and carbon-14, for example. Others, notably
        deuterium and carbon-13, are just as stable as hydrogen and
        carbon-12. Both occur in small amounts in nature and are a
        natural component of some biomolecules in our bodies (see "Heavy
        babies"). </p>
      <p>Deuterium and carbon-13 also appear to be essentially
        non-toxic. Baby mice weaned on a highly enriched carbon-13 diet
        are completely normal, even when 60 per cent of the carbon atoms
        in their body are carbon-13. Deuterium also has a clean bill of
        health as long as you don't go overboard. Decades of experiments
        in which animals were fed heavy water suggest that up to a fifth
        of the water in your body can be replaced with heavy water with
        no ill effects. </p>
      <p>Similar experiments have been done on humans, albeit with lower
        levels of deuterium. One recent experiment kept humans on a
        low-level heavy-water diet for 10 weeks, during which their
        heavy-water levels were raised to around 2.5 per cent of body
        water, with no adverse effects (Biochimica et Biophysica Acta,
        vol 1760, p 730). The researchers also found that some deuterium
        became incorporated into proteins. </p>
      <p>Heavy water, however, isn't completely safe. In mammals, toxic
        effects start to kick in around the 20 per cent mark, and at 35
        per cent it is lethal. This is largely down to the isotope
        effect itself: any protein in your body has the potential to
        take up deuterium atoms from heavy water, and eventually this
        radically alters your entire biochemistry. You'd have to drink a
        vast amount to suffer any ill effects - my 5 millilitres did me
        no harm whatsoever - but even so, Retrotope is not advocating
        heavy water as an elixir of youth. </p>
      <p>Instead, it wants to package up heavy isotopes in what
        Shchepinov calls "iFood". This method has huge advantages, not
        least because it allows the heavy isotopes to be targeted to the
        most vulnerable carbon-hydrogen bonds. Of the 20 amino acids
        used by humans, 10 cannot be made by the body and must be
        present in the diet. That means if you supplement your diet with
        essential amino acids that have already had their vulnerable
        bonds strengthened, your body's proteins will have these
        reinforced amino acids incorporated into them. Some of the
        building blocks of fats and DNA can also only be acquired via
        your diet, which means they too can be targeted using the iFood
        approach. </p>
      <p><b>Enriched eggs</b> </p>
      <p>What's more, this approach ought to be completely safe, says
        Shchepinov. Deuterium atoms bound to carbon in amino acids are
        "non-exchangeable" and so don't leak into body water. </p>
      <p>Another possibility is to produce meat, eggs or milk enriched
        with deuterium or carbon-13 by feeding deuterated water or
        isotope-enriched amino acids to farm animals. </p>
      <p>For now, though, iFood remains on the drawing board as nobody
        manufactures the right compounds. To solve that problem,
        Retrotope has signed up the Institute of Bio-organic Chemistry
        in Moscow, Russia and Minsk State University in Belarus to make
        customised amino acids and fatty acids. "There are a lot of good
        isotope chemists in Russia," says Cantor. </p>
      <p>Another hurdle Retrotope will have to overcome is cost. At
        current prices, a litre of heavy water will set you back $300.
        "Isotopes are expensive," says Shchepinov. "But there's no need
        for them to be. Methods are there to extract them, but nobody
        wants them." Unless demand rises, there is no incentive to
        produce them in bulk, and this keeps the price high. </p>
      <p>These obstacles haven't stopped Retrotope launching a research
        programme to test Shchepinov's big idea. A team at the Institute
        for the Biology of Ageing in Moscow recently fed various amounts
        of heavy water to fruit flies to see if it had any effect on
        longevity. Though large amounts were deadly, smaller quantities
        increased lifespans by up to 30 per cent. </p>
      <p>It's a promising start, but it's too early to say whether the
        human lifespan can also be extended in this way, or how much
        deuterium-enriched food you would have to eat to get a
        beneficial effect. </p>
      <p>"This is preliminary and needs to be reproduced under a variety
        of conditions," says Shchepinov. "It's possible that the flies
        don't like the diet, and what we're seeing is the effects of
        caloric restriction [the only proven strategy for extending
        lifespan in experimental animals]. We need to do a lot more
        experiments. But still..." </p>
      <p>Retrotope has signed up some heavyweight gerontologists to join
        de Grey as scientific advisors, including Jan Vijg of the Albert
        Einstein College Of Medicine in New York and Cynthia Kenyon of
        the University of California, San Francisco. Kenyon recently
        started work on Retrotope's second round of experiments, giving
        a deuterium-enriched diet to nematode worms. </p>
      <p>"It's a beautiful idea," says Vijg. "It gives us a serious
        chance of retarding ageing." He cautions, however, that
        Shchepinov's ideas hinge on free radicals being at the root of
        ageing. While this is still the leading theory in the field,
        many researchers argue that free-radical damage alone cannot
        account for all the biological changes that happen as we get old
        (Nature, vol 451, p 644). </p>
      <p>All of which makes other mainstream researchers very sceptical.
        "Shchepinov's idea is interesting, but we're discovering that it
        only makes sense to think about ageing in terms of multiple
        underlying causes," says Tom Kirkwood of the University of
        Newcastle, UK. "The history in the field is cluttered with
        hypotheses which are only partially supported by the data.
        Therefore, it is very unlikely that his suggested mechanism will
        prove to be more than a small part of the much bigger picture."
      </p>
      <p>Others are more positive. "I've heard some pretty crazy ideas
        about how we might live longer, but I'm intrigued by this one,"
        says Judith Campisi of the Buck Institute for Age Research in
        Novato, California and the Lawrence Berkeley National
        Laboratory, who has no formal links to Retrotope. "It's very
        original and novel." </p>
      <p>While Retrotope is concentrating its efforts on ageing,
        Shchepinov says there are other applications of the isotope
        effect he'd like to explore. One is shielding long-term space
        travellers from the effects of cosmic rays and other ionising
        radiation, which cause damage much like ageing. </p>
      <p>Oxidative attack on carbon-hydrogen bonds is a problem in many
        other areas, from drug discovery to cancer, cosmetics chemistry
        and electronics. If the ageing research doesn't work out,
        Retrotope will try something else. "We need to sort out what
        works and what doesn't, and what works well enough to be
        commercially exploited," says Cantor. "But this is going to work
        somewhere, because the basic science is sound." </p>
      <p>Sound basic science, of course, doesn't mean that Shchepinov
        really has cracked a problem that's been troubling humanity for
        millennia. Realistically, it's much more likely his insight will
        lead to a more prosaic application, such as stopping coloured
        plastics from fading in sunlight. But until he's proved wrong,
        I'll keep on hoping that I shared my sip of heavy water with a
        scientist who will be remembered long after I'm forgotten. <br>
        Heavy babies </p>
      <p>The idea of using chemical isotopes to combat ageing may be
        new, but nature may already be onto that strategy as a way of
        protecting us against free-radical attack, thought to be a key
        cause of ageing. Babies and mice are born with much more of the
        isotope carbon-13 in their bodies than their mothers, and women
        appear to become unusually depleted in carbon-13 around the time
        they give birth. Both findings suggest that there is active
        transfer of carbon-13 from mother to fetus.One possible reason
        for this, suggests Mikhail Shchepinov, chief scientific officer
        of the biotechnology company Retrotope, which is investigating
        the use of isotopes to slow ageing, is that the growing fetus
        selectively builds carbon-13 into its proteins, DNA and other
        biomolecules to take advantage of the way that heavy isotopes
        make these molecules more resistant to free-radical attack.It
        would make good evolutionary sense, as many of the proteins and
        DNA molecules formed early on have to last a lifetime. "Every
        single atom in the DNA of the brain of a 100-year-old man is the
        same atom as when he was 15 years old," says Shchepinov ( <i>BioEssays</i>,
        vol 29, p 1247 ). </p>

        </b><b><br>
        </b>
        <div align="left"><b>BACKGROUND</b><br>
          <br>
          [0002] Lysyl oxidases (LOX, LOXL, LOXL2, etc.; amine oxidase
          family) are Cu-dependent enzymes that oxidize lysine into
          allysine (a-aminoadipic-d-semialdehyde) [Kagan H M. et al., J.
          Cell. Biochem. 2003; 88:660]. LOX have been implicated in
          crosslink formation in stromal collagens and elastins. LOX are
          elevated in hypoxic tumors and affect cell motility, tumor
          development and progression of metastasis [Kirschmann D A. et
          al., Cancer Res. 2002; 62:4478]. This elevation is
          mechanistically important for breast cancer metastasis and
          invasion as well as in other cancers including colon and
          esophagus [Fong S F, et al. genes Chromosomes Cancer 2007;
          6:644], and is based on the formation of Schiff-base linkages
          (aldehyde+amine) or aldol condensation products
          (aldehyde+aldehyde), allowing cancer cells to latch on to
          other cells/tissues. There are other mechanisms of LOX
          involvement into metastasis progression—for example, the
          recruitment of bone marrow—derived cells [Erler J T et al.
          Nature 2006; 440:1222-1226; Erler J T. et al., Cancer Res.
          2006; 66:10238; Erler I T et al. Cancer Cell 2009; 15:35-44]
          for a so-called premetastatic niche formation...<br>
          <br>
          [0005] A reaction important in metastatic development. It is
          therefore desirable to reduce the activity of lysyl oxidase in
          cancer. As with any cancer treatment, it is also desirable
          that this does not completely block the enzyme activity, so as
          to minimize the adverse effects of therapy on other aspects of
          physiology.<br>
          <br>
          [0006] It is therefore desirable to reduce the activity of
          extracellular LOX in cancer. Some current approaches involve
          LOX inhibitors (e.g. ß-aminopropionitrile [Jackson L E. et
          al., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 179:939]),
          sequestration of Cu, and the use of antibodies [Erler J T et
          al., Nature 2006; 440:1222]. As with any cancer treatment, it
          is also desirable that this does not completely block the
          enzyme activity, so as to minimize the adverse effects of
          therapy on other aspects of physiology. For example,
          inhibition of LOX is known to cause increased elasticity of
          blood vessels etc., leading to aneurisms. Besides, these
          methods are likely to be immunogenic, as well as bringing
          further complications such as toxicity.<br>
          <br>
          [0007] It is known that the rate of some reactions breaking or
          forming chemical bonds is affected by the nature of the
          isotopes of the atoms, which the bond links. In general, bonds
          terminating in a heavy isotope will be less liable to cleavage
          than a bond terminating in a lighter isotope. Of particular
          note is that bonds between hydrogen atoms and other atoms are
          less liable to breakage if the hydrogen is &lt;2&gt;H rather
          than &lt;1&gt;H. A similar effect is seen when comparing the
          rate of cleavage of a bond between a carbon atom and another
          atom, where bonds with &lt;13&gt;C are less liable to cleavage
          than bonds with &lt;12&gt;C. This is known as the Kinetic
          Isotope Effect, and is well described. Many isotopes are known
          to show this effect, as is described in Isotope effects in
          chemical reactions. (C. J. Collins, N. S. Bowman (eds.) 1970).
          It is known that these effects are also manifest in
          enzyme-catalyzed reactions, as described in. Isotope effects
          on enzyme-catalyzed reactions (Cleland, W. W., M. H. O'Leary,
          and D. B. Northrop (eds.) 1976).<br>

          <b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          The present invention related to isotopically modified
          compounds and their use as food supplements.<br>
          <br>
          <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          A currently accepted theory of ageing blames the irreversible
          changes in cell machinery and reduced efficiency of metabolic
          processes on the detrimental effects of free radicals and
          other reactive oxygen species (ROS) or reactive nitrogen
          species (RNS) which are normally present in the cell as part
          of the respiratory process. ROS and RNS oxidize/nitrate DNA,
          proteins, lipids and other cell components. Of these, protein
          oxidation, which converts arginine, lysine, threonine,
          thryptophan and proline into corresponding carbonyl compounds,
          cannot be repaired by proteases after a certain threshold
          number of amino acid residues have been oxidized.<br>
          <br>
          The damaged protein loses its catalytic or structural
          activity, but proteases are unable to disintegrate heavily
          carbonylised strands, so that the damaged species accumulate
          and aggregate, clogging up cellular passages. This rust-like
          process gradually wears down all cellular mechanisms, slowing
          everything down and ultimately causing cellular death.<br>
          <br>
          Apart from ageing, many diseases such as Alzheimer's,
          Parkinson's, dementia, cataract, arthritis, chronic renal
          failure, acute repiratory syndrome, cystic fibrosis, diabetes,
          psoriasis and sepsis, to give a few examples, are associated
          with increased protein carbonylation. Typically, physiological
          levels of protein carbonyls are at around 1 nmol/mg protein,
          whereas pathological levels go to 8 nmol/mg and above.<br>
          <br>
          For the two molecules involved in the process of oxidative
          damage of proteins, i.e. an oxidizer and its substrate, the
          oxidizer has been the subject of many studies aiming at
          neutralizing or removing it by means of increasing the number
          of antioxidants (vitamins, glutathione, peptides or enzymes).
          The substrate, e.g. amino acid (AA) residues which are
          converted into carbonyls, has received less attention.<br>
          <br>
          One common feature of all the AA residues (except praline)
          vulnerable to carbonylation is that they belong to the group
          of essential AAs, which cannot be synthesized by vertebrata
          and should be ingested, e.g. consumed with food. The group
          includes phenylalanine, valine, tryptophan, threonine,
          isoleucine, methionine, histidine, arginine, lysine and
          leucine (arginine is essential for children of up to 5 years
          of age).<br>
          <br>
          Oxidation of both Arg and Lys by ROS yields aminoadipic
          semialdehyde and proceeds through sequential replacement of
          ?-hydrogens with hydroxyls. Oxidation of Lys, Arg, Trp, Thr,
          Phe and His is shown in FIG. 1. Side-chains undergo the same
          transformations if these AAs are part of
          polypeptides/proteins. Other essential AAs undergoing
          ROS-driven oxidation include Leu (to 5-hydroxyleucine), Val
          (3-hydroxyvaline) and Ile (several products).<br>
          <br>
          Other types of oxidative damages affecting essential AAs
          involve reactive nitrogen species (RNS). Examples are shown in
          FIG. 2.<br>
          <br>
          Yet another process detrimental to proteins is a ROS-driven
          peptide bond cleavage, which is preceded by oxygen free
          radical-mediated protein oxidation. A hydrogen atom is
          abstracted from a Ca, atom of the polypeptide chain, which
          then leads to formation of an alkoxyl radical. This can lead
          either to hydroxyl protein derivative, or to peptide bond
          cleavage by (1) diamide or (2) a-amidation pathway. This is
          illustrated in FIG. 3.<br>
          <br>
          Nucleic acids are not normally considered as essential
          components of the diet, but are also damaged by ROS. An
          example particularly important for the mitochondrial
          functioning is the formation of 8-oxy-G, as illustrated in
          FIG. 4. This leads to mutations in the mitochondrial genome,
          which is not maintained and repaired as efficiently as the
          nuclear genome, with detrimental consequences to the
          efficiency of respiratory processes in the cell. Another cause
          of degradation is radiation.<br>
          <br>
          The kinetic isotope effect is widely used when elucidating
          mechanisms and rate-determining stages of chemical and
          biochemical reactions. The rate of reaction involving
          C—&lt;1&gt;H bond cleavage is typically 5 to 10 times faster
          than the corresponding C—&lt;2&gt;H (&lt;2&gt;H=D=deuterium)
          bond cleavage, due to the two-fold difference in the masses of
          H and D isotopes. The difference in reaction rates is even
          higher for tritium (&lt;3&gt;H or T) as it is 3 times heavier
          than hydrogen, but that isotope is unstable. The second
          component of the C—H bond, the carbon atom, can also be
          substituted for a heavier &lt;13&gt;C isotope, but the bond
          cleavage rate decrease will be much smaller, since &lt;13&gt;C
          is only a fraction heavier than &lt;12&gt;C. See Park et al.,
          JACS (2006) 128: 1868-72.<br>
          <br>
          Oxidation reactions are a good example of the isotope effect,
          as the hydrogen subtraction by an oxidizer is usually a
          rate-limiting step of the process. Damgaard, Biochemistry
          (1981) 20: 5662-69, illustrates this: the kinetic isotope
          effect upon V/K for (1-R)[1-&lt;2&gt;H2]— and
          (1-R)[1-&lt;3&gt;H2]— ethanol oxidation by liver alcohol
          dehydrogenase (ADH) to acetaldehyde, measured at pH 6, was 3
          (D(V/K)) and 6.5 (T(V/K)), decreasing to 1.5 and 2.5
          respectively at pH 9. Lower than expected rates confirm the
          discrete role of the non-ADH systems as alternative pathways.
          In vivo experiments in perfused rat liver, as reported in
          Lundquist et al, Pharm. &amp; Tox. (1989) 65: 55-62, gave the
          mean value of D(V/K) of 2.89. Therefore, in all cases the
          oxidation of deuterated ethanol was substantially slowed down.<br>
          <br>
          Isotopically labelled material has been administered to
          animals, and also to humans, for diagnostic purposes. Gregg et
          al, Life Sciences (1973) 13: 755-82, discloses the
          administration to weanling mice of a diet in which the
          digestible carbon fraction contained 80 atom % &lt;13&gt;C.
          The additive was &lt;13&gt;C-labelled acetic acid. Tissue
          examination revealed no abnormalities clearly attributable to
          the high isotopic enrichment.<br>
          <br>
          <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          The present invention is based on the realisation that
          isotopic substitution can be used to synthesize a class of
          compounds that, when ingested, result in the formation of
          bodily constituents (e.g. proteins, nucleic acids, fats,
          carbohydrates, etc) that are functionally equivalent to normal
          bodily constituents but which have a greater resistance to
          degradative/detrimental processes, e.g. those mediated by ROS
          and RNS or radiation. Therefore, according to this invention,
          a nutrient composition comprises a nutrient composition
          comprising an essential nutrient in which at least one
          exchangeable H atom is &lt;2&gt;H and/or at least one C atom
          is &lt;13&gt;C.<br>
          <br>
          Compounds for use in the invention are identical to normal
          nutrients or constituents of food except that they contain
          stable isotopes which, when incorporated into bodily
          constituents make such bodily constituents more resistant to
          degradative processes than they would be otherwise. They
          provide a method for protecting the preferred functionality of
          natural biomolecules; the method comprises supply of a
          compound in such a way that it becomes incorporated into
          biomolecules and in so doing confers properties on the
          biomolecule that protect against damaging or unwanted chemical
          changes.<br>
          <br>
          Compounds for use in the invention may be chemically
          synthesized and, when ingested by an organism, are metabolized
          in a way that results in the incorporation of the compound
          into a functional biomolecule; the incorporation of the
          compound resulting in the biomolecule having a higher degree
          of resistance to damaging molecular changes than would be the
          case for the equivalent biomolecule that did not comprise the
          compound. Such compounds may act as mimics of naturally
          occurring precursor elements of biomolecules. They may mimic
          an essential amino acid. The organism is typically a plant,
          microbe, animal or human.<br>
          <br>
          A compound for use in the invention is typically not degraded
          by enzymes of the P450 pathway. It can therefore accumulate in
          a subject for which it is essential.<br>
          <br>
          <b>DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          The present invention relates to the fact that essential
          supplements may undergo irreversible chemical transformations
          such as oxidation, nitration, etc, leading to the onset of
          senescence or diseases. Essential food components cannot be
          synthesised de novo by an organism, e.g. mammal, primate or
          human, and therefore need to be supplied with the diet. For
          the purposes of this specification, a nucleic acid is
          essential, although it may be more properly be described as
          conditionally essential. Conditionally essential nutrients
          need to be supplied with the diet under certain circumstances.<br>
          <br>
          For humans, 10 amino acids are essential, i.e. Phe, Val, Trp,
          Thr, Ile, Met, His, Leu, Lys and Arg (up to the age of five).
          Purine and pyrimidine nucleosides are conditionally essential.
          Essential fatty acids are ?-3 and ?-6, while monounsaturated
          oleic acid is generally non-essential.<br>
          <br>
          According to this invention, the proposed undesired effects
          such as ageing/diseases can be slowed down. The compounds
          consumed should be modified to slow down the undesired
          reactions, while still retaining their chemical identity. This
          can be achieved in one embodiment by substituting hydrogen
          atoms subjected to abstraction during oxidation/oxidative
          substitution at the most reactive carbon sites, or the sites
          known to undergo the ROS/RNS inflicted damage as illustrated
          on FIGS. 1-4, with deuteriums, which due to the isotope effect
          slow down the rate of reactions. Substituting carbons instead
          of or in addition to H atom substitution may require a greater
          degree of substitution since one does not add so much to the
          reaction rate decrease (D is twice the weight of H, and
          &lt;13&gt;C is less than 10% heavier than &lt;12&gt;C).<br>
          <br>
          Depending in part of the method of preparation, a compound for
          use in the invention may comprise partial or total isotopic
          substitution. For example, deuterium substitution may be only
          at the one or two hydrogen atoms that are considered
          chemically exchangable, e.g. at OH or CH2 adjacent to a
          functional group. Total rather than partial &lt;13&gt;C
          substitution may often be achieved more effectively.<br>

          [0003] Isotopically modified polyunsaturated fatty acids
          (“PUFAs”) and other modified PUFAs for treating certain
          diseases, particularly Alzheimer's Disease, Mild Cognitive
          Impairment, Frontotemperal Dementia, Amyotrophic Lateral
          Sclerosis and Multiple Sclerosis.<br>

          </b><br>
          [0005] Oxidative damage is implicated in a wide variety of
          diseases such as mitochondrial diseases, neurodegenerative
          diseases, neurodegenerative muscle diseases, retinal diseases,
          energy processing disorders, kidney diseases, hepatic
          diseases, lipidemias, cardiac diseases, inflammation, and
          genetic disorders. Specifically, such diseases include but are
          not limited to Alzheimer's Disease (AD), Mild Cognitive
          Impairment (MCI), and Frontotemperal Dementia (FD).<br>
          <br>
          [0006] While the number of diseases associated with oxidative
          stress are numerous and diverse, it is well established that
          oxidative stress is caused by disturbances to the normal redox
          state within cells. An imbalance between routine production
          and detoxification of reactive oxygen species (“ROS”) such as
          peroxides and free radicals can result in oxidative damage to
          cellular structures and machinery. Under normal conditions, a
          potentially important source of ROSs in aerobic organisms is
          the leakage of activated oxygen from mitochondria during
          normal oxidative respiration. Additionally, it is known that
          macrophages and enzymatic reactions also contribute to the
          generation of ROSs within cells. Because cells and their
          internal organelles are lipid membrane-bound, ROSs can readily
          contact membrane constituents and cause lipid oxidation.
          Ultimately, such oxidative damage can be relayed to other
          biomolecules within the cell, such as DNA and proteins,
          through direct and indirect contact with activated oxygen,
          oxidized membrane constituents, or other oxidized cellular
          components. Thus, one can readily envision how oxidative
          damage may propagate throughout a cell give the mobility of
          internal constituents and the interconnectedness of cellular
          pathways.<br>
          <br>
          [0007] Lipid-forming fatty acids are well-known as one of the
          major components of living cells. As such, they participate in
          numerous metabolic pathways, and play an important role in a
          variety of pathologies. Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids (“PUFAs”)
          are an important sub-class of fatty acids. An essential
          nutrient is a food component that directly, or via conversion,
          serves an essential biological function and which is not
          produced endogenously or in large enough amounts to cover the
          requirements. For homeothermic animals, the two rigorously
          essential PUFAs are linoleic (cis,cis-9,12-Octadecadienoic
          acid; (9Z,12Z)-9,12-Octadecadienoic acid; “LA”; 18:2; n-6) and
          alpha-linolenic (cis,cis,cis-9,12,15-Octadecatrienoic acid;
          (9Z,12Z,15Z)-9,12,15-Octadecatrienoic acid; “ALA”; 18:3; n-3)
          acids, formerly known as vitamin F (Cunnane S C. Progress in
          Lipid Research 2003; 42:544-568). LA, by further enzymatic
          desaturation and elongation, is converted into higher n-6
          PUFAs such as arachidonic (AA; 20:4; n-6) acid; whereas ALA
          gives rise to a higher n-3 series, including, but not limited
          to, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA; 20:5; n-3) and docosahexaenoic
          (DHA; 22:6; n-3) acid (Goyens P L. et al. Am. J. Clin. Nutr.
          2006; 84:44-53). Because of the essential nature of certain
          PUFAs or PUFA precursors, there are many known instances of
          their deficiency and these are often linked to medical
          conditions. Furthermore, many PUFA supplements are available
          over-the-counter, with proven efficiency against certain
          ailments (See, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 7,271,315 and U.S.
          Pat. No. 7,381,558).<br>
          <br>
          [0008] PUFAs endow mitochondrial membranes with appropriate
          fluidity necessary for optimal oxidative phosphorylation
          performance. PUFAs also play an important role in initiation
          and propagation of the oxidative stress. PUFAs react with ROS
          through a chain reaction that amplifies an original event (Sun
          M, Salomon R G, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126:5699-5708).
          However, non-enzymatic formation of high levels of lipid
          hydroperoxides is known to result in several detrimental
          changes. Indeed, Coenzyme Q10 has been linked to increased
          PUFA toxicity via PUFA peroxidation and the toxicity of the
          resulting products (Do T Q et al, PNAS USA 1996;
          93:7534-7539). Such oxidized products negatively affect the
          fluidity and permeability of their membranes; they lead to
          oxidation of membrane proteins; and they can be converted into
          a large number of highly reactive carbonyl compounds. The
          latter include reactive species such as acrolein, malonic
          dialdehyde, glyoxal, methylglyoxal, etc. (Negre-Salvayre A, et
          al. Brit. J. Pharmacol. 2008; 153:6-20). But the most
          prominent products of PUFA oxidation are alpha,
          beta-unsaturated aldehydes such as 4-hydroxynon-2-enal (4-HNE;
          formed from n-6 PUFAs like LA or AA), 4-hydroxyhex-2-enal
          (4-HHE; formed from n-3 PUFAs like ALA or DHA), and
          corresponding ketoaldehydes (Esterfbauer H, et al. Free Rad.
          Biol. Med. 1991; 11:81-128; Long E K, Picklo M J. Free Rad.
          Biol. Med. 2010; 49:1-8). These reactive carbonyls cross-link
          (bio)molecules through Michael addition or Schiff base
          formation pathways, and have been implicated in a large number
          of pathological processes (such as those introduced above),
          age-related and oxidative stress-related conditions, and
          aging. Importantly, in some cases, PUFAs appear to oxidize at
          specific sites because methylene groups of 1,4-diene systems
          (the bis-allylic position) are substantially less stable to
          ROS, and to enzymes such as cyclogenases and lipoxygenases,
          than allylic methylenes.<br>
          <br>
          [0009] We have now discovered that oxidation resistant PUFAs,
          PUFA mimetics, PUFA pro-drugs and/or fats containing oxidation
          resistant PUFAs and PUFA mimetics that are useful for treating
          and/or inhibiting neurodegenerative disorders...<br>
