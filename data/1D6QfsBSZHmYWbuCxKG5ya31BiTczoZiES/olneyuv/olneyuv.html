    <blockquote>
      <p>This presentation deals with the prevention and treatment of
        "blocked oxidation" which we consider the prime cause of
        malignant, viral, bacterial, and allergic diseases. <br>
        <br>
        With our present knowledge it should be possible to prevent and
        wipe out cancer and serious infectious diseases. <br>
        <br>
        We are in an era of destructive therapy, powerful poisonous
        insecticides, fluoride poisoning and "embalmed foods." This is
        an era of ignoring the principles of healthful living and then
        attempting to cure everything by taking an array of pills. <br>
        <br>
        We believe that the so-called "accepted" methods of treating
        cancer are no more successful today than they were 40 years ago.
        <br>
        <br>
        We are entering on an era of prevention and simple effective
        treatment of malignant, viral, bacterial, and allergic diseases.
        <br>
        <br>
        Blocking of,<font size="-2">(1)</font> or injury to the vital
        oxidation process (respiration) of the living cells by oxygen
        deficiency or various toxic substances we find to be the most
        important cause of malignant, viral, bacterial, and allergic
        diseases. Effective prevention and treatment of these diseases
        depends upon the restoration and maintenance of the normal
        oxidation process. Knowing and eliminating the oxygen deficiency
        and these toxic substances is of prime importance, but once the
        blocking process or injury has become established effective
        means must be taken to reverse the process and restore normal
        oxidation. The condition will not return to normal simply by
        elimination of the cause. <br>
      </p>
      <p>In malignant disease, <font size="-2">(1, 2)</font> when the
        oxidation process is blocked, energy is produced by fermentation
        and viruses grow profusely in this condition. <br>
        <br>
        For many years Dr. William F. Koch<font size="-2">(1)</font> and
        Otto Warburg <font size="-2">(2, 3)</font> have claimed that
        blocking of, or impairment of oxidation in the enzymes and cells
        allows fermentation of sugar and that fermentation in these
        enzymes and cells is the PRIME CAUSE OF CANCER. Koch <font
          size="-2">(1)</font> has also proved that blocked oxidation in
        micro-organisms causes them to be pathogenic and parasitic, and
        that when this condition is corrected these organisms become
        non-pathogenic, non-parasitic, and non-virulent. <br>
        <br>
        In so many of these conditions patients have a low blood oxygen
        level as shown by blood oxygen studies. Some are only 50% to 60%
        of normal as shown in this paper. As part of this paper are the
        results of studies made in 1968 which confirm studies by Dr.
        George Miley.<font size="-2">(6)</font> <br>
        <br>
        Our clinical studies show that intravenous Ultraviolet
        effectively increases the blood oxygen to normal or near normal
        in most cases. <br>
        <br>
        Increasing blood oxygen is important, but when the oxidation
        process is blocked by certain amines it takes a powerful
        oxidation catalyst to bring about normal oxidation and eliminate
        the blocking substances. We now have an effective oxidation
        catalyst which does this.<font size="-2">(1)</font> <br>
        <br>
        In the treatment of these cases the following are very
        important: 1. Intravenous Ultraviolet rapidly increases the
        oxygen absorption of the patient bringing the blood oxygen up to
        normal. The powerful oxidation catalyst stimulates the use of
        this increased oxygen or the patient's oxygen at any level to
        restore the normal oxidation process (cell respiration). <br>
        <br>
        2. The diet of these patients is extremely important, using
        foods grown with natural fertilizers and without poisonous
        fertilizers and insecticides, and eating much of it raw. Since
        so many of these patients are deficient in important trace
        minerals such as magnesium and zinc it is important to see that
        these patients are supplied with sufficient trace minerals in
        chelated form so that they are readily absorbed. <br>
        <br>
        3. Since much of the toxic substances producing these diseases
        comes from the colon we use colonic irrigations for thoroughly
        cleansing the colon of these substances. Since the normal pH (of
        fresh stool) of the colon must be properly maintained this is
        done with every means to promote the normal physiology of the
        colon. <br>
        <br>
        4. All factors for the most healthful condition of each patient
        are carefully considered and treated. <br>
        <br>
        Pasteur was the first to discover the oxidation process or
        respiration in the cells and enzymes. Koch,<font size="-2">(1)</font>
        Warburg,<font size="-2">(2)</font> and others have firmly
        established the fact that oxygen deficiency and certain toxic
        substances block the oxidation process, and that in this
        condition energy is then produced by fermentation instead of
        oxidation. This is the pathological basis for malignant, viral,
        bacterial, and allergic diseases. <br>
        <br>
        The pathogenicity,<font size="-2">(1)</font> virilance and
        paracitism of micro-organisms is due to the same blocking of
        oxidation in these organisms. When normal oxidation is
        established in these organisms they lose their pathogenicity,
        virilance, and paracitism. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Prevention of the devastating effects of these diseases is one
        of the principle goals of this work and study. Now that we know
        these causes of these diseases, it is imperative that we put
        forth every effort to prevent them. <br>
        Treatment of all of these conditions in the earliest possible
        stages is also our goal, when these patients have not been
        subjected to destructive forces and treatments which are so
        generally used in the treatment of these diseases.

      <b>TREATMENT OF BLOCKED OXIDATION CASE REPORTS</b>
      <p>I. On January 17, 1969, Miss D.P., 38 years old, white female,
        was admitted to Providence Hospital. <br>
        <br>
        Past History: Eleven years ago a melanoma was removed from the
        right upper arm. August 1968 subcutaneous tumor mass appeared on
        the upper left chest just below the clavicle. Excision and
        biopsy of this revealed malignant melanoma. Following this she
        developed a tumor on the right chest at the same level, tumor in
        the right axilla, abdomen began to become very large, patient
        had marked difficulty in breathing, and constant cough. There
        was gradual and painful swelling of the right thigh (all at
        another medical center). <br>
        <br>
        Present Illness: On entering the hospital patient was in
        critical condition with marked difficulty in breathing, constant
        cough, cyanosis, abdomen was very large and pendulous containing
        a large amount of fluid in which there were large tumor masses
        palpable throughout the abdomen, especially the entire lower
        abdomen and lower right quadrant. <br>
        <br>
        Extremities: The right thigh from the knee to the hip was very
        swollen and painful, about twice normal size. <br>
        <br>
        Diagnosis: Generalized malignant melanoma. <br>
        <br>
        Treatment: Patient was immediately given ultraviolet blood
        irradiation (UBI) to overcome hypoxemia, the oxidation catalyst
        (Koch Glyoxylide) intermuscularly, ultra mycro-wave therapy
        throughout the body, diet consisting of raw vegetables and
        fruits eliminating all meats and fluorides, colonic irrigations
        to remove the toxic material from the colon, and large doses of
        trace minerals especially magnesium and zinc with natural
        vitamin C and natural vitamin E in addition to other natural
        vitamin supplements. UBI treatments given on January 17, 20, 24,
        and once a week following this. Koch Glyoxylide given on January
        17, February 20, March 21, June 2, and July 17. Mycro-wave given
        on January 17, 27, February 3, 6, 12, 19, 26, and once a week
        following this. <br>
        <br>
        Within three weeks the mass in the right axilla had disappeared
        as well as the tumor of the right chest wall, and the abdomen
        was becoming definitely smaller and the tumor masses much
        smaller. At the end of six weeks of this treatment patient had
        no difficulty in breathing, the right thigh was normal size and
        no pain, the abdomen had returned to normal size with no fluid,
        and the tumor masses were practically gone with only very small
        evidence of tumor in the lower abdomen. Patient up and about in
        a normal manner except for some weakness following her long
        illness. <br>
        <br>
        This patient will remain under treatment in the hospital for
        another 2 or 3 weeks when she will be discharged to go to her
        home in Utah with instructions to return in approximately 3
        months for examination and further treatment for the prevention
        of further development of malignant melonoma. <br>
        <br>
        This type of case will need observation over a period of several
        years to be sure as possible of success. <br>
        <br>
        This case illustrates the very early effective results of
        treatment of the whole program that we are now using for the
        treatment of all malignancy. This treatment is based upon the
        evidence (4) that cancer is due to hypoxemia and blocking of
        oxidation with the development of fermentation of sugars which
        causes the cancerous growth. It has been shown that all cancers
        have one common factor, and that is, fermentation of sugar in
        the enzymes and cells, replacing normal oxidation. Reversal of
        this process back to normal oxidation is all important. <br>
        <br>
        II. Mrs. A.F., age 64, white female, entered hospital on April
        21, 1953 with a rapidly developing carcinoma of the left breast.
        A few years before this she had had cancer of the right breast
        with a radical mastectomy followed by x-ray therapy. On this
        occasion mastectomy with removal of axillary lymph glands was
        performed, but not a radical mastectomy. It was found that the
        cancer was penetrating the chest wall and into the lung.
        Post-operative therapy consisted of x-ray therapy, but
        principally the program of stimulating the oxygen content and
        the use of minerals, particularly magnesium and zinc. At first
        the UBI treatments were given at weekly intervals and after
        three months they were given at monthly intervals and this
        continued on for five years. She continued to take the zinc and
        magnesium supplement and other general vitamin supplements. <br>
        <br>
        Within a few months there was no evidence of malignancy in the
        x-ray of the lung. <br>
        <br>
        This patient is now living and well and has had no evidence of
        recurrence of her malignancy. <br>
        <br>
        III. Mrs. A.R., age 60, white female, entered the hospital June
        22, 1960 with a large tender mass in the left abdomen which was
        thought to be a perinephritic abscess. Upon operation it was
        found that patient had a large carcinoma of the splenic flexure
        of the colon which had ruptured into the abdominal cavity. There
        were melostatic nodules beyond the primary growth. A Miculitz
        type operation was performed and in due time closed. <br>
        <br>
        Following surgery patient was placed on an intensive program of
        ultraviolet blood irradiation, given four in the first week and
        one each week thereafter for several months. She was also given
        zinc and magnesium in adequate amounts with other vitamin and
        supplements. Patient made a very excellent recovery from the
        surgery and is living today. She kept up with the blood
        irradiation treatment once a month for 5 years and also the
        supplement therapy. <br>
        <br>
        IV. Mrs. C.B., age 55, white female, entered the hospital on
        January 4, 1954 with a nodular tumor of the thyroid. At
        operation it was determined she had an adeno-carcinoma and
        sub-total thyroidectomy was performed leaving very little
        thyroid tissue. Following her surgery she was given UBI
        treatments, four in the first week and one each week, following
        this together with adequate magnesium and zinc therapy. This
        treatment was continued once a month for 5 years. Patient is
        still living and well and has had no recurrence of her
        carcinoma. <br>
      </p>
      <p>V. On April 30, 1969 Mrs. I.W., white female, 50 years of age
        entered Providence Hospital for treatment of a large tumor of
        the uterus considered to be carcinoma. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Past History: February 1968 patient found to have cancer of the
        cervix and uterus and was given radium and cobalt treatments for
        a month. In August 1968 she was examined again and her doctor
        told her that she had a large cancer of the cervix and uterus
        and that nothing could be done and told her to "just go home and
        die." Following this she had six months of laetril treatment.
        (All of this was at other treatment centers–not here.) <br>
      </p>
      <p>On entering Providence Hospital, examination revealed a large
        tumor of the uterus and pelvis, specifically carcinoma. She was
        given ultraviolet blood irradiation on May 1, 2, 6, 14 and once
        a week following this. She was given Koch Glyoxylide on May 1,
        6, 26, June 6, 16, she was given mycro-wave treatments on May 1,
        6, 14, 19, 29, June 4, 9, and 30th. Along with this she was
        given the diet of raw vegetables and fruits together with
        adequate amount of zinc, magnesium, vitamin C, vitamin E,
        vitamin B6. By June 24th examination revealed a marked reduction
        in the size of the tumor with only slight discharge from it and
        it was felt that it was possible to remove the tumor surgically.
        Hysterectomy was performed on June 26, 1969 by Richard C. Olney,
        M.D. and the entire uterus including the cervix removed and the
        remaining right falopian tube. Pathological examination of the
        specimen removed failed to reveal any viable cancer tissue in
        the cervix or uterus. Patient has made an uneventful recovery
        from surgery and is continuing on with a vigorous program of
        treatment to assure as much as possible no recurrence of her
        malignancy.<b><br>
        </b></p>
      <p><b>Blood Oxygen Saturation After Intravenous Ultraviolet </b><b>(Ultraviolet






          Blood Irradiation)</b></p>
      <p>Hypoxemia is a common and serious factor in so many diseases
        and surgical procedures. Correction of this and bringing the
        oxygen saturation of these patients to normal or near normal is
        vitally important in the treatment of these diseases and the
        success of serious surgical procedures. <br>
      </p>
      <p> This report deals only with the blood oxygen saturation
        changes following intravenous ultraviolet therapy (UBI).
        (Ultraviolet Blood Irradiation is by use of the Knott
        Hemo-Irradiator. A definite amount of patient's blood, 1 1/2 cc
        per pound of body weight is withdrawn from a vein, citrated and
        returned immediately to patient after passing through the
        Knott-Hemo Irradiator and thus exposed to a certain band of
        ultraviolet light in an exact period of time, 10 cc in 20
        seconds.) <br>
        <br>
        For this study twenty-three patients were selected at random
        regardless of the diagnosis in which there was clinical evidence
        of hypoxemia. Patients were selected in which there was no known
        condition which would interfere with or change the outcome of
        these studies. Before the first treatment of intravenous
        ultraviolet 5 cc of venous blood was removed and immediately
        taken to the American Optical Oximeter and the oxygen saturation
        was determined prior to the treatment. In this way the oxygen
        saturation was compared with the day previously, and the
        previous determinations, for the changes which could take place
        following the intravenous ultraviolet therapy. <br>
        <br>
        Normal oxygen saturation on the American Optical Oximeter is
        100% for arterial and 72% for venous blood. <br>
        <br>
        It is important to emphasize that in so many pathological
        conditions there is a very marked hypoxemia and that this is a
        very important factor in the diseased condition. Whether it is
        an etiological factor or a result is not important. It is
        important, however, that the blood oxygen saturation is returned
        to normal as rapidly as possible, in the treatment of these
        patients or in the performing of extensive surgical procedures,
        as a matter of giving these patients one of the most important
        factors in their defense mechanism and resistance.</p>
      <b>Summary<br>
        <br>
      </b>Hypoxemia and blocked oxidation followed by fermentation of
      sugar in the enzymes and cells we consider to be the prime factor
      in malignant, viral, bacterial and allergic diseases.<br>
      <p> A program of prevention and treatment of this condition is
        presented which has proved in the past, and is proving at this
        time to be very effective, in correcting the pathological
        physiology which has taken place and returning normal oxidation
        to the enzymes and cells for the recovery of these patients.</p>

      <p align="left"><em><strong> </strong></em><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
      <p style="text-align: left;" align="left">In the 1940s, a
        multitude of articles appeared in the American literature
        detailing a novel treatment for infection. This treatment had a
        cure rate of 98 to 100% in early and moderately advanced
        infections, and approximately 50% in terminally moribund
        patients. Healing was not limited to just bacterial infections,
        but also viral (acute polio), wounds, asthma, and arthritis.
        Recent German literature has demonstrated profound improvements
        in a number of biochemical and hematologic markers. There has
        never been reported any toxicity, side effects or injury except
        for occasional Herxheimer type reactions.</p>
      <p style="text-align: left;" align="left">As infections are
        failing to improve with the use of chemical treatment, this safe
        and effective treatment should be revisited. (Int J Biosocial
        Med Res., 1996; 14(2): 115-132)</p>
      <div align="left"><strong>History</strong></div>
      <p style="text-align: left;" align="left">Ultraviolet (UV) light
        has been known for decades to have a sterilizing effect and has
        been used in many different industries for such a purpose.
        Almost all bacteria may be killed or attenuated by ultraviolet
        rays, but there is considerable variation in the rapidity of
        their destruction. Those which live in the body are most easily
        affected, while those in nature adapt to the action of sunlight
        and become relatively resistant to irradiation.[1] LTV-sensitive
        bacteria have not been shown to become resistant and toxins have
        been found to be very unstable in the presence of UV irradiation
        (Diphtheria, tetanus, and snake venom are inactivated by
        ultraviolet rays).[2]</p>
      <p style="text-align: left;" align="left">At the turn of the
        century, Niels Finson was awarded the Nobel Prize for his work
        on UV rays and various skin conditions which showed a success
        rate of 98% in thousands of cases, mostly lupus vulgaris.[3]
        Walter Ude reported a series of 100 cases of Erysipelas in the
        1920s, claiming a nearly 100% cure rate with UV skin
        irradiation.[4] Emmett Knott pioneered the irradiation of
        autologous blood on dogs before treating a moribund woman with
        postabortion sepsis in 1933, who was thought to be untreatable.
        With his treatment of blood irradiation, she promptly recovered,
        resulting in more research and further development of the
        “Knott” technique.[5] The technique involved removing
        approximately 1.5cc/pound, citrating it for anticoagulation, and
        passing it through a radiation chamber. Exposure time per given
        unit amount (1cc) was approximately 10 seconds, peak wavelength
        of 253.7nM (ultraviolet C) provided by a mercury quartz burner
        and immediately re-perfused.[6]</p>
      <p style="text-align: left;" align="left">By the early 1940s, UV
        blood irradiation was being used in several American hospitals.
        Into the late 1940s, numerous reports were made about the high
        efficacy for infection and complete safety of UV blood
        irradiation. With the emergence of antibiotic therapy, the
        reports suddenly ceased.</p>
      <p style="text-align: left;" align="left">In the ensuing years,
        German literature demonstrated the effectiveness of UV
        irradiation in vascular conditions. Additionally, more thorough
        observations of significant improvement in many physiologic
        processes and parameters have been reported.</p>
      <div align="left"><strong>American Findings</strong></div>
      <p style="text-align: left;" align="left">The most prolific
        American researcher was George Miley, a clinical professor at
        Hahnemann Hospital and College of Medicine, who practiced the
        Knott technique at their blood irradiation clinic. In 1942, he
        reported on 103 consecutive cases of acute pyogenic infections
        at Hahnemann Hospital in Philadelphia. Such conditions included
        puerperal sepsis, sinusitis, pyelitis, wound infections,
        peritonitis (ten cases), and numerous other sites. Results of
        recovery were 100% for early infections, 46 out of 47 for
        moderately advanced, and 17 out of 36 of those who were
        moribund.[7] Staphylococcus had a high death rate, but those
        patients were also using sulfa drugs, which may have inhibited
        the effectiveness of the UV irradiation treatments. In fact,
        when Miley reviewed his data, he found that all the Staph
        failures had been on sulfa. A second series of nine patients
        (six Staph aureus, three Staph albus) had a 100% recovery rate
        with one or two treatments when sulfa was not used.[8] (Table
        1).</p>
      <p style="text-align: left;" align="left">Rebbeck and Miley
        documented the fever curve of septicemia in patients who
        received UV therapy, demonstrating detoxification and recovery
        within a few days.[9](See Fig. 1). In 1947, Miley reaffirmed his
        initial findings reporting on 445 cases of acute pyogenic
        infection, including 151 consecutive cases. Again, results
        showed a 100% recovery in early cases (56), 98% recovery in
        moderately advanced (323), and 45% in apparently moribund
        patients (66) (see Table 2).[10] Detoxification usually began
        within 24 to 48 hours, and was complete in 46 to 72 hours. Some
        patients required only one or two irradiation treatments, while
        a few needed one or two more.</p>
      <p style="text-align: center;" align="left"><b>Figure 1.</b><b><br>

      <p style="text-align: left;" align="left">Male of 20, who after
        operation was comatose, in shock, and apparently moribund, with
        a fulminating toxemia due to generalized peritonitis secondary
        to a ruptured appendix. Within 24 hours of ultraviolet
        blood-irradiation therapy detoxification was pronounced and the
        downhill course of the patient reversed. An eventful
        convalescence ensued.</p>
      <div align="center"><img src="table-1.png" alt="fig2" width="853"
          height="634"></div>
      <p style="text-align: left;" align="left">In 1943, Rebbeck[11],
        reported on eight cases of E.coli sepsis treated with UV
        phototherapy – six lived. Barrett reported in his cases of
        septic toxemia, that pain associated with infection was
        typically relieved with ten to 15 minutes of
        hemo-irradiation.[12] Toxemia of pregnancy responded in all 100
        patients with no serious complications, even after the onset of
        convulsions.[13]</p>
      <p style="text-align: left;" align="left">Spectacular detailed
        reports of hopeless cases responding to UV phototherapy
        regularly appeared in the American literature. Barrett reported
        on a patient who had cerebellar artery thrombosis, pneumonia,
        pulmonary emboli – left femoral leg, deep-venous thrombosis,
        left-sided paralysis, and paralysis of the left vocal cord. This
        dying patient responded dramatically, almost instantly, and had
        a full recovery over a period of several months.</p>
      <div align="center"><img src="table-3.png" alt="table3"
          width="469" height="418"></div>
      <p style="text-align: left;" align="left">Miley reported on 13
        patients with thrombophlebitis, including some infections. Nine
        received only one treatment, while two had two treatments and
        healing was noted within hours to two days. Most were discharged
        from the hospital in an average of 12 days.[14]</p>
      <p style="text-align: left;" align="left">In June, 1943, Miley
        reported on asthma response in a series of 80 “intractable”
        patients. Twenty-four patients were not followed up, which left
        only 56 patients to document. Of these, 29 were moderately to
        greatly improved, 16 were slightly improved, and 11 had no
        improvement after a period of six to ten months. The 45 who had
        improved remained so for six to ten months, after an initial
        series of up to ten irradiations.[15] In 1946, Miley,[16]
        reported on a larger series of 160 consecutive patients with
        “apparently intractable asthma”; 40 cases could not be followed,
        leaving 120. The results (Table 3) were better than his initial
        findings, with 32.5% apparently cured, 31.6% definitely
        improved, 22.5% slightly improved, and 13.4% unchanged. The
        authors commented that two to five treatments a year were often
        required for maintenance. Cyanosis of many years’ duration,
        disappeared within one year of therapy, and a marked increase in
        general resistance was observed; no deleterious effects were
        noted.</p>
      <p style="text-align: left;" align="left">Miley and Christensen
        reported on polio treated with blood irradiation[17] (Table 4).
        Fifty-eight cases were followed, including seven with Bulbar
        polio (40% death rate expected). Only one death occurred in the
        Bulbar group and none in the others. Rapid recovery was reported
        after the first treatment (24 to 48 hours). One to three
        treatments were all that was necessary in the majority of cases.</p>
      <div align="center"><img src="table-4.png" alt="table4"
          width="532" height="447"></div>
      <p style="text-align: left;" align="left">Effectiveness in other
        viral conditions was further documented by Olney.[18] His report
        documented 43 patients with acute viral hepatitis treated with
        the Knott technique. Thirty-one patients had acute infectious
        hepatitis; 12 had acute serum hepatitis (hepatitis B). An
        average of 3.28 treatments per patient were administered; the
        average period of illness after the treatment, was 19.2 days;
        two recurrences were observed among the 43 patients during a
        follow-up period averaging 3.56 years, one in each type of
        hepatitis. The one suspected recurrence in the “serum” variety
        was in a heroin addict and reinfection was suspected. No deaths
        occurred among the 43 patients during the follow-up period.
        Marked improvement and rapid subsidence of symptoms was noted in
        all patients treated and within three days or less, in 27
        patients. 11 showed marked improvement in 4 to 7 days, and five
        patients showed improvement in 8 to 14 days.</p>
      <p style="text-align: left;" align="left">Rebbeck reported a
        remarkable effect on the autonomic nervous system, documenting
        how postsurgical paralytic ileus could be relieved very quickly
        with UV blood irradiation.[19] He attributed this effect to
        toning the autonomic nervous system. Autonomic effects also can
        be appreciated in the reports on asthma.</p>
      <p style="text-align: left;" align="left">The authors were so
        impressed with the results that they included numerous case
        reports of hopeless and long-suffering infectious conditions
        resolving with UV blood irradiation. Rebbeck reported on its
        prophylactic preoperative use in infectious conditions,
        concluding that the technique provided significant protection
        with a marked decrease in morbidity and mortality.[20]</p>
      <p style="text-align: left;" align="left">The authors consistently
        reported beneficial peripheral vasodilation. A significant rise
        in combined venous oxygen was also repeatedly mentioned.[21] The
        remarkable lack of any toxicity was consistently noted by all
        authors. In addition to polio, Miley reported that viruses, in
        general, responded in similar fashion to pyogenic
        infections.[22]</p>
      <p style="text-align: left;" align="left">Botulism, a uniformly
        fatal condition, was treated by Miley.[23] The patient was in a
        coma and could not swallow or see. Within 48 to 72 hours of one
        irradiation treatment, the patient was able to swallow, see, and
        was mentally clear. She was discharged in excellent condition in
        a total of 13 days.</p>
      <p style="text-align: left;" align="left">LTV blood irradiation
        resulted in the prompt healing of chronic very long-term,
        non-healing wounds. [24]</p>
      <p style="text-align: left;" align="left">Miley went on to discuss
        an “ultraviolet ray metabolism,” based on the profound
        physiologic effects he noted, along with discoveries that
        hemoglobin absorbs all wavelengths of ultraviolet rays, and
        Gurwitsch’s[25] demonstration of “mitogenic rays, tiny
        emanations given off by body tissues in different wavelengths,
        all in the ultraviolet spectrum and varying in wavelength
        according to the organ emitting the rays…”</p>
      <p style="text-align: left;" align="left">A summary of physiologic
        changes documented through the 1940s included the following.[26]
        An inactivation of toxins and viruses, destruction and
        inhibition of growth of bacteria, increase in oxygen-combining
        power of the blood, activation of steroids, increased cell
        permeability, absorption of ultraviolet rays by blood and
        emanation of secondary irradiations (absorbed UV photons
        re-emitted over time by the re-perfused blood), activation of
        sterols into vitamin D, increase in red blood cells, and
        normalization of white cell count.</p>
      <div align="left"><strong>Cancer</strong></div>
      <p style="text-align: left;" align="left">In 1967, Robert Olney
        privately printed, short, undated pamphlet, sent to me by a
        friend, and entitled Blocked Oxidation, in which he presented 5
        cases of cancer, which were cured by a combination of
        techniques, including ultraviolet blood irradiation. He
        theorized, based on the work of previous researchers, that
        cancer was a result of blocked oxidation within the cells.
        Utilizing detoxification techniques, dietary changes,
        nutritional supplements, the Koch catalyst, and ultraviolet
        blood irradiation, he reported the reversal of generalized
        malignant melanoma, a breast cancer penetrating the chest wall
        and lung, highly metastatic colon cancer, thyroid cancer, and
        uterine cancer.</p>
      <p style="text-align: left;" align="left">Modern research on
        ultraviolet treatment for cancer is continuing. Edelson reported
        on a variation of the technique called extracorporeal
        photophoresis.[27] In this particular technique, a
        photosensitizing agent, 8-methoxypsoralen (8-MOP), is given to
        patients two hours before blood is withdrawn and separated into
        cellular components. White blood cells were irradiated with UV-A
        and returned to the patient. This therapy has proven highly
        successful and actually has received FDA approval for its use in
        cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL). Gasparro explains the observed
        and presumed biochemical events underlying the response in this
        condition. Such response includes the induction of cytokines and
        interferons.[28]</p>
      <div align="left"><strong>German Findings</strong></div>
      <p style="text-align: left;" align="left">Recent German research
        reports significant improvement in vascular conditions when
        using ultraviolet blood irradiation, including peripheral
        arterial disease and Raynaud’s disease. One study demonstrated a
        124% increase in painless walking for patients with Stage Ilb
        occlusive disease (Fontaine), as compared to 48% improvement
        with pentoxifylline.[29] UV blood irradiation was found to
        improve claudication distances by 90% after a series of ten
        treatments.[30] The authors also reported an 8% drop in plasma
        viscosity with the treated group, compared to no change with
        Pentoxifylline.</p>
      <p style="text-align: left;" align="left">Significant changes and
        improvements in physiologic, biochemical, and blood rheological
        properties have been observed. A summary of these effects, based
        on the works of Frick[31] appear in Table 5.[32] This article
        expanded on indications to all circulatory diseases, including
        post-apoplexy, diabetes, venous ulcers, and migraines.</p>
      <p style="text-align: left;" align="left">Frick reported an
        increase in prostacyclin and a reduction in arteriosclerotic
        plaque. The biochemical effects are generated by the activation
        of molecular oxygen to singlet oxygen by UV energy. This active
        species initiates a cascade of molecular reactions, resulting in
        the observed effects. Ultimately, this controlled oxidation
        process leads to a rise in the principle antioxidant enzyme
        systems of the body – catalase, superoxide dismutase, and
        glutathione peroxidase. Contraindications included porphyria,
        photosensitivity, coagulopathy (hemophilia), hyperthyroidism,
        and fever of unknown origin, but not pregnancy.</p>
      <p style="text-align: left;" align="left">The device utilized in
        these reports is the Oxysan EN 400 manufactured by the Eumatron
        Company.</p>
      <div align="left"><strong>Discussion</strong></div>
      <p style="text-align: left;" align="left">In the 1800s, arguments
        raged between Pasteur and his rival, Bechamp, over the true
        cause of infectious disease. Pasteur claimed the cause was the
        organism alone, while Bechamp claimed the disease rose from
        organisms already within the body, which had pleomorphic
        capability (the ability to change). It is rumored that Pasteur,
        on his deathbed, admitted that Bechamp was correct. Forgotten in
        the debate was Bernard who argued it was the terrain or
        fertility of the body, which permitted disease or allowed
        bacterial infection to take root. Perhaps UV blood irradiation
        can be explained best in the general effect of the treatment on
        the physiology and terrain of the body. For example, it is known
        that the phagocytic respiratory burst, in response to infection,
        consumes up to 100 times the oxygen that white cells require in
        the resting state. The improvement in oxidation, rise in red
        blood cells, and increase in red cell 2,3 DGP[33] may provide a
        significant boost to the body.</p>

        Modulation of the immune status (Table 5)</p>
      <p style="text-align: left;" align="left">Infection produces
        inflammation, edema, and a significant lowering of oxygen
        tension and diffusion in the affected tissues, which is critical
        to immune cell functions. Benefits of higher oxygen tension can
        be seen in the accepted use of hyperbaric oxygen therapy for
        osteomyelitis, where healthy circulation is already slow.
        Deductive reasoning would suggest that any rise in oxygen
        tension would help the body’s immune defenses. Such can be seen
        in anecdotal reports of hyperbaric oxygen therapy alone
        resolving necrotizing fascitis.</p>
      <p style="text-align: left;" align="left">German research (Table
        5) documents a rise in oxygen consumption and oxidation within
        the body stimulation of mitochondrial oxidation results in
        greater ATP production.</p>
      <p style="text-align: left;" align="left">In effect, UV blood
        irradiation therapy may be providing an inactivation of
        bacteria, a more resistant terrain, improved circulation,
        alkalinization, etc. While perhaps not as dramatic a treatment
        as hyperbaric oxygen therapy, it may provide a similar and
        longer-lasting effect through the secondary emanations of the
        absorbed ultraviolet rays. Such emissions, which last for many
        weeks, may account for the observed cumulative effectiveness of
        the therapy. UV photons, absorbed by hemoglobin, are gradually
        released over time, continuing the stimulation to the body’s
        physiology.</p>
      <p style="text-align: left;" align="left">For eons, nature has
        utilized the sun’s ultraviolet energy as a cleansing agent for
        the earth. The lack of resistance of bacteria to ultraviolet
        treatment is not surprising, since if bacteria could develop
        resistance, they have had approximately 3 billion years to do
        so.</p>
      <p style="text-align: left;" align="left">Only two discrepancies
        in accounts of this therapy could be found between the older
        American and modern German literature. Venous oxygen tension was
        reported by Miley to be increased, even up to one month after
        treatment. Frick, on the other hand, reported a rise in Pa02,
        and a fall in PV02, suggesting greater oxygen delivery and
        absorption in the tissues. A rise in 2,3 DGP can account for the
        latter. Miley recommended the treatment for fevers of unknown
        origin,[34] yet Seng’s article suggested that as a
        contraindication. Perhaps the German author feels the infections
        should be clearly diagnosed first, while Miley was so impressed
        with his results and the safety of the treatment, he thought it
        was proper to treat any presumed infection with the technique.</p>
      <p style="text-align: left;" align="left">For years, there have
        been anecdotes and reports of another oxidative therapy (ozone)
        helping a variety of chronic conditions including, but not
        limited to, rheumatoid diseases, arterial and circulatory
        disorders, osteoporosis pain, viruses, and immune deficiencies.
        Some recent findings shed light on how this particular oxidative
        therapy might help such a wide variety of conditions.</p>
      <p style="text-align: left;" align="left">Bocci has determined
        that exposure of blood to ozone at concentrations used by
        practitioners for years induces cytokines and
        interferons.[35,36] In fact, he went on to call ozone “an almost
        ideal cytokine inducer.” He concluded that such immune system
        modulation could explain the benefits of ozone reported for
        decades on a very wide variety of conditions.</p>
      <p style="text-align: left;" align="left">Mattman has detailed
        hundreds of reports linking cell wall deficient bacteria to a
        wide span of disease states.[37] Autoimmune disease may not be
        autoimmune at all, but rather an immune attack a hidden
        infection with native tissue being damaged by a prolonged or
        dysfunctional immune response to these “stealth pathogens.”</p>
      <p style="text-align: left;" align="left">The broad spectrum of
        biologic effects of these nonspecific oxidative therapies may
        explain the broad range of benefits. It is quite possible that
        all of the oxidative therapies may operate through similar
        mechanisms postulated by Bocci for ozone (namely the generation
        of reactive oxygen species, which in turn induce some very
        exceptional biochemical events).</p>
      <p style="text-align: left;" align="left">Ultraviolet has clearly
        been shown to be a superior anti-infective. It is possible that
        the secondary emanations previously described could inactivate
        pathogens deep in tissues. However, of possible greater import
        is its effect on the other various physiologic factors affecting
        the terrain. The improvement in oxygen delivery and consumption,
        rise in circulation, blood elements, stimulation of
        mitochondrial oxidation and shift towards alkalinity, while all
        nonspecific in themselves, may help hasten the cellular response
        in very many disease states.</p>
      <p style="text-align: left;" align="left">Personal experience with
        UV blood irradiation therapy has been limited strictly to an
        outpatient practice. However, I have observed significant and
        dramatic effects on pharyngitis, cellulitis, otitis media,
        wounds, viral infections, and gastroenteritis, and chronic
        fatigue. In several years of use, I have had only one patient
        who suffered from apparent chronic fatigue and failed to respond
        to a series of UV treatments; the patient had a significant
        psychological factor. Several patients with multiple chemical
        sensitivities have also experienced significant improvement.
        Chronic and intractable pain has been reported by an
        anesthesiologist pain specialist to be surprisingly
        responsive.[38]</p>
      <p style="text-align: left;" align="left">Modern medicine has
        focused on drugs to suppress symptoms or inhibit certain
        physiology (NSAID drugs as prostaglandin inhibitors,
        hypertensive drugs as enzymatic blockers) to treat disease. As a
        result, we have seen the frightening rise of resistant organism
        and the side-effects of chemical pharmacology. Perhaps medicine
        should consider the concept of nonspecific modalities that
        encourage the body’s healing response and immune system. What
        could be a safer or more effective agent against infection than
        the bacteriocidal capabilities of our own phagocytes and a
        properly functioning immune system?</p>
      <p style="text-align: left;" align="left">At least 20 American
        physicians are currently utilizing photooxidation and have
        advised me of dramatic cures of intractable infections,
        including osteomyelitis. Communications from these physicians
        are verifying my findings in the use of this modality with
        chronic fatigue. A German videotape related that several hundred
        physicians are currently employing the technique in Germany with
        hundreds of thousands of treatments having been performed
        through the years and never any reported incidents of toxicity
        (other than a mild Herxheimer reaction).</p>
      <p style="text-align: left;" align="left">“Ultraviolet irradiation
        of blood has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of
        cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Thus, the method is legal within the
        context of FDA’s definition of legality. It is also legal, from
        the standpoint of long (over 50 years) and continuous use by
        physicians in the United States as a commercially viable product
        before the present FDA was even in existence. “[39]</p>
      <p style="text-align: left;" align="left">The technique is taught
        at workshops and seminars sponsored by the International
        Association of Oxidative Medicine (telephone: 405634-1310). The
        American Board of Oxidative Medicine (a member of the American
        Board of Specialities of Alternative Medicine) certifies doctors
        in the various techniques of oxidative medicine, including UBIT.</p>
      <div align="left"><strong>Conclusion</strong></div>
      <p style="text-align: left;" align="left">This simple,
        inexpensive, and nonspecific technique was clearly shown years
        ago to be a totally safe and extremely effective method of
        treating and curing infections; promoting oxygenation;
        vasodilation; improving asthma; enhancing body physiology,
        circulation, and treating a variety of specific diseases. Its
        use in hospitals and offices could significantly reduce
        mortality, morbidity, and human suffering. Much more research
        needs to be done in determining all of the potential uses of
        ultraviolet blood irradiation therapy and also its correlation
        with other oxidative therapies.</p>

                                blood irradiation (UBI) was extensively
                                used in the 1940s and 1950s to treat
                                many diseases including septicemia,
                                pneumonia, tuberculosis, arthritis,
                                asthma and even poliomyelitis. The early
                                studies were carried out by several
                                physicians in USA and published in the
                                American Journal of Surgery. However
                                with the development of antibiotics, the
                                use of UBI declined and it has now been
                                called “the cure that time forgot”.
                                Later studies were mostly performed by
                                Russian workers and in other Eastern
                                countries, and the modern view in
                                Western countries is that UBI remains
                                highly controversial. This review
                                discusses the potential of UBI as an
                                alternative approach to current methods
                                used to treat infections, as an
                                immune-modulating therapy and as a
                                method for normalizing blood parameters.
                                Low and mild doses of UV kill
                                microorganisms by damaging the DNA,
                                while any DNA damage in host cells can
                                be rapidly repaired by DNA repair
                                enzymes. However the use of UBI to treat
                                septicemia cannot be solely due to
                                UV-mediated killing of bacteria in the
                                bloodstream, as only 5–7% of blood
                                volume needs to be treated with UV to
                                produce the optimum benefit, and higher
                                doses can be damaging. There may be some
                                similarities to extracorporeal
                                photopheresis (ECP) using psoralens and
                                UVA irradiation. However there are
                                differences between UBI and ECP in that
                                UBI tends to stimulate the immune
                                system, while ECP tends to be
                                immunosuppressive. With the recent
                                emergence of bacteria that are resistant
                                to all known antibiotics, UBI should be
                                more investigated as an alternative
                                approach to infections, and as an
                                immune-modulating therapy.</p>

                              immunomodulatory therapy which involves
                              ultraviolet A (UVA) irradiation of

                              which leads to blood clots and leaky
                              vessels. Multi-organ failure can follow.
                              Every year, severe sepsis strikes more
                              than a million Americans. It is estimated
                              that between 28–50% percent of these
                              people die. Patients with sepsis are
                              usually treated in hospital intensive care
                              units with broad-spectrum antibiotics,

      </div>
      <b> </b><br>
      A review from the Eclectic Medicine International (EMI) staff at <a
        href="http://www.holisticcancersolutions.com/"><b>
          http://www.holisticcancersolutions.com/ </b></a><br>
      <br>
      "The history of Ultraviolet treatments, or Photoluminescence
      Therapy, reaches back at least as far as the clinical use of
      medical ozone. The treatment is similar to major autohemo-therapy;
      blood is taken from one arm, it is exposed to ultraviolet
      radiation, then led back through the other arm. The two treatment
      modalities are close relatives; there are many similarities
      between them. However, there is one major difference: U.B.I. has
      been approved by the FDA, and medical doctors in the USA are free
      to use it. This fact in itself brings up some very disturbing
      questions. As you will see in this report, U.B.I., an entirely
      harmless, benign, and painless procedure, has already been proven
      very effective decades ago in reversing and completely eliminating
      viral infections that today are regarded as irreversible, and are
      treated with dangerous and expensive drugs.<br>
      <br>
      Being informed about this treatment may one day save your life, so
      let us take a closer look at U.B.I.<br>
      <br>
      Despite the fact that this modality is very little known in North
      America, it is not one of those obscure experimental methods that
      are practiced in the basements of some private clinics. Quite the
      opposite! U.B.I. has been used in mainstream medical practice in
      the United States from as far back as 1935. In Europe,
      particularly in the former Soviet Union, millions of patients were
      treated successfully with blood irradiation. One of the reasons
      for the interest in this therapy in the USSR was that it is a very
      inexpensive, yet effective procedure. Why didn't it become a major
      tool against viral diseases in the hands of US medical doctors?<br>
      <br>
      In 1998 we have received a report from an M.D. in Ohio, who has
      just finished a large clinical study with 32 Hepatitis C patients.
      He reversed all of them with ultraviolet treatments, completely
      eliminating the infection. This was very similar to reports from
      naturopathic physicians in British Columbia, Canada, who are
      regularly achieving such results with medical ozone.<br>
      <br>
      The U.B.I. equipment is being distributed in the USA by a firm
      called Foundation for Blood Irradiation, Inc. Its owner and
      medical director is Dr. Carl Schleicher. They offer training
      seminars to interested doctors. The followings are excerpts from
      their literature.<br>
      <br>
      U.B.I. Therapy is intravenously applied ultraviolet energy.<br>
      <br>
      This produces effects of a profound nature in human beings with
      photochemical, biochemical &amp; physiological aspects.<br>
      <br>
      These effects have proven to be of great value clinically in a
      wide variety of disease processes.<br>
      <br>
      No harmful effects have been observed over a period of more than
      25 years, during which UBI has been given more than 500.000 times
      to over 30.000 patients by at least 100 physicians.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Effects of UBI:</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      A rapid detoxifying effect.<br>
      <br>
      An increase in venous oxygen in patients with depressed blood
      oxygen values.<br>
      <br>
      A marked anti-inflammatory effect in diseases where severe
      damaging inflammatory processes exist.<br>
      <br>
      A powerful regulatory or normalizing effect on the autonomic
      nervous system.<br>
      <br>
      A rapid rise of resistance to acute or chronic viral or bacterial
      infections.<br>
      <br>
      UBI has excellent effects in:<br>
      <br>
      Viral infections (Hepatitis -- serum, infectious, acute, chronic,
      Mumps, Measles, Mononucleosis, Herpes, etc.)<br>
      <br>
      Bacterial infections (Septicemias, staphylococcus, pneumococcus,
      streptococcus, coli, salmonella, pneumonias, etc.)<br>
      <br>
      Profound overwhelming toxemias<br>
      <br>
      Severe damaging inflammatory processes<br>
      <br>
      Non-healing wounds, ETC.<br>
      <br>
      Treatment requires from fifteen to twenty minutes. Outpatients
      rest fifteen minutes, after which time they resume their normal
      activities. The quantity of blood withdrawn is small, and the
      procedure doesn't cause either pain or discomfort.<br>
      <br>
      <b>END OF EXCERPTS.</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      In a letter written to us in 1998, Dr. Schleicher remarks: "We
      haven't yet seen an infectious disease we could not treat."<br>
      <br>
      Here is the introduction to the 1997 Edition of a book written
      about UBI:<br>
      <br>
      Ultraviolet Blood Irradiation: A History and Guide to Clinical
      Application<br>
      <br>
      The publication of this book has been years in the making, with
      many hours of fine detective work spent in finding some of the
      missing chapters long considered lost. The Foundation for Blood
      Irradiation (FFBI), its well-wishers, supporters and staff view
      this accomplishment as a coming of age and<br>
      renaissance for Ultraviolet Blood Irradiation (UBI). Those who
      participated in this effort can be justifiably pleased.<br>
      <br>
      The writing of this manual began in the 1930's with the pioneers
      of this technique, specifically, Olney, Miley, Knott and Lewis.
      They treated thousands of patients with a broad spectrum of
      disease complaints, and closely observed these patients, often
      over a period of years. Because of their dedication and vision, we
      now have concrete documentation on the efficacy and safety of UBI.
      Their efforts have filled the pages of this manual and make a
      profound argument for UBI to become one of the more effective
      treatment methods of our time.<br>
      <br>
      Writing was completed in 1997 with the addition of Chapter 23,
      which documents recent research into the treatment of HIV/AIDS
      using UBI. This Chapter replaces the original Chapter 23, which
      dealt with diseases of connective tissue, and regrettably was lost
      over the many years since work began on this project.<br>
      <br>
      UBI was originally created through the research of E.K. Knott to
      fight the ravages of poliomyelitis in the 1930's, which it did
      with considerable success. However with the advent of antibiotics
      and the Salk vaccine this method of treatment fell into disuse
      during the 1950's and 1960's, and was for a long period of time
      overlooked by most physicians. Those who had not been totally
      seduced by the use of antibiotics continued to apply UBI and were
      soon rewarded with the knowledge that UBI could successfully treat
      many other ailments than polio, as well as those diseases not
      responding to antibiotic treatment. As news of this discovery
      spread, UBI found a renaissance in the 1980's and has been re-
      introduced by FFBI in the 90's, with an improved, state-of-the-art
      device.<br>
      <br>
      The Foundation for Blood Irradiation (FFBI), an organization
      founded in New York in 1947 by Louis Ripley, John Winters, Dr.
      H.T. Lewis and others, moved to Maryland in 1979 and continues in
      operation today under the direction of Dr. Carl Schleicher.
      Recently FFBI has obtained research reports of the use<br>
      of UBI in the treatment of HIV/AIDS; projects are currently in
      process for treating immune system disorders, Alzheimer's Disease
      and Gulf War Syndrome. While no claims can be made for UBI's
      efficacy in treating these illnesses, funds are being sought for
      research.<br>
      <br>
      Since this method uses no drugs and lowers the cost of medical
      treatment, it can be expected that there will be resistance from
      those who feel that their interests are threatened by this device.
      A similar situation occurred in the 1950's and 60's when computers
      replaced many persons doing clerical keyboard operation. Now we
      can see that computers have actually created more jobs at higher
      rates of pay than the near minimum wage of keypunch operators. It
      is expected that the same could happen here with the advent of
      energy medicine and the use of alternative, non-drug approaches to
      the treatment of disease. It should be understood that most drugs
      have side-effects and risks. UBI has no known side-effects or
      risk.<br>
      <br>
      This manual is dedicated to the pioneers of UBI and to their
      untiring search for more effective, safer, and lower-cost methods
      for healing the diseases that face humanity, using one of nature's
      own tools: ultraviolet light.<br>
      <br>
      This book is largely a collection of the documented case work of
      Miley, Olney, Lewis and others as performed with the UBI device or
      Knott Hemoirradiator, applied to a variety of diseases afflicting
      their patients. This treatment continues to be effective today
      although it has not changed in application for 50 years. There
      have been no known negative side effects, and it continues to be a
      safe, painless and easy-to-apply process.<br>
      <br>
      In his book Into the Light, William Campbell Douglass, M.D. (a
      pioneer in the new era of UV energy medicine), states that
      Ultraviolet Blood Irradiation is the life-saving breakthrough
      therapy of the age. The secondary title of Dr. Douglass' book is
      Tomorrow's Medicine Today; we concur, and hopefully this<br>
      manual can serve as a guide to continue this breakthrough well
      into the next century.<br>
      <br>
      <b>END OF INTRODUCTION TO THE BOOK.</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      If you are interested in this treatment modality, please call the
      office of Dr. Schleicher. They will be able to give you the
      address of a clinic or doctor nearest to you, where you can obtain
      the treatment.<br>
      <br>
      Is UBI an 'alternative' treatment? It is neither unapproved, nor
      actively suppressed. A medical doctor is free to practice it.
      However, it is very little known, and almost never used against
      infectious diseases, except by a handful of practitioners. If an
      excellent medical modality becomes neglected and forgotten by the
      medical community, does that place it in the category of
      alternative medicine? Hardly. Maybe we should create a new
      category: neglected medicine, or not sufficiently profitable
      medicine.<br>
      <br>
      So, if you have an infectious disease, and you are not satisfied
      with the answers you get from your doctor, it may help to talk to
      other doctors. Don't let one person's ignorance prevent you from
      recovering your health."<br>

      </div>
      <b><br>
      </b> After careful study of the literature and other information
      available to it, the American Cancer Society does not have
      evidence that treatment with Ul<br>
      traviolet Blood Irradiation Intravenous Treatment results in
      objective benefit in the treatment of cancer in human beings.<br>
      <br>
      The following is a summary of in formation on the Ultraviolet
      Blood Irradiation Intravenous Treatment in the American Cancer
      Society files:<br>
      <br>
      <b>Therapy</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      In an interview reported in the Lincoln (Nebraska Journal, August
      13, 1969, Dr. Robert C. Olney was quoted as saying that the
      Ultraviolet Blood Irradiation Intravenous Treatment combined
      several techniques developed by what he labels as several great
      scientists. These included, in addition to Glyoxylide, one of the
      Koch Antitoxins, and Ultraviolet Blood Irradiation Intravenous
      Treatment, developed by the late E. K. Knott, D.Sc. in the late
      1920's, microwave therapy, major colonic irrigations, an organic
      diet and supplements of zinc and magnesium in addition to natural
      vitamins C and E.<br>
      <br>
      In a case report which Dr. Olney distributed in 1969, he described
      the treatment of a case of generalized malignant melanoma as
      follows: Patient was immediately given ultraviolet blood
      irradiation to overcome hypoxemia, the oxidation catalyst
      intermuscularly, ultra ultra mycro-wave therapy throughout the
      body, diet consisting of raw vegetables and fruits eliminating all
      meats and fluorides, colonic irrigations to remove the toxic
      material from the colon, and large doses of trace minerals
      especially magnesium and zinc with natural vitamin C and natural
      vitamin E in addition to other natural vitamin supplements.<br>
      <br>
      In 1963, the Ultraviolet Blood Irradiation Therapy was described
      as the drawing out of some of the blood of a patient suffering
      from certain diseases and, after purifying the blood by
      pasteurization with ultraviolet rays, putting the blood back into
      the patient's blood stream, as a consequence of which the blood
      stream is sterilized of infecting organisms of various types.<br>
      <br>
      In the August 1969 interview, Dr. Olney said that Glyoxylide is a
      chemical which must be prepared with extreme care and be fresh or
      it is ineffective... He added that he had brought an expert
      chemist here the previous year to make up the special formula
      since he started using the glyoxylide muscular mi ecti on
      treatment with ultraviolet blood irradiation treatments for cancer
      patients.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Unproven Methods of Cancer Treatment</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      was recently distributed to the 58 Divisions of the American
      Cancei' Society for their information.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Ultraviolet BloodIrradiation Intravenous Treatment Rationale</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      According to information distributed by Dr. Olney in 1969, he
      believes that the most important cause of malignant, viral,
      bacterial and allergic diseases is hypoxemia, oxygen deficiency of
      the blood, which in turn deprives the cells of oxygen. He further
      believes that once the blocking process or injury whichcausesthe
      oxygen deficiency has become established, effective means must be
      taken to correct this condition, since removal of the cause will
      not return thecondition to normal. He conducted experiments and
      gave data from these which seemed to show that Ultraviolet Blood
      Irradiation Intravenous Treatment, also called Intravenous
      Ultraviolet, increases the oxygen absorption of the patient, and
      that the oxidation catalyst stimulates the use of the increased
      oxygen to restore the normal oxidation process.<br>
      <br>
      In the August 1969 interview, Dr. Olney was quoted as stating that
      more than 50 men and women have been treated by him with the
      Ultraviolet Blood Irradiation treatments at the Providence
      Hospital within the last year, coming from' 13 states outside
      Nebraska. At the time of the interview, he said he had about 25
      patients undergoing treatment with the Intravenous Ultraviolet at
      that time.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Proponents</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      In the Lincoln Journal article in August 1969, Robert C. Olney,
      M.D. is given as the founder and medical director of Providence
      Hospital, Lincoln, Nebraska.1 According to the American Medical
      Association Directory, 1967, Dr. Olney was born in 1896, received
      an M.D. degree from the Eclectic Medical College, Cincinnati,
      Ohio, in 1919 and was licensed to practice medicine in Nebraska in
      1919. He was reported to have a full-time specialty practice in
      general surgery.<br>
      <br>
      In 1963, the American Blood Irradiation Society was defined as a
      group "dedicatedto the advancement and practice of the modality of
      treatment known as ultraviolet blood-irradiation therapy." There
      is reference in correspondence to this group as early as 1953. In
      1963, Dr. Olney was given as President, and reference was made to
      seven other physicians who were officers or members of the
      Society, as follows: Drs. Armand C. Grez of New York City and
      Spring Lake, New Jersey; Basil A.Bland, Jr., and Breen Bland of
      Memphis, Tennessee; A. M. C. Jobson of Tampa, Florida; Albert A.
      LaPlume of Ville de Tracy, Quebec, Canada; Howard T. Lewis, Jr. of
      Doimont, Pennsylvania; and George P. Miley of Stephantown, New
      York. According to the American Medical Association Directorij for
      1963, all were listed as general practitioners except Dr. Jobson,
      who was reported to be a full-time surgeon; Dr. Grez, reported as
      having a part-time specialty in surgery, and Dr. LaPlume, a
      part-time specialty in physical medicine.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Litigation</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      In late December, 1963, medical news weeklies reported that eight
      physicians, including Dr. Olney, were suing the Columbia
      Broadcasting System for sixteen million dollars. In their
      complaint they charged that the program, The Health Fraud,
      telecast as part of the Armstrong Circle Theatre series on March
      27, 1963; represented the Ultraviolet Blood Irradiation Treatment
      to be a fraud and the medical specialists using it to be medical
      quacks, health frauds, and crooks. The plaintiffs were also said
      to be the only physicians in their communities using this therapy,
      and that they were therefore identifiable, even though they were
      not specifically named. Other physicians associated with Dr. Olney
      in the complaint were Drs. Grez, Jobson, LaPlume, Lewis,
      Associated Press in New York City, the case at that time, six
      years later, was ready to go to trial, awaiting call, and might be
      heard the following fall.<br>

      The physicians' complaints, filed in the New York State Supreme
      Court, also stated that all eight of them were licensed to
      practice medicine in their various states, all were members of the
      American Medical Association, and all were officers or members of
      the American -Blood Irradiation Society.<br>

      <b>NEOPLASIA CAN'T BE DEFINED</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      One of the greatest evils in modern cancer research isthe abuse of
      definitions that are based on the preconceived ideas of individual
      investigators highly expert over an extremely narrow range of
      neoplastic phenomena. Statements such as â€œ¿?Cancer is, by
      definition, somatic mutationâ€•are indefensible in logic and
      disastrous in application; they presume as axiomatic what remains
      to be provedor, sometimes, what has already been disproved.<br>
      <br>
      Somatic mutation supplies a reasonable workinghypothesis for the
      study of neoplasia; as a definition of neoplasia it is
      intolerable. No satisfactory definition of neoplasia is available
      or will be until a great deal more is known about its nature and
      properties; cancer research will have reached an outstanding
      landmark when it becomes possible to define neoplasia in
      biological terms. Meanwhile, the concept of neoplasia is
      essentially descriptive and based on the collective experience of
      many generations of clinicians, pathologists and laboratory
      investigators, but primarily on the empirical observation of
      neoplasia in man.<br>
