        </p>
        <p align="left"><b>HOW THE MUFFLER CAME ABOUT</b> </p>
        <p align="left">We have always been interested in engine and car
          performance to enhance our drag racing capability when it was
          1/8 mile &amp; then rally track driving. While I was setting
          up Engine performance, I always found exhaust systems to be of
          vital importance. e.g. low down power, or top end revs needed
          different size &amp; length systems. Street cars with straight
          through mufflers had top end power &amp; rev's, while hollow
          boxes with offset pipes, had low down power &amp; no revs.
          These were some of the options available in sports style
          mufflers, which to my mind were inadequate. </p>
        <p align="left">After some years in the automotive game and
          considerable experience with exhaust systems, I decided there
          must be a better way. </p>
        <p align="left">First we needed a muffler without square
          colliers inside so that moisture and pollutants would not
          accumulate. </p>
        <p align="left">Secondly we didn't want exhaust gases to reverse
          flow causing turbulence &amp; creating unnecessary back
          pressure </p>
        <p align="left">So eventually the Rocket Power concept was born
          with its unique solid tubular construction and special conical
          ends The inner cylinder has domed ends which absorb the gas
          pulses and <br>
          deflects the air flow through the swirl tubes.The SWIRL TUBES
          rotate the exhaust gases into a powerful VORTEX. </p>
        <p align="left">Thus the name TURBINE EXHAUST SYSTEM. The gas
          vortex generates a gas flow from the combustion chamber
          through a suction process, rather than a back-pressure
          process. </p>
        <p align="left">The end result is a brand new Technology in
          exhaust muffler systems providing excellent low-end torque
          &amp; snappy throttle response due to the streamline flow
          design. </p>
        <p align="left"><b>INSTALLATION</b> </p>
        <p align="left">In most cases simply replace the standard
          muffler in the standard position. Preferred place is situated
          before the diff, which also ensures sufficient heat to dry the
          muffler from moisture. </p>
        <p align="left">It is recommended to install a resonator before
          the muffler or at the rear, if this is not possible. ( RPM
          resonators are available from this Shopping Trolley ) </p>
        <p align="left">The Muffler has a nice sounding note a little
          like the PORSCHE. I suggest that in some V8's, especially
          short wheel base vehicles. install the DOUBLE INSULATED RPM
          MUFFLER to <br>
          ensure the noise level is well down. </p>
        <p align="left">The RPM Muffler EXHAUST EXTRACTOR system can be
          fitted to most PETROL - GAS AND DIESEL ENGINES. In fact we
          have had superb results with diesels in the 4-wheel drive <br>
          market but there is an untapped market for tractors and earth
          moving machinery where pulling power is premium. We are
          looking forward to breaking into this market, as the results
          are likely <br>
          to be quite remarkable based on all the data and experience
          that we have gained so far. </p>
        <p align="left"><b>Rocket Power Mufflers - Testamonials</b> </p>
        <p align="left">1. Holden Commodore 1985, VK, 5 litre V8 Engine
          is warmed up a little. Has extractors going into 2.5 inch
          single pipe then into a Rocket Power Muffler. RPM fitted
          February 1996. <br>
          Increased 7 bhp at rear wheels. Sounded very good, nice deep
          note, excellent power and pick up. Kym was very happy. </p>
        <p align="left">2. Holden Commodore 1991, VN, V6 Engine always
          pinged under load but when a Rocket Power Muffler was fitted
          the pinging disappeared and the exhaust colour went from black
          to grey. </p>
        <p align="left">3. Holden Commodore 1987, VL, 3 litre V6
          Replaced main muffler with a 2 inch Rocket Power Muffler. Good
          power increase, nice sound, fuel savings of approximately 15
          to 20 %. Graham was pleased. </p>
        <p align="left">4. Ford Fairmont 1972, XA, V8, auto Replaced
          standard muffler with 2 inch Rocket Power Muffler. Sounded
          good, more power, smoother gear change and 15% less fuel
          consumed. </p>
        <p align="left">5.Toyota Landcruiser, 3.5 litre diesel Has
          extractors leading into a 2 1/2 inch system with a Walker
          super turbo muffler. Once the muffler was replaced with a
          Rocket Power Muffler the car has a great exhaust note, more
          power low down and reaches maximum revs quicker. Experienced
          15% fuel savings. </p>
        <p align="left">6. Ford Falcon Station Wagon, ED, 4 litre 6
          cylinder motor. Once the standard muffler was replaced with a
          Rocket Power Muffler the exhaust note measured 82 decibels
          which was the same as the standard muffler. Fuel efficiency
          increased by 5 mpg on trips. The power button is not used any
          more. </p>
        <p align="left">7. Mitsubishi Electroserve L 300 van, 2 litre 4
          cylinder motor, auto. The van is on LP gas and is always
          loaded with batteries and tools. After fitting a 2 inch Rocket
          ower Muffler the van received a big increase in torque and
          revs. The van is going faster on the same gas mileage. </p>
        <p align="left">8. Ford Falcon, XC, 4.9 litre V8, auto sedan
          After the standard muffler was replaced with a Rocket Power
          Muffler the car had a nice clear V8 sound. The throttler
          response was amazing as it only required 1/2 the throttle
          position to maintain the same cruising speed. It felt like the
          car was going down hill all the time. </p>
        <p align="left">9. Holden Calais, 5 litre V8, The standard
          exhaust system was replaced with a set of Genie extractors
          with two 2 inch pipes leading into one 2 1/2 inch pipe and
          then into a Rocket Power Muffler and resonator. The car
          received a big increase in power and around town the mileage
          increased from320 km per tank of fuel to 410 kms. His friends
          thought he had the motor changed. </p>
        <p align="left">10. Mitsubishi Sigma, 2.6 litre 4 cylinder,
          sedan After the standard muffler was replaced with a Rocket
          Power Muffler the exhaust note changed to a nice note, the
          power increased and 15% savings on fuel consumption. </p>
        <p align="left">11. Holden Torana, UC, 4.2 litre V8, sedan.
          Craig Walkom fitted a 2 1/4 inch Rocket Power Muffler to his
          car in October 1995. In November that year he reported that
          with the car running a rich mixture it does a tanding quarter
          mile in 14.06 seconds achieves 28 1/2 mpg and up to 32 mpg on
          the highway. </p>
        <p align="left">12. Volvo, 2.4 litre fuel injected 4 cylinder
          station wagon. With the standard muffler the car would
          complete 380 km on a full tank of fuel during short runs.
          After fitting a Rocket Power Muffler the fuel mileage
          increased to 450 kms and had more torque for easier passing. </p>
        <p align="left">13. Ford Bronco, 5.8 litre V8, auto The engine
          has a 1/2 race camshaft and had a 2 1/2 inch sports exhaust.
          The sports muffler was replaced with a Rocket Power Muffler.
          The car was dynoed on the same day and gained 7 bhp on gas and
          5.3 bhp on fuel. The RPM muffler does not give full increase
          of power until the car has completed 200 to 250 kms. </p>
        <p align="left">14. Daihatsu Charade Evolution. 1.3 litre and
          1.5 litre motors. Maughan Thiem tested a number of sports
          mufflers to try and lift torque at low revs. There was very
          little torque below 3,200 rpm but after a Rocket Power Muffler
          was fitted the torque started at 2,500 rpm. Maughan Thiem was
          so impressed with the result that RPM mufflers were fitted to
          the Evolution Charades as standard equipment. </p>
        <p align="left">15. Holden Kingswood, HQ, 5 litre V8 A Mt Barker
          mechanic handyman buys and sells cars. In September 1997 he
          fitted a Rocket Power Muffler to a Holden 5 litre V8 and was
          happily surprised with the increase in power and the sound and
          it sold quickly. He removed a 308 V8 from a U Torana with dual
          exhaust system and fitted it to an HQ Holden with a single 2
          1/2 inch exhaust and Rocket Power Muffler. He claims that the
          HQ has better performance now than the lighter Torana. He
          highly recommends the RPM muffler and, has since fitted RPM
          mufflers to each car he has bought. </p>
        <p align="left">16. Holden Utility, HJ, 5 litre V8 The engine
          has a mild race camshaft with 9.6:1 compression. The Walker
          Super Turbo was replaced with a Rocket Power Muffler and a
          single 2 1/2 inch exhaust System. The ute was dynoed by Road
          and Track Services and they recorded an increase in Brake
          Horse Power from 229 to 235 at 3,500 rpm. </p>
        <p align="left">17. Chrysler Valiant, 1974, 5.2 litre V8 After
          fitting a Rocket Power Muffler the fuel consumption has
          increased from 14.5 mpg to 18 mpg. Barry feels the muffler
          should be called the 'easy breathing muffler'. </p>
        <p align="left">18. Ford Falcon, XD, 4.1 litre 6 cylinder This
          car has completed 390,000 kms without any major engine
          overhauls. The dyno tune tests show an increase of 3 kW from
          62 to 65 at 100 kph after fitting a Rocket Power Muffler. Ray
          is very pleased with the increase on performance and excellent
          fuel economy. Ray regularly travelled on a 137 km trip every
          week which cost him $23 in fuel. After fitting the muffler his
          fuel bill reduced to $13. </p>
        <p align="left">19. Ford Courier diesel utility, 1985, 2.2 litre
          4 cylinder Low end torque has improved so that he now crests a
          familiar hill at 80 kph which is an increase of 10 kph. Fuel
          economy has increased by 10%.20. Kawasaki ZX6, 1996, 600cc, 4
          cylinder 4 stroke This bike has been used for racing with a
          straight through exhaust system tuned on a bike dyno (Dynojet
          model 150). After fitting the bike with a Rocket Power Muffler
          the brake horse power increased from 97 to 99 with a higher
          power curve. </p>
        <p align="left">21. MGC GT, 1969, 3 litre 6 cylinder The car was
          fitted with two hot dog type mufflers and one was replaced
          with a Rocket Power Muffler. The car has more low end torque
          and revs more easily enabling it to accelerate up hills where
          it previously had trouble maintaining the same speed. After a
          minor tune by the owner fuel economy has increased be 10%. </p>
        <p align="left">22. Ford Falcon 'S', 1991, 4.1 litre 6 cylinder,

          Also published as:&nbsp; AU691775&nbsp; (B2) </p>
        <p align="left">This invention relates to an exhaust system for
          an internal combustion engine and in particular to a muffler
          arrangement. </p>
        <p align="left">The invention will be generally discussed in
          relation to its application to a motor vehicle internal
          combustion engine exhaust system but it will be realized that
          it is equally applicable to other forms of engines such as
          stationary engines. The invention may be applied to motor
          cycles, motor cars or trucks. </p>
        <p align="left"><b>Background of the Invention</b> </p>
        <p align="left">An exhaust muffler for a motor vehicle has the
          main function of reducing the sound of an engine while at the
          same time not causing too much back pressure to the flow of
          exhaust from the engine. </p>
        <p align="left">It is the object of this invention to provide an
          exhaust muffler which has good sound absorbent qualities while
          at the same time providing minimal back pressure thereby
          enhancing the efficiency of a motor vehicle upon which it is
          used or to at least provide the public with a useful
          alternative. </p>
        <p align="left"><b>Brief Summary of the Invention</b> </p>
        <p align="left">In one form therefore although this may not
          necessarily be the only or broadest form, the invention is
          said to reside in an exhaust muffler for an internal
          combustion engine, the exhaust muffler comprising a casing,
          the casing including a tapered outlet end terminating in an
          outlet pipe and an inlet pipe at the inlet end, an elongate
          cylindrical core having closed ends within the casing, the
          elongate core being hollow and the cylindrical surface of the
          core being perforated, the casing and the elongate core
          defining between them an annular exhaust flow region through
          which exhaust gases flow in use, and a plurality of vanes
          extending between the core and the casing in the annular
          exhaust flow region, the vanes being so shaped that they are
          adapted to cause a swirling of the flow of exhaust in the
          annular exhaust flow region in use. </p>
        <p align="left">It will be seen that by this invention therefore
          there is provided an exhaust muffler which has an essentially
          straight through flow path only interrupted by vanes which
          cause a swirling or helical flow of exhaust through the
          exhaust muffler thereby providing minimal back pressure. In
          fact the helical flow of the exhaust appears to actually
          encourage flow and draw exhaust through the exhaust muffler
          and in fact considerable reduction in back pressure is found
          in practice. </p>
        <p align="left">Preferably the casing is cylindrical with
          frusto-conical tapered outlet ends and inlet ends. This helps
          to provide for a smooth flow of exhaust into and out of the
          muffler. </p>
        <p align="left">The inlet end may be domed rather than
          frusto-conical in shape or may even have a stepped inlet end
          between the inlet pipe and the casing because flow in this
          region is not so critical. </p>
        <p align="left">The elongated core may be perforated so as to
          have u[p to 50 percent surface area of apertures. In one
          preferred embodiment the apertures amy be each holes of
          approximately 3 millimeters diameter. </p>
        <p align="left">The elongated core may have domed ends to assist
          with flow into and out of the annular exhaust flow region.
          Alternatively one or both of the ends of the elongated core
          may be tapered to a conical shape. </p>
        <p align="left">In one preferred embodiment the inlet end may be
          domed and the outlet end tapered. </p>
        <p align="left">The elongated core may be filled with an
          absorbent material so that some degree of sound absorption can
          occur in the elongated core. In one preferred embodiment the
          energy absorbent is long strand glass fiber although other
          materials which of course would clearly have to be heat
          resistant could be used. </p>
        <p align="left">The vanes may be helical or spiral and there may
          be two, three or four vanes around the periphery of the
          elongated core. </p>
        <p align="left">In one preferred embodiment of the invention
          there may be a first set of four vanes at the inlet end of the
          elongated core being helical in configuration and extending
          approximately one-third of the length of the elongated core
          and then a second set of four vanes terminating at the outlet
          end of the elongated core again approximately one-third of the
          length of the elongated core. </p>
        <p align="left">This has been found to be a sufficient number of
          vanes. </p>
        <p align="left">The vanes may be plates or tubes. </p>
        <p align="left">In a preferred embodiment the casing may
          comprise an inner wall spaced apart from an outer wall
          defining a space therebetween and with the inner wall being
          perforated. The space between the inner wall and the outer
          wall may be filled with fiber glass mat. </p>
        <p align="left">A typical exhaust muffler according to this
          invention may have a casing with an outside diameter of 125
          millimeters and 350 millimeters long and an elongated core 100
          millimeters in outside diameter and 350 millimeters long. Each
          of the vanes may be made from 12 mm diameter tube 110 mm long
          which are curved and then welded to the surface of the
          elongated core. The ends of the casing may be frusto-conical
          approximately 124 mm long terminating in inlet or outlet pipes
          50 mm or 75 mm in diameter. </p>
        <p align="left">Using an exhaust muffler of construction of the
          present invention it has been found that there has been
          increased torque available from an engine and increased
          horsepower which has provided an improved fuel consumption for
          the vehicle. Although no quantitative sound tests have been
          done it does appear that the amount of sound absorption is at
          least as good as existing types of mufflers. </p>
        <p align="left">This then describes the invention but to assist
          with understanding references will now be made to the
          accompanying&nbsp; drawings which show preferred embodiments
          of the invention. </p>

        <p align="left">Now looking more closely at the drawings it will
          seem that the exhaust muffler shown in the embodiment shown in
          Fig. 1 comprises a casing 1 having a frusto-conical shaped
          inlet end 2 and frusto-conical shaped outlet end 3. An inlet
          pipe 4 enters the exhaust muffler and outlet pipe 5 exits the
          muffler. Within the casing is an elongated core 6 which has
          dome shaped inlet end 7 and a dome shaped outlet end 8. Pieces
          of piping are bent with a substantially helical form to
          provide vanes 9 at the inlet end of the elongated core and
          vanes 10 at the outlet end of the elongated core. </p>
        <p align="left">In the embodiment shown in Fig 2 the
          construction is essentially similar although there is a domed
          inlet end 20 to the casing 22 and a conical outlet end 21 to
          the elongated core 23. </p>
        <p align="left">In the embodiment shown in Fig 3 the vanes 25 of
          a substantially helical configuration are comprised of plates
          extending between the elongated core 26 and the casing 27. </p>
        <p align="left">In Fig 4 which is a cross section on the line
          4-4’ in Fig 1 it will be seen that the elongated casing 6 is
          filled with long strand glass fibers 27. </p>
        <p align="left">In Fig 5 it will be seen that in one embodiment
          the outer casing is comprised of an outer layer 30 and an
          inner layer 31 with the inner layer being perforated and
          having perforations 32 to assist in the absorption of sound
          emanating from the muffler. In the space between the inner and
          outer wall may be a packing 33 comprised of a suitable
          material such as fiber glass mat. Preferably the perforation
          may provide up to 40% open spaces in the inner wall. </p>
        <p align="left">The construction of the muffler and in
          particular defining the space between the inner and the outer
          wall may be achieved by fitting by welding the inner wall on
          the inside of the extremity of the end cone 34 and fitting by
          welding the outer wall to the outside of the extremity of the
          end cone 34. </p>
        <p align="left">The exhaust muffler of this present invention
          may be constructed from steel or stainless steel or any other
          suitable material and may be of welded or other suitable
          construction. The inlet and outlet pipes may be constructed
          for flange slip or welded joining to exhaust pipes of an
          internal combustion engine. </p>
        <p align="left">Throughout this specification unless the context
          requires otherwise, the words ‘comprise’ and ‘including’ will
          be understood to imply the inclusion of a stated integer or
          group of integers but not the exclusion of any other integer
          or group of integers. </p>
