      Japan Techno, Inc. is in Ohta, Tokyo, Japan.<br>
      <br>
      The president of the company, Ohmasa, made a fluid stirrer that
      doesn't use rotation of the blade but uses mechanical vibrations
      of low frequency instead.<br>
      <br>
      The water circulation has good stability.<br>
      <br>
      If you pour detergent into this water, bubbles don't occur. Why?<br>
      <br>
      Ordinary electrolysis makes O2 and H2 gas.<br>
      <br>
      When President Ohmasa did plating work in this stirrer, neither an
      explosion nor a bubble appeared.<br>
      <br>
      They say that this low frequency vibration breaks water surface
      tension, so bubbles can't occur.<br>
      <br>
      President Ohmasa got a hunch. He did electrolysis in this 'water
      of broken surface tension', then Special Water Gas occurred. This
      gas is different from ordinary hydrogen and oxygen gas.<br>
      <br>
      This Special Water Gas can occur only in the low frequency
      vibration water. The Special Water Gas occurs as micro
      nanobubbles, which gas is completely different from ordinary
      hydrogen and oxygen. It provides a safe gas for fuel, which is a
      combination of hydrogen and oxygen, which under normal conditions
      would want to recombine explosively.<br>
      <br>
      Hydrogen gas is a very small molecule, which leaks from most
      containers easily. But this Special Water Gas has been in a gas
      cylinder of a fixed pressure for two years.<br>
      <br>
      President Ohmasa says that the ratio of hydrogen and oxygen is
      2:1, but its structure must be special.<br>
      <br>
      Special Water Gas can be used as a fuel for a torch. The
      temperature is about 700 degrees Celcius, which is a lower
      temperature compared to other torches. But it can burn through an
      iron plate.<br>
      <br>
      New uses begin to be born.<br>
      <br>
      Dr. Masanori Ito of the University of Tokyo Kaiyoh has succeeded
      to run a small engine as of July, 2009. The air intake for this
      engine was closed. It does not require oxygen (from the air) to
      burn this Special Water Gas. The exhaust is water vapor.<br>
      <br>
      This Special Water Gas doesn't explode under pressure. It is very
      stable.<br>
      <br>
      It is possible to make societal infrastructure of Special Water
      Gas instead of gasoline.<br>
      <br>
      President Ohmasa ran liquefaction tests to ascertain the true
      character of the gas. Normally, oxygen liquifies at -183º C, and
      hydrogen liquiefies at -253º C. However, this Special Water Gas
      liquefies at -178º C.<br>
      <br>
      President Ohmasa says:<br>
      <br>
      "I don't know the certain molecular structure, but we get a second
      water [type] on the Earth. All internal-combustion engines and
      generators can&nbsp; use this water fuel, exhausting water vapor.
      We want to make the water fuel that saves the Earth." <br>
      <br>
      It's likely, though, that this technology may yet met resistance
      from the mental blocks that exist.<br>
      <br>
      Water fuel does not produce harmful exhaust. It is a clean source
      of energy.<br>
      <br>
      Japan Tech Inc. is going to test a bigger four-cycle car engine
      next month (November, 2009). If it succeeds, a new fuel will be
      born. <br>

      Dear Friends...<br>
      At the first day of the "Water and Peace" Global Forum which was
      held from March 20th to 22nd this year, Mr. Ryushin Omasa, the
      president of Japan Techno Co, gave a lecture about his technology
      which extracts alternative energy called Ohmasa gas from water.
      This alternative energy can be substituted for petroleum energy.
      He applies specific low frequencies to water and agitated it to
      chemically dissolve the water. The oxygen and the hydrogen
      generated a unified oxy-hydrogen in a safe format, and this
      oxy-hydrogen solution can create fire to weld with and energy to
      run a motor. They already succeeded in running a motorbike with
      this Ohmasa gas... <br>

      <br>
      Mr. Ohmasa, president of Japan Techno, has devised a method of
      producing an unusual hydrogen-oxygen gas that could become an
      alternative fuel of the future, conceivably replacing gasoline,
      both due to its burning characteristics as well as its ease of
      storage and transport.<br>
      <br>
      One patented process developed by Ohmasa uses low frequency
      vibrations to circulate water without any other stirring
      mechanism. Such water has reduced surface tension to the point
      that bubbles do not form in the water when detergent is added to
      it, though it is being agitated by the circulation. However, it
      turns out that bubbles are forming, but they are not visible
      because they are tiny -- on the nano scale.<br>
      <br>
      Ohmasa discovered that if he performs electrolysis on this water
      solution, that a highly stable H2-O2 gas is formed, subsequently
      named Ohmasa gas, which exhibits unusual characteristics. For
      example, Ohmasa gas doesn't explode under pressure, but only
      recombines when ignited. Also, while oxygen normally liquifies at
      -183º C, and hydrogen liquiefies at -253º C, Ohmasa gas liquefies
      at -178º C. Also, the Ohmasa gas does not escape from containers
      that hold oxygen but not normal hydrogen; it holds its pressure in
      the container, making storage and shipment feasible. Similar to
      Brown's Gas, one can wave their hand through the Ohmasa gas torch
      flame, yet that same flame will vaporize Tungsten in a second.<br>
      <br>
      When Ohmasa gas is burned, its emission is water vapor.<br>
      <br>
      Hence, with this new method, water could conceivably become the
      energy carrier of choice for energy produced from renewable
      sources such as solar and wind. Some modifications would likely
      need to be made to existing engines for it to work well with them,
      and it would require new tanks (gaseous rather than liquid), and
      new dispensing orifices. <br>

      <b> </b><b> Abstract</b><br>
      The gas emitted from popular water electrolyzer projects manifests
      unusual energetic anomalies, which include vaporizing tungsten
      when used in a welding torch and running internal combustion
      engines on small quantities of the gas. Some claim to run
      generators in closed loop fashion solely on the gas from the
      electrolyzer, which is powered solely from the generator. Most
      investigators believe the energy is from burning hydrogen. A
      hypothesis is proposed that the dominant energy is not coming from
      hydrogen, but rather it is coming from charged water gas clusters,
      which activate and coherently trap zero-point energy.<br>
