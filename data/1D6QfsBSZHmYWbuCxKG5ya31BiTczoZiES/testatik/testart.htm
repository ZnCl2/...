        &amp; Hans Holzherr</b></center>
    <blockquote>From: Hans Holzherr <br>
      To: Stefan Hartmann
      <p>Recently, over 30 technicians and engineers (most of them
        retired) were allowed to visit the Methernitha group in Linden,
        Switzerland, where they witnessed a demo of the different
        Testatika machines. </p>
      <p>Here is a report from Hans Holzherr from Switzerland who was
        present: </p>
      <p>Hello Mr. Hartmann, </p>
      <p>To your questions: &gt; Have you seen live a machine with a
        load? If so, what&nbsp; load? </p>
      <p>I am referring in the following to the model with the 50-cm
        diameter disks. This machine was already running when the
        visitors stepped into the room, and was not halted during the
        whole time --- we were there for about&nbsp; 1.5 hrs. As a first
        load a 1000-Watt lamp was connected for approximately 10 seconds
        whose brightness did NOT diminish --- the corresponding sequence
        on the Testatika film is just an effect of the camera aperture's
        automatic adjusting to the sudden brightness! The second load
        was a U-shaped heating element, that Mr.Baumann handed to me. It
        became so hot within one second that I had to put it down
        immediately! What was particularly impressive was that while he
        pulled back one of the contact wires (that was with the lamp, I
        believe), a 1-cm long arc appeared between the output electrode
        and the connecting wire for approximately one second. The
        apparatus was under a plexiglass hood. Near the base it had two
        holes which Baumann used to insert the contact wires to touch
        the output electrodes. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;How do you think the high wattage is produced ? </p>
      <p>Good question! I'd love to know the answer, too! </p>
      <p>&nbsp;Did the disks slow down when a load was placed across the
        output electrodes ? </p>
      <p>I did not notice that (nobody else did), but of course you tend
        to turn your look to 'where the action is' (the lamp etc.) The
        disks turned with 15 rpm, which is quite slow. The spin rate was
        regulated magnetically. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;What&nbsp; general impression did you have ? </p>
      <p>It was really impressive! One can hardly believe it, with this
        slow rotation. In any case, this cannot be explained in terms of
        bare electrostatics in the sense of the Wimshurst machine. The
        perforated sheets seem to have a key function... Beside the
        pick-up and the drive electrodes there are a number of small
        plexiglass blocks with glued-on perforated sheets, whose
        function is unknown. </p>
      <p>As Adolf Schneider already mentioned, my colleague Bernhard XXX
        and I want to try to copy the principle experiment shown by
        Baumann --- without much hope to find anything extraordinary,
        though. </p>
      <p>The device consists of a horizontal swiveling plexiglass arm
        with a small rectangular plexiglass plate at both ends glued to
        the lower side of the arm. The lower side of the arm is covered
        with perforated aluminum sheets (square holes), while the bottom
        of the plates is covered with brass wire mesh. Beneath each
        plate five additional plates are glued onto the base plate.
        There is also wire mesh between each pair of plates in the two
        blocks. From the mesh layer between the lowest plate and the
        base a wire goes to the two capacitors, which are connected in
        parallel . Baumann seized the arm with both hands and turned it
        about ten times back and forth (a full rotation was not
        possible, because the capacitors were in the way), then measured
        the DC voltage with a digital measuring instrument: 60 Volts.
        Then, as he short-circuited the condensers a loud crack could be
        heard. I don´t know if that already is an abnormal result... </p>
      <p>On my question Baumann replied that with metal foil (instead of
        wire mesh) the device would not produce that effect. </p>

      <p>That the Swiss Methernitha group's Testatika machine is thought
        to be based on a Wimshurst electrostatic generator, is only a
        sparse approximation of the truth --- of the great multitude of
        electrostatic influence machines developed around the 1900's it
        more closely follows the charge-separation-and-collection system
        used by the 1898 Pidgeon machine [note 1] for its electrical
        circuit. </p>
      <p>Its 50-per-disc steel grilles or 'gitter-grilles' are plainly
        unique to the Methernitha (see fig.1) but in principle follow on
        from previous research and patents for corrugated sectors which
        were found to be more efficient charge carriers [note 2] than
        flat ones, and from a similar example in more recent times of
        aluminium rods extending out like wheel spokes from an
        insulating hub of perspex [note 3]. </p>
      <p>Another unique function of these perforated grilles attached to
        the discs is how they induce charge from the rotating discs onto
        the special collecting pads, or 'tasten' antennae keys (which
        are also perforated --- so as to more readily pick up charge);
        for in a Wimshurst you had conductive brushes or rails of sharp
        points which actually touched the discs or were placed very
        close to them, but in the Methernitha the charge has to be made
        to traverse a parallel air-gap to the pads and for this purpose
        the metal gitter-grilles are so designed to create miniature
        eddy-currents of charged air which circulate in and out of the
        perforated metal's surface charges, and are more easily bounced
        out to the collecting pads. This process is categorised as
        VARIABLE CAPACITANCE electrostatic generation. </p>
      <p>Careful note needs to be made of how the Methernitha uses its
        basically Pidgeon setup with regard to its neutralising rods
        (that equalise and stabilise the opposite charges --- see
        fig.2), and how charges are picked up from one area and
        accumulated at others, so that the polarities of charge are
        distributed correctly to specific areas on both discs [note 4].
      </p>
      <p>And although there have been some fanciful claims, or
        misinformation, that it uses all sorts of radioactive materials
        to achieve its pulsed output I most strongly believe that the
        auxiliary electromagnetic circuit, that wraps itself around the
        rotating discs, portrays a simple electronic approach; afterall,
        who would use radium radioactive emission alongside leyden jar
        capacitors ! Indeed, the more you look into certain elements of
        its construction the more they point to three main eras of
        electronics development, the 1900's, the 1920's and the
        1950/60's. The authentic Methernitha was designed and developed
        by purists who believed they had discovered a previously unknown
        electronic phenomenon, but they wanted to keep an integrity to
        the early pioneering days of the Pidgeon, Wimshurst and Holtz
        electrostatic machinery; they would not use such modern devices
        as transistors or IC chips (more's the pity) --- but they do use
        some pretty uncommon electronic engineering in their circuit
        [note 5]. </p>
      <p>Obviously, the electronics are in two parts; one --- the
        electrostatic generator and its particular technologies of how
        to direct what charge where, and two --- the very unique
        auxiliary electromagnetic circuit of inductances, capacitances
        and rectification that mobilises that 'static' electricity. To
        understand how they convert static energy into an electromotive
        force you would do well to go back to the earliest years of
        radio. From the pages of spark radio you soon appreciate just
        how important oscillation circuits and their valve rectifiers
        were, and moreover, how difficult it proved to engineer them.
        For although radio transmitters and receivers from the 1900's
        used resonating circuits their oscillations were controlled by
        sparks between two contacts and, of course, they were relatively
        inefficient. Not until the 1920's did the first electric current
        oscillations become an observable controlled phenomenon when
        someone coupled a rectifier valve, a capacitor, and a resistor
        together [note 6]. The early 1920's also saw the best era of
        experimentation and invention for novel devices that turned
        static energy into useable electromagnetic energy; it was in a
        1921 patent that we see a German physicist Hermann Plauson
        describe in great detail his methods to convert static power,
        not only from rotary influence machines but also from balloons
        collecting atmospheric electricity up in the sky; and by using
        thermionic rectifiers, leyden jar capacitors and inductor coils
        he proposed a free-energy network that was to power the whole of
        Germany [note 7] ! The thermionic rectifier valve heralded a new
        era for radio and high voltage physics, and as it was then
        subjected to such a broad array of experiments and modifications
        to improve its efficiency so it paved the way for all sorts of
        new avenues in electronics. Indeed, with such a technical
        catalogue of similarities with what we see in the available
        photographs of Testatika it can be assumed without doubt that
        the horizontal glass tube which sits on top of the Methernitha
        machines is exactly what a home-made vacuum thermionic
        rectifying valve would look like; with its internal anode
        mesh-plate, surrounded by a coiled copper grid, fed by a glowing
        (heated) cathode wire running horizontally across its centre and
        capped by two black end-pieces, which are too big and bulbous to
        be mere end-caps and must surely be black rubber vacuum seals to
        seal the glass tube and the input/output wires [note 8]. </p>
      <p>With such a rectifier, some induction coils, and some leyden
        jar capacitors you have a circuit that oscillates, and that's
        what has to happen with a Methernitha, the electromagnetic
        circuit has to oscillate for it to work, and then the
        oscillations have to be rectified (or even modulated) so that
        the resulting single-pole pulses can be channeled through the
        big cans, which are basically high-efficiency transformers, and
        outputted as reduced voltage higher current DC pulses (see
        fig.3). </p>
      <p>The precise components used to oscillate the primary
        oscillating circuit are, I believe, not to be seen in any of the
        available photographs, but there are various hints for their
        approximate whereabouts on the machine. Firstly, according to
        electronic design there should be a capacitor and coil
        configuration in close proximity to the rectifier. Well, from
        the picture "3KWREAR" can be seen the two long upright tubes
        which, according to those who have seen them first-hand,
        comprise a spirally turned aluminium strip (which indicates they
        are chokes [note 9]) inside a glass tube, inside the same sort
        of outer shielding that the big cans have (which indicates they
        are electrostatic shields), inside yet another glass tube, and
        are terminated at the top with a brass connecting rod which does
        a right-angled turn and passes into the side of the tower ---
        but only two-thirds up the height of the tower. These two
        assemblies must form a connection to the rectifier, because the
        rectifier is at the top of the tower, so why don't these
        electrostatically sensitive tubes extend all the way up to it ?
        Again, from the photographs of the rear and front of the
        Methernithas there is a wire that comes out of the tower's side
        wall at about 4 inches above the upright's brass terminals and
        this wire then passes through a short black tube and on to the
        rectifier valve. This, of course, would happen on both sides of
        the tower, enabling a connection to both ends of the rectifier.
        But why have this 4 inch gap of connections at the top of the
        tower ? Something is placed inside the top of the tower in this
        intermediate space which is very necessary to the circuit, and I
        think it must be the location of the capacitor/inductor
        configuration to oscillate the circuit. This (fig.4) is how I
        would see the inside of the top of the towers [note 10]. </p>
      <p>I've seen some of the patented inventions that rotate discs ---
        by using magnets (i.e.,&nbsp; H.Rosenberg's permanent magnet
        excited rotational machine, US Patent # 3,411,027 ), and by
        utilising inscribed metalised discs (US Patent # 3,239,705 for
        instance), but there simply isn't enough room for these to be
        located in the Methernitha disc setup --- also, you don't want
        to interfere with the ES fields that zip around the revolving
        discs: From the reports of those who have seen the small
        machines working it appears their discs were rotated by small DC
        electric motors after they were hand-started, some re-wound with
        thinner wire (to presumably increase their torque) and powered
        directly from the discs' generated electricity --- but I have
        also seen how two discs can continue to rotate simply by careful
        placement of curved electrodes [note 11] which would act on the
        charges on the discs --- like the 3kw Testatica Distatica
        generators. </p>
      <p>After reading through the many early accounts of electrostatic
        rotary machines, and some of the more recent ones, you can't
        help but be puzzled by the Methernitha's incredibly low
        rotational speed of just 60 rpm (and in the 1999 engineers
        report as low 15 rpm !). Most other early experimenters boasted
        up to 3000 rpm. J.G.Trump in his work on high voltage generation
        in space [note 12] spun his rotary machine at 10,000 rpm (to
        produce 433 Watts at 24 KV no less). One reason for this low
        speed might be to do with the close proximity of the 50 lamellas
        (gitter-grilles) on the discs at their inner ends, they are very
        close together, I think too close. Air, normally an insulator,
        breaks down and conducts at around 25-35 KV (this figure has
        been fairly constant from day-one of electrostatic machine
        experiments right through to the present day --- because air has
        a breakdown field strength of 3x106 volts/metre) and
        short-circuits the circuit. I feel that because this design of
        grilles is prone to short-circuiting at high voltages the
        Methernitha people have limited their rotational speed so as to
        ensure a low operating voltage --- of what I'd guesstimate to be
        only 12 to 24KV. </p>
      <p>But, is this a waste of extra potential ? Not necessarily, for
        I don't think that the main power output comes solely from what
        the two counter-rotating discs supply. </p>
      <p>There is, I believe, a far more important power generator ---
        the electron cascade generator, and the Methernitha has two of
        them, held inside the two horseshoe magnets, and providing the
        circuits to the magnets are made to oscillate at the right
        frequency at a high enough voltage then these metalised-perspex
        laminated blocks can enmass A MUCH LARGER AMOUNT OF ELECTRICITY
        THAN WHAT IS PUT INTO THEM. </p>
      <p>This, perhaps, is the previously unknown electronic phenomenon
        that the Methernitha group have so zealously been trying to
        protect against unscrupulous entrepreneurs. But I would say that
        this copious supply of free energy is already known to the world
        --- it is not readily available - and its principles are not
        fully understood, as yet, but it is known about. </p>
      <p>As the descriptions say (on the Testatika website), between the
        horseshoe magnet legs are four blocks of transparent
        'plexiglass' type material alternated with copper and aluminium
        plates (that may or may not be perforated), in the sequence
        c-p-a-c-p-a-c-p-a-c-p-a (also see fig.6). And according to the
        Linden Experiment, where Paul Baumann induces a resonance of
        about 80-140 MHz in a coiled horseshoe and then has an
        aluminium-insulator-copper block moved between the horseshoe
        legs, a voltage could be taken off the plates of the block which
        measured 700 volts (DC presumably) [note 13]. This incredible
        phenomenon has never been replicated by any 'outside
        researcher', and is said to be the basis by which the
        Methernitha machine could be understood how to work [the clue,
        possibly, to this Principle Experiment may be
        variable-capacitance and dielectric-absorpsion]. </p>
      <p>But what, I hear you say, is an electron cascade... Well, it
        was only by chance, very recently, that I happened to listen to
        an audio tape by a Dr. Flanagan about crystal water; when I
        switched the tape over after the end of side one Dr. Flanagan
        then began talking about an electronic configuration that
        applied a high frequency, high voltage alternating field across
        an insulator --- that created what he called an electron cascade
        effect --- Yes, I thought, here is the answer to the Methernitha
        Machine. </p>
      <p>The electron cascade or avalanche effect is where air molecules
        are accelerated to the device at such a high velocity that they
        collide with other molecules and atoms in the air to liberate
        new electrons which in turn also collide and liberate even more
        'free electrons' from other air molecules (see fig.5), all of
        which become accelerated by the electric field, and an avalanche
        of electron-multiplications progresses throughout the whole
        immediate environment [note 14]. It's a chain reaction, and an
        entirely safe one, it happens in a more ferocious way in
        lightning strikes, and is a natural phenomenon. And, as in this
        case, the environment actually becomes part of the circuit [note
        15] because the process is actually negatively-ionising the air
        surrounding the Methernitha machines, and that is why those who
        have been near these generators when working say the air around
        about them is cool and fresh [note 16]. </p>
      <p>In view of the fact that it's designers have chosen to wind
        insulated wire (which may or may not be bifilar) around the
        horseshoe metal it is likely that the horseshoes are used for
        some form of induction [note 17], it would also be very possible
        to draw directly from this part of the circuit the extra
        electric current produced from the electron cascade blocks, with
        suitable connections that might lead downward into the wooden
        base (where it is believed that an alternate layering of
        perforated metal plates and insulating plates - making up a
        large high-voltage storage capacitor - is located). This power
        could then be discharged as a pulsed output of high wattage,
        especially if the final output part of the electronic circuit is
        configured as a Pulse Forming Network of multiple sections of
        inductor / capacitor combinations [note 18]. </p>
      <p>The two big cans at the side, the big capacitors, are probably
        not highly technical (see fig.7), once the fundamental formula
        has been decided upon all models of a Testatika generator would
        follow a similar construction process. The written descriptions
        are a little contradictory but they seem to suggest a central
        input rod, or tube, connecting at the bottom of the cans to a
        stack of inter-linked pancake coils, that are wound
        secondary-outside primary-inside, fitted around a core of 6
        hollow donut-ring magnets stacked in such a way with plastic
        spacers as to allow air gaps between them, and then finally the
        output of each can is a connection from the top coil of the
        secondaries of the pancake coils to a brass ring around the
        centre of the black plastic top lid --- and from the photographs
        can be seen a large diameter wire or tube [note 19] connecting
        that polarity's output terminal to the top lid's brass ring via
        a brass screw terminal. I would suggest that the ring magnets
        (of anistropic ferrite perhaps) are gapped in this way to
        prevent the magnetic flux fields of the pancake primaries
        co-joining as one sprawling field, because it would be more
        advantageous, and safer, to have each separate pancake's
        magnetic flux cut it's own adjoining secondary coil, and divide
        the secondary output voltage into smaller amounts of potential,
        thus depending less on complicated insulating procedures that
        accompany high voltage single primary / single secondary
        transformers. </p>
      <p>The use of aluminium mesh and solid copper sheeting is commonly
        used in electronic construction; the outer aluminium mesh
        cylinder would be used to shield stray electrostatic charges,
        and the solid copper cylinder is to shield the large amount of
        stray electromagnetic fields produced by the transforming
        process from high voltage/low current to lower voltage/higher
        current [note 20]. Obviously they don't want field contamination
        taking place between the sensitive electrostatic generator and
        the transformers. </p>
      <p>Within these two outside shielding-cylinders are 'grid
        condensers' which, according to the 1999 report by the 30
        engineers, can be as many as 20 layers of perforated sheet
        (presumably as concentric cylinders) - which I have indicated
        (in fig.7 for instance) as being electrically connected BETWEEN
        each separate secondary winding - in the fashion of an old
        discovery from the early days of wireless telegraphy and based
        on the 'disruptive discharge coil' devised by Nikola Tesla, that
        such a condenser connected in the center of a secondary coil
        collects the maximum amount of voltage created by that
        secondary. This configuration of one condenser inside another
        inside another etc etc, has a striking similarity to the layout
        of a pulse forming network [see note 18]. </p>
      <p>In the red wired can the transformer is wired to output
        negative, and the blue wired can's transformer is wired to
        output positive polarity. Special note should be made of a
        similar arrangement for divided primary / secondary windings
        devised by Van de Graaff in his 'High Voltage Electromagnetic
        Charged-Particle Accelerator Apparatus Having an Insulating
        Magnetic Core' [note 21] with respect to magnetic reluctance
        gaps. </p>
      <p>Whilst it has been said that the clear perspex disc was
        designated the 'cloud' disc, and the (rear) dark disc the
        'ground' disc I would think this relates to different types of
        acrylics or plastics that might become charged to different
        polarities, as in the triboelectric series, where frictional
        charging of different plastics --- and then bringing them close
        together, might cause donation or acceptance from one to the
        other; I would think from the above that cloud represents a
        donator (positive charge) and that ground must mean an acceptor
        (negative charge). Has anyone tried the combination of a teflon
        disc (extremely negative charge) with a glass disc (highly
        positive charge) ? </p>
      <p>Or discs doped with paramagnetic particles perhaps [note 22] ?

      <p><b>Note 4</b> The Methernitha designers have taken a basic
        Pidgeon electric field system and added a few modifications of
        their own, partly to lock a certain polarity of charge to a
        certain area so as to stabilise it, and also to boost certain
        areas with charge. As in their use, for example, of an extra
        field plate located at the top-centre in front of the front disc
        (just under the rectifying valve), note also that this plate, or
        antennae key, is indirectly coupled to the rest of the circuit,
        via a coil setup. Much the same occurs with the two plates
        slightly below it, these plates are connected to a brass
        terminal which connects to a copper wire that goes down and
        winds in a coil shape around a hollow plastic tube, and inside
        the tube will be another wire or small coil that draws off the
        electric charge. So these three plates are using not direct
        connection but induction to get their charge. </p>
      <p><b>Note 5</b> ------- By looking at how each of the
        photographed machines have been constructed you can see that
        these are high quality crafted structures. I would think each
        would start off as sub-assemblies fitted together by pairs or
        small groups of members, those sub-assemblies of wooden base,
        big cans, perspex framework, discs with bearings and axles, when
        completed would be passed on to the electrical engineers of the
        community who would then fit the wiring connections, vacuum tube
        rectifier and make sure that not only did they work but that
        they looked like a work of art. </p>
      <p><b>Note 6</b> --- The Fleming valve had been around since 1905
        and while it progressed to the thermionic valve and audion, by
        1922 the Pearson and Anson Effect was discovered whereby
        oscillating currents could be produced with a resistor,
        capacitor and thermionic valve coupled together. </p>
      <p><b>Note 7</b> --- See US Patent 1,540,998 (9 June 1925)
        Conversion of Atmospheric Electric Energy by Hermann Plauson. He
        also wrote a book of the subject titled "Gewinnung und
        Verwertung der Atmospharischen Elektrizitat" in 1920 in German
        (which is currently held in the British Library). </p>
      <p><b>Note 8</b> --- Whilst some have seen the smaller 300 Watt
        machines discharger/rectifier quite open and not encased in a
        vacuum tube the vacuum tube models would be much more efficient
        and would waste less current. Also, the rectifier tube must have
        a heated filament (which on the 3KW machines can be seen as a
        glowing line running the whole length of the grid and coil
        assembly between the two black end caps, and in the films you
        can see faint flashes coming from behind the rectifier so
        possibly the filament is wrapped around the other side of the
        grid/coil assembly as well). Coolridge, back in the 1900s,
        discovered that no discharge from the cathode to the anode would
        occur, even at 100,000 volts, unless the filament was heated
        (Physics Review, Vol. 2, Dec 1913, p. 418). Aluminium mesh will
        give off electrons quite readily and can be used as a cold
        cathode --- but a heated cathode offers the advantage of being
        able to control the oscillations. </p>
      <p><b>Note 9</b> --- The two long upright tubes are without doubt
        choke coil assemblies in precisely the right place to slow down
        the current where it gets oscillated and rectified. In a choke
        the higher the flow of current the greater will be its
        resistance to that current flow. An even better form of choke
        will have some form of iron core inside it. </p>
      <p><b>Note 10</b> --- I have come up with 6 different circuits for
        this oscillation section, some of which include small quartz
        crystals. (See notes 13 and 16 on frequency of oscillation). The
        black dial at the rear of the 3kw machine is most likely to
        select a variety of capacitances so as to control the
        oscillations of the circuit, which in turn control disc
        rotational speed. </p>
      <p><b>Note 11</b> --- The phenomenon of electrostatic motors has
        been well researched over the years (see "Electrostatic Motors"

        and in "Electrostatics And Its Applications" by A.D. Moore

        "Philips Tech. Review" Vol 30 (1969), p. 178-194). The
        Methernitha Testatika generators (see a recent report by 30
        engineers) auto-rotate, after they have been started by hand, by
        the same principles of these ES motors. </p>
      <p><b>Note 12</b> --- J.G.Trump worked for the US Air Force and
        pioneered some highly efficient electrostatic machines around
        the 1960s (see"Electrostatic Sources of Electric Power" in

      <p><b>Note 13</b> --- Although the Linden Experiment was thought
        to register a frequency of 80-140 MHz this does not necessarily
        mean that the Methernitha generators would oscillate at that
        rate also. Such a frequency seems unnecessarily high. </p>

      </p>
      <p><b>Note 15</b> --- The effect is very similar to the converging
        forces in a non-uniform field, the oscillating perspex blocks
        become one electrode and the surrounding air in the room
        becomes the opposite electrode, and by the processes of
        electrophoresis and dielectrophoresis the electrically charged
        particles in the air (the electrons and negative ions) are drawn
        toward the central electrode, which in this case is the perspex
        block assembly (see "Nonuniform Electric Fields" by Herbert A.
        Pohl in "Scientific American" (Dec 1960) p. 107-8). I am much
        more inclined to believe that the ingenuity of the design of
        these types of machines comes from physicists and not electronic
        engineers. </p>
      <p><b>Note 16</b> --- Dr. Flanagan actually uses the electron
        field generator in his own special ionizer (see Method of
        Purifying Air and Negative Field Generator US Patent 4,391,773).
      </p>
      <p>How does an electron cascade generator work, I would think that
        while you have an alternating electron movement (and Dr.
        Flanagan reckons this effect occurs with a high voltage field
        alternating at above 20 KHz) at the metal electrodes, the
        perspex blocks sandwiched between them would transfer the
        electricity not through their mass but around it, as surface
        charge --- actually in the layer of air right next to the
        insulators surface. Its the same principle as dielectric
        absorption - the perspex blocks don't discharge themselves fast
        enough to keep up with the alternating voltage and so they
        accumulate more and more charge --- until it forms as a layer of
        charge on the insulator's surface. This means that at a high
        enough frequency the surface-air molecules polarize, with the
        more mobile electrons separating from the slower bulks of those
        molecules and while the electrons get thrusted back and forth a
        secondary layer of (slower) positive air ions develops, and so
        on, and the process of high voltage high frequency polarization
        triggers the electron avalanche effect. </p>
      <p>In the event that the perspex blocks are indeed ELECTRETS (as
        free-energy researcher Geoff Egel and others suggest) I would
        think that they would work in a similar fashion to the above
        process, of dielectric absorption that charges up the blocks
        before they produce the cascade-effect. Because in the electret
        the electrons charged into the perspex/plastic, and the positive
        ions, would still be manipulated by the reversing
        electromagnetic field in such a way as to orientate (as with
        dipoles) back and forth, to eventually reach the point (if the
        whole circuit is tuned properly) where they would attain
        resonance with the immediate air surrounding them. And if this
        effect is similar to an inductance then possibly a back-emf will
        result also, to increase the output voltage. Either way I
        believe the effect will still be an electron cascade through the
        environment and the product of this oscillating output (at the
        blocks) could similarly be drawn off and accumulated in the
        multi-layered base capacitor network. </p>
      <p>I would suggest that a test program to find the best type of
        blocks would be; One --- try different types of
        plastic/acrylic/ceramic materials for the blocks. <br>
        Two --- try different methods of electrifying the plastics (as
        with electrets). Three --- try plastics doped with
        semiconducting particles. Four - try plastics doped with
        paramagnetic particles. Five - try hollow plastic blocks
        containing an electrolytic fluid. More information on plastics
        will be found on the Electret vs Dielectric Absorption Page. </p>
      <p><b>Note 17</b> --- There are several definitions of Bifilar,
        one where the wires cancel out their magnetic fields, and one
        where the wires are wound to ensure a tight low-loss magnetic
        flux coupling, in this case you need all the magnetic flux you
        can get so it must be the latter --- See "Transformers For
        Electronic Circuits" by Nathan R. Grossner (1967), p. 224 etc. </p>
      <p>Most commonly used magnetic metal is Mumetal, which is an
        easily saturable magnetic material, routing magnetic flux
        through it rather than in the surrounding air, so as to enhance
        the mutual induction between the two coilings of red wire around
        the horseshoe legs. </p>
      <p><b>Note 18</b> --- So that the machine's output voltage doesn't
        drain away when it is connected up to a large load, what is
        needed here is a Pulse Forming Network (or artificial delay
        line). "Such a network is an improvement on simple capacitor
        storage because of the cascading action from one capacitor to
        the next along the chain. At the beginning, all capacitors are
        charged to the same voltage but as soon as the first one starts
        to loose voltage, the one behind it is then free to discharge
        into it. This topping-up action, which trickles down the network
        from capacitor to capacitor, is the mechanism by which the
        voltage across the output terminals tends to hold onto its
        original level." (see "High Energy Discharge Systems"
        A.P.Stephenson,&nbsp; Electronics Today International, March
        1992, pp. 24-26). </p>
      <p><b>Note 19</b> --- When voltage of a high potential and high
        frequency flows along a wire it does so on the outer surface
        (called the skin effect) and so the Methernitha would use
        thick wiring or even 1/8" tubing to connect its circuit. </p>

        (1935), p. 218 &amp; p. 341. </p>
      <p><b>Note 21</b> --- For information on maximum voltage in the
        center of a secondary coil see "A Handbook of Wireless
        Telegraphy" by J. Erskine-Murray (1913) p. 42; and an article

        1967) and 3,187,208 (June 1, 1965). These patents were not just
        for a Van de Graaff high voltage generator, they were for a
        special system devised by Van de Graaff long after his generator
        had been in use to convert static electricity into current
        electricity. This system may be a little too complicated for the
        Methernitha but, nevertheless, the principles he used for
        multiple primary / secondary windings may be of some interest. </p>
      <p><b>Note 22</b> --- Dr. Flanagan modified his insulator blocks,
        made of resin, by doping them with paramagnetic granules (such
        as silicon carbide) to enhance even more the electron cascade
        effect; which is an idea that the physicist Thomas Townsend
        Brown first experimented with (by using lead oxide granules) in
        his US Patent 3,187,206 (June 1, 1965) to good effect. The
        surrounding air could also be enhanced in similar fashion to
        polarise it's electric charge and improve its side of the
        performance (for those interested in the physics of this see

      <p>With respect to the 30 engineer's report (of 1999) the
        'principle experiment' was set up in such a way (see diag 1)
        that by swivelling the cross-piece over two other plexiglas
        blocks a current was transferred into two capacitors. Possibly
        when someone grabs hold of the swivelling cross-piece they
        transfer some static electricity from their body to the grilles
        of the cross-piece which, when vigorously turned back and forth
        will initiate a transfer of electric charge to the two stacks of
        blocks below them attached to the base. This may either be
        because anyone walking over a carpet or wearing man-made fibres
        will already hold thousands of volts of electrostatic charge -
        which will be enough to 'prime' this apparatus after touching
        it, to get it to work, much the same as when a rotating
        influence machine has to be primed with an electric charge
        before it will work; or, as many researchers have surmised
        already, that the plexiglas blocks glued to the swivelling
        cross-piece had been charged up with electricity as an ELECTRET.
      </p>
      <p>The use of mesh around the cross-piece guarantees a variable
        capacitance to the moving arms --- and as these are moved
        quickly over the base blocks (again, alternated with mesh and
        Plexiglas) an amount of electric charge will be transferred to
        them EACH TIME the arms go backward-and-forward over them.
        Electronically, you have one variable capacitance acting upon
        another variable capacitance - which is why Baumann said that if
        metal foil were used instead of the mesh it would not produce
        the same effect. </p>
      <p>What happens next is called "dielectric absorption", and the
        following extract, from "Dielectrics" by P.J.Harrop (1972) pp71,
        will explain; </p>
      <p>"When a given dielectric [i.e., plexiglas] has a field put
        across it, and this field is then removed, the electrodes are
        briefly shorted out (not enough for all the ions and particles
        to relapse back) and the device left on open circuit one finds
        subsequently that it has partially charged up again. </p>
      <p>This is due to the slow-moving charge carriers remaining in
        position. It can be a frightening phenomenon with practical
        dielectrics since a person who has briefly discharged a charged
        insulator may subsequently touch it and be severely shocked."
        Some dielectric materials being more prone to this effect than
        others, and so obviously some experimentation will be needed to
        choose the best perspex, plexiglas, plastic, or acrylic
        materials so as to take the most advantage from this dielectric
        absorption effect. </p>
      <p>Once the blocks are being charged up the electric charge simply
        flows into the two interconnected capacitors and accumulates. </p>

      <p><b>Linden Experiment ~</b> </p>
      <p>A look at the only available diagram of the Linden experiment
        (see diag 2) shows a horseshoe magnet coupled to what seems to
        be a closed-ended wire. It can also be seen in this diagram that
        the wire coils around the magnet are sufficiently spaced apart
        so as to provide capacitance (between each coil of the wire) in
        the circuit. So, with capacitance, coils (for induction), and
        magnetic flux, you have all the ingredients needed to make an
        oscillating circuit --- provided there is a supply of voltage
        and some sort of interruption mechanism - then you have a
        circuit that will resonate. And this leads us back to that oft
        repeated question --- is the block used in the Linden Experiment
        an electret. The first person to PUBLISH how they have
        duplicated this experiment will be the one to answer that
        question... </p>
      <p>But there is something wrong with this diagram --- the resonant
        frequency of this simple circuit --- depending only on the
        values of inductance and capacitance included in the circuit
        would consequently enable it to oscillate at only a few
        kilohertz at best. No circuit of capacitance/inductance can be
        made to resonate at such a high frequency as claimed, not even
        if it included any form of quartz crystal. If, as the diagram
        says, it resonates at 140 MHz then there must be a Lecher wire
        system (the running of two conducting wires in a parallel line,
        about a foot apart or less, for several feet) to make it
        resonate at such a high frequency. It would seem to me also that
        a required modification of the Linden Experiment diagram would
        be to put a different metal into this circuit where the wire is
        said to be "closed-ended", say for instance a zinc plate, then
        there will be a contact voltage established between the copper
        wire and the zinc plate. Such a voltage would start the circuit
        resonating, for the reasons stated above. </p>
      <p>And as with the Tini setup if a block comprising two metal
        plates separated by a suitable dielectric material (such as
        plexiglas) is placed in an oscillating electric field the
        electric charge on the metal plates will permeate into the
        dielectric, and for the same reasons as detailed above in the
        Principle Experiment, will temporarily accumulate voltage
        because of dielectric absorption. As I have already said
        elsewhere there is a great similarity between the phenomenon of
        the Testatika horseshoe blocks (and the Tini setup) and the
        principle behind Patrick Flanagan's Electron Field Generator
        which energizes an electron cascade mechanism throughout the
        immediate environment. </p>

      <p>The first really running "free energy" machine coming from
        Switzerland, Europe. It was developed over a 20 years Research
        period by a religious group called: METHERNITHA. This group
        lives in CH-3517 Linden, Switzerland. The inventor of this
        superb machine, Mr.Paul Baumann claims, its running principle
        was found by studying the lightning effects from nature. </p>
      <p>And here are the facts : </p>
      <p>* Testatika is an influence-type Wimhurst machine which runs on
        it's own energy, once started by counterclock revolving it's 2
        dics by hand !!! </p>
      <p>* Testatika not only runs on it' own energy, but produces also
        a huge amount of excess power, at least 3 KWATTS of power! That
        is enough to supply a one-person apartment with one machine! </p>
      <p>* The machine you see during this demo-animation is only about
        70 cm wide, 40 cm deep and about 60 cm tall ! </p>
      <p>* It delivers DC-Voltage ranging from 270 til 320 Volts, only
        depending on the dryness of the air! At this voltage it can
        supply at least 10 Amperes of DC-current ! </p>
      <p>* Testatika is not a perpetuum mobile, but an energy machine
        that collects it's huge amount of "FREE" energy from the charged
        and ionized air particles. But there are still some
        technological tricks implemented to overcome the normal
        drag-resistance of a conventional Wimhurst machine, which is
        still the secret of the Methernitha group !!! </p>
      <p>When will this technology be available for everyone? </p>
      <p>The Testatika machines, (there already exists also some smaller
        units which only deliver about 200-300 Watts) are not yet
        mass-production type models! They are still laboratory prototype
        units, although they are build with a very good craftmansship !

        Methernitha sells. It shows the machines (also the smaler ones)
        and explains also Methernitha's spiritual aims. The tape has a
        running length of about 40 minutes and is really worth looking
        at it! It is also available in <br>
        VHS-NTSC and American language. It also shows Methernitha's
        earlier research developments like huge wind generators. </p>
      <p>With the Testatika there is no fraud, hidden batteries or any

        for centuries. Now it has come true! </p>

      <p>Having read Nelson Camus article purporting to "explain" the
        Testatika over-unity generator
        (http://members.aol.com/overunity2/nelson/testatic.htm), I am of
        the opinion that the real explanation is hidden amongst the 19th
        century electrical mumbo jumbo which makes up much of the
        machine (Leyden Jars, Horseshoe Magnets, Wimshurst Generator and
        so on). From the description of spiral-wound foil capacitors
        containing radioactive material and placed within current
        carrying coils it strikes me that perhaps the real energy comes
        from Beta particles (fast electrons) absorbed into the
        electrical circuit. </p>
      <p>To extract energy from Beta particles it is not just enough to
        capture them. Clearly this will result in a current flow
        according to the capture rate, but current by itself is not
        power. The kinetic energy of the particle must be captured and
        this will result in potential difference or voltage. If a Beta
        particle enters a thin foil conductor normal to its surface and
        is captured, then the potential difference associated with
        giving up its kinetic energy can be expected to occur across the
        opposite faces of the foil. If however the Beta particle were
        turned so as to enter at a shallow grazing angle to the surface,
        not only would the probability of capture be increased (since
        the particle will travel further within the material) but the
        potential difference will occur along the length of the foil.
        Beta particles travelling even at relavistic velocities can be
        turned within short distances by relatively weak magnetic
        fields, so the concept shown in the following Figure suggests
        itself. </p>

        <p><b><font size="+1">"The Research Work of Methernitha in the
              Field of the so-called Free Energy"</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p><br>
      </p>
      <p>Ever since the foundation of Methernitha there existed a
        department for research, development and electronics, which was
        concerned with the problem of alternative energy sources, namely
        with technologies, which were suited to exploit the inherent
        forces of nature and thus to unlock sources of energy&nbsp;
        without disturbing natures ecological balance in any negative
        way. Any technology man invents should serve him in short as
        well as in long terms, and this condition is not fulfilled as
        soon as it opposes nature in any way. </p>
      <p>This team of research within Methernitha works completely&nbsp;
        autonomous and is financed out of the co-operatives own
        resources,&nbsp; without any outside support. </p>
      <p>The efficient utilisation of wind energy was one of the first
        objectives of Methernitha's research program. At the beginning
        generators with special excitation were developed, which allowed
        to load the cells of accumulators even at low RPM at times when
        there are only moderate air movements. </p>
      <p>Utilising the kinetic energy of water currents was another
        field of interest of the development team,&nbsp; but it was
        pursued more as hobby. The key problem was here to transfer the
        slow revolutions of the waterwheel to an extent that the
        excitation threshold of the generator could be surpassed by a
        minimal loss of energy. </p>
      <p>Also solar cells and solar heat collectors attracted the
        attention of our researchers since a long time. But since in
        these fields other institutions have attained outstanding
        results, Methernitha started, and this was already more than 30
        years ago, to concentrate its efforts on lesser known and even
        generally unknown sources of energy. The result of this
        scientific work is the Thestatica machine. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;The question arises: How it comes, that Methernitha,
        nothing more than a private organisation, could invest so much
        time, engagement, perseverance and&nbsp; financial resources in
        this kind of research. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;Research and development are integrated parts of the
        general idealistic concept of Methernitha. To make you
        understand these ideals and goals, we will now introduce you
        into the practical sides of this spiritual community
        Methernitha, as it&nbsp; functions as a co-operative of people,
        living and working together. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;Linden is a calm village of farmers just as dozens of
        others in the region of the valley called Emmental. However
        Linden is also the home of a special form of human life, which
        is capable of attracting more and more people from all over the
        globe, and which has repeatedly caused astonishment through its
        excellent functioning, even in extremely difficult situations. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;There is no doubt that the formation of Methernitha is
        also a good part of the life story of Paul Baumann. Through his
        extraordinary technical capabilities, but also through his
        astonishing practicable wisdom he opened relations to all kind
        of people with ideals and in many places, and pretty soon, the
        idea to form a co-operative enterprise took shape. </p>
      <p>"In the name of the God Almighty" people of equal thinking
        gathered and founded a co-operative, which could serve as the
        economic basis of this spiritual community. </p>
      <p>"We want to be a united group of brothers, and never separate
        however severe the burden may be", this was the solemn vow. </p>
      <p>Renunciation of alcohol and smoking and the will to realise a
        harmonious community life without dispute and discord like in
        the original Christian communities were the prerequisites to
        become a member. For the members Methernitha is an ideal
        opportunity to lead a fulfilled life by practising charity. </p>
      <p>A workshop was erected and soon, one house after the other grew
        on these premises. Also all construction was done out of own
        resources and solely with the savings from the common work. </p>
      <p>Today Methernitha is a social model proving the quality of its
        ideals through its well functioning just more than forty years.
        The people working here are almost without exception members of
        Methernitha. </p>
      <p>Not even the prospering development that took place over the
        following decades could impair or even suppress the global
        idealistic aims. On the contrary, everybody works in his own
        interest with diligence and great joy towards the erection and
        the support of their new&nbsp; homeland and according to the
        principle: </p>
      <p>One for all and all for one! </p>
      <p>With this word one can conquer anything. Also the ancient
        truths appear again and attain respect. </p>
      <p>The people living here feel themselves as members of a family,
        like a group sitting in the same boat and proud, but also
        grateful proprietors of their own beautiful homeland, which they
        may shape exactly as they wish to. Evidently, this form of human
        social life can function only on the base of idealistic
        principles. </p>
      <p>The question arises, how the realisation of a sincere religious
        philosophy of life may be brought in harmony with a successful
        economic management. It is not obvious at all, that this is
        attainable. </p>
      <p>Nowadays there are many amongst us that are caught in the
        world-wide and dense network of social and economic dependencies
        and obligations and many also feel the confrontation with its
        problems. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;One member of the economic directory has recently phrased
        this in the following way: </p>
      <p>"The fact that all essential functions of Methernitha are
        fulfilled without any external force, driven solely through
        inner conviction, which causes everybody to help and take care
        of the other, this is for me the most astonishing effect which
        is produced by this form of living together. It seems to be a
        miracle." </p>
      <p>&nbsp;Another miracle within Methernitha is the Thestatica,
        which is the result of more than 20 years of research. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;This wonder machine is lurked from nature, nothing else.
        Nature is the greatest source of power as well as knowledge
        which man has, and it still conceals many secrets, which are
        only revealed to those, who approach and tie in with them with
        highest&nbsp; respect and responsibility. </p>
      <p>To understand nature and to perceive its voice, man is obliged
        to experience silence and solitude, and it was there, where the
        knowledge about this technology was obtained. </p>
      <p>For these reasons it was always a great concern of Methernitha
        to acquire properties, untouched by man as far as possible, be
        it in valleys or forests, in the mountains or ashore of lakes,
        where one could study nature, ones own being and the creator of
        all this universe in silence and concentration and without being
        disturbed. </p>
      <p>The public never understood this properly, rather interpreted
        it wrongly as an act of seclusion, assuming we had to hide
        something unclean. We actually had --- and still have --- to
        take great troubles to realise undisturbed all the things we
        intended to accomplish. </p>
      <p>Such undertaking in research and development necessitate
        considerable financial expenditures. Therefore we are quite
        often obliged to construct things with most primitive means and
        materials. What was thrown away by our affluent society, we
        collect and possibly set up with it a cornerstone in the
        discovery of new forces and truth. </p>
      <p>We are fortunate in gaining the experience that paradoxically
        the most beautiful and useful results can be achieved by just
        using the most simple means. Never did we use any borrowed
        capital because we want to stay free Swiss citizens and do not
        want to be hindered or even bound in any way in the pursuance of
        our aims. </p>
      <p>The two conterrotating discs generate an electrostatic charge.
        One disc represents the earth, the other the cloud. Using grid
        electrodes the charges are bound. After that they are collected
        by non-contacting so-called antenna keys and then sorted. </p>
      <p>After being initially turned on by hand, the discs rotate by
        themselves according to the electrostatic laws about attraction
        and repulsion. A rectifying diode keeps the cycles in steady
        state. Otherwise the impulses of attraction and repulsion would
        accumulate and cause the discs to run faster and faster. The
        correct speed is of great importance and for optimal power
        generation the discs have to run quite steady and slow. </p>
      <p>By means of grid condensers the energy is stored and then
        uniformly discharged, at the same time reducing the high voltage
        and building up power with additional devices. Finally the
        machine supplies a uniform direct current, which varies
        according to the size of the model. The machine furnishes about
        3-4kW permanent output, depending on humidity, whereby the
        electric potential ranges from 270 to 320Volt. High humidity of
        the atmosphere prevents the build-up of electric potential. The
        drier the air, the better. </p>
      <p>No doubt, through the so far achieved results one main
        objective has been reached, namely to prove that it is possible
        to use Free Energy. Nevertheless the research work is not yet
        completed. </p>
      <p>To the educated physicist many a thing of this machine may seem
        impossible, maybe even crazy. Maybe he is also offended by the
        conceptions used to explain the whole. Only partly we could use
        the concepts of conventional physical terminology to explain and
        define only approximately the functions and properties of the
        various parts of the machine. </p>
      <p>After all it will be necessary to create some more new concepts
        like the one we have already used before, when we termed the
        non-contacting collectors of electric charges as antenna keys. </p>
      <p>This machine puts experts, which are just trained in
        conventional physics to a very hard test, because its mode of
        action is not explainable with the state of the art of
        officially accepted physical knowledge, or at the most only
        partially explainable. However also a trained specialist should
        remain free and independent in his thinking, and should avoid to
        be limited by the temporal framework of publicly admitted
        knowledge in any science. </p>
      <p>It has to be remembered that the established science was
        already many times forced to change or give up some of its very
        fundamental concepts. Think about Galilee, to name only one
        example. Our human society almost condemned this man as a
        sorcerer and magician, just because he investigated and
        discovered a truth that seemed unacceptable by the established
        science of the days. </p>
      <p>The book knowledge of any times is not wrong, but it is
        incomplete, and therefore allows to draw wrong conclusions. </p>
      <p>We are part of a new area which brings to light many new facts
        and new knowledge. The clothes of nowadays science have become
        too tight and should be stripped off, just as the larva of an
        insect does with its skin. Only this will allow a true
        metamorphosis to take its course, and finally, at the limits and
        at the destination of all worldly knowledge, an universal and
        unlimited spiritual science, radiating and beautiful, just as
        the completed imago of an insect, may give its blessings and
        benediction to a renovated humanity. </p>
      <p>To ever reach there, a universal development of man has to take
        place. This however is only possible when man becomes aware of
        his true role within the whole creation, and again learns to
        recognise his true tasks, because the whole universe functions
        within a strict and precisely structured order according to the
        will and word of the creator. Therefore also man should
        recognise and realise these universal laws that are valid within
        the whole and within every part of this creation. </p>
      <p>The hard facts rather show how far man has left the divine
        order through his self willed and authoritarian way of action
        and that he has become the actual cause of all discord and evil
        on this planet. </p>
      <p>Unfortunately the ruling bodies that should be responsible for
        the well-being of the people work too often with the target to
        make life more and more difficult and to render impossible every
        free spiritual development. </p>
      <p>Instead of utilising the achievements of science and technology
        for the benefit and preservation of all form of life, they are
        abused carelessly and irresponsibly&nbsp; to destroy and to
        kill, and thus turn them into a curse upon mankind. </p>
      <p>To change all this, the evolution of a new technology is not
        enough, even if it were the most ecological and ingenious. To
        change this present status one has to go much deeper down, to
        the root-cause of all this evil, and this is mans way of
        thinking, his state of mind. </p>
      <p>The ancient divine commandments are still valid today and also
        show today the way and direction humanity should go, as clearly
        spoken by the prophet Mica: </p>
      <p>God has told you what is good. And what is it that the Lord
        asks of you? Only to act justly, to love loyalty, to walk wisely
        before your God. </p>

        <p>(Transcribed from the Methernitha Testatika video by Paul E
          Potter)</p>

      <p>"... The efficient utilization of wind energy was one of the
        first objectives of Methernithas research program. </p>
      <p>At the beginning generators with special excitation were
        developed which allowed to load the cells of accumulators even
        at low rpm, at times when there are only moderate movements. </p>
      <p>Utilizing the kinetic energy of water currents was another
        field of interest of the development team, but it was pursued
        more as hobby. The key problem was here to transfer the slow
        revolutions of the water-wheel to an extent that the excitation
        threshold of the generator could be surpassed by a minimal loss
        of energy. Also solar cells and solar heat collectors attracted
        the attention of our researchers since a long time. But since in
        these fields other institutions have obtained outstanding
        results Methernitha started, and this was already more than 20
        years ago [since 1960], to concentrate its efforts on
        lesser-known and even generally unknown sources of energy, the
        result of this scientific work is the Testatika machine of which
        most of you may have heard already. </p>
      <p>The two counter-rotating discs generate an electrostatic
        charge. One disc represents the earth, the other the cloud.
        Using grid-electrodes* the charges are bound. After that they
        are collected by non-contacted, so-called, antennae keys** and
        then sorted [shorted ?]. </p>
      <p>After being initially turned on by hand the discs rotate by
        themselves according to the electrostatic laws about attraction
        and repulsion. </p>
      <p>A rectifying-diode keeps the cycles in steady state, otherwise
        the impulses of attraction and repulsion would accumulate and
        cause the disc to run faster and faster. The correct speed is of
        great importance, and for optimum power generation the discs
        have to run quite steady and slow. </p>
      <p>By means of grid-condensers* the energy is stored and it is
        then uniformly discharged, at the same time reducing the
        high-voltage and building up power with additional devices. </p>
      <p>Finally, the machine supplies a uniform direct current which
        varies according to size of the model. </p>
      <p>The machine furnishes about 3 to 4 Kilo-Watt permanent output,
        depending on humidity, whereby the electrical potential ranges
        from 270 to 320 volt. High humidity of the atmosphere prevents
        the build up of electric potential. The dryer the air the
        better. </p>
      <p>No doubt, through the so-far achieved results, one main
        objective has been reached, namely, to prove that it is possible
        to use free energy. Nevertheless, the research work is not yet
        completed: To finish a model which can be handed out more or
        less to anybody and without any haphazards, also to
        non-specialists, much work and also time will still be needed. </p>
      <p>Only partly we could use the concepts of conventional physical
        terminology in order to explain and define only approximately
        the functions and properties of the various parts of the
        machine. After all, it will be necessary to create some more new
        concepts, like the one we have already used before, when we
        termed the non-contacting collectors of electric charge as
        antennae keys**. This machine puts experts who are just trained
        in conventional physics to a very hard test..." </p>
      <p>* The German original has gitter-condensers, with gitter
        defined as wire lattice, grille, grate. </p>
      <p>** the original word used is tasten or taster, which means
        antenna, probe, key. </p>
