          <b>System &amp; Apparatus for Applying an Electric Field to a
            Combustion Volume</b></big><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      According to an embodiment, combustion in a combustion volume is
      affected by at least two sequentially applied non-parallel
      electric fields. According to an embodiment, a combustion volume
      is equipped with at least three individually modulatable
      electrodes. According to an embodiment, an electric field
      application apparatus for a combustion volume includes a safety
      apparatus to reduce or eliminate danger.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND</b><br>
      <br>
      [0001] A time-varying electric field may be applied to a flame.
      The flame may respond by modifying its behavior, such as by
      increasing its rate of heat evolution.<br>
      <br>
      <b>OVERVIEW</b><br>
      <br>
      [0002] According to an embodiment, a system may provide a
      plurality of electric field axes configured to pass near or
      through a flame.<br>
      <br>
      [0003] According to an embodiment, a plurality greater than two
      electrodes may selectively produce a plurality greater than two
      electric field axes through or near a flame. According to an
      embodiment, at least one of the selectable electric field axes may
      be not parallel or antiparallel with at least one other of the
      selectable electric field axes.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] According to an embodiment, a controller may sequentially
      select an electric field configuration in a combustion volume. A
      plurality greater than two electrode drivers may drive the
      sequential electric field configurations in the combustion volume.
      According to an embodiment, the controller may drive the
      sequential electric field configurations at a periodic rate.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] According to an embodiment, a plurality of electric field
      modulation states may be produced sequentially at a periodic
      frequency equal to or greater than about 120 Hz. According to an
      embodiment, a plurality of electric field modulation states may be
      produced sequentially at a frequency of change equal to or greater
      than about 1 KHz.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] According to an embodiment, a modulation frequency of
      electric field states in a combustion volume may be varied as a
      function of a fuel delivery rate, an airflow rate, a desired
      energy output rate, or other desired operational parameter.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] According to an embodiment, an algorithm may be used to
      determine one or more characteristics of one or more sequences of
      electric field modulation states. The algorithm may be a function
      of input variables and/or detected variables. The input variables
      may include a fuel delivery rate, an airflow rate, a desired
      energy output rate, and/or another operational parameter.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] According to an embodiment, an electric field controller
      may include a fuzzy logic circuit configured to determine a
      sequence of electric field modulation states in a combustion
      volume as a function of input variables and/or detected variables.
      The input variables may include a fuel delivery rate, an airflow
      rate, a desired energy output rate, and/or another operational
      parameter.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] According to embodiments, related systems include but are
      not limited to circuitry and/or programming for providing method
      embodiments. Combinations of hardware, software, and/or firmware
      may be configured according to the preferences of the system
      designer.<br>

      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0019] In the following detailed description, reference is made to
      the accompanying drawings, which form a part hereof. In the
      drawings, similar symbols typically identify similar components,
      unless context dictates otherwise. Other embodiments may be used
      and/or and other changes may be made without departing from the
      spirit or scope of the disclosure. In the following detailed
      description, reference is made to the accompanying drawings, which
      form a part hereof. In the drawings, similar symbols typically
      identify similar components, unless context dictates otherwise.
      The illustrative embodiments described in the detailed
      description, drawings, and claims are not meant to be limiting.
      Other embodiments may be utilized, and other changes may be made,
      without departing from the spirit or scope of the subject matter
      presented herein.<br>
      <br>
      [0020] FIG. 1 is a diagram of a combustion volume 103 with a
      system 101 configured for application of a time-varying electric
      field to the combustion volume 103, according to an embodiment. A
      burner nozzle 102 is configured to support a flame 104 in a
      combustion volume 103. For example, the combustion volume 103 may
      form a portion of a boiler, a water tube boiler, a fire tube
      boiler, a hot water tank, a furnace, an oven, a flue, an exhaust
      pipe, a cook top, or the like.<br>
      <br>
      [0021] At least three electrodes 106, 108, and 110 are arranged
      near or in the combustion volume 103 such that application of a
      voltage signals to the electrodes may form an electric field
      across the combustion volume 103 in the vicinity of or through the
      flame 104 supported therein by the burner nozzle 102. The
      electrodes 106, 108, and 110 may be respectively energized by
      corresponding leads 112, 114, and 116, which may receive voltage
      signals from a controller and/or amplifier (not shown).<br>
      <br>
      [0022] While the burner nozzle 102 is shown as a simplified hollow
      cylinder, several alternative embodiments may be contemplated.
      While the burner 102 and the electrodes 106, 108, and 110 are
      shown in respective forms and geometric relationships, other
      geometric relationships and forms may be contemplated. For
      example, the electrodes 106, 108, 110 may have shapes other than
      cylindrical. According to some embodiments, the burner nozzle 102
      may be energized to form one of the electrodes. According to some
      embodiments, a plurality of nozzles may support a plurality of
      flames in the combustion volume 103.<br>
      <br>
      [0023] According to an embodiment a first plurality of electrodes
      106, 108, 110 may support a second plurality of electric field
      axes across the combustion volume 103 in the vicinity of or
      through at least one flame. According to the example 101, one
      electric field axis may be formed between electrodes 106 and 108.
      Another electric field axis may be formed between electrodes 108
      and 110. Another electric field axis may be formed between
      electrodes 106 and 110.<br>
      <br>
      [0024] The illustrative embodiment of FIG. 1 may vary considerably
      in scale, according to the applications. For example, in a
      relatively small system the inner diameter of the burner 102 may
      be about a centimeter, and the distance between electrodes 106,
      108, 110 may be about 1.5 centimeters. In a somewhat larger
      system, for example, the inner diameter of the burner 102 may be
      about 1.75 inches and the distance between the electrodes may be
      about 3.25 inches. Other dimensions and ratios between burner size
      and electrode spacing are contemplated.<br>
      <br>
      [0025] According to embodiments, an algorithm may provide a
      sequence of voltages to the electrodes 106, 108, 110. The
      algorithm may provide a substantially constant sequence of
      electric field states or may provide a variable sequence of
      electric field states, use a variable set of available electrodes,
      etc. While a range of algorithms are contemplated for providing a
      range of sequences of electric field states, a simple algorithm
      for the three illustrative electrodes 106, 108, 110 is shown in
      FIGS. 2A-2C.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] FIG. 2A is a depiction 202 of a nominal electric field 204
      formed at least momentarily at a first time from electrode 106 to
      electrode 108, according to an embodiment. If the electric field
      204 is depicted such that electrode 106 is held at a positive
      potential and electrode 108 is held at a negative potential, then
      electrons and other negatively charges species in the combustion
      volume 103 tend to stream away from electrode 108 and toward
      electrode 106. Similarly, positive ions and other positively
      charged species in the combustion volume 103 tend to stream away
      from electrode 106 and toward electrode 108.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] A flame 104 in the combustion volume 103 may include a
      variety of charged and uncharged species. For example, charged
      species that may respond to an electric field may include
      electrons, protons, negatively charged ions, positively charged
      ions, negatively charged particulates, positively charged
      particulates, negatively charged fuel vapor, positively charged
      fuel vapor, negatively charged combustion products, and positively
      charged combustion products, etc. Such charged species may be
      present at various points and at various times in a combustion
      process. Additionally, a combustion volume 103 and/or flame may
      include uncharged combustion products, unburned fuel, and air. The
      charged species typically present in flames generally make flames
      highly conductive. Areas of the combustion volume 103 outside the
      flame 104 may be relatively non-conductive. Hence, in the presence
      of a flame 104, the nominal electric field 204 may be expressed as
      drawing negatively charged species within the flame 104 toward the
      volume of the flame proximate electrode 106, and as drawing
      positive species within the flame 104 toward the volume of the
      flame 104 proximate electrode 108.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] Ignoring other effects, drawing positive species toward the
      portion of the flame 104 proximate electrode 108 may tend to
      increase the mass density of the flame 104 near electrode 108. It
      is also known that applying an electric field to a flame may
      increase the rate and completeness of combustion.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] FIG. 2B is a depiction 206 of a nominal electric field 208
      formed at least momentarily at a second time from electrode 108 to
      electrode 110, according to an embodiment. If the electric field
      208 is depicted such that electrode 108 is held at a positive
      potential and electrode 110 is held at a negative potential, then
      negatively charged species in the combustion volume 103 tend to
      stream away from electrode 110 and toward electrode 108; and
      positive species in the combustion volume 103 tend to stream away
      from electrode 108 and toward electrode 110.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] Similarly to the description of FIG. 2A, positive species
      in the flame 104 in the combustion volume 103 may be drawn toward
      the volume of the flame proximate electrode 110 and negatively
      charged species within the flame 204 may be drawn toward the
      volume of the flame proximate electrode 108. This may tend to
      increase the mass density of the flame 104 near electrodes 108
      and/or 110.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] If the electric field configuration 206 of FIG. 2B is
      applied shortly after application of the electric field
      configuration 202 of FIG. 2A, a movement of higher mass density of
      positively charged species from the region of the flame 104
      proximate electrode 108 to the region of the flame proximate
      electrode 110, may tend to cause a clockwise rotation of at least
      the positively charged species within the flame 104, along with an
      acceleration of combustion. If the relative abundance, relative
      mass, and/or relative drift velocity of positive species are
      greater than that of negative species, then application of the
      electric field configurations 202 and 206 in relatively quick
      succession may tend to cause a net rotation or swirl of the flame
      104 in a clockwise direction. Alternatively, if the relative
      abundance, relative mass, and/or relative drift velocity of
      negative species are greater than that of positive species, then
      application of the electric field configurations 202 and 206 in
      relatively quick succession may tend to cause a net rotation or
      swirl of the flam 104 in a counter-clockwise direction.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] FIG. 2C is a depiction 210 of an electric field 212 formed
      at least momentarily at a third time from electrode 110 to
      electrode 106, according to an embodiment. If the electric field
      212 is depicted such that electrode 110 is held at a positive
      potential and electrode 106 is held at a negative potential, then
      negatively charged species in the combustion volume 103 tend to
      stream away from electrode 110 and toward electrode 108; and
      positive species in the combustion volume 103 tend to stream away
      from electrode 108 and toward electrode 110.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] Similarly to the description of FIG. 2A, positive species
      in the flame 104 in the combustion volume 103 may be drawn toward
      the volume of the flame proximate electrode 106 and negatively
      charged species within the flame 204 may be drawn toward the
      volume of the flame proximate electrode 110. This may tend to
      increase the mass density of the flame 104 near electrode 106
      and/or electrode 110, depending on the relative abundance, mass,
      and drift velocity of positively and negatively charged species.
      If the electric field configuration 210 of FIG. 2C is applied
      shortly after application of the electric field configuration 206
      of FIG. 2B, a movement of higher mass density from the region of
      the flame 104 proximate electrode 110 to the region of the flame
      proximate electrode 106 may tend to cause a clockwise rotation of
      positive species and counter-clockwise rotation of negative
      species in the flame 104, along with an acceleration of
      combustion. Depending on the relative mass, relative abundance,
      and relative drift velocities of the positive and negative
      species, this may tend to cause a clockwise or counter-clockwise
      swirl.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] According to an embodiment, for example when a
      field-reactive movement of species is dominated by positively
      charged species, a sequential, repeating application of nominal
      electric fields 204, 208, 212 may tend to accelerate the flame 104
      to produce a clockwise swirl or vortex effect in the flame. Such a
      sequential electric field application may further tend to expose
      reactants to a streaming flow of complementary reactants and
      increase the probability of collisions between reactants to reduce
      diffusion-limitations to reaction kinetics. Decreased diffusion
      limitation may tend to increase the rate of reaction, further
      increasing exothermic output, thus further increasing the rate of
      reaction. The higher temperature and higher reaction rate may tend
      to drive the flame reaction farther to completion to increase the
      relative proportion of carbon dioxide (CO2) to other partial
      reaction products such as carbon monoxide (CO), unburned fuel,
      etc. exiting the combustion volume 103. The greater final extent
      of reaction may thus provide higher thermal output and/or reduce
      fuel consumption for a given thermal output.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] According to another embodiment, the sequential repeating
      application of nominal electric fields 204, 208, 212 may tend to
      accelerate the flame 104 to produce a counter-clockwise swirl or
      vortex effect in the flame, for example when a field-reactive
      movement of species is dominated by negatively charged species.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] While the electrode configuration and electric field
      sequence shown in FIGS. 1 and 2A-2C is shown as an embodiment
      using a relatively simple configuration of three electrodes and
      three field axes, other configurations may be preferable for some
      embodiments and some applications. For example an electric field
      may exist simultaneously between more than two electrodes. The
      number of electrodes may be increased significantly. The timing of
      electric field switching may be changed, may be made at a
      non-constant interval, may be made to variable potentials, may be
      informed by feedback control, etc. The electrode configuration may
      be altered significantly, such as by integration into the
      combustion chamber wall, placement behind the combustion chamber
      wall, etc. Furthermore, electrodes may be placed such that the
      electric field angle varies in more than one plane, such as by
      placing some electrodes proximal and other electrodes distal
      relative to the burner nozzle. In other embodiments, a given
      electrode may be limited to one state (such as either positive or
      negative) plus neutral. In other embodiments, all electrodes may
      be limited to one state (such as either positive or negative) plus
      neutral.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] FIG. 3 is block diagram of a system 301 configured to
      provide a time-varying electric field across a combustion volume
      103, according to an embodiment. An electronic controller 302 is
      configured to produce a plurality of time-varying waveforms for
      driving a plurality of electrodes 106, 108 and 110. The waveforms
      may be formed at least partly by a sequencer (not shown) forming a
      portion of the controller 302. The sequencer may be formed from a
      software algorithm, a state machine, etc. operatively coupled to
      the output node 306. The waveforms are transmitted to an amplifier
      304 via one or more signal lines 306. The amplifier amplifies the
      waveforms to respective voltages for energizing the electrodes
      106, 108, and 110 via the respective electrode leads 112, 114, and
      116.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] According to an embodiment, the waveforms may be produced
      by the controller 302 at a constant frequency. According to
      embodiments, the constant frequency may be fixed or selectable.
      According to another embodiment, the waveforms by be produced at a
      non-constant frequency. For example, a non-constant period or
      segment of a period may help to provide a spread-spectrum field
      sequence and may help to avoid resonance conditions or other
      interference problems.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] According to an illustrative embodiment, electrode drive
      waveforms may be produced at about 1 KHz. According to another
      embodiment, electrode drive waveforms may be produced with a
      period corresponding to about 10 KHz. According to another
      embodiment, electrode drive waveforms may be produced at about 20
      KHz. According to an illustrative embodiment, the amplifier 304
      may drive the electrodes 106, 108, and 110 to about 900 volts.
      According to another embodiment, the amplifier 304 may drive the
      electrodes 106, 108, 110 to about +450 and -450 volts. As
      mentioned elsewhere, portions of a period may include opening a
      circuit to one or more electrodes to let its voltage “float”.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] According to some embodiments, it may be desirable to set
      or vary the electric field frequency and/or the voltage of the
      electrodes, and/or to provide sense feedback such as a safety
      interlock or measurements of flame-related, electric
      field-related, or other parameters. FIG. 4 is block diagram of a
      system 401 configured to receive or transmit at least one
      combustion or electric field parameter and/or at least one sensor
      input. The system 401 may responsively provide a time-varying
      electric field across a combustion volume 103 as a function of the
      at least one combustion parameter and/or at least one sensor
      input, according to another embodiment. For example, the
      modulation frequency of the electric field states and/or the
      electrode voltage may be varied as a function of a fuel delivery
      rate, a desired energy output rate, or other desired operational
      parameter.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] The controller 302 may be operatively coupled to one or
      more of a parameter communication module 402 and a sensor input
      module 404, such as via a data communication bus 406. The
      parameter communication module 402 may provide a facility to
      update software, firmware, etc used by the controller 302. Such
      updates may include look-up table and/or algorithm updates such as
      may be determined by modeling, learned via previous system
      measurements, etc. The parameter communication module 402 may
      further be used to communicate substantially real time operating
      parameters to the controller 302. The parameter communication
      module 402 may further be used to communicate operating status,
      fault conditions, firmware or software version, sensor values,
      etc. from the controller 302 to external systems (not shown).<br>
      <br>
      [0042] A sensor input module 404 may provide sensed values to the
      controller 302 via the data communication bus 406. Sensed values
      received from the sensor input module 404 may include parameters
      not sensed by external systems and therefore unavailable via the
      parameter communication module 402. Alternatively, sensed values
      received from the sensor input module 404 may include parameters
      that are also reported from external systems via the parameter
      communication module 402.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] Parameters such as a fuel flow rate, stack gas temperature,
      stack gas optical density, combustion volume temperature,
      combustion volume luminosity, combustion volume ionization,
      ionization near one or more electrodes, combustion volume open,
      combustion volume maintenance lockout, electrical fault, etc. may
      be communicated to the controller 302 from the parameter input
      module 402, sensor input module 404, and/or via feedback through
      the amplifier 304.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] Voltage drive to the electrodes 106, 108, 110 may be shut
      off in the event of a safety condition state and/or a manual
      shut-down command received through the parameter input. Similarly,
      a fault state in the system 401 may be communicated to an external
      system to force a shutdown of fuel or otherwise enter a safe
      state.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] The controller may determine waveforms for driving the
      electrodes 106, 108, 110 responsive to the received parameters,
      feedback, and sensed values (referred to collectively as
      “parameters”). For example the parameters may be optionally
      combined, compared, differentiated, integrated, etc. Parameters or
      combinations of parameters may be input to a control algorithm
      such as an algorithmic calculation, a table look-up, a
      proportional-integral-differential (PID) control algorithm, fuzzy
      logic, or other mechanism to determine waveform parameters. The
      determined waveform parameters may include, for example, selection
      of electrodes, sequencing of electrodes, waveform frequency or
      period, electrode voltage, etc.<br>
      <br>
      [0046] The parameters may be determined, for example, according to
      optimization of a response variable such for maximizing thermal
      output from the combustion volume, maximizing an extent of
      reaction in the combustion volume, maximizing stack clarity from
      the combustion volume, minimizing pollutant output from the
      combustion volume, maximizing the temperature of the combustion
      volume, meeting a target temperature in the combustion volume,
      minimizing luminous output from a flame in the combustion volume,
      achieving a desired flicker in a flame in the combustion volume,
      maximizing luminous output from a flame in the combustion volume,
      maximizing fuel efficiency, maximizing power output, compensating
      for maintenance issues, maximizing system life, compensating for
      fuel variations, compensating for a fuel source, etc.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] According to an embodiment, waveforms generated by the
      controller 302 may be transmitted to the amplifier 304 via one or
      more dedicated waveform transmission nodes 306. Alternatively,
      waveforms may be transmitted via the data bus 406. The amplifier
      304 may provide status, synchronization, fault or other feedback
      via dedicated nodes 306 or may alternatively communicate status to
      the controller 302 and/or the parameter communication module 402
      via the data bus 406.<br>
      <br>
      [0048] While the controller 302 and amplifier 304 of FIGS. 3 and 4
      are illustrated as discrete modules, they may be integrated.
      Similarly, the parameter communications module 402 and/or sensor
      input module 404 may be integrated with the controller 302 and/or
      amplifier 304.<br>
      <br>
      [0049] An illustrative set of waveforms is shown in FIG. 5, which
      may form a timing diagram 501 showing waveforms 502, 504, 506 for
      controlling electrode modulation, according to an embodiment. Each
      of the waveforms 502, 504, and 506 are shown registered with one
      another along a horizontal axis indicative of time, each shown as
      varying between a high voltage, VH, a ground state, 0, and a low
      voltage VL. According to an embodiment, the waveforms 502, 504,
      506 correspond respectively to energization patterns delivered to
      the electrodes 106, 108 and 110.<br>
      <br>
      [0050] The voltages VH, 0, and VL may represent relatively low
      voltages delivered to the amplifier 304 from the controller 302
      via the amplifier drive line(s) 306. Similarly, the voltages VH,
      0, and VL may represent relatively large voltages delivered by the
      amplifier 304 to the respective electrodes 106, 108, 110 via the
      respective electrode drive lines 112, 114, 116. The waveforms 502,
      504, 506 may be provided to repeat in a periodic pattern with a
      period P. During a first portion 508 of the period P, waveform 502
      drives electrode 106 high while waveform 504 drives electrode 108
      low, and waveform 506 drives electrode 110 to an intermediate
      voltage. Alternatively, portion 508 of waveform 506 (and
      corresponding intermediate states in the other waveforms 502, 504)
      may represent opening the electrode drive such that the electrode
      floats.<br>
      <br>
      [0051] Waveform portion 508 corresponds to the electric field
      state 202 shown in FIG. 2A. That is VH is applied to electrode 106
      while VL is applied to electrode 108 to form an idealized electric
      field 204 between electrodes 106 and 108. Electrode 110 is either
      allowed to float or held at an intermediate potential such that
      reduced or substantially no electric fields are generated between
      it and the other electrodes.<br>
      <br>
      [0052] During a second portion 510 of the period P, waveform 502
      indicates that electrode 106 is held open to “float” or
      alternatively is driven to an intermediate voltage, 0 while
      waveform 504 drives electrode 108 high to VH and waveform 506
      drives electrode 110 to a low voltage VL. Waveform portion 510
      corresponds to the electric field state 206 shown in FIG. 2B. That
      is, VH is applied to electrode 108 while VL is applied to
      electrode 110 to form an idealized electric field 208 between
      electrodes 108 and 110. Electrode 106 is either allowed to float
      or held at an intermediate potential such that reduced or
      substantially no electric fields are generated between it and the
      other electrodes.<br>
      <br>
      [0053] During a third portion 512 of the period P, waveform 504
      indicates that electrode 108 is held open to “float” or
      alternatively is driven to an intermediate voltage, 0 while
      waveform 506 drives electrode 110 high to VH and waveform 502
      drives electrode 106 to a low voltage VL. Waveform portion 512
      corresponds to the electric field state 210 shown in FIG. 2B. That
      is, VH is applied to electrode 110 while VL is applied to
      electrode 106 to form an idealized electric field 212 between
      electrodes 110 and 106. Electrode 108 is either allowed to float
      or held at an intermediate potential such that reduced or
      substantially no electric fields are generated between it and the
      other electrodes. Proceeding to the next portion 508, the periodic
      pattern is repeated.<br>
      <br>
      [0054] While the waveforms 502, 504, and 506 of timing diagram 501
      indicates that each of the portions 508, 510, and 512 of the
      period P are substantially equal in duration, the periods may be
      varied somewhat or modulated such as to reduce resonance behavior,
      accommodate variations in combustion volume 103 geometry, etc.
      Additionally or alternatively, the periods P may be varied in
      duration. Similarly, while the voltage levels VH, 0, and VL are
      shown as substantially equal to one another, they may also be
      varied from electrode-to-electrode, from period portion to period
      portion, and/or from period-to-period.<br>
      <br>
      [0055] Returning to the waveforms 501 of FIG. 5, it may be seen
      that at a first point in time during the period portion 508, there
      is a potential difference and a corresponding electric field
      between an electrode corresponding to the waveform 502 and an
      electrode corresponding to the waveform 504. This is because the
      waveform 502 has driven a corresponding electrode to a relatively
      high potential and the waveform 504 has driven a corresponding
      electrode to a relatively low potential. Simultaneously, there is
      a reduced or substantially no electric field formed between an
      electrode corresponding to waveform 502 and an electrode
      corresponding to waveform 506, because waveform 506 has driven the
      potential of the corresponding electrode to an intermediate
      potential or has opened the circuit to let the electrode float.
      Similarly, at a second time corresponding to period portion 512,
      there is a potential difference and corresponding electric field
      between an electrode corresponding to the waveform 502 and an
      electrode corresponding to the waveform 506, but a reduced or
      substantially no potential difference or electric field between an
      electrode corresponding to the waveform 502 and an electrode
      corresponding to the waveform 504.<br>
      <br>
      [0056] While the waveforms 502, 504, and 506 are shown as
      idealizes square waves, their shape may be varied. For example,
      leading and trailing edges may exhibit voltage overshoot or
      undershoot; leading and trailing edges may be transitioned less
      abruptly, such as by applying a substantially constant dl/dt
      circuit, optionally with acceleration; or the waveforms may be
      modified in other ways, such as by applying sine functions, etc.<br>
      <br>
      [0057] FIG. 6 is a diagram 601 illustrating waveforms 602, 604,
      606 for controlling electrode modulation according to another
      embodiment. The waveforms 602, 604, and 606 may, for example, be
      created from the corresponding waveforms 502, 504, 506 of FIG. 5
      by driving the square waveforms through an R/C filter, such as
      driving through natural impedance. Alternatively, the waveforms
      602, 604, and 606, may be digitally synthesized, driven by a
      harmonic sine-function generator, etc.<br>
      <br>
      [0058] While the period portions 508, 510, and 512 may or may not
      correspond exactly to the corresponding portions of FIG. 5, they
      may be generally regarded as driving the electrodes 106, 108, and
      110 to corresponding states as shown in FIGS. 2A-2C. The period P
      may be conveniently determined from a zero crossing as shown, or
      may be calculated to a position corresponding to the position
      shown in FIG. 5.<br>
      <br>
      [0059] As may be appreciated, when waveforms such as 602, 604, 606
      drive corresponding electrodes 106, 108, 110; the idealized
      electric fields 204, 208, 212 of FIGS. 2A-2C may not represent the
      actual fields as closely as when waveforms such as 502, 504, 506
      of FIG. 5 are used. For example, at the beginning of period
      portion 508 waveform 602 ramps up from an intermediate voltage, 0
      to a high voltage VH while waveform 604 ramps down from an
      intermediate voltage, 0 to a low voltage VL and waveform 606 ramps
      down from a high voltage VH toward an intermediate voltage 0.
      Thus, the electric field 212 of FIG. 2C “fades” to the electric
      field 204 of FIG. 2A during the beginning of period portion 508.
      During the end of period portion 508, waveform 604 ramps up toward
      high voltage while waveform 606 continues to decrease and waveform
      602 begins its descent from its maximum value. This may tend to
      fade electric field 204 toward the configuration 206, as are small
      reversed sign field 212 appears, owing to the potential between
      electrodes 106 and 110.<br>
      <br>
      [0060] Returning to the waveforms 601 of FIG. 6, it may be seen
      that at a first point in time 608, there is a potential difference
      and a corresponding electric field between an electrode
      corresponding to the waveform 602 and an electrode corresponding
      to the waveform 604. This is because the waveform 602 has driven a
      corresponding electrode to a relatively high potential and the
      waveform 604 has driven a corresponding electrode to a relatively
      low potential. Simultaneously, there is substantially no electric
      field formed between an electrode corresponding to waveform 602
      and an electrode corresponding to waveform 606, because waveforms
      602 and 606 are momentarily at the same potential. Similarly, at a
      second point in time 610, there is a potential difference and
      corresponding electric field between an electrode corresponding to
      the waveform 602 and an electrode corresponding to the waveform
      606, but no potential difference or electric field between an
      electrode corresponding to the waveform 602 and an electrode
      corresponding to the waveform 604.<br>
      <br>
      [0061] FIG. 7 is a diagram 701 illustrating waveforms 702, 704,
      706 for controlling modulation of the respective electrodes 106,
      108, 110 according to another embodiment. Waveform 702 begins a
      period P during a portion 708 at a relatively high voltage VH,
      corresponding to a relatively high voltage at electrode 106. Also
      during the portion 708, waveform 704 begins the period P at a
      relatively low voltage VL, corresponding to a relatively low
      voltage at electrode 108; and waveform 706 corresponds to an open
      condition at electrode 110. Waveform portion 708 may be referred
      to as a first pulse period.<br>
      <br>
      [0062] During the first pulse period 708, the electric field
      configuration in a driven combustion volume 103 may correspond to
      configuration 202, shown in FIG. 2A. As was described earlier, the
      nominal electric field 204 of configuration 202 may tend to
      attract positively charged species toward electrode 108 and
      attract negatively charged species toward electrode 106.<br>
      <br>
      [0063] After the first pulse period 708, waveforms 702 and 704
      drive respective electrodes 106 and 108 open while waveform 706
      maintains the open circuit condition at electrode 110. During a
      portion 710 of the period P, the electrodes 106, 108, and 110 are
      held open and thus substantially no electric field is applied to
      the flame or the combustion volume. However, inertia imparted onto
      charged species during the preceding first pulse period 708 may
      remain during the non-pulse period 710, and the charged species
      may thus remain in motion. Such motion may be nominally along
      trajectories present at the end of the first pulse period 708, as
      modified by subsequent collisions and interactions with other
      particles.<br>
      <br>
      [0064] At the conclusion of the first non-pulse portion 710 of the
      period P, a second pulse period 712 begins. During the second
      pulse period 712, waveform 702 provides an open electrical
      condition at electrode 106 while waveform 704 goes to a relatively
      high voltage to drive electrode 108 to a corresponding relatively
      high voltage and waveform 706 goes to a relatively low voltage to
      drive electrode 110 to a corresponding relatively low voltage.
      Thus during the second pulse period 712, an electric field
      configuration 206 of FIG. 2B occurs. This is again followed by a
      non-pulse portion of the waveforms 710, during which inertia
      effects may tend to maintain the speed and trajectory of charged
      species present at the end of the second pulse period 712, as
      modified by subsequent collisions and interactions with other
      particles.<br>
      <br>
      [0065] At the conclusion of the second non-pulse portion 710, a
      third pulse period 714 begins, which may for example create an
      electric field configuration similar to electric field
      configuration 210, shown in FIG. 2C. After the third pulse period
      714 ends, the system may again enter a non-pulse portion 710. This
      may continue over a plurality of periods, such as to provide a
      pseudo steady state repetition of the period P portions 708, 710,
      712, 710, 714, 710, etc.<br>
      <br>
      [0066] According to one embodiment, the pulse periods and
      non-pulse portions may provide about a 25% duty cycle pulse train,
      as illustrated, wherein there is a field generated between two
      electrodes about 25% of the time and no applied electric fields
      the other 75% of the time. The duty cycle may be varied according
      to conditions within the combustion volume 103, such as may be
      determined by a feedback circuit and/or parameter input circuit as
      shown in FIGS. 3 and 4.<br>
      <br>
      [0067] According to another embodiment, the pulse periods 708,
      712, and 714 may each be about 10 microseconds duration and the
      period P may be about 1 KHz frequency, equivalent to 1 millisecond
      period. Thus, the non-pulse portions may each be about 323.333
      microseconds.<br>
      <br>
      [0068] The relative charge-to-mass ratio of a particular charged
      species may affect its response to the intermittent pulse periods
      708, 712, 714 and intervening non-pulse portions 710. The duty
      cycle may be varied to achieve a desired movement of one or more
      charged species in the combustion volume 103. According to an
      embodiment, waveforms 702, 704, 706 optimized to transport a
      positively charged species clockwise may be superimposed over
      other waveforms 702', 704', 706' optimized to transport another
      positively charged species or a negatively charged species
      clockwise or counterclockwise to produce a third set of waveforms
      702?, 704?, 706? that achieve transport of differing species in
      desired respective paths.<br>
      <br>
      [0069] For example, a heavy, positive species may require a
      relatively high, 50% duty cycle with a relatively long period to
      move along a chosen path. A light, negative species may require a
      relatively low duty cycle with a relatively short period to move
      along a chosen path. The two waveforms may be superimposed to
      drive the positive and negative species in parallel (clockwise or
      counter-clockwise) or anti-parallel (clockwise and
      counter-clockwise) to each other.<br>
      <br>
      [0070] While the electrodes 106, 108, 110 are shown arranged in
      figures above such that a straight line connecting any two
      electrodes passes through the volume of an intervening flame,
      other arrangements may be within the scope. While the number of
      electrodes 106, 108, 110 shown in the embodiments above is three,
      other numbers greater than three may similarly fall within the
      scope. While the electrodes 106, 108, 110 are indicated as
      cylindrical conductors arranged parallel to the major axis of the
      burner nozzle, other arrangements may fall within the scope.<br>
      <br>
      [0071] For example, in another embodiment, a plurality of
      electrodes are arranged substantially at the corners of a cube,
      and include plates of finite size having normal axes that
      intersect at the center of the cube, which corresponds to the
      supported flame 104. In other embodiments (not shown) the
      electrodes may include surfaces or figurative points arranged at
      the centers of the faces of a cube, at the corners or at the
      centers of the faces of a geodesic sphere, etc.<br>
