        </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</b><b><br>
        </b><b><br>
        </b>In the following detailed description, reference is made to
        the accompanying drawings, which form a part hereof. In the
        drawings, similar symbols typically identify similar components,
        unless context dictates otherwise. The illustrative embodiments
        described in the detailed description, drawings, and claims are
        not meant to be limiting. Other embodiments may be utilized, and
        other changes may be made, without departing from the spirit or
        scope of the subject matter presented here.<br>
        <br>
        FIG. 1 is a diagram of a burner system 101 including a burner
        102 configured to support a flame 104 and at least one inertial
        electrode launcher 1 10 configured to launch an inertial
        electrode 1 12 in proximity to the flame 104 or combustion gas 1
        16 produced by the flame. The flame may carry first charged
        particles 106. The inertial electrode 1 12 may include charged
        particles 1 14 and/or may carry a voltage. The inertial
        electrode launcher 1 10 is configured to impart inertia onto the
        inertial electrode 1 12. The inertia imparted onto the inertial
        electrode 1 12 and/or the charged particles 1 14 and/or voltage
        carried by the inertial electrode 1 12 may be selected to cause
        the flame 104 or the combustion gas stream 1 16 to respond to
        the inertia, the charged particles 1 14, and/or the voltage
        carried by the inertial electrode 1 12.<br>
        <br>
        The inertia imparted onto the inertial electrode 1 12, the
        charged particles 1 14, and/or the voltage carried by the
        inertial electrode 1 12 may be selected to cause the first
        charged particles 106 carried by the flame 104 or a combustion
        gas stream 1 16 to respond to the inertia and to the charged
        particles 1 14 or voltage carried by the inertial electrode 1
        12. Acceleration imparted on the charged particles 106 may be
        transferred to uncharged particles in the flame 104 or
        combustion gas 1 16 to produce an overall movement of the flame,
        change a reaction rate of the flame, flatten the flame, lengthen
        the flame, bend the flame, affect a location of the flame 104,
        direct the flame 104 or combustion gas 1 16, or otherwise affect
        the flame 104 or combustion gas 1 16.<br>
        <br>
        According to an embodiment, the inertial electrode may be
        selected to impart a majority charge on the flame 104 or on the
        combustion gas stream 1 16 produced by the flame. As indicated
        above, the inertial electrode 1 12 may be configured to affect a
        shape or location of the flame 104 and/or to affect a
        concentration or distribution of the charged particles 106 in
        the flame 104.<br>
        <br>
        Optionally, the inertial electrode launcher 1 10 and inertial
        electrode 1 12 may respectively include a plurality of inertial
        electrode launchers 1 10 and inertial electrodes 1 12.<br>
        <br>
        An electrode driver 1 18 may be configured to drive the inertial
        electrode launcher(s) 1 10. The electrode driver 1 18 may be
        configured to periodically or intermittently cooperate with the
        inertial electrode launcher 1 10 to change a concentration of
        the charged particles 1 14 or the voltage carried by the
        inertial electrode 1 12. For example, the electrode driver 1 18
        may be configured to periodically or intermittently change a
        sign of the charged particles 1 14 or the voltage carried by the
        inertial electrode 1 12.<br>
        <br>
        Optionally, the inertial electrode launcher 1 10 may include or
        be coupled to a directional actuator (not shown) configured to
        determine a direction the inertial electrode 1 12 is launched by
        the inertial electrode launcher 1 10. The electrode driver 1 18
        may be configured to control the directional actuator.<br>
        <br>
        Optionally, the inertial electrode launcher 1 10 may include a
        location actuator (not shown) configured to determine a location
        from which the inertial electrode 1 12 is launched by the
        inertial electrode launcher 1 10. The electrode driver 1 18 may
        be configured to control the location actuator.<br>
        <br>
        The burner 102 may include a fuel source 120 configured to
        provide fuel for the flame 104 and an insulator or gap 122
        configured to isolate charges 106 in the flame 104 and charges 1
        14 or voltage carried by the inertial electrode 1 12 from
        ground. A flame holder 124 may be configured to hold the flame
        104. For example, the flame holder 124 may be referred to as a
        bluff body.<br>
        <br>
        The flame 104 may be a diffusion flame, for example.
        Alternatively, the burner 102 may be configured to at least
        partially premix the fuel and an oxidizer such as oxygen
        contained in air.<br>
        <br>
        The burner system 101 may include or be operatively coupled to
        an object 126 selected to be heated by the flame 104 or selected
        to be protected from heating by the flame 104. For example, the
        object 126 may include a furnace wall, a boiler wall, a
        combustor wall, a heat transfer surface, an air-to-air heat
        exchanger, an air-to-liquid heat exchanger, a chemical reactor,
        a sensor, a turbine blade, a fireplace, and/or an object in an
        environment exposed to the flame 104. The inertial electrode
        launcher 1 10 may be configured to launch an inertial electrode
        1 12 carrying charges 1 14 or a voltage selected to cause the
        flame 104 or combustion gas 1 16 produced by the flame 104 to
        transfer relatively more heat to the object 126. Alternatively,
        the inertial electrode launcher 1 10 may be configured to cause
        the flame 104 or combustion gas 1 16 to transfer relatively less
        heat to the object 126. The object 126 may be electrically
        grounded or may be driven to a voltage. For example, the object
        126 may be driven to or held at a voltage having an opposite
        sign compared to the sign of the charges 1 14 or the voltage
        carried by the inertial electrode 1 12. Alternatively, the
        object 126 may be driven to or held at a voltage having the same
        sign compared to the sign of the charges or the voltage carried
        by the inertial electrode 1 12. According to other embodiments,
        the object 126 may be insulated from ground and not driven to a
        voltage different than a voltage imparted by cooperation of the
        inertial electrode 1 12 with the flame 104. For example, the
        object 126 may follow an AC or chopped DC waveform applied by
        the electrode controller 1 18.<br>
        <br>
        Various assemblies are contemplated with respect to embodiments
        of the inertial electrode launcher 1 10.<br>
        <br>
        FIG. 2 is a diagram showing an embodiment including an apparatus
        201 configured to support a flame 1 12 that acts as a virtual
        electrode. An inertial electrode burner 202 may at least
        intermittently or periodically support a flame inertial
        electrode 1 12. An inertial electrode launcher charging
        apparatus 204 may be configured to attract from the flame
        inertial electrode 1 12 charges 206 to create a majority sign of
        the charged particles 1 14 carried by the flame inertial
        electrode 1 12 or to add the majority sign charges to the flame
        inertial electrode. In an embodiment, the charging apparatus 204
        may include a depletion electrode energized to the same polarity
        as the desired majority sign charges. Mobility of the inertial
        electrode charged particles 1 14 carried by the flame 1 12 may
        cause the flame inertial electrode 1 12 to carry a measurable
        voltage.<br>
        <br>
        For example, the inertial electrode launcher depletion electrode
        204 may be driven to a positive voltage, attracting negative
        charges 206 to the inertial electrode launcher depletion
        electrode 204, leaving positive majority charges 1 14 in the
        flame inertial electrode 1 12, or at least a portion of the
        flame inertial electrode 1 12. Conversely, if the inertial
        electrode launcher depletion electrode 204 is driven to a
        negative voltage, positive charges 206 may be attracted to the
        inertial electrode launcher depletion electrode 204, leaving
        negative majority charges 1 14 in the flame inertial electrode 1
        12. Alternatively, the inertial electrode launcher charging
        apparatus 204 may be configured to output the majority charges
        to the flame inertial electrode. For example, the inertial
        launcher charging apparatus may be formed as a corona electrode
        configured to eject charges having the same sign as the desired
        flame inertial electrode majority charge.<br>
        <br>
        The inertial electrode launcher charging apparatus 204 may be
        formed by at least a portion of a boiler wall, or other
        structure associated with the function of the burner.
        Alternatively, the inertial electrode launcher charging
        apparatus 204 may be an extrinsic structure introduced into a
        burner volume through an air gap or insulated and/or shielded
        sleeve. According to other embodiments, the inertial electrode
        launcher charging apparatus 204 may be formed by the inertial
        electrode burner 202 or by an electrical conductor intrinsic to
        the inertial electrode burner 202.<br>
        <br>
        The electrode driver 1 18 may be configured to apply a voltage
        to the electrode launcher charging apparatus 204 to control at
        least one of the sign or density of the charged particles 1 14
        in the flame inertial electrode 1 12.<br>
        <br>
        A valve 208 may be configured to control a flow of fuel to the
        flame inertial electrode burner 202. The electrode driver 1 18
        may be configured to control the valve 208. An igniter or pilot
        (not shown) may be configured to ignite the flame inertial
        electrode 1 12 when the valve 208 is opened. An electrical
        insulator or gap 210 may be configured to electrically isolate
        the flame inertial electrode 1 12 from ground or another
        voltage.<br>
        <br>
        Referring to FIGS. 1 and 2, the burner system 101 and the
        inertial electrode burner 202 may be configured according to a
        "flame-on-flame" architecture where the flame electrode 202
        imparts a charge on the flame 104 and/or anchors the flame 104.
        For example, the inertial electrode burner 202 may be arranged
        to be protected from a fluid flow past the burner 102. The flame
        inertial electrode 1 12 may be configured as a flame holder for
        a flame 104 subject to higher velocity fluid flow. The
        arrangement for protection of the inertial electrode burner 202
        from the fluid flow past the burner 102 may include positioning
        the inertial electrode burner 202 in the lee of a physical fluid
        flow barrier (not shown).<br>
        <br>
        FIG. 3 is a diagram of an inertial electrode launcher embodiment
        301 where an inertial electrode launcher is configured to
        project a charged vapor or aerosol virtual electrode 1 12. A
        body 302 may define a vaporization well 304. First and second
        electrodes 306a, 306b operatively coupled to an electrode driver
        1 18 may be configured to apply a high voltage to a liquid 308
        at least temporarily confined by the vaporization well 304 to
        vaporize the liquid 308 to produce a inertial electrode 1 12
        including vapor, aerosol, or vapor and aerosol of the liquid 308
        carrying charged particles 1 14. The electrode driver 1 18 may
        be configured to apply the high voltage with a voltage bias
        having a same sign as a sign of charge carried by a majority of
        the charged particles 1 14 carried by the inertial electrode 1
        12.<br>
        <br>
        A flow passage 310 may be configured to admit liquid or other
        vaporizing material 308 to the vaporization well 304. A valve or
        actuator 312 may be configured to enable a flow of the liquid
        308 through the fluid flow passage 310 to the vaporization well
        304. The valve or actuator 312 may be operatively coupled to the
        electrode driver 1 18. The inertial electrode launcher 1 10 may
        include a nozzle 314 configured to determine a direction of
        travel 316 of the vapor, aerosol, or vapor and aerosol of the
        vaporizing material 308 forming the inertial electrode 1 12. An
        actuator (not shown) may be configured to align the nozzle 314
        to an intended direction of travel 316 of the vapor, aerosol, or
        vapor and aerosol of the liquid 308 forming the inertial
        electrode 1 12. The actuator (not shown) may be operatively
        coupled to the electrode driver 1 18<br>
        <br>
        The vaporizing material may include a liquid such as water. The
        liquid may include a buffer solution or be at least partly
        functional ized to hold the charge 1 14. The bias voltage may be
        positive at least intermittently or periodically. A majority of
        the charged particles 1 14 may carry a positive charge at least
        intermittently or periodically corresponding to the (positive)
        bias voltage. Alternatively, the bias voltage may be negative at
        least intermittently or periodically. A majority of the charged
        particles 1 14 may carry a negative charge at least
        intermittently or periodically corresponding to the (negative)
        bias voltage.<br>
        <br>
        FIG. 4 is a diagram of an embodiment of an inertial electrode
        launcher configured to project solid particles 406 to a location
        proximate the flame 104 or combustion gas 1 16. A body 402 may
        define an orifice 404 from which the solid particles 406 are
        projected. The projected solid particles 406 may include charged
        particles 1 14. One or more solid particles may form the
        inertial electrode 1 12.<br>
        <br>
        The body 402 may include a wall of a furnace or boiler. The body
        402 may include refractory material. The orifice 404 may include
        a Venturi, for example. The solid particles may be configured to
        be projected by an entrainment fluid 408 passing through the
        orifice 404. The entrainment fluid 408 may include air.
        Additionally or alternatively, the entrainment fluid 408 may
        include an overfire oxidizer.<br>
        <br>
        A particle channel 410 may be positioned adjacent to the orifice
        404. The solid particles 406 may be injected into a passing
        entrainment fluid at the orifice 404 through the particle
        channel 410. The electrode driver 1 18 may be operatively
        coupled to the inertial electrode launcher 401 . The particle
        valve 412 may be operatively coupled to the electrode driver 1
        18. The electrode driver 1 18 may be configured to control at
        least one of a rate of flow of particles through the particle
        channel 410 or a periodic or intermittent particle flow through
        the particle channel 410. A corona surface 414 may be configured
        to be driven to sufficient voltage to cause an emission of
        charges. At least some of the charges emitted by the corona may
        be deposited on the solid particles 406. The corona surface 414
        may include a corona wire, corotron, and/or scorotron. The
        electrode driver 1 18 may be configured to control the voltage
        to which the corona surface 414 is driven.<br>
        <br>
        Referring to FIGS. 1 and 4, a voltage sign to which the corona
        surface 414 is driven and the charge sign of the majority
        charged particles 1 14 carried by the inertial electrode 1 12
        may be the same as a voltage carried by an object 126.
        Alternatively, the voltage sign to which the corona surface 414
        is driven and the charge sign of the majority charged particles
        1 14 carried by the inertial electrode 1 12 may be opposite to a
        voltage carried by the object 126.<br>
        <br>
        An actuator (not shown) may be configured to align the orifice
        404 to an intended direction of travel 416 of the charged solid
        particles 406 forming the inertial electrode 1 12. The actuator
        may be operatively coupled to the electrode driver 1 18. One or
        more steering electrodes (not shown) may be operatively coupled
        to the electrode driver 1 18. The electrode driver 1 18 may be
        configured to energize the one or more steering electrodes (not
        shown) to deflect the charged solid particles 406 forming the
        inertial electrode 1 12 toward an intended direction of travel
        416.<br>
        <br>
        Optionally, the orifice 404 may be arranged to be protected from
        a fluid flow past the burner 102. The inertial electrode 1 12
        may be configured as a flame holder for the flame 104. The
        arrangement for protection of the orifice 404 from the fluid
        flow past the burner 102 may include positioning the inertial
        electrode launcher 1 10 in the lee of a physical fluid flow
        barrier (not shown). The particles 406 may include coal, coke,
        or carbon. Additionally or alternatively, the particles 406 may
        be selected to react in the flame 104 or with combustion gas 1
        16 produced by the flame 104.<br>
        <br>
        FIG. 5 is diagram showing an embodiment of the inertial
        electrode launcher 1 10 formed as a nozzle 502 configured to at
        least intermittently or periodically receive a voltage from the
        electrode driver 1 18 and to expel a fluid 510 carrying charged
        particles 1 14 and/or a voltage. The fluid carrying the charged
        particles and/or voltage may form the inertial electrode 1 12.
        The fluid 510 may include a liquid such as water. The fluid 510
        may include a buffer or be functionalized to hold the charge.<br>
        <br>
        The burner system 101 may include a valve 504 operatively
        coupled to the electrode driver 1 18 and a fluid supply system
        506 in communication with the nozzle 502 through the valve 504.
        The valve may be configured to respond to an actuation signal
        from the electrode driver 1 18 to at least intermittently or
        periodically open flow of the fluid from a fluid supply system
        506 to flow through the nozzle 502. The fluid supply system 506
        may be configured to supply the fluid 510 to the nozzle 502 and
        maintain electrical isolation between the fluid 510 and a fluid
        source 516. The fluid supply system 506 may include tank 508 to
        hold the fluid 510, the tank being made of an electrically
        insulating material or being supported by electrical insulators
        512 to isolate the fluid 510 from ground or another voltage. An
        antisiphon arrangement 514 may be configured to maintain
        electrical isolation between the fluid 510 and the fluid source
        516.<br>
        <br>
        Referring to FIGS. 1 and 5, the burner system 101 may include an
        object 126 configured to be held at a voltage disposed proximate
        to the flame 104 or combustion gas 1 16 produced by the flame
        104. A voltage sign to which the nozzle 502 is driven and the
        majority charge sign of the fluid charges 1 14 carried by the
        inertial electrode 1 12 may be the same as a sign of the voltage
        held by the object 126. Alternatively, the voltage sign to which
        the nozzle 502 is driven and the majority charge sign of the
        fluid charges 1 14 carried by the inertial electrode 1 12 may be
        opposite of a sign of the voltage held by the object 126.<br>
        <br>
        The fluid may form the inertial electrode 1 12 as a stream
        emitted from the nozzle 502. An actuator (not shown) operatively
        coupled to the electrode driver 1 18 may be configured to align
        the nozzle 502 to an intended direction of travel of the
        inertial electrode 1 12.<br>
        <br>
        FIG. 6 is a flowchart showing a method 601 for operating a
        burner system 101 , according to an embodiment. The method 601
        may begin with step 602 wherein a flame may be supported with a
        burner. Proceeding to step 604, a charge sign or voltage maybe
        be selected for an inertial electrode. Selecting a charge sign
        or voltage for the inertial electrode may include selecting a
        sequence of different charge signs or voltages. Selecting a
        charge sign or voltage for the inertial electrode may include
        selecting a time-varying sign of the charged particles or
        voltage carried by the inertial electrode. For example, step 604
        may include selecting an alternating current (AC) voltage
        waveform, a chopped DC waveform, or other time-varying or
        periodic voltage that imparts a charge, charge concentration, or
        voltage variation on the inertial electrode.<br>
        <br>
        Proceeding to step 606, the inertial electrode may be launched
        in proximity to the flame or combustion gas produced by the
        flame. A selected time-varying sign of the charged particles or
        voltage selected in step 604 may be carried by the inertial
        electrode launched in step 606. For inertial electrodes that are
        non-continuous, the start of inertial electrode projection may
        tend to include a voltage or charge concentration corresponding
        to the portion of the waveform corresponding to onset of
        electrode projection, with the charge concentration or voltage
        in the inertial electrode then varying with the voltage applied
        to the inertial electrode launcher until the inertial electrode
        projection is again shut off. Alternatively, a voltage applied
        to all or a portion of the inertial electrode launcher may be
        held continuous, and the timing of application of a
        correspondingly charged or voltage carrying inertial electrode
        to proximity to the flame or combustion gas may be determined by
        controlling the timing of inertial electrode on and inertial
        electrode off times.<br>
        <br>
        Proceeding to step 608, the flame or combustion gas produced by
        the flame may be affected by the inertial electrode. For
        example, the flame may include at least transiently present
        charged particles (such as in charge-balanced proportion or as a
        majority charge). A variety of ways for the flame or the
        combustion gas to be affected by the inertial electrode are
        contemplated. For example, the inertial electrode may affect a
        rate of reaction by interaction in the flame. Additionally or
        alternatively, a shape of the flame or a flow direction of the
        combustion gas may vary responsive to the inertial electrode.<br>
        <br>
        The inertial electrode may cause the flame or combustion gas to<br>
        <br>
        preferentially transfer heat to the object. The object may be
        electrically grounded. The inertial electrode may impart
        electrically charged particles onto the flame or the combustion
        gas such that the electrically charged particles and heat from
        the flame or the combustion gas is electrically attracted to the
        electrically grounded object to preferentially provide the heat.<br>
        <br>
        Additionally, step 608 may include applying an electrical
        potential to the object. Applying an electrical potential to the
        object may affect the flame or the combustion gas produced by
        the flame with the inertial electrode. This may preferentially
        transfer heat to the object and may include imparting
        electrically charged particles onto the flame or the combustion
        gas produced by the flame such that the electrically charged
        particles and heat from the flame or the combustion gas produced
        by the flame may be electrically attracted to the electrical
        potential applied to the object. Alternatively (or
        intermittently), the inertial electrode may be operative to
        protect the object from heat. For example, the inertial
        electrode may impart electrically charged particles onto the
        flame or the combustion gas such that the electrically charged
        particles and heat from the flame or the combustion gas are
        electrically repelled from the electrical potential applied to
        the object.<br>
        <br>
        Proceeding to step 610, heat from the flame or from the
        combustion gas may be supplied to an object. In step 610 an
        object may additionally or alternatively be protected from heat
        from the flame or the combustion gas. For example, heat from the
        flame may be supplied to an electrical power generator, a
        turbine, a chemical process plant, a boiler, a water heater, a
        furnace, a land vehicle, a ship, or an aircraft. Protection from
        heat may be enabled for purposes of throttling an effect, for
        shutting down a process, or for protecting the object from
        overheating.<br>
        <br>
        Optionally, the method for operating a burner system 601 may
        include applying an electrical potential to a second object (not
        shown) spaced away from the object. In step 608 affecting the
        flame or the combustion gas produced by the flame with the
        inertial electrode to protect the object from heat from the
        flame or the combustion gas may be performed by selecting a sign
        for the electrically charged particles and therefore the heat
        from the flame or the combustion gas to be electrically
        attracted to the electrical potential applied to the second
        object spaced away from the object protected from the heat.<br>
        <br>
        Optionally, the inertial electrode launcher may be protected
        from exposure to a fluid flow past the flame. Affecting the
        flame or combustion gas produced by the flame in step 608 may
        include providing flame holding with the inertial electrode. For
        example, protecting the inertial electrode launcher from
        exposure to the fluid flow past the flame may include
        positioning the inertial flame holder and/or at least a portion
        of the inertial electrode in the lee of a physical fluid flow
        barrier.<br>
        <br>
        Step 608, affecting a shape or location of the flame with the
        inertial electrode may include affecting a concentration of the
        charged particles in the flame. Additionally, step 608 may
        include reacting at least a portion of the inertial electrode
        with the flame or the combustion gas. In some embodiments, the
        burner may be held or driven to a voltage such as ground.
        Interactions between the flame and the inertial electrode may be
        based on differences between a majority charge or voltage
        carried by the inertial electrode and the balanced charge or
        (e.g., ground) voltage carried by the flame.<br>
        <br>
        As described above, various forms of inertial electrodes are
        contemplated. In step 606, launching the inertial electrode may
        include launching a second flame comprising an inertial
        electrode (e.g., see FIG. 2). This may cause the second flame to
        carry an inertial electrode majority charge or inertial
        electrode voltage.<br>
        <br>
        Alternatively, as illustrated in FIG. 3, launching the inertial
        electrode in step 606 may include vaporizing a liquid or other
        vaporizing material with high voltage. Vaporization may be
        performed by applying a biased voltage through the vaporizing
        material between electrodes. The vaporization may project a
        vapor or aerosol carrying charges corresponding to the voltage
        bias.<br>
        <br>
        Alternatively, step 606 may include propelling charged solid
        particles, as shown in FIG. 4. The charged solid particles may
        carry a majority charge and may collectively form the inertial
        electrode. The solid particles may be entrained in a fluid
        stream. A majority charge may be deposited on the entrained
        solid particles, for example by passing the particles along or
        past a corona emission source such as a simple corona wire,
        corotron, or scorotron. The solid particles may include coal,
        coke, and/or carbon; and/or may include another material such as
        a salt selected to react with the flame and/or with a combustion
        byproduct.<br>
        <br>
        Alternatively, launching an inertial electrode may include
        energizing a nozzle with an inertial electrode voltage and
        projecting a liquid from the nozzle. This approach is
        illustrated in FIG. 5, above. The liquid may include water, a
        buffered solution, a slurry, a gel, a fuel, and/or another
        material capable of flowing through the nozzle.<br>
        <br>
        Optionally, the method 601 may include selecting or varying a
        direction of launch of the inertial electrode with an actuator
        (not shown). Additionally or alternatively, the method 601 may
        include selecting or actuating a timing, volume, flow duration,
        charge or voltage sign, or charge density of the inertial
        electrode.<br>
