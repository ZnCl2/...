      [0001] The present application claims priority benefit under 35
      USC §119(e) to U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61/294,761;
      entitled “METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR ELECTRICALLY ACTIVATED HEAT
      TRANSFER”, invented by David Goodson, Thomas S. Hartwick, and
      Christopher A. Wiklof, filed on Jan. 13, 2010, which is currently
      co-pending herewith, and which, to the extent not inconsistent
      with the disclosure herein, incorporated by reference.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0002] Typical external combustion systems such as combustors and
      boilers may include relatively complicated systems to maximize the
      extraction of heat from a heated gas stream. Generally, such
      systems may rely on forced or natural convection to transfer heat
      from the heated gas stream through heat transfer surfaces to heat
      sinks.<br>
      <br>
      [0003] Other systems, which may include the combustion systems
      indicated above, or may include other systems such as turbo-jet
      engines, ram- or scram-jet engines, and rocket engines, for
      example, are limited with respect to combustion temperature or
      reliability due to erosion of critical parts by hot gases. It
      would be desirable to reduce heat transfer to
      temperature-sensitive surfaces of such systems.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0004] According to an embodiment, a system for electrically
      stimulated heat transfer may include at least one first electrode
      positioned adjacent to a heated gas stream, and at least one heat
      transfer surface positioned near the at least one electrode. The
      heated gas stream may include positively and/or negatively charged
      species evolved from a combustion reaction. At least one first
      electrode may be electrically modulated to attract the positively
      and/or negatively charged species toward the at least one heat
      transfer surface. The attracted charged species may entrain
      heat-bearing non-charged species. The flow of heat-bearing charged
      and non-charged species may responsively flow near the at least
      one heat transfer surface and transfer heat energy from the heated
      gas stream to a heat sink corresponding to the at least one heat
      transfer surface.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] According to another embodiment, at least one second
      electrode may selectively remove one or more charged species from
      the heated gas stream. The heated gas stream may thus exhibit a
      charge imbalance that may be maintained as the heated gas stream
      flows in the vicinity of the at least one first electrode.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] According to another embodiment a heat transfer surface may
      include an integrated electrode configured for electrostatic
      attraction of charged species in a heated gas stream. The
      attracted charged species may entrain heated non-charged species.
      The integrated electrode may be electrically isolated from the
      heat transfer surface.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] According to another embodiment, a method for stimulating
      heat transfer may include providing a heated gas carrying
      electrically charged species, modulating a first electrode to
      drive the heated gas to flow adjacent to a heat transfer surface,
      and transferring heat from the gas to the heat transfer surface.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] According to another embodiment, a method for protecting a
      temperature-sensitive surface may include providing a heated gas
      carrying electrically charged species and modulating a first
      electrode to drive the heated gas to flow distal from a
      temperature-sensitive surface to reduce the transfer of heat from
      the gas to the temperature-sensitive surface.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] According to another embodiment, an apparatus for reducing
      heat transfer from a combustion reaction may include a
      temperature-sensitive surface positioned in a hot gas stream
      including electrically charged species from a combustion reaction
      and a first electrode configured to be modulated to drive the
      electrically charged species from the combustion reaction to a
      location away from the temperature-sensitive surface.<br>

      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b>[0018] In the following detailed description, reference is
      made to the accompanying drawings, which form a part hereof. In
      the drawings, similar symbols typically identify similar
      components, unless context dictates otherwise. The illustrative
      embodiments described in the detailed description, drawings, and
      claims are not meant to be limiting. Other embodiments may be
      utilized, and other changes may be made, without departing from
      the spirit or scope of the subject matter presented here.<br>
      <br>
      [0019] FIG. 1 is a diagram of a system 101 configured to stimulate
      heat transfer to a heat transfer surface 114 using an electric
      field, according to an embodiment. The system 101 may typically
      include a flame 102 supported by a burner assembly 103. A
      combustion reaction in the flame 102 generates a heated gas 104
      (having a flow illustrated by the arrow 105) carrying electrically
      charged species 106, 108. Typically, the electrically charged
      species include positively charged species 106 and negatively
      charged species 108.<br>
      <br>
      [0020] Providing a heated gas carrying charged species 106, 108
      may include burning at least one fuel from a fuel source 118, the
      combustion reaction providing at least a portion of the charged
      species and combustion gasses. According to some embodiments, the
      combustion reaction may provide substantially all the charged
      species 106, 108.<br>
      <br>
      [0021] The charged species 106, 108 may include unburned fuel;
      intermediate radicals such as hydride, hydroperoxide, and hydroxyl
      radicals; particulates and other ash; pyrolysis products; charged
      gas molecules; and free electrons, for example. At various stages
      of combustion, the mix of charged species 106, 108 may vary. As
      will be discussed below, some embodiments may remove a portion of
      the charged species 106 or 108 in a first portion of the heated
      gas 104, leaving a charge imbalance in another portion of the
      heated gas 104.<br>
      <br>
      [0022] For example, one embodiment may remove a portion of
      negative species 108 including substantially only electrons,
      leaving a positive charge imbalance in the gas stream 104.
      Positive species 106 and remaining negative species 108 may then
      be electrostatically attracted to the vicinity of a heat sink 116,
      resulting in a stimulation of heat transfer. Alternatively, a
      portion of positive species 106 may be removed from the heated gas
      stream 104, leaving a negative charge imbalance in the gas stream.<br>
      <br>
      [0023] A first electrode 110 may be voltage modulated by a voltage
      source 112. The voltage modulation may be configured to attract a
      portion of the charged species 106, here illustrated as positive.
      Modulating the first electrode may include driving the first
      electrode to one or more voltages selected to attract oppositely
      charged species, and the attracted oppositely charged species
      imparting momentum transfer to the heated gas.<br>
      <br>
      [0024] The momentum transfer from the electrically driven charged
      species 106 may be regarded as entraining non-charged particles,
      unburned fuel, ash, etc. carrying heat. The modulated first
      electrode 110 may be configured to attract the charged species and
      other entrained species carrying heat to preferentially flow
      adjacent to a heat transfer surface 114. As the heat-carrying
      species flow adjacent to the heat transfer surface 114, a portion
      of the heat carried by the species is transferred through the heat
      transfer surface 114 to a heat sink 116.<br>
      <br>
      [0025] According to an embodiment, the first electrode 110 may be
      arranged near the heat transfer surface 114. A nominal mass flow
      105 may be characterized by a velocity (including speed and
      direction). The first electrode 110 may be configured to impart a
      drift velocity to the charged species 106 at an angle to the
      nominal mass flow velocity 105 and toward the heat transfer
      surface 114.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] As mentioned above, the system 101 may further modulate at
      least one second electrode 120 to remove a portion of the charged
      species 106, 108. According to an embodiment, the second electrode
      120 may preferentially purge negatively-charged species 108 from
      the heated gas 104. According to an embodiment, the second
      electrode may preferentially purge a portion of electrons 108 from
      the heated gas 104.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] According to an embodiment, the at least one second
      electrode 120 includes a burner assembly 103 that supports a flame
      102, the flame 102 providing a locus for the combustion reaction.
      The second electrode 120 may be driven with a waveform from the
      voltage source 112. Alternatively, the second electrode may be
      driven from another voltage source.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] While the flame 102 is illustrated in a shape typical of a
      diffusion flame, other combustion reaction distributions may be
      provided, depending upon a given embodiment.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] FIG. 2 is a diagram of a system 201 having alternative
      electrode arrangement compared to the system 101 of FIG. 1,
      according to an embodiment. The system 201 may include a first
      electrode 110 that is integrated with the heat transfer surface
      114. The system 201 may additionally or alternatively include an
      optional second electrode 120 that is separate from the burner
      assembly 103. As with the system 101 of FIG. 1, the burner
      assembly 103 is configured to support a flame 102 that provides a
      locus for combustion and generation of at least a portion of the
      charged particles 106, 108 carried in the heated gas 104.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] A heat sink 116 may be positioned in the heated gas stream
      104 as illustrated. As the heated gas stream flows past the heat
      sink 116, the flow may split, as illustrated by the arrows 105.
      According to an embodiment, at least one electrode 110, here
      illustrated as being integrated with the heat transfer surface 114
      adjoining the heat sink 116, may be modulated to electrostatically
      attract charged species 106 and/or 108. As may be appreciated,
      such attraction may tend to move the charged species 106, 108
      along paths at angles to the mean gas flow velocity 105.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] One possible outcome of carrying positive 106 and negative
      108 species through the entirety of the heated gas stream 104 is
      recombination, whereby a positive charge 106 combines with a
      negative charge 108 to produce one or more neutral species (not
      shown). Such recombination may reduce the coupling efficiency
      between the first electrode 110 and the heated gas 104 by reducing
      the concentration of charged species 106 responsive to a voltage
      on the first electrode 110.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] As with the description corresponding to FIG. 1, the
      placement of a positive species attractive electrode (e.g. the
      first electrode 110) and negative species attractive electrode
      (e.g. the second electrode 120) represents an embodiment. Other
      embodiments may reverse the relationship and/or otherwise modify
      the embodiment of FIG. 2 without departing from the spirit or
      scope of this description.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] According to the embodiment 201, the at least one second
      electrode 120 includes an electrode positioned at a location
      nearer the burner assembly 103 than the distance between the
      burner assembly 103 and the heat transfer surface 114. For
      example, the at least one second electrode 120 may be positioned
      and driven to sweep electrons 108 out of the flow of the heated
      gas 104. The modulation of the at least one second electrode 120
      may include providing an alternating voltage. The voltage to which
      the voltage driver 112 drives the second electrode 120 may attract
      the electrons 108 to the surface of the second electrode 120. The
      electrons 108 may combine with a positively charged conductor
      including the at least one second electrode 120 and thus be
      removed from the heated gas stream 104.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] While the open cylindrical or toric shape of the second
      electrode 120 represents one embodiment, alternative shapes may be
      appropriate for alternative embodiments.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] In the embodiment 201, the heat transfer surface 114
      includes the first electrode 110. FIG. 3 is a partial cross
      section of an apparatus 301 including an integrated electrode 110
      and heat transfer surface 114 corresponding to FIG. 2, according
      to an embodiment.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] According to an embodiment, the integrated apparatus 301
      may form at least a portion of a wall of a fire tube or water tube
      boiler, for example. For example, the heat transfer surface 114
      may include a tube or pipe wall that includes an opposing surface
      302 abutting a heat sink 116. The heat sink 116 may include a
      flowing liquid, vapor, and/or steam. Alternatively, the heat
      transfer surface may separate a heated gas stream 104 from a
      convective or forced air heat sink 116, such as in an air-to-air
      heat exchanger. According to another embodiment, the heat sink 116
      may represent a solid heat conductor, a heat pipe, or other
      apparatus that is configured to be heated by the heated gas 104.
      According to some embodiments, the heat transfer surface may
      include the surface of a heat sink 116 that is substantially solid
      of a heat conductor, and there may be substantially no opposite
      wall 302. In some embodiments, such as in the case of a fire tube
      boiler embodiment for example, the radius depicted in FIG. 3 may
      be flattened or reversed.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] According to some embodiments, it may be desirable to
      provide an apparatus 301 including an integrated electrode 110 and
      heat transfer surface 114 wherein the electrode 110 is
      electrically isolated from the heat transfer surface 114. The
      embodiment 301 may include a thermally conductive wall extending
      from the heat transfer surface 114. The thermally conductive wall
      may extend to an opposite surface 302 or may extend to an
      extension of the heat transfer surface 114 (such as in a
      cylindrical heat sink 116) or may extend to an opposite surface
      that is discontinuous from the heat transfer surface 114, but
      which is adiabatic.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] An electrical insulator 304 may be disposed over at least a
      portion of the thermally conductive wall extending from the heat
      transfer surface 114. The first electrode 110 may include an
      electrically conductive layer disposed over at least a portion of
      the electrical insulator 304.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] Various electrical insulators 302 may be used. According to
      embodiments, the electrical insulator 302 may be selected for a
      relatively high dielectric constant (at least at a modulation
      frequency of the first electrode 110), a melting point or glass
      transition temperature high enough to avoid degradation, a
      relatively high thermal conductivity, a relatively low coefficient
      of thermal expansion, and/or a coefficient of thermal expansion
      that is relatively well-matched to that of the material in the
      wall extending from the heat transfer surface 114 and/or the
      electrode layer 110. For example, the electrical insulator 304 may
      include one or more of polyether-ether-ketone, polyimide, silicon
      dioxide, silica glass, alumina, silicon, titanium dioxide,
      strontium titanate, barium strontium titanate, or barium titanate.
      Lower dielectric materials such as polyimide,
      polyether-ether-ketone, silicon dioxide, silica glass, or silicon
      may be most appropriate for the insulation layer for embodiments
      using lower voltages and/or greater insulator thicknesses.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] According to embodiments, the conductive layer of the
      electrode 110 may be selected to have relatively high conductivity
      and relatively high melting point. For example, the first
      electrode 110 may include one or more of graphite, chromium, an
      alloy including chromium, an alloy including molybdenum, tungsten,
      an alloy including tungsten, tantalum, an alloy including
      tantalum, or niobium-doped strontium titanate.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] According to some embodiments, the at least one electrode
      110 may include a portion that is deposited prior to operation,
      e.g. a metal, crystal, or graphite, and a portion that is
      deposited during operation, for example carbon particles such as
      conductive soot or conductive ash. A useful dynamic may occur when
      a portion of the conductivity of the at least one electrode 110
      accrues from a deposit formed during operation. Electrodes or
      electrode regions that exhibit increased coupling efficiency, for
      example owing to system geometry, power output, stoichiometry,
      and/or fuel flow/heated air flow rate, may tend to attract a
      relatively greater particle impingement. The relatively greater
      particle impingement may tend to erode or displace the deposited
      matter. The removal of the deposited matter that forms a portion
      of the electrode may result in a decrease in coupling efficiency
      to the heated gas 104. The resultant decrease in coupling
      efficiency may reduce the amount of particle impingement, and
      hence erosion. According to an embodiment, these effects may help
      to provide a pseudo-equilibrium that may equalize “pull” on
      charged particles across the extent of an electrode or across an
      array of electrodes.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] Referring back to FIGS. 1 and 2, the voltage source 112 may
      be configured to drive the at least one first electrode 110, and
      optionally at least one second electrode 120 with electrical
      waveforms. As indicated above, modulating the at least one first
      electrode 110 may include driving the first electrode 110 to one
      or more voltages selected to attract oppositely charged species
      106, 108, and the attracted oppositely charged species may then
      impart momentum transfer to the heated gas. An optional at least
      one second electrode 120 may be driven with a waveform selected to
      at least partially sweep some of the charged species 106, 108,
      such as electrons 108, out of the flow of the heated gas 104. The
      electrical waveforms that drive the at least one first electrode
      110 and the optional at least one second electrode 120 may include
      a dc voltage waveform, an ac voltage waveform, an ac voltage with
      dc bias, non-periodic fluctuating waveforms, and/or combinations
      thereof.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] FIG. 4 is a waveform diagram 401 showing illustrative
      waveforms for driving electrodes 110, 120 of FIGS. 1-3, according
      to an embodiment. The waveform 402 depicts an illustrative
      approach to driving the at least one first electrode 110. For
      multiple electrode 110 systems, a common waveform 402 may drive
      all the electrodes 110. Alternatively, one or more of the multiple
      electrodes 110 may be driven by a waveform 402 different from
      other waveforms 402 used to drive the other multiple electrodes
      110.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] According to an embodiment, the waveform 402 may modulate
      between a high voltage VH and a low voltage VL in a pattern
      characterized by a period P1. The high voltage VH and low voltage
      VL may be selected as equal magnitude variations above and below a
      mean voltage V01. The mean voltage V01 may be a ground voltage or
      may be a constant or variable voltage V01 representing a dc bias
      from ground. The absolute value |VH-V01|=|VL-V01| may be greater
      than, less than, or about equal to the absolute value |V01|. In
      other words, the high voltage VH may be above, about equal to, or
      below ground, depending on the embodiment. Similarly, the low
      voltage VL may be above, about equal to, or below ground,
      depending on the embodiment.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] The period P1 includes a duration tL corresponding to the
      low voltage VL and another duration tH corresponding to the high
      voltage VH. According to some embodiments tL+tH=P1. According to
      other embodiments (not shown), the period may include a portion of
      time during which the voltage may be held at the mean voltage V01,
      to yield tL+tH&lt;P1. For embodiments where VL is below ground, a
      positive species duty cycle D+ may be defined as D+=tL/(tL+tH).
      Similarly, for embodiments where VH is above ground, a negative
      species duty cycle D- may be defined as D-=tH/(tL+tH). For a
      single electrode 110, the positive species duty cycle D+ and the
      negative species duty cycle D- are not linearly independent.
      However, linearly independent positive species and negative
      species duty cycles, D+, D- may be provided by spatially separated
      electrodes 110.<br>
      <br>
      [0046] For the embodiments 110, 210 illustrated in FIGS. 1 and 2,
      and assuming constant VL&lt;0 and constant VH&gt;0, effects of a
      waveform 402 will be described. During period P1 portions tL, the
      electrode 110 provides an electrostatic attraction to positive
      species 106 in the heated gas stream 104 and imparts a drift
      velocity on the positive species 106 toward the electrode 110. The
      drift velocity may be at an angle to the mass flow velocity 105
      when the electrode 110 is positioned lateral to the mass flow
      velocity 105. During portions tL, the electrode 110 may tend to
      repel negative species 108 entrained within the heated gas stream
      104.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] During period P1 portions tH, the electrode 110 provides an
      electrostatic attraction to negative species 108 in the heated gas
      stream 104 and imparts a drift velocity on the negative species
      108 toward the electrode 110. The drift velocity may be at an
      angle to the mass flow velocity 105 when the electrode 110 is
      positioned lateral to the mass flow velocity 105. During portions
      tH, the electrode 110 may tend to repel positive species 106
      entrained within the heated gas stream 104.<br>
      <br>
      [0048] For a substantially constant VL, a larger positive species
      duty cycle D+ provides a greater amount of positive species 106
      attraction and a lower positive species duty cycle D+ provides a
      lesser amount of positive species 106 attraction. The positive
      species duty cycle D+provided by the voltage source 112 may be
      varied according to the amount of drift momentum desired to be
      impressed upon the heated gas stream 104. For example, at a higher
      flow rate 105, a higher positive species duty cycle D+ may be
      useful for maximizing positive species 106 flux, and hence
      maximizing heat extraction from the heated gas 104.<br>
      <br>
      [0049] Similarly, for a substantially constant VH, a larger
      negative species duty cycle D- provides a greater amount of
      negative species 108 attraction, and a lower negative species duty
      cycle D- provides a lesser amount of negative species 108
      attraction. The negative species duty cycle D- provided by the
      voltage source 112 may be varied according to the amount of drift
      momentum desired to be impressed upon the heated gas stream 104.
      For example, at a higher flow rate 105, a higher negative species
      duty cycle D- may be useful for maximizing negative species 108
      flux, hence maximizing heat extraction from the heated gas 104.<br>
      <br>
      [0050] The period P1 may be selected according to a range of
      considerations. For example, the concentration of positive and/or
      negative species 106, 108 in the heated gas stream may at least
      partly determine an effective impedance and/or conductivity
      related to an effective relative dielectric constant, which may,
      in turn, affect a frequency-dependence of the electrostatic
      coupling efficiency to the heated gas 104. According to another
      example, the mass/charge ratio of the positive and/or negative
      species may affect their frequency dependent momentum response to
      the waveform 402. Other things being equal, larger period P1 may
      provide higher electrostatic coupling efficiency to more massive
      species 106, 108. A shorter period P1, on the other hand, may be
      advantageous for avoiding arcing, especially when voltages VH
      and/or VL have large absolute magnitudes relative to grounded
      surfaces abutting the heated gas 104.<br>
      <br>
      [0051] Depending on the mix of positive species 106 and negative
      species 108 in the vicinity of the at least one electrode 110 and
      the heat transfer surface 114, one or the other of the positive
      species duty cycle D+ or the negative species duty cycle D- may be
      of greater importance for increasing the heat flux to the heat
      transfer surface 114. As described above, at least one second
      electrode 120, which may be positioned nearer the burner assembly
      103 and combustion locus 102 than the at least one first electrode
      110, may be used to purge a portion of charged species 106 or 108
      from the heated gas 104. Purging a portion of the charged species
      106 or 108 from the heated gas 104 may tend to reduce charge
      recombination and corresponding reduction in charged species 106
      or 108 present while the heated gas traverses a region in the
      vicinity of the at least one first electrode 110 and heat transfer
      surface 114. Additionally, purging a portion of charged species
      106 or 108 may result in a charge imbalance in the vicinity of the
      at least one electrode 110 and the heat transfer surface 114. The
      charge imbalance may be used to advantage by preferentially
      attracting the higher concentration species.<br>
      <br>
      [0052] For example, electrons 108 may be swept out of the heated
      gas 104 by at least one second electrode 120. Returning again to
      FIG. 4, waveform 404 illustrates a waveform that may be provided
      by the voltage source 112 to the at least one second electrode 120
      to sweep one or more charged species out of the heated air column
      104. For example, the at least one second electrode may sweep
      electrons out of the gas stream 104, resulting in a positive
      charge imbalance in the vicinity of the at least one first
      electrode 110 and the heat transfer surface 114. The electrons may
      combine with a positively charged conductor including the at least
      one second electrode 120 and thereafter be conducted away to the
      voltage source 112.<br>
      <br>
      [0053] According to an embodiment, the waveform 404 may modulate
      between a high voltage VH2 and a low voltage VL2 in a pattern
      characterized by a period P2. The high voltage VH2 and low voltage
      VL2 may be selected as equal magnitude variations above and below
      a mean voltage V02. The mean voltage V02 may be a ground voltage
      or may be a constant or variable voltage V02 representing a dc
      bias from ground. The absolute value |VH2-V02|=|VL2-V02| may be
      greater than, less than, or about equal to the absolute value
      |V02|. In other words, the high voltage VH2 may be above, about
      equal to, or below ground, depending on the embodiment. Similarly,
      the low voltage VL2 may be above, about equal to, or below ground,
      depending on the embodiment.<br>
      <br>
      [0054] The period P2 includes a duration tL2 corresponding to the
      low voltage VL2 and another duration tH2 corresponding to the high
      voltage VH2. According to some embodiments tL2+tH2=P2. According
      to other embodiments (not shown), the period may include a portion
      of time during which the voltage may be held at the mean voltage
      V02, to yield tL2+tH2&lt;P2. For embodiments where VL2 is below
      ground, a positive species duty cycle D+2 may be defined as
      D+2=tL2/(tL2+tH2). Similarly, for embodiments where VH2 is above
      ground, a negative species duty cycle D-2 may be defined as
      D-2=tH2/(tL2+tH2). For a single electrode 120, the positive
      species duty cycle D+2 and the negative species duty cycle D-2 are
      not linearly independent. However, linearly independent positive
      species and negative species duty cycles, D+2, D-2 may be provided
      by spatially separated electrodes 120.<br>
      <br>
      [0055] For the embodiments 110, 210 illustrated in FIGS. 1 and 2,
      and assuming constant VL2&lt;0 and constant VH2&gt;0, effects of a
      waveform 404 will be described. During period P2 portions tL2, the
      electrode 120 provides an electrostatic attraction to positive
      species 106 in the heated gas stream 104 and imparts a drift
      velocity on the positive species 106 toward the electrode 120. The
      drift velocity may be at an angle to the mass flow velocity 105
      when the electrode 120 is positioned lateral to the mass flow
      velocity 105. During portions tL2, the electrode 120 may tend to
      repel negative species 108 entrained within the heated gas stream
      104.<br>
      <br>
      [0056] During period P2 portions tH2, the electrode 120 provides
      an electrostatic attraction to negative species 108 in the heated
      gas stream 104 and imparts a drift velocity on the negative
      species 108 toward the electrode 120. The drift velocity may be at
      an angle to the mass flow velocity 105 when the electrode 120 is
      positioned lateral to the mass flow velocity 105. During portions
      tH2, the electrode 120 may tend to repel positive species 106
      entrained within the heated gas stream 104.<br>
      <br>
      [0057] For a substantially constant VL2, a larger positive species
      duty cycle D+2 provides a greater amount of positive species 106
      attraction and a lower positive species duty cycle D+2 provides a
      lesser amount of positive species 106 attraction. The positive
      species duty cycle D+2 provided by the voltage source 112 may be
      varied according to the amount of positive species 106 desired to
      be removed from the heated gas stream 104. For example, at a
      higher flow rate 105, a higher positive species duty cycle D+2 may
      be useful for maximizing positive species 106 flux, and hence
      maximizing the withdrawal of positive species from the heated gas
      104.<br>
      <br>
      [0058] Similarly, for a substantially constant VH2, a larger
      negative species duty cycle D-2 provides a greater amount of
      negative species 108 attraction, and a lower negative species duty
      cycle D-2 provides a lesser amount of negative species 108
      attraction. The negative species duty cycle D-2 provided by the
      voltage source 112 may be varied according to the amount of
      negative species to be removed from the heated gas stream 104. For
      example, at a higher flow rate 105, a higher negative species duty
      cycle D-2 may be useful for maximizing negative species 108 flux,
      hence maximizing negative species extraction from the heated gas
      104.<br>
      <br>
      [0059] The period P2 may be selected according to a range of
      considerations. For example, the concentration of positive and/or
      negative species 106, 108 in the heated gas stream may at least
      partly determine an effective impedance and/or conductivity
      related to an effective relative dielectric constant, which may,
      in turn, affect a frequency-dependence of the electrostatic
      coupling efficiency to the heated gas 104. According to another
      example, the mass/charge ratio of the positive and/or negative
      species may affect their frequency dependent momentum response to
      the waveform 404. Other things being equal, larger period P2 may
      provide higher electrostatic coupling efficiency to more massive
      species 106, 108. A shorter period P2, on the other hand, may be
      advantageous for avoiding arcing or avoiding the undesirable
      removal of move massive charged species 106, 108, especially when
      voltages VH2 and/or VL2 have large absolute magnitudes relative to
      grounded surfaces abutting the heated gas 104.<br>
      <br>
      [0060] According to an illustrative embodiment, at least one
      second electrode 120 may be configured to sweep a portion of
      electrons from the heated gas 104, but avoid sweeping other
      negative species from the heated gas 104. For example, the period
      P2 of the second electrode modulation may be selected to impart
      sufficient momentum on electrons to withdraw a portion of the free
      electrons. More massive negative particles respond (accelerate)
      more slowly to the force imparted by the electrical field because
      of the inverse mass relationship between force and acceleration.
      Hence, a relatively short period P2 may result in an acceleration
      of electrons to the surface of the second electrode, but leave
      more massive negative species in the heated gas 104.<br>
      <br>
      [0061] At least one first electrode 110 may be configured to
      primarily drive remaining and relatively massive positive species
      including unburned fuel and ash toward a heat transfer surface
      114. For example, for a system including a 7.6 cm diameter tube
      enclosing the heated volume and a heated gas 104 velocity of about
      90 cm/second, the at least one first electrode 110 may be
      modulated between about 0 volts and -10,000 volts at a frequency
      of about 300 Hz at a 97% duty cycle. This results in the at least
      one first electrode 110 being periodically modulated to -10 kV for
      3.22 milliseconds and then to 0V for 0.1 milliseconds, for a total
      period of 3.32 milliseconds (301.2 Hz).<br>
      <br>
      [0062] According to an embodiment, the at least one first
      electrode 110 may produce an electric field strength of about 1
      kV/cm. Because of the large number of collisions between species
      in the heated gas 104, acceleration may be ignored and moderate
      mass positively charged species 106 (e.g. CO&lt;+&gt;,
      C3H8&lt;+&gt;, etc.) in the stream (along with entrained gas and
      particles) may be approximated to be imparted with a nominal drift
      velocity toward the first electrode 110 (and hence the heat
      transfer surface 114) of about 1000 cm/second. In comparison to an
      embodiment having a typical gas flow rate of about 100 cm/second,
      one may appreciate that driving the at least one first electrode
      110 may significantly affect the transfer of heat through the heat
      transfer surface 114.<br>
      <br>
      [0063] At least one second electrode 120 may be configured to
      primarily drive electrons out of the heated gas 104. For example
      for a system using a burner nozzle as the second electrode 120
      centered in a 7.6 cm diameter tube and a heated gas velocity of
      about 90 cm/second, the second electrode 120 may be modulated
      between about 0 volts and +10,000 volts at a frequency of about
      300 Hz at a 97% duty cycle. This results in the at least one
      second electrode 120 being periodically modulated to +10 kV for
      3.22 milliseconds and then to 0V for 0.1 milliseconds, for a total
      period of 3.32 milliseconds (301.2 Hz). Another second electrode
      120 modulation schema may provide 50% duty cycle modulation
      between 0V and +10,300V at a frequency of 694.4 kHz.<br>
      <br>
      [0064] According to an embodiment, the at least one second
      electrode 120 may produce an electric field strength of about 1
      kV/cm. Because of the large number of collisions between species
      in the heated gas 104, acceleration may be ignored and low mass
      negatively charged species 106 (e.g. e&lt;-&gt;) in the stream may
      be approximated to be imparted with a nominal drift velocity
      toward the second electrode 120 of about 10&lt;5 &gt;cm/second,
      which is more than sufficient to overcome an illustrative gas flow
      rate of 100 cm/sec. However, because of the low mass of electrons,
      relatively little momentum is transferred to other species in the
      heated gas 104, thus avoiding entrainment, and significant flow of
      heat to the second electrode 120 may be avoided.<br>
      <br>
      [0065] FIG. 5 is a diagram of a system 501 configured with a
      plurality of first electrodes 110a, 110b and heat transfer
      surfaces 114a, 114b, 114c, according to an embodiment. The
      plurality of first electrodes 110a-b and heat transfer surfaces
      114a-c may be arranged to respectively drive and receive heat
      transfer from a heated gas stream 104 generated by at least one
      combustion locus or flame 102 supported by at least one burner
      assembly 103. The at least one combustion reaction supported by
      the at least one burner assembly 103 may evolve positively charged
      species 106 and negatively charged species 108 into the heated gas
      stream 104.<br>
      <br>
      [0066] The plurality of first electrodes may be driven with a
      common waveform from a voltage source 112 or with separate
      waveforms. The plurality of first electrodes 110a, 110b may be
      configured to impart drift velocities to the positively charged
      species 106 and/or the negatively charged species 108 at a
      plurality of angles to a nominal mass flow velocity 105. A heat
      transfer surface may include a plurality of heat transfer surfaces
      114a-c. The plurality of heat transfer surfaces 114a-c may
      correspond to a common heat sink or to a corresponding plurality
      of heat sinks 116a-c.<br>
      <br>
      [0067] For example, a common heat sink 116a may correspond to a
      water tube in a boiler. The water tube may, for example, include
      an electrically insulating layer (not shown) formed over
      substantially the entirety of the water tube. A plurality of
      electrodes 110a-b may be formed as patterned conductors over the
      insulating layer (not shown) on the water tube 116a. The plurality
      of heat transfer surfaces 114a-c may correspond to regions between
      the patterned electrodes 110a-b.<br>
      <br>
      [0068] According to an alternative embodiment, the plurality of
      heat transfer surfaces 114a-c may correspond to a plurality of
      heat sinks 116a-c. For example, at least a portion of the
      plurality of first electrodes 110a, 110b may be interdigitated
      with at least a portion of the plurality of heat transfer surfaces
      114a-c. The heat sinks 116a-c and heat transfer surfaces 114a-c
      may optionally be electrically conductive. The plurality of first
      electrodes 110a-b may be separated from the heat transfer surfaces
      114a-c by air gaps. The air gaps may insulate the plurality of
      first electrodes 110a-b from the plurality of heat transfer
      surfaces 114a-c and/or the plurality of heat sinks 116a-c.<br>
      <br>
      [0069] A plurality of heat transfer surfaces 114a-c and
      corresponding plurality of heat sinks 116a-c may form a heat sink
      array 502. A system 501 may include a plurality of heat sink
      arrays 502, 502b, 502c. The heat sink arrays 502, 502b, 502c may
      include electrodes driven by a common voltage source 112, or by a
      corresponding plurality of voltage sources (not shown).<br>
      <br>
      [0070] FIG. 6 is a close-up sectional view 601 of heat transfer
      surfaces 114a, 114b illustrating an effect of impinging charged
      species 106, 108 (and any entrained non-charged species) on
      boundary layers 602a, 602b, according to an embodiment. A heated
      gas stream 104 includes a bulk flow velocity 105. Heat transfer
      surfaces 114a, 114b may be disposed adjacent to the heated gas
      stream 104.<br>
      <br>
      [0071] A first heat transfer surface 114a, may not include a
      corresponding electrode, or may represent a moment during which a
      corresponding electrode is not modulated to attract a charged
      species. A boundary layer 602a lies over the heat transfer surface
      114a. The boundary layer 602a may represent a thickness of
      relatively quiescent air across which thermal diffusion and/or
      radiation may dominate as heat transfer mechanisms over convective
      heat transfer. Even in cases where the heated air stream 104 as a
      whole is moving with sufficient velocity 105 to provide convective
      heat transfer, for example as turbulent flow, the boundary layer
      602a may be present. In cases where the heated air average
      velocity 105 is high enough to reach a Reynolds number
      characteristic of turbulent flow, the boundary layer 602a may be
      characterized as a turbulent boundary layer.<br>
      <br>
      [0072] Convective heat transfer and/or heat transfer between
      regions outside the boundary layer 602a is characterized by a
      higher heat transfer coefficient than heat transfer across the
      boundary layer 602a. The thickness of the boundary layer 602a may
      be proportional to its resistance to heat transfer from the heated
      air stream 104 to the heat transfer surface 114a.<br>
      <br>
      [0073] A second heat transfer surface 114b includes a
      corresponding electrode 110b that is modulated or energized to
      attract charged species 106 from the heated air stream 104. The
      corresponding electrode 110b may, for example, include a
      conduction path within a conductive wall defined at least
      partially by the heat transfer surface 114b. This may be
      particularly appropriate when the wall is electrically isolated
      and lies adjacent a substantially non-conductive heat sink, as in
      an air-to-air heat exchanger for example. Alternatively, the
      corresponding electrode 110b may overlie the heat transfer surface
      114b, for example according to an embodiment corresponding to that
      of FIG. 3. Alternatively, the corresponding electrode 110b may be
      disposed near the heat transfer surface 114b. As will be
      appreciated, while an electrode 110b disposed near the heat
      transfer surface 114b may not drive the charged species 106 to
      accelerate toward the heat transfer surface, it may impart
      sufficient momentum to the charged species 106 (and any
      non-charged or oppositely-charged species entrained therewith) to
      cause them to impinge upon the heat transfer surface 114b as shown
      diagrammatically.<br>
      <br>
      [0074] Charged species 106 that impinge upon the heat transfer
      surface 114b may do so by penetrating a boundary layer 602b. The
      penetration of the charged species 106 may cause the boundary
      layer 602b to be thinner than the boundary layer 602a. The
      penetration of the charged species 106 may also effectively raise
      the Reynolds number sufficiently to substantially convert a
      laminar boundary layer 602a to a turbulent boundary layer 602b.
      The mixing or disruption of the boundary layer 602b by the
      impinging charged species, any entrained non-charged species, and
      any entrained oppositely-charged species may result in raising a
      heat transfer coefficient for transfer of heat from the heated gas
      stream 104 through the heat transfer surface 114b.<br>
      <br>
      [0075] Additionally, a combination of charged species 106 with
      opposite charge carriers in the electrode 110b may release a heat
      of association corresponding to a lower energy state of a neutral
      species. Additionally, the kinetic energy of the charged species
      106 (and other entrained species) impinging on the heat transfer
      surface 114b may be converted to additional heat energy.<br>
      <br>
      [0076] While the flame 102 and burner assembly 103 are depicted in
      FIGS. 1, 2, and 5, as resembling a gas burner and flame, various
      burner embodiments are contemplated. For example, the burner
      assembly may include one or more of a fluidized bed, a grate,
      moving grate, a pulverized coal nozzle, a gas burner, a gas
      nozzle, an oil burner, arrays of burner assemblies, or other
      embodiments. Flames 102 may include laminar flames, other
      diffusion flames, premixed flames, turbulent flames, agitated
      flames, stoichiometric flames, non-stoichiometric flames, or
      combinations thereof.<br>
      <br>
      [0000] Driving Heat Away from a Surface<br>
      <br>
      [0077] While description above has focused on driving heat energy
      toward a surface, other embodiments can drive heat energy away
      from a surface. Generally, this can be accomplished by inverting
      either the polarity of the highest concentration charged species
      in the gas stream, by moving the location of the electrode(s) with
      respect to the heat transfer (or temperature-sensitive)
      surface(s), by inverting the voltage waveform applied to the
      electrode(s), or by applying a (opposite sign) bias voltage to the
      waveform. In most combustion systems, the highest mass and highest
      stability charged species are positively charged. Therefore, for
      most practical solutions involving combustion systems, the best
      options may involve either moving the electrode(s), substantially
      inverting the voltage waveform applied to the electrode(s), or by
      applying or inverting a bias voltage to the voltage waveform.<br>
      <br>
      [0078] FIG. 7 is a diagram of a system 701 configured to protect a
      temperature-sensitive surface 702 and/or an underlying
      temperature-sensitive structure 704 from heat transfer, according
      to an embodiment. The operation of the system 701 may correspond
      to the operation of the system 101 shown in FIG. 1, except that
      the electric field or the charged species population is inverted.<br>
      <br>
      [0079] The system 701 may typically include a flame 102 supported
      by a burner assembly 103. A combustion reaction in the flame 102
      generates a heated gas 104, that exhibits a mass a flow
      illustrated by the arrow 105, carrying electrically charged
      species 106, 108. Typically, the electrically charged species
      include positively charged species 106 and negatively charged
      species 108.<br>
      <br>
      [0080] Providing a heated gas carrying charged species 106, 108
      may include burning at least one fuel from a fuel source 118, the
      combustion reaction providing at least a portion of the charged
      species and combustion gasses. According to some embodiments, the
      combustion reaction may provide substantially all the charged
      species 106, 108.<br>
      <br>
      [0081] The charged species 106, 108 may include unburned fuel;
      intermediate radicals such as hydride, hydroperoxide, and hydroxyl
      radicals; particulates and other ash; pyrolysis products; charged
      gas molecules; and free electrons, for example. At various stages
      of combustion, the mix of charged species 106, 108 may vary. As
      will be discussed below, some embodiments may remove a portion of
      the charged species 106 or 108 in a first portion of the heated
      gas 104, leaving a charge imbalance in another portion of the
      heated gas 104.<br>
      <br>
      [0082] For example, one embodiment may remove a portion of
      negative species 108 including substantially only electrons,
      leaving a positive charge imbalance in the gas stream 104.
      Positive species 106 may then be electrostatically attracted away
      from the vicinity of a structure 704, resulting in reduced heat
      transfer across a temperature-sensitive surface 702 of the
      structure 704 and to the temperature-sensitive structure 704
      itself. Alternatively, a portion of positive species 106 may be
      removed from the heated gas stream 104, leaving a negative charge
      imbalance in the gas stream. While the negative species 108 is
      shown with a drift velocity toward the structure 704 and the
      temperature-sensitive surface 702, the waveform applied to the
      voltage source may, in fact, cause a net neutral path along the
      mass flow 105 or may also drive the negatively charges species
      away from the structure 704 with its temperature-sensitive
      surface. This may be done by controlling modulation on-off cycles
      and the duty cycle of the waveform in a manner corresponding to
      the charge/mass ratio of the negative species 108. Alternatively,
      with a low enough mass negative species 108 and/or depopulation of
      the negative species 108, the negative species 108 may impart
      negligible momentum upon the gas stream 104, and thus may not
      result in substantial movement of heated gases toward the
      structure 104 and temperature-sensitive surface 702.<br>
      <br>
      [0083] A first electrode 110 may be voltage modulated by a voltage
      source 112. The voltage modulation may be configured to create a
      voltage potential across the heated gas stream 104 to drive a
      portion of the charged species 106, here illustrated as positive,
      away from the structure 704 and temperature-sensitive surface 702.
      Modulating the first electrode may include driving the first
      electrode to one or more voltages selected to, in combination with
      a counter electrode 706, repel oppositely charged species, and the
      repelled oppositely charged species imparting momentum transfer to
      the heated gas.<br>
      <br>
      [0084] The momentum from the electrically driven charged species
      106 may be transferred to non-charged particles, unburned fuel,
      ash, air, etc. carrying heat. The modulated first electrode 110
      may be configured to repel the charged species and other entrained
      species carrying heat to preferentially flow away from a
      temperature-sensitive surface 702. As the heat-carrying species
      flow away from to the heat transfer surface 114, a reduced portion
      of the heat carried by the heated gas 105 is transferred through
      the temperature-sensitive surface 702 to the structure 704.<br>
      <br>
      [0085] According to an embodiment, the first electrode 110 may be
      arranged near the temperature-sensitive surface 702. A nominal
      mass flow 105 may be characterized by a velocity (including speed
      and direction). The first electrode 110 may be configured to
      impart a drift velocity to the charged species 106 at an angle to
      the nominal mass flow velocity 105 and away from the
      temperature-sensitive surface 702.<br>
      <br>
      [0086] As mentioned above, the system 701 may further modulate at
      least one second electrode 120 to remove a portion of the charged
      species 106, 108. According to an embodiment, the second electrode
      120 may preferentially purge negatively-charged species 108 from
      the heated gas 104. According to an embodiment, the second
      electrode may preferentially purge a portion of electrons 108 from
      the heated gas 104.<br>
      <br>
      [0087] According to an embodiment, the at least one second
      electrode 120 may include a burner assembly 103 that supports a
      flame 102, the flame 102 providing a locus for the combustion
      reaction. The second electrode 120 may be driven with a waveform
      from the voltage source 112. Alternatively, the second electrode
      may be driven from another voltage source or may be held at
      ground.<br>
      <br>
      [0088] The counter electrode 706, which may be referred to as a
      third electrode (whether or not the optional second electrode is
      present), is shown as electrically coupled to ground. The third
      electrode 706 may optionally be formed as a grounded combustion
      system structure, and may thus not be an explicit structure.
      Optionally, the third electrode 706 may be driven from the voltage
      source 112 (via a connection that is not shown that replaces the
      ground connection) or another voltage source (not shown) with a
      waveform that is opposite in sign to the waveform applied to the
      electrode 110.<br>
      <br>
      [0089] Optionally, the electrode 110 may be combined with the
      structure 704 or may be formed on the surface of the structure
      704. For example, the first electrode 110 may be disposed over an
      electrical insulator and the electrical insulator is disposed over
      the temperature-sensitive surface 702 or the electrode 110 may be
      formed from the structure 704 and/or the temperature-sensitive
      surface 702. The electrical insulator may, for example, include at
      least one of polyether-ether-ketone, polyimide, silicon dioxide,
      silica glass, alumina, silicon, titanium dioxide, strontium
      titanate, barium strontium titanate, or barium titanate. The first
      electrode 110 may include at least one of graphite, chromium, an
      alloy including chromium, an alloy including molybdenum, tungsten,
      an alloy including tungsten, tantalum, an alloy including
      tantalum, or niobium-doped strontium titanate.<br>
      <br>
      [0090] The structure 704 and temperature-sensitive surface 702,
      optional electrical insulator (not shown), and first electrode 110
      may form at least a portion of a wall of a fire tube or water tube
      boiler. In another example, the temperature-sensitive surface 702
      and the structure 704 may include a turbine blade or other
      structure subject to degradation by exposure to the hot gas stream
      104. The temperature protection approaches shown herein may then
      be used to extend turbine (or other structure) life, improve
      reliability, reduce weight, and/or increase thrust by allowing
      hotter combustion gases 104 without degrading the
      temperature-sensitive structure(s) 704 and/or
      temperature-sensitive surface(s) 702. The temperature-sensitive
      surface 702 (and optionally structure 704) may include one or more
      of titanium, a titanium alloy, aluminum, an aluminum alloy, steel,
      stainless steel, a composite material, a fiberglass and epoxy
      material, a Kevlar and epoxy material, or a carbon fiber and epoxy
      material.<br>
      <br>
      [0091] Optionally, the electrode 110 may be positioned away from
      the structure 704 and temperature-sensitive surface 702 to
      directly exert an attractive force on the majority species 106.
      FIG. 8 is a diagram of a system configured to protect a
      temperature-sensitive surface 702 and/or an underlying
      temperature-sensitive structure 704 from heat transfer, according
      to an embodiment where the electrode 110 is positioned distal from
      the structure 704 and surface 702. The operation of the system 701
      may correspond to the operation of the system 101 shown in FIG. 1,
      except that the position of the electrode 110 is moved away from
      the surface 702.<br>
      <br>
      [0092] The system 801 may typically include a flame 102 supported
      by a burner assembly 103. A combustion reaction in the flame 102
      generates a heated gas 104, that exhibits a mass a flow
      illustrated by the arrow 105, carrying electrically charged
      species 106, 108. Typically, the electrically charged species
      include positively charged species 106 and negatively charged
      species 108. Operation of the combustion portion of the system 801
      and the optional second electrode 120 may be substantially
      identical to the operation of the system 701, as described above.<br>
      <br>
      [0093] Positive species 106 and remaining negative species 108 may
      then be electrostatically attracted away from the vicinity of the
      structure 704, resulting in reduced heat transfer across a
      temperature-sensitive surface 702 of the structure 704 and to the
      temperature-sensitive structure 704 itself. Alternatively, a
      portion of positive species 106 may be removed from the heated gas
      stream 104, leaving a negative charge imbalance in the gas stream.<br>
      <br>
      [0094] A first electrode 110 may be voltage modulated by a voltage
      source 112. The voltage modulation may be configured to create a
      voltage potential across the heated gas stream 104 to drive a
      portion of the charged species 106, here illustrated as positive,
      away from the structure 704 and temperature-sensitive surface 702.
      Modulating the first electrode may include driving the first
      electrode to one or more voltages selected to, in combination with
      a counter electrode 706, attract oppositely charged species, with
      the attracted oppositely charged species imparting momentum
      transfer to the heated gas 104. As described above, while the
      negative species 108 is shown with a drift velocity toward the
      structure 704 and the temperature-sensitive surface 702, the
      waveform applied to the voltage source may, in fact, cause a net
      neutral path along the mass flow 105 or may also drive the
      negatively charges species away from the structure 704 with its
      temperature-sensitive surface 702.<br>
      <br>
      [0095] The momentum from the electrically driven charged species
      106 may be transferred to non-charged particles, unburned fuel,
      ash, air, etc. carrying heat. The modulated first electrode 110
      may be configured to attract the charged species and other
      entrained species carrying heat to preferentially flow away from a
      temperature-sensitive surface 702. As the heat-carrying species
      flow away from to the heat-sensitive surface 702, a reduced
      portion of the heat carried by the heated gas 105 is transferred
      through the temperature-sensitive surface 702 to the structure
      704.<br>
      <br>
      [0096] A counter electrode 706, which may be referred to as a
      third electrode (whether or not the optional second electrode is
      present), is shown as electrically coupled to ground. The third
      electrode 706 may optionally be formed as a grounded combustion
      system structure, and may thus not be an explicit structure.
      Optionally, the third electrode 706 may be driven from the voltage
      source 112 (via a connection that is not shown that replaces the
      ground connection) or another voltage source (not shown) with a
      waveform that is opposite in sign to the waveform applied to the
      electrode 110.<br>
      <br>
      [0097] Optionally, the electrode 706 may be combined with the
      structure 704 or may be formed on the surface of the structure
      704. For example, the third electrode 706 may be disposed over an
      electrical insulator and the electrical insulator is disposed over
      the temperature-sensitive surface 702 or the third electrode 706
      may be formed from the structure 704 and/or the
      temperature-sensitive surface 702. The electrical insulator may,
      for example, include at least one of polyether-ether-ketone,
      polyimide, silicon dioxide, silica glass, alumina, silicon,
      titanium dioxide, strontium titanate, barium strontium titanate,
      or barium titanate. The third electrode 706 may include at least
      one of graphite, chromium, an alloy including chromium, an alloy
      including molybdenum, tungsten, an alloy including tungsten,
      tantalum, an alloy including tantalum, or niobium-doped strontium
      titanate.<br>
      <br>
      [0098] The structure 704 and temperature-sensitive surface 702,
      optional electrical insulator (not shown), and third electrode 706
      may form at least a portion of a wall of a fire tube or water tube
      boiler. In another example, the temperature-sensitive surface 702
      and the structure 704 may include a turbine blade or other
      structure subject to degradation by exposure to the hot gas stream
      104. The temperature protection approaches shown herein may then
      be used to extend turbine (or other structure) life, improve
      reliability, reduce weight, and/or increase thrust by allowing
      hotter combustion gases 104 without degrading the
      temperature-sensitive structure(s) 704 and/or
      temperature-sensitive surface(s) 702. The temperature-sensitive
      surface 702 (and optionally structure 704) may include one or more
      of titanium, a titanium alloy, aluminum, an aluminum alloy, steel,
      stainless steel, a composite material, a fiberglass and epoxy
      material, a Kevlar and epoxy material, or a carbon fiber and epoxy
      material.<br>
      <br>
      [0099] Optionally, the approaches related to heat attraction
      (shown in FIG. 1 and elsewhere) may be combined with the
      approaches related to heat protection (shown in FIGS. 7 and 8).
      For example, the voltage source 112 may be configured to
      preferentially apply heat to a heat sink 116 during a portion of a
      cycle or for a period, and then preferentially remove heat from
      the heat sink structure 704 during another portion of the cycle or
      after the period is over. This may be used, for example, to
      temporarily apply higher thrust against a turbine blade, such as
      during periods of full military power, and then allow the turbine
      blades to cool in order to avoid structural failure.<br>
      <br>
      [0100] While the flame 102 in FIGS. 7 and 8 is illustrated in a
      shape typical of a diffusion flame, other combustion reaction
      distributions may be provided, depending upon a given embodiment.<br>
      <br>
      [0101] Various configurations of embodiments depicted in FIGS. 7
      and 8 are contemplated. For example, the first electrode 110
      and/or the third electrode 706 may either or each include a
      plurality of electrodes configured to impart drift velocities to
      electrically charged species at a plurality of angles to the
      nominal mass flow velocity. The first electrode 110 and/or the
      third electrode 706 may include a plurality of first electrodes
      110 and/or third electrodes 706, and the temperature-sensitive
      surface 702 (and structure(s) 704) may include a plurality of
      temperature-sensitive surfaces 702 (704). At least a portion of
      the plurality of first electrodes 110 may then be interdigitated
      with at least a portion of the plurality of temperature-sensitive
      surfaces 702.<br>
      <br>
      [0102] As indicated above, the voltage waveform provided by the
      voltage source 112 may be driven as indicated elsewhere herein,
      typically inverted or at an opposite bias for the arrangement 701
      of FIG. 7, or directly as previously shown for the arrangement 801
      of FIG. 8. The waveform may include a dc negative voltage, an ac
      voltage including a negative portion, or an ac voltage on a dc
      negative bias voltage for the arrangement of FIG. 8. Similarly,
      the waveform may include a dc positive voltage, an ac voltage
      including a positive portion, or an ac voltage on a dc positive
      bias voltage for the arrangement of FIG. 7.<br>
