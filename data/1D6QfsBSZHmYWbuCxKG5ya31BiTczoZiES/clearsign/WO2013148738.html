      A solid fuel burner may include a system for electrodynamic
      homogenization. One or more electrodes may apply an electric field
      to burning solid fuel or a region proximate the burning solid
      fuel. The electric field causes mixing and homogenization of
      volatilized fractions of the solid fuel, combustion gases, and
      air. The improved mixing and homogenization may reduce emission of
      carbon monoxide (CO), reduce emission of oxides of nitrogen (NOx),
      reduce oxygen in flue gas, increase temperature of flue gas,
      and/or allow for a larger grate surface.<br>
      <br>
      The present application claims priority benefit from U.S.
      Provisional Patent Application No. 61/640,695, entitled "SOLID
      FUEL BURNER WITH ELECTRODYNAMIC HOMOGENIZATION", filed April 30,
      2012; and from U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/616,223,
      entitled "MULTIPLE FUEL COMBUSTION SYSTEM AND METHOD", filed March
      27, 2012; which, to the extent not inconsistent with the
      disclosure herein, are incorpor ted by reference. BACKGROUND<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 1 is a diagram illustrating a portion of a grate-fed solid
      fuel burner 101 according to the prior art and which is improved
      according to the disclosure herein. A solid fuel burner may
      include walls 102 defining a combustion volume and a grate 104 on
      which solid fuel 106 is supported. Underfire combustion air may be
      delivered to the fuel from below the grate 104 via an underfire or
      primary air source 108 from an air blower 1 10. Hot gas 1 12 may
      then be delivered to generate electricity (e.g., by heating water
      tubes for delivery of steam to a steam turbine), to heat air
      (e.g., by transferring energy through an air-air heat<br>
      <br>
      exchanger), or for heating a process material. The fuel 106 may
      include various solid fuels such as lump coal (e.g. anthracite,
      bituminous coal, and/or lignite), biomass fuel, tire-derived fuel
      (TDF), municipal solid waste (MSW), refuse derived fuel (RDF),
      hazardous solid waste, etc.<br>
      <br>
      Solid fuel burners are notorious for non-ideal flow behavior such
      as clumping. Fuel clumping has been associated with variable
      resistance to undergrate air flow. Fuel clumping may be visualized
      as a formation of "hills" 1 14 and "valleys" 1 16 in fuel 106 on
      the grate 104. The hills 1 14 typically have high resistance to
      airflow, and the valleys 1 16 typically have low resistance to
      airflow. Additionally, airflow may be affected by proximity to the
      walls 102. A result of this variable resistance to airflow is that
      there may be less airflow than desirable in regions 1 18 above the
      hills 1 14, and more airflow than desirable in regions 120 above
      the valleys 1 16. Moreover, the solid fuel 106 typically
      volatilizes responsive to high temperatures from combustion, and
      it is the volatilized, gas phase components that actually burn.
      There may be more volatilization above the hills 1 14 than the
      valleys 1 16, which may further add to the disparity in
      composition between the regions 1 18 above the hills 1 14 and the
      regions 120 above the valleys.<br>
      <br>
      The non-homogeneity of the regions 1 18, 120 leads to two
      undesirable conditions. Regions 1 18 with low airflow tend not to
      have enough oxygen for complete combustion. This results in cooler
      temperatures and high output of carbon monoxide (CO) and other
      products of incomplete combustion.<br>
      <br>
      Conversely, excess airflow in the regions 120 causes high
      temperatures and relatively high concentrations of oxygen and
      nitrogen, both of which tend to cause formation of oxides of
      nitrogen (NOx).<br>
      <br>
      Manufacturers and operators of solid fuel burners 101 have
      attempted to ameliorate the problems associated with
      non-homogeneity by introducing overfire or secondary air above the
      grate 104 and the fuel 106 with one or more overfire air sources
      122. The overfire air is typically introduced at high velocity to
      help mixing of the regions 1 18, 120. Unfortunately, while
      overfire air may provide more oxygen to complete combustion of CO
      to carbon dioxide (CO 2), it may not affect or can even make more
      severe the formation of NOx. Moreover, it is typical that overfire
      air is added in excess. Excess overfire air reduces the
      temperature of flue gases 1 12 and can reduce thermodynamic
      efficiency of processes driven by the heat produced by combustion.
      Reduced thermodynamic efficiency may generally require burning
      more fuel to create a desired output, or may reduce the amount of
      the output for a given amount of fuel. Finally, the ability to
      deliver overfire air across a wide grate 104 is limited by the
      amount of inertia that can be imparted on the overfire air and the
      distance it can travel through buoyant forces associated with the
      combustion.<br>
      <br>
      What is needed is a technology that can improve uniformity or
      homogeneity of reactive gases associated with a solid fuel burner.
      It is also desirable to improve gas homogeneity with minimum
      cooling of exit gas temperature. Finally, some applications by
      benefiting from improved homogeneity across a grate having
      dimensions larger than what may be addressed by overfire air.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY</b><br>
      <br>
      According to an embodiment, a solid fuel burner may be provided
      with a system for providing electrodynamic homogenization. The
      solid fuel burner may include a grate configured to support a
      burning solid fuel and an underfire air source configured to
      deliver underfire air to the burning solid fuel from below the
      grate. The system for providing electrodynamic homogenization may
      include an electrode (one or more electrodes) configured to apply
      an electric field to the burning solid fuel or a region proximate
      the burning solid fuel. The electric field, which may include a
      time-varying electric field, may be selected to cause mixing and
      homogenization of volatilized fractions of the solid fuel,
      combustion gases, and air. The improved mixing and homogenization
      may result in reduced emission of carbon monoxide (CO), reduced
      emission of oxides of nitrogen (NOx), reduced oxygen in flue gas,
      increased temperature of flue gas, and/or allow for a larger grate
      surface.<br>
      <br>
      According to an embodiment, a solid fuel burner may include a
      system for providing electrodynamic homogenization. The system may
      include a grate configured to support a burning solid fuel and an
      underfire air source configured to deliver underfire air to the
      burning solid fuel from below the grate. An electrode (one or more
      electrodes) may be configured to apply an electric field to the
      burning solid fuel or a region proximate the burning solid fuel.
      The electric field, which may include a time-varying electric
      field, may be selected to cause mixing and homogenization of
      volatilized fractions of the solid fuel, combustion gases, and
      air. The improved mixing and homogenization may result in reduced
      emission of carbon monoxide (CO), reduced emission of oxides of
      nitrogen (NOx), reduced oxygen in flue gas, increased temperature
      of flue gas, and/or allow for a larger grate surface.<br>
      <br>
      According to another embodiment, a method for operating a solid
      fuel burner may include delivering underfire combustion air below
      a grate, burning solid fuel on the grate with the combustion air
      in a combustion reaction, and homogenizing a mixture of
      volatilized solid fuel and underfire combustion air in the
      combustion reaction by applying an electric field with at least
      one electrode disposed above the grate or comprising the grate.
      The electric field may include a time-varying electric field.<br>

      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b>In the following detailed description, reference is made to
      the accompanying drawings, which form a part hereof. In the
      drawings, similar symbols typically identify similar components,
      unless context dictates otherwise. The illustrative embodiments
      described in the detailed description, drawings, and claims are
      not meant to be limiting. Other embodiments may be utilized, and
      other changes may be made, without departing from the spirit or
      scope of the subject matter presented here.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 2 is a diagram of a solid fuel burner 201 configured for<br>
      <br>
      electrodynamic homogenization, according to an embodiment. The
      solid fuel burner 201 may include a grate 104 configured to
      support a burning solid fuel 106. An underfire air source 108 may
      be configured to deliver underfire air to the burning solid fuel
      106 from below the grate 104. One may alternatively refer to the
      underfire air source 108as a primary air source or an undergrate
      air source. A system for providing electrodynamic homogenization
      may include an electrode 202 configured to apply an electric field
      to the burning solid fuel 106 or a region 1 18, 120 proximate the
      burning solid fuel 106. The electric field may be selected to
      cause mixing and homogenization of volatilized fractions of the
      solid fuel, combustion gases, and air.<br>
      <br>
      Various electrode embodiments are contemplated. As illustrated in
      the embodiment 201 , the electrode 202 may be disposed above the
      grate 104 and the solid fuel 106. FIG. 3 is a diagram of a solid
      fuel burner 301 configured for electrodynamic homogenization
      according to another embodiment wherein the electrode 302 includes
      the grate 104. As may be appreciated by inspection of FIGS. 2 and
      3, the solid fuel burner may include a wall 102 defining a<br>
      <br>
      combustion volume. The electrode 202, 302 may be disposed inside
      the combustion volume. Alternatively, the electrode may be
      disposed outside the combustion volume. FIG. 4 is a diagram of a
      solid fuel burner 401 according to another embodiment where the
      electrode 402 is disposed outside the<br>
      <br>
      combustion volume.<br>
      <br>
      The electrode 202, 302, 402 may include a plurality of electrodes.
      Such a plurality may include plural electrodes 202 located in the
      combustion volume, plural grate electrodes 302 located in the
      combustion volume and/or plural electrodes 402 located outside the
      combustion volume. Plural electrodes may also include combinations
      of two or more of the electrodes 202, 302, 402 indicated
      diagramnnatically in FIGS. 2-4. It will be understood (unless
      expressly indicated otherwise) that references to "an electrode"
      herein shall refer to any combination of single or plural
      electrodes indicated in the embodiments 201 , 301 , 401 .<br>
      <br>
      Referring to FIGS. 2-4 and the embodiments 201 , 301 , 401 ,<br>
      <br>
      homogenization may increase uniformity in oxygen and combustion
      reactant concentrations above the grate 104. As described above,
      concentration differences without the electrodynamic
      homogenization may include a more oxidizing atmosphere 120 above
      regions of the grate 104 carrying a small solid fuel 106 pile
      depth 1 16, and a more reducing atmosphere 1 18 above regions of
      the grate 104 carrying a large solid fuel 106 pile depth 1 14.<br>
      <br>
      The solid fuel burner 201 , 301 , 401 may include an overfire air
      source 122 configured to deliver overfire air above the grate 104.
      Application of the electric field by the electrode 202, 302, 402
      may result in a reduction in the amount of overfire air required
      to meet emission requirements compared to a system not including
      the electrode 202, 302, 402 and/or not providing electrodynamic
      homogenization. Application of the electric field by the electrode
      202, 302, 402 may result in a reduction in an amount of underfire
      or undergrate air required to meet emission requirements compared
      to a system not including the electrode 202, 302, 402 and/or not
      providing electrodynamic homogenization. Similarly, application of
      the electric field by the electrode 202, 302, 402 may result in a
      reduction in the amount of total air required to meet emission
      requirements compared to a system not including the electrode 202,
      302, 402 and/or not providing electrodynamic homogenization.
      Finally, the application of the electric field by the electrode
      202, 302, 402 may result in a reduction in an emission of one or
      more of oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and carbon monoxide (CO) from the
      solid fuel 106 burning compared to a system not including the
      electrode 202, 302, 402 and/or not providing electrodynamic
      homogenization.<br>
      <br>
      According to embodiments, the application of the electric field by
      the electrode 202, 302, 402 may result in heat release nearer the
      solid fuel 106 compared to a system not including the electrode
      202, 302, 402 and/or not providing electrodynamic homogenization.
      The release of heat nearer the solid fuel 106 may provide enhanced
      drying of the solid fuel 106. This may allow the use of lower
      grade fuels, reduced pre-processing of fuel, and/or may allow the
      use of fuels that cannot normally be fired without application of
      heat from a second combustion reaction (e.g., co-firing with
      natural gas).<br>
      <br>
      The solid fuel burner 201 , 301 , 401 may include an electrode
      controller 204 operatively coupled to the electrode(s) 202, 302,
      402 and configured to determine an electrode 202, 302, 402 voltage
      or charge concentration corresponding to the electric field. The
      electrode controller 204 may include one or more of a state
      machine, a field-programmable gate array, a microcontroller, or
      discrete components configured to determine the electric field.<br>
      <br>
      The solid fuel burner 201 , 301 , 401 may include an amplifier or
      voltage multiplier 206 operatively coupled to the electrode
      controller 204 and the electrode(s) 202, 302, 402, or included in
      the electrode controller 204 and operatively coupled to the
      electrode(s) 202, 302, 402. The amplifier or voltage multiplier
      206 may be configured to output an operating voltage waveform to
      the electrode(s) 202, 302, 402 responsive to a logic level digital
      or low voltage analog signal received from the electrode
      controller 204.<br>
      <br>
      According to embodiments, the electric field may include a
      time-varying electric field and the voltage may similarly
      correspond to a time-varying voltage applied to the electrode(s).
      For example, the time-varying electric field may include an
      electric field that varies according to an alternating current
      (AC) voltage waveform applied to the electrode(s). The
      time-varying voltage may include a sinusoidal, square wave,
      sawtooth wave, triangular wave, truncated triangular wave,
      logarithmic, or exponential waveform. Various voltages may be
      used. For example, the time-varying voltage applied to the
      electrode(s) may include a periodic voltage having an amplitude of
      4000 to 1 15,000 volts (or ± 4000 to 1 15,000 volts). The
      time-varying voltage may include a periodic voltage having a
      frequency of 50 to 800 Hertz, for example. According to some
      embodiments, the time-varying voltage can have a periodic
      frequency of 200 Hertz to 300 Hertz.<br>
      <br>
      According to embodiments, the solid fuel burner 201 , 301 , 401
      may include one or more sensors (not shown) operatively coupled to
      the electrode controller 204 and configured to measure one or more
      characteristics of the burning of the solid fuel 106, the flame,
      or combustion gas produced by the burning solid fuel 106. For
      example, the one or more sensors (not shown) may be configured to
      measure a variable characteristic of a completeness of combustion
      or a fuel 106 characteristic. The electrode controller 204 may be
      configured to select an electric field characteristic to increase
      gas mixing when the completeness of combustion is lower than a
      target value or when the fuel 106 characteristic corresponds to a
      need to increase mixing.<br>
      <br>
      The solid fuel burner 201 (and variants 301 , 401 ) may include a<br>
      <br>
      mechanical or pneumatic stoker (not shown) configured to deliver
      the solid fuel 106 to the grate 104 assembly.<br>
      <br>
      The electrode controller 204 may be configured to control one or
      more of an overfire air 122 flow, the underfire air 108 flow, or a
      rate of fuel delivered by a stoker. Alternatively or additionally,
      the solid fuel burner 201 , 301 , 401 may include one or more of
      an overfire air controller (not shown), an underfire air
      controller (not shown), or a stoker controller (not shown)
      operatively coupled to the electrode controller 204.<br>
      <br>
      The solid fuel burner 201 , 301 , 401 may include a physical gap
      (not shown) between a stoker (not shown) and the solid fuel 106 on
      the grate 104, the gap being configured to reduce or eliminate
      current leakage from the electric field through fuel carried by
      the stoker (not shown). Optionally, the solid fuel burner 201 ,
      301 , 401 may include a fuel cache (not shown) operatively coupled
      to a fuel stoker (not shown) and electrical insulation (not shown)
      between the fuel cache (not shown) and a support structure (not
      shown) The fuel cache (not shown) and the electrical insulation
      (not shown) may be configured to reduce or eliminate current
      leakage from the electric field through the stoker (not shown) and
      fuel positioned near a stoker intake (not shown).<br>
      <br>
      Burning of various types of solid fuels are contemplated to
      benefit from electrodynamic homogenization. For example, the solid
      fuel 106 may include at least one of a biomass fuel, coal, a
      tire-derived fuel (TDF), municipal solid waste (MSW), refuse
      derived fuel (RDF), or a hazardous solid waste.<br>
      <br>
      FIG 5 is a flow chart depicting a method 501 for operating a solid
      fuel burner with electrodynamic homogenization of the combustion
      reaction. In step 502 solid fuel may be delivered to a grate. For
      example, the solid fuel may be delivered to the grate with a
      mechanical or pneumatic stoker.<br>
      <br>
      Proceeding to step 504, underfire combustion air may be fed from
      below the grate. In step 506, solid fuel on the grate may be
      burned with at least the underfire combustion air in a combustion
      reaction. Burning the solid fuel may include burning the solid
      fuel in a combustion volume defined by a wall.<br>
      <br>
      Proceeding to step 508, a mixture of volatilized solid fuel and
      underfire combustion air above the fuel is homogenized by applying
      an electric field with at least one electrode. Various electrode
      arrangements are contemplated. For example, applying the electric
      field with at least one electrode may include applying an electric
      field with at least one electrode disposed inside the combustion
      volume. For example, the at least one electrode may be disposed
      above the grate. Alternatively or additionally, the at least one
      electrode may include the grate. According to embodiments,
      applying the electric field with at least one electrode may
      include applying the electric field with at least one electrode
      disposed outside the combustion volume. The at least one electrode
      may include a single electrode, or may include a plurality of
      electrodes. The plurality of electrodes may include a plurality of
      electrodes disposed similarly, for example, all electrodes being
      above the grate, all electrodes including portions of the grate,
      or all electrodes being disposed outside the combustion volume.
      Alternatively, a plurality of electrodes may include one or more
      electrodes above the grate, one or more electrodes comprising the
      grate, and/or one or more electrodes disposed outside the
      combustion volume.<br>
      <br>
      Step 508 may include operating an electrode controller to
      determine the electric field. In some embodiments, the electric
      field may be a DC electric field or an intermittently applied DC
      electric field. Alternatively, the electric field may include a
      time-varying electric field. Operating the electrode controller
      may include amplifying a logic level digital or low voltage analog
      signal received from the electrode controller to an operating
      voltage placed on the at least one electrode. Additionally or
      alternatively, operating the electrode controller may include one
      or more of operating a state machine, operating a field-
      programmable gate array, operating a microcontroller, or operating
      discrete components configured to determine (optionally
      time-varying) electric field.<br>
      <br>
      A time-varying electric field may include an electric field that
      varies according to an alternating current (AC) voltage waveform
      applied to the electrode(s). The time-varying electric field may
      include a sinusoidal, square wave, sawtooth wave, triangular wave,
      truncated triangular wave, logarithmic, or exponential waveform.<br>
      <br>
      Applying a time-varying voltage to the electrode to produce a
      time-varying electric field in step 508 may include applying a
      periodic voltage having an amplitude of 4000 to 1 15,000 volts.
      Applying a time-varying voltage to the electrode to produce a
      time-varying electric field may include applying a time- varying
      periodic voltage having a frequency of 50 to 800 Hertz. According
      to some embodiments, the time-varying voltage can have a periodic
      frequency of 200 Hertz to 300 Hertz.<br>
      <br>
      Optionally, the method 501 may include operating one or more
      sensors operatively coupled to the electrode controller to measure
      one or more characteristics of the combustion reaction. For
      example, operating one or more sensors may include measuring a
      variable characteristic of a completeness of combustion. Operating
      the electrode controller in step 508 may include selecting the
      electric field to increase the homogenization when the
      completeness of combustion is lower than a target value.<br>
      <br>
      The electrodynamic homogenization may increase uniformity in
      oxygen concentration above the grate. The differences may be
      caused by solid fuel pile depth variations across the grate, the
      differences include a more oxidizing atmosphere above regions of
      the grate carrying a small solid fuel pile depth and a more
      reducing atmosphere above regions of the grate carrying a large
      solid fuel pile depth.<br>
      <br>
      The application of the electric field by the electrode in step 508
      may further increase the release of heat near the fuel. This may
      be used to dry wet fuel, pre-heat difficult-to-burn fuel, or
      otherwise improve fuel flexibility.<br>
      <br>
      Proceeding to step 510, overfire or secondary air may be applied
      over the burning fuel on the grate. For example, this may include
      operating an overfire air source. Operating the overfire air
      source may include delivering sufficient overfire air to
      substantially complete combustion of the solid fuel. The
      application of the electric field by the electrode may results in
      a reduction in the amount of overfire air required to meet
      emission requirements compared to a system not including the
      electrode. Additionally or alternatively, the electrodynamic
      homogenization provided by the application of the electric field
      by the electrode may result in a reduction in an amount of
      underfire air required to meet emission requirements compared to a
      system not including the electrode. Moreover, the application of
      the electric field by the electrode may results in a reduction in
      an amount of total air required to meet emission requirements
      compared to a system not including the electrode.<br>
      <br>
      The application of the electric field by the electrode may result
      in a reduction in an emission of one or more of oxides of nitrogen
      (NOx) and carbon monoxide (CO) from the solid fuel burning
      compared to a system not including the electrode to apply the
      electric field.<br>
      <br>
      The method 501 may optionally include controlling one or more of
      an overfire air flow, the underfire air flow, or a rate of fuel
      delivered by the stoker. Additionally or alternatively, the method
      501 may include communicating, from an electrode controller, with
      one or more of an overfire air controller, an underfire air
      controller or a stoker controller.<br>
      <br>
      The solid fuel may include a biomass fuel, coal, tire-derived fuel
      (TDF), or other solid fuel. As mentioned above, fuel flexibility
      may be improved by the electrodynamic homogenization.<br>
      <br>
      In cases where the solid fuel is delivered to the grate with a
      stoker, current leakage from the electric field through the solid
      fuel may be reduced or eliminated by maintaining an air gap
      between the stoker and the solid fuel on the grate. Additionally
      or alternatively, current leakage from the electric field through
      the fuel may be reduced or eliminated by delivering electrically
      isolated fuel to a fuel cache, maintaining electrical insulation
      between the fuel cache and a support structure and between the
      stoker and the support structure. The stoker may deliver the solid
      fuel from the electrically isolated fuel cache.<br>
      <br>
      Proceeding to step 512, heat from the combustion may be supplied.
      For example, the heat may be supplied to an electrical generation
      system, a chemical process, or to provide domestic heating.<br>
      <br>
      The method for operating a solid fuel burner 301 may include
      operating one or more sensors operatively coupled to an electrode
      controller to measure one or more characteristics of the
      combustion reaction. Operating one or more sensors may include
      measuring a variable characteristic of a completeness of
      combustion. Operating the electrode controller may include
      selecting the time- varying electric field to increase the
      homogenization when the completeness of combustion is lower than a
      target value. At least one sensor (not shown) may be disposed to
      sense a condition proximate the burning fuel or a combustion gas
      above the burning fuel. The first sensor may be operatively
      coupled to the electrode controller via a sensor signal
      transmission path (not shown). The at least one sensor (not shown)
      may be configured to sense a combustion parameter of the burning
      fuel or the combustion gas above the burning fuel. For example the
      at least one sensor may include one or more of a flame luminance
      sensor, a photo-sensor, an infrared sensor, a fuel flow sensor, a
      temperature sensor, a flue gas temperature sensor, a radio
      frequency sensor, and/or an airflow sensor.<br>
