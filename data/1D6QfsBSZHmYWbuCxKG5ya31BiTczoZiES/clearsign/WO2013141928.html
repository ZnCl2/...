          <b>BACKGROUND</b><b></b><br>
          <b> </b><br>
          Gas turbines, which (for example) are used in terrestrial
          power generation and jet aircraft propulsion, include turbine
          blades that are design-constrained according to a maximum
          "lift" or rotational force that may be applied by any one
          blade under a given set of conditions. One limiting factor is
          a tendency for streamwise pressure variation along a low
          pressure side of the turbine blade to cause a near-surface
          velocity reversal with concomitant loss of stream adhesion to
          the turbine blade. The phenomenon of loss of adhesion may
          typically be referred to as flow separation. Flow separation
          may be regarded as a form of aerodynamic stall. The tendency
          to undergo flow separation may be most pronounced near
          trailing edges of the turbine blades. According to a related
          application, gas turbine blades may be configured to operate
          at higher than previously attainable combustion gas (free
          stream) temperatures through the use of Coulombic repulsion of
          charged particles in the combustion gas, combined with
          film-cooling. This may result in higher thermodynamic
          efficiency of the gas turbine. However, a higher free stream
          temperature may result in higher lift per turbine blade at
          relatively lower free stream velocity. This greater lift at
          lower velocity may increase streamwise pressure variations
          along the low pressure side of the turbine blade, and hence
          (absent redesign of turbine blade aerodynamics) may be
          associated with an increased propensity for flow separation .<br>
          <br>
          Moreover, the Coulombic repulsion itself may tend to urge the
          free stream away from surfaces of the turbine blade, and
          further add to flow separation, especially on the low pressure
          side of the turbine blade.<br>
          <br>
          Additionally, the power output range (dynamic range) of a gas
          turbine may be related to an allowable range of combustion gas
          volume delivered to the turbine at a given rotational rate of
          the rotor, which (for a given cross-sectional area) can be
          related to a range of mass flows at which a given turbine<b> </b>blade/stator





          aerodynamic design will work most efficiently. Just as an
          airplane wing will stall at low velocities, corresponding to a
          high angle of attack, and operate less efficiently at
          velocities that differ significantly from a designated cruise
          velocity, turbine blades may suffer similar flow separation at
          extremes of dynamic range.<br>
          <br>
          Moreover, flow separation effects may force gas turbines to
          use a relatively large number of stages to extract all power.
          More stages negatively affect capital cost, weight, and size
          of the gas turbine (particularly the length of the rotor
          shaft).<br>
          <br>
          What is needed is a gas turbine that can operate with a higher
          combustion gas temperature without requiring turbine blade
          redesign, can exhibit larger dynamic range, have a lower
          capital cost, have a lower weight, and/or have a reduced size
          compared to previous gas turbines. SUMMARY<br>
          <br>
          According to an embodiment, a gas turbine may include a
          combustor configured to output a combustion gas stream, the
          combustion gas stream being controlled or driven to at least
          intermittently or periodically include charged particles
          having a first sign. For example the first sign may be
          positive during at least an instant. The gas turbine also
          includes at least one turbine configured to receive the
          combustion gas stream (carrying the charged particles at least
          intermittently or periodically). The turbine includes at least
          one turbine stage having turbine blades. Each turbine blade
          includes a repelling surface configured to be at least
          intermittently or periodically held or driven to a repelling
          voltage having a polarity the same as the charged particles
          having the first sign. At least some turbine blades also
          include an adhesion surface configured to be at least
          intermittently or periodically held, driven, or in equilibrium
          to an adhesion voltage or charge having lower magnitude than
          or opposite polarity from the repelling voltage. This may
          cause a reduced net force of repulsion, the reduction of which
          may improve boundary layer and free stream adhesion. FIG. 3A
          shows an example.<br>
          <br>
          An air channel may be configured to deliver film-cooling air
          adjacent to the repelling surface of the turbine blade.<br>
          <br>
          According to another embodiment, a method of operating a gas
          turbine includes providing a combustion gas stream at least
          intermittently or periodically carrying charged particles
          having a first sign; converting thermodynamic energy to
          rotational energy with turbine blades; at least intermittently
          or periodically applying Coulombic repulsion to the charged
          particles from a repelling portion of each turbine blade by
          applying a repelling voltage to the repelling portion; and at
          least intermittently or periodically applying reduced
          Coulombic repulsion from or increased Coulombic attraction to
          an adhesion portion of each turbine blade by at least one of
          shielding the Coulombic repulsion caused by the repelling
          voltage or by applying an adhesion voltage to attract the
          charged particles to the adhesion portion of the turbine
          blade.<br>
          <br>
          The method may include providing film-cooling air adjacent to
          at least the repelling portion of the turbine blade.<br>
          <br>
          According to an embodiment, a turbine blade includes a
          repelling surface configured to be at least intermittently or
          periodically held or driven to a repelling voltage and an
          adhesion surface configured to be at least intermittently or
          periodically held, driven, or in equilibrium to an adhesion
          voltage or charge having lower magnitude than or opposite
          polarity from the repelling voltage. The turbine blade may
          include a gas channel configured to deliver film-cooling gas
          adjacent to at least the repelling surface. The adhesion
          surface may include an electrical insulator disposed adjacent
          to the repelling surface and an electrical conductor or
          semiconductor disposed adjacent to the electrical insulator.<br>

          <b> </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</b><b></b><br>
          <b> </b><br>
          In the following detailed description, reference is made to
          the accompanying drawings, which form a part hereof. In the
          drawings, similar symbols typically identify similar
          components, unless context dictates otherwise. The
          illustrative embodiments described in the detailed
          description, drawings, and claims are not meant to be
          limiting. Other embodiments may be utilized, and other changes
          may be made, without departing from the spirit or scope of the
          subject matter presented here.<br>
          <br>
          FIG. 1 is a block diagram of a gas turbine 101 , according to
          an embodiment. The gas turbine 101 includes a compressor 1 12
          configured to compress air, the compressed air then entering a
          combustor 1 14. Fuel is burned in the combustor 1 14 to raise
          the temperature of the air and produce combustion products.
          The hot combustion products exit the combustor 1 14 and travel
          through a turbine 1 16. The turbine 1 16 includes turbine
          blades attached to a shaft 1 18. The combustion gases
          impinging on the turbine blades cause rotation of the shaft 1
          18, which provides power to the compressor 1 12. The shaft 1
          18 may also be coupled to fan blades (such as in an aircraft
          jet engine, not shown) or an electrical power generator or
          alternator (such as in a terrestrial power generator or
          aircraft auxiliary power unit (APU), not shown).<br>
          <br>
          Fuel is introduced to the combustor 1 14 through one or more
          nozzles 120. The combustor 1 14 includes a wall 122 that must
          be kept cool. Typically, the wall 122 may be cooled by
          introducing cool air through vents (not shown). The combustor
          wall 122 may also be cooled according to methods described
          herein. Turbine blade cooling air from the compressor may be
          admitted, such as through an air passage 124 formed by the
          shaft 1 18. The turbine blade cooling air provides cooling to
          the shaft 1 18 by forced convection, and travels into the
          turbine blades. Cooling of the turbine blades is described in
          greater detail in conjunction with FIGS. 2 and 3A. According
          to an embodiment, one or more electrode(s) 126 may be disposed
          near the fuel nozzle(s) 120. Optionally, the one or more
          electrode(s) 126 may be coextensive with at least a portion of
          the fuel nozzle(s) 120. The electrode(s) 126 may apply a
          continuous or modulated voltage potential near flame(s)
          anchored by the fuel nozzle(s) 120.<br>
          <br>
          During combustion, a flame produces charged intermediate
          species or transition states. These charged species include
          free electrons, fuel and fuel fragments, oxygen radicals, etc.
          Conservation of charge dictates that positive and negative
          charges nominally balance such that the total charge is
          approximately neutral. The electrode(s) 126 may attract charge
          of opposite sign. For example, the electrode(s) 126 may be
          held or modulated to a positive voltage, and may responsively
          attract electrons from the flame. Similarly, the electrode(s)
          126 may be held or modulated to a negative voltage, which
          responsively removes positively charges species from the
          flame. The electrode(s) 126 may be modulated across a positive
          and negative voltage range, may be modulated in voltage above
          and below a DC bias voltage, and/or may be held at a
          substantially constant DC bias voltage. According to
          embodiments, the electrode(s) 126 may be modulated between
          relative ground and a positive voltage of a few hundred volts
          at a time-varying frequency of a few kilohertz up to a few
          hundred kilohertz. Higher or lower voltages may be used and/or
          higher or lower frequency may be used.<br>
          <br>
          The effect of at least intermittently or periodically removing
          charged particles of one sign or polarity from the flame
          results in a charge imbalance that may be used to apply
          Coulombic forces on the combustion gas. The applied Coulombic
          forces may directly affect the movement of charged particles,
          and the charged particles, in turn, may transfer momentum to
          uncharged particles. As used herein, a "particle" may include
          an aerosol such as unburned fuel, a gas molecule, an ion,
          and/or an electron, for example. As will be described below,
          the applied Coulombic forces may be used to repel hot gas from
          temperature- sensitive surfaces, such as turbine blades,
          turbine inlet guide vanes, turbine stators, the turbine shaft,
          and/or the combustor wall.<br>
          <br>
          The electrode(s) 126 may be voltage isolated from other
          portions of the gas turbine 101 by suitable clearances (e.g.,
          "air gaps") or electrical insulators 128. A voltage source 134
          may provide the voltage to the electrode(s) 126. The voltage
          source 134 may also apply a voltage to the combustor wall 122
          and to the turbine 1 16 blades and optionally turbine shaft 1
          18 via a voltage conduction circuit 130. The voltage
          conduction circuit 130 may include one or more electrical
          insulators 128. Optionally, the voltage source 134 may provide
          different voltages to the electrode(s) 126, combustor wall
          122, and/or turbine 1 16 blades. The voltage source 134 may
          include a DC voltage source and/or a modulated voltage source.<br>
          <br>
          Optionally, the number density of ions may be increased or the
          ions may be produced by a mechanism other than the
          electrode(s) 126 acting on the combustion reaction to produce
          a majority species. Increasing the number density of ions may
          be used to increase the Coulombic forces acting on the hot
          gas. Operating by a mechanism other than the electrode(s) 126
          acting on the combustion reaction to produce a majority
          species may be used according to designer preferences.<br>
          <br>
          According to an embodiment, an electrode (optionally,
          electrode(s) 126 or a different electrode, not shown) may be
          operated at sufficient voltage to generate a corona discharge
          upstream of the turbine blades. In another embodiment, an
          additive such as one or more alkali salt(s) may be included in
          the fuel. In another embodiment, an additive such as one or
          more alkali salt(s) may be injected into the combustor 1 14.<br>
          <br>
          Approaches for producing or increasing an ion number density
          are described by Lawton and Weinberg in Electrical Aspects of
          Combustion, incorporated herein by reference. It is possible
          that alternative theories could be constructed to explain the
          conversion of Coulombic repulsion to electrostatic or
          electrodynamic acceleration of the bulk region of the fluid.
          FIG. 2 is a diagram 201 illustrating cascaded momentum
          transfer from electrostatically-repelled particles to neutral
          particles, according to an embodiment. Throughout the
          description herein, it may be assumed that voltages are either
          too low to cause dielectric breakdown (arcing) or that passive
          or active voltage control will decrease voltages under
          conditions where dielectric breakdown or incipient dielectric
          breakdown occurs. While voltages and particle charges are
          shown as positive in FIG. 2, the same effect may be seen with
          negative voltages and negative particle charges (or, as will
          be described more fully below, sign-modulated similar
          charges). Accordingly, the principles illustrated by FIG. 2
          may be applied to a system using one or more constant or
          modulated positive voltages, one or more constant or modulated
          negative voltages, or positive and negative voltages modulated
          in time. In most gas turbine systems, it may be assumed that
          each particle corresponds to a gaseous molecule, atom, or ion.<br>
          <br>
          A body, such as a turbine blade 202, may be driven to or held
          at a voltage, VT, such as a positive voltage. A film-cooling
          layer 204 may include substantially only neutral particles
          206. Neutral particles 206 may be regarded as not interacting
          with the positive voltage V Tof the body 202 (ignoring dipole
          interactions). Accordingly, the film-cooling layer 204 may be
          substantially unaffected by Coulombic forces.<br>
          <br>
          A bulk region 207, separated from the body 202 by the
          film-cooling layer 204, may include neutral particles 206 and
          charged particles 208. For purposes of description, charged
          particles 208 may be regarded as positively charged. The
          positively charged particles 208, 208a may be Coulombically
          (electrostatically) repelled by the same sign voltage V Tof
          the body 202 and may be responsively accelerated along a path
          209. The path 209 may be visualized as the positive particle
          208 "falling" through a voltage gradient caused by the voltage
          V Tof the body 202. The path 209 (e.g., the mean free path
          209) typically has a probable distance inversely proportional
          to density. The path 209 eventually intersects another
          particle 206, whereupon a collision 210 between the charged
          particle 208 and a second particle 206 causes momentum
          transfer from the charged particle 208 to the second particle
          206. For an average elastic collision (or a particular elastic
          collision of favorable orientation), momentum of the charged
          particle 208 may be halved, and the momentum of the second
          particle 206 may be increased by the same amount.<br>
          <br>
          For systems where charged particles 208 are present in low
          concentration (which corresponds to most or all embodiments
          described herein), most collisions 210 involving a charged
          particle 208 may be binary interactions between the charged
          particle 208 and a neutral particle 206. After the collision
          210, momentum transferred to the neutral particle 206 causes
          it to travel a distance near a mean free path until it
          undergoes a collision 212 with another particle after a time
          approximating a mean time between collisions. For systems
          where charged particles 208 are present in low concentration,
          most collisions 212 involving momentum transfer from a neutral
          particle 206 may be binary interactions between the first
          neutral particle 206 and a second neutral particle 206'. For
          an average elastic collision, half the momentum of the first
          neutral particle 206 may be transferred to the second neutral
          particle 206'. The first neutral particle 206 and the second
          neutral particle 206' may then travel along respective paths
          until each collides with other respective neutral particles in
          collisions 212 and momentum is again transferred. The series
          of neutral particle collisions 212 thus distribute momentum
          originally received from the charged particle 208 across a
          large number of neutral particles 206 according to an
          exponential 2 &lt;N&gt;progression in a parallel process.<br>
          <br>
          Meanwhile, the charged particle 208 is again accelerated
          responsive to Coulombic interaction with the voltage V Tof the
          body 202, and accelerates along a path to another collision
          210, whereupon the process is repeated as described above.<br>
          <br>
          According to an illustrative embodiment, charged particles 208
          may be present in the free stream (also referred to as a
          combustion gas stream) 207 at a concentration on the order of
          one to one-hundred parts per billion (ppb). According to the
          geometric momentum distribution described above, momentum may
          be transferred from one charged particle 208 to a majority of
          all particles 206, 208 in the free stream 207 in about 24 to
          30 generations of collisions 210, 212 (2 &lt;30&gt;&gt; 1 X 10
          &lt;9&gt;, 2 &lt;23&gt;&gt; 8 X 10 &lt;6&gt;). The amount of
          transferred momentum at each collision is a function of the
          voltage V Tof the body 202, the magnitude of charge carried by
          the charged particle 208, the density of the free stream 207
          (and hence the mean free path length), and the distance from
          the surface of the body 202 to the charged particle 208 at the
          point of each collision 210.<br>
          <br>
          Because Coulombic forces substantially do not act on particles
          in the film- cooling layer 204, the film-cooling layer 204
          undergoes substantially no repulsion. Moreover, the Coulombic
          repulsion acting on the charge-carrying free stream 207 may be
          viewed as producing a partial vacuum in regions between the
          surface of the charged body 202 and the free stream 207. The
          film-cooling layer 204 may thus also be viewed as being held
          in contact with the surface of the body 202 by the partial
          vacuum produced by evacuation of charged particles 208.<br>
          <br>
          Referring to FIG. 1 , an optional adhesion voltage lead 136
          may provide an adhesion voltage to an adhesion surface of the
          turbine blades. The adhesion voltage will be explained more
          fully in conjunction with FIGS. 3A, 4, 5, and 6.<br>
          <br>
          An optional counter-ion injection lead 138 may optionally
          provide charge of opposite sign to the charge imbalance in the
          gas stream, and thus allow the combustion reaction to proceed
          to completion. Optionally, the counter-ion injection lead 138
          may be configured to inject the counter-ions after the first
          stage turbine blades, between later turbine stages, or at the
          outlet end of the turbine 1 16. The counter-ion injection lead
          may produce exhaust gas that is less reactive than a charged
          gas stream, thereby reducing environmental effects of the
          system described herein. The counter-ion injection lead may
          further be used to balance charges delivered by the voltage
          source 134, and thereby reduce power consumption and/or charge
          bleed to isolated system components.<br>
          <br>
          FIG. 3A is a streamwise sectional diagram of a region 301
          including a turbine blade 302 configured for Coulombic thermal
          protection from hot combustion gases, and extended free stream
          adhesion of the gases to the surface of the turbine blade 302,
          according to an embodiment. As described above, a combustion
          gas stream 207 may at least intermittently or periodically
          include charged particles 208. The turbine blade 302 may
          include a repelling surface 304 configured to be at least
          intermittently or periodically held or driven to a repelling
          voltage V T. The repelling voltage V Tmay typically be driven
          to a voltage having the same sign as a majority of charged
          particles 208 proximate to the turbine blade 302 such that
          repulsion of the hot combustion gas stream 207 occurs
          according to a mechanism similar to that described in
          conjunction with FIG. 2, or according to another mechanism.<br>
          <br>
          A gas channel 306 may be configured to deliver film-cooling
          gas 204 adjacent to at least the repelling surface 304. For
          example, the gas channel 306 may be a first gas channel
          configured to deliver film-cooling gas through slots or holes
          308 proximate a flow forward edge 310 of the repelling surface
          304.<br>
          <br>
          Nominally, the film-cooling gas 204 and the combustion gas
          stream 207 may travel along streamlines 312 parallel to the
          surface 304 of the turbine blade 302. Because streaming is
          parallel to the surface 304, the film-cooling gas 204 and the
          combustion gas 207 may tend to not mix. Moreover, the
          repulsion of the charged particles 208 by the repelling
          voltage V Tof the repelling surface 304 may tend to prevent
          mixing of the combustion gas 207 with the film-cooling gas
          204.<br>
          <br>
          A location 314 along the surface 304 may be characterized by a
          first pressure Pi, as shown in FIG. 3A. FIG. 3B is a diagram
          showing fluid velocities and possible flow separation over the
          turbine blade of FIG. 3A, according to an embodiment.
          Referring to FIG. 3B, fluid velocity near the surface 304 at
          the location 314 corresponding to the first pressure Pi may
          follow a function represented by the velocity curve 316. The
          velocity curve 316 conforms to a requirement that velocity v
          be zero at the surface 304. Velocity v represented by the
          velocity curve 316 is positive at all points not at the
          surface 304 and asymptotically approaches the free stream
          velocity v Fat locations removed from the surface 304.
          Referring to FIG. 3A, for a lifting body such as the turbine
          blade 302, the gas pressure over the low pressure surface (top
          surface) of the turbine blade 302 may increase with distance
          along the surface 304 such that a second pressure P 2at a
          second point 318 on the low pressure surface is higher than
          the first pressure Pi at the first point 314 nearer the flow
          forward edge 310 of the turbine blade 302. In other words, Pi
          &lt; P 2.<br>
          <br>
          The system illustrated by FIGS 3A and 3B may be represented
          according to the Navier-Stokes partial differential residual:
          v dv/ds = (-1/p) dp/ds + u d &lt;2&gt;v/dy &lt;2&gt;where s is
          the streamwise axis,<br>
          <br>
          y is the normal axis,<br>
          <br>
          v is velocity along the streamwise axis,<br>
          <br>
          p is density,<br>
          <br>
          p is pressure, and<br>
          <br>
          u is a second derivative constant.<br>
          <br>
          For a case where non-streamwise velocity gradients and
          gradient curvatures are small compared to streamwise
          gradients, the equation reduces to: v dv/ds = (-1/p) dp/ds.<br>
          <br>
          In other words, the change in streamwise velocity is nonlinear
          and negative with the increase in pressure along the stream
          path. For otherwise conventional turbine blade designs (e.g.
          absent "steps"), pressure may vary monotonically and
          increasing with distance along the turbine blade 302 beyond
          the minimum pressure point.<br>
          <br>
          When dp/ds&gt;0,<br>
          <br>
          velocity v decreases as s increases. There may be conditions
          under which v is less than or equal to 0, a result of which is
          illustratively shown in FIGS. 3A and 3B. This corresponds to a
          flow separated velocity profile illustrated by a v&lt;0
          solution shown as the velocity curve 322 in FIG. 3B. For
          steady y-axis conditions, the velocity inversion in the
          velocity profile 322 may correspond to spanwise vortex
          shedding.<br>
          <br>
          For cases where P 2is sufficiently greater than Pi , the
          streamline 312 may lift off the surface 304 of the turbine
          blade 302 as indicated by a stall streamline 320. In fact, the
          streamline 320 may represent the outer edge of a region
          characterized by the spanwise vortex shedding. Such behavior
          may be referred to as an aerodynamic stall.<br>
          <br>
          Referring again to FIG. 3B, aerodynamic stall may occur when a
          velocity profile 322 includes a portion near the surface 304
          having a negative value. As shown, the velocity profile 322
          represents a flow direction reversal at a small distance from
          the surface 304 up to a magnitude of -V MAX- For comparison, a
          nominal velocity profile 316 at the location 314 is
          superimposed.<br>
          <br>
          Referring again to FIG. 3A, according to embodiments, the
          turbine blade 302 includes an adhesion surface 324 configured
          to prevent the lift-off or stall behavior 320, and instead
          substantially keep the flow 312 in contact with the upper
          surface of the turbine blade 302, as illustrated by the
          streamline 326.<br>
          <br>
          Referring to FIG. 3B, the adhesion surface 324 may act to
          create a velocity profile 328. The velocity profile 328 is
          "squished" such that velocity increases faster near the
          surface such that a measurable negative velocity is
          substantially avoided, and stall does not occur.<br>
          <br>
          The adhesion surface 324 creates the velocity profile 328 and
          the streamline 326 by reducing or reversing the repulsion
          exerted by the repelling surface 304 across at least a portion
          of the turbine blade 302. The adhesion surface 324 is
          configured to be at least intermittently or periodically held,
          driven, or in equilibrium to produce an adhesion voltage V Aor
          charge having lower magnitude than or opposite polarity from
          the repelling voltage V T.<br>
          <br>
          As described above, the repelling surface 304 may be
          configured to repel the combustion gas stream 207 by Coulombic
          repulsion. The gas channel 308 may thus deliver the
          film-cooling gas 204 to a volume adjacent to the repelling
          surface 304 between the repelling surface 304 and the
          combustion gas stream 207. The Coulonnbic repulsion of the
          combustion gas stream 207 by the repelling surface 304 may
          help to maintain the relative positions of the repelling
          surface 304, the film-cooling gas 204, and the combustion gas
          207, and thereby reduce turbine blade 302 heating and
          deterioration or failure.<br>
          <br>
          According to embodiments, the adhesion surface 324 may act to
          shield the combustion gas 207 from the repelling action of the
          repelling surface 304 at locations prone to stall 318.<br>
          <br>
          According to embodiments, the adhesion surface 324 may be
          configured as an electrical shield to shield the combustion
          gas stream 207 from the repelling voltage V Tapplied to the
          repelling surface 304 of the turbine blade 302. The adhesion
          surface 324 may provide extended flow adhesion and reduce or
          substantially eliminate flow separation, as shown by the
          alternative, non- separated stream 326 and the "squished"
          velocity profile 328.<br>
          <br>
          An electric field environment different than the electric
          field environment caused by V Tmay be formed by the adhesion
          surface 324. For example, a conductor or semiconductor of the
          adhesion surface 324 (optionally as image charge balanced
          against charges deposited on an overlying insulator) may be
          driven or otherwise carry an equilibrium or pseudo-equilibrium
          voltage or charge deposited by the ionized combustion gas 207.
          For example, the charge or voltage V Acarried by the adhesion
          surface may be normally in equilibrium with the time-averaged
          charge(s) carried by the combustion gas. According to one
          view, this may be visualized as a Faraday cage shielding the
          electric field environment corresponding to adhesion flow 326.
          A charge 208b shielded from the repulsion voltage V Tand/or
          responsive to an adhesion voltage V Amay "feel" less Coulombic
          acceleration away from the surface 304 than the acceleration
          felt by charges 208a operatively coupled to the repulsion
          voltage V T.<br>
          <br>
          According to an embodiment, the adhesion surface 324 may be
          configured to be in charge equilibrium or pseudo-equilibrium
          with the charged combustion gas stream 207 such that the
          adhesion surface 324 is charged to an adhesion voltage V
          Ahaving an average value lower in magnitude than an average of
          the turbine blade 302 repelling voltage V T. For example, at
          least one of the sign of the charged particles 208 or the
          concentration of the charged particles 208 in the combustion
          gas 207 may be modulated responsive to modulation of voltage
          of the electrode(s) by the voltage source (FIG. 1 , 126, 134)
          according to a desired equilibrium or pseudo-equilibrium
          voltage.<br>
          <br>
          According to other embodiments, the adhesion surface 324 may
          be driven to or held at an adhesion voltage V Aopposite in
          polarity from the repelling voltage V Tof the repelling
          surface 304. Referring to FIG. 1 , the voltage source 134 may
          apply such an attraction voltage to the adhesion surface 324.
          A charged particle 208b proximate the adhesion surface 324 may
          be intermittently or periodically attracted to or receive a
          reduced repulsion from an adhesion voltage V A. For example,
          the adhesion voltage V Amay be at ground, may be opposite in
          sign (polarity) from the charged particle 208b, or as
          described above, at a reduced magnitude compared to the
          repelling voltage V T.<br>
          <br>
          According to an embodiment, the adhesion voltage V Amay be
          modulated in phase with a variation in passing charged
          particle 208 concentration and/or sign. The phase may
          optionally be selected responsive to mass flow rate, fuel burn
          rate, and/or flow velocity of the combustion gas 207.
          According to another embodiment, the adhesion voltage V Amay
          follow a phase-delayed varying equilibrium with a
          concentration and/or sign of passing charged particles 208.<br>
          <br>
          FIG. 4 illustrates an embodiment 401 from an A-A view
          illustrated on<br>
          <br>
          FIG. 3A including an adhesion surface 324 having a spanwise
          varying adhesion surface coupling efficiency, charge/voltage,
          or area. Areas 402 may be extended into or past regions of the
          adhesion surface 324. The areas 402 may be an extension of the
          repelling surface 304, for example. A reduced repelling force
          and/or increased attracting (adhesion) force felt by a charge
          208a when proximate the adhesion surface 324 in combination
          with repelling force felt by a charge 208 may tend to cause a
          spanwise acceleration variation that is conducive to forming
          streamwise vortices 404. Streamwise vortices may tend to have
          desirable aerodynamic effects compared to spanwise vortices.<br>
          <br>
          Various physical embodiments of the adhesion surface 324 are
          contemplated. According to embodiments, the adhesion surface
          324 may be configured to apply at least reduced Coulonnbic
          repulsion on the combustion gas stream 207 compared to the
          repelling surface 304. As illustrated in FIGS. 4-6, the
          adhesion surface 324 may include a spanwise variation in
          applied voltage, charge, or area configured to promote
          streamwise vortex 404 generation.<br>
          <br>
          According to an embodiment, the adhesion surface 324 may be
          configured to apply Coulombic attraction to the combustion gas
          stream 207. For example, a gas turbine 101 (FIG. 1 ) may
          include a voltage source 134<br>
          <br>
          operatively coupled to the adhesion surface 324 and configured
          to provide an adhesion voltage to the adhesion surface 324.
          The turbine blade 302 may include an electrical lead (not
          shown) operatively coupled to the adhesion surface 324, the
          electrical lead being configured to conduct a voltage to at
          least a portion of the adhesion surface 324. The electrical
          lead may receive the adhesion voltage from the voltage source
          134.<br>
          <br>
          The adhesion surface 324 may be shaped to occupy a void 406
          defined by the repelling surface 304. The adhesion surface 324
          may include an electrical insulator 408 adjacent to one or
          more voids 406 defined by the repelling surface 304. An
          electrical conductor or semiconductor 410, operable as an
          adhesion electrode, may be disposed adjacent to the electrical
          insulator 408. For example, the electrical conductor or
          semiconductor (adhesion electrode) 410 may be disposed in a
          recess or void 412 defined by the electrically insulating
          material 408. A second electrical insulator or semiconductor
          portion 408 may be disposed over the electrical conductor or
          semiconductor 410 forming the adhesion electrode. In such an
          arrangement, the adhesion electrode 410 may be referred to as
          "buried". According to other embodiments, the adhesion
          electrode 410 may be exposed.<br>
          <br>
          The adhesion surface 324 may comprise at least a flow rearward
          portion 330 of a low pressure side of the turbine blade 302.
          The repelling surface 304 may include substantially the
          remainder of the surface of the turbine blade 302. According
          to embodiments, the repelling surface 304 may include at least
          a flow forward portion of a low pressure side of the turbine
          blade 302 and at least a portion of a high pressure side of
          the turbine blade 302. Referring to FIGS. 1 and 2, the voltage
          source 134 may be configured to cause modulation of at least
          one of a sign or concentration of charged particles 208 in the
          combustion gas stream 207. The voltage source 134 may be
          configured to select the modulation to cause a selected
          equilibrium voltage carried by the adhesion surface 324. The
          voltage source may optionally be configured to apply a
          substantially constant or modulated adhesion voltage to the
          adhesion surface 324 of the turbine blade 302.<br>
          <br>
          Referring again to FIG. 4, the adhesion surface 324 may
          include a "buried" adhesion electrode 410, wherein the
          insulator 408 covers the conductor or semiconductor forming
          the adhesion electrode 410. According to other embodiments,
          the adhesion electrode 410 may include an exposed upper
          surface (as shown in FIG. 3A).<br>
          <br>
          According to embodiments, tantalum (Ta) may form at least a
          portion or alloy of the adhesion electrode 410. Tantalum may
          be advantageous due to its relatively high electrical opacity.<br>
          <br>
          As described above, the adhesion surface 324 may include a
          spanwise variation in area with regions having relatively high
          area and regions having relatively low area. According to
          other embodiments, the adhesion surface 324 may be configured
          to support a spanwise variation in applied voltage or charge,
          or a spanwise variation in coupling efficiency to the
          combustion gas 207.<br>
          <br>
          Various arrangements are contemplated. FIG. 5 is a span-wise
          B-B view of portions of a repelling surface 304 and an
          adhesion surface 324 of the turbine blade of FIGS. 3A and 4,
          according to an embodiment wherein the adhesion surface 324
          has a spanwise variation in area. FIG. 6 is a span-wise B-B
          view of a portion of the turbine blade of FIGS. 3A and 4
          according to another embodiment wherein the adhesion surface
          324 has a spanwise variation in area. The spanwise variations
          in area depicted in FIGS. 5 and 6 may also help analogously
          describe the effect of a spanwise variation in voltage,
          charge, and/or coupling efficiency.<br>
          <br>
          FIG. 5 illustrates an embodiment 501 wherein the area of the
          adhesion surface 324 is varied spanwise by a serpentine
          variation in the position of the adhesion surface 324 leading
          edge. A void may be machined in the surface 304 of the turbine
          blade 302, and an insulator 408 applied therein. A void may
          then be machined in the insulator 408 surface and an adhesion
          electrode 410 disposed in the insulator void.<br>
          <br>
          Streamlines superimposed over the adhesion surface indicate
          relative combustion gas flow over the turbine blade surface.
          Streamwise vortices 404 may be set up by a difference between
          repulsion of the charged particles 208 from the repelling
          surface 304 and the adhesion electrode 410.<br>
          <br>
          FIG. 6 illustrates an alternative embodiment wherein the
          leading edge of the adhesion electrode 410 is not varied, but
          wherein a plurality of discontinuous regions of repelling
          surface 304 are arranged to potentiate the formation of
          streamwise vortices 404. According to other embodiments (not
          shown), the adhesion surface and/or the adhesion electrode 410
          may include a plurality of discontinuous regions.<br>
