      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</b><br>
      <br>
      [0011] In the following detailed description, reference is made to
      the accompanying drawings, which form a part hereof. In the
      drawings, similar symbols typically identify similar components,
      unless context dictates otherwise. The illustrative embodiments
      described in the detailed description, drawings, and claims are
      not meant to be limiting. Other embodiments may be utilized, and
      other changes may be made, without departing from the spirit or
      scope of the subject matter presented here.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] FIG. 1 is a diagram showing a burner 102 configured to
      support a flame 106 and a cooled electrode system 101 for the
      burner 102, according to an embodiment. The electrode system 101
      for the burner 102 may include a thermally coupled electrode 104
      configured to apply an electric field or eject
      electrically-charged ions to a region corresponding to the flame
      106 or combustion gas 108 produced by the flame 106. The thermally
      coupled electrode 104 may receive heat from the flame 106 and/or
      the combustion gas 108. A cooling apparatus 110 may be operatively
      coupled to the thermally coupled electrode 104 and configured to
      remove the heat received by the electrode 104 from the flame 106
      or the combustion gas 108.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] A volume in which the flame 106 and combustion gases 108
      are at least transiently held may be referred to as a combustion
      volume 111. The electrode 104 may be disposed at least partially
      within the combustion volume 111 to receive the heat from the
      flame 106 and/or the combustion gas 108. Alternatively, the
      electrode 104 may be outside the combustion volume 111, but
      thermally coupled to the flame 106 or the combustion gas 108 to
      receive heat therefrom.<br>
      <br>
      [0014] The electrode 104 and cooling apparatus 110 are shown in
      block diagram form. Their physical form and location may vary from
      what may be indicated in FIG. 1. As will be appreciated from the
      description below, the cooling apparatus 110 may be disposed
      substantially within the electrode 104, may be adjacent to the
      electrode 104, and/or may include relatively extensive apparatus
      separated from the electrode 104.<br>
      <br>
      [0015] According to an embodiment, at least a majority of heat
      removed by the cooling apparatus 110 from the thermally coupled
      electrode 104 may correspond to heat received from the flame 106
      and/or combustion gas 108 produced by the flame 106. Additionally
      or alternatively, heat removed by the cooling apparatus 110 from
      the thermally coupled electrode 104 may include heat caused by
      dissipation from electrical modulation of the thermally coupled
      electrode 104 and heat received from the flame 106. Optionally,
      the burner and electrode system 101 may include a plurality of
      thermally coupled electrodes 104 and/or additional non-thermally
      coupled electrode(s) (not shown).<br>
      <br>
      [0016] The burner 102 may include a fuel source 112 configured to
      provide fuel for the flame 106 and an oxidizer source 116
      configured to provide oxidizer for the flame 106. Electrical
      isolation 114 may be configured to electrically isolate the fuel
      source 112 from ground or voltages other than voltages
      corresponding to the thermally coupled electrode 104.<br>
      <br>
      [0017] An electrode controller 118 may be configured to apply a
      voltage corresponding to the electric field to the thermally
      coupled electrode 104 through one or more electrical leads 120.
      The electrode controller 118 may include a waveform generator 122
      and an amplifier 124. The waveform generator 122 may be configured
      to provide a time-varying voltage. The time varying voltage may be
      at least partially periodic and may have a frequency between about
      50 Hz and 10 kHz, for example. The amplifier 124 may amplify the
      time varying voltage received from the waveform generator 122 to a
      working voltage. The working voltage may be conveyed to the
      thermally coupled electrode 104 by the one or more electrical
      leads 120. The working voltage may range between about ±1000 V
      (e.g., as a time varying voltage formed as a sinusoid or a square
      wave that cycles between +1 kV and -1 kV) to about ±500,000 V
      (±500 kV). Experiments were run by the inventors using voltages
      between ±4 kV and ±40 kV. Typically, current dissipated by the
      electrode(s) 104 is low -- for example, 50 milliamperes or less.
      Accordingly, the electrode(s) 104 do not typically undergo any
      significant Joule heating responsive to the applied amplified
      electrical waveform. Rather, a majority to substantially all of
      the heat removed by cooling may be attributed to radiant and/or
      convective heat transfer from the flame 106 or the combustion gas
      108 to the electrode 104.<br>
      <br>
      [0018] The cooling apparatus 110 may be operatively coupled to and
      controlled by the electrode controller 118. Alternatively, the
      cooling apparatus 110 may be not controlled by the electrode
      controller 118. The block diagram connection 126 shown in FIG. 1
      between the electrode controller 118 and the cooling apparatus 110
      may be omitted when there is no operative coupling between the
      cooling apparatus 110 and the electrode controller 118.<br>
      <br>
      [0019] A heat sink (not shown) may be operatively coupled to the
      cooling apparatus 110 and configured to receive the heat received
      by the thermally coupled electrode 104 from the flame 106 or the
      combustion gas 108, and removed from the thermally coupled
      electrode 104 by the cooling apparatus 110. For example, the
      cooling apparatus 110 may be configured to output heat from the
      thermally coupled electrode 104 to a heat sink (not shown)
      including a heat exchange surface (not shown) configured to
      pre-heat an oxidizer 116 or gas fed to the flame 106. For example,
      the oxidizer 116 may include oxygen carried in air. The heat sink
      (not shown) may include fins configured to pre-heat the air before
      the air flows into and past the flame 106.<br>
      <br>
      [0020] Alternatively or additionally, the cooling apparatus 110
      may be configured to output heat from the thermally coupled
      electrode 104 to a heat sink (not shown) including a heat exchange
      surface (not shown) configured to pre-heat fuel fed to the flame
      106. For example, the heat sink (not shown) may include fins (not
      shown) disposed along a non-conductive portion 114 of a fuel
      supply tube. Such a heat sink and fins (not shown) may be formed,
      for example, by embedding the heat sink and/or fins in a cast fuel
      supply tube 114 or by co-molding the heat sink and/or fins in a
      thermoplastic fuel supply tube 114. Additionally or alternatively,
      the heat sink (not shown) may be formed as a conductive portion
      112 of the fuel supply. This arrangement may be especially
      suitable for gaseous fuels.<br>
      <br>
      [0021] According to another example, the heat sink (not shown) may
      be configured to be at least partially immersed in a liquid fuel,
      such as heating oil or bunker fuel. According to an embodiment,
      the heat sink (not shown) may be configured as at least a portion
      of a fuel intake mechanism (not shown) that pre-heats the liquid
      fuel for easier pumping and passage through a nozzle 112. This
      arrangement may be especially suitable for a viscous fuel such as
      bunker fuel.<br>
      <br>
      [0022] The cooling apparatus 110 may be configured to output heat
      from the thermally coupled electrode 104 to a combustion volume
      111 corresponding to the flame 106 or the combustion gas 108. For
      example, the cooling apparatus 110 may include a forced or natural
      convection system (not shown) configured to pass overfire air
      through a hollow thermally coupled electrode 104. The overfire air
      may pass through the electrode and out an orifice (such as an open
      end of the electrode, for example) at an overfire air injection
      location. In this case, the overfire air (or other fluid passing
      through the thermally coupled electrode 104) may itself act as the
      heat sink. This approach is described more fully in conjunction
      with FIG. 4 below.<br>
      <br>
      [0023] The cooling apparatus 110 may be configured to output heat
      from the thermally coupled electrode 104 to a liquid, gas, or
      solid heat sink (not shown) that is not thermally coupled to the
      flame 106 or the combustion gas 108. For example, the liquid, gas,
      or solid heat sink may be electrically isolated from a secondary
      coolant (not shown) configured to remove the heat from the heat
      sink.<br>
      <br>
      [0024] According to an embodiment, an electrical isolation system
      (not shown) may be configured to reduce or substantially prevent
      current leakage from the thermally coupled electrode 104 to a heat
      sink (not shown) configured to receive heat removed from the
      thermally coupled electrode by the cooling apparatus 110.<br>
      <br>
      [0025] Various types of cooling apparatuses 110 are contemplated.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] FIG. 2 is a diagram 201 showing the thermally coupled
      electrode of FIG. 1 with a thermo-electric cooler 202 configured
      and operatively coupled to remove the heat from the thermally
      coupled electrode 104, according to an embodiment. Thermo-electric
      coolers may typically operate according to the Peltier effect.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] According to embodiments, the thermally coupled electrode
      104 may be configured to be fluid cooled. Fluid cooling may take
      several forms including gas cooling, liquid cooling, phase change
      cooling; open and closed tips (respectively allowing and not
      allowing the fluid to be launched toward the flame 106); and/or
      with various heat sinking approaches. Generally speaking, a common
      theme may include electrical isolation of the electrode with
      respect to external fluid systems and/or with respect to grounding
      to the burner 102 and associated apparatuses. Electrode isolation
      may be intrinsic in the case of a non-conducting heat sink such as
      combustion air, or may include relatively sophisticated isolation
      approaches.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] FIG. 3 is a diagram showing the thermally coupled electrode
      104 of FIG. 1 with a cooling apparatus 110 including a heat pipe
      302, according to an embodiment. The heat pipe 302 may be
      configured to receive heat from the flame 106 via evaporation at
      an evaporator end 304 and output the heat from the flame via
      condensation at a condenser end 306. Heat pipes are self-contained
      coolers that do not receive any power input or fluid flow from an
      outside source. At the evaporator 304, a liquid form of the
      working fluid in contact with a thermally conductive solid surface
      312 turns into a vapor by absorbing heat from the surface. The
      vapor form of the working fluid traverses the length of the heat
      pipe (or depth of the heat pipe, depending on the particular
      physical form of the electrode 104) through a vapor space 308 to
      the condenser 306. At the condenser 306, the vapor condenses back
      into the liquid, releasing the latent heat that was absorbed at
      the evaporator 304. The liquid then returns to the evaporator 304
      through either capillary action or gravity action where it
      evaporates once more and repeats the cycle. Typically, the liquid
      returns from the condenser to the evaporator via a wicking layer
      310 adjacent to the vapor space 308.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] According to an embodiment, a wall 312 of the heat pipe 302
      may form an electrically conductive path of the electrode 104. The
      electrode 104 and the heat pipe 302 may include an electrical lug
      314 configured for operative coupling to the electrode lead 120
      from the electrode controller 118. The electrode 104 and the heat
      pipe 302 may also include an electrically insulating coating 316
      configured to reduce or prevent communication of the voltage
      placed on the electrode 104 to ground, to another voltage, or to
      an electrically conductive cooling fluid received from a cooling
      fluid inlet 320 and output to a cooling fluid outlet 322. The wall
      312 of the heat pipe may include one or more smooth contours 318
      configured to reduce or prevent charge concentration and arcing to
      or through the flame 106.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] FIG. 4 is a diagram showing the thermally coupled electrode
      104 of FIG. 1, wherein the electrode 104 includes a flow channel
      404 for a cooling fluid and an aperture 322 for outputting the
      heated cooling fluid to the flame 106 or combustion gas, according
      to an embodiment. The thermally coupled electrode 104, 401 may
      include a wall 402 forming an electrical conductor and defining a
      fluid flow channel 404 and at least one aperture 322 formed in the
      wall 402. The fluid flow channel 404 may be configured to convey a
      cooling fluid from a cooling fluid inlet 408 to the aperture 322
      to transfer heat from the wall 402 to the cooling fluid and to
      output the heated cooling fluid to the flame 106 or to combustion
      gas 108 produced by the flame.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] An electrical lug 314 may be configured for operative
      coupling between the electrically conductive wall 402 and the
      electrode lead 120 from the electrode controller 118. An
      electrically insulating coupling 410 to the fluid flow channel 404
      may be configured to reduce or prevent communication of the
      voltage placed on the electrode 104 to ground, to another voltage,
      or to an electrically conductive secondary cooling fluid (not
      shown).<br>
      <br>
      [0032] The wall 402 may include one or more smooth contours 318
      configured to reduce or prevent charge concentration and arcing to
      or through the flame 106. Optionally, an electrically insulating
      coating 412 may be formed over at least a portion of the wall 402
      adjacent to the flow channel 404 to reduce or eliminate current
      flow to the cooling fluid.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] The cooling fluid may include a gas such as air. For
      example, the aperture 322 may form an overtire air port. According
      to other embodiments, the cooling fluid may include a liquid.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] FIG. 5 is a diagram showing the electrode 104 of FIG. 1,
      wherein the electrode 104 includes first and second fluid flow
      channels 504, 506 for carrying a cooling fluid through the
      electrode 104, according to an embodiment. A wall 502 may define
      an electrical conductor for carrying electrode voltage. A first
      fluid flow channel 504 may be formed within the wall 502 and may
      be configured to convey received cooling fluid. A second fluid
      flow channel 506 may be formed within the wall and may be
      configured to convey output cooling fluid.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] The fluid flow channels 504, 506 may be configured to
      respectively convey the cooling fluid at least a portion of a flow
      distance from a cooling fluid inlet port 508 to a cooling fluid
      outlet port 510. At least one of the fluid flow channels 504, 506
      may be configured to transfer heat from the wall 502 to the
      cooling fluid. At least one fitting 512 may be configured to
      couple the fluid flow channels 504, 506 respectively to the
      cooling fluid inlet port 508 and the cooling fluid outlet port
      510. The fitting 512 may form the cooling fluid inlet port 508 and
      the cooling fluid outlet port 510. The at least one fitting 512
      may be substantially electrically insulating.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] The fluid flow channels (e.g., 504, 506) may be arranged in
      various ways. For example, the fluid flow channels 504, 506 may be
      coaxial. A tube or integrally formed wall 514 may define the inner
      flow channel 506. The indicated flow directions may be reversed.
      Alternatively, the fluid flow channels may include parallel lumens
      that are not coaxial.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] An electrical lug 314 may be configured for operative
      coupling between the electrically conductive wall 502 to the
      electrode lead 120, for coupling the electrode 104 to the
      electrode controller 118.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] The cooling fluid may be electrically conductive or
      electrically non-conductive. According to embodiments, the cooling
      fluid may include a gas such as air or a gaseous fuel. In other
      embodiments, the cooling fluid may be electrically conductive or
      potentially electrically conductive. The cooling fluid may include
      a liquid such as water or a liquid fuel.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] Some cooling fluids, such as water and/or some fuels, may
      be at least partially electrically conductive. Other cooling
      fluids, such as air that may carry humidity or insulating oil that
      may contain water, may be potentially conductive. As described
      above, relatively high voltages may be placed on the electrode
      104. Accordingly, it may be advisable at least in some
      embodiments, to ensure electrical isolation of the electrode 104
      from a cooling fluid or to ensure electrical isolation of the
      cooling fluid from ground or other voltages.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] According to an embodiment, an electrically insulating
      coating 412 may be formed over at least a portion of surfaces of
      the wall 502 or walls 502, 514 defining the fluid flow channels
      504, 506. The electrically insulating coating 412 may be
      configured to reduce or eliminate current flow to the cooling
      fluid. For example, the electrically insulating coating may
      include a ceramic coating. For example, the electrically
      insulating coating may include a glass formed by crosslinking a
      silane to form silicone and pyrolyzing the silicone.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] As indicated above, some cooling fluids may be electrically
      conductive or at least potentially electrically conductive. Even
      in cases where electrical conductivity is not anticipated, it may
      be desirable to provide one or more extra levels of electrical
      isolation such as for fail-safe protection.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] FIG. 6 is a diagram showing an electrically isolated
      cooling fluid source 601 configured to provide a cooling fluid to
      a thermally coupled electrode 104, according to an embodiment. An
      electrically insulating tank or pool 602 may be configured to hold
      a reservoir of cooling fluid 604. A cooling fluid supply system
      606 may be configured to convey the cooling fluid from the
      reservoir 602 of cooling fluid 604 to a cooling fluid inlet 320,
      408, 508 (respectively seen in FIGS. 3-5) operatively coupled to
      the thermally coupled electrode 104. The electrically isolated or
      electrically insulating cooling fluid supply system 601 may
      include an electrically isolated or electrically isolating pump
      608 configured pump the cooling fluid. Additionally or
      alternatively, the electrically isolated or electrically
      insulating cooling fluid supply system 601 may be configured to
      deliver the cooling fluid responsive to a thermal siphon.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] A return line 610 may be configured to return heated
      cooling fluid from the cooling fluid outlet port 322, 510 (see
      FIGS. 3 and 5).<br>
      <br>
      [0044] A cooling fluid supply 612 may be configured to provide
      cooling fluid to the electrically insulating tank or pool 602
      through an antisiphon arrangement 614 configured to prevent
      electrical conduction to the fluid supply 612. The electrically
      isolated cooling fluid source 601 may include a valve 616
      configured to cause the cooling fluid to be supplied across the
      antisiphon arrangement 614 in a non-continuous stream that
      prevents electrical conduction from the cooling fluid reservoir
      604 to the cooling fluid supply 612.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] A secondary coolant tank 618 may be configured to hold a
      secondary coolant 620. The secondary coolant 620 may be arranged
      to receive heat from the cooling fluid reservoir 604 through the
      electrically insulating tank or pool 602.<br>
      <br>
      [0046] FIG. 7 is a flowchart illustrating a method 701 for cooling
      an electrode subject to heating by a flame or a combustion gas
      produced by the flame, according to an embodiment. In step 704 an
      electric field may be applied to a flame or combustion gas
      produced by the flame with an electrode. Proceeding to step 706,
      the electric field may cause a detectable response in the flame or
      the combustion gas. As described elsewhere herein, it may be
      desirable or necessary to place the electrode where, in step 708,
      the electrode receives heat from the flame or the combustion.
      Proceeding to step 712, the electrode may be cooled to remove the
      heat received from the flame or the combustion gas.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] According to some embodiments, a step (not shown) of
      generating heat in the electrode by Joule heating may be included.
      However, under such cases, the majority of heat removed by cooling
      in step 712 typically corresponds to heat received from the flame.
      In many if not all cases, substantially all the heat removed by
      cooling corresponds to heat received from the flame.<br>
      <br>
      [0048] The method 701 may include supplying fuel and an oxidizer
      to a burner (not shown) and supporting the flame with the burner
      (not shown). For example, an electrode system including at least
      one thermally coupled electrode may be integrated with or sold
      with a burner such that a single vendor product performs these
      additional steps. In other cases, different vendors may supply the
      electrode system and the burner.<br>
      <br>
      [0049] The method 701 may further include electrically isolating
      the fuel source from ground or voltages other than voltages
      corresponding to the electrode (not shown).<br>
      <br>
      [0050] The method 701 may include step 702, wherein a time-varying
      voltage to the electrode. Step 702 may include generating a
      waveform with a waveform generator and amplifying the waveform to
      the time-varying voltage. The time-varying voltage applied to the
      electrode corresponds to the electric field applied to the flame
      or the combustion gas. The waveform and an amount of amplification
      applied to the waveform may be selected to cause the detectable
      response in the flame or the combustion gas. According to
      embodiments, the waveform and the time-varying voltage are
      selected not to cause Joule heating of the electrode. The waveform
      and the time-varying voltage may be selected to avoid causing
      arcing between the flame or other structures and the electrode;
      and to cause no inductive or resistive heating of the flame or the
      combustion gas.<br>
      <br>
      [0051] Optionally, the method 701 may include controlling a
      cooling apparatus operatively coupled to the electrode with a
      controller that also generates the waveform for the electrode.<br>
      <br>
      [0052] Cooling the electrode in step 712 may include operating a
      thermo-electric cooler.<br>
      <br>
      [0053] Optionally, the method 701 may include step 710, including
      providing at least one of an electrically isolating cooling fluid
      or an electrically isolated heat sink to receive heat from the
      electrode. Step 710 may include transferring the heat to the
      electrically isolating cooling fluid or electrically isolated heat
      sink. For example, providing an electrically isolating cooling
      fluid or heat sink may include providing an electrically
      non-conducting gas. Providing the electrically non-conducting gas
      may include providing primary air or oxidizer for the flame.
      Transferring the heat to the electrically isolating cooling fluid
      in step 710 may include preheating the primary air or oxidizer
      with the heat removed from the electrode before mixing with a fuel
      or the flame. Additionally or alternatively, providing the
      electrically non-conducting gas may include providing overfire air
      or oxidizer for the flame. Transferring the heat to the
      electrically isolating cooling fluid may include preheating the
      overfire air or oxidizer with the heat removed from the electrode.
      The preheated overfire air or oxidizer may be injected into the
      flame or the combustion gas. For example, this approach may be
      used in conjunction with an electrode formed to correspond to the
      diagram of FIG. 4.<br>
      <br>
      [0054] Additionally or alternatively, preheating the overfire air
      or oxidizer with heat removed from the electrode may include
      passing the overfire air or oxidizer through one or more lumens
      formed in the electrode and convectively receiving the heat into
      the overfire air or oxidizer from one or more walls of the one or
      more lumens. Injecting the preheated air or oxidizer into the
      flame or the combustion gas may include passing the convectively
      heated air or oxidizer from the one or more lumens through one or
      more apertures formed in the electrode and into the flame or
      combustion gas. Providing the electrically non-conductive gas may
      include providing atmospheric air.<br>
      <br>
      [0055] Transferring the heat to the electrically isolating cooling
      fluid in step 712 may include transferring heat from the heat sink
      to the electrically non-conductive gas through cooling fins.<br>
      <br>
      [0056] Optionally, providing an electrically isolating cooling
      fluid or heat sink in step 710 may include providing an
      electrically non-conductive liquid coolant. For example, providing
      a non-conductive liquid coolant may include providing a liquid
      fuel. Transferring the heat to the electrically isolating cooling
      fluid in step 712 may include transferring the heat to the liquid
      fuel to preheat the liquid fuel. The method 701 may include
      conveying the preheated liquid fuel to a burner and fueling the
      flame with the preheated liquid fuel.<br>
      <br>
      [0057] Alternatively, step 710 may include providing an
      electrically conductive liquid coolant and electrically isolating
      the electrically conductive liquid coolant from ground and from
      voltages other than a voltage applied to the electrode. For
      example, providing the electrically conductive liquid fuel may
      include providing an electrically conductive liquid fuel, water,
      or a liquid metal. The method 701 may then include transferring
      heat from the electrically conductive liquid coolant to a
      secondary coolant or heat sink through an electrically
      non-conductive wall, heat exchanger, or tank (for example, see the
      block diagram of FIG. 6). Providing the electrically isolating
      cooling fluid or an electrically isolated heat sink in step 710
      may include pumping the electrically conductive liquid coolant
      from an electrically isolating coolant reservoir and past a heat
      sink operatively coupled to the electrode. Additionally or
      alternatively, providing the electrically isolating cooling fluid
      or an electrically isolated heat sink in step 710 may include
      pumping the electrically conductive liquid coolant from an
      electrically isolating coolant reservoir and or through at least
      one fluid channel in the electrode. Electrically isolating the
      electrically conductive liquid coolant may further include
      providing a pump that is electrically isolating or electrically
      isolating the pump from a pump drive motor. For example, a
      peristaltic pump may be electrically isolating by using a
      non-conductive flexible tube to carry the liquid through the pump.
      Alternatively, a vane, centrifugal, positive displacement, or
      other pump may be electrically isolated from the pump drive motor
      by cutting a conductive shaft, and providing power transmission
      between ends of the conductive shaft through an insulating
      universal joint or shaft.<br>
      <br>
      [0058] Electrically isolating the electrically conductive liquid
      coolant from ground and from voltages other than a voltage applied
      to the electrode may include providing the electrically conductive
      liquid coolant to a reservoir from a cooling fluid supply through
      an antisiphon arrangement that prevents electrical conduction
      between the fluid supply and the reservoir. For example, providing
      the electrically conductive liquid coolant to the reservoir from
      the cooling fluid supply through an antisiphon arrangement that
      prevents electrical conduction may include modulating a liquid
      coolant flow to prevent a continuous stream of the electrically
      conductive liquid coolant from bridging the antisiphon
      arrangement.<br>
      <br>
      [0059] Additionally or alternatively, electrical isolation may be
      provided intrinsic to or in conjunction with the electrode. For
      example, an electrical insulator may be provided between the
      electrode and one or more cooling fluid flow channels. For
      example, see FIG. 3, 316, FIG. 4, 412, or FIG. 5, 412.<br>
      <br>
      [0060] Step 712 may be performed in a range of ways described
      above in conjunction with apparatus diagrams. For example, cooling
      the electrode to remove heat received from the flame may include
      passing a cooling fluid through the electrode. Additionally or
      alternatively, cooling the electrode to remove heat received from
      the flame may include operating a heat pipe to remove the heat
      from the electrode. Heat from the heat pipe may be transferred to
      a cooling fluid. For example, transferring heat from the heat pipe
      to the cooling fluid may include passing primary combustion
      oxidizer, overfire oxidizer, or fuel across a condenser portion of
      the heat pipe to preheat the primary combustion oxidizer, overfire
      oxidizer, or fuel. Electrical insulation (e.g., FIG. 3, 316) may
      be provided over at least a condenser portion of the heat pipe to
      prevent conduction of an electrode voltage to a cooling fluid
      passing across the condenser.<br>
      <br>
      [0061] Other approaches may also be used to cool a thermally
      coupled electrode and may fall within the scope of claims. Phase
      change materials that absorb heat during phase change may be
      circulated through a thermally coupled electrode or may be
      positioned in a solid form to respond to transients in heat input
      from the flame or hot gas. For example, certain metal alloys or
      salt mixtures (eutectics) may additionally or alternatively be
      used to provide at least temporary protection of the electrode
      104. For example, Pb/Sn solder is a eutectic mixture that melts at
      360 F or so. Eutectic mixtures may be provided for nearly any
      temperature using salts; e.g., between about 200 and 1600 F. One
      or more cavities in the electrode 104 may be filed with a eutectic
      mixture to provide passive overheat protection, at least for a
      time, because a melting salt maintains its melting point or melt
      range temperature until the last bit of salt is liquefied. The
      heat of fusion of a eutectic cavity may provide a substantial heat
      sink to protect a thermally coupled electrode 104, in the event of
      failure of a cooling apparatus, or in lieu of a separate cooling
      apparatus.<br>
      <br>
      [0062] According to an embodiment, a eutectic may be circulated,
      such as in slurry form. One may also use a liquid/vapor
      equilibrium to provide overtemperature protection. According to an
      embodiment, a liquid may be adulterated to form a range of
      vaporization temperatures between a bubble point and a dew point
      rather than a single boiling point. If the electrode receives
      sufficient heat from the flame or combustion gas to reach a
      boiling point or boiling range of a circulated coolant, additional
      heat of vaporization may provide higher heat transfer rates than
      can be provided by a liquid responding only with a sensible
      temperature rise.<br>
      <br>
      [0063] In circulated coolant systems, the circulation may
      optionally be passive, requiring no pumps or other moving parts.
      For example, in a system where the cooled phase is more dense, an
      upper end of a sealed tube containing a eutectic may be allowed to
      exchange heat with an ambient environment while a lower end of the
      sealed tube exchanges heat with the furnace. In this case, the
      device may circulate the cooler dense phase to the high
      temperature region and the hotter less dense phase to the cooling
      region. This approach may be used in the form of a heat pipe, such
      as the cooling system illustrated by FIG. 3, for example. By using
      materials with juxtaposed densities (e.g., bismuth etc.), the tube
      may work in the opposite orientation.<br>
