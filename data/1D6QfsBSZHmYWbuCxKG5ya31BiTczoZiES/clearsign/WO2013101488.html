      A gas turbine is configured to operate with a high temperature
      combustion gas stream. The gas turbine may include a combustor
      that provides a combustion gas stream including charged particles
      and at least one turbine stage including at least one high
      temperature surface that may be driven with a voltage selected to
      repel the charged particles. The at least one high temperature
      surface may output a film-cooling layer including cool air, the
      film-cooling layer being stabilized by Coulombic forces between
      the voltage and the charged particles.<br>

      disclosure herein, is incorporated by reference.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Gas turbines, which (for example) are used in terrestrial power
      generation and jet/propjet aircraft propulsion, may burn fuel
      having an adiabatic flame temperature greater than the melting or
      softening point of parts such as turbine blades, turbine inlet
      guide vanes, turbine stators, turbine shaft, combustor walls,
      and/or other parts to which hot combustion products are exposed;
      and which may be individually or collectively referred to as (a)
      high temperature surface(s). Various approaches have been used to
      address this apparent barrier. For example, development of high
      temperature alloys has historically represented significant
      research emphasis. Air cooling has been used in various forms to
      provide convective heat transfer from heated surfaces.<br>
      <br>
      While air cooling of some gas turbine parts has resulted in
      increases in allowable combustion gas temperature, achievable
      increases in temperature have been limited and generally do not
      allow for operation at full adiabatic flame temperature. For
      example, surface cooling has been less than optimal because
      cooling effects have been limited to small radii surrounding
      surface-penetrating fluid passages. For example, in turbine blade
      cooling applications, cooling air exits surface-penetrating
      cooling holes at relatively high velocity. While providing
      convective cooling to the inner diameter of the cooling holes
      themselves, the high velocity air also tends to disturb flow over
      the surface of the turbine blade, ultimately causing vortices that
      can bring hot combustion gases into contact with turbine blade
      surfaces peripheral to the cooling holes.<br>
      <br>
      Combustion gas dilution and/or other stoichiometric imbalances
      have been used to reduce the temperature of combustion gases.
      Unfortunately, gas turbine thermodynamic efficiency is negatively
      affected by dilution the heat source with cooling air, because
      cooling air lowers the peak cycle temperature of the heat engine.<br>
      <br>
      Thermodynamic efficiency may be expressed as a function of the
      ratio of heat source temperature to heatsink temperature. The
      heatsink temperature may be very close to or substantially equal
      to ambient air temperature (effective heat sink temperature may be
      influenced by flow losses). The heat source temperature has
      typically been limited, not by adiabatic flame temperature, but by
      material property limitations (as described above). Dilution of
      the combustion gases, and corresponding decrease in heat source
      temperature may cause some aircraft gas turbines such as turbofan
      engines to be limited in thermodynamic efficiency to around 37%
      maximum. Terrestrial gas turbines, such as those used to provide
      peak power to electric power grids, may typically reach a
      thermodynamic efficiency of around 60%, but must use a topping
      cycle to remove energy from the combustion gases in stages to
      limit peak temperatures. Topping cycle equipment (which may, for
      example, use non-stoichiometric, staged combustion) is generally
      associated with high capital costs and relatively large size.<br>
      <br>
      Notwithstanding incorrect prior art references to "film-cooling",
      attempts to maintain an actual cooling film adjacent to high
      temperature surfaces has apparently not been tried, because
      cooling flow has been in the form of jets that, as described
      above, actually increase vorticity and heat flow to portions of
      heated surfaces peripheral to cooling holes.<br>
      <br>
      What is needed is technology that allows a gas turbine to operate
      with higher thermodynamic efficiency by reducing dilution and/or
      topping cycles, while protecting high temperature surfaces such as
      turbine blades, combustor walls, turbine inlet guide vanes,
      turbine shaft, turbine stators and/or other heat-exposed parts
      from the increased temperature. What is also needed is a
      technology that may reduce gas turbine capital cost.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      According to an embodiment, a gas turbine may include a combustor
      configured to output a combustion gas stream and a turbine
      including at least one turbine stage configured to receive the
      combustion gas stream. The combustion gas stream may include
      charged particles having a first majority charge sign. One or more
      high temperature surfaces in the combustor and/or the turbine may
      be held or driven to a voltage having a polarity the same as the
      charged particles having the first sign. At least some of the high
      temperature surfaces may be operatively coupled to at least one
      air channel configured to distribute cool air adjacent to the high
      temperature surface. For example, the high temperature surface may
      include a turbine blade, and the at least one air channel may
      include a plurality of holes or slots at or near a leading edge of
      the turbine blade (e.g., near a stagnation point) configured to
      supply the cool air to the surface of the turbine blade. The cool
      air may form a film-cooling layer between the surface of the
      turbine blade and the combustion gas stream. The film-cooling
      layer may be stabilized by Coulombic repulsion forces between the
      voltage of the turbine blade and charged particles in the
      combustion gas stream.<br>
      <br>
      According to another embodiment, a method for operating a gas
      turbine may include outputting a combustion gas stream to a
      turbine, the combustion gas stream including charged particles
      having a first majority charge. A first voltage selected to repel
      the charged particles having the first charge may be applied to
      one or more high temperature surface(s). For example, the high
      temperature surface(s) may include turbine blades of at least one
      stage of the turbine. Cool air may be provided to the surface of
      the high temperature surface(s) through a plurality of holes or
      slots at or near a leading edge of the high temperature
      surfaces(s) (e.g. near a flow stagnation point at the leading edge
      of turbine blades) to form a film-cooling layer between the high
      temperature surface(s) and the combustion gas stream. The
      film-cooling layer may be stabilized by a cascade effect caused by
      the repelling of the charged particles in the combustion gas
      stream by the first voltage.<br>
      <br>
      According to another embodiment, a method for propelling an
      aircraft may include outputting a combustion gas stream to a
      turbine, the combustion gas stream including charged particles
      having a first charge, and applying to turbine blades of at least
      one stage of the turbine a first voltage selected to repel the
      charged particles having the first charge.<br>
      <br>
      According to another embodiment, a method for generating
      electricity may include outputting a combustion gas stream to a
      turbine, the combustion gas stream including charged particles
      having a first charge, and applying to turbine blades of at least
      one stage of the turbine a first voltage selected to repel the
      charged particles having the first charge.<br>
      <br>
      According to another embodiment, an aircraft may include a gas
      turbine. The gas turbine may include a combustor configured to
      output a combustion gas stream and a turbine including at least
      one turbine stage configured to receive the combustion gas stream.
      The combustion gas stream may include charged particles having a
      first sign when received by the at least one turbine stage. The at
      least one turbine stage may include turbine blades held or driven
      to a voltage having a polarity the same as the charged particles
      having the first sign.<br>
      <br>
      According to another embodiment, an electric power generator may
      include a gas turbine. The gas turbine may include a combustor
      configured to output a combustion gas stream and a turbine
      including at least one turbine stage configured to receive the
      combustion gas stream. The combustion gas stream may include
      charged particles having a first sign when received by the at
      least one turbine stage. The at least one turbine stage may
      include turbine blades held or driven to a voltage having a
      polarity the same as the charged particles having the first sign.<br>

      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b>In the following detailed description, reference is made to
      thebaccompanying drawings, which form a part hereof. In the
      drawings, similar symbols typically identify similar components,
      unless context dictates otherwise. The illustrative embodiments
      described in the detailed description, drawings, and claims are
      not meant to be limiting. Other embodiments may be utilized, and
      other changes may be made, without departing from the spirit or
      scope of the subject matter presented here.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 1 is a block diagram of a gas turbine 101 , according to an
      embodiment. The gas turbine 101 includes a compressor 1 12
      configured to compress air, the compressed air then entering a
      combustor 1 14. Fuel is burned in the combustor 1 14 to raise the
      temperature of the air and produce combustion products. The hot
      combustion products exit the combustor 1 14 and travel through a
      turbine 1 16. The turbine 1 16 includes turbine blades attached to
      a shaft 1 18. The combustion gases impinging on the turbine blades
      cause rotation of the shaft 1 18, which provides power to the
      compressor 1 12. The shaft 1 18 may also be coupled to fan blades
      (such as in an aircraft jet engine, not shown) or an electrical
      power generator or alternator (such as in a terrestrial power
      generator or aircraft auxiliary power unit (APU), not shown).<br>
      <br>
      Fuel is introduced to the combustor 1 14 through one or more
      nozzles 120. The combustor 122 includes a wall 122 that must be
      kept cool. Typically, the wall 122 may be cooled by introducing
      cool air through vents (not shown). The combustor wall 122 may
      also be cooled according to methods described herein.<br>
      <br>
      Turbine blade cooling air may be admitted, such as through an air
      passage 124 formed by the shaft 1 18. The turbine blade cooling
      air provides cooling to the shaft 1 18 by forced convection, and
      travels into the turbine blades. Cooling of the turbine blades is
      described in greater detail in conjunction with FIGS. 2 and 3.
      According to an embodiment, one or more electrode(s) 126 may be
      disposed near the fuel nozzle(s) 120. Optionally, the one or more
      electrode(s) 126 may be coextensive with at least a portion of the
      fuel nozzle(s) 120. The electrode(s) 126 may apply a continuous or
      modulated voltage potential near flame(s) anchored by the fuel
      nozzle(s) 120.<br>
      <br>
      During combustion, a flame produces charged intermediate species.<br>
      <br>
      These charged intermediates include free electrons, fuel and fuel
      fragments, oxygen radicals, etc. Conservation of charge dictates
      that positive and negative charges nominally balance such that the
      total charge is approximately neutral. The electrode(s)126 may
      attract charge of opposite sign. For example, the electrode(s) 126
      may be held or modulated to a positive voltage, and may
      responsively attract electrons from the flame. Similarly, the
      electrode(s) 126 may be held or modulated to a negative voltage,
      which responsively removes positively charges species from the
      flame. The electrode(s) 126 may be modulated across a positive and
      negative voltage range, may be modulated in voltage above and
      below a DC bias voltage, and/or may be held at a substantially
      constant DC bias voltage. According to embodiments, the
      electrode(s) 126 may be modulated between relative ground and a
      positive voltage of a few hundred volts at a time-varying
      frequency of a few kilohertz up to a few hundred kilohertz. Higher
      or lower voltages may be used and/or higher or lower frequency may
      be used.<br>
      <br>
      The effect of at least intermittently or periodically removing
      charged particles of one sign or polarity from the flame results
      in a charge imbalance that may be used to apply Coulombic forces
      on the combustion gas. The applied Coulombic forces may directly
      affect the movement of charged particles, and the charged
      particles, in turn, may transfer momentum to uncharged particles.
      As used herein, a "particle" may include an aerosol such as
      unburned fuel, a gas molecule, an ion, and/or an electron, for
      example. As will be described below, the applied Coulombic forces
      may be used to repel hot gas from temperature- sensitive surfaces,
      such as turbine blades, turbine inlet guide vanes, turbine
      stators, the turbine shaft, and/or the combustor wall.<br>
      <br>
      The electrode(s) 126 may be voltage isolated from other portions
      of the gas turbine 101 by suitable clearances (e.g., "air gaps")
      or electrical insulators 128. A voltage source 134 may provide the
      voltage to the electrode(s) 126. The voltage source 134 may also
      apply a voltage to the combustor wall 122 and to the turbine 1 16
      blades and optionally turbine shaft 1 18 via a voltage conduction
      circuit 130. The voltage conduction circuit 130 may include one or
      more electrical insulators 132. Optionally, the voltage source 134
      may provide different voltages to the electrode(s) 126, combustor
      wall 122, and/or turbine 1 16 blades. The voltage source 134 may
      include a DC voltage source and/or a modulated voltage source. It
      is possible that alternative theories could be constructed to
      explain the conversion of Coulonnbic repulsion to electrostatic or
      electrodynannic acceleration g of the bulk region of the fluid.
      FIG. 2 is a diagram 201 illustrating cascaded momentum transfer
      from electrostatically-repelled particles to neutral particles,
      according to an embodiment. Throughout the description herein, it
      may be assumed that voltages are either too low to cause
      dielectric breakdown (arcing) or that passive or active voltage
      control will decrease voltages under conditions where dielectric
      breakdown or incipient dielectric breakdown occurs. While voltages
      and particle charges are shown as positive in FIG. 2, the same
      effect may be seen with negative voltages and negative particle
      charges (or, as will be described more fully below, sign-modulated
      similar charges). Accordingly, the principles illustrated by FIG.
      2 may be applied to a system using one or more constant or
      modulated positive voltages, one or more constant or modulated
      negative voltages, or positive and negative voltages modulated in
      time. In most gas turbine systems, it may be assumed that each
      particle corresponds to a gaseous molecule, atom, or ion.<br>
      <br>
      A body, such as a turbine blade 202, may be driven to or held at a
      voltage, VT, such as a positive voltage. A film-cooling layer 204
      may include substantially only neutral particles 206. Neutral
      particles 206 may be regarded as not interacting with the positive
      voltage VT of the body 202 (ignoring dipole interactions).
      Accordingly, the film-cooling layer 204 may be substantially
      unaffected by Coulombic forces.<br>
      <br>
      A bulk region 207, separated from the body 202 by the film-cooling
      layer 204, may include neutral particles 206 and charged particles
      208. For purposes of description, charged particles 208 may be
      regarded as positively charged. The positively charged particles
      208 may be Coulombically (electrostatically) repelled by the same
      sign voltage VT of the body 202 and may be responsively
      accelerated along a path 209. The path 209 may be visualized as
      the positive particle 206 "falling" through a voltage gradient
      caused by the voltage VT of the body 202. The path 209 (e.g., the
      mean free path 209) typically has a probable distance inversely
      proportional to pressure. The path 209 eventually intersects
      another particle 206, whereupon a collision 210 between the
      charged particle 208 and a second particle 206 causes momentum
      transfer from the charged particle 208 to the second particle 206.
      For an average elastic collision (or a particular elastic
      collision of favorable orientation), momentum of the charged
      particle 208 may be halved, and the momentum of the second
      particle 206 may be increased by the same amount.<br>
      <br>
      For systems where charged particles 208 are present in low
      concentration (which corresponds to most or all embodiments
      described herein), most collisions 210 involving a charged
      particle 208 may be binary interactions between the charged
      particle 208 and a neutral particle 206. After the collision 210,
      momentum transferred to the neutral particle 206 causes it to
      travel a distance near a mean free path until it undergoes a
      collision 212 with another particle after a time approximating a
      mean time between collisions. For systems where charged particles
      208 are present in low concentration, most collisions 212
      involving momentum transfer from a neutral particle 206 may be
      binary interactions between the first neutral particle 206 and a
      second neutral particle 206'. For an average elastic collision,
      half the momentum of the first neutral particle 206 may be
      transferred to the second neutral particle 206'. The first neutral
      particle 206 and the second neutral particle 206' may then travel
      along respective paths until each collides with other respective
      neutral particles in collisions 212 and momentum is again
      transferred. The series of neutral particle collisions 212 thus
      distribute momentum originally received from the charged particle
      208 across a large number of neutral particles 206 according to a
      geometric 2&lt;N&gt; progression in a parallel process.<br>
      <br>
      Meanwhile, the charged particle 208 is again accelerated
      responsive to Coulombic interaction with the voltage VT of the
      body 202, and accelerates along a path to another collision 210,
      whereupon the process is repeated as described above.<br>
      <br>
      According to an illustrative embodiment, charged particles 208 may
      be present in the free stream (also referred to as a combustion
      gas stream) 207 at a concentration on the order of one to
      one-hundred parts per billion (ppb). According to the geometric
      momentum distribution described above, momentum may be transferred
      from one charged particle 208 to a majority of all particles 202,
      208 in the free stream 207 in about 24 to 30 generations of
      collisions 210, 212 (2&lt;30&gt; &gt; 1 X 10&lt;9&gt;, 2&lt;23&gt;
      &gt; 8 X 10&lt;6&gt;). The amount of transferred momentum is a
      function of the voltage VT of the body 202, the magnitude of
      charge carried by the charged particle 208, the pressure of the
      free stream 207 (and hence the mean free path length), and the
      distance from the surface of the body 202 to the charged particle
      208 at the point of each collision 210.<br>
      <br>
      Because Coulombic forces substantially do not act on particles in
      the film- cooling layer 204, the film-cooling layer 204 undergoes
      substantially no repulsion. Moreover, the Coulombic repulsion
      acting on the charge-carrying free stream 207 may be viewed as
      producing a partial vacuum in regions between the surface of the
      charged body 202 and the free stream 207. The film-cooling layer
      204 may thus also be viewed as being held in contact with the
      surface of the body 202 by the partial vacuum produced by
      evacuation of charged particles 208.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 3 is a sectional diagram 301 of a turbine blade 302
      configured for coulombic thermal protection, according to an
      embodiment. A hot combustion gas (a free stream) 304 including
      charged and uncharged species 206, 208 flows over the surface of
      the turbine blade 302. The turbine blade responsively produces a
      lift 306 that causes rotation of a turbine hub (not shown) and a
      turbine shaft (FIG. 1 , 1 18) to which the turbine blade 302 is
      coupled.<br>
      <br>
      The energy delivered by the turbine combustor (FIG. 1 , 1 14) may
      be described as a change in enthalpy corresponding to an increase
      in gas temperature responsive to combustion, according to the
      relationship:<br>
      <br>
      ?? = Cp ??,<br>
      <br>
      where:<br>
      <br>
      ?? is the change in enthalpy,<br>
      <br>
      Cp is the specific heat of the gas at constant pressure, and<br>
      <br>
      ?? is the difference between air inlet temperature and outlet
      temperature. One can then determine that the (undiluted) outlet
      temperature is determined according to the relationship:<br>
      <br>
      TH = Ti + ?? / Cp<br>
      <br>
      where:<br>
      <br>
      TH is the high temperature, and<br>
      <br>
      Ti is the inlet temperature, which may be calculated by
      multiplying the air temperature, T0 by the pressure change
      provided by the compressor (FIG. 1 , 1 12) according to the ideal
      gas law PV=nRT.<br>
      <br>
      The thermodynamic efficiency of the turbine (FIG. 1 , 1 16),
      typically modeled as a Brayton cycle, may be roughly approximated
      as a Carnot cycle, such that efficiency may be approximated as:<br>
      <br>
      &lt;img class="EMIRef" id="150959149-imgf000013_0001" /&gt;<br>
      <br>
      But the maximum temperature TH must be low enough for the first
      stage turbine blade 302 to maintain its structural integrity
      (e.g., not melt). The adiabatic flame temperature of methane
      (natural gas, commonly used for terrestrial gas turbines) is 2200°
      K and that of kerosene (e.g., -JP-4, commonly used for jet
      aircraft engines) is 2366° K. The standard ambient temperature at
      the earth's surface is 20°C (293°K) and the standard temperature
      of the tropopause, where jet aircraft operate is -50.54°C
      (216.5°K). Thus, the maximum Carnot cycle efficiencies that could
      be available for terrestrial and air gas turbines should approach:<br>
      <br>
      Tlmax - 1 - (216.5 / 2366) - 91 % (aircraft)<br>
      <br>
      Tlmax - 1 - (293 / 2200) - 86% (terrestrial)<br>
      <br>
      Unfortunately, achieved efficiencies are nowhere near these
      numbers, in large part because the maximum temperature TH that
      could be produced by the respective fuels is well above the
      melting points of modern turbine blade materials. For this reason
      the outlet temperature of the combustor (FIG. 1 , 1 14) is diluted
      to reduce the temperature of hot combustion gas 304 faced by the
      first stage turbine blade 302. In modern gas turbines used in
      aircraft engines, for example, the combustion gas is diluted with
      ambient air to a temperature of 1370°C (1643°K). At temperatures
      above this, turbine blades have been found to be susceptible to
      plastic creep failure and corrosion failure.<br>
      <br>
      Returning again to FIG. 3, the turbine blade 302 includes a
      cooling air channel 308 configured to deliver cool air to the
      surface of the turbine blade 302 via a plurality of slots or holes
      310 that may be disposed near a leading edge of the turbine blade
      302. Delivery of the cooling air at this location may introduce
      vortices of opposite sign (not shown) in an area of air stagnation
      at the front edge of the turbine blade 302 resulting in minimum
      mixing of the free stream 304 with the cooling air. The cooling
      air may stream over the surface of the turbine blade as a
      film-cooling layer 204. The turbine blade 302, or at least one or
      more portions of the surface of the turbine blade 302, may be
      driven to or maintained at one or more voltages VT. According to
      mechanisms described in conjunction with FIG. 2, the voltage(s) VT
      may repel same-sign charges 208 in the free stream 304, thus
      reducing or substantially eliminating mixing of the hot gas of the
      free stream 304 with the cool film-cooling layer air 204. As
      described above, this may be visualized as the charged particles
      208 "falling" away from the voltage VT along a path 209, and then
      transferring momentum to uncharged particles in the free stream
      304.<br>
      <br>
      At high velocity, the free stream turbulence may form corrugations
      312 in the film-cooling layer. "Troughs" of the corrugations are
      closer to the surface of the turbine blade 302, and therefore also
      at reduced distance from the driving voltage VT. This effect may
      increase acceleration away from the turbine blade 302 applied to
      the fluid in the troughs according to an inverse distance squared
      (1 / h&lt;2&gt;) relationship, for example.<br>
      <br>
      The ability of Coulombic repulsion to maintain a cooling film 204
      against the hot gas of the free stream 304 can be analogized to
      the body force of gravity acting on water at a water-air
      interface. In order to keep the water-air interface relatively
      flat, the potential energy of that body force must be sufficiently
      large compared to the kinetic energy of the free stream
      turbulence. The ratio of these two energies defines a
      dimensionless Richardson number - which is an important parameter
      in stratified flow. In the present system, a Richardson number Ri
      may be defined as:<br>
      <br>
      Ri = (g h) / u&lt;2&gt;,<br>
      <br>
      where:<br>
      <br>
      g is an acceleration of the free stream 304 away from the turbine
      blade<br>
      <br>
      302 due to Coulombic interaction, corresponding to the mechanism
      201 shown in FIG. 2,<br>
      <br>
      h is a representative distance from the surface of the turbine
      blade 302 (e.g., the thickness of the film-cooling layer 204), and<br>
      <br>
      u is a representative velocity of the free stream 304 relative to
      the film- cooling layer 204 velocity.<br>
      <br>
      If the Richardson number is of order one or larger, the potential
      energy of the body force is typically sufficient to stabilize the
      interface in the presence of the free stream 304 turbulence and
      thus preserve the film 204. Embodiments disclosed herein may be
      used for manipulation of the system's Richardson number. Factors
      that influence the Richardson number may include ion 206
      concentration, electric field strength (e.g. by selecting the
      voltage VT), free stream 304 turbulence intensity, and air film
      204 thickness.<br>
      <br>
      Rotation of the turbine blades on the rotor may be expected to
      modify the interface between the free stream 304 and the
      film-cooling layer 204 at locations 312 due to the effective
      density ratio between the free stream 304 and the film- cooling
      layer 204 and due to Ekman layer pumping. A larger Richardson
      number may provide a more robust the interface and resistance to
      rotation effects. Thus, a large Richardson number may permit a
      thinner film-cooling layer 204 and a lower flow rate of cooling
      air. As indicated above, reducing dilution of hot combustion gases
      304 may result in higher thermodynamic efficiency. According to an
      embodiment, an optimal rate of cooling air flow via the slots or
      holes 310 may correspond to a Richardson number of about one,
      wherein the Richardson number is defined to include the kinetic
      energy of the turbulence from both rotation and the free stream
      flow. According to embodiments described herein, the film-cooling
      layer 204 may provide isolation from the hot gas 304 to the
      turbine blade 302. This can reduce or eliminate convective heating
      of the surface of the turbine blade 302, and may leave
      substantially only radiative heat transfer from the free stream
      304 to the turbine blade 302. Because the emissivity of the
      (substantially transparent) free stream 304 may typically be very
      low, radiative heat transfer may be very inefficient, and may
      therefore be neglected.<br>
      <br>
      Use of the Coulombic cooling mechanism illustrated by FIGS. 2 and
      3 may allow higher free stream 304 temperatures, which reduces
      dilution requirements and may result in greater thermodynamic
      efficiency. The approaches described herein may be combined with
      other approaches for increasing allowable turbine blade
      temperatures, including internal cooling air circulation, the use
      of high temperature blade materials, and the use of high
      temperature blade coatings.<br>
      <br>
      The voltage and charge sign applied respectively to the high
      temperature surface and the combustion gas stream may be
      substantially constant during operation, according to an
      embodiment. According to another embodiment, the voltage and/or
      charge signs may be time-varying.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 4 is a timing diagram showing illustrative voltage VE, VT
      waveforms 402, 404 that may be respectively applied to
      electrode(s) 126 of FIG. 1 and turbine blades 302 of FIG. 3,
      according to an embodiment. As described above, the voltage
      delivered to the electrode(s) 126 may be modulated. One advantage
      to voltage modulation may be a decrease in power consumed by the
      voltage source 134. Modulated electrode(s) 126 may be driven from
      a balanced circuit that stores charge in a charge storage
      apparatus such as a capacitor or capacitor array, or other R-C
      circuit, which may result in reduced amplifier power consumption.
      Optionally, such a modulation circuit may be driven in resonance
      to further reduce power consumption. Driving the electrode(s) 126
      in a modulated waveform may also reduce leakage current by
      allowing isolation of the gas turbine 101 to be provided by high
      impedance couplings rather than perfect insulators. One outcome of
      modulating the electrode(s) 126 may be visualized in conjunction
      with FIG. 1. A positive voltage impressed upon the electrode(s)
      126 at a first instance may withdraw electrons from the combustion
      gas, and result in a localized concentration of positively charged
      particles. However, the positively charged particles must travel
      from the combustor 1 14 to the turbine 1 16 over a finite time. A
      subsequent instantaneous neutral or negative voltage impressed
      upon the electrode(s) 126 will similarly result in a localized
      neutrally charged region or a localized concentration of
      negatively charged particles. The time delay caused by travel time
      of the charged regions from the combustor 1 14 to the turbine 1 16
      could have deleterious effects unless the time delay is
      compensated for.<br>
      <br>
      Referring again to FIG. 4, the turbine voltage VT waveform may be
      delayed from the electrode voltage VE waveform by a phase offset
      f, as shown. While the phase offset f is shown as a fraction of a
      period, the phase offset f may alternatively be made to
      accommodate a charged particle travel time of several periods.
      Alternatively, the waveforms VT, VE may substantially not form a
      repeating period, and the offset may be expressed as a time rather
      phase. It will be understood that references to phase are made for
      ease of understanding, and that a time offset may be substituted
      in appropriate expressions. The phase offset f may be provided by
      a delay line from the voltage source (FIG. 1 , 134), or
      alternatively may be produced by a synchronized voltage driver.
      Optionally, the voltage waveforms VE, VT may be driven according
      to a random, pseudo-random, or long bit-length pattern (as shown)
      configured to reduce system resonance.<br>
      <br>
      According to the waveforms VE, VT of FIG. 4, the turbine blade
      voltage VE, VT may be synchronized such that (except for pulse
      edges) VE, VT is substantially always at a voltage having the same
      sign as the passing charged particles, and therefore may
      substantially always repel the free stream 304 according to the
      mechanism described in conjunction with FIGS. 2 and 3.<br>
      <br>
      Alternatively, when the modulated waveform VE, includes a DC bias
      such that all portions of the waveform VE are one sign (polarity),
      the waveform VT may be modulated inversely to (but within the same
      sign as) the waveform VE such that the magnitude of free stream
      repulsion is maintained or varied less (VT being used to
      compensate for a lower concentration of charged particles 208 in
      the free stream).<br>
      <br>
      Optionally, a gas turbine warm-up cycle may be associated with an
      out-of- phase waveform or no voltage waveform(s) to allow the hot
      gas in the free stream 304 to quickly bring the turbine blade 302
      to operating temperature.<br>
      <br>
      Referring to FIG. 1 , an optional counter-ion injection lead 136
      may optionally provide charge of opposite sign to the charge
      imbalance in the gas stream, and thus allow the combustion
      reaction to proceed to completion.<br>
      <br>
      Optionally, the counter-ion injection lead 136 may be configured
      to inject the counter-ions after the first stage turbine blades
      302, between later turbine stages, or at the outlet end of the
      turbine 1 16. The counter-ion injection lead may produce exhaust
      gas that is less reactive than a charged gas stream, thereby
      reducing environmental effects of the system described herein. The
      counter-ion injection lead may further be used to balance charges
      delivered by the voltage source 134, and thereby reduce power
      consumption and/or charge bleed to isolated system components.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 5 is a side sectional diagram of a hot gas flow volume 501
      partially bounded by two juxtaposed high temperature surfaces 502,
      504, according to an embodiment. The hot gas flow volume 501 may
      include a charged volume 506 carrying charged particles 508, and a
      pair of film-cooling layers 510, 512 adjacent to the respective
      high temperature surface 502, 504. The film-cooling layers 510,
      512 may be substantially uncharged and substantially neutral. The
      high temperature surfaces 502, 504 may instantaneously be driven
      to a voltage V&lt;*&gt; having the same polarity as the sign of
      the instant charged particles 508.<br>
      <br>
      One aspect of Coulombic protection includes the provision of an at
      least instantaneous electric field formed from a voltage or charge
      gradient. Charged particles may be driven across the electric
      field. In the example shown in FIG. 5, the voltage gradient may be
      formed between a high voltage V&lt;*&gt; carried by a high
      temperature surface 502 and a somewhat lower voltage-equivalent
      expressed as a charge density in the charged volume 506. The
      voltage gradient may asymptotically approach zero near a center of
      the charged volume 506, which may be visualized as like charged
      particles repelling one another nearly omnidirectionally according
      to proximity between like charges.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 6 is a prophetic diagram 600 showing electric field strength,
      E as a function of distance from a high temperature surface. The
      vertical axis, though not to scale, may be considered to be in
      units of volts per meter or other convenient units. The voltage
      V&lt;*&gt; placed on the high temperature surface 502 may be
      assumed to be below an ionization onset voltage, and hence the
      high temperature surface 502 may avoid becoming a charge source.
      The horizontal axis of FIG. 6 is registered to a corresponding
      axis through FIG. 5. Distance 0 corresponds to the high
      temperature surface. The horizontal axis may be visualized as
      being parallel to a normal to a locally equipotential surface. In
      the case of a simple planar geometry, the horizontal axis may
      extend along a normal to the high temperature surface 502
      proceeding from distance 0 at the high temperature surface to 1 at
      a centerline (C.L.) of the hot gas flow volume 501 (the centerline
      (C.L.) being equally spaced from two equipotential hightemperature
      surfaces 502, 504). As may be seen, the electric field strength E
      may decrease monotonically with dista nce from the high
      temperature surface 502. The greatest slope, and hence the
      greatest electrostatic repulsion between the high temperature
      surface 502 and a same polarity charged particle occurs near the
      high temperature surface 502 in the film-cooling layer 510.
      Diffusion and repulsion forces may cause the edge (illustrated as
      the leftmost dashed line in FIG. 5) between the film-cooling layer
      510 and the charged volume 506 to be indistinct. The
      indistinctness of the interface plus a "shadow" effect of the high
      temperature surface 502 may cause the electric field strength to
      be a continuous function as shown, rather than a discontinuous
      function. In any event, the high slope of the electric field in
      the film-cooling layer 510, and especially nearer the high
      temperature surface 502 bounding the film-cooling layer, causes
      the charged particles to be repelled from the high temperature
      surface 502, thus preserving the film-cooling layer 510 and
      preserving the corresponding thermal isolation between the hot
      gases in the charged volume 506 and the high temperature surface
      502.<br>
