      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0010] In the following detailed description, reference is made to
      the accompanying drawings, which form a part hereof. In the
      drawings, similar symbols typically identify similar components,
      unless context dictates otherwise. The illustrative embodiments
      described in the detailed description, drawings, and claims are
      not meant to be limiting. Other embodiments may be utilized, and
      other changes may be made, without departing from the spirit or
      scope of the subject matter presented here.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] FIG. 1 is a diagram of a burner system 101 including a
      burner 102 configured to support a flame 104, a flame charger 106
      configured to apply a voltage or charge to the flame 104, and an
      inertial electrode launcher 110, according to an embodiment. The
      flame charger 106 may include a depletion electrode configured to
      at least intermittently or periodically attract charged particles
      having a second sign 108b to create at least a portion of the
      flame 104 having a majority of charged particles having a first
      sign 108a. Additionally or alternatively, the flame charger 106
      may be configured to add charged particles having the first sign
      108a. For example, the flame charger may include a corona
      electrode (not shown) configured to eject charged ions 108a toward
      the flame 104. In another example, the flame charger 106 may
      include an ionizer (not shown) configured to add charge to the
      flame 104, to a fuel (not shown) supporting the flame 104, or to
      air or other oxidizer (not shown) that supports the flame 104.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] At least one inertial electrode launcher 110 may be
      configured to launch an inertial electrode 112 in proximity to the
      flame 104. The inertial electrode 112 may include charged
      particles 114 or particles 114 selected to accept a charge.
      Additionally or alternatively, the inertial electrode 112 may
      carry a voltage. The charged particles, charge accepting
      particles, or voltage may be selected to interact with the charged
      particles having the first sign 108a carried by the flame 104 or a
      combustion gas stream 116 produced by the flame 104. The flame
      charger 106 may be integrated with the burner 102, or may be
      separate from the burner 102. The inertial electrode 112 may
      include charged particles 114 that are selected to attract or
      selected to repel the charged particles having the first sign
      108a.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] The inertial electrode launcher 110 may be configured to
      impart momentum onto the inertial electrode 112. According to an
      embodiment, the launched inertial electrode may exhibit fluid
      dynamic properties that are momentum dominated. The charged
      particles having the first sign 108a carried by the flame 104 or
      the combustion gas stream 116 may be selected to respond to the
      momentum carried by the inertial electrode 112. According to an
      embodiment, a region of the flame having fluid dynamic properties
      that are buoyancy dominated may respond to the inertial electrode.<br>
      <br>
      [0014] An electrode driver 118 may be configured to drive, i.e.,
      to control and operate, one or more of the functions or operations
      performed by each of the flame charger 106 and of the inertial
      electrode launcher 110. The electrode driver 118 may be configured
      to periodically or intermittently change the first sign of the
      charged particles 108a carried by the flame 104 or the combustion
      gas stream 116. The electrode driver 118 may also be configured to
      periodically or intermittently change a sign of the charged
      particles 114 carried by the inertial electrode 112. In an
      embodiment using a flame charger 106 that is a depletion
      electrode, the electrode driver may be configured to periodically
      or intermittently change the second sign of charged particles 108b
      attracted by the depletion electrode 106. Changing the sign of the
      particles 108b attracted by the depletion electrode 106 may also
      change the first sign of the charged particles 108a carried by the
      flame 104 or the combustion gas stream 116. The first and second
      signs may be opposite of each other.<br>
      <br>
      [0015] The burner 102 may include a fuel source 120 configured to
      provide fuel for the flame 104. An insulator or gap 122 may be
      configured to isolate the flame charger 106 from ground or another
      voltage. The burner 102 may also include a flame holder 124
      configured to hold the flame.<br>
      <br>
      [0016] Various inertial electrode launchers 110 and inertial
      electrodes 112 are contemplated. According to embodiments, an
      inertial electrode launcher 110 may be configured to launch the
      inertial electrode 112 through an aperture in an insulating
      refractory, such as a furnace, boiler, or burner body (not shown).<br>
      <br>
      [0017] FIG. 2 illustrates an embodiment where the inertial
      electrode launcher 110 includes an inertial electrode burner 202.
      The inertial electrode burner 202 may be configured to at least
      intermittently or periodically support a flame inertial electrode
      112. The inertial electrode launcher 110 may include an inertial
      electrode launcher charger 204, such as a depletion electrode 204
      configured to attract from the flame inertial electrode 112
      charges having a fourth sign 206 to create a majority of charged
      particles having a third sign 114 in the flame inertial electrode
      112. The fourth sign of the charge carried by the charged
      particles 206 attracted from the flame inertial electrode 112 by
      the inertial electrode launcher depletion electrode 204 (to
      produce the majority of charged particles having the third sign
      114 in the flame inertial electrode 112) may be the same as the
      second sign of the charge carried by the charged particles 108b
      attracted from the flame 104 by the depletion electrode 106 (to
      produce the majority of charged particles the first sign 108a in
      the flame 104). Accordingly, the first and third signs of the
      charges carried by the respective majority charged particles 108a,
      114 in the flame 104 and the inertial electrode 112 may be the
      same.<br>
      <br>
      [0018] The fourth sign of the charge carried by the charged
      particles 206 attracted from the flame inertial electrode 112 by
      the inertial electrode launcher depletion electrode 204 (to
      produce the majority of charged particles having the third sign
      114 in the flame inertial electrode 112) may be opposite from the
      second sign of the charge carried by the charged particles 108b
      attracted from the flame 104 by the depletion electrode 106 (to
      produce the majority of charged particles the first sign 108a in
      the flame 104). Accordingly, the first and third signs of the
      charges carried by the respective majority charged particles 108a,
      114 in the flame 104 and the inertial electrode 112 may be
      opposite from one another.<br>
      <br>
      [0019] In alternative embodiments, the electrode launcher charger
      204 may be configured to add charges 114 to the flame virtual
      electrode 112. For example, the electrode launcher charger 204 may
      include a corona electrode (not shown) configured to eject charged
      ions 114 toward the flame virtual electrode 112. In another
      example, the electrode launcher charger 204 may include an ionizer
      (not shown) configured to add charge 114 to the flame virtual
      electrode 112, to fuel (not shown) supporting the flame virtual
      electrode 112, or to air or other oxidizer (not shown) that
      supports the flame virtual electrode 112.<br>
      <br>
      [0020] An electrode driver 118 may be configured to control at
      least one of the sign or concentration of the charged particles
      114 in the flame inertial electrode 112.<br>
      <br>
      [0021] The burner system 101 may include a valve 208 configured to
      control a flow of fuel (not shown) to the flame inertial electrode
      burner 202 and an electrode driver 118 configured to control the
      valve 208 and an igniter or pilot (not shown) configured to ignite
      the flame inertial electrode 112 when the valve 208 is opened. An
      electrical insulator or air gap 210 may be configured to
      electrically isolate the flame inertial electrode 112 from ground
      or another voltage.<br>
      <br>
      [0022] According to the embodiment, the inertial electrode burner
      202 may be arranged to be protected from a fluid flow past the
      burner 102. The arrangement may include positioning the inertial
      electrode burner 202 in the lee of a physical fluid flow barrier
      (not shown).<br>
      <br>
      [0023] According to the embodiment, the flame inertial electrode
      112 may be configured as a flame holder for the flame 104.
      Additionally the flame inertial electrode 112 may be configured to
      affect a shape or location of the flame 104 and may be configured
      to affect a concentration of the charged particles 108a in the
      flame 104.<br>
      <br>
      [0024] FIG. 3 is a diagram showing an inertial electrode launcher
      110 according to another embodiment. The inertial electrode
      launcher 110 may include a body 302 defining a vaporization well
      304 and first and second electrodes 306a, 306b operatively coupled
      to an electrode driver 118. The electrode driver 118 may be
      configured to apply a high voltage to a vaporizing material 308 at
      least temporarily confined by the vaporization well 304. This may
      vaporize the vaporizing material 308 to produce an inertial
      electrode 112 including vapor, aerosol, or vapor and aerosol of
      the vaporizing material 308 carrying charged particles 114.<br>
      <br>
      [0025] The electrode driver 118 may be configured to apply the
      high voltage with a voltage bias having a same sign as a sign of
      charge carried by a majority of the charged particles 114.
      Suddenly applying a voltage through the vaporizing material causes
      a rapid conversion from liquid to vapor, typically without a
      detectable increase in temperature. Vapor launched by the inertial
      electrode may condense to an aerosol during flight.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] The burner system 101 may include a fluid flow passage 310
      configured to admit the vaporizing material 308 to the
      vaporization well 304 and a valve or actuator 312 configured to
      enable a flow of the vaporizing material 308 through the fluid
      flow passage 310 to the vaporization well 304. The valve or
      actuator 312 may be operatively coupled to the electrode driver
      118.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] A nozzle 314 may be configured to determine a direction of
      travel 316 of the vapor, aerosol, or vapor and aerosol of the
      vaporizing material 308 forming the inertial electrode 112. An
      actuator (not shown) operatively coupled to the electrode driver
      118 may be configured to align the nozzle 314 to an intended
      direction of travel 316 of the vapor, aerosol, or vapor and
      aerosol of the liquid 308 forming the inertial electrode 112.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] The voltage bias and the charge sign of the majority
      charged particles 114 carried by the inertial electrode 112 is the
      same as the first sign of the charges carried by the majority
      charged particles 108a in the flame 104. Alternatively, the
      voltage bias and the charge sign of the majority charged particles
      114 carried by the inertial electrode 112 may be the opposite of
      the first sign of the charges carried by the majority charged
      particles 108a in the flame 104.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] The inertial electrode launcher 110 may be arranged to be
      protected from a fluid flow past the burner 102, such as by
      positioning the inertial electrode launcher 110 in the lee of a
      physical fluid flow barrier (not shown).<br>
      <br>
      [0030] The inertial electrode 112 may be configured as a flame
      holder for the flame 104. Additionally or alternatively, the
      inertial electrode 112 may be driven to affect a shape or location
      of the flame 104 and/or may be driven to affect a concentration of
      the charged particles 108a in the flame 104 or the combustion gas
      stream 116.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] The vaporizing material 308 may include a liquid such as
      water. The material 308 may additionally or alternatively include
      a dissolved solute and/or a molten salt. In some embodiments, the
      vaporizing material 308 may include, for example, a gel such as a
      hydrogel, gelatin and/or slurry. The slurry may include a liquid
      and an undissolved phase configured to be carried by the liquid
      when the liquid is vaporized. The undissolved phase may include
      carbon, for example. Additionally, the slurry may include a liquid
      and an undissolved phase selected to be vaporized by the voltage.
      A vaporizing undissolved phase may include a lithium salt, for
      example.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] FIG. 4 illustrates an embodiment where the inertial
      electrode launcher 110 is configured to project an inertial
      electrode including charged solids. The inertial electrode
      launcher 110 may include a body 402 defining an orifice 404 from
      which solid particles 406 are projected to a location proximate
      the flame 104. The projected solid particles 406 may include at
      least one or more charged particles 114. The charged solid
      particles 406 may substantially form the inertial electrode 112.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] The orifice 404 may include a Venturi passage. The solid
      particles 406 may be configured to be projected by an entrainment
      fluid 408 such as air passing through the orifice 404. The solid
      particles 406 may be injected into the passing entrainment fluid
      at the orifice 404 through a particle channel 410. A particle
      valve 412 may be operatively coupled to the electrode driver 118.
      The electrode driver 118 may be configured to control a rate of
      flow of particles through the particle channel 410 and/or a
      periodicity or intermittent timing of particle flow through the
      particle channel 410.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] A corona surface 414 may be configured to be driven to
      sufficient voltage to cause an emission of charges. Some of the
      charges emitted by the corona may be deposited on at least some of
      the solid particles 406. The corona surface 414 may include a
      corona wire (not shown) and may include a corotron or scorotron
      (neither shown). The corona surface 414 may be operatively coupled
      to the electrode driver 118. The electrode driver 118 may be
      configured to control the voltage to which the corona surface 414
      is driven.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] The voltage sign to which the corona surface 414 is driven
      and the charge sign of the majority charged particles 114 carried
      by the inertial electrode 112 may be the same as the first sign of
      the charges carried by the majority charged particles 108a in the
      flame 104 or alternatively may be opposite of the first sign of
      the charges carried by the majority charged particles 108a in the
      flame 104.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] The burner system 101 may further include an actuator (not
      shown) operatively coupled to the electrode driver 118 configured
      to align the orifice 404 to an intended direction of travel 416 of
      the charged solid particles 406 forming the inertial electrode
      112.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] The inertial electrode launcher 110 may be arranged to be
      protected from a fluid flow past the burner 102. This may include
      positioning the inertial electrode launcher 110 in the lee of a
      physical fluid flow barrier (not shown). The inertial electrode
      112 may be configured as a flame holder for the flame 104.
      Additionally or alternatively, the inertial electrode 112 may be
      driven to affect a shape or location of the flame 104 and the
      inertial electrode 112 may be driven to affect a concentration of
      the charged particles 108a in the flame 104.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] The solid particles 406 may include comminuted coal, coke,
      or carbon. The solid particles 406 may be selected to react in the
      flame 104 or the combustion gas stream 116 produced by the flame
      104.<br>

      [0039] FIG. 5 is a diagram showing an inertial electrode launcher
      110 including a nozzle 502 configured to at least intermittently
      or periodically receive a voltage from the electrode driver 118
      and expel a fluid carrying charged particles or a voltage
      corresponding to the voltage received from the electrode driver.
      The nozzle 502 may be configured to expel a fluid 510 carrying
      charged particles 114, wherein the charged particles 114 and fluid
      510 may form the inertial electrode 112. Alternatively or
      additionally, the nozzle 502 may expel a conductive fluid selected
      to carry a voltage corresponding to the voltage placed on the
      nozzle 502. The fluid 510 may include a liquid such as water.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] A valve 504 may be operatively coupled to the electrode
      driver 118 and may be configured to respond to an actuation signal
      from the electrode driver 118 to at least intermittently or
      periodically open flow of the fluid from a fluid supply system 506
      to flow through the nozzle 502. The fluid supply system 506 may be
      configured to supply the fluid 510 to the nozzle 502 and maintain
      electrical isolation between the fluid 510 and a fluid source 516.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] The fluid supply system 506 may further include a tank 508
      to hold the fluid 510, the tank may be made of an electrically
      insulating material or may be supported by electrical insulators
      512 to isolate the fluid 510 from ground or another voltage. An
      antisiphon arrangement 514 may be configured to maintain
      electrical isolation between the fluid 510 and the fluid source
      516.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] The voltage sign to which the nozzle 502 may be driven and
      the charge sign of the fluid charges 114 carried by the inertial
      electrode 112 may be the same as the first sign of the charges
      carried by the majority charged particles 108a in the flame 104 or
      in the combustion gas stream 116. Alternatively, the voltage sign
      to which the nozzle 502 may be driven and the charge sign of the
      fluid charges 114 carried by the inertial electrode 112 may be the
      opposite of the first sign of the charges carried by the majority
      charged particles 108a in the flame 104 or in the combustion gas
      stream 116.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] The burner system 101 may further include an actuator (not
      shown) operatively coupled to the electrode driver 118 that may be
      configured to align the nozzle 502 to an intended direction of
      travel of the inertial electrode 112.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] The nozzle 502 may be arranged to be protected from a fluid
      flow past the burner 102. The protection may include positioning
      the nozzle 502 in the lee of a physical fluid flow barrier (not
      shown). The inertial electrode 112 may be configured as a flame
      holder for the flame 104.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] The inertial electrode 112 may be driven to affect a shape
      or location of the flame 104 or the combustion gas stream 116 and
      the inertial electrode 112 may be driven to affect a concentration
      of the charged particles 108a in the flame 104. Optionally, the
      fluid 510 may be selected to react in the flame 104 or the
      combustion gas stream 116 produced by the flame 104, or may carry
      particles selected to react.<br>
      <br>
      [0046] The burner system 101 may further include an electrode
      driver 118 and a depletion electrode launcher (not shown)
      operatively coupled to the electrode driver 118. The depletion
      electrode 106 may be an inertial electrode 112.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] The burner system 101 may further include a heated
      apparatus (not shown). The heated apparatus may include one or
      more of an electrical power generator, a turbine, a chemical
      process plant, a boiler, a water heater, a furnace, a land
      vehicle, a ship, or an aircraft configured to receive heat from
      the flame 104 or the combustion gas stream 116.<br>
      <br>
      [0048] FIG. 6 is a flow chart illustrating a method 601 for
      operating a burner system including an inertial electrode,
      according to an embodiment. Beginning at step 602, a burner may
      support a flame. Proceeding to step 604, at least a portion of the
      flame or the combustion gas produced by the flame is caused to
      carry a majority charge having a first sign. Causing at least a
      portion of the flame or the combustion gas produced by the flame
      to carry the majority charge with the first sign may include
      attracting a charge opposite to the majority charge with a
      depletion electrode. In another embodiment, causing at least a
      portion of the flame or the combustion gas produced by the flame
      to carry the majority charge may include adding the majority
      charge to the flame or the combustion gas produced by the flame,
      such as with an ion-ejecting electrode or with an ionizer.
      Additionally or alternatively, causing at least a portion of the
      flame or the combustion gas produced by the flame to carry the
      majority charge may be performed by launching a flame charging
      inertial electrode in proximity to the flame or the combustion gas
      produced by the flame. For example, the majority charge carried by
      the flame or the combustion gas produced by the flame may
      correspond to a majority charge carried by the flame charging
      inertial electrode.<br>
      <br>
      [0049] Proceeding to step 606, an inertial electrode is launched
      in proximity to the flame or to the combustion gas produced by the
      flame. Step 606 may include causing the inertial electrode to
      carry majority charges having a second sign. According to an
      embodiment, the sign of the majority charges carried by the
      inertial electrode may be the same as the first sign of the
      majority charges carried by at least a portion of the flame or the
      combustion gas produced by the flame (e.g., to cause the inertial
      electrode to repel the flame). Alternatively, the sign of the
      majority charges carried by the inertial electrode may be opposite
      of the first sign of the majority charges carried by the flame or
      the combustion gas produced by the flame (e.g., to cause the
      inertial electrode to attract the flame).<br>
      <br>
      [0050] Proceeding to step 608, a shape, location, or other
      attribute of the flame may be affected with the inertial
      electrode. For example, the inertial electrode may, in step 608,
      affect a concentration of the charged particles in the flame or
      the combustion gas produced by the flame. Alternatively or
      additionally, at least a portion of the inertial electrode may
      react with the flame or the combustion gas produced by the flame.
      Additionally or alternatively, a flame may be flattened,
      lengthened, caused to flow toward or away from an inertial
      electrode, caused to emit more or less radiation, caused to
      combust to a greater degree of completion, cooled, caused to react
      more rapidly, or otherwise modified by the inertial electrode.<br>
      <br>
      [0051] According to an embodiment, the method 601 may include
      protecting an inertial electrode launcher from exposure to a fluid
      flow past the flame (not shown). For example, protecting the
      inertial electrode launcher from exposure to the fluid flow past
      the flame may include positioning the inertial flame holder and/or
      at least a portion of the inertial electrode in the lee of a
      physical fluid flow barrier (not shown). In such a case, step 608
      may include providing flame holding with the inertial electrode<br>
      <br>
      [0052] Proceeding to step 610, heat from the flame or the
      combustion gas produced by the flame may be supplied to an
      apparatus, system, or process. For example, step 610 may include
      supplying heat from the flame or the combustion gas produced by
      the flame to an electrical power generator, a turbine, a chemical
      process plant, a boiler, a water heater, a furnace, a land
      vehicle, a ship, or an aircraft.<br>
      <br>
      [0053] Referring again to step 606, various forms of inertial
      electrodes are contemplated. Some embodiments are described above
      in conjunction with FIGS. 1-5. For example, step 606 may include
      launching a second flame comprising the inertial electrode. The
      second flame may be caused to carry an inertial electrode majority
      charge.<br>
      <br>
      [0054] Alternatively, launching the inertial electrode in step 606
      may include vaporizing a liquid carrying an inertial electrode
      majority charge and projecting the vaporized liquid or an aerosol
      of the liquid in proximity to the flame or the combustion gas
      produced by the flame. Vaporizing the liquid carrying the inertial
      electrode majority charge may include applying a biased voltage
      through the liquid between electrodes.<br>
      <br>
      [0055] According to another embodiment, launching the inertial
      electrode in step 606 may include propelling solid particles
      carrying an inertial electrode majority charge. For example,
      propelling solid particles carrying an inertial electrode majority
      charge may include entraining the solid particles in a fluid
      stream and depositing the inertial electrode majority charge on
      the entrained solid particles. The solid particles may include at
      least one of comminuted coal, coke, or carbon.<br>
      <br>
      [0056] According to another embodiment, launching the inertial
      electrode in step 606 may include energizing a nozzle with an
      inertial electrode voltage and projecting a liquid from the
      nozzle. For example, the liquid may include water.<br>
      <br>
      [0057] Optionally, the method 601 may include actuating a
      direction of launch of the inertial electrode (not shown).
      Optionally, the method 601 may include actuating a timing, volume,
      or charge concentration of the inertial electrode (not shown).<br>
