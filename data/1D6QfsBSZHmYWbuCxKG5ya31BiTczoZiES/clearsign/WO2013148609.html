          <b>BACKGROUND</b><br>
          <br>
          Combustion reactions may produce a variety of combustion
          products, including particulate products. Government
          regulations impose limits on the amount of particulate
          pollution that can be released into the atmosphere. It may
          therefore necessary to control the amount of particulates
          produced in a combustion reaction and/or to remove some
          portion of the particulates from a combustion exhaust stream
          before it is released.<br>
          <br>
          <b>SUMMARY</b><br>
          <b> </b><br>
          In an embodiment, a system is configured to apply electrical
          energy to a combustion reaction to produce agglomerated
          combustion particulates. The system includes at least one
          electrode, and can include a plurality of electrodes. The
          electrode is configured to apply electrical energy to a
          combustion reaction. The system includes a combustion zone.
          The combustion zone is configured to support the combustion
          reaction of a fuel at or near a fuel source. The combustion
          reaction produces a distribution of combustion particulates.
          The distribution of combustion particulates can be
          characterized by an average particulate diameter or an average
          particulate mass. The system also includes an electrical power
          source. The electrical power source is operatively coupled to
          the electrode. The electrical power source is configured to
          apply electrical energy, via the electrode, to the combustion
          reaction. The electrical energy applied via the electrode to
          the combustion reaction is controlled to be sufficient to
          cause an increase in the average particulate diameter or in
          the average particulate mass of the combustion particulates.
          The increase in average particulate diameter or average
          particulate mass of the combustion particulates produces a
          modified distribution of agglomerated combustion particulates.<br>
          <br>
          According to an embodiment, the system includes first and
          second electrodes, and is configured to form an electrical
          circuit through the combustion reaction.<br>
          <br>
          According to an embodiment, a method of agglomerating
          particulates in a combustion reaction is provided. The method
          includes contacting a fuel and an oxidant in a combustion zone
          to support a combustion reaction, which produces a
          distribution of combustion particulates. The method also
          includes applying electrical energy to the combustion reaction
          sufficient to cause agglomeration of the combustion
          particulates.<br>

          <b> </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</b><br>
          <b> </b><br>
          <b> </b>In the following detailed description, reference is
          made to the accompanying drawings, which form a part hereof.
          In the drawings, similar symbols typically identify similar
          components, unless context dictates otherwise. Other
          embodiments may be used and/or other changes may be made
          without departing from the spirit or scope of the disclosure.<br>
          <br>
          The inventor has recognized that removing particulates from a
          combustion exhaust stream can be difficult. Many are of such
          small size that collecting the particles by filtering or other
          particulate collection methods is undesirably difficult,
          expensive, inefficient, etc. According to various embodiments,
          systems and methods are provided in which the combustion
          particulates produced in combustion reactions are made to
          agglomerate into larger clusters, i.e., agglomerated
          particulates. According to some embodiments, the larger
          agglomerated particulates can be removed from an exhaust
          stream more easily and with less expense than typical
          combustion particulates. According to other embodiments, the
          agglomerated particulates can be removed from an exhaust
          stream with lower pressure drop (e.g., expressed as reduced
          back pressure), with higher removal efficiency, and/or with
          reduced loss of thermodynamic efficiency. Furthermore, because
          they are larger and more massive, agglomerated particulates
          that may remain in the exhaust stream fall out of the
          atmosphere more quickly, and thus have a lower impact on air
          quality.<br>
          <br>
          In tests, it was found that combustion particles can be made
          to agglomerate when the combustion reaction is energized by an
          electrical source. In particular, the inventor found that a
          number of different types of signals can be applied to promote
          agglomeration. With regard to DC-type signals, a positive-
          polarity signal applied to the combustion reaction can be more
          effective than a negative polarity signal. Regarding periodic
          signals, a signal that that alternates polarity can be used,
          as can a signal that does not change polarity, i.e., a signal
          with a DC offset. In general, frequencies of between about 50
          Hz and 1000 Hz are effective, with the strongest agglomeration
          being achieved at frequencies between about 200 Hz and 300 Hz.
          Results are also stronger at higher signal voltage levels. On
          the other hand, current levels, and thus power consumption,
          are very low. Typically, the signal voltage should be above
          1000 V, and can exceed 40,000 V.<br>
          <br>
          These values can vary according to various of factors, such
          as, for example, the type, size, and temperature of the
          combustion reaction, the configuration of the space in which
          the combustion occurs, the formulations of the fuel and
          oxidizer, the ambient temperature, humidity, etc.<br>
          <br>
          It is theorized that the agglomeration is caused by an
          increase in effective particle diameter responsive to the
          acceleration of charged particles in the electric field.
          Collisions between charged and uncharged particles can
          accelerate the uncharged particles. The increase in effective
          diameter increases the likelihood that it will come into
          contact with other such particulates. As particulates of
          appropriate types contact each other, they tend to adhere,
          forming agglomerated particles.<br>
          <br>
          FIG. 1 is a block diagram of a system 101 configured to apply
          electrical energy to a combustion reaction 104 to produce
          agglomerated combustion particulates, according to an
          embodiment. The system 101 includes one or more electrodes
          102. The one or more electrodes 102 are configured to apply
          electrical energy to a combustion reaction 104. The system 101
          also includes a combustion zone 106. The combustion zone 106
          is configured to support the combustion reaction 104 of a fuel
          108 supplied by a fuel source 1 10. The combustion reaction
          104 is capable of producing a distribution 1 12 of combustion
          particulates 1 14. The distribution 1 12 of the combustion
          particulates 1 14 can be characterized by at least one of an
          average particulate diameter 202 (see FIG. 2) or an average
          particulate mass. The system 101 also includes an electrical
          power source 1 16. The electrical power source 1 16 is
          operatively coupled to the one or more electrodes 102. The
          electrical power source 1 16 is configured to apply electrical
          energy via the one or more electrodes 102 to the combustion
          reaction 104. The electrical energy applied via the one or
          more electrodes 102 to the combustion reaction 104 is
          sufficient to cause an increase in at least one of the average
          particulate diameter 202 or the average particulate mass of
          the distribution 1 12 of the combustion particulates 1 14. The
          increase in at least one of the average particulate diameter
          202 or the average particulate mass of the distribution 1 12
          of the combustion particulates 1 14 produces a modified
          distribution 212 of agglomerated combustion particulates 214
          (see FIG. 2).<br>
          <br>
          FIG. 2 is a conceptual scheme 201 illustrating the
          distribution 1 12 of the combustion particulates 1 14 and the
          average particulate diameter 202. FIG. 2 also illustrates the
          modified distribution 212 of the agglomerated combustion
          particulates 214 and the modified average particulate diameter
          204.<br>
          <br>
          Referring again to FIG. 1 , in an embodiment, the system 101
          also includes the fuel source 1 10. The fuel source 1 10 is
          configured to deliver the fuel 108 in the form of one or more
          of a gas, a liquid, a solid, or a powdered solid. Additionally
          or alternatively, the combustion reaction 104 can include a
          flame. Additionally or alternatively, the combustion reaction
          108 can at least<br>
          <br>
          intermittently produce the distribution 1 12 of the combustion
          particulates 1 14. Additionally or alternatively, the
          distribution 1 12 of the combustion particulates 1 14 can be
          visible or invisible to the human eye.<br>
          <br>
          In an embodiment, the electrical power source 1 16 is
          configured to apply the electrical energy via the one or more
          electrodes 102 to the combustion reaction 104 sufficient to
          cause an increase of at least about 50% in the average
          particulate diameter 202 of the distribution 1 12 of the
          combustion particulates 1 14. The increase of at least about
          50% in the average particulate diameter 202 of the
          distribution 1 12 of the combustion particulates 1 14 produces
          the modified average particulate diameter 204 of the modified
          distribution 212 of the agglomerated combustion particulates
          214. Additionally or alternatively, the average particulate
          diameter 202 of the distribution 1 12 of the combustion
          particulates 1 14 can also be increased such that the modified
          average particulate diameter 204 is in a range between about 1
          micrometer and about 1 millimeter.<br>
          <br>
          In an embodiment, the electrical power source 1 16 is
          configured to apply the electrical energy via the one or more
          electrodes 102 to the combustion reaction 104 sufficient to
          cause an increase of at least about 50% in the average
          particulate mass of the distribution 1 12 of the combustion
          particulates 1 14. The increase of at least about 50% in the
          average particulate mass of the distribution 1 12 of the
          combustion particulates 1 14 produces the modified average
          particulate mass of the modified distribution 212 of the
          agglomerated combustion particulates 214. Additionally or
          alternatively, the average particulate mass of the
          distribution 1 12 of the combustion particulates 1 14 can be
          increased such that the modified average particulate mass is
          in a range between about 0.1 microgram and about 1 milligram.<br>
          <br>
          In an embodiment, the system 101 includes a controller 1 18.
          The controller 1 18 is operatively coupled to the electrical
          power source 1 16. The controller 1 18 is configured via
          machine executable instructions. The machine executable
          instructions can cause the controller 1 18 to automatically
          control the electrical power source 1 16. The electrical power
          source 1 16 is automatically controlled to apply the
          electrical energy via the one or more electrodes 102 to the
          combustion reaction 104. The electrical energy is sufficient
          to cause the increase in at least one of the average
          particulate diameter 202 or the average particulate mass of
          the distribution 1 12 of the combustion particulates 1 14 to
          produce the modified distribution 212 of the agglomerated
          combustion particulates 214.<br>
          <br>
          In an embodiment, the system 101 may include at least one
          sensor 120. The at least one sensor is operatively coupled to
          the controller 1 18. The controller 1 18 is configured to
          detect a sensor value from the at least one sensor 120, for
          example, configured at least in part according to the machine
          executable instructions. Additionally or alternatively, the
          controller 1 18 can automatically control the electrical power
          source 1 16 to apply the electrical energy via the one or more
          electrodes 102 to the combustion reaction 104 at least in part
          responsive to the sensor value from the at least one sensor
          120.<br>
          <br>
          In various embodiments, the controller 1 18 and the at least
          one sensor 120 are configured to detect the sensor value
          corresponding to one or more of the following values. The
          sensor value may correspond to a fuel flow rate. The sensor
          value may correspond to a temperature. The sensor value may
          correspond to an oxygen level. The sensor value may correspond
          to a voltage. The sensor value may correspond to a charge. The
          sensor value may<br>
          <br>
          correspond to a capacitance. The sensor value may correspond
          to a current. The sensor value may correspond to a
          time-varying electrical signal. The sensor value may
          correspond to a frequency of a periodic electrical signal. The
          sensor value may correspond to an observed value that
          correlates to the average particulate diameter. The sensor
          value may correspond to an observed value that correlates to
          the average particulate mass. The sensor value may<br>
          <br>
          correspond to an observed value that correlates to a density
          of the distribution of particulates. The sensor value may
          correspond to an electromagnetic scattering value, for
          example, a scattering of infrared, visible, or ultraviolet
          light. The sensor value may correspond to an electromagnetic
          absorption value, for example, an absorption of infrared,
          visible, or ultraviolet light. The sensor value may correspond
          to an electromagnetic emission value, for example, an emission
          of infrared, visible, or ultraviolet light.<br>
          <br>
          In an embodiment, the electrical power source 1 16 is
          configured to apply the electrical energy to the combustion
          reaction 104 by delivering a charge, a voltage, or an electric
          field through the one or more electrodes 102. For example, the
          electrical power source 1 16 is configured to apply the
          electrical energy to the combustion reaction 104 as a static
          electrical signal through the one or more electrodes 102. The
          electrical power source 1 16 is configured to apply the
          electrical energy to the one or more electrodes 102 in a
          voltage range between about +50,000 kilovolts and about
          -50,000 kilovolts. Additionally or alternatively, the
          electrical power source 1 16 is configured to apply the
          electrical energy to the combustion reaction 104 as a
          time-varying electrical signal through the one or more
          electrodes 102. The time-varying electrical signal may include
          a periodic component. For example, the time-varying electrical
          signal may include a periodic component characterized by one
          or more frequencies in a range between about 1 Hertz and about
          10,000 Hertz. Additionally or alternatively, the time-varying
          electrical signal can include an alternating current.<br>
          <br>
          In an embodiment, the system 101 includes a plurality of
          electrodes 102 operatively coupled to the electrical power
          source 1 16. The electrical power source 1 16 is configured to
          drive the plurality of electrodes 102 in a manner similar to
          that described above with reference to FIG. 1. Another example
          of a system that employs a plurality of electrodes is
          described in more detail below, with reference to FIG. 4.<br>
          <br>
          FIG. 3 is a conceptual schematic of a circuit 301 . In an
          embodiment, the circuit 301 is configured from, for example,
          the first electrode 102A, the second electrode 102B, the
          electrical power supply 1 16, and the combustion reaction 104.
          The electrical power source 1 16 is configured to electrically
          drive the circuit 301 . The combustion reaction 104 functions
          in the circuit 301 at least<br>
          <br>
          intermittently as one or more of a resistor, a capacitor, or
          an inductor. FIG. 4 is a block diagram of a system 401 . In an
          embodiment, the system 401 is configured to apply electrical
          energy to the combustion reaction 104 to produce the
          agglomerated combustion particulates.<br>
          <br>
          The system 401 includes a first electrode 102A and a second
          electrode 102B. The electrical power source 1 16 is configured
          to drive the first electrode 102A and the second electrode
          102B. In the example shown, the electrical power source 1 16
          is configured to drive the first and second electrodes 102A
          and 102B, with a time-varying electrical signal in a range
          between about 1 Hertz and about 1200 Hertz. The electrical
          power source 1 16 is configured to drive the first and second
          electrodes 102A and 102B, with the voltage in a range between
          about +15,000 volts and about -15,000 volts.<br>
          <br>
          The system 401 is configured to form a closed electrical
          circuit. During operation, the electrical power source 1 16
          drives the circuit, producing an electrical current that
          passes through the first electrode 102A, the combustion
          reaction 104, and the second electrode 102B. In some
          embodiments, the circuit may be intermittent, as action of a
          flame, for example, opens and closes the circuit.<br>
          <br>
          The electrical power source 1 16 and controller 1 18 can be
          configured to automatically control parameters of the energy
          applied to the combustion process to obtain a desired result.
          For example, where agglomeration of the combustion
          particulates 214 to produce a smaller number of relatively
          large particulates is desired, the electrical power source 1
          16 and controller 1 18 can be configured to control signal
          frequency and voltage to cause agglomeration of the
          particulates 214, using feedback from the sensor 120 to
          determine the optimum values.<br>
          <br>
          The system 401 may include a particulate separation device
          402. The particulate separation device 402 is configured to
          collect a portion of the modified distribution 212 of the
          agglomerated combustion particulates 214. Additionally or
          alternatively, the particulate separation device 402 is
          configured to collect a portion of the distribution 1 12 of
          the combustion particulates 1 14. Additionally or
          alternatively, the particulate separation device 402 is
          configured to collect the modified distribution 212 of the
          agglomerated combustion particulates 214 preferentially or
          selectively compared to the distribution 1 12 of the
          combustion particulates 1 14. For example, the portion of the
          modified distribution 212 of the agglomerated combustion
          particulates 214 is collected by the particulate separation
          device 402 according to the increase in the average
          particulate diameter 202 or the average particulate mass of
          the distribution 1 12 of the combustion particulates 1 14. The
          portion of the modified distribution 212 of the agglomerated
          combustion particulates 214 is collected by the particulate
          separation device 402 according to the modified average
          particulate diameter 204 or the modified average particulate
          mass of the modified distribution 212 of the agglomerated
          combustion particulates 214. The particulate separation device
          402 includes one or more of: a filter, a baghouse, a cyclone
          separator, a baffle separator, a wet scrubber, or an
          electrostatic precipitator.<br>
          <br>
          FIG. 5 is a flow diagram of a method 501 of agglomerating
          particulates in a combustion reaction. In an embodiment, the
          method 501 includes an operation 502 of contacting a fuel and
          an oxidant in a combustion zone to support a combustion
          reaction. The method 501 also includes an operation 504 of
          reacting the fuel and the oxidant in the combustion reaction
          to at least intermittently produce a distribution of
          combustion particulates. The distribution of combustion
          particulates is characterized by at least one of an average
          particulate diameter or an average particulate mass. The
          method 501 also includes an operation 506 of applying
          electrical energy to the combustion reaction sufficient to
          cause an increase in at least one of the average particulate
          diameter or the average particulate mass of the distribution
          of the combustion particulates to produce a modified
          distribution of agglomerated combustion particulates. The
          operation 506 of applying the electrical energy is conducted
          by an electrical power supply. The electrical power supply is
          configured to apply the electrical energy via one or more
          electrodes. The one or more electrodes are configured to apply
          the electrical energy from the electrical power supply to the
          combustion reaction.<br>
          <br>
          In an embodiment, the method 501 includes providing the fuel
          in the form of one or more of a gas, a liquid, a solid, or a
          powdered solid. Additionally or alternatively, the method 501
          includes contacting the fuel and the oxidant in the combustion
          zone to support a flame. Additionally or alternatively, in the
          method 501 , the distribution of the combustion particulates
          is visible or invisible to the human eye.<br>
          <br>
          In an embodiment, the method 501 includes applying the
          electrical energy to the combustion reaction sufficient to
          cause an increase of at least about 50% in the average
          particulate diameter of the distribution of the combustion
          particulates. The increase of at least about 50% in the
          average particulate diameter produces a modified average
          particulate diameter of the modified distribution of the
          agglomerated combustion particulates. The method 501 also
          includes increasing the average particulate diameter of the
          distribution of the combustion particulates such that the
          modified average particulate diameter is in a range between
          about 1 micrometer and about 1 millimeter.<br>
          <br>
          In an embodiment, the method 501 includes applying the
          electrical energy to the combustion reaction sufficient to
          cause an increase of at least about 50% in the average
          particulate mass of the distribution of the combustion
          particulates. The increase of at least about 50% in the
          average particulate mass produces a modified average
          particulate mass of the modified distribution of the<br>
          <br>
          agglomerated combustion particulates. The method 501 also
          includes increasing the average particulate mass of the
          distribution of the combustion particulates such that the
          modified average particulate mass is in a range between about
          0.1 microgram and about 1 milligram.<br>
          <br>
          In an embodiment, the method 501 includes automatically
          applying the electrical energy to the combustion reaction
          sufficient to cause the increase in at least one of the
          average particulate diameter or the average particulate mass
          of the distribution of the combustion particulates to produce
          the modified distribution of the agglomerated combustion
          particulates. Automatically applying the energy is
          accomplished by an automated controller configured by one or
          more machine executable instructions. The machine executable
          instructions are typically carried by a non-transitory
          computer-readable medium. The controller can control the
          electrical power supply to apply the electrical energy
          according to the machine executable instructions. The machine
          executable instructions are configured to carry out one or
          more operations, actions, or steps described herein.<br>
          <br>
          In an embodiment, the method 501 includes detecting a sensor
          value associated with the combustion reaction. Additionally or
          alternatively, the method 501 also includes automatically
          applying the electrical energy to the combustion reaction at
          least in part responsive to the sensor value. The machine
          executable instructions are configured for operating the
          controller to<br>
          <br>
          automatically detect the sensor value associated with the
          combustion reaction.<br>
          <br>
          In various embodiments, the sensor value corresponds to one or
          more of the following values. The sensor value may correspond
          to a fuel flow rate. The sensor value may correspond to a
          temperature. The sensor value may correspond to an oxygen
          level. The sensor value may correspond to a voltage. The
          sensor value may correspond to a charge. The sensor value may<br>
          <br>
          correspond to a capacitance. The sensor value may correspond
          to a current. The sensor value may correspond to a
          time-varying electrical signal. The sensor value may
          correspond to a frequency of a periodic electrical signal. The
          sensor value may correspond to an observed value that
          correlates to the average particulate diameter. The sensor
          value may correspond to an observed value that correlates to
          the average particulate mass. The sensor value may<br>
          <br>
          correspond to an observed value that correlates to a density
          of the distribution of particulates. The sensor value may
          correspond to an electromagnetic scattering value, for
          example, a scattering of infrared, visible, or ultraviolet
          light. The sensor value may correspond to an electromagnetic
          absorption value, for example, an absorption of infrared,
          visible, or ultraviolet light. The sensor value may correspond
          to an electromagnetic emission value, for example, an emission
          of infrared, visible, or ultraviolet light.<br>
          <br>
          In an embodiment, the method 501 includes applying the
          electrical energy by delivering a charge, a voltage, or an
          electric field to the combustion reaction. The method 501
          includes applying the electrical energy to the combustion
          reaction as a static electrical signal. For example, the
          method 501 may include applying the electrical energy to the
          combustion reaction in a voltage range between about +50,000
          kilovolts and about -50,000 kilovolts. The method 501 may
          include applying the electrical energy to the combustion
          reaction in a voltage range between about +15,000 kilovolts
          and about -15,000 kilovolts. In an embodiment, the method 501
          includes applying the electrical energy to the combustion
          reaction as a time-varying electrical signal. The time-varying
          electrical signal may include, for example, an alternating
          current. The time varying electrical signal may include a
          periodic component. For example, the time-varying electrical
          signal may include a periodic component characterized by one
          or more frequencies in a range between about 1 Hertz and about
          10,000 Hertz. In some embodiments, the time-varying electrical
          signal includes a periodic component characterized by one or
          more frequencies in a range between about 1 Hertz and about
          1200 Hertz.<br>
          <br>
          In an embodiment, the method 501 includes applying the
          electrical energy to form a circuit with the combustion
          reaction. The electrical energy is applied to electrically
          drive the circuit. The electrical energy may electrically
          drive the circuit such that the combustion reaction functions
          in the circuit at least intermittently as one or more of a
          resistor, a capacitor, or an inductor. The circuit may further
          include, for example, the one or more electrodes, e.g., a
          first electrode and a second electrode; and the electrical
          power supply, operatively coupled to the one or more
          electrodes; all configured together with the combustion
          reaction to at least intermittently form the circuit.<br>
          <br>
          In an embodiment, the method 501 includes an operation 508 of
          collecting a portion of the modified distribution of the
          agglomerated combustion<br>
          <br>
          particulates, for example, by particulate separation. The
          operation of collecting the portion of the modified
          distribution of the agglomerated combustion<br>
          <br>
          particulates can proceed according at least in part to the
          increase in the average particulate diameter or the average
          particulate mass. Additionally or<br>
          <br>
          alternatively, the method 501 includes collecting a portion of
          the distribution of the combustion particulates. Additionally
          or alternatively, the operation 508 of collecting the portion
          of the modified distribution of the agglomerated combustion
          particulates can proceed preferentially or selectively
          compared to collecting the portion of the distribution of the
          combustion particulates. For example, the portion of the
          modified distribution of the agglomerated combustion
          particulates is collected by particulate separation according
          to the increase in the average particulate diameter or the
          average particulate mass of the distribution of the combustion
          particulates. Additionally or alternatively, collecting the
          portion of the modified distribution of the agglomerated
          combustion particulates is collected by particulate separation
          according to the modified average particulate diameter or the
          modified average particulate mass of the modified distribution
          of the agglomerated combustion particulates. In an embodiment,
          the method 501 includes collecting the portion of the modified
          distribution of the agglomerated combustion particulates by
          one or more of: filtering, baghouse collecting, cyclonic
          separating, baffle inertial separating, wet scrubbing, or
          electrostatic precipitating.<br>
          <br>
          FIG. 6 is a block diagram of a system 601 . The system 601
          includes a cylindrical housing 602 that defines lateral
          dimensions of a combustion zone, within which the combustion
          reaction occurs. According to an embodiment, at least a
          portion of the housing 602 is conductive, and functions as a
          first electrode. A second electrode 604 is positioned inside
          the housing 602, and is electrically isolated from the
          housing. The electrical power source 1 16 is coupled to the
          housing 602 and second electrode 604, and is configured to
          apply electrical energy to the combustion reaction 104
          substantially as described above, in particular, with
          reference to the embodiment of FIG. 4.<br>
