      An apparatus for enhancing flame radiation includes a flame
      charging system and an electrically isolated electrode. A
      time-varying voltage is applied to the flame charging system and
      the flame charging system imparts a corresponding time-varying
      charge or time-varying voltage onto the flame. The flame responds
      to the time-varying charge or voltage by increasing its
      luminosity.<br>
      <b><br>
      </b><b>CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</b><br>
      <br>
      [0001] The present application claims priority benefit from U.S.
      Provisional Patent Application No. 61/582,239, entitled “METHOD
      AND APPARATUS FOR ENHANCING FLAME RADIATION”, filed Dec. 30, 2011;
      which, to the extent not inconsistent with the disclosure herein,
      is incorporated by reference.<br>
      <b><br>
      </b><b>BACKGROUND</b><br>
      <br>
      [0002] In some boiler and burner designs, it may be desirable to
      transfer at least a portion of combustion energy as radiated
      energy. However, some types of flames are poorly radiating. In
      some cases, heat is radiated by flame impinging on a
      higher-emissivity refractory surface. However, this is not
      possible in all furnaces. Even when refractory walls can be used,
      hard refractory walls add weight and cost to furnace
      installations.<br>
      <br>
      [0003] Fuels with a relatively high C/H atomic ratio, e.g., heavy
      fuel oils and coal, may be used to produce relatively high
      emissivity flames. However, these fuels are also prone to higher
      particulate and carbon monoxide (CO) emissions.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] Cleaner burning fuels such as natural gas exhibit
      relatively poor heat transfer via thermal radiation owing to low
      emissivity of their flames.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] What is needed is a technology that can transform a poorly
      radiating flame into a highly radiating flame. Better radiant heat
      transfer can reduce the size of a furnace. Furnace size is a
      significant component of overall reactor or heater cost. Such a
      technology could reduce the overall size, weight, and cost of new
      furnaces and increase the throughput of existing furnaces and
      processes driven by furnaces. Additionally, such a technology
      would desirably be switchable to allow for rapid heating and
      cooling cycles not possible with designs having high thermal mass.
      Moreover, such a technology would desirably offer directed
      radiation difficult or impossible to achieve with high thermal
      mass, intermediate radiator approaches.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0006] It was found in laboratory testing that the application of
      alternating electrical energy a low emissivity flame greatly
      increases flame emissivity.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] According to an embodiment, a system for radiating energy
      from a flame, such as a hydrocarbon flame, may include a flame
      charging system configured to receive a time-varying voltage and
      impart a corresponding time-varying charge or voltage onto the
      flame. The flame charging system may have at least intermittent
      contact with the flame, and may be embodied as a portion of a fuel
      nozzle, flame holder, or discrete electrode past which the flame
      is directed, may include an ion-ejecting electrode, or may include
      an ionizer. An electrically isolated conductor may be located
      proximate the flame. The electrically isolated conductor may be
      arranged to be in electromagnetic communication with the
      time-varying charge imparted onto the flame, and may be configured
      to interact with the time-varying charge of the flame to increase
      radiated thermal energy.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] According to another embodiment, a method for radiating
      energy from a hydrocarbon flame may include providing a
      hydrocarbon fuel, igniting the hydrocarbon fuel to produce a
      flame, energizing the flame with a time-varying voltage or charge,
      and supporting an isolated electrical conductor adjacent to the
      flame to cause the flame to emit enhanced visible or infrared
      light energy. The electrically isolated conductor may be arranged
      to be in electromagnetic communication with the time-varying
      voltage or charge imparted onto the flame to cause the increased
      radiated thermal energy.<br>

      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b>[0013] In the following detailed description, reference is
      made to the accompanying drawings, which form a part hereof. In
      the drawings, similar symbols typically identify similar
      components, unless context dictates otherwise. The illustrative
      embodiments described in the detailed description, drawings, and
      claims are not meant to be limiting. Other embodiments may be
      utilized, and other changes may be made, without departing from
      the spirit or scope of the subject matter presented here.<br>
      <br>
      [0014] FIG. 1 is a diagram illustrating a system 101 for radiating
      energy from a flame 102, according to an embodiment. In the system
      101, a flame charging system 104 may be configured to receive a
      time-varying voltage and impart a corresponding time-varying
      charge or voltage onto a hydrocarbon flame 102. An electrically
      isolated conductor 106 proximate the flame 102 was found to
      interact with the time-varying charge of the flame 102 to cause
      the flame 102 to change in appearance from being substantially
      transparent to being bright yellow. It was concluded that the
      electrically isolated conductor 106 may be arranged to be in
      electrical communication with the time-varying charge imparted
      onto the hydrocarbon flame 102. The change in flame appearance was
      believed to correspond to an increase in emissivity of heated
      species within the flame.<br>
      <br>
      [0015] The flame charging system 104 may include a flame
      energization electrode having at least intermittent contact with
      the flame 102. The flame charging system 104 may be configured to
      receive a time-varying voltage selected to cause the flame
      energization electrode to impart the corresponding time-varying
      electrical charge or voltage onto the flame. An energization
      electrode may operate by conduction of voltage from the
      energization electrode to the flame.<br>
      <br>
      [0016] Additionally or alternatively, the flame charging system
      may include a charge-ejecting electrode disposed proximate to the
      flame. The charge-ejecting electrode may be configured to receive
      a time-varying voltage and to eject a corresponding time-varying
      electrical charge toward the flame. The charge-ejecting electrode
      may be referred to as a corona electrode. The charge-ejecting
      electrode may include a sharp electrode.<br>
      <br>
      [0017] Additionally or alternatively, the flame charging system
      may include an ionizer configured to receive a time-varying
      voltage and provide a fluid medium carrying corresponding
      time-varying electrical charge or voltage to or in proximity to
      the flame. For example, the ionizer may be configured to impart
      the time-varying electrical charges onto a fuel. Additionally or
      alternatively, the ionizer may be configured to impart the
      time-varying electrical charges onto combustion air. Additionally
      or alternatively, the ionizer may be configured to impart the
      time-varying electrical charges onto one or more types of charge
      carriers and to deliver the one or more types of charge carriers
      to the combustion reaction.<br>
      <br>
      [0018] According to an interpretation, a phase-varying electrical
      energy interchange between the time-varying charge of the flame
      102 and the electrically isolated conductor 106 may correspond to
      an increase in the formation of carbon molecules or carbon
      agglomerations in the flame 102. The carbon molecules or carbon
      agglomerations in the flame may incandesce and increase the
      emissivity of the flame. No increase in soot output from the flame
      102 was seen. According to embodiments, the resultant increase in
      radiation from the flame 102 may be used to increase radiation
      heat transfer to an apparatus or workpiece.<br>
      <br>
      [0019] The system 101 may further include a flame holder 108
      configured to anchor the flame 102. The flame holder 108 may be
      electrically isolated or an electrical insulator. A fuel source
      110 such as a hydrocarbon gas fuel source including a nozzle or
      hole 112 may be configured to stream the hydrocarbon gas past the
      flame holder 108. The hydrocarbon gas fuel source may include an
      electrically insulating pipe or hose 114 configured to
      electrically isolate the nozzle or hole 112 from a relative
      ground.<br>
      <br>
      [0020] A time-varying voltage source 116 may provide a modulated
      voltage to the flame charging system 104. For example, the
      time-varying voltage source 116 may include a microcontroller,
      field-programmable gate array (FPGA), application specific
      integrated circuit (ASIC), state machine, integrated circuits,
      and/or discrete circuitry to output a waveform. The time-varying
      voltage source 116 may further be configured to select the
      waveform responsive to open-loop logic and/or feedback from a
      sensor circuit (not shown). The time-varying voltage source 116
      may further include an amplifier configured to receive the
      waveform and output the time-varying voltage. The flame charging
      system may include a flame energization electrode 104 arranged to
      be in substantially continuous contact with the flame 102 when the
      flame 102 is burning. The time varying voltage and a geometry of
      the flame energization electrode 104 may be selected to
      substantially prevent formation of an electrical arc.<br>
      <br>
      [0021] The time-varying voltage may be selected to cause a
      phase-varying electrical energy interchange between the flame 102
      and the electrically isolated conductor 106. According to an
      explanation, the electrically isolated conductor 106 may be
      arranged in a capacitive relationship with the time-varying charge
      imparted onto the flame. For example, the time-varying voltage may
      be selected to cause a phase-varying capacitive energy storage
      between the flame 102 and the electrically isolated conductor 106.
      Additionally or alternatively, the electrically isolated conductor
      106 may be arranged in an inductive relationship with the
      time-varying charge imparted onto the flame 102. For example, the
      time-varying voltage may be selected to cause a phase-varying
      inductive energy storage or a combined inductive-capacitive energy
      storage between the flame 102 and the electrically isolated
      conductor 106.<br>
      <br>
      [0022] Additionally or alternatively, the time-varying voltage may
      be selected to cause a phase-varying local transition state
      concentration and/or charge balance in the flame. According to an
      embodiment, the phase-varying electrical energy interchange or
      phase-varying local transition state concentration and/or charge
      balance may correspond to a decrease in an average flame
      temperature. The decrease in average flame temperature may be
      viewed as an outcome of a time-varying rate of reaction and/or as
      an outcome of radiating more energy from the flame 102.<br>
      <br>
      [0023] The electrically isolated conductor 106 was found to
      operate as described when configured as a steel ring. According to
      embodiments, the electrically isolated conductor may include a
      ring or ring segment at least partially surrounding the flame. The
      electrically isolated conductor 106 may be arranged to be
      substantially coaxial to the flame.<br>
      <br>
      [0024] The electrically isolated conductor 106 was found to
      operate as described when it was in substantially continuous
      physical contact with the flame. According to another embodiment,
      the electrically isolated conductor 106 may occasionally or
      intermittently come into physical contact with the flame.
      “Physical contact” may be defined as visual contact with a flame
      edge.<br>
      <br>
      [0025] An arrangement corresponding to 101 was operated using a
      hydrocarbon gas flame 102 produced by combustion of propane. Other
      fuels may alternatively or additionally be burned and/or other
      reduction-oxidation reactions may be supported to operate as
      described. For example, the hydrocarbon may include greater than
      or fewer than three carbon atoms. Other illustrative hydrocarbon
      fuels may include natural gas, ethane, butane, liquefied petroleum
      gases, refinery gas or liquid mixtures, gasoline, diesel, fuel
      oil, coal, etc.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] FIG. 2 is a diagram illustrating the system 101 of FIG. 1
      in relationship to a system 201 including a heat transfer surface
      202, according to an embodiment. Accordingly, embodiments may
      include a surface 202 configured to receive radiant energy from
      the flame 102. For example, the surface 202 may comprise a portion
      of an industrial process 201 configured to receive radiant energy
      from the flame 102, a heating system 201 configured to receive
      radiant energy from the flame 102, an electrical power generation
      system 201 configured to receive radiant energy from the flame
      102, a land vehicle, watercraft, or aircraft including an
      apparatus 201 configured to receive radiant energy from the flame
      102, and/or a structure (not shown) configured to hold a workpiece
      202 to receive radiant energy from the flame 102.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] FIG. 3 is a flow chart showing a method 301 for increasing
      radiation from a flame, according to an embodiment. Beginning at
      step 302, a fuel may be provided. For example, providing a fuel
      may include providing a hydrocarbon fuel. Such a hydrocarbon fuel
      may have one to three carbon atoms per molecule, or may have more
      atoms per molecule. While various embodiments may include
      increasing radiation output of flames produced by combusting other
      fuels, low molecular weight hydrocarbon gas fuels are
      illustratively addressed because such fuels typically produce
      flames that are substantially transparent, owing to low emissivity
      of the gas and the reaction intermediates, and thus may
      particularly benefit from methods described herein. According to
      embodiments, the method 301 may be used to increase thermal
      radiation from a natural gas flame.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] Proceeding to step 304, the hydrocarbon fuel may be ignited
      to produce a flame. The method 301 may include premixing air or
      other oxidizer and the fuel (not shown). In some embodiments, the
      flame may include or be a diffusion flame.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] In step 306, the flame may be energized with a time-varying
      voltage or electrical charge. Energizing the flame with a
      time-varying voltage or electrical charge may include driving a
      first electrode near or at least partially in the flame with a
      corresponding time varying voltage. According to embodiments,
      energizing the flame with a time-varying voltage or electrical
      charge may include driving a fuel nozzle or a flame holder with a
      corresponding time varying voltage. Additionally or alternatively,
      energizing the flame with a time-varying voltage or electrical
      charge may include driving an ionizer with the time-varying
      voltage to create the corresponding time-varying electrical
      charge. Additionally or alternatively, energizing the flame with a
      time-varying voltage or electrical charge may include driving an
      ion-ejecting electrode with the time-varying voltage to eject ions
      corresponding time-varying voltage or electrical charge toward or
      onto the flame.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] Various voltage waveforms, amplitudes, and frequencies were
      used in experiments, and others have been hypothesized. It is
      believed that a relatively wide range and combination of
      parameters may be used to increase radiation emissions from the
      flame. According to embodiments, energizing the flame with a
      time-varying voltage may include energizing the flame with a
      periodically-varying voltage at 50 to 10,000 hertz frequency. For
      example, the flame may be energized with a periodically-varying
      voltage at a 50-1000 hertz frequency. It was noted during
      experiments that a 400 hertz frequency resulted in a larger amount
      of radiated energy than did a 50 hertz frequency, other parameters
      being equal.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] Waveforms may similarly be varied. For example, energizing
      the flame with a time-varying voltage may include energizing the
      flame with a square wave, sawtooth wave, sine wave or other
      waveform. It was noted during experiments that a square wave
      resulted in a larger shift to radiated energy than did a
      sinusoidal waveform, other parameters being equal.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] Similarly, voltage and geometry may be varied. According to
      embodiments, energizing the flame with a time-varying voltage may
      include energizing the flame with a 1000 volt to 115,000 volt
      amplitude. For example, the voltage may be between 8000 to 40,000
      volt amplitude. It is believed that larger flames may respond
      favorably to larger voltages.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] Step 306 may further include providing a flame energization
      geometry or control circuitry to substantially prevent arcing. For
      example, the flame energization voltage may be alternated or
      applied in such a way as to not exceed the breakdown voltage of
      the ambient environment or the flame. Exceeding the breakdown
      voltage will produce an electrical spark in a phenomenon known as
      arcing. One approach for reducing arcing may be to smooth all
      edges of the first electrode to avoid charge concentrations that
      may tend to initiate an arc. Another approach may be to control
      voltage with sufficient accuracy to avoid voltage spikes that may
      initiate an arc. Another approach may be to use a feedback circuit
      in combination with a current limiting power supply to cut power
      upon sensing arcing or incipient arcing conditions.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] Proceeding to step 308, an electrical conductor may be
      supported adjacent to the gas flame to cause the flame to emit
      enhanced visible and/or infrared light energy. An example
      electrical conductor 106 may be seen in FIG. 1. The electrical
      conductor may, for example, be in electrical continuity with
      ground through a resistance greater than about one mega-ohm and/or
      may be insulated or isolated from ground. Use of a high resistance
      to ground and/or isolation of the electrical conductor may allow
      the electrical conductor to electrically float.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] Various theories may help explain the behavior described
      herein. For example, the electrical conductor may be in capacitive
      communication with the energized flame. Alternatively or
      additionally, the electrical conductor may be in inductive
      communication with the energized flame. The flame emission
      behavior described herein may involve a periodic energy exchange
      between capacitance and/or inductance and thermal energy of the
      flame. Additionally or alternatively, the electrical conductor may
      operate in combination with the modulated, time-varying charge on
      the flame to reduce the concentration of a transition state due to
      removal of one sign of charge during one half-cycle, and then act
      as a source of some or all of the sign of charge and local
      reaction transition state concentration during the subsequent
      half-cycle. Since soot is electrically conductive and soot
      particles can concentrate electrical fields, an external
      electrical field may increase the precipitation of soot from a
      flame. Ionic mechanisms of soot formation have been postulated in
      the literature, but no mention of external fields has been
      previously suggested. According to embodiments, the time-varying
      voltage may be selected to cause an increase in an incandescing
      soot fraction of the flame.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] An explanation of these alternative or complementary
      theories may be understood by reference to FIG. 4, below.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] According to embodiments, the electrical conductor may
      include a ring surrounding an upper portion of the flame and not
      in contact with the flame.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] Responsive to one or more interactions between the
      electrical conductor adjacent to the flame and the flame
      energization electrode, the flame may emit enhanced visible and/or
      infrared light energy, shown as step 310. According to one
      explanation, interactions between the charge on the flame and the
      conductor may cause the flame to emit enhanced visible or infrared
      light energy responsive increasing the emissivity of reaction
      products and reaction intermediates in the flame. For example,
      increasing radiation from the flame may include shifting a
      reaction path to at least temporarily produce soot. The soot may
      emit black body radiation corresponding to the flame temperature.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] Proceeding to step 312, at least a portion of the radiated
      energy may be transmitted at to an apparatus.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] FIG. 4 is a diagram 401 illustrating a theory explaining
      the behavior of the methods and systems described in conjunction
      with FIGS. 1-3, according to an illustrative embodiment. In the
      diagram 401, voltage, V, is plotted as a function of time, t. A
      first voltage waveform 402, shown as a solid line approximating a
      sine wave, may correspond to a time-varying voltage applied to the
      first electrode described above. When the conductor is allowed to
      float, its voltage may be described by a phase-shifted waveform
      404, shown as a dashed line. As a voltage 402 applied to the first
      electrode increases, the voltage of the conductor 404 may follow.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] During a first half cycle 406 of the system, the voltage
      applied to the flame 402 may lower than the voltage 404
      responsively held by the conductor. During the half cycle 406,
      electrons may be attracted out of at least portions of the flame
      toward the conductor. Similarly, positively charged species may be
      attracted from proximity to the conductor to the flame. Because
      the charge to mass ratio of electrons is so much larger than the
      charge to mass ratio of positive species present in the flame, the
      movement of electrons may be responsible for most or substantially
      all of the effects described herein. The effect of the attraction
      of electrons out of the flame may be viewed in several ways.
      Remaining positive charges may unbalance the local population of
      transition states (excited molecules and intermediates) or
      charges. The positive charge imbalance may tend to be associated
      with carbon molecules or agglomerations, which hold heat produced
      during the previous half-cycle, and emit the heat as radiation.
      According to a second view, some of the energy of the system may
      be temporarily converted to a capacitive and/or inductive energy
      held in a field between the flame and the conductor.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] During a second half cycle 408 of the system, the voltage
      applied to the flame 402 may be higher than the voltage 404
      responsively held by the conductor. During the half cycle 408,
      electrons may be attracted from proximity to the conductor and
      into the flame. During the second half cycle 408, the
      concentration of transition states and/or the charge balance the
      combustion reaction may again be satisfied, causing carbon
      molecules or agglomerations to be consumed. According to the
      second view, energy may be extracted from a capacitive and/or
      inductive energy field to be expressed as heat energy in the
      flame.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] Other theories may also explain the effects described
      herein. For example, it is possible that an increased rate of
      reaction is provided simply by mixing forces as charged species
      stream past and collide with complementary species. A reduced rate
      of reaction may then be seen during portions of the cycle where
      the reactant velocities stagnate and reverse direction.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] Notwithstanding particular mechanisms which may cause the
      described behavior, the behavior described and claimed herein was
      observed experimentally, as may be illustrated by the following
      example(s).<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLES</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>Example 1</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0045] Referring to FIG. 1, in a control experimental apparatus
      variant that did not include the conductor 106, a propane gas
      flame continued to burn substantially transparently when a voltage
      was applied to the energization electrode 104.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0046] Geometry:</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Energization Electrode 104:<br>
      A 3-inch nominal diameter steel pipe was cut to a length of 33/4
      inches. The energization electrode 104 was positioned about 16
      inches above a 0.775-inch diameter hole 112.<br>
      Conductor 106:<br>
      Absent.<br>
      Fuel Source 110:<br>
      A 0.775-inch diameter hole 112 was formed in a threaded 3/4-inch
      steel pipe end. The threaded steel end was mounted on piece of
      3/4-inch steel pipe about 8 inches in length. A non-conductive
      hose 114 was secured to an upstream end of the fuel pipe 110.
      Propane was supplied at a pressure of about 8 PSIG.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0053] Energization:</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      A time-varying voltage was applied as a square wave at a frequency
      of 50-1000 Hz. An indicated voltage of 2-8V was indicated by a
      National Instruments PXI-5412 waveform generator mounted in a
      National Instruments NI PXIe-1062Q chassis. The waveform was
      amplified 4000× by a TREK Model 40/15 high voltage amplifier to
      produce a time-varying relative driving voltage range of 8000 V to
      32000 V at the energization electrode 104.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0055] Observations:</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0056] There was no visible flame difference responsive to the
      applied time-varying voltage.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 2</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0057] Referring again to FIG. 1, an experimental apparatus 101
      included an ungrounded 6 inches steel pipe flange as the conductor
      106. The pipe flange 106 was supported by refractory bricks
      concentric to and at a height of 8 inches above the bottom edge of
      the energization electrode 104.<br>
      <br>
      [0058] The energization electrode 104 was again energized
      according to the parameters given above.<br>
      <br>
      [0059] The apparatus 101 produced a much yellower and surging
      flame. The brightness of the light output was greater when the
      energization electrode 104 was driven with a square wave at 1000
      Hz than a square wave driven at the same voltage at 50 Hz.<br>
      <br>
      [0060] The gap between the top of the energization electrode 104
      and the bottom of the ring 106 was 41/4? axially. Adding a second
      ring 106 on top of the first ring 106 gave no noticeable increase
      in brightness. If anything, adding a second ring diminished the
      brightness somewhat.<br>
      <br>
      [0061] Blue tendrils were noted between the hole 112 and the flame
      holder 108 when a voltage waveform was applied to the energization
      electrode 104 in the presence of the ring 106. No blue tendrils
      were seen when voltage was applied in the absence of the ring 106.
      Electrical isolation of the pipe 110 from ground was measured.
      Some leakage to ground was found, but very little.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 3</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0062] The apparatus of EXAMPLE 2 was modified by grounding the
      ring 106. Upon application of the energization voltage, a very
      brief increase in flame luminosity was noted. The flame did not
      exhibit any sustained increase in luminosity.<br>
