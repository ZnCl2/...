        According to embodiments, a co-fired or multiple fuel combustion
        system is configured to apply an electric field to a combustion
        region corresponding to a second fuel that normally suffers from
        poor combustion and/or high sooting. Application of an AC
        voltage to the combustion region was found to increase the
        extent of combustion and significantly reduce soot evolved from
        the second fuel.<br>
        <br>
        <b>CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        The present application claims priority benefit from U.S.
        Provisional Patent Application No. 61/616,223, entitled
        "MULTIPLE FUEL COMBUSTION SYSTEM AND METHOD", filed March 27,
        2012; which, to the extent not inconsistent with the disclosure
        herein, is incorporated by reference.<br>
        <br>
        <b>SUMMARY</b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        According to an embodiment, electro-dynamic and/or electrostatic
        fields may be applied to a co-fired combustion system to enhance
        combustion property(ies). In an example system, a bench-top
        scale model selectively introduced an AC field across a
        simulated tire-derived fuel (TDF) (a cut up bicycle inner-tube)
        held in a crucible over a propane pre-mixed flame. Without the
        electric field, the simulated TDF smoked profusely. With the
        electric field turned on, there was not any visible soot
        (although instrumentation detected a low level of soot). A cause
        and effect relationship was established by repeatedly turning on
        and turning off the electric fields. There was no observable
        hysteresis effect - switch on = no visible soot, switch off =
        visible soot.<br>
        <br>
        According to an embodiment, a co-fired combustion apparatus may
        include a first fuel-introduction body defining a portion of a
        first combustion Docket No.: 2651 -008-04 region. This may
        correspond to the premix nozzle and a flame region, for example.
        The first combustion region may be configured to combust a first
        fuel (e.g., propane) in a first combustion reaction. The
        apparatus may also include a second fuel-introduction body
        defining at least a portion of second combustion region. For
        example, the second fuel-introduction body may include the
        crucible described above. The second combustion region may be
        configured to combust a second fuel in a second combustion
        reaction. The first combustion reaction may be operable to
        sustain the second combustion reaction. For example, the
        simulated TDF was not readily ignited until heated by the
        propane flame. An electrode assembly associated with the second
        combustion region may be operable to be driven to or held at one
        or more first voltages. In the example above, the electrode
        assembly included the metallic crucible itself. A grounded
        4-inch stack that was located approximately axial to the
        crucible may be envisioned as providing an image charge that
        varied to solve a field equation driven by the AC waveform.<br>
        <br>
        Accordingly to another embodiment, a method of co-fired
        combustion may include maintaining the first combustion reaction
        by combusting the first fuel at the first combustion region. In
        other words, the propane combustion reaction C3H8 + 5 O2 -&gt; 3
        CO2 + 4 H 20 may be a self-sustaining exothermic reaction. The
        first combustion region may have a portion thereof defined by
        the first fuel- introducing body. The method may further include
        maintaining a second combustion reaction by combusting a second
        fuel at a second combustion region having a portion defined by a
        second fuel-introducing body. The second combustion may be
        sustained by the first combustion reaction. According to
        embodiments, the method includes applying at least one first
        electrical potential (which may include a time-varying
        electrical potential) proximate the second combustion region.

        </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        In the following detailed description, reference is made to the
        accompanying drawings, which form a part hereof. In the
        drawings, similar symbols typically identify similar components,
        unless context dictates otherwise. The illustrative embodiments
        described in the detailed description, drawings, and claims are
        not meant to be limiting. Other embodiments may be utilized, and
        other changes may be made, without departing from the spirit or
        scope of the subject matter presented here.<br>
        <br>
        FIG. 1 is a diagram of a co-fired combustion apparatus 100,
        according to an embodiment. The apparatus 100 may include a
        first fuel-introduction body 105 defining a portion of first
        combustion region 1 10. The first combustion region 1 10 may be
        configured to combust a first fuel (not shown) in a first
        combustion reaction 1 15. In an embodiment, the first
        fuel-introduction body 105 may be supported in a housing 120 by
        a first fuel-introduction-body support 125. The first fuel may
        be provided by a first fuel supply 130. The first fuel may be
        substantially liquid or gaseous. For example, the first fuel may
        include at least one of natural gas, propane, oil, or coal. In
        an embodiment, the first fuel- Docket No.: 2651 -008-04
        introduction body 105 may comprise a burner assembly that is
        configured to support a flame.<br>
        <br>
        A second fuel-introduction body 135 may define a portion of a
        second combustion region 140. The second combustion region 140
        may be configured to combust a second fuel 145 in a second
        combustion reaction 150. In an embodiment, the second
        fuel-introduction body 135 may comprise a crucible assembly,
        which may be operable to hold the second fuel 145.
        Alternatively, the second fuel-introduction body 135 may include
        a grate, a screen, a fluidized bed support, or another apparatus
        configured to introduce, contain and/or hold the second fuel 145
        proximate the second combustion region 140. The second fuel-
        introduction body 135 may be supported in the housing 120 by a
        second fuel- introduction-body support 155. In an embodiment,
        the second fuel 145 may be substantially solid under standard
        conditions. The second fuel 145 may melt, melt and vaporize,
        sublime, and/or be dried responsive to heating from the first
        combustion reaction 1 15. In an embodiment, the second fuel 145
        may include one or more of rubber, wood, glycerin, an industrial
        waste stream, a post- consumer waste stream, an industrial
        by-product, garbage, hazardous waste, human waste, animal waste,
        animal carcasses, forestry residue, batteries, tires, waste
        plant material, or landfill waste. In an embodiment, the second
        fuel 145 may be fluidized to form at least a portion of a
        fluidized bed.<br>
        <br>
        In an embodiment, the first combustion reaction 1 15 may sustain
        the second combustion reaction 150. For example, the first
        combustion reaction 1 15 may generate heat which initiates or
        supports the second combustion reaction 150. Accordingly, in an
        embodiment, the first fuel-introduction body 105 may be
        positioned at a distance proximate to the second
        fuel-introduction body 135 so that the first combustion reaction
        1 15 may support the second combustion reaction 150. In an
        embodiment, a portion of the apparatus 100 may be enclosed
        within a flue, stack, or pipe configured to convey at least a
        portion of a combustion product stream generated by the first
        and/or second combustion reactions 1 15, 150. Docket No.: 2651
        -008-04<br>
        <br>
        According to an embodiment, the first combustion region 1 10 may
        be substantially separated from the second combustion region
        140. According to another embodiment, the first combustion
        region 1 10 may extend to overlap or occupy the entirety of the
        second combustion region 140. According to an embodiment, the
        first combustion reaction 1 15 may provide ignition for the
        second combustion reaction 150.<br>
        <br>
        An electrode assembly 160 associated with the second combustion
        region 140 may be operable to be driven to or held at one or
        more first voltages such as a constant (DC) voltage, a modulated
        voltage, an alternating polarity (AC) voltage, or a modulated
        voltage with a DC voltage offset. In an embodiment, the
        electrode assembly 160 may comprise at least a portion of one or
        more of the second fuel-introduction body 135, the second
        fuel-introduction-body support 155, the housing 120, or an
        electrode (not shown) separate from the second fuel-
        introduction body 135, the second fuel-introduction body support
        155, and the housing 120. In an embodiment, any of the second
        fuel-introduction body 135, the second fuel-introduction-body
        support 155, the housing 120, or a separate electrode assembly
        160 may each be configured to be driven to or held at one or
        more voltage(s), which may or may not be the same voltage. For
        example, the housing 120 may be held at a ground voltage and the
        second fuel-introduction- body support 155 may be held at or
        driven to positive and/or negative voltages. In an embodiment,
        the housing 120 may rest on a grounding plate 180, which may
        ground the housing 120.<br>
        <br>
        It was found that the smoke reduction was most pronounced when
        the first voltage included a high voltage greater than +1000
        volts and/or less than -1000 volts. For example, in experiments,
        the voltage was an AC waveform with amplitude of +/- 10
        kilovolts. Other high voltages may be used according to
        preferences of the system designer and/or operating engineer.<br>
        <br>
        The electrode assembly 160 may be configured to be driven to or
        held at a voltage produced by a voltage source including a power
        supply 165. The power supply 165 may be operatively coupled to
        controller 170, which is configured to drive or control the
        electrode assembly 160. In some embodiments, the Docket No.:
        2651 -008-04 electrode assembly 160 may include one or more
        electrodes positioned proximate to the second combustion region
        140, which may or may not directly contact the second
        fuel-introduction body 135 or the second fuel 145. Such
        electrodes may be positioned in any desirable arrangement or
        configuration. In an embodiment, a portion of the first
        fuel-introduction body 105, a portion of the first
        fuel-introduction-body support 125, or a portion of an electrode
        (not shown) proximate to the first combustion region 1 10 may be
        configured to be held at one or more second voltage(s).<br>
        <br>
        The apparatus 100 may optionally include one or more sensor(s)
        175 operable to sense one or more conditions of the apparatus
        100, components thereof, and/or the second fuel 145 combustion
        reaction 150. For example, a sensor 145 may sense heat, voltage,
        fluid flow, fluid turbulence, humidity, particulate matter, or
        one or more compounds or species. In an embodiment, the sensor
        175 may be used to sense the condition or state of a combustion
        product stream generated by the second combustion reaction 150.
        A sensed state or condition of the combustion product stream
        generated by the second combustion reaction 150 may be used by a
        feedback controller 170 to modify or modulate the one or more
        voltages and/or waveforms that the electrode assembly 160 is
        held at or driven to.<br>
        <br>
        For example, as further discussed herein, driving or holding the
        electrode assembly 160 at one or more voltages may affect the
        second combustion reaction 150. Driving or holding the electrode
        assembly 160 at one or more voltages may modify the efficiency,
        rate, thermal output, or turbulence, of the second combustion
        reaction 150. The sensor(s) 175 may be operable to detect such
        effects.<br>
        <br>
        It was found that applying an electric field proximate to a
        combustion reaction may be used to improve the efficiency of the
        combustion reaction. The improvement in efficiency may include a
        reduction in undesirable combustion products such as unburned
        fuel, oxides of sulfur (SOx), oxides of nitrogen (???),
        hydrocarbons, and other species. Additionally, the improvement
        in efficiency may include an increase in thermal energy
        generated by the combustion reaction Docket No.: 2651 -008-04
        per the amount of fuel. In addition to being less harmful to the
        environment, supporting a cleaner combustion reaction may result
        in lower operating expense. Discharge of certain combustion
        pollutants may require the purchase of emission-permits for an
        amount of pollutant discharge. Reducing pollutant discharge in a
        given reaction may therefore allow a business to obtain fewer
        emission-permits and/or output more heat at a reduced cost.
        Additionally or alternatively, less fuel may be consumed to
        generate an equivalent amount of energy.<br>
        <br>
        Increased efficiency of a combustion reaction may occur via one
        or more mechanisms. For example, applying an electric field
        proximate to a combustion reaction may increase the number of
        collisions between reactants, which may increase the reaction
        rate. In one example, applying an electric field proximate to a
        combustion reaction may increase the collision energy of
        reactants and therefore increase the rate of reaction. In
        another example, applying an electric field proximate to a
        combustion reaction may provide a self-catalysis effect for
        various desirable reactions and may reduce the reaction
        activation energy by urging reactants to come together in a
        correct reaction orientation. In a further example, applying an
        electric field proximate to a combustion reaction may increase
        the turbulence of a reaction and thereby increase the mixture or
        introduction rate of reactants {e.g., increased mixing of oxygen
        with fuel), which may promote a more efficient or complete
        combustion reaction {e.g., where reactants combust to produce a
        greater proportion of desired reaction products, fewer unreacted
        reactants and undesired products or by-products of the
        combustion reaction will be emitted).<br>
        <br>
        FIG. 2 is a diagram of a co-fired combustion apparatus 200,
        according to an embodiment. The apparatus 200 may include a
        first fuel-introduction body 105 defining a portion of first
        combustion region 1 10. The first combustion region 1 10 may be
        configured to combust a first fuel from a first fuel supply 130
        in a first combustion reaction 1 15. In an embodiment, the first
        fuel-introduction body 105 may be supported in a housing 120 by
        a first fuel-introduction-body support 125. Docket No.: 2651
        -008-04<br>
        <br>
        The apparatus 200 may also include a second fuel-introduction
        body 135 defining a portion of a second combustion region 140.
        The second combustion region 140 may be configured to combust a
        second fuel (not shown) in a second combustion reaction (not
        shown). In an embodiment, the second fuel- introduction body 135
        may comprise a crucible assembly, which may be configured to
        hold the second fuel. Alternatively, the second
        fuel-introduction body 135 may include a grate, a screen, a
        fluidized bed support, or another apparatus configured to
        introduce and/or contain or hold the second fuel proximate the
        second combustion region 140. The apparatus may also include a
        stoker 210, configured to introduce the second fuel to the
        fuel-introduction body 135.<br>
        <br>
        For example, in an embodiment, the second fuel may comprise
        timber waste products, and the stoker 210 may be configured to
        convey timber waste products into the fuel-introduction body 135
        so that sufficient second fuel is present to sustain a
        relatively constant combustion fuel volume within the second
        fuel-introduction body 135. For example, as the second fuel is
        consumed, additional second fuel may be introduced by the stoker
        210 so that the second combustion reaction may continue.
        Optionally, the second fuel-introduction body 135 may include a
        containment body 160B configured to prevent entrainment of
        unburned second fuel particles in flue gas exiting through the
        top of the body 120.<br>
        <br>
        In another embodiment, the second fuel may include black liquor,
        such as a residue from a sulfite pulp mill. The stoker 210 may
        be configured to convey liquid or semi-solid black liquor to the
        second combustion region 140.<br>
        <br>
        Optionally, the burner 200 may include a heat recovery system
        including one or more heat transfer surfaces such as water tube
        boiler tubes to convert heat output by the second (not shown)
        and/or first combustion reaction 1 15 to heated water or steam.
        According to an embodiment, the application of electrical energy
        to at least the second combustion reaction (not shown) may
        reduce tendency for combustion byproducts or entrained materials
        to be deposited on Docket No.: 2651 -008-04 heat transfer
        surfaces. This may allow a longer operating duration between
        service shut-downs to clean heat transfer surfaces.<br>
        <br>
        A first and second electrode assembly 160A, 160B associated with
        the second combustion region 140 may be operable to be driven to
        or held at one or more voltages using a substantially constant
        (DC) voltage, a modulated voltage, an alternating polarity (AC)
        voltage, or a modulated voltage with DC voltage offset. The
        first electrode 160A assembly may be configured to be driven to
        or held at one or more first voltages. The second electrode 160B
        assembly may be configured to be driven to or held at one or
        more second voltages. In an embodiment, the first and second one
        or more voltages may be the same.<br>
        <br>
        The first and second electrode assemblies 160A, 160B may be
        electrically isolated from a portion of the housing 120 via
        respective insulators and/or air gaps 220A, 220B. In an
        embodiment, the first and second electrode assembly<br>
        <br>
        160A, 160B may be held or driven to a first and second voltage
        respectively, and the housing 120 may be held at or driven to a
        third voltage. For example, the housing 120 may be held at
        ground potential via a grounding plate 180.<br>
        <br>
        The first and second electrode assembly 160A, 160B may each be
        configured to be driven to or held at a voltage produced by a
        voltage source including a power supply 165. The power supply
        165 may be operatively coupled to controller 170, which may be
        configured to control the output voltage, current, and/or
        waveform(s) output by the power supply 165 to the first and/or
        second electrode assemblies 160A, 160B.<br>
        <br>
        The apparatus 200 may optionally include a first and/or second
        sensor<br>
        <br>
        170A, 170B operable to sense one or more conditions of the
        apparatus 200 or components thereof. For example, the first
        sensor 170A may be associated with the first electrode assembly
        160A, and the second sensor 170B may be associated with the
        second electrode assembly 160B.<br>
        <br>
        FIG. 3 is a flow chart showing a method 300 for operating a
        co-fired combustion system, according to an embodiment. The
        method 300 begins in block 310 where a first combustion is
        maintained at a first combustion region by combusting a first
        fuel. For example, referring to FIGS. 1 and 2, the first Docket
        No.: 2651 -008-04 combustion 1 15 may be maintained at the first
        fuel-introduction body 105 in the first combustion region 1 10.
        The first fuel may be a relatively free-burning fuel such as a
        hydrocarbon gas, a hydrocarbon liquid, or coal. The first fuel
        should be chosen to have a flame temperature that is
        sufficiently high to support and/or ignite combustion of the
        second fuel.<br>
        <br>
        The method 300 continues in block 320, where a second combustion
        reaction is sustained by heat and/or ignition from the first
        combustion reaction. The second combustion reaction may be
        maintained at a second combustion region by combusting the
        second fuel. For example referring to FIGS. 1 and 2, the second
        combustion reaction 150 may be sustained by the first combustion
        reaction 1 15, at the second fuel-introduction body 135 in the
        second combustion region 140. According to an embodiment, heat
        from the first combustion reaction may dry, volatilized, and/or
        raise a vapor pressure of the second fuel sufficiently to allow
        the second fuel to burn. Additionally or alternatively, the
        first combustion region may overlap with or contain the second
        combustion region. The first combustion reaction may provide
        ignition and/or maintain combustion of the second fuel.<br>
        <br>
        The method 300 continues in block 330 where a first potential or
        sequence of potentials is applied to a first electrode
        operatively coupled to the second combustion region. For
        example, referring to FIG. 1 a first potential or sequence of
        potentials may be applied to the electrode assembly 160
        proximate to the second combustion region 140. Referring to FIG.
        2, a first potential may be applied to the first electrode
        assembly 160A proximate to the second combustion region 140.
        According to an embodiment, the first potential or sequence of
        potentials may include a substantially constant (DC) voltage, a
        modulated voltage, an alternating polarity (AC) voltage, or a
        modulated voltage with DC voltage offset.<br>
        <br>
        The method 300 continues in block 340, where a second electrical
        potential or sequence of potentials is applied to a second
        electrode operatively coupled to the second combustion region.
        For example, referring to FIG. 1 a second potential may be
        applied to the housing 120 proximate to the second Docket No.:
        2651 -008-04 combustion region 140. Referring to FIG. 2, a
        second potential may be applied to the second electrode assembly
        160B proximate to the second combustion region 140.<br>
        <br>
        The electrical potentials applied in steps 330 and 340 may be
        selected to cause an increase in reaction rate and/or an
        increase in the reaction extent reached by the second combustion
        reaction. According to an embodiment, the first electrical
        potential or sequence of potentials may include a time-varying
        high voltage. The high voltage may be greater than 1000 volts
        and/or less than -1000 volts. According to an embodiment, the
        high voltage may include a polarity- changing waveform with an
        amplitude of +/1 10,000 volts or greater. The waveform may be a
        periodic waveform having a frequency of between 50 and 300
        Hertz, for example. In another example, the waveform may be a
        periodic waveform having a frequency of between 300 and 1000
        Hertz. According to an embodiment, the second electrical
        potential may be a substantially constant (DC) ground potential.<br>
        <br>
        The method is shown looping from step 340 back to step 310. In a
        real embodiment, the steps 310, 320, 330, and 340 are generally
        performed simultaneously and continuously while the second fuel
        is being burned (after start-up and before shut-down).<br>
        <br>
        <b>EXAMPLE</b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        Referring to FIG. 1 , a burner assembly 105 was disposed within
        a cylindrical housing 120, defining a first combustion region 1
        10. The burner assembly 105 was operatively connected to a
        propane gas supply (first fuel supply 130), which was used to
        sustain a propane flame on the burner assembly 105 in a first
        combustion 1 15. The housing 120 was approximately 3 inches in
        diameter and approximately 1 foot tall. The burner assembly 105
        was substantially cylindrical having a diameter of approximately
        3/4 inch, and a height of approximately 1 inch. Docket No.: 2651
        -008-04<br>
        <br>
        A crucible 135 having a diameter of approximately 3/4 inch was
        positioned within the housing 120 above the propane first
        combustion 1 15. The crucible 135 held a mass of rubber pieces
        (second fuel 145), which were obtained by cutting pieces from a
        bicycle inner-tube. The propane first combustion 1 15 caused the
        rubber pieces to ignite, thus generating a second combustion
        150. The second combustion 150 of the rubber pieces generated a
        combustion product stream (not shown), which visually presented
        as black smoke. The housing 120 was used to contain and direct
        the combustion product stream, and rested on a grounding plate
        180, which held the housing 120 at a ground voltage.<br>
        <br>
        A modulated voltage of 10kV was then applied to the crucible 135
        at a frequency of 300-1000Hz. The smoke generated by the
        combustion of the rubber pieces changed from a black smoke to no
        visible smoke. This indicated that the combustion product stream
        included fewer particulates. The voltage was removed from the
        crucible 135 and the combustion product stream again presented
        as black smoke. The voltage was again applied to the crucible
        135 and the combustion product stream again presented as a
        lighter or substantially no visible smoke.<br>
        <br>
        In a first particulate-residue trial, a first volume of rubber
        pieces was burned in the crucible 135 and a first paper filter
        was positioned on the top end of the housing 120 to collect
        particulate matter in the combustion product stream. A voltage
        was not applied to the crucible 135.<br>
        <br>
        In a second particulate-residue trial, a second volume of rubber
        pieces (having substantially the same mass as the first volume
        of the first trial) was burned in the crucible 135 and a second
        paper filter was positioned on the top end of the housing 120 to
        collect particulate matter. A modulated voltage of 10kV was then
        applied to the crucible 135 at a frequency of 300-1000Hz.<br>
        <br>
        The first and second filter papers were compared, and the first
        filter paper exhibited a substantial layer of black particulate
        matter. The second filter paper on exhibited a light
        discoloration of the paper, but did not have a layer of
        particulate matter. This result further indicated that the
        application of the voltage Docket No.: 2651 -008-04 created a
        substantial reduction in particulate matter in the combustion
        product stream of the combusting rubber pieces.<br>
        <br>
        In a first heat-exchange trial, a first volume of rubber pieces
        was burned in the crucible 135 and thermographic images of the
        combustion were recorded over time using a Fluke ??20 Thermal
        Analyzer at a perspective substantially the same as the
        perspective of FIG. 1. A propane fuel volume of 0.4 actual cubic
        feet per hour (acfh) was supplied to the burner assembly 105
        during the trial. A voltage was not applied to the crucible 135.<br>
        <br>
        In a second heat-exchange trial, a second volume of rubber
        pieces (having substantially the same mass as the first volume
        of the first trial) was burned in the crucible 135 and
        thermographic images of the combustion were recorded over time
        using a Fluke ??20 Thermal Analyzer at a perspective
        substantially the same as the perspective of FIG. 1. A propane
        fuel volume of 0.2 actual cubic feet per hour (acfh) was
        supplied to the burner assembly 105 during the trial (i.e., half
        of the fuel compared to the first trial). A modulated voltage of
        10kV was then applied to the crucible 135 at a frequency of 300-
        1000Hz.<br>
        <br>
        The thermographic images of the first and second heat-exchange
        trial were compared over time. At 15 seconds, both burners
        registered approximately 130 &lt;°&gt;F. At 45 seconds the first
        heat-exchange trial continued to register 130 &lt;°&gt;F; the
        second heat-exchange trial burner (with 50% fuel) registered
        approximately 186 &lt;°&gt;F. These trials indicated that even
        with 50% fuel volume, application of a voltage to the crucible
        135 generated a higher combustion temperature.<br>
        <br>
        In a third heat-exchange trial, a volume of rubber pieces was
        burned in the crucible 135 and thermographic images of the
        combustion were recorded over time using a Fluke Ti20 Thermal
        Analyzer at a perspective substantially the same as the
        perspective of FIG. 1. Over time, a modulated voltage of 10kv
        was then applied to the crucible 135 at a frequency of 300 Hz
        for a period of time; the voltage was removed for a period of
        time; a modulated voltage of 10kv was then applied to the
        crucible 135 at a frequency of 1000 Hz for a period of time; and
        the voltage was removed for a period of time. The application
        and removal of these Docket No.: 2651 -008-04 voltages was
        repeated six times. An image was captured at the end of each
        period.<br>
        <br>
        FIGS. 4-27 depict the thermographic images captured during the
        heat- exchange trial from a time of 9:27:16 until 10:52:16 and
        show that application of a voltage to the crucible 135 generated
        a higher combustion temperature.<br>
        <br>
        Schlieren photography was used to visualize the flow of the
        combustion product stream generated by the combustion of rubber
        pieces within the crucible 135. When no voltage was applied to
        the crucible 135, the flow of the combustion product stream
        appeared to be laminar flow; however, when a modulated voltage
        of 10kV was then applied to the crucible 135 at a frequency of
        300-1000Hz, the combustion product stream appeared to have
        turbulent flow. In other words, the combustion product stream
        behaved according to a low<br>
        <br>
        Reynolds number, laminar flow regime when no voltage was
        applied, and exhibited a high amount of turbulence evocative of
        a high Reynolds number when a voltage was applied, even though
        mass flow rates were nearly identical.<br>
