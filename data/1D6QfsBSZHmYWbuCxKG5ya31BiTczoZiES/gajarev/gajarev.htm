    <blockquote>Russian biophysicist and molecular biologist Pjotr
      Garjajev and his colleagues have been carrying out cutting-edge
      research the more esoteric nature of DNA. They simply did not
      believe that 90% of our DNA is ‘Junk DNA’. From the German book
      Vernetzte Intelligenz by Grazyna Fosar and Franz Bludorf
      (summarised and translated by Baerbel): </blockquote>
    <blockquote>The latest research explains phenomena such as
      clairvoyance, intuition, spontaneous and remote acts of healing,
      self healing, affirmation techniques, unusual light-auras around
      people (namely spiritual masters), mind's influence on
      weather-patterns and much more. The Russian scientists also found
      out that our DNA can cause disturbing patterns in the vacuum, thus
      producing magnetized wormholes! Wormholes are the microscopic
      equivalents of the so-called Einstein-Rosen bridges in the
      vicinity of black holes (left by burned-out stars). These are
      tunnel connections between entirely different areas in the
      universe through which information can be transmitted outside of
      space and time. The DNA attracts these bits of information and
      passes them on to our consciousness... </blockquote>
    <blockquote>Russian researcher Dr.Vladimir Poponin put DNA in a tube
      and beamed a laser through it. When the DNA was removed, the laser
      light continued spiralling on its own, like it would through a
      crystal! This effect is called ‘Phantom DNA Effect’. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>It is surmised that energy from outside of space and
      time still flows through the activated wormholes after the DNA was
      removed. The side effect encountered most often in hyper
      communication and also in human beings are inexplicable
      electromagnetic fields in the vicinity of the persons concerned.
      Electronic devices like CD players and the like can be irritated
      and cease to function for hours. When the electromagnetic field
      slowly dissipates, the devices function normally again. Many
      healers and psychics know this effect from their work.<br>

    <blockquote><b>Junk DNA</b> </blockquote>
    <blockquote>While western science invested in the International
      Human Genome Project focusing on the 5% of the encoding triplets
      of DNA, in the Soviet Union in 1990 a group of Russian scientists
      of the Russian Academy of Sciences was formed to study the
      complete human genome. This research was led by Dr. Pjotr
      Garjajev, member of the Russian Academy of Sciences as well as the
      Academy of Sciences in New York. The Russian research was taking a
      wide angle and held an open view in their studies. The research
      team included bio physicists, molecular biologists, embryologists
      and even linguistic experts. Their research revealed that the
      supposed junk DNA that has been completely neglected and forgotten
      by western mainstream science, was no redundant leftover of
      evolution at all. Linguistic studies revealed that the sequencing
      of the codons of the non-coding DNA follow the rules of some basic
      syntax. There is a definite structure and logic in the sequence of
      these triplets, like some biological language. Research further
      revealed that the codons actually form words and sentences just
      like our ordinary human language follows grammar rules. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>Scientists have conducted much research on the origins
      of human languages and the origins of the grammatical rules that
      are so essential to all human languages; however they have always
      failed to find the source. But now for the first time in history
      the origins of language may be surprisingly attributed to DNA. The
      language of the genes is much, much older than any human language
      that was ever uttered on this globe. It is even conceivable that
      the DNA grammar itself served as the blueprint for the development
      of human speech. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>Whereas the western Human Genome Project deciphered the
      ‘machine language’ code of the DNA molecule, the structure of the
      DNA ‘bits’ formed by the sequence of nucleotides, Russian scholars
      discovered the higher level language present in DNA. Another
      amazing fact that Garjajev’s group discovered was that the DNA is
      by no means a closed book of life. He discovered that the text of
      the DNA book can be altered. The codons of the DNA string can be
      rearranged in different sequences. In other words the software of
      the human genome our DNA molecule can be reprogrammed! Research
      revealed that the triplets in the DNA string are able to exchange
      places. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>Since the DNA was found to have a syntax and semantics
      akin to our human languages, it indicated that our currently
      restricted understanding of DNA serving only for the coding of the
      reproduction of proteins for the chemical make up of an organism,
      is only half of the story. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>When in vitro DNA in test tubes was exposed to coherent
      laser light, the laser light spiralled along the DNA helix as if
      it was guided by the structure of the DNA molecule. The most
      amazing effect was noticed when the DNA itself was removed and the
      laser light kept spiralling! The vacuum of the space that was just
      previously occupied by the DNA had changed and something caused
      the laser light to keep spiralling. These effects have been
      measured and remained for quite some time after the DNA was
      removed. The effect is now becoming well known as the DNA phantom
      effect. Vladimir Poponin and his team of Russian Academy of
      Sciences repeated the work of Garjajev at the Hearthmath Institute
      in the U.S.A. Poponin concluded again that a field structure was
      formed in the physical vacuum even when the original DNA was
      removed. We’ve seen similar examples of vacuum changes before that
      could be attributed to torsion fields. (1) </blockquote>
    <blockquote><b>DNA programming</b> </blockquote>
    <blockquote>The most astonishing experiment that was performed by
      Garjajev’s group is the reprogramming of the DNA codon sequences
      using modulated laser light. From their discovered grammatical
      syntax of the DNA language they were able to modulate coherent
      laser light and even radio waves and add semantics (meaning) to
      the carrier wave. In this way they were able to reprogram in vivo
      DNA in living organisms, by using the correct resonant frequencies
      of DNA. The most impressive discovery made so far is that spoken
      language can be modulated to the carrier wave with the same
      reprogramming effect. Now this is a baffling and stunning
      scientific discovery! Our own DNA can simply be reprogrammed by
      human speech, supposing that the words are modulated on the
      correct carrier frequencies! </blockquote>
    <blockquote>Whereas western science uses complicated bio chemical
      processes to cut and paste DNA triplets in the DNA molecule,
      Russian scientist use modulated laser light to do exactly the same
      thing. The Russians have proven to be very successful in repairing
      damaged DNA material in vivo! </blockquote>
    <blockquote>Laser light therapies based on Garjajev’s findings are
      already applied in some European academic hospitals with success
      on various sorts of skin cancer. The cancer is cured without any
      remaining scars. <br>

    <blockquote>"...In truth, DNA is not just a blueprint for
      constructing the body; it is also a storage medium for optical
      information as well as an organ for communication. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>The German biophysicist Fritz-Albert Popp spent many
      years studying biophoton emission, i.e., the light that the body
      naturally emits. Popp’s studies indicate that DNA is one of the
      main suppliers of biophotons. Through comprehensive studies, he
      discovered that DNA is a harmonic oscillator – an oscillating
      system with its own particular frequency, or resonating frequency.
      Using the length of the DNA molecule (about two meters, when
      stretched out), and the known speed of light, DNA’s own frequency
      is calculated as about 150 megahertz... </blockquote>
    <blockquote>The principles have been worked out by Dr. Piotr P.
      Garjajev and his colleagues at the Russian Academy of Science in
      Moscow. </blockquote>
    <blockquote><b>Genes Speak Our Language</b> </blockquote>
    <blockquote>Garjajev’s findings go far beyond Popp’s: According to
      Garjajev’s studies, DNA is not only the transmitter and receiver
      of electromagnetic radiation (in the form of energy), but it also
      absorbs information contained in the radiation and interprets it
      further. Thus, DNA is an extremely complex interactive optical
      biochip. In our book Vernetzte Intelligenz (Cross-Linked
      Intelligence) we wrote the following on this subject: </blockquote>
    <blockquote>“For example, today we speak almost matter-of-factly
      about the “genetic code,” that is, about a systematic codification
      of information. However, genetics to date has gotten stuck at this
      point, and has relied exclusively on chemistry to finish the work,
      without even once calling in language experts. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>“In Moscow, things are different. There, the genetic
      code was…additionally subjected to thorough examination by
      linguists. (Linguistics is the science of the structure and
      formation of languages). When studying a language, people
      investigate regularities such as syntax (rules for building words
      from letters), semantics (the study of the content meaning of
      words), and rules of grammar. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>“When this scientific knowledge is applied to the
      genetic code, it can be seen that this code follows the same rules
      as our human languages. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>“It should be noted: not the rules of a particular
      language (in this case, for example, the Russian language), but
      rather rules at a fundamental level where common features reside
      among all existing languages of mankind. Thus, the structure of
      the genetic code can be connected with every existing human
      language. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>“Scientists have been seeking the ancestral human
      language for centuries – Piotr Garjajev and his colleagues may
      have found it.” <br>

    <blockquote>The human DNA is a biological Internet and superior in
      many aspects to the artificial one. The latest Russian scientific
      research directly or indirectly explains phenomena such as
      clairvoyance, intuition, spontaneous and remote acts of healing,
      self healing, affirmation techniques, unusual light/auras around
      people (namely spiritual masters), mind´s influence on weather
      patterns and much more. In addition, there is evidence for a whole
      new type of medicine in which DNA can be influenced and
      reprogrammed by words and frequencies WITHOUT cutting out and
      replacing single genes. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>Only 10% of our DNA is being used for building proteins.
      It is this subset of DNA that is of interest to western
      researchers and is being examined and categorized. The other 90%
      are considered "junk DNA." The Russian researchers, however,
      convinced that nature was not dumb, joined linguists and
      geneticists in a venture to explore those 90% of "junk DNA." Their
      results, findings and conclusions are simply revolutionary! </blockquote>
    <blockquote>According to them, our DNA is not only responsible for
      the construction of our body but also serves as data storage and
      in communication. The Russian linguists found that the genetic
      code, especially in the apparently useless 90%, follows the same
      rules as all our human languages. To this end they compared the
      rules of syntax (the way in which words are put together to form
      phrases and sentences), semantics (the study of meaning in
      language forms) and the basic rules of grammar. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>They found that the alkalines of our DNA follow a
      regular grammar and do have set rules just like our languages. So
      human languages did not appear coincidentally but are a reflection
      of our inherent DNA. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>The Russian biophysicist and molecular biologist Pjotr
      Garjajev and his colleagues also explored the vibrational behavior
      of the DNA. [For the sake of brevity I will give only a summary
      here. For further exploration please refer to the appendix at the
      end of this article.] The bottom line was: "Living chromosomes
      function just like solitonic/holographic computers using the
      endogenous DNA laser radiation." This means that they managed for
      example to modulate certain frequency patterns onto a laser ray
      and with it influenced the DNA frequency and thus the genetic
      information itself. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>Since the basic structure of DNA-alkaline pairs and of
      language (as explained earlier) are of the same structure, no DNA
      decoding is necessary. One can simply use words and sentences of
      the human language! This, too, was experimentally proven! Living
      DNA substance (in living tissue, not in vitro) will always react
      to language-modulated laser rays and even to radio waves, if the
      proper frequencies are being used. This finally and scientifically
      explains why affirmations, autogenous training, hypnosis and the
      like can have such strong effects on humans and their bodies. It
      is entirely normal and natural for our DNA to react to language.
      While western researchers cut single genes from the DNA strands
      and insert them elsewhere, the Russians enthusiastically worked on
      devices that can influence the cellular metabolism through
      suitable modulated radio and light frequencies and thus repair
      genetic defects. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>Garjajev´s research group succeeded in proving that with
      this method chromosomes damaged by x-rays for example can be
      repaired. They even captured information patterns of a particular
      DNA and transmitted it onto another, thus reprogramming cells to
      another genome. So they successfully transformed, for example,
      frog embryos to salamander embryos simply by transmitting the DNA
      information patterns! This way the entire information was
      transmitted without any of the side effects or disharmonies
      encountered when cutting out and re-introducing single genes from
      the DNA. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>This represents an unbelievable, world-transforming
      revolution and sensation! All this by simply applying vibration
      and language instead of the archaic cutting-out procedure! This
      experiment points to the immense power of wave genetics, which
      obviously has a greater influence on the formation of organisms
      than the biochemical processes of alkaline sequences. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>Esoteric and spiritual teachers have known for ages that
      our body is programmable by language, words and thought. This has
      now been scientifically proven and explained. Of course the
      frequency has to be correct. And this is why not everybody is
      equally successful or can do it with always the same strength. The
      individual person must work on the inner processes and maturity in
      order to establish a conscious communication with the DNA. The
      Russian researchers work on a method that is not dependent on
      these factors but will ALWAYS work, provided one uses the correct
      frequency. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>But the higher developed an individual´s consciousness
      is, the less need is there for any type of device! One can achieve
      these results by oneself, and science will finally stop to laugh
      at such ideas and will confirm and explain the results. And it
      doesn´t end there. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>The Russian scientists also found out that our DNA can
      cause disturbing patterns in the vacuum, thus producing magnetized
      wormholes! Wormholes are the microscopic equivalents of the
      so-called Einstein-Rosen bridges in the vicinity of black holes
      (left by burned-out stars). These are tunnel connections between
      entirely different areas in the universe through which information
      can be transmitted outside of space and time. The DNA attracts
      these bits of information and passes them on to our consciousness.
      This process of hypercommunication is most effective in a state of
      relaxation. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>Stress, worries or a hyperactive intellect prevent
      successful hypercommunication or the information will be totally
      distorted and useless. In nature, hypercommunication has been
      successfully applied for millions of years. The organized flow of
      life in insect states proves this dramatically. Modern man knows
      it only on a much more subtle level as "intuition." But we, too,
      can regain full use of it... </blockquote>

    <blockquote><b>The Biological Chip in our Cells</b> </blockquote>
    <blockquote>Independent of the biochemical function as a protein
      producer the DNA is a complicated electronic biological chip that
      communicates with its environment, as latest research from Russia
      found out. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>In the year 1990 a group of scientists got together in
      Moscow, for whom the study of the human Genoms was too much
      reduced exclusively to biochemistry. They had recognized that by
      this viewpoint, which is based rather on orthodox dogmatism than
      on objective scientific realizations a lot of information remains
      hidden to us. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>Highly-qualified scientists belong to this group, to a
      large extent from the Russian Academy of Sciences. Beside
      physicists of the renowned Lebedev institute also molecular
      biologists participate, bio physicists, geneticists, embryologists
      and linguists. Director of the project is Dr. Pjotr Garjajev, a
      bio physicist and molecular biologist. He is member of the Russian
      Academy of Sciences as well as of the Academy of Sciences in New
      York. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>In the eight years since establishment of the project
      the Muscovite group came to revolutionary realizations, which let
      our understanding of the DNA and the human genetics appear in a
      completely new light. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>For example we speak today nearly naturally of the
      »genetic code«, thus of a systematic information coding. But the
      past genetics stopped here and settled the remainder of the work
      exclusive with the help of chemistry, instead of consulting also
      language experts. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>Differently in Moscow. Here, as already mentioned, the
      genetic code was submitted an exact investigation by linguists
      too. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>Linguistics is the science of the structure of
      languages. It investigates thereby not only the natural languages,
      which developed in the individual countries and cultures, but also
      artificial languages, which are used for example for programming
      computers and which were developed in the past decades
      systematically using linguistic realizations. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>One examines semantics (theory of the meaning of the
      words) and language regularities like the syntax (rules for the
      setting up of words from letters), as well as the bases of the
      grammar. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>If one uses these scientific realizations on the genetic
      code, then one recognizes that this code follows the same rules as
      our human languages. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>Mind you: not the rules of a certain language (in this
      case e.g. the Russian one), but on such a fundamental level, where
      all existing languages of mankind have comparable structures. So
      it is possible to set the structure of the genetic code in
      relationship with each existing language of mankind. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>For centuries scientists looked for the human original
      language - Pjotr Garjajev and his coworkers possibly found it. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>We must turn around the relations: the structure of the
      DNA does not correspond to the human language structure, but the
      human languages follow the genetic code in their structure the
      rules! DNA and genetic code existed already for a long time,
      before first humans spoke an articulated word for the first time!
      Every human languages developed since that time followed the basic
      pattern, already existing in the structure of the genetic code. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>You should not misunderstand this realization: It does
      not concern here an orthodox materialistic conception of the
      world, according to which the ability for speaking would be only a
      secondary effect of proteins, which are put on in some genes. The
      arrangement of the elementary bases in the DNA follows a grammar,
      an immaterial plan, which is similar to the structure of our
      languages. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>The fact that no physical procedure is concerned here is
      proved by the next discovery of Garjajev's team: The analogy
      between the structure of the DNA and the human language is most
      pronounced just in the parts of the giant molecule, which are not
      used for protein synthesis! </blockquote>
    <blockquote>For a long time one knows that only about 10 per cent of
      the DNA molecule are used for setting up genes. The remaining 90
      per cent have a function unknown to classical science and were
      designated so far as »silent DNA«. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>Garjajev's realization thus is a revolution for the
      entire area of genetics. Examining only the well-known genes
      calling the remainder »silent DNA«, you will miss the most
      important facts! It is paradoxical: just the »silent DNA« -
      figurativy spoken - speaks a language! </blockquote>
    <blockquote>In various experiments the Muscovites group could prove
      that these extensive codes in the DNA are not used by any means
      for the synthesis of a so far unknown quantity of components of
      our body, as it is the case with the genes. This code is rather
      actually used for communication, more exactly - for
      hypercommunication. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>Hypercommunication is a data exchange on DNA level using
      genetic code. Since this code possesses a structure, which is the
      basis of all human languages, also higher information may be
      transported, which is able to come up to human consciousness and
      to be interpreted there. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>Garjajev and its colleague continued still another step.
      They analyzed the vibration response of the DNA and found out that
      it follows quite complicated laws, which are however well known in
      the physics for a long time. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>Those are the laws of nonlinear waveform-shaping, known
      since center of 19 century as so-called Soliton waves. They are
      known from observations, but so complicated that they may be
      calculated only with modern computers. Soliton waves are
      temporally extraordinarily stable and may store information in
      this way for a long time. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>Summarizing all these realizations, one comes to a
      perfectly new form of the genetic engineering, possibly even to a
      new gene therapy. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>Concerning this Pjotr Garjajev writes: »The majority
      tries to understand the principles of the DNA biological computer
      by appointing oneself exclusively to the DNA Watson Crick Chargaff
      rules: A-T, G-C. That is correct, but it is so not enough! The DNA
      chromosomale continuum in living systems has wave attributes,
      which lets us derive the unknown, a computer-similar program for
      the setting up of the organisms. The well-known genetic code is a
      code for protein synthesis and nothing further. Chromosomes in
      vivo work as solitonic holographic computers under use of the
      endogenous DNA laser radiation.« </blockquote>
    <blockquote>This sounds like science of the 21st century and
      probably is. But don't forget: Garjajevs statements are founded
      scientifically in theory and experiment. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>The consequences of these realizations are as
      incomprehensible as simple and logical: If one modulates a laser
      beam by a frequency sample, then one may affect with this the
      information of the DNA waves and so the genetic information
      itself. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>For this one does not even need to decode the language
      of the pairs of bases in laborious work, in order to formulate
      from it artificially genetic information, but one can use quite
      easily words and sentences of the human language! The bases of the
      language structures are, as we in now know, the same. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>Also this astonishing conclusion the Muscovites group of
      researchers could prove already experimentally. DNA substance in
      vivo (i.e. in the living fabric, not in the test tube) reacts to
      language-modulated laser light, even to radio waves, if one keeps
      the correct resonant frequencies. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>In this way unknown possibilities are opened to the
      medicine. One may design devices, with which through suitably
      modulated radio or light radiation cell metabolism may be
      affected, even the repair of genetic defects is possible, without
      all the risks and side effects of the classical-biochemical
      proceeding. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>Garjajevs group of researchers could already prove that
      with this method chromosomes may be repaired, which were damaged
      e.g. by x-rays. The effects on medical therapy possibilities of
      the coming century are immense: one can develop devices for new,
      subtle cancer therapy, also for the treatment of aids and for the
      slowing down of the aging process. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>Already today devices are in use also in German
      university clinics, with whose assistance cancer patients are
      exposed to frequency-modulated magnetic field irradiation. The
      results are promising. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>We see here that the objectives of the Muscovites
      researchers deviate from those of the western human Genome Project
      in principle. While in the western science the trend is to develop
      new chemical medicines from as much as possible items of
      information from the genes - a procedure, which is however not
      free from substantial risks, a potential giant business -, the
      Russian scientists have a rather holistic understanding of the DNA
      leading to the development of therapy devices, which may replace
      some expensive and dangerous medicine in the long term. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>Quite beside from the new wave theory of the genetic
      code still some further interesting facts follow. For example one
      knows for a long time that almost any bodily function,
      particularly also in the metabolism and in the hormone production,
      can be affected by suggestive strength of the spoken word,
      although they run perfectly autonomously, thus under elimination
      of the conscious will, whereupon the impact of the medical
      hypnosis is based. These facts are well-known, however could not
      be explained so far scientifically. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>The medical model of the psycho neuro immunology led
      back the effect of hypnotic suggestions so far exclusively to
      control mechanisms in the brain, particularly in the regions,
      which are assumed to contain subconscious layers. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>Now it looks that it is much simpler: the DNA is able to
      react directly to the spoken word. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>Also different therapy procedures, whose impact was
      inexplicable so far, as for instance the Chinese acupunkture, may
      be explained with help of the DNA wave theory in Garjajev's
      opinion scientifically. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>If we summarize the research results of Professor Popp
      and Professor Garjajev, then a remarkable connection results:
      Light actually represents an important factor in the power supply
      of our hereditary molecule, the DNA. It provides healthy
      functioning of all procedures in our cells. However it cannot form
      a complete replacement for material food alone. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>The information, which will transfer via the light, is
      much more important. The DNA communicates in this way - perhaps
      with other organisms or with a superordinate plan - which a
      morphogenetic field, which could be proven by the research in
      Russia for the first time scientifically. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>In this way the genetic information of each cell can
      employ comparisons of their actual condition with a specified
      condition each time and arrange possibly necessary repairs. This
      can prevent or at least stop diseases such as cancer or aids, in
      addition, slow down the age process. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>The modern wave genetics is one of the key technologies
      for the coming millennium, and we can be strained, what science
      will discover in this area in the very near future. </blockquote>

    <blockquote style="text-align: justify;">This paper reports
      experimental work carried out in Moscow at the Institute of

      several sources. This work changes the notion about the genetic
      code essentially. It asserts: - </blockquote>
    <blockquote style="text-align: justify;">1) That the evolution of
      biosystems has created genetic "texts", similar to natural context
      dependent texts in human languages, shaping the text of these
      speech-like patterns. </blockquote>
    <blockquote style="text-align: justify;">2) That the chromosome
      apparatus acts simultaneously both as a source and receiver of
      these genetic texts, respectively decoding and encoding them, and
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote style="text-align: justify;">3) That the chromosome
      continuum of multicellular organisms is analogous to a
      static-dynamical multiplex time-space holographic grating, which
      comprises the space-time of an organism in a convoluted form. </blockquote>
    <blockquote style="text-align: justify;">That is to say, the DNA

      similar to human thinking, but at its own genomic level of
      "reasoning". It asserts that natural human texts (irrespectively
      of the language used), and genetic "texts" have similar
      mathematical-linguistic and entropic-statistic characteristics,
      where these concern the fractality of the distribution of the
      character frequency density in the natural and genetic texts, and
      where in case of genetic "texts", the characters are identified
      with the nucleotides, and ii) that DNA molecules, conceived as a

      pre-images of biostructures and of the organism as a whole as a

        Predicts. </strong></blockquote>
    <blockquote style="text-align: left;"><strong>1.1 Introduction. </strong>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote style="text-align: justify;">How did this new theory
      take shape? The principle problem of the creation of the genetic
      code, as seen in all the approaches [Gariaev 1994; Fatmi et al.
      1990; Perez 1991: Clement et al. 1993; Marcer, Schempp 1996;
      Patel, 2000] was to explain the mechanism by means of which a
      third nucleotide in an encoding triplet, is selected. To
      understand, what kind of mechanism resolves this typically
      linguistic problem of removing homonym indefiniteness, it is
      necessary firstly to postulate a mechanism for the context-wave
      orientations of ribosomes in order to resolve the problem of a
      precise selection of amino acid during protein synthesis [Maslow,
      Gariaev 1994]. This requires that some general informational
      intermediator function with a very small capacity, within the
      process of convolution versus development of sign regulative
      patterns of the genome-biocomputer endogenous physical fields. It
      lead to the conceptualization of the genome's
      associative-holographic memory and its quantum nonlocality. These
      assumptions produce a chromosome apparatus and fast wave genetic
      information channels connecting the chromosomes of the separate
      cells of an organism into a holistic continuum, working as the
      biocomputer, where one of the field types produced by the
      chromosomes, are their radiations. This postulated capability of
      such "laser radiations" from chromosomes and DNA, as will be
      shown, has already been demonstrated experimentally in Moscow, by
      the Gariaev Group. Thus it seems the accepted notions about the
      genetic code must change fundamentally, and in doing so it will be
      not only be possible to create and understand DNA as a wave
      biocomputer, but to gain from nature a more fundamental
      understanding of what information [Marcer in press] really is! For
      the Gariaev Group's experiments in Moscow and Toronto say that the
      current understanding of genomic information i.e. the genetic
      code, is only half the story [Marcer this volume]. </blockquote>
    <blockquote style="text-align: left;"><b>1.2 What experiment
        confirms, part one. </b> </blockquote>
    <blockquote style="text-align: justify;"><span lang="ru-RU">These
        wave approaches all require that the fundamental property of the
        chromosome apparatus is the nonlocality of the genetic
        information. In particular, quantum nonlocality/teleportation
        within the framework of concepts introduced by Einstein,
        Podolsky and Rosen (EPR) [Sudbery 1997; Bouwmeester et al.1997].
        This quantum nonlocality has now, by the experimental work of
        the&nbsp;Gariaev Group, been directly related (i) to laser
        radiations from chromosomes, (ii) to the ability of the
        chromosome to gyrate the polarization plane of its own radiated
        and occluded photons and (iii) to the suspected ability of
        chromosomes, to transform their own genetic-sign laser
        radiations into broadband genetic-sign radio waves. In the
        latter case, the polarizations of chromosome laser photons are
        connected nonlocally and coherently to polarizations of radio
        waves. Partially, this was proved during experiments <i>in
          vitro</i>, when the DNA preparations interplaying with a laser
        beam (=632.8nm </span>), organized in a certain way, polarize
      and convert the beam simultaneously into a radio-frequency range.
      In these experiments, another extremely relevant phenomenon was
      detected: photons, modulated within their polarization by
      molecules of the DNA preparation. These are found to be localized
      (or "recorded") in the form of a system of laser mirrors'
      heterogeneities. Further, this signal can "be read out" without
      any essential loss of the information (as theory predicts [
      Gariaev 1994; Marcer, Schempp 1996]), in the form of isomorphously
      (in relation to photons) polarized radio waves. Both the
      theoretical and experimental research on the convoluted condition
      of localized photons therefore testifies in favour of these
      propositions.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>These independently research approaches also lead to the
      postulate, that the liquid crystal phases of the chromosome
      apparatus (the laser mirror analogues) can be considered as a
      fractal environment to store the localized photons, so as to
      create a coherent continuum of quantum-nonlocally distributed
      polarized radio wave genomic information. To a certain extent,
      this corresponds with the idea of the genome's
      quantum-nonlocality, postulated earlier, or to be precise, with a
      variation of it. </blockquote>
    <blockquote style="text-align: justify;"><span lang="ru-RU">This
        variation says that the genetic wave information from DNA,
        recorded within the polarizations of connected photons, being
        quantum-nonlocal, constitutes a broadband radio wave spectrum
        correlated - by means of polarizations - with the photons. Here,
        the main information channel, at least in regard to DNA, is the
        parameter of polarization, which is nonlocal and is the same for
        both photons and the radio waves. A characteristic feature is,
        that the Fourier-image of the radio spectra is dynamic,
        depending essentially on the type of matter interrogated. It can
        therefore be asserted, that this phenomenon concerns a new type
        of a computer (and biocomputer) memory, and also a new type of
        EPR spectroscopy,namely one featuring photon-laser-radiowave
        polarization spectroscopy.<b>The fundamental notion is, that the
          photon-laser-radiowave features of different objects (i.e. the
          Fourier-spectra of the radiowaves of crystals, water, metals,
          DNA, etc) are stored for definite but varying times by means
          of laser mirrors, such that the "mirror spectra" concern
          chaotic attractors with a complex dynamic fractal dynamics,
          recurring in time.</b></span> <span lang="ru-RU">The Gariaev
        Group experiments are therefore not only unique in themselves,
        they are a first example, that a novel static storage/recording
        environment (laser mirrors) exists, capable of directly
        recording the space-time atomic/molecular rotary dynamical
        behaviour </span>of objects. Further the phenomena, detected by
      these experiments described in part two, establish the existence
      of an essentially new type of radio signal, where the information
      is encoded by polarizations of electromagnetic vectors. This will
      be the basis of a new type of video recording, and will create a
      new form of cinema as well. </blockquote>
    <blockquote style="text-align: justify;"><span lang="ru-RU">Further
        experimental research has revealed the high biological (genetic)

        be able to cause a statistically authentic "resuscitation" of
        dead seeds of the plant <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>, which were

        radio waves, which do not carry information from the DNA, is</span>
      <span lang="ru-RU">observed to be biologically inactive. In this
        sequence of experiments, additional evidence was also obtained
        in favour</span> <span lang="ru-RU">of the possibility of the
        existence of the genetic information in form of the polarization
        of a</span> <span lang="ru-RU">radio wave physical field. This
        supports the supposition that the main information channel in
        these experiments is the biosign modulations of polarizations
        mediated by some version of quantum nonlocality. A well known
        fact can therefore be seen in new light, namely, that the
        information biomacromolecules - DNA, RNA and proteins - have an
        outspoken capacity to optical rotatory dispersion of visible
        light and of circular dichroism. Similarly, the low molecular
        components of biosystems, such as saccharides, nucleotides,
        amino acids, porphyrins and other biosubstances</span> <span
        lang="ru-RU">have the same capacity; a capacity, which until now
        made little biological sense. Now, however, it supports, the
        contention that this newly detected phenomenon of quantized
        optical activity can be considered as the means by which the
        organism obtains unlimited information on its own metabolism.
        That is, such information is read by endogenous</span> <span
        lang="ru-RU">laser radiations of chromosomes, which, in their
        turn, produce the regulative ("semantic") radio emission of the
        genome biocomputer. Furthermore, the apparent inconsistency
        between the wavelengths of such radiations and the sizes of
        organisms, cells and subcell structures is abrogated, since the
        semantic resonances in the biosystems' space are realized not at
        the wavelength level, but at the level of frequencies and angles
        of twist of the polarization modes. This mechanism is the basis

      fields. These carry the gene-wave information out beyond the
      limits of the chromosome structure. Thus, at this and subsequent

      nature, as may also be true for the holographic memory of the
      cerebral cortex [ Pribram 1991; Schempp 1992; 1993; Marcer,

        nature; not only because it is realized at a quantum level, but
        also because it works both throughout the space of a biosystem

      constituent basis of that technology, in the history of analogue
      &gt; to &gt; digital &gt; to &gt; now, the figurative semantic
      (nonlocal) wave computer or biocomputer. This biocomputer will be

      on a continuum of genetic molecules (DNA, RNA, proteins, etc).

      essentially different from today's generally accepted but

Features










          of the Wave Model </span></strong> </blockquote>
    <blockquote style="text-align: justify;" lang="ru-RU"><font size="3">Adleman
[1994],










        for example, has used the mechanism for fast and precise mutual
        recognition between the DNA anti-parallels half-chains to solve
        the "the travelling salesman's problem". However in the wave
        model of biosystems, this is only one aspect of the
        self-organization taking place. For here, as the experimental
        evidence now confirms, the mutual recognition of one DNA anti
        parallel half chain (+) by the other (-) concerns special super
        persistent/resonant acoustic-electromagnetic waves or solitons.
        Such DNA solitons have two connected types of memory. The first
        is typical of the phenomenon discovered by Fermi-Pasta-Ulam
        (FPU) [Fermi, 1972]. It concerns the capability of non-linear
        systems to remember initial modes of energisation and to
        periodically repeat them [Dubois 1992]. The DNA liquid crystals
        within the chromosome structure form such a non-linear system.
        The second is that of the DNA-continuum in an organism. Such
        memory is an aspect of the genome's nonlocality. It is
        quasi-holographic/fractal, and relates, as is the case for any
        hologram or fractal, to the fundamental property of biosystems
        i.e. to their ability to restore the whole out of a part. This
        property is well known (grafting of plants, regeneration of a
        lizard's tail, regeneration of a whole organism from the
        oocyte). And a higher form of such a biological memory would be
        a holographic (associative) memory of the brain cortex, i.e. of
        its neural network [Pribram 1991; Schempp 1992; Marcer Schempp
        1997, 1998; Sutherland 1999]. Such wave sign encoding/decoding
        therefore, like DNA's ability to resolve "the traveling
        salesman's problem", is, it can be hypothesized, an integral
        part of DNA's computational biofunctionality. Indeed DNA
        solitary waves (solitons), and in particular, the nucleotide
        waves of oscillatory rotation, "read" the genome's sign
        patterns, so that such sign vibratory dynamics may be considered
        as one of many genomic non-linear dynamic semiotic processes.
        The expression "DNA's texts";, borrowed earlier as a metaphor
        from the linguists, is it turns out therefore related directly
        to actual human speech. For as mathematical-linguistic research
        into DNA and human speech textual patterns, shows [Maslow,
        Gariaev 1994] the key parameter of both such patterns is
        fractality. It can therefore be hypothesized that the grammar of
        genetic texts is a special case of the general grammar of all
        human languages. </font> </blockquote>
    <blockquote style="text-align: justify;" lang="ru-RU"><font size="3">Returning
however










        to DNA computation based on matter-wave sign functions with a
        view to realizing its wave coding capabilities, as distinct
        those used by Adleman, which might be termed its matter
        capabilities. Such true wave control capabilities of the DNA or
        chromosomes are, we hypothesize, those conditions that apply
        inside the living cell, i.e. in an aqueous solution but which
        correspond to a liquid-crystal condition as well. For under such
        conditions, in the unique circumstances of cell division, the
        living cell has the ability to replicate itself, and has the
        property of what in relation to a self replicating automaton,
        von Neumann [1966] called "universal computer construction" so
        that we may say that the living cell is such a computer based on
        DNA [Marcer Schempp 1997a]. And while the artificial cloning of
        a single cell is not yet feasible, what we have been able to do,
        is to record the DNA-wave information appropriate to these wave
        sign conditions of the DNA in a cell on laser mirrors, and to
        use, for example, the recorded DNA-wave information from living
        seeds in the form of radio waves to resuscitate the
        corresponding "dead" seeds damaged by radioactivity. </font> </blockquote>

next










        step forward is therefore to bring into general use, such wave
        information and memory as now newly identified in relation to

        of, for example, </font> </blockquote>

        and speed, such memory could exceed many times over the now
        available magnetic and optical disks, as well as current
        classical holographic systems. But in particular, such
        applications may employ the principles of quantum nonlocality.
        For DNA and the genome have now been identified as active
        "laser-like" environments, where, as experimentally shown,
        chromosome preparations may act as a memory and as "lasers",
        with the abilities i), ii) and iii) above. And finally there are
        the quasi-speech features of the DNA, as these concern both
        natural gene texts, and artificial (synthesized) sign sequences
        of polynucleotides, which emulate natural quasi-speech gene
        programs. However, we believe this maybe a rather dangerous
        path, where a regulatory system of prohibitions on artificial
        wave genes is indispensable. The reason is that such an approach
        to DNA-wave biocomputation means entering new semiotic areas of
        the human genome and the biosphere in general; areas, which are
        used by the Nature to create humankind. This thought follows
        from the theoretical studies on a collective symmetry of the
        genetic code as carried out by the Eigen's laboratory [Scherbak,
        1988] at the Max Planck Institute in Germany. This research
        shows, that the key part of the information, already recorded
        and still being recorded as quasi-speech in the chromosomes of
        all organisms on our planet, may concern semantic exobiological
        influences, since in regard to DNA-wave biocomputation, DNA acts
        as a kind of aerial open to the reception of not only the
        internal influences and changes within the organism but to those
        outside it as well. Indeed we regard this as one of our primary
        findings, which in view of quantum nonlocality of organisms
        extends not only to the organism's local environment, but also
        beyond it to the extent of the entire universe. </font> </blockquote>

        question, if this is the case, is what could such action

        the reading of the genetic texts encoded in the DNA, where
        however this language metaphor is now applied directly to these
        texts. That is to say, rather than the usual analogy taking such
        texts as a digital computer language or symbolic instruction
        code, such texts are considered instead as having the semantic
        and generative grammatical features of a spoken or written
        context dependent human language. That is, we conceived of the
        DNA acting in the same way as the human would, when presented

        for this choice concerned the problem in DNA coding raised by
        the question of synonymy and homonymy as it applies to the third

        below, synonymy even seems to provide a kind of redundancy,
        homonymy constitutes a serious difficulty under the often
        proposed postulate that only the first two elements of the DNA
        codon triplet (standing for a particular protein- the picture in
        the mind's eye, so to speak) are the significant ones. That is
        to say, how does the reading ribosome know which protein has to
        be generated, if the third nucleotide in codon's triplet does
        not of itself provide the answer with total certainty? The
        proposed answer was, that this ambiguity might be resolved by

        interrelated assembly of sub wave structures, which keep the
        whole solitonic process in a stationary state over a

        differentiation referred to above follows from the fact that,
        while in quantum mechanics, a wave function is only determined
        up to an arbitrary phase, phase difference is of physical
        significance (as in holography), because there exists a class of
        quantum observables, which are the gauge invariant geometric
        phases of the state vector or wave function [Resta 1997; Schempp
        1992; Anandan 1992]. These observables must therefore be
        distinguished from those which are the eigenvalues of some
        operator, usually the Hamiltonian or energy function. Such a
        state vector description (with gauge invariant phases) by means
        of which each DNA molecule can clearly be expected to be
        described, would explain the difference between the nature of
        quantum interference and quantum self interference, which DNA
        from its double helical structure can thus be recognized to
        concern. </font> </blockquote>

        above means of representing DNA therefore, | &gt;&lt; |
        represents by the quantum correspondence principle, the quantum
        soliton control [see also, Denschlag et al, 2000] or wavepacket
        activity rather than its classical soliton counterpart, which
        was the subject of the Moscow computer simulations. These all
        confirm the Gariaev group's conclusions reached as a result of
        their experiments, that DNA functions as a quantum coherent
        system/assembly (of now quantum oscillators) or whole, by means
        of quantum entanglement. A whole, where as (1) shows, this may
        be decomposed into an orthogonal family of holographically
        encoded 3 spatial dimensional images in line with the usual
        description of a quantum mechanical diagonalization. It also
        says in line with the Gariaev group's findings that DNA can be
        described as an "autocorrelation", where as shown here, this is
        an optimally efficient decomposition into a decorrelated family
        of holographic code primitives /holograms, and that this, as
        Schempp[1992] shows, follows from the fact a quantum mechanical
        harmonic oscillator (in this case the highly complex DNA
        molecule itself) is equivalent to an assembly of bosons each
        having one polarization state. The latter substantiates the
        Gariaev group conclusion that they have indeed discovered an
        entirely new form of electromagnetic vector by means of which
        holographic images are carried in the form of a polarization
        state, suitable for a new form of cinema, video and computer. </font>

        </i>says that DNA satisfies the principle of computer
        construction [Von Neumann, 1966], since it carries a copy of
        itself, and is </font> </blockquote>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><font size="3">(a) its own blueprint
        written in the genetic texts, where the mechanism engineering
        the DNA replication is the biophotonic electromagnetic field,
        while the "letters" of the genetic texts A, G, C, U are held
        invariant, but where,</font><br>
      <br>
      <font size="3">(b) in the case of the replication of the organism,
        for which DNA is the blueprint written in the holographic
        information, the reverse is the case. That is, it is the
        "acoustic field" in this case, which mechanically
        constructs/engineers the organism out of the available matter,
        in accordance with the information held in the electromagnetic
        field holograms (these being held invariant in this case). This
        must therefore mean that Adenine, Uracil, Guanine, and Cytosine
        are invariants structures/weightings in both the acoustic and
        electromagnetic field domains. These mechanisms therefore
        correspond with the know basic features of quantum
        communication/information transfer known as quantum
        teleportation, which consists of two inseparable signal
        processes one classical, one quantum. The latter is
        instantaneous transmission from X to Y (unlimited in principle
        as to distance), but which cannot be used without the other,
        which is transmission from X to Y by conventional means at the
        speed of light or lower. In the case of DNA, therefore, it is
        the existence of the genetic text of the organism itself which
        constitutes the classical signal process of quantum
        teleportation, able to facilitate the quantum mechanical signal
        processes of both the copying of the DNA as its own blueprint,
        and of the construction of the organism (for which DNA is the
        blueprint) in a massively parallel way by the means of quantum
        teleportation.]</font><br>
      <br>
      <font size="3">Remarkably too, <i>quantum holography</i> also
        confirms and is confirmed by another astonishing experimental
        finding. This is the so-called "DNA-Phantom-Effect" [Gariaev,
        Junin, 1989; Gariaev et al, 1991; Gariaev, 1994], a very
        intriguing phenomenon, widely discussed, when it was first found
        by Peter Gariaev. Later similar phenomenon termed 'mimicking the
        effect of dust' [Allison et al, 1990]. was detected by group of
        R.Pecora. This is the discovery that the pattern below, found in
        the first experiment described, when a laser illuminated DNA,
        does not immediately disappear if the DNA samples are removed
        from the apparatus. It continues in different form for sometime.
        An explanation would be that <i>quantum holography </i>defines
        an admitter/absorber quantum vacuum model of quantum mechanics
        in terms of annihilation/creation operators [Schempp 1993],
        implying that DNA does indeed behave like a single quantum,
        which induces a "hole" temporarily in the vacuum by its removal.

        size="3"> The basic assumptions of our work include the
        following: 1. the genome has a capacity for quasi-consciousness
        so that DNA “words” produce and help in the recognition of
        “semantically meaningful phrases”; 2. the DNA of chromosomes
        control fundamental programs of life in a dual way: as chemical
        matrixes and as a source of wave function and holographic
        memory; 3. processes in the substance-wave structures of the
        genome can be observed and registered through the dispersion and
        absorption of a bipolar laser beam. The present article brings
        forward considerable theoretical and experimental evidence in
        support of this model, and discusses its practical applications
        with respect to cancer and HIV therapeutic strategies.<br>

        <p><font size="3">The challenge of<i> </i>HIV and cancer and
            the essence of Life both lie on the same plane. As of now,
            we still don't understand the most crucial facts about Life:
            how did it appear on earth and in which way it is coded in
            chromosomes? Several hypotheses are available, and each of
            them at best represents just a piece of reality. This is
            where the theoretical and biological difficulties in
            interpreting the HIV and cancer phenomena come from<i> - </i>and










            the price we are paying for this misunderstanding are the
            mistakes emerging in the treatment of these diseases. Both
            pathologies affect the most vital part in any biological
            system, namely, its genetic apparatus - the organism’s
            “self-knowledge”. And this is the paradox: we seem to know
            quite enough about chromosomes and DNA - oncogenes have
            already been found, the HIV genome has been studied, and
            it’s clear how these informational structures function in
            chromosomes. The genetic code and ribosome operation
            principles also seem to have been investigated in detail.
            But for some reason all this information is not enough to
            develop universal methods for a successful intervention
            against cancer and HIV.</font></p>
      </font><font size="3">A half-lie is the worst lie, because people
        have reason to believe it - and this is especially true with
        respect to the genetic coding paradigm. In this field,
        everything is an impregnable bastion for critics, and everything
        is ruled by dogma. Even the key definition, the strategic scheme
        of genetic coding (DNA-&gt; RNA-&gt; protein), is called “the
        Central Dogma”. Until recently, all attacks on this dogma seemed
        trivial and doomed to failure. That was an incorrect assumption,
        as it turned out. The accuracy and effectiveness of research
        strategies dealing with HIV, cancer and many other pathologies
        depend on whether we orderly understand the genetic coding
        mechanism. The discovery of reverse transcriptase was the first
        spectacular breach in this dogma, which as a result was
        re-assigned a more discreet, working-hypothesis status: DNA Û
        RNA--&gt; protein. However, our ideas on protein biosynthesis
        are gradually eroding: each new model is just an approach to the
        truth, to the understanding of the genome language-image
        pluralism as coding tool for the spatiotemporal structure of
        biosystems [32, 33].</font><font face="Times New Roman"> </font><b><font

          <p><font size="3">II. What do we want to prove?</font></p>
        </font> </b></div>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><font size="3">In this paper we intend
        to propose ideas which are not aimed at the final destruction of
        the so-called genetic code “canonical” triplet model, but at the
        development and establishment of its exact position in the
        knowledge basis of the chromosome operational principles. Yes,
        it’s possible to state that the triplet code is the truth.
        However, this truth is as correct as the statement that we could
        write a word using an alphabet. That statement is certainly
        right. But if we try, based only on this knowledge, to go
        further and vouch that by means of this alphabet we can compile
        grammatically-correct sentences, this new statement won’t be
        accurate. Such a statement is incorrect, in fact, because for
        the compilation of human speech laws of syntax, logic and
        grammar have to be applied. As for the genome, it’s a very
        speech-like and logical structure, but its fundamental features
        are not the only way to express genome associative-semantic
        structures. Furthermore, we are inclined to agree with
        V.V.Nalimov’s ideas [43] leading us to the conclusion that a
        genome possesses quasi-conscious abilities. The logic we use and
        the models we developed are only an attempt to obtain
        higher-level understanding of laws pertaining to genetic text
        structuring or to other genome vital structures - knowledge
        which is now just beginning to emerge. The Russian researchers
        A.G.Gurwitch [38], V.N.Beklemishev [29] and A.A.Lyubitchev [41]
        laid the foundation of this science in the late 1920s.</font></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><font size="3">What type of approaches
        might enrich<i> </i>the common<i>ly</i>-accepted genetic coding
        theory and how can these innovations assist in resolving the HIV
        and cancer issues, in particular? Let’s assume, until getting a
        final proof, three "axioms" which have already gotten<i> </i>definite










        theoretical and experimental confirmation [8, 32, 33, 37]:</font></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><font size="3">DNA molecules, included
        in chromosomes, possess a substance--wave duality which is
        similar to the dualism of elementary particles. In accordance
        with it, DNA codes an organism in two ways, both with the
        assistance of DNA matter and by DNA sign wave functions,
        including coding at its own laser radiation level - [28].</font></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><font size="3">The genetic apparatus
        can be non-local at the molecular level (holographic memory of a
        chromosome continuum) and at the same time quantum mechanically
        non-local in compliance with the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen effect
        [4]. The latter means that the genome genetic and other
        regulatory wave information is recorded at the polarization
        level of its photons and is non-locally (everywhere and in no
        time) transferred (plays out) throughout the entire space of a
        biosystem by the<b> </b>polarization code parameter. This helps
        to set a quick-response information contact among the billions
        of cells constituting an organism.</font></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><font size="3">The genome on the whole
        and the individual nucleus of cells can generate and recognize
        text-associative regulatory structures with the application of a
        background principle, holography and quantum non-locality.</font><b><font

    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><font size="3">Let’s assume that final
        proofs of the above-mentioned statements have been obtained.
        Then the problem of HIV and cancer rises to an altogether
        different intellectual dimension.</font></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><font size="3">For instance, what does
        the “DNA matter-wave dualism” mean - and in which way is it
        linked with the chromosome's numerous code functions? (Note: by
        code function we understand processes which are dramatically
        differed from the known triplet genetic code) In some sense, the
        genome operates like a complex multiwave laser with adjustable
        frequencies. It emits DNA light which is gene- and
        sign-modulated by amplitude, phase, frequency and polarization.
        Moreover, the genome is also likely to be a radio wave emitter
        converting a wide spectrum of coherent sign-polarized radio
        bands [37] <i>(P.P. Gariaev, G.G.Tertyshniy, Ye.A. Leonova,
          etc. Radio wave spectroscopy of local photons: exit to quantum
          non-local bioinformational processes. Sensors and Systems
          (2000, N9, pp. 2-13). </i>The genome is also a dynamical
        multiple hologram which is able to produce light and radio wave
        images [37] which carry out management functions by the
        biosystem. These structures are also the carriers of
        electromagnetic marking schemes (calibration fields) of
        biosystems’ space and time organization. And finally, the genome
        is a quasi-text form possessing elements of quantum
        non-locality, which can without any time delay “read” itself in
        billions of cells and use information, thereby received, as a
        control blueprint for living functions and structural
        organization [8, 37]. Many biologists and geneticists, let alone
        doctors, are likely to consider these new concepts of genome
        organization as extremely complicated. However, not all of them
        will: these ideas, whose seeds were first planted in Russia in
        the 1920s, have seen a dramatic and accelerating development
        over the last decade.</font></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><font size="3">This clearly suggests
        that it’s necessary to modify our strategy in searching for HIV
        and cancer cures, as the traditional approaches to solving this
        issue increasingly resemble the wish to produce a good harvest,
        having planted an asphalt road. The new strategy has to be based
        on fundamental investigations of substance-wave duality and
        quasi-speech attributes of a higher system genome. Let’s stress
        once again that we consider a chromosome continuum as a sign
        laser &amp; radio wave emitter [8, 33, 37], and direct
        experimental evidences allows us to think so. For instance, to
        demonstrate laser abilities of genetic structures, we showed
        that DNA and chromatin in vitro could be pumped as a
        laser-active medium for a consequent laser light generation
        [28].</font></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><font size="3">If we accept these
        vital characteristics of a genome, then new specific issues
        arise: for example, does the sign character of chromosome laser
        &amp; radio wave radiation change when a xenobiotic HIV genome
        inserts itself into it? And, at the same time, what happens to
        the radiation “semantics” during a transposition of oncogenes or
        any other mobile polynucleotide sequences as well as during
        B&lt;--&gt; Z and other conformational transitions of DNA
        in-vivo? Are these changes linked to an alteration of quasi- and
        real holographic programs, i.e. are new programs created and old
        ones changed, or are these programs erased, and so on? Does the
        radiation polarization parameter retain, in semiotic sense, its
        dynamic properties in the process of genome reorganization? Do
        all these changes influence ribosome operation? Further
        questions may arise. The answer to any of them can play a key
        role in interpreting the nature of HIV and cancer.</font></p>

        <p><font size="3">IV. Theoretical structures - more details</font></p>
      </b></div>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><font size="3">Let’s take another
        fundamental problem. Oncogene and HIV genomes, occupying certain
        positions in a 3D space of master cell chromosomes, do not
        express themselves as pathogenic factors until a certain time.
        In this sense, the behavior of HIV in the infected patient’s
        organism is unpredictable. HIV's latency period may vary from a
        week to 10 years. A specific mechanism of HIV-infection
        induction from the latent (sleeping) condition is thought to
        exist, but this mechanism is still misunderstood and, therefore,
        the opportunity to make HIV viruses permanently latent in the
        human organism is being missed. In this condition, the organism
        and the cells simply “don’t notice” them or even, as in the case
        of oncogenes, use them for their own benefit as a reproduction
        factor. Why does an organism adequately accept and contain them
        until a certain time X, and why they are semantically reborn,
        causing a management catastrophe in cell, after the X-time has
        come? Following our logic, it’s possible to think that both in
        the pathologic and normal state four factors are engaged, at
        least: genome “holography” and “linguistics”, genome background
        (context) self-organization, and its quantum non-locality.</font></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><font size="3">In the course of
        evolution, biosystems have produced their own genetic “texts”
        and a biocomputing genome as a quasi- intelligent “subject”
        which “reads and understands” these texts at its level. The fact
        that natural human texts (it doesn’t matter what the language
        is) and genetic “texts” have similar mathematical &amp;
        linguistic and entropy-statistical characteristics is extremely
        important for the genome elementary “intelligence”. This
        relates, in particular, to concepts such as the fractality of
        letters' occurrence frequency density distribution (in genetic
        “texts”, nucleotides execute function of letters) [21].</font></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><font size="3">American researchers
        obtained another confirmation of the genome coding function
        linguistic interpretation [20]. Dealing with the “coding” and
        “non-coding” eukaryote DNA sequences [(in the framework of old
        concepts of a gene), they came to a conclusion which was similar
        with ours and which conflicted with the central dogma that
        meaningful functions are concentrated only in the protein-coding
        DNA sections. The researchers applied a statistical analysis
        method for studying natural and musical texts, known as
        Zipf-Mandelbrot’s law, as well as the known Shannon postulate of
        text information redundancy calculated as a text entropy (more
        information about text entropy and statistics of words
        distribution in texts is given in [1, 25, 27, 31]). As a result,
        they found that DNA “non-coding” areas (space, intronic and
        others) had more in common with natural languages than the
        “coding” ones. Taking this for granted, the authors inferred
        that “non-coding” sequences of genetic molecules were the basis
        for one or more biological languages. Furthermore, the authors
        developed a statistical algorithm for searching DNA coding
        sequences; the algorithm they developed demonstrated that
        protein-coding areas had significantly fewer long-distance
        correlations, compared with areas separating these sequences.
        The DNA-sequence distribution was so sophisticated that the
        methods the researchers applied stopped working satisfactorily
        at distances of over 10^3-10^2 base pairs. Zipf-Mandelbrot’s
        distribution for “words” occurrence frequency, where the number
        of nucleotides ranged from 3 to 8, demonstrated that natural
        language had more in common with the non-coding sequences, than
        with the coding ones. It’s worth noting that the authors
        considered the coding only as a record of amino acid sequence
        information. And that was a paradox which made them state that
        DNA non-coding areas were not merely “junk”, but the lingual
        structures designed for reaching some still unknown goals.
        Despite the discovery of hidden complexity in these non-coding
        areas, the authors didn’t understand the implications of the
        long-distance correlations characterizing these structures.
        (They illustrated the process based on a family of genomes of
        the myosin heavy chain and assigned it to the evolutionary
        transition from lower taxons to higher taxons). The data
        presented in [20] is in full compliance with the ideas we had
        independently put forward [32, 33]; according to our point of
        view, DNA non-coding sequences, or approximately 95-98% of a
        genome, are a strategic informational content of chromosomes.
        The said context has a substance-wave nature and, therefore, is
        multidimensional and functions as a holographic
        associative-image and semantic program of embryological origin,
        the semantic continuation and the logic end of any biosystem.
        Having intuitively understood that the old genetic coding model
        led to a dead-end, the authors [20] said a nostalgic good-bye to
        this now-obsolete paradigm, but didn’t propose anything to
        replace it.</font></p>

        <p><font size="3">V. Homonymous-synonymous ambiguities of
            genetic texts. What does an organism need them for?</font></p>
      </font><b style="font-weight: bold;"> </b></div>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><font size="3">Text homonymy and
        synonymy are the common fundamental semantic properties of
        natural and genetic texts. These features provide chromosomes,
        natural texts and speech with redundant and multivalent
        information and, thus, ensure some adaptive flexibility.
        Ambivalent genetic texts acquire their monosemantic meaning
        owing to a variation of DNA sequence position in genome space
        through their transpositions and/or a transposition of their
        environment. This resembles the situation with natural texts and
        speech, in which homonymous-synonymous ambiguities of a semantic
        field are eliminated by the context (this background principle
        is described in [44]). Homonymies of coding doublets are easily
        found in the traditional genetic code triplet model. The meaning
        of these homonymies is still misunderstood and isn’t taken into
        account, with some exceptions [33, 35]. The perplexing issue of
        mRNA codon homonymies emerged with the creation of the triplet
        model of amino acid coding in the process of protein
        biosynthesis. It immediately became a “time-bomb”, since the
        correct explanation of a biological (informational) meaning of
        these homonymies automatically leads to the necessity of
        significant correction or complete revision of the triplet
        model. How are codons homonymies produced? A set of different
        amino acids is coded in mRNA codons by similar doublets; the
        third nucleotides in codons can relocate chaotically: they are
        wobbling and may become any of the four canonical ones. As a
        result, they don’t correlate with the coding amino acids [3,
        11]. That’s why semantic ambiguity appears regarding the
        ribosome’s choice of amino acid-carrying-tRNA anti-codons. For
        instance, each synonymous codon of the standard code of higher
        biosystems (AGT and AGC) codes for serine, while each synonymous
        AGA and AGG codon codes for arginine. Thus, the third
        nucleotides of mRNA codons in combination with a sign doublet
        don’t have exact amino acid correlates; at the same time, the
        first two sign codon nucleotides are similar with one another,
        yet code different amino acids - hence the ambiguity in
        selecting tRNA anti-codons. In other words, a ribosome may take
        serine or arginine tRNA with an equal probability ; such an
        outcome can initiate synthesis of abnormal proteins. In fact,
        these mistake don’t occur and the precision of the protein
        synthesis process is extremely high. These mistakes appear only
        in some metabolically abnormal situations (the presence of some
        antibiotics, a lack of amino acids, etc.). Usually a ribosome
        somehow correctly chooses the tRNA anti-codons out of the
        homonymous doublets.</font></p>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><font size="2">
        <p><font size="3">We think that the correct choice out of
            doublet anti-codon-homonyms is realized through a
            resonant-wave or context (associative, holographic) and/or
            “background” mechanisms. Amino acid code homonymity can be
            overcome in the same way as they are in natural languages -
            by the placement of a homonym in a complete phrase; the
            homonym decodes the context and attaches a unique meaning to
            it, thus resolving the ambiguity. That’s why mRNA, acting as
            a “phrase”, should operate in the protein synthesis process
            as an integral coding system, non-locally determining the
            sequence of amino acids at the level of tRNA aminoacylated
            associates, which interact in a global and complementary way
            with the entire mRNA molecule. Macrosteric disagreement
            between mRNA and tRNA continuums could be eliminated due to
            a conformational lability of macromolecules. The A-P
            sections of a ribosome are responsible for accepting these
            associated amino acids, with their consequent enzymatic
            sewing into peptide chains. In this case, a context-oriented
            unambiguous choice and elimination of the doublet-anticodon
            homonymy will occur. Considering the above, it’s possible to
            predict that the interaction of aminoacylated tRNAs with
            mRNAs has a collective phase character and is effected by a
            type of re-association (“annealing”) of one-string DNA upon
            the temperature reduction after melting of a native
            polynucleotide. Does any experimental evidence for this
            contention exist? Yes. A great deal of such information is
            available and collected in the analytical review [45]. Here
            we will only present some of the data. For example, the
            correctness of terminating codons recognition by tRNA
            molecules is known to depend on their context (that’s a
            confirmation of our theoretical model), in particular, on
            the existence of a uridine after the stop codon. In Paper
            [9] the following information is presented: the insertion of
            a line consisting of nine rarely-used CUA-leucine codons in
            the position after the 13th one (in the compound of 313
            codons of the tested mRNA) resulted in active inhibition of
            their translation, yet did not notably influence the
            translation of other CUA-codon-containing mRNAs. Here, the
            translation context effect is clearly seen as a strategic
            influence of distant mRNA codons on the inclusion (or
            non-inclusion) of certain amino acids in the composition of
            a protein being synthesized. This is a remote influence,
            connected with the protein synthesis continuum; it’s also an
            example of the genetic apparatus’ non-local functions,
            whereby the protein-synthesizing apparatus recognizes mRNA
            not only in parts (by nucleotides, locally), but in one
            piece (non-locally) as well. However, in the work being
            cited this key phenomenon is only stated and remains
            inexplicable to the researchers; and probably for this
            reason they don’t even discuss it. Similar results continue
            to appear in the literature at an increasing rate. In the
            work under discussion the authors refer to half a dozen
            analogous situations, whose explanation in the classical
            interpretation is rather difficult. This obviously points to
            inconsistencies in the genetic code triplet model. The model
            also fails to explain the existence of unusually swollen
            anticodons. When they are involved in protein synthesis, the
            number of base pairs in the ribosome A-site exceeds 3 [45].
            This finding challenges the dogmatic postulate of code
            triplets . Furthermore, studies of tRNA-tRNA interactions on
            ribosomes are presented in [45]; they offer full
            confirmation of our model, in which we consider an
            amino-acid-loaded tRNA complex as the predecessor of a
            protein. In [45] an important idea, very close to ours, was
            put forward: the influence of the mRNA context on
            monosemantic incorporation of amino acids into a peptide
            chain reflects some basic, still unstudied, laws of genetic
            information coding in the protein synthesis process. It’s
            worth remembering that genetic information about protein
            synthesis occupies only some 1% of a chromosome's total
            volume. The remaining 98.5% of the whole contain programs of
            a significantly higher level.</font></p>

      </font><b style="font-weight: bold;"> </b></div>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><font size="3">As we can see, the
        previously-existing hypotheses regarding the genetic code and
        the operation of the protein-synthesis apparatus have been
        grossly simplified. The prion phenomenon is likely to be the
        last argument in favor of a final revision of the molecular
        biology central dogma.</font></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><font size="3">Prions are low-weight
        molecular parasitic proteins (PrPsc) targeting the brains of
        animals (mad-cow disease) and human beings (Alzheimer’s,
        Kreutzfeld-Jacob’s syndrome, etc.). Virus-like
        strain-specificity is an inexplicable feature of prions. This
        strain-specificity is only attributed to microorganisms or
        viruses which have a genetic apparatus. And yet, it’s thought
        that prions don’t have a genome, since all efforts to find
        traces of DNA or RNA in them have failed. An acute
        contradiction, which once again discredits the molecular biology
        central dogma, arises: prions don’t have a genome, but genetic
        signs are present. Some scientists, unable to explain this
        phenomenon and trying to “save” the central dogma, nevertheless
        suppose that DNA or RNA traces are hidden in the prion
        molecule’s wrinkles [10]. However, investigations carried out in
        this field over decades and endorsed by the Nobel prize awarded
        to Stanley Prusiner in 1997, reliably demonstrated that prions
        had neither nucleic acids nor a genome [23]. How are we to
        resolve this contradiction? If we admit that the central dogma
        is correct, then this is impossible. Having rejected this dogma,
        we can imagine the following prion biogenesis scenario [34]: in
        this model, a “prion virtual genome”, i.e. a provisional genome
        "borrowed" from the master cells for a given time, is the chief
        player. To put it more exactly, this is a protein-synthesizing
        apparatus of master cells. Prions are likely to have retained
        the paleogenetic way as their way of reproduction; in some cases
        this breeding method enables prions not to use genes encoded in
        chromosomes, but to self-reproduce in another way, ignoring the
        central dogma of molecular biology and genetics. To synthesize
        prions, a cell has to address their genes: it’s a progressive,
        but, at the same time, organizationally and energetically
        difficult method. Prions can simplify this procedure.&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><font size="3"> We believe that PrPsc
        (Prion-Protein-scrapy)&nbsp; NH-group peptide bonds can react
        with the OH-groups of ribose remains of accepting CCA-sequences
        of respective tRNAs. In the course of a hypothetical
        fermentative reaction, an emerging poly-tRNA-complex, the
        collinear PrPsc, pairwisely in space draws together anticodons
        and forms a covalent and discrete “information RNA analog ”
        (iaRNA). This stage is practically a reverse process of the
        protein synthesis on a ribosome. The process is likely to take
        place on the ribosome’s A- and P-sites. Then, the synthesis of
        RNA on iaRNA takes place. For this purpose, a respective RNA
        polymerase, which can work with an iaRNA covalently-discrete
        matrix, is required. That’s the mechanism of “mutual usage” of
        the protein-synthesizing apparatus during the prion reproduction
        period. This impermanence creates the illusion that prions don’t
        possess a genetic apparatus. In this process, prion peptide
        chains are used as matrices on which poly-tRNA-continua in pairs
        arrange themselves on the ribosome’s A-P sections, forming
        discrete polyanticodons. The latter, joining in pairs , either
        become a direct matrix for the prion’s RNA-dependent mRNA
        synthesis, or (in the other case) polyanticodons may be
        specifically spliced and then alloyed in a
        covalently-undisrupted mRNA matrix of prions. Thus, prion’s mRNA
        polymerizes prions on a ribosome. That means that the ribosome
        operates in the reverse direction, being a
        “prion-polyanticodon-dependent mRNA polymerase” in the process.
        And, therefore, violating the dogma, information is transferred
        from a protein to RNA. Thus, the scheme of the
        DNA&gt;RNA&gt;Protein dogma completely changes<b>. </b>In this
        case, it isn’t the dogma any longer, but only a working model
        which needs further clarification and development. In accordance
        with this view on prion biogenesis, the prion stain-specificity
        is explained by peculiarities of reverse operation of ribosomes,
        temporarily recruited during the synthesis of each prion strain.
        These peculiarities reflect a taxonomic position of
        prion-producing biosystems. Now, back to the basic postulates of
        the genetic code model, still widely-accepted: the genetic code
        is a triplet, unoverlapped, degenerated<b> </b>and doesn’t have
        “commas”, i.e. codons are not separated from each other.
        Information flows from DNA through RNA to a protein. And
        finally, the code is universal. In light of the preceding
        arguments, what’s left out of the initial postulates? Nothing,
        essentially. Indeed, the code is likely to be a multi-letter
        fractal and heteromultiplet structure coding both individual
        proteins and functionally-linked protein associates. It has
        overlaps formed due to a shift in the ribosome’s reading frames.
        It has commas, since heterocodons can be isolated from one
        another by sequences with other functions, including punctuation
        functions. The code is not universal: in 14 cases, it is
        differed from the standard code of higher-level biosystems. The
        mitochondrial, yeast,&nbsp; micoplasm, trematodian and other
        lower organisms’ codes are included in these cases [5, 6].&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><font size="3"> And finally: a protein
        can be a matrix for RNA, as we can see from the prion example.
        How should we understand an actual protein code, taking into
        account all the above-mentioned contradictions and in line with
        our theory? It is possible to postulate a qualitative,
        simplified, initial version of substance-wave control over the
        amino acids' line-up order, dictated by the associates of
        aminoacylated tRNA, the predecessors of proteins. Having
        admitted this assumption, it’s easier to understand the
        operation of the protein code and consider it as a
        hierarchically-structured program of the substance-wave
        biosystem organization. In this sense, the code is the first
        stage in a chromosome’s plan of building a biosystem, since the
        genome language is multidimensional and pluralistic and is
        capable of setting up more than just a protein synthesis task.
        The basic statements of this proposed preliminary model of
        matter-wave sign processes in protein biosynthesis are as
        follows:<br>
      </font></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Multicomponent
ribonucleoproteid










        protein-synthesizing apparatus is a system which generates
        highly organized sign radiation of acoustic-electromagnetic
        fields which strategically regulate its self-organization and
        the order of inclusion of amino acids in a polypeptide chain.</font></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><font size="3">Aminoacylated tRNAs are
        assembled in sequences, which are the precursors of protein
        synthesis. This assembling is realized before the contact with
        the A-P ribosome site. The resulting continuum of tRNA
        anticodons pool is complementary to the complete mRNA, excluding
        dislocations determined by the availability of non-canonical
        nucleotide pairs.</font></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><font size="3">The sequence of
        aminoacylated tRNA in associates-protein precursors is
        determined by the sign collective resonance of all the
        participants involved in the amino acid sequence synthesis. In
        this process, pre-mRNA and mRNA, which function as an integral
        continuum (macrocontext) of heteropolycodons variously scaled by
        length (including an intronic fraction pre-mRNA) are the key
        wave matrices. The main function of the wave matrices is an
        associative-context orientation of the aminoacylated tRNA
        sequence; this orientation works on a global scale, compared to
        F.Crick's “wobble-hypothesis”, superseding the rules of
        canonical pairing of nucleotides in the unidimensional space
        mRNA-tRNA. Laser-like radiations, emitted by the participants in
        this process and correcting the order of insertion of the amino
        acid components into a peptide, also function on the ribosome in
        addition to and/or together with the resonance regulations of a
        mutual dislocation of the codon-anticodon continuums. A ribosome
        enzymatically “de jure” fixes the peptide covalent bonds of
        amino acid sequences, selected “de facto” in a
        polyaminoacid-poly-tRNA-associate, the predecessor of the
        protein.</font></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><font size="3">The resonance-wave
        “censorship” of the order of inclusion of amino acids in a
        peptide chain emends the potential semantic disorder in the
        creation of false protein “proposals” following from the
        homonymy of codon families, and ensures their correct “amino
        acid conceptualization” due to the context lift of the homonymy
        of multisided even doublets in codons The same mechanism is
        engaged in a higher-ranked ambiguity when the number of codons
        is (n+1).</font></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><font size="3">Genetic code
        degeneration is necessary for pre-mRNA-mRNA-dependent,
        context-oriented exact matching of aminoacylated tRNAs,
        determined by the nature of wave associative resonance
        interactions in a protein-synthesizing apparatus.</font></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><font size="3">The mechanism of
        generating the correct sequences of aminoacylated tRNAs on the
        wave matrixes of pre-mRNA-mRNA may be considered as a particular
        case of a partially complementary re-association of one-string
        DNA-DNA and RNA-DNA or, in general, as a self-assembly process
        known to characterize ribosomes, chromosomes, membranes and
        other molecular- and super-molecular cellular structures.</font></p>

    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><font size="3">Thus, the role the mRNA
        plays is many-sided and dualistic. This molecule, like DNA, is a
        cornerstone in the evolutionary process and is marked by the
        mutually-dependent, synergistic unity of material and wave
        genetic information. An ambiguity of the material (substantial)
        coding is resolved by the precision of the wave information,
        which is likely to be realized through the mechanisms of
        collective resonance and laser-holographic (associative,
        contextual and background) effects in the cellular-tissue
        continuum. A jump to a more advanced level of wave regulation of
        the RNA--&gt;Protein translation is accompanied by a partial or
        complete departure from the canonical laws of pairing of adenine
        with uracil (thymine) and of guanine with cytosine, which were
        attributable to the early (and simpler) evolutionary stages of
        DNA replication and RNA transcription. Such a refusal is
        informationally necessary, unavoidable and energetically
        preferable at a higher biosystem level. It’s worth stressing
        once again that the context associative-holographic mechanisms
        of operation of an organism’s protein-synthesizing system are
        tightly linked with the so-called “background principle” [44]
        and also with a multivector and multisided logic of a
        sophisticated system management (Gerhard Thomas’ kenogrammer)
        [26]. From this point of view, macrocontexts of
        pre-informational and contexts of informational RNA might be
        considered as a background which in this particular case is an
        “information noise source”. This permits to significantly
        amplify a signal under which the correct choice (wave
        identification) is made of one in two homonymous aminoacylated
        tRNAs, where only one of the two is to be incorporated in a
        protein correct “phrase”.&nbsp; This selection is only possible
        after a ribosome has managed to split a coherent component in
        the form of repeats of the same recognitions of one of the two
        similar doublets in codons. The following simplified example can
        explain the situation. Let’s suppose that it’s necessary to
        select one of two words (analogues of codons with
        doublets-homonyms). The words are “<b>c</b>ow” and “<b>b</b>ow”.
        It’s clear that the choice depends on the entire sentence, or on
        the context which helps to identify a signal, the correct word.
        If the sentence is “A good cow gives lots of milk”, then the
        replacement of “<b>c</b>ow” with the word “<b>b</b>ow” is equal
        to noise generation and to losing the signal. Pre-informational
        RNA and introns are likely to play a similar part; they are
        different levels of contexts which a live cell and its ribosome
        apparatus have to read and conceptualize to take a precise
        decision on tRNA anticodon selection in homonymy situation.</font></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><font size="3">A family of various
        solitons (optical, acoustic, conformational,
        rotational-oscillating, etc.) excited in polynucleotides can
        become an apparatus for continual (non-local) “reading” of
        context RNA sequences on a whole. These solitons help gather
        semantic information on RNA contexts and then associatively
        regulate codon-anticodon sign interrelations.
        Genomes-biocomputers of cells carry out semantic estimates.
        Soliton reading, scanning the RNA surface, is a method of
        polynucleotide continual reading. For instance, the solitons of
        rotating torque vibrations of nucleotides on a sugar-phosphate
        axis we physically and mathematically considered for one-chain
        RNA-like DNA segments [30, 36]. These solitons respond to the
        nucleotide sequence alteration by the modulation of their
        dynamic behavior which acquires sign features and can probably
        be transmitted remotely, or over distances significantly
        exceeding the hydrogen bond length. Without a remote (wave,
        continual) migration of a signal containing information about
        the whole system, i.e. about pre-mRNA-mRNA-sequences, it isn’t
        possible to realize associative-context protein synthesis
        regulation. For this purpose, the wave capability of solitons
        (as well as of holographic memory) to deal both with separate
        parts and integral system as a whole, is required. This
        continuity or non-locality (which is the same) ensures that the
        ribosome apparatus recognizes and correctly chooses an actual
        codon from the two available doublet-homonymous ones, the codon,
        pseudo-noised with a background (context).</font></p>

    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><font size="3">What is the link
        between the above discussion and the problem of HIV and cancer
        research? Obviously, the link is direct. The HIV genome and
        oncogenes as well as other DNA structures, pseudogenes for
        instance, “are silent” (as factors of destruction), and this
        silence continues until a certain time. This key moment for
        initiation of a genome's pathological condition in cells,
        potentially inclined to abnormal development, is determined by
        transpositions of oncogenes and the HIV genome, or by
        transpositions of their polynucleotide surroundings in the
        chromosomal space and time structure. In both cases, the context
        environment of the pathogenic genome changes. The latter is no
        longer homonymous, unrecognizable or acceptable as a normal one
        by the cell. Other signals aimed at HIV reproduction are turned
        on (“are read and conceptualized”). A cell under the new context
        recognizes oncogenes as factors having other (pathological)
        command functions. The changed background (context) identifies
        and amplifies in the new polynucleotide situation potential
        signals and other meanings, which were hidden so far. The
        situation looks like that taking place in protein synthesis
        (choosing a correct codon out of the homonymic codons). Under
        this new context, cells are “confused in giving meanings” of DNA
        sequences and take-in wrong “decisions” as correct; this results
        in the complete shift of metabolism and its re-adjustment to a
        “cancer/viral way” - to reproduce the HIV genome. Here, a
        dualistic situation occurs: the new decisions are wrong in
        relation to the organism, but are right pertaining to the HIV
        reproduction. That’s how pathogens identify themselves and
        uncover their real “targets”, keeping and multiplying themselves
        as allogenic particles through the destruction of a biosystem as
        a whole. The problem of the DNA sequences migration in
        chromosomes may be discussed more globally (oncogenes, HIV
        genome or any other transposons whose purposes are still unclear
        for us). Moving along a genome as if over a context continuum,
        they obtain new meanings and other semantics which depend on
        their location in a 3D space of interphase chromosomes. The same
        logic is also true for “genetically-engineered” transgenesises
        of plants and animals. A growing number of artificial
        transgenetic organisms threatens with a global and rapid
        degeneration of all creatures living on Earth, because an
        uncontrolled automatic sign reconstruction of higher-ranked
        genetic codes, occurring after the introduction of foreign DNA
        molecules, isn’t taken into consideration. Practically
        uncontrolled intertaxonic transfer of foreign DNA-sequences, an
        avalanche-like semantic chaos in chromosomes and metabolic chaos
        in all biosystems (including human beings) will be the result of
        these genetically-engineered manipulations. It’s becoming hard
        to slur over the first alarming signals.</font></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><font size="3">The rather abstract
        theoretical structures of genetic material transpositions we
        propose are confirmed not only by the example of transgenetic
        biosystems, but also by R.B.Hesin’s fundamental work [47].
        Euchromatic genes, moving to an intercalar heterochromatin,
        produce a positioning effect, i.e. they are inactivated in some
        somatic cells and continue to function in others. Oncogenic
        cellular sequences are able to build-in in retroviral structures
        which didn’t originally have their own oncogenes. As a result,
        relatively non-hazardous viruses sometimes become tumorigenic.
        For instance, the RaLV rat virus might transform, having
        included master’s determinants in the genome, into the RaSV
        sarcoma virus. Cellular oncogenes, like viral ones, acquire a
        transforming activity if the lengthy repeated viral end
        sequences (LTR) are alloyed to oncogenes’ 5’-ends. In
        appropriate surroundings, proviruses including HIV viruses (as
        we think) are converted into latent (“silent”) genetic elements.
        They can persist in a master’s genome without producing any harm
        to it namely owing to the cellular DNA’s neighboring sequences
        repressing their activity. Taking into account this statement of
        Hesin’s, it’s possible to imagine a reverse situation, namely,
        the HIV genome activation in an environment of other DNA
        sequences when a cell in another DNA context already interprets
        HIV as a hostile semantic structure, but can do nothing to
        defend itself. However, as Mr. Hesin stresses, both
        peculiarities of the chromosomal DNA adjacent sections and
        operational principle which determine a provirus activity, are
        still a mystery. The mystery will remain unresolved, unless we
        apply new measurement criteria (semantically-vocal, wave or
        image measurements, i.e. the criteria we propose) to the genome.
        In this aspect, an interesting comparison of chromosome semantic
        and holographic information appears. A higher biosystem genome
        has several levels of information non-locality, “smearing” and
        redundancy, with a chromosome continuum holographic memory being
        one of them. Information locality and unambiguity of the
        genome’s mobile elements, the transposons, is contraposed to it;
        however, the multi-vector meanings of this information are
        developed dependent on a changing context of the transposon
        context surrounding; at the same time, transposons themselves
        are the triggers initiating the appearance, disappearance and
        repetition of the texts. A context “game” (combinatorial
        analysis) depends on current metabolic requirements of cells,
        tissues and an organism. The difference between a text and a
        context is conditional and depends on the domain of a part and
        an integer in a genome. The boundaries between the part and the
        integer are conditional and are likely to have a
        morpho-functional character which depends on an organism’s part
        differentiation at the cell, tissue, organ and biosystem levels.
        A finer ranking - by functional and metabolic areas of a cell
        which are controlled by certain chromosome sections (up to
        protein-genetic and exon-intronic splitting) - may also exist.
        Each of these quanta is an integral system in relation to
        itself, and just a part if the division rank is higher. Is it
        here that metabolic pathologies and herontologic manifestations
        are rooted when a biosystem stops identifying and
        differentiating many-sided patterns of a part and an integer?
        The HIV genome, like a transposon and a conditional part, might
        be invisible for a cell under some DNA contexts of master
        chromosomes . This is the way in which molecular-semantic
        mimicry of pathogenic chromosome structures is produced. Each
        coding-noncoding homonymous (or synonymous) and any other DNA
        sequence can be considered as a potentially multi-meaning
        pseudo-noised signal (signals) or as an image (images) which has
        to be identified and understood on the background of other
        dynamic gene images. The genetic apparatus amplifies each image
        signal and picks up the amplified signals out of the background
        (context, noise) not through the noise suppression procedure. On
        the contrary, a cell, a tissue and an organism use the
        background changing context as a means of extraction,
        amplification and to understand the meaning of each of these
        available image signals. It’s also logical to discuss in the
        same way the role of 3’- and 5’ - flanking sequences of protein
        genes highlighting one or another meaning. If we realized that
        the proposed mechanism of the dynamic game of genetic text
        meanings could play an important role in HIV and cancer
        development and in an organism’s entire metabolic status on the
        whole and if we accepted the idea that the comparison of a
        genome with natural texts and images wasn’t just a poetic
        metaphor, then real opportunities for the creation of a new
        biosystem management strategy, including management of viruses
        and oncogenes behavior, would emerge.</font></p>

    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><font size="3">We have already
        mentioned some similarities between the Background Principle and
        Gerhard Thomas’ multi-vector logic (keno-grammar) and the
        prospects of these methodologies for the extraction and
        recognition of genetic or even metabolic vectors of
        multicellular organisms’ live functions. There’s one other
        direction in the natural languages theory, which, we hope, is
        applicable to genetic linguistic. This direction was developed
        by V.V.Nalimov and is linked with a probabilistic approach to
        understanding a language [22, 43]. V.V.Nalimov proposed that the
        semantics of any actual text (including a genetic one, we
        believe) could be described by its own distribution function
        (probability density), r (m ). Text revision and evolution are
        linked with a spontaneous manifestation of the filter r (y/m ),
        multiplicatively interacting with the initial function r (m ),
        in a certain situation y. We consider a “y-change” in a genetic
        text to be the natural transpositions of the DNA mobile
        elements, recombinations, the slicing and the alloying. The
        incorrect (for a biosystem) transpositions of its own (or
        foreign) DNA mobile elements, mutations and artificial
        transgenic manipulations are considered “unnatural changes”. An
        introduction of viral genomes, the HIV genome for instance, into
        a biosystem’s chromosome material, relates to a “specific class
        of unnatural changes”. The interaction of the r (y/m ) filter
        with the initial function r (m ) is ruled by known Buys’
        formula:</font></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><font size="3">r (m/y) = kr(m ) r(y/m
        ),</font></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><font size="3">where</font></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><font size="3">r (m/y) = distribution
        function determining the semantic of a new text after the
        “y-changes”</font></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><font size="3">k = normalization
        constant.</font></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><font size="3">According to
        V.V.Nalimov, Buys’ formula comes forward as a syllogism: based
        on the two statements -&nbsp;<br>
        r (m) and r (m/ y), a text with a new semantic r (m/ y) comes to
        life. Let’s assume that Buys-Nalimov’s logic is applicable to
        genetic “texts”. Then the “idea” of these “texts” taken as a
        whole is determined by 3 weight correlations which the r (m )
        function specifies. “Meanings”, being a qualitative parameter in
        nature, obtain a new quantitative characteristic. With the help
        of the conditional distribution function r (m/y) V.V.Nalimov
        presents a new interpretation, somewhat different from that used
        in Buys’ statistics. In his theory, r (m/y) shows the
        distribution density of a random value y under the given value m
        . Therefore, not y, but m can be considered as an argument of
        for the r (m/y) function which plays the role of a filter. We
        think that the “y-changes” factor, initiating and exciting a new
        semantic situation, is a key element in this model. Namely this
        factor stimulates the unfolding of an increasing number of
        alternative and new meanings,&nbsp; as well as of holographic
        and other images in a variable semantic space of mobile DNAs in
        a multicellular organism’s genome. The genome-carrying continuum
        passes through the dynamic filter&nbsp;r (y/m) responding to it
        by dramatic “y-changes”. It is significant that V.V.Nalimov had
        been puzzled by the question of what permitted the reproduction
        of the non-trivial r (y/m ) filters, but didn’t find an answer.
        Nevertheless, at the same time he put forward an idea about the
        role played by the environment and about a variety of situations
        which could act as a source and a reason for adequate filter
        formation. Here, V.V.Nalimov practically came up to the
        above-discussed Background Principle. After the unification and
        combination of Nalimov’s model and the Background Principle
        statements it’s logical to consider that the y-factor is nothing
        but a context (background) mechanism of switching on the r (y/m
        ) filters. These filters pick up the semantic loading and
        meaning which are determined by an actual metabolic, including
        genetic, situation: for instance - the necessity for a cell to
        synthesize a huge amount of catalase at a given moment, a
        process which is accompanied by a choice and the expression of
        the catalase gene from a gene multi-meaning continuum. Herein
        another, and perhaps the key mechanism of genome differential
        activation to produce different proteins, is seen. Therefore,
        the Background Principle and Buys-Nalimov’s logic became linked
        by identical natural definitions. G.Thomas’ keno-grammar [26],
        which is largely based on context orientations in choosing
        priorities to manage complicated situations, is likely
        convergent with the above-mentioned ideas.</font></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><font size="3">Now back to the
        “genetic engineering”. Let’s also remind of the “chromosomal
        engineering”, when large blocks of a genome are used for
        production of useful hybrids. From the probabilistic approach to
        the mobile polysemantic chromosomal continuum, these
        “engineering” seem rather gloomy. Any manipulation here is an
        instant (as compared to the evolution pace) creation of new
        y-factors by people (and not by the evolution) and therefore, a
        mutation of the r (y/m ) purporting filters, unhampered by any
        time (evolutionary) frames. That’s the Earth’s genetic fund
        forthcoming chaos.</font></p>

        <p><font size="3">IX. The genetic apparatus paradox</font></p>
      </b></div>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><font size="3">The paradox of the
        genetic apparatus lies in the combination of two normally
        opposite properties - the stability of the information
        transferred from one generation to another, and the genome's
        volatility [47]. Genomic mobility is provided by polynucleotide
        transpositions, soliton-like non-linear dynamics (electric
        acoustic), and conformative and halogen restructuring. These
        non-random (programmed) movements of a chromosome continuum in
        live tissues are subtly and extensively distributed in a
        biosystem's space-time. The said dynamics is a means of the wave
        management of re-distribution of an organism’s various parts
        among each other. At the same time, it’s a method of metabolic
        event sequence organization. This strong sign chromosomal
        non-linear dynamics, which is easily found even in vitro, is
        realized through its isomorphous image in an organism’s space
        and time structure [32]. As a result, in a chromosomal
        continuum, as in a polysemantic and multiplex holographic
        formation, a permanent and variable semantic “game” of meanings
        goes on. Some kind of “endogenous semiotic show” of
        optical-acoustic regulatory (sign) images, which also have
        variable meanings, takes place. One of these chromosome images
        was experimentally found in many laboratories and is generally
        known as the phantom leaf effect (ref. to [32]). The phantom
        leaf effect theory is based on the principles of holography [32,
        37]. It’s possible to say that the “game of meanings” is a
        function of sign dynamics of interphase chromosomes. This is a
        prerequisite for storing and processing vast volumes of
        information when a super-small volume of zygote mesomorphic
        chromosomes is able to operate a multi-vector and many-sided
        logic of development of extremely sophisticated biological
        systems. This is the origin of the idea that an essentially
        novel approach strategy to HIV and cancer treatment presumes the
        understanding and the possibility of managing a multi-vector
        genome logic. </font><i><font size="3">If we manage, applying
          genetic engineering methods, to purposefully and
          site-specifically introduce certain context DNA sequences to
          the 3’ and 5’ ends of oncogenes or HIV-genome, then it’s
          reasonable to expect the inactivation of their pathologic
          expression. On the other side, if we know the principles of
          ribosome operation in a context orientation mode, then we can
          successfully fight HIV in a ribosomal wave (laser, solitonic,
          polarization and radio wave) regulation zone. Ribosomes,
          synthesizing HIV proteins, must have thin wave vectors for
          management through context-background paths. Knowing them,
          it’s possible to suppress viral protein synthesis by external
          artificial modified fields similar to those normal cells use.</font></i></p>

            Preliminary experiments.</font></p>
      </b></div>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><font size="3">Now, let’s turn to
        another genome operation phenomenon - that is, a supposed effect
        of quantum non-locality of chromosome sign conditions, which we
        have more or less experimentally confirmed [8, 37]. The idea of
        quantum non-locality was proposed by Einstein, Podolsky and
        Rosen [4] (EPR-effect). This effect is well in line with quantum
        physics experimental evidence. In short, the EPR-effect states
        that elementary particles, two photons for instance, which have
        initially been in a so-called “entangled” state, retain a mutual
        bond (this bond may be called “informational”) by quantum
        parameters (for example, by polarization), even if these
        elementary particles are removed from one another by any
        arbitrary distance. If the polarization of one of the particles
        has changed for any reason (for example, the photon passed
        through an optically-active layer and recorded the polarization
        modulations, then this photon disappears, but it manages to
        instantly transfer the recorded polarization information to
        another photon. To be more correct, it’s not a “transfer”, it’s
        a transition of one photon into another by means of a permissive
        teleportation mechanism. The first changed photon turns into the
        second one, independent of the distance between them. The second
        photon becomes a complete analogue of the first one. If this
        situation is in some way reflected in the genetic apparatus,
        then we rocket to new and higher orbits in understanding a
        metabolic processes and the Life phenomenon as a whole. In
        strictly physical terms, the EPR effect as a phenomenon of
        photon teleportation was correctly confirmed only in 1997 [2].</font></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><font size="3">Other researchers soon
        obtained similar results, and not only based on photons.
        Multi-frequency physical fields are now teleported. Based on
        this data, it’s possible to suppose that photon fields, emitted
        by chromosomes as sign fields, can be teleported within or even
        outside the organism’s space. The same is true for wave photon
        fronts, which were read from the chromosome continuum similar to
        reading from a multiplex hologram. If photons are transformed
        into radio waves (the situation we found - ref. to [8, 33, 37])
        through the EPR-mechanism, then this phenomenon is vital. In
        fact, the importance of quantum non-locality existence for a
        genome is hard to overestimate. We put forward and published
        this idea when we identified, with the help of the equipment we
        had developed, what was probably a more sophisticated variant of
        the EPR-effect. The said equipment includes a specially-designed
        laser which is capable of transforming its own photons into
        radio waves [46, 37, 8, 34]. The laser features a unique light
        beam dynamic polarization which could in some way simulate a
        dynamic polarization of chromosome laser radiations. It converts
        its photons (l =632.8 nm) into kHz-MHz-band radio waves upon the
        interaction of its beam with matter and the introduction of
        probing photons back in the laser resonator. Under these
        conditions, we suppose, pairs of entangled photons born in a
        gaseous phase of the laser optic resonator are transformed
        during their splitting and interaction with any body, including
        the laser mirrors, into radio waves. Photons were found to be
        able to localize in fractal clusters of the laser metal mirrors.
        If photons are probing an outer object, then the mirrors “store”
        its spectral characteristics. In such a way we have managed to
        record polarization &amp; radio wave information of DNA
        preparations. This information carries morphogenetic signals.
        This fact enabled us to develop a fundamentally new type of
        dynamic polarization laser-radio wave spectroscopy and to
        investigate quantum non-local (teleportative) genetic processes.</font></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><font size="3">We’d like to make some
        additional comments on the importance of quantum teleportation
        of genetic &amp; metabolic information for biology on the whole.
        Quantum non-locality of genetic (chromosomal) information as a
        method of manifestation of its wave total distribution
        (continuity) in the space of multicellular biosystems seems to
        be just a particular case. In biosystems, there are at least six
        non-locality levels:</font></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><font size="3">The first level is the
        constitutional (organism) level. Here, non-locality is expressed
        through the regeneration ability that organisms such as the <i>
          planarium </i> worms possess. After sectioning off any part,
        the worms’ body is able to reproduce an entire organism through
        regeneration. In other words, in this case there’s no link point
        between the genetic information common pool and a part of a
        biosystem. The same is also applicable to vegetative
        reproduction of plants.</font></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><font size="3">The second level is the
        cellular level. It is possible to grow an entire organism from
        each cell (not only from a zygote). Despite the difficulties,
        it’s also possible for animal biosystems. Each cell is a
        potential continuum of an organism.</font></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><font size="3">The third level is a
        cellular-nuclear level. Removal of nucleus from somatic and
        reproductive cells with a consequent introduction of another
        nucleus inside doesn’t impede a normal organism development.
        Such type of cloning has already been carried out at a higher
        biosystem level, on sheep for instance. Each nucleus of a cell
        is also a potential continuum of a biosystem. There’s no
        localization of genetic potencies at the level of individual
        cells.</font></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><font size="3">The fourth level is a
        molecular level. The ribosome “reads” informational RNA either
        by individual codons, or on the whole, with the consideration of
        context, i.e. non-locally and continuously.</font></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><font size="3">The fifth level is a
        chromosomal-holographic level. A genome possesses a holographic
        memory [37] which in nature is a typically-distributed
        (non-local) associative memory. At this and the next level
        non-locality obtains a new feature - a dualistic substance-wave
        character, since electromagnetic and/or acoustic fields,
        bringing out gene-wave information outside chromosomal material,
        “read” holograms as a substance. A physical field (or fields),
        marking the organism’s prospective space (calibration), comes on
        scene. The brain cortex holographic memory, establishing mental,
        semantic and image spaces calibrating potential actions of
        higher biosystems, is likely to belong to this category. In this
        way, social and genetic processes are alike.</font></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><font size="3">The sixth level is a
        genome quantum non-locality. At the levels of up to 6th, genetic
        information non-locality is realized in an organism’s space. The
        6th level is of a special nature, since it acquires a new
        quality. It’s manifested within the frames of one of the quantum
        non-locality forms, namely, in the permissive form we postulate
        in the current paper. In this case, non-locality is realized
        both by biosystem space and by its own, shrinkable to zero,
        time. Gene-wave programs, instantly spreading in such a way,
        simultaneously operate in an organism “here and there” and
        therefore, the semantic construction “now and then” loses its
        meaning. And this is a strategic factor and a vital evolutionary
        achievement of multicellular biosystems. Billions of organism’s
        cells have to instantly “know” a lot of information about each
        other. Without the “wave information instancy” phenomenon, a
        giant multicellular continuum of higher biosystems won’t be able
        to completely coordinate a metabolic process and its
        physiological and other functions. The intercellular diffusion
        of signal substances and nerve processes are too inert for this
        purpose. Even if we assume that sign electromagnetic fields are
        involved in an intercellular transfer process occurring with the
        speed of light (this assumption is quite reasonable), it’s not
        enough. A quantum non-locality mechanism, applicable to the
        genetic apparatus and which can act as an instantly-distributed
        quantum (wave) object isomorphous with substantial chromosomes,
        is required. Using non-locality, the genetic apparatus of higher
        biosystems creates an unparalleled phenomenon, where for certain
        intervals of time the “here and there” and “now and then”
        structures operate within the biosystems’ “closed” space-time as
        a continuity providing the organism with intrinsic
        super-coherence, information overredundance, a
        super-informativity and linkage and, as a result, proper
        integrity (survival). The ability of lower organisms’ (hydros,
        worms, amphibian, lizards, crustaceans) tissues and organs to
        regenerate (people have largely lost this ability ) is a
        manifestation of this phenomenon. But, considering the biosystem
        wave self-organization principles we are developing, it can be
        re-activated. The world’s first successful adaptation of donor
        tissues implanted to a blind man, which helped to return sight
        function to the patient, is a good example of regeneration. The
        principles behind this surgical operation and regeneration
        process is described in [33-35].</font></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><font size="3">At the same time,
        theoretical and experimental research in this field is just
        emerging and needs further physical and mathematical
        understanding and development.</font></p>

            information on laser mirrors</font></p>
      </b></div>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><font size="3">Now, let’s return to
        some features of the phenomenon of long-term recording of
        dynamic photon polarization-radio wave information on laser
        mirrors. We think this is linked with the phenomenon of photon
        fields localization (compression) in the system of correlated
        dispersers of laser mirrors. Given that the disperser material
        possesses a low radiation absorption ability, the external light
        field is capable to persist in the system for a long time
        without dissipation into other forms of energy. The reason for
        localization is connected with the interference of many
        times-diffracted waves. An external electromagnetic signal (in
        our case, it’s a laser beam modulated by polarization, for
        instance, by a DNA preparation) is localized (“recorded”) in the
        system of non-uniform laser mirrors. Later, the signal can be
        “read” without a significant loss of information in the form of
        isomorphously (in relation to photons) polarized radio waves.
        Theoretical research on a strain state of localized photons [12,
        14-19, 24] seem to support these ideas. If this opinion is
        correct, then a chromosomal apparatus may also be considered as
        a fractal medium of localized photons accumulation, creating a
        coherent continuum with a quantum-nonlocally-distributed
        polarization radio wave genetic information. To some extent,
        this is in correspondence with our idea of genome quantum
        non-locality manifesting in one of its forms - ref. to [8, 34,
        37]. It’s possible that the apoptosis phenomenon, which is
        likely to be involved in the regulation of multicellular
        creatures’ life time, is connected with an abnormal compression
        of photons by the nucleus of a cell, which are accumulated to a
        maximal value and then destroy the nucleus. The background
        principle of gene operation (including anti-oncogenes) may be
        another supplemental apoptosis regulation mechanism. For
        instance, an anti-oncogene coding the p53 protein could be
        controlled through the introduction of the DNA artificial
        flanking contexts from 3’-and 5’-ends of the p53 gene.</font></p>

            gene wave forms existence</font></p>
      </b></div>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><font size="3">We are unaware (with
        some exceptions, of course) of modern publications on wave
        genetic theory and practice, as available in the major
        scientific journals. In the 1920-1940s, A.G.Gurwitch,
        A.A.Lyubitchev and V.N.Beklemishev, who developed the first
        theoretical models, were pioneers in this field; their ideas are
        described in detail in [32, 33]. In this paper, we are trying to
        produce more developed opinions of some possible synthesis
        mechanisms and functions of wave genetic structures,
        attributable to higher biosystems, as well as of the methods
        applicable for simulation of sign wave processes in chromosomes
        and model units simulating chromosome field functions and
        transferring wave genes. A publication and a patent, granted for
        the development of a device for the transfer of wave genes from
        a donor biosystem to an accepting one, are worth mentioning as
        an example of a rarely-appearing event. The said research was
        carried out by Yu.V.Dzang Kangeng [39, 40]. Kangeng’s device for
        a directed wave transmission of oncologic, including genetic,
        information to change hereditary characteristics of a biological
        accepting object is of a special interest. Unfortunately,
        there’s no theoretical interpretation of the device operation
        principles. Kangeng’s device has some common functional features
        with the equipment we developed and whose operation is based on
        similar principles. Kangeng’s device includes space elements
        (forms) which make it possible to split the radiation of a
        high-frequency SHF electromagnetic field generator into two
        orthogonally-polarized beams which repeatedly, as in our
        installation (in our case, it’s a laser beam transforming into
        radio waves), were passing through a donor biosystem and an
        accepting biosystem. Dzang Kangeng used a hexahedron, a cone, a
        sphere and a parabolic-reflector aerial as types of special
        forms. These forms provide a specific spinning (polarization) of
        the SHF (super-high frequency) field electromagnetic vectors. In
        our laser design, one of the mirrors used also had the form of a
        parabolic-reflector aerial directed to a resonator. During
        numerous repeated passes through an optically-active (an
        electromagnetic wave polarization rotating plane)
        hetero-liquid-crystalline donor biosystem, the organism’s
        tissues modulate the radiation (in our case, this is laser-radio
        wave radiation) by polarization, which is strengthened owing to
        repeated passes and is repeatedly and over a long time delivered
        to the accepting biosystem. In this process, the generator
        electromagnetic field “stores” the donor biosystem gene-sign
        polarization modulations in its “memory” then resonantly
        interacts with gene-sign polarization distribution of the
        accepting biosystem electromagnetic field. If the donor
        biosystem is at an early morphogenesis stage accompanied by an
        intense cell fission rate, it can’t be excluded that the
        supposed polarization resonances are also of a holographic
        nature. This many times-amplified signal, carrying the wave
        information that was “read” from the donor biosystem chromosome
        continuum, passes through the substance-wave structure of the
        accepting biosystem and makes it execute new
        gene-wave-polarization programs by means of the variation of
        their differential polarization structure. Changes in the
        accepting biosystem's gene-wave-polarization structure induced
        by the donor in the process of the field integration (“wave
        heterosis”) leads to a restructuring of its morphologic (genetic
        and phenotypic) characteristics. Shear wave correlations of
        polarization angles during the donor-accepting mixing of
        physical waves resulted in the acquisition of new morpho-genetic
        and biological properties from the accepting organism, are one
        of the most important quantum-electrodynamic events of the “wave
        hybridization” process. This fact allowed Dzang Kangeng with the
        help of the wave method to transfer genetic information from
        ducks to hens, for instance. Hybrid chickens of hens had typical
        features of a duck - a flat beak, an elongated neck, larger
        internal organs ( heart, liver, stomach and bowels). The weight
        of a one-year-old hen-duck hybrid was 70% higher than the weight
        of hens grown from irradiated eggs. The second generation of the
        hen-duck hybrids retained all changes, which were obtained in
        the first generation, even without further re-radiation. A wave
        transfer of peanuts’ features to sunflower seeds resulted in the
        change of form, taste and odor of a hybrid plant, which became
        similar to those of peanuts. Productivity grew by 1.8-fold; new
        features are transferred from one generation to another even
        without further re-radiation.</font></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><font size="3">Let’s highlight some
        common features of the experiments Dzang Kangeng and we
        independently carried out: first and foremost, they demonstrate
        the possibility of genetic information existence in a wave form.
        This similarity is in the polarization modulation of the
        radiation orthogonal beams with intensity re-distribution in
        primary orthogonal beams with a frequency secured in the radio
        wave spectrum we register, by a donor organism. The spinning
        polarization planes here act as gene-semiotic structures whose
        biological meanings are identified and coded by angular and
        intensity shifts by a frequency spectrum. Similarly-polarized
        waves are known to be able to interfere, while
        orthogonally-polarized waves do not interfere at all. Waves with
        a partially-coinciding polarization produce, dependent on their
        polarization coincidence degree, a more or less sharp contrast
        interference picture. In other words, an angle cosine of each
        vector in relation to their registration plane or to the wave
        interference plane is a crucial factor.</font></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><font size="3">Biology, including
        genetics and embryology, has already come to a turning point in
        its development, which is similar to the period when physics
        first admitted the idea that the properties of waves and
        particles didn’t contradict each other and were even
        complementary in quantum objects. A huge number of facts and
        scientific research outcomes available in modern molecular
        biology, genetics and embryology, can’t be understood without
        such a definition as physical fields, for instance, or without
        the application of quantum electrodynamics principles. The idea
        of lingual attributes of higher biosystems’ genome is a kind of
        humanitarian counterweight to an apparently excessive physical
        interpretation of basic Life function phenomena. The pace at
        which this idea is gaining acceptance by society is rather slow
        - in fact furious resistance has been encountered from certain
        circles. The current situation is easy to explain: the subject
        of Life is too complicated. Nevertheless, the time has come. If
        we are too late understanding the wave gene-sign functions of
        biosystems, it is possible that such diseases as cancer and HIV
        will destroy our society, or at least cause irreversible damage.
        We’ll also lose the opportunity for a mighty jump in
        biotechnology and biocomputing. Last but not least, we’ll also
        lose an opportunity to purposefully, rationally and positively
        influence sociogenetic and demographic processes. Following the
        above-described logic, we are coming to the conclusion that
        human speech structures, which provide the major information
        influx for mankind, possess fractally-scaled supergenetic
        properties. Evolution of society is similar to an organism’s
        morphogenesis. Books, libraries, movies, computer memory and
        people’s live speech in the end are the functional analogues of
        a cell chromosomal apparatus. The aim of these chromosomes is to
        control the creation of society space (houses, roads, oil- and
        gas pipelines, telephony, the Internet) and to arrange
        functional and structural relationships among the people inside
        it. Chromosomal sign properties, which have a lot in common with
        organisms, have a substance-wave nature. For instance, a movie
        showing an ideal model of a social structure and people’s
        relations within its frames is a substantial (material)
        formation (video tapes). However, it uses a mental-wave method
        to input information (light, sound, speech, idea, image). That’s
        the method chromosomes apply. The latter produce marking and
        calibration fields to arrange the organism’s space and also
        control information &amp; metabolic relations, using, in
        particular, quasi-speech methods (let’s remember context
        orientations in the protein synthesis and function of oncogenes
        and HIV). Therefore, people ought to carefully study the
        operational principles of their own genetic apparatus and the
        “tricks” HIVs play to “mislead” our chromosomes. This kind of
        study is especially crucial today when Russia, and not only
        Russia, could face a demographic and social collapse within the
        next 5 to 10 years.</font></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><font size="3">We have declared the
        theoretical approach to describe the logic of sign speech-wave
        relationships between HIV genomes and a master cell as well as
        the oncogene behavior logic. However, it’s not enough. We must
        obtain a set of key tools which will enable us to follow up at
        least the simplest wave command biocomputing functions of our
        chromosomes (1) and the reprogramming of our chromosomes by
        nucleotide sequences of HIVs and oncogenes. We have already
        developed this set of tools - it’s a laser uniquely reflecting
        coherent polarization-laser-radio wave (PLRW) quantum-non-local
        sign processes in chromosomes. Physico-mathematical formalism
        characterizing the PLRW-quantum processes in such appliances is
        presented in our research ( 2). PLRW-spectroscopy is the basis
        of wave information recording on laser mirrors - the phenomenon
        we have discovered. We have also managed to record information
        from specially prepared mesomorphic DNA matrixes, to broadcast
        it in a waveform at a distance of 1 m and to introduce it in
        accepting biosystems. As an accepting biosystem, we took plant
        seeds. Using this phenomenon, we effected a “wave reparation” of
        a genome of radioactively-damaged old seeds of Athaliana
        gathered in the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant area in 1987, and
        initiated drastic changes in stem and tuber phenotype in the
        second generation of the Solanum tuberosum plant. These
        biological influences don’t have the nature of mutations, they
        only have a sense meaning and are just another evidence that
        genetic information can exist in the form of electromagnetic
        fields.</font></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><font size="3">No less important is
        the fact that genetic information can be recorded, stored, read,
        transmitted and introduced in accepting biosystems. Here, two
        vital factors emerge. The first one is that the recording of
        vast information volumes (including the genetic one) is an
        unparalleled event which confirms that it’s possible to develop
        principally new carriers of the dynamic super-capacity analog
        memory (images, texts). This is rather important for future
        biocomputing. The second factor is that owing to the PLRW
        phenomenon we enter a huge area of genetico-metabolic wave sign
        processes. Numerous and unclear events of distant “recognition”
        of the antigene-antibody and tRNA anticodon-iRNA codon pairs, as
        well as complementary mutual recognitions of DNA single chains,
        self-construction of ribosomes, recognition sites of ferments,
        careful piloting and landing of transposons in the DNA and so
        on, are also well contained within the frames of these
        processes. None of these phenomena can be explained by only
        Brownian movement and adjacent van der Waals, ion, hydrogen and
        electrostatic interactions.</font></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><font size="3">And finally, the most
        important thing for us in the context of the ideas we propose is
        a wave and sign behavior of viruses, HIV or influenza, for
        instance. Viruses can be considered as “orphaned” cells which
        retained a minimum of chromosomal information required for a
        wave search of landing site on a master cell and exact place to
        cut-in own DNA as a transposon in the master cell’s DNA with
        consequent possible precise re-transpositions. Wave “languages”,
        which viruses use during the information contact with a cell’s
        surface and its genome, are the most vulnerable parts of a
        virus. Viruses use these “languages” to enter the semantic space
        of a cell and then to “mislead” the cell; after that, they
        undergo mimicry and are reprogrammed, reproduced and thus
        survive in the end. Cells are likely to be able to “mislead”
        viruses as well, creating a kind of “wave immunity”. That’s why
        a certain balance of powers in the fight exists; the said
        balance can shift in favor of a virus - for instance, in favor
        of influenza virus if the temperature starts fluctuating.
        Cooling of a blood circulation in nose mucosa capillaries
        changes the temperature of liquid crystals in chromosome blood
        cells. At the same time, protective wave programs recorded on
        high topologies of chromosome mesomorphic phases can only be
        slightly distorted. As a result, the “cold temperature
        information breach” appears and is used by influenza virus to
        reproduce. As a response to this action, a compensatory reaction
        evolves in the organism, i.e. the body temperature goes up to a
        sub-lethal level of 41° C. According to our thinking, this
        reaction is designed to “submelt” mesomorphic phases of the
        virus nucleic acid and, therefore, to produce noise or
        completely erase virus wave programs which it needs to attack
        the organism’s wave semantic space, thus to kill the growing
        number of its cells. Virus genome acoustic fields tightly linked
        with photon ones might act as wave bioprograms. Using the method
        of correlative laser spectroscopy, we demonstrated drastic
        changes in acoustic performance of the DNA liquid crystals in
        vitro at temperatures of 40-41° C; the results obtained
        partially confirmed our suppositions. And that’s only an example
        of wave sign processes in the relationship between the influenza
        virus and the human organism. Similar sense relationships exist
        between HIV and human cells, and the same issues arise - how to
        correctly find a landing site on a cell’s surface and precisely
        build-in the DNA (reverse transcriptasal copy of a viral RNA) as
        a mimicking transposon into the master cell DNA. Thereafter, the
        task is to get accurately re-transposed in a proper place on a
        chromosome and to detect and realize itself as a reproducing
        pathogen.</font></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><font size="3">For now we can
        initially list the bottlenecks of HIV wave programs and name
        countermeasures to eliminate the problems:</font></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><font size="3">Searching and
        recognition of HIV on a landing site (by altering the radiation
        nature of a virus and/or sites of landing on a cell, it’s
        necessary to distort the system of resonance-wave recognition
        mechanisms).</font></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><font size="3">Searching and
        recognition of a viral DNA on the landing site by the master

        the system of resonance-wave recognition mechanisms).</font></p>

    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><font size="3">Any violation of even
        small wave sign resonances in this triad will result in the loss
        of infectious ability of HIV and other viruses, and Nature has
        created an example. As it was already mentioned, it’s an
        organism’s temperature mode. In ways similar to the one found by
        Nature it’ll become possible to design a simple “wave” vaccine
        against HIV and other viruses and bacteria. Our goal is to study
        the “alphabet” and “grammar” of wave “languages” of viruses’
        genomes. And the foundation for this study has already been
        laid. A laser capable to “read” PLRW-wave genetico-metabolic
        information has been developed. However, the research in this
        field is rather difficult due to intrinsically natural inertia
        of the material understanding of genetic and metabolic
        information. Technical issues also exist. The laser we use
        generates only red photons, while the chromosomal apparatus of
        human beings and viruses uses a wide spectrum of coherent
        radiation ranged from 250 nm to 800 nm. Therefore, it’s
        necessary to design lasers which function in a full span of the
        spectrum visible area. This aim is technically feasible, but
        significant investments are needed to achieve it. In our
        opinion, all attempts to produce a material vaccine or other
        drugs to fight against the HIV or influenza virus will fail.
        Viruses continuously change their antigenic composition and thus
        bury all efforts of immunologists and other scientists engaged
        in the vaccine development. Efforts to chemically block certain
        stages of virus morphogenesis are inefficient and only poison
        human organisms. Wave vaccine is a reality. This vaccine would
        be non-invasive and environmentally-friendly, since it touches
        only a narrow area of wave sign relations between a virus and a
        cell.</font></p>
