      <div align="center"><big><b>Substance Discovered That Induces Hair
            Follicle Formation In The Mature Skin Cells Of Mice</b></big><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Everyone has bad hair days. For 30 million men in the United
      States, roughly 40 percent of those over 35, every day is a no
      hair day. The good news is that thanks to new research, baldness
      may be fading away.<br>
      <br>
      Researchers from the Howard Hughes Institute at the University of
      Chicago have induced hair follicle formation in the mature skin
      cells of mice. Follicle formation is a once-in-a-lifetime event
      that ordinarily happens only during early embryogenesis.<br>
      <br>
      Their findings, reported in the November 25 issue of Cell,
      indicate that a molecule called beta-catenin may be the long
      sought message that instructs embryonic cells to become hair
      follicles, suggesting possible treatments for premature baldness.<br>
      <br>
      "Beta-catenin can cause adult epithelial cells to revert to an
      embryonic-like state where they have the ability to choose to
      become a hair follicle," says Elaine Fuchs, Amgen Professor in the
      Departments of Molecular Genetics and Cell Biology, Howard Hughes
      Investigator, and lead author of the paper. “This is exciting
      because current treatments for baldness only work if there are
      living follicles left, or if the patient undergoes hair transplant
      surgery. Our research shows that new follicles can be created from
      adult skin cells if certain molecular players are induced to act.<br>
      <br>
      Beta-catenin performs two very different functions. In adult
      epithelial cells, it participates in binding neighboring cells
      together to facilitate cell-cell communication. But during
      embryogenesis, beta-catenin appears to have another role: it
      reacts with a molecule called LEF-1, which is expressed only in
      cells that will eventually become hair follicles. Together,
      beta-catenin and LEF-1 form a transcription factor that binds to
      the cell’s DNA and activates the genes that instruct the cell to
      become a hair follicle.<br>
      <br>
      Uri Gat, a postdoctoral fellow in Fuchs’s lab, created mice that
      constantly produced a stabilized form of beta-catenin in their
      skin. (Normally any excess beta-catenin that is not needed for
      cell-cell adhesion is quickly degraded.) "The process caused some
      epidermal cells to make the partner molecule, LEF-1," explains
      Fuchs. “Wherever both stabilized beta-catenin and LEF-1 were
      present in an epithelial cell, a new hair follicle formed. If we
      can induce those two partners at the right time, new hair could be
      formed in places where it has been lost.<br>
      <br>
      The genetically engineered mice were exceptionally hairy. In some
      mice, most skin cells became hair follicles.<br>
      <br>
      Unlike in embryogenesis, however, the genetically engineered skin
      of the transgenic mice made an endless supply of beta-catenin and
      benign follicle tumors formed.<br>
      <br>
      "This is a case of too much of a good thing leading to a bad
      thing," says Fuchs. She cautions that the use of these exciting
      findings will still need more work before hair growth can be
      induced without danger of unwanted side-effects. "If we can find a
      way to transiently express beta-catenin in these skin cells, just
      until new follicles are established, and then turn it off, we may
      be able to prevent tumor formation and still allow hair follicles
      to form," says Fuchs. The flip side of this, she says, is that it
      is also a potential tool to stop unwanted hair growth by
      inhibiting the pathway.<br>
      <br>
      It could also have applications in the agricultural industry, for
      example to engineer sheep with denser wool or thicker skin, Fuchs
      explains.<br>

      A new discovery showing how hair growth activated fat tissue
      growth in the skin below the hair follicle could lead to the
      development of a cream to dissolve fat. In particular, the protein
      that activated hair follicle growth was shown to also inhibit fat
      production.<br>
      <br>
      The world first research confirmed that changes in the hair growth
      cycle led to fluctuations in the thickness of the underlying fat
      layer of the skin -- essentially meaning that the skin can
      regulate fat production.<br>
      <br>
      The research was led by Professor Fiona Watt at King's College
      London in collaboration with Professor of Dermatology Rodney
      Sinclair from the University of Melbourne and Epworth Hospital.<br>
      <br>
      Professor Sinclair said these findings could potentially be used
      both as a means to replace fat lost in scar tissue or as a
      localized treatment for obesity.<br>
      <br>
      "The specific chemicals identified in this study could be produced
      synthetically and used in creams for topical application to the
      skin to modulate growth of fat beneath the skin."<br>
      <br>
      "A cream could trim fat specifically where it was applied by
      'pausing' the production of factors that contribute to fat cell
      growth." he said.<br>
      <br>
      The effect of changes in the fat tissue on the synchronized
      patterns of hair follicle growth has long been established.<br>
      <br>
      "This is the first demonstration that the opposite also holds true
      in that the skin below the hair follicle can regulate the
      development of fat," Professor Sinclair said.<br>
      <br>
      This discovery could also affect future treatment of obesity, male
      and female pattern baldness and alopecia -- male and female
      baldness -- an autoimmune condition that affects one to two per
      cent of the general population at some stage in their life.<br>

      The present invention relates to the use of Lhx2 as a target for
      modulating the hair growth. Screening assays for identifying
      agents which increase or decrease the expression or activity of
      Lhx2 are provided.<br>
      <br>
      <b>INTRODUCTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0001] This invention was made in the course of research sponsored
      by the National Institutes of Health (Grant No. R01-AR050452). The
      U.S. government may have certain rights in this invention.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0002] Hair follicle morphogenesis involves a temporal series of
      reciprocal interactions between the ectoderm and its underlying
      mesenchyme (Hardy (1992) Trends Genet. 8:55; Millar (2002) J.
      Invest. Dermatol. 118:216; Schmidt-Ullrich and Paus (2005)
      Bioessays 27:247). During embryogenesis, the skin epidermis
      develops from a single uniform layer of multipotent cells,
      separated from the mesenchymally-derived dermis by a basement
      membrane of extracellular matrix. Cells of this proliferative
      basal layer can be committed into one of two major lineages. To
      serve its function as a protective barrier, cells directed towards
      the epidermal lineage begin a program of terminal differentiation
      by detaching from the basement membrane, moving outward toward the
      skin surface, and undergoing metabolic changes to create a
      keratinized, stratified squamous cell layer. Alternatively, cells
      of the basal layer can give rise to hair follicles. In response to
      inductive signals, embryonic hair morphogenesis begins with a
      localized thickening of epidermal cells and a subsequent bud-like
      down-growth into the dermis. Known as a hair placode or hair germ,
      these cells send a reciprocal signal back to the underlying
      mesenchymal cells to organize into a dermal condensate, the
      precursor of the dermal papilla. As the hair follicle continues to
      develop by growing further down into the dermis, a group of
      rapidly proliferating follicular cells called the matrix surrounds
      the dermal papilla, forming the hair bulb. Cells losing contact
      with the hair bulb become the outer root sheath, contiguous with
      the interfollicular epidermis. The close association between the
      matrix and dermal papilla within the hair bulb likely results in
      another set of epithelial-mesenchymal exchange of signals to begin
      terminal hair differentiation. Specific hair lineages are adopted
      by the matrix cells as they move upward in concentric rings of
      cells to form the different layers of the hair follicle, including
      the inner root sheath and hair shaft. At some point during this
      morphogenetic process, stem cells residing in the bulge are
      specified and set aside for the postnatal hair cycle and epidermal
      repair.<br>
      <br>
      [0003] Some of the molecular events involved in hair follicle
      morphogenesis have been elucidated. In response to an inductive
      Wnt and an inhibitory Bmp signal (Noggin), small hair placodes bud
      from the epithelium, giving rise to larger hair germs (DasGupta
      and Fuchs (1999) Development 126:4557; Huelsken, et al. (2001)
      Cell 105:533; Botchkarev, et al. (1999) Nature Cell Biol. 1:158;
      Jamora, et al. (2003) Nature 422:317). In the presence of the
      mitogen Shh, these hair germs develop further and grow downwards
      to form a mature follicle that actively produces hair (Chiang, et
      al. (1999) Dev. Biol. 205:1; Oro and Higgins (2003) Dev. Biol.
      255:238; St-Jacques, et al. (1998) Curr. Biol. 8:1058). Although
      the molecular details of bud formation are still being defined,
      the general features of this process are repeated at the start of
      each postnatal hair cycle when multipotent stem cells in the hair
      follicle bulge become activated to initiate a new round of hair
      growth. In addition, the early epithelial remodeling to form the
      hair germ shares many features with the development of other
      epithelial tissues and organs, including feathers, teeth, and
      mammary glands (Hogan (1999) Cell 96:225; Pispa and Thesleff
      (2003) Dev. Biol. 262:195; Yue, et al. (2005) Nature 438:1026).
      Understanding how tissues form buds which then progress along
      different lineages is predicated on elucidating the molecular
      mechanisms that funnel these early signaling pathways into a
      transcriptional program that drives morphogenesis.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0004] The present invention is a method for modulating hair
      growth by regulating the expression or activity of Lhx2. The
      present invention also relates to the use of Lhx2 in a screening
      assay to identify an agent which modulates hair growth. The
      screening assay involves contacting a test cell expressing a
      reporter operably linked to an Lhx2 promoter with an agent and
      detecting expression of the reporter in the test cell, wherein a
      decrease in reporter expression is indicative of an agent which
      stimulates hair growth and an increase in reporter expression is
      indicative of an agent which inhibits hair growth.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0005] FIG. 1 shows that Lhx2 maintains follicle stem cells in a
      quiescent, inactive state. FIG. 1A shows CD34 quantification by
      flow cytometry in telogen and anagen follicles during the first
      postnatal cycle. FIG. 1B shows loss of BrdU label retention in KO
      follicles. Following a 3-day BrdU pulse on d26-28 at the onset of
      anagen in both wild-type and KO skin grafts, and a 4-week chase
      when follicles had entered telogen, label retaining cells (LRCs)
      concentrated in the infrequently dividing bulge stem cells of
      wild-type follicles, but LRCs were diminished in Lhx2 KO skin.
      FIG. 1C shows increased BrdU incorporation by KO follicle stem
      cells. Following a 4-hour BrdU pulse at d40, when wild-type and KO
      follicles were in mid-anagen of their first postnatal hair cycle,
      cells were isolated and [alpha]6-integrin expressing S-phase cells
      were quantified by flow cytometry.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] FIG. 2 shows the normal program of hair development.<br>
      <br>
      <b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0007] It has now been found that Lhx2 is a transcription factor
      positioned downstream of signals necessary to specify hair
      follicle stem cells, but upstream from signals required to drive
      activated stem cells to terminally differentiate. Using gain and
      loss of function studies, Lhx2 was found to maintain the growth
      and undifferentiated properties of hair follicle progenitors.
      Accordingly, the present invention relates to the use of Lhx2 as a
      target for modulating hair growth. For example, by increasing the
      expression or activity of Lhx2, hair follicles can be maintained
      in a resting or quiescent state thereby preventing or reducing
      unwanted hair growth, whereas decreasing the expression or
      activity of Lhx2 can be employed in the stimulation or activation
      of follicle stem cell proliferation and therefore stimulation of
      hair growth. Thus, the present invention also embraces screening
      assays for identifying agents which modulate the expression or
      activity of Lhx2. Such agents can be identified in in vitro or in
      vivo screening assays which monitor the activity or expression of
      Lhx2 (e.g., via reporter protein expression). Agents which can be
      screened in accordance with the instant assays include the Lhx2
      protein or fragments thereof, as well as agonistic or antagonistic
      anti-Lhx2 antibodies. Ribozymes, siRNA, antisense oligonucleotides
      and the like can be screened for inhibiting the expression of Lhx2
      and small organic molecules can be identified which inhibit or
      stimulate the expression or activity of Lhx2.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] Embryonic hair progenitors were isolated using mice doubly
      transgenic for a Keratin 14-GFP gene expressed in skin
      keratinocytes and the Wnt reporter gene TOPGAL, transcribed in
      hair placodes and germs where [beta]-catenin/Lef1 complexes are
      active (DasGupta and Fuchs (1999) supra; Vaezi, et al. (2002) Dev.
      Cell 3:367). In these early hair progenitors, E-cadherin is
      down-regulated and P-cadherin is upregulated (Jamora, et al.
      (2003) supra). By embryonic day 17 (E17), dispase was used to
      separate the epidermis, including hair placodes and germs, from
      the underlying dermis, which harbored more mature hair pegs and
      follicles. Using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) on the
      epidermal fraction, the early "PCAD+" hair progenitors (K14-GFP+,
      [alpha]6-integrin+, P-cadherin+) were then separated from the
      "PCAD-" interfollicular epidermis (K14-GFP+, [alpha]6-integrin+,
      P-cadherin-) based on their differential surface P-cadherin
      expression. Characterization of these two cell populations
      confirmed their similarities in K5 and [beta]4-integrin
      expression, but their distinct activities of TOPGAL and expression
      of known hair placode markers.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] The gene expression profiles of purified PCAD+ hair
      progenitors and PCAD- interfollicular basal keratinocytes were
      further analyzed using oligonucleotide microarrays. Utilizing fold
      differences of known hair placode markers as a sensitivity gauge,
      a 2-fold cut-off was assigned as a genuine difference between the
      two populations. A total of 1394 probes (660 in PCAD+; 734 in
      PCAD-) were preferentially expressed greater than 2-fold in one
      population over the other (Table 1). The Mean Log2 Ratio of Table
      1 was calculated for PCAD+ with respect to PCAD- signal values.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] A short list of differentially expressed genes relevant to
      the present study is provided in Table 2. Genes designated with
      "#" were upregulated and genes designated with "*" were
      downregulated within the bulge stem cells of postnatal hair
      follicles compared against the total skin epithelial cell
      population (Blanpain, et al. (2004) Cell 118:6). A number of these
      genes have documented roles in either hair morphogenesis (PCAD+)
      or epidermal differentiation (PCAD-). The interfollicular
      epidermal population was typified by adhesive and cytoskeletal
      components, Notch signaling factors, C-myc, Kruppel-like factors,
      as well as Bmp-responsive transcription factors (Grainyhead-like,
      Ovol) previously implicated in epidermal differentiation (Fuchs
      and Raghavan (2002) Nature Rev. Genet. 3:199; Tao, et al. (2005)
      Development 132:1021; Ting, et al. (2005) Science 308:411; Arnold
      and Watt (2001) Curr. Biol. 11:558). In contrast, the hair germ
      signature featured Wnts, Shh, Bmps, Tgf[beta]s, and tyrosine
      kinase receptor signaling morphogens, as well as a number of
      different transcription factors. Although some of these
      transcription factors have not been previously implicated in the
      specification of skin progenitor fates, others have previously
      been associated with postnatal genetic hair disorders, including
      Cutl1, Gli1, Hoxc13, Sox9, Trps1, and Vdr (Millar (2002) supra;
      Schmidt-Ullrich, et al. (2005) supra).<br>
      <br>
      [0011] Unexpectedly, several of the uncharacterized transcription
      factors on this list were also found to be differentially
      expressed in the postnatal hair follicle bulge (Blanpain, et al.
      (2004) supra; Morris, et al. (2004) Nature Biotechnol. 22:411)
      (Table 2), indicating that the embryonic hair germ may exhibit
      functional properties similar to adult stem cells. Although the
      hair germ is committed to a follicular cell fate, it remains
      undifferentiated like bulge stem cells, yet capable of
      differentiating into all the lineages of the hair follicle,
      including the sebaceous gland (Ito, et al. (2005) Nature Med.
      11:1351; Levy, et al. Dev. Cell 9:855).<br>
      <br>
      [0012] To determine whether the early hair germs may reflect hair
      follicle stem cells and regulate key steps in progenitor cell
      differentiation, focus was placed on the transcription factors
      emanating from the screen that were known to govern developmental
      cell fate specification in other tissues and organs.
      Lim-homeodomain transcription factor Lhx2 was of interest since
      Lhx2 null mutant animals display defects in patterning and cell
      fate determination during brain development (Porter, et al. (1997)
      Development 124:2935; Bulchand, et al. (2001) Mech. Dev. 100:165;
      Hirota and Mombaerts (2004) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 101:8751).
      In addition, they lack definitive erythropoeisis and conversely,
      hematopoetic progenitor cells can be maintained in vitro by forced
      expression of Lhx2 (Pinto do, et al. (2002) Blood 99:3939). Lhx2
      null animals die between E15.5-E16.5, and a possible role for Lhx2
      in skin has not been examined.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] Lhx2 was upregulated 18-fold in the PCAD+ population
      relative to PCAD- population by microarray. Semi-quantitative
      RT-PCR and in situ hybridization confirmed this marked
      differential expression. By immunofluorescence, Lhx2 first
      appeared in early hair placodes, and as morphogenesis progressed,
      became prominent at the leading front of invaginating hair germs
      and pegs. As down-growth neared completion and hair
      differentiation began, Lhx2 concentrated in the upper outer root
      sheath (ORS) at a presumptive site (bulge) of the developing
      postnatal follicle stem cell compartment. Concomitantly,
      expression diminished at the base of the follicle, where highly
      proliferative matrix cells give rise to the differentiating inner
      root sheath and hair shaft. In adult follicles, Lhx2 concentrated
      in the bulge, and as the new hair cycle initiated, Lhx2 extended
      to the emerging secondary hair germs. Based upon these patterns,
      Lhx2 appeared to function in specifying the embryonic hair
      follicle progenitor cells that then persist as bulge stem cells in
      adult follicles.<br>
      <br>
      [0014] To more precisely define Lhx2's role in hair follicle stem
      cell specification and/or maintenance, its status was examined in
      various genetic mutant embryos defective in different aspects of
      hair morphogenesis. In the complete absence of hair follicle
      induction or bulge maintenance, as reflected in [beta]-catenin
      conditionally null (cKO) skin, Lhx2 was not expressed. In Shh
      knockout embryos, where hair germs are specified but unable to
      progress, Lhx2 expression was dramatically reduced. This
      positioned Lhx2 downstream of Wnt and Shh, where it could play a
      role in establishing or expanding the early progenitors necessary
      for hair follicle morphogenesis.<br>
      <br>
      [0015] Bmp signaling is not required for hair follicle induction,
      even though Bmp ligands and receptors are expressed in embryonic
      hair germs and in postnatal follicle stem cells. Correspondingly,
      in BmpR1a cKO skin, Lhx2 was expressed in both embryonic hair
      germs and the presumptive bulge of developing follicles.
      Conversely, Bmp signaling is required for differentiation, and in
      the absence of BmpR1a, proliferating undifferentiated hair
      progenitor cells accumulate at the follicle base (Andl, et al.
      (2004) Development 131:2257; Kobielak, et al. (2003) J. Cell Biol.
      163:609). Lhx2 was noticeably enhanced in these follicles, with
      strong staining throughout the ORS and matrix. These cells were
      also positive for Shh and Lef1. Thus, in the absence of terminal
      hair differentiation, cells accumulating in postnatal BmpR1a null
      follicles resembled early embryonic hair follicle progenitors.<br>
      <br>
      [0016] If Lhx2 governs the gene expression program of
      undifferentiated follicle stem cells or their early progenitors,
      then misexpression of Lhx2 in interfollicular epidermis might
      result in an induction of hair follicle progenitor genes.
      Accordingly, K14-Lhx2 transgenic mice were generated to examine
      this possibility. Although more hair follicles were not induced,
      Lhx2 markedly suppressed morphological and biochemical signs of
      epidermal differentiation and failed to produce a functional lipid
      barrier. Most notable was the induction of Tcf3 and Sox9, two key
      transcription factors of adult hair follicle stem cells (Merrill,
      et al. (2001) Genes Dev. 15:1688; Vidal, et al. (2005) Curr. Biol.
      15:1340). Lhx2 also suppressed differentiation in tongue
      epithelium. These findings indicate that Lhx2 can maintain cells
      in an undifferentiated state, further enforcing the link between
      Lhx2 and stemness.<br>
      <br>
      [0017] If Lhx2 is required for follicle stem cell maintenance,
      then its absence could alter the ability of hair follicles to
      form. In support of this notion, E16 Lhx2 null embryos displayed
      an -40% reduction in overall density of P-cadherin positive hair
      follicles, with no noticeable defect in the epidermis or embryo
      size. Marked reduction in follicle density is a feature of other
      mouse mutants in key hair follicle morphogenetic genes. Although
      Lhx2 KO follicle density was reduced, Shh, Wnt10b, Bmp2, Bmp4 and
      Lef1 expression appeared unaffected in those hair placodes and
      germs that developed. In Lhx2 null skin engraftments, follicles
      appeared morphologically and biochemically indistinguishable from
      their wild-type counterparts. Taken together, the gain and loss of
      function studies indicate that Lhx2, reflecting its expression
      pattern, functions to specify and maintain hair follicle stem
      cells, but does not function in their differentiation.<br>
      <br>
      [0018] If Lhx2 maintains the undifferentiated state of embryonic
      and adult follicle stem cells, then Lhx2 null follicles might
      exhibit alterations in the transition of stem cells from the
      resting (telogen) to the growing (anagen) phase of the postnatal
      hair cycle. Using skin grafts, the hair cycles of wild-type and
      Lhx2 KO follicles were compared. The initial morphogenetic and
      first postnatal Lhx2 KO hair cycles progressed similarly to
      wild-type and by 8 weeks, KO follicles had returned to telogen. By
      contrast, at 11 weeks when most wild-type follicles were still in
      this extended telogen, KO follicles had precociously entered the
      next hair cycle. Moreover, upon shaving at 8 weeks, most wild-type
      hairs remained in telogen while KO hairs consistently and
      uniformly grew back within 3 weeks, confirming their shortened
      resting phase.<br>
      <br>
      [0019] Immunofluorescence and FACS analyses revealed that KO
      follicles exhibited diminished CD34, a surface marker of bulge
      stem cells (FIG. 1A) (Blanpain, et al. (2004) supra). This
      reduction in CD34 was observed irrespective of hair cycle number
      or stage. Other stem cell markers examined (i.e., Tenascin C and
      S100A6) were comparably expressed in wild-type and KO bulges.<br>
      <br>
      [0020] Although CD34 marks adult stem cells, it is not found in
      embryonic skin progenitors, suggesting that its reduction could be
      an indication of enhanced proliferative activity within KO
      follicle stem cells. This was supported by bromodeoxyuridine
      (BrdU) pulse-chase experiments conducted prior to marked
      deviations in hair cycling (FIG. 1B). Only the wild-type follicle
      bulge compartment retained appreciable BrdU label administered at
      the onset of anagen and chased for 4 weeks (Blanpain, et al.
      (2004) supra; Taylor, et al. (2000) Cell 102:451). By contrast, KO
      hair follicles displayed very few label retaining cells (LRCs),
      confirmed and quantified by flow cytometry.<br>
      <br>
      [0021] The reduction in label retention was accompanied by
      enhanced proliferation within the KO bulge. After a 4-hour BrdU
      pulse during full anagen, the percentage of S-phase labeled bulge
      cells was 2* higher than normal (FIG. 1C). By contrast, the number
      of S-phase cells in the interfollicular/ORS of wild-type and KO
      skins was comparable, underscoring the specificity of this
      hyperproliferation. The elevated proliferative activity of the KO
      bulge did not appear to alter the overall size of the stem cell
      niche. It was concluded that without Lhx2, follicle stem cells are
      more readily activated to proliferate and differentiate along the
      hair lineage. On the other hand, Lhx2 is not sufficient to induce
      quiescence as transgenic expression did not suppress proliferation
      or induce CD34 in the skin epithelium.<br>
      <br>
      [0022] By isolating and transcriptionally profiling embryonic hair
      placodes and interfollicular epidermis, genes implicated in hair
      development have been identified (Table 1) and novel differences
      have been uncovered that could be important in orchestrating
      lineage specification of multipotent skin progenitors. By way of
      illustration, Lhx2 studies revealed that it functions as a
      molecular brake in regulating the switch between hair follicle
      stem cell maintenance and activation. Although follicles can be
      specified embryonically without Lhx2, their overall numbers are
      reduced, and Lhx2 null follicles that do form are not proficient
      in maintaining the resting state and precociously activate. Once
      committed, cells no longer require or express Lhx2 and progress
      along a normal program of terminal differentiation.<br>
      <br>
      [0023] Finally, Lhx2 is the first identified marker expressed
      specifically by both embryonic hair placodes and postnatal
      follicle stem cells of the bulge. Lhx2 now provides a segue to
      dissect the transcriptional mechanisms that underlie stem cell
      maintenance within the hair follicle and also serves as a target
      for modulating hair growth. Further, one or more of the genes
      identified as being involved in embryonic hair placodes and
      interfollicular epidermis (Table 1) can be used as a signature of
      the early hair germ that makes a follicle. Moreover, as with Lhx2,
      it is contemplated that one of more of the genes listed in Table 1
      can be used as targets for modulating hair growth.<br>

      </b><b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The Wnt/ß-catenin pathway is a potential target for development of
      anabolic agents to treat osteoporosis because of its role in
      osteoblast differentiation and bone formation. However, there is
      no clinically available anti-osteoporosis drug that targets this
      Wnt/ß-catenin pathway. In this study, we screened a library of
      aqueous extracts of 350 plants and identified Hovenia dulcis Thunb
      (HDT) extract as a Wnt/ß-catenin pathway activator. HDT extract
      induced osteogenic differentiation of calvarial osteoblasts
      without cytotoxicity. In addition, HDT extract increased femoral
      bone mass without inducing significant weight changes in normal
      mice. In addition, thickness and area of femoral cortical bone
      were also significantly increased by the HDT extract. Methyl
      vanillate (MV), one of the ingredients in HDT, also activated the
      Wnt/ß-catenin pathway and induced osteoblast differentiation in
      vitro. MV rescued trabecular or cortical femoral bone loss in the
      ovariectomized mice without inducing any significant weight
      changes or abnormality in liver tissue when administrated orally.
      Thus, natural HDT extract and its ingredient MV are potential
      anabolic agents for treating osteoporosis.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Introduction</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      ...Natural products such as plant extracts and their individual
      ingredients have been used traditionally to treat various diseases
      including obesity and inflammation in eastern Asia and western
      Africa [20], [21]. These natural products are regarded as
      relatively safe for drug development and are increasingly being
      used in medicines. The global market of medicinal plants was
      estimated at approximately 83 billion US dollars in 2008, and the
      World Health Organization reports that over 80% of the world's
      population use natural products for medicinal treatment of primary
      health care needs [22], [23]. This resource, however, has not been
      fully exploited and many more natural products remain to be
      identified.<br>
      <br>
      In this study, we searched plant extracts that activate
      Wnt/ß-catenin signaling pathway and induce osteoblast
      differentiation. Through the screening of plant extracts library,
      we identified an extract from Hovenia Dulcis Thunb (HDT) as an
      activator of the Wnt/ß-catenin pathway, and characterized its
      ability to modulate osteoblast differentiation and bone mass in
      vitro and in vivo, respectively. We determined that methyl
      vanillate (MV), an ingredient of HDT, activates the Wnt/ß-catenin
      pathway and is involved in osteoblast differentiation. The
      non-toxic concentration of MV rescued femoral bone loss in
      ovariectomized mice after oral administration, and the effect was
      equivalent to that of intraperitoneal PTH (1–34) injection. HDT
      extract and the small molecule MV have potential for development
      as anabolic agents to treat osteoporosis.<br>
