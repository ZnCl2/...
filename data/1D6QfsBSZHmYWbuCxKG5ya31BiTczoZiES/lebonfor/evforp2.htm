      <p>The first part of this work was devoted to the development of
        the theories deduced from my earlier experiments. This second
        part will be especially experimental. My observations of the
        dissociation of matter led me into very varied researches.
        Notwithstanding their fragmentary nature, they may, I think,
        interest the reader; and the account of them will be given in
        such a way as not to interfere with the general plan of this
        work. </p>
      <p><b>1. The Part Played by Electricity in the Transformation of
          Chemical Compounds</b> </p>
      <p>The laws of physical phenomena may be determined, but as we are
        ignorant of their underlying causes, their interpretation
        necessarily varies. If the facts do not change, the explanation
        of them is frequently modified. A great theory once accepted is
        immediately applied to the interpretation of known facts. The
        doctrine of the conservation of energy has for 50 years seemed
        able to furnish the key to all phenomena. It is now the theory
        of electrons for which this role appears to be reserved. By
        reason of the importance now given to the prevailing ideas on
        the atomic structure of electricity, it may be interesting to
        point out their genesis. </p>
      <p>Now dogmas are spontaneous only in appearance. Those who are
        attracted by a new belief especially appreciate its novelty,
        while it is in reality very old. Its history, generally
        forgotten by the textbooks, shows how certain ideas grow up and
        the slow progress of their evolution. </p>
      <p>It is to the illustrious Davy, about the beginning of the last
        century, that the origin of the present ideas on electrical
        dissociation, now termed ionization, goes back. Having passes a
        current through a solution of potash, and having noticed that
        the potassium went to one of the poles and the oxygen to the
        other, he concluded, rightly but much in advance of his time,
        that the two elements of a compound are charged with different
        electricities, which are neutralized by combination. The
        affinity which draws together and associates the elements of
        bodies must have its origin in the attraction of contrary
        electricities. We do not state the matter otherwise at the
        present day. </p>
      <p>It was on the hypothesis of Davy that Berzelius founded the
        dualistic theory which governed chemistry for 30 years. The
        compounds called binary, such as acids and oxides, were formed
        from an electro-negative united to an electro-positive element
        by the attraction of their contrary electricities. The compounds
        called tertiary -- that is to say, salts -- came from the
        combination of an electro-positive base and an electro-negative
        acid. </p>
      <p>The dualistic theory vanished when Dumas. Laurent, and Gerhard
        discovered the phenomenon of substitutions, and showed that in a
        compound an electronegative element could be replaced by an
        electropositive without sensibly changing its properties.
        Trichloroacetic acid, for example, is acetic acid in which three
        atoms of chlorine (an electronegative element) have replaced
        three atoms of hydrogen (an electropositive one). The
        conceptions of Davy and Berzelius, correct as they were, were
        abandoned for a long period. </p>
      <p>Their readoption was the consequences of the researches of the
        illustrious Faraday. Towards 1830, he discovered the laws of
        electrolysis, and measured the electric charges given up by
        bodies at the poles of the battery when they are decomposed by
        the electric current. He noted that when an electric current is
        passed through the solution of a salt, the latter is decomposed
        into two elements charged with contrary electricities, which are
        found at the two poles. This operation, the result of which is
        to resolve compound bodies into their elements, is called, as we
        know, electrolysis. The bodies capable of undergoing such an
        operation are called electrolytes. The products of the
        decomposition constitute ions. Simple bodies, considered as such
        to be indecomposable, evidently could not be electrolytes and
        consequently produce ions. This last was a fundamental point. </p>
      <p>After having verified the enormous charge of electricity --
        96,000 coulombs for a gram of hydrogen electrolysis and the
        equality of this charge for all bodies of equal atomic weight,
        Faraday recognized, thus confirming the idea of Davy and
        Berzelius, that chemical phenomena are only electrical phenomena
        -- that is to say, displacements of electricity. </p>
      <p>"The numbers representing the equivalent weights of bodies", he
        says, "represent simply the quantities of electricity. The
        electricity determines the equivalent number because it
        determines the forces of combination. By adopting the atomic
        theory, we say that the atoms of bodies equivalent to one
        another in their chemical combination bear the same charges of
        electricity. It is the quantity of electricity associated with
        the different atoms which constitutes electrical affinity". The
        most recent ideas simply represent the adoption and extension of
        Faraday’s views. At the present day, the theory of ionization
        reigns without a rival. It has given birth to a new chemical
        nomenclature in which the properties of bodies are expressed as
        a function of their electric charges, and no longer, as
        Berthelot wished, as a function of their thermal properties. </p>
      <p>Thermochemistry is now looked upon almost as a doctrine in
        course of disappearance. We now consider the study of the
        electrical reactions of bodies as far more important than that
        of their thermal relation. Charges of electricity and the manner
        in which they are distributed generate all the properties of
        bodies and the reactions which their combinations exhibit. </p>
      <p>The actual theory of ionization may be summed up in the
        following statement, which does but repeat exactly the ideas of
        Faraday: Bodies are composed of elements or ions charges, some
        with positive, others with negative electricity, and united at
        first in the neutral state. Under the influence of the battery
        current, the neutral molecule dissociates into positive and
        negative elements, which go to the poles of contrary names. The
        decomposition of a neutral salt may be represented by such an
        equation as the following: NO<sub>3</sub>K = NO<sup>-3</sup> +
        K+. </p>
      <p>When an ion leaves a solution in order to precipitate itself at
        an electrode charged with electricity of contrary sign -- by
        reason of the attraction exercised between two opposite electric
        charges -- it then receives from the electrode a charge exactly
        equal but of contrary sign to that which it before possessed. To
        ascertain this quantity -- to know, for example, the electric
        charge of the atoms of 1 gram of hydrogen -- we need only
        measure with suitable instruments the expenditure of electricity
        necessary to neutralize the ions set at liberty. </p>
      <p>At the period of the history of ionization just briefly
        sketched, it was admitted that the dissociation of the elements
        of bodies into ions charged with electricity could only be
        effected under the influence of an electric current, but soon we
        had to go much further. </p>
      <p>Adopting the theoretical ideas put forward by Clausius,
        Arrhenius recognized that an electric current was in no way
        necessary to produce the dissociation of compounds into ions. In
        dilute solutions, the bodies dissolved must be separated into
        ions by the mere fact of solution. When the electrodes of a
        battery are plunged into such a solution, the ions must simply
        be attracted by them -- the positive ions by the negative pole,
        and the negative ions by the positive pole. </p>
      <p>According to this theory, which is evidently very hypothetical,
        but which has been admitted because it much facilitates
        explanations, the dilute solution of a metallic salt would
        contain something quite other than the salt itself. A dilute
        solution of sea salt, for example, would in no way contain the
        chloride of sodium we are acquainted with. It would contain
        chlorine atoms and sodium atoms in a free state. </p>
      <p>This chlorine and this sodium in the state of ions must differ
        much from the substances generally known by those names, since
        the sodium of our laboratories cannot be introduced into water
        without decomposing it. The difference must be due to the fact
        that in the ion chlorine and the ion sodium the electricities
        are separated, while in the substances known by the same names
        they are neutralized. </p>
      <p>All these theories and the experiments whence they are derived
        show us that electricity is every day more and more considered
        as the essential factor in the properties of bodies. It must be
        solely from their electrical charge that these properties are
        derived. The chemical activity of an acid and of a base must be
        the simple consequence of the proportion of ions they contain. A
        strong acid such as sulfuric acid must contain a great number of
        free ions, and a feeble one like acetic acid very few. Chemical
        reactions are now more and more regarded as simple reactions of
        ions. Atomicity or valency -- that is to say, the aptitude of
        atoms to unite with a greater or less number of other atoms of
        various bodies -- must depend on their capacity for saturation
        with electricity. It is thus, for example. That in a salt like
        chloride of zinc (ZnCl<sub>2</sub>) the atom zinc, by reason of
        the greatness of its positive charge, can hold in equilibrium
        two negative ions of chlorine. </p>
      <p>Such is the current theory. It is very probable that things
        happen in a less simple, perhaps even in a very different
        manner; but when an explanation fits in fairly well with known
        facts, it is wise to be satisfied with it. </p>
      <p>The theory of electrons, according to which the electric fluid
        is composed of an aggregate of particles of definite magnitude,
        is a direct consequence of the preceding views, and could only
        give them further precision. This theory, which goes back to
        Helmholtz, and has been developed by Lorentz, also explains
        chemical compounds and decompositions by the aptitude of atoms
        for acquiring and losing electrons. Their degree of valency
        would thus depend on the number of electrons they might lose or
        capture. Those which, like the atoms of helium or of argon, must
        be too stable to acquire or lose any, would be unable to form
        any combination. All chemical forces would have an electrical
        origin. Affinity would recognize no other cause. His, again, is
        exactly what Faraday said and Davy maintained. </p>
      <p><b>2. The Part Played by Electricity in the Dissociation of
          Simple Bodies</b> </p>
      <p>The idea that we might separate particles of electricity from
        their material support was not imaginable before the recent
        discoveries. It was even so contrary to the early experiments,
        which seem to show that electricity could not be transported
        without material support, that for a long time the cathode rays
        were considered to be formed by the projection of material
        particles. </p>
      <p>This separation of a charge of electricity from its support
        seemed impossible. Still more impossible did it appear that a
        simple body could be subjected to ionization -- that is to say,
        to a separation of elements such as has just been described
        above. A simple body, being by definition incapable of
        decomposition, evidently could not be dissociated. To separate
        the chlorine from the potassium in chloride of potassium was
        easy; but how could we suppose it possible to extract from
        chlorine something which was not chlorine and from potassium
        anything other than potassium. </p>
      <p>In less than 10 years, however, that which was considered
        impossible has ceased to be so. The study of the cathode rays,
        or of the conductivity of gases, of radioactive emissions, and,
        finally, my demonstration of the universality of the
        dissociation of matter, have proved that from simple bodies
        something quite different from them can be extracted. This
        something, identical in the most various subjects, being endowed
        with electrical properties, we will consider as constituted of
        those particles to which the name of electrons has been given. </p>
      <p>Whatever this interpretation be worth, it was certain that
        simple bodies could also be dissociated; but as this was an idea
        directly contrary to the doctrines then ruling, and as it was
        nevertheless necessary to find some theory to explain the
        observed facts, the old doctrine of ionization was adopted. It
        was therefore admitted that the electrified particles observed
        in gases or in dissociated simple bodies were the result of
        their ionization. The expression, having been accepted long
        since, could shock no one, while the idea of the dissociation of
        a simple body would have seemed disquieting. Yet the two words
        signify exactly the same thing. When we look only at the facts,
        it is evident that when from the atoms of a simple body
        something quite different from it has been taken, the atoms of
        which it is composed have necessarily been dissociated. </p>
      <p>It is, moreover, this conclusion which, after many hesitations,
        has finally been reached. It was the study of radium which
        carried conviction with it. This body presents in an eminent
        degree properties which all bodies possess in a very slight
        degree. It emits in abundance the products of the dissociation
        of its atoms. By studying these products I recognized their
        analogy, first with the emissions of particles in Crooke’s
        tubes, and then with the effluves emitted by all bodies under
        the action of light or of various influences. Finally, it had to
        be acknowledged that the dissociation of matter is, as I long
        ago proved, a universal phenomenon. </p>
      <p>All these experiments, many of which showed us particles of
        electricity freed from their material support, have naturally
        given great force to the theory of atomic electricity, otherwise
        called the electronic theory. Having sufficiently set out this
        in my former work, it would be useless to go back to it here. No
        objection can be taken to it when it is confined to regarding
        electricity as composed of discontinuous particles; but there
        does not seem to be any necessity whatever for considering
        matter as composed of electrons. Electricity is, like heat and
        the other forces, one of the forms of intra-atomic energy. From
        all matter we can extract electricity and heat; but there is no
        more reason to say that matter is composed of particles of
        electricity than to assert that it is composed of particles of
        heat. </p>
      <p>It would be as useless, however, to combat the electronic
        theory at the present day, as it was in Newton’s time to contest
        the emission hypothesis in optics. Those who attempted it were
        not even listened to, although the future has shown how right
        they were. I shall therefore not try to dispute its worth. This
        task is the less necessary, that it is very easy to express the
        phenomena in current language. I shall therefore continue to use
        it for clearness of demonstration. </p>
      <p>"The electron", Poincare says rightly, "has conquered physics,
        and many adore the new idol rather blindly". The idol, in
        reality of long standing, has only changed its name. To attempt
        to reduce matter to a single element is indeed an old idea. It
        translates into fact a mental aspiration and a craving for
        simplicity with which nature is doubtless not acquainted. One
        ought not to speak evil of such cravings, for they are the
        begetters of effort. Thus provisional doctrines and beneficient
        chimeras stimulate our labors. We unceasingly pursue the
        Sisyphus task of explanation, but always with the hope that it
        is for the last time. </p>

        <b><font size="+1">The Transformation of Matter into Electricity</font></b></center>
      <p><b>1. Transformation of Matter into Electricity</b> </p>
      <p>Several chapters of my last work were devoted to showing how
        matter can, by dissociation, return to the ether by a series of
        successive stages. Among the most constant products of this
        dissociation electricity is found. It is one of the important
        manifestations of that liberation of intra-atomic energy which
        always accompanies the dematerialization of matter. </p>
      <p>Since electricity in motion represents energy, it may be said
        that the transformation of a body into electricity realizes a
        change of matter into energy. Such a phenomenon being absolutely
        contrary t the fundamental principles of modern science, my
        theory will not be acceptable until after a radical conversion
        of current ideas. It will not therefore be useless to return to
        so important a subject, and to add new experimental proofs in
        support of those already set forth. It is equally necessary to
        show that this doctrine gives the key to phenomena for which
        either the most insufficient explanations or no explanations at
        all have hitherto been furnished. </p>
      <p><b>2. Electrification by Influence</b> </p>
      <p>Electrification by influence, by virtue of which a tick of
        sealing wax which has been rubbed attracts light bodies such as
        a suspended ball of pitch, is the most simple of electrical
        phenomena, and the earliest observed. The usual explanation
        given of it is too well known for it to be necessary to
        reproduce it here. It is, moreover, the same as that of the
        phenomena of the same order which we shall shortly have to deal
        with, when showing how unacceptable is the classic theory. </p>
      <p>This experiment of the attraction of light bodies is in reality
        one of the most remarkable in physics, and it would have only
        been necessary to observe it attentively in order to discover
        the proof of the dissociation of matter and of the existence of
        intra-atomic energy -- that is to say, of two important
        principles of modern science. </p>
      <p>In the old theories, the various experiments in electricity by
        influence implied this very singular consequence, that with the
        limited quantity of electricity existing on a body, we could
        extract from another body an unlimited quantity of electricity.
      </p>
      <p>Let me recall, to put this essential point clearly in evidence,
        the classic experiment demonstrating electrification by
        influence. </p>
      <p>A metallic sphere (Figure 1) placed on an insulated support is
        electrified in one way or another, and thus receives a definite
        quantity of electricity, the magnitude of which is easily
        measurable. Let us being near to this sphere at a little
        distance a conductor -- for example, a long cylinder of metal B,
        C, placed on an insulator D. We immediately recognize by the
        ordinary means that the cylinder is charged with electricity. If
        the ball has in the first instance received positive
        electricity, it will be observed that the part of the cylinder
        next to it is charged with negative and its other extremity with
        positive electricity. If, then, this latter is touched so as to
        connect it with the earth, the whole cylinder remains charged
        with negative electricity. This may now be transferred to some
        other body by moving the cylinder by its insulated support. </p>
      <p><b>Figure 1</b> </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="1fig1.jpg" height="218" width="332"></p>
      </center>
      <p>After having discharged the cylinder we have only, in order to
        recharge it, to bring it again near the ball and act as before.
        As these successive operations -- charge and discharge of the
        cylinder -- can be repeated an unlimited number of times, it
        necessarily follows that, with the limited charge of electricity
        on an electrified ball, there can be generated on another body
        an unlimited quantity of electricity. </p>
      <p>Physicists, moreover, recognize this clearly. Jamin says in his
        <i>Cours de Physique de l’Ecole Poklytechnique</i> (4th ed., vol
        4, p. 187): "Influence enables us to obtain, by means of a
        limited quantity of positive electricity an indefinite quantity
        of negative electricity". We explain this apparent creation of
        energy by saying that, to charge a body several times by
        influence it must be displaced -- that is to say, an amount of
        work must be expended representing the equivalent of the
        electricity generated at each new operation. </p>
      <p>Feeble as is this explanation of the transformation into
        electricity of the simple movement of translation of a body, it
        seemed useful to take away every appearance of probability form
        it by producing an indefinitely extended electrification without
        any trace of displacement of the body electrified. This is
        realized in the following experiment, which shows a body
        isolated in space becoming by influence, a continuous source of
        electricity. </p>
      <p><b>Figure 2</b> </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="1fig2.jpg" height="803" width="196"></p>
      </center>
      <p>A (Figure 2) is the influencing electrified body. It is kept
        charged with positive electricity by any means we please (1).
        Below we see a piece of aluminum or gold leaf half a centimeter
        wide and two centimeters high. B is a metal rod placed on a
        table or held in the hand. After a few trials a position is
        easily found in which the strip of metal remains wholly and
        indefinitely motionless in space. In spite of its slight
        consistence it remains fixed and rigid as if held by springs,
        and its point throws out little sparks visible in the dark. Its
        various parts take charges, the direction of which is shown in
        the figure. </p>
      <p>[(1) If the ball is charged with negative instead of positive
        electricity, the aluminum leaf will attach itself to it and will
        not remain motionless in space.] </p>
      <p>This experiment has always impressed those physicists to whom I
        have shown it, because the equilibrium observed is difficult of
        explanation. It must not be supposed that the metal arrow is
        simply immobilized by the electric attractions exercised in
        contrary direction on its extremities. It would be impossible to
        maintain in a block of iron between the poles of magnets acting
        on it in opposite directions. It is only in oriental legends
        that we see Mahomet’s coffin immobilized in space by the action
        of magnets placed in its neighborhood. </p>
      <p>The aluminum arrow in the above experiment only remains
        motionless because it is the seat of a constant emission of
        particles. It is, moreover, not a question of equilibrium we
        have to examine here, but the continuous emission of electricity
        by he metal under the influence of the electrified ball. This
        omission is made plain by the little sparks, easily seen in the
        dark, which issue from the point of the metal. </p>
      <p>In the experiment thus arranged, the electricity produced can
        only issue from the elements composing the strip of aluminum.
        How can we explain the fact that from an isolated fragment of
        metal we can extract an apparently infinite quantity of
        electricity? </p>
      <p>Readers conversant with my previous researches will certainly
        have guessed the explanation. It is wholly contained in the
        enunciation of the three following principles: (1) Matter
        contains an enormous reservoir of energy; (2) it can be
        dissociated; (3) in dissociation it liberates, in various forms,
        but especially as electricity, a part of the intra-atomic energy
        accumulated within it at the moment of its formation. </p>
      <p>The metal arrow in the preceding experiment is in every way
        comparable to a fragment of radium. The only difference is that,
        instead of dissociating itself spontaneously like the radium,
        the fragment of aluminum is only dematerialized under the
        influence of electric action. </p>
      <p>When we rub a body, when we place it under the influence of an
        electrified source, or when we subject it to any sort of
        disturbance of the ether, such as a luminous ray, we are doing
        quite a different thing to transforming (as the textbooks teach)
        movement or any other energy into electricity. We do not thus
        affect a transformation, but a liberation of force. We simply
        dissociate matter by bringing suitable reagents to bear upon it.
        Electricity is one of the manifestations of this dissociation. </p>
      <p>The magnitude of intra-atomic energy being, as I have shown,
        immense, it will be understood that from a very infinitesimal
        portion of matter there may issue a very large quantity of
        energy. This emission is considerable, but it is not infinite;
        and it is probable that if the above experiment were continued
        for several centuries, we should see the aluminum become
        gradually less by its conversion into electricity, and finally
        disappear. We should then have witnessed the complete
        transformation of matter into energy. </p>
      <p>The experiment on electrification by influence described in
        this chapter realizes this evolution exactly. We might have read
        it in the elementary facts which have been before the eyes of
        physicists for several centuries without their understanding
        their import. </p>
      <p>It further results from this experiment that electricity, which
        is one of the products of the dissociation of matter, is at the
        same time one of the most active agents of this dissociation. It
        constitutes by its special attractions for the elements of
        matter one of those appropriate reagents of which the importance
        has been shown in a chapter of my earlier. It is one of those
        against which matter is defenseless, while it is able to strive
        against very energetic but not appropriate reactions. </p>
      <p>The irresistible power of attraction of a minute particle of
        electricity dissociates matter which the impact of a shell might
        pulverize and even volatilize, but could not dematerialize. </p>
      <p><b>3. The Different Forms of Electric Influence</b> </p>
      <p>In the last experiment, that of the strip of aluminum
        immobilized in space, we have seen influence manifest itself by
        the projection of luminous particles, while in the classical
        experiment previously related this projection is not visibly
        produced. </p>
      <p>I was thus led to suspect that the phenomenon of
        electrification by influence might take place through different
        mechanisms. Researches made to verify this hypothesis have
        enabled me to recognize its correctness. </p>
      <p>Let us first of all note that by the theory of electrons,
        electrification by influence would obtain a very simple
        explanation, since it would be enough to admit that, from bodied
        subjected to influence there pass visible or invisible
        electrons, which are immediately transformed into ions by their
        passage in the air, according to the well-known mechanisms. </p>
      <p>M. de Heen has opposed to this interpretation a very grave
        objection: If electrification by influence were due to
        projections of particles proceeding from the influencing body,
        it would be arrested by the interposition of a thick sheet of
        glass, which is not at all the case. This is plainly seen in the
        experiments given later on, which show the action of influence
        upon a body entirely protected by three concentric metallic
        enclosures. The theory of electrons is therefore quite powerless
        to explain electrification by influence. It may result from
        somewhat different mechanisms, as shown in the following
        experiments, which prove that bodies subjected to the same
        electric influence may, according to circumstances, acquire
        charges of contrary sign. </p>
      <p>No one is aware -- for this, again, is one of the most
        elementary experiments in physics -- that if an electrified
        substance -- a stick of ebonite or glass, for instance --
        excited by friction is brought close to the ball of an
        electroscope, the leaves are charged by influence and
        immediately diverge. They fall as soon as the electrified body
        is withdrawn, because the charges of contrary sign produced on
        the ball and on the leaves recombine as soon as the influence
        ceases. </p>
      <p>Generations of physicists and their pupils have repeated this
        experiment. Had they thought of prolonging the presence of the
        rod above the ball of the electroscope for a few minutes instead
        of a few seconds, they would have observed -- not without some
        astonishment, perhaps -- that the gold leaves remain separated
        after the rod has been withdrawn, and that the sign of the
        charge of the ball has changed -- that is to say, that it has
        become negative from positive, as it was at first. The effects
        produced depend, moreover, on the form given to the body
        influenced, as shown in the subjoined figures (Figures 3 to 5).
        Here we see modes of influence succeeding, but not superposed
        on, each other. It is impossible to confuse them, for to each of
        them there corresponds a different charge of electricity. </p>
      <p><b>Figure 3 / 4 / 5</b> </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="1fig345.jpg" height="154" width="372"></p>
      </center>
      <p>In the case of Figure 5 the plate-like form of the influenced
        body is the cause that the sign of the charge does not change,
        and that the leaves fall when the electrified rod is withdrawn.
      </p>
      <p>In the case of Figures 3 and 4 it is quite otherwise; the
        leaves remain charged when we take away the rod. With the
        electroscope of Figure 4 the experiment is effected in a few
        seconds, while it is necessary to continue the presence of the
        ebonite rod for some 12minutes for it to succeed with the ball
        electroscope of Figure 3. </p>
      <p>The explanation of the maintenance of the charge or of its
        reversal after the rod of ebonite has been withdrawn is very
        simple. </p>
      <p>Take, for example, the case of Figure 3. The charge of the ball
        under the influence of the action of the negatively electrified
        ebonite rod is, as we know, at first positive, and that of the
        leaves negative. If the ball is touched with the finger, as when
        we charge an electroscope by influence, the negative charge
        passes into the earth, while the positive charge, kept back by
        the negative electricity of the rod, remains on the ball and
        flows into the leaves as soon as the finger and the electric rod
        are withdrawn. Finally, the leaves are charged positively. </p>
      <p>If the ebonite rod be left a sufficient time near the ball, we
        note, on the contrary, that when it is withdrawn without
        touching the ball of the electroscope with the finger, the
        leaves remain negatively charged instead of positively. Why? </p>
      <p>As soon as the ebonite rod is brought close to the ball of the
        electroscope it becomes positively charged by influence -- as in
        the experiment with the cylinder related in another paragraph --
        and the negative electricity is drawn into the leaves. If,
        instead of withdrawing the ebonite rod, its presence is
        prolonged, it strongly attracts the particles of positive
        electricity from the ball, and when it is withdrawn the gold
        leaves keep the negative electricity they took at first, which
        is then spread over the ball. Therefore this latter, which was
        first charged positively, now becomes charged negatively.
        Finally, the whole instrument possesses a charge of negative
        electricity. </p>
      <p>In Figure 4 this transformation of the positive charge of the
        ball into a negative charge takes place much more quickly than
        in Figure 3 by reason of the pointed form given to the rod of
        the electroscope. In Figure 5 the transformation of the sign of
        the charge does not take place at all in consequence of the
        plate-like form of the apparatus, which gives the electricity
        far too slight a density per unit of surface for it to escape. </p>
      <p>The theory of the charge of an electroscope by influence is
        exactly the same as that of the electrification by means of an
        electrified sphere placed close to a cylinder, which we
        discussed in a previous paragraph. The electrified sphere
        represents the ebonite rod, the cylinder the gold leaves and the
        ball of the electroscope to which they are fixed. </p>
      <p>But if these two instruments are the same, the theory of the
        origin of the electricity given for the one is valid for the
        other. We have seen that an electrified sphere placed in the
        vicinity of an insulated metallic cylinder dissociates the
        matter of this last and transforms it into electricity. When an
        electrified rod is brought close to the ball of an electroscope,
        the metal of this ball is likewise dissociated, and the
        electricity manifested therein is the product of this
        dissociation. </p>
      <p><b>4. Mechanism of the Leak of Electrical Charges from
          Insulating Bodies</b> </p>
      <p>Electricity is able to diffuse itself in conducting bodies by
        conduction, convection, and influence. How does its diffusion
        take place in non-conducting bodies? </p>
      <p>Maxwell’s theory is well known. According to him, electricity
        does not circulate in dielectrics because it would have to
        overcome an elastic resistance which goes on increasing, and
        soon opposes its propagation. </p>
      <p>It is true that a dielectric may for a very long time retain a
        part of its charge. I have electrified blocks of paraffin which
        at the end of 18 months retained a weak residual
        electrification. But it is evident also that dielectrics very
        quickly lose a great part of their electricity, because a rod of
        ebonite excited by friction, of which the potential may exceed
        1500 volts, loses the greater part of its charge in a few
        minutes. It is even astonishing that it should not disappear
        quicker, if we admit that the quantity of electricity retained
        by a body is kept on its surface by the pressure of the
        insulating gas and of the equally insulating ether which
        surround it. When there is no longer equilibrium between these
        antagonistic actions, the electricity partly escapes. </p>
      <p>My researches prove that this loss of electricity by an
        insulating body is effected in two ways: (1) by convection --
        that is to say, by the emission of particles; and (2) by
        conduction -- that is to say, by propagation along an
        electrified body to one of its extremities, as in the case of
        conductors. </p>
      <p>This last mode of propagation, evidently contrary to the
        reigning theories, can be put in evidence by the following
        experiment: -- </p>
      <p>Procure some rods of ebonite or of paraffin about 1 meter long.
        After having electrified them at one of their extremities by
        rubbing them for a length of only 2 centimeters, the
        unelectrified end is placed in contact with a conducting body
        connected with the ball of an electroscope. No displacement of
        the gold leaves is noticed at first, but by prolonging the
        contact for a few minutes the instrument becomes slowly changed.
        The electricity is therefore propagated along the unelectrified
        part. </p>
      <p>This experiment shows that, in reality, electricity is able to
        propagate itself in insulators as well as in conductors, but
        much more slowly in the first-named case than in the second.
        When we speak of the velocity of electricity, therefore, it must
        be said that, according to the body employed, it circulates with
        a rapidity varying from a few centimeters to 300,000 kilometers
        per second. </p>

      <p><b>5. Causes of the Differences of Tension Observed in
          Electricity Proceeding from Chemical Decompositions and from
          those Produced by Influence or Friction</b> </p>
      <p>We know that the electricity obtained by the chemical reactions
        which take place in a battery of any kind is emitted in
        quantities varying with the size of the battery, but at a
        tension independent of its dimension. Whether the battery be the
        size of a thimble or of a house, the tension is always the same
        and always very weak, since it hardly exceeds two volts per
        cell. </p>
      <p>It is quite different with electricity drawn from matter
        without the intervention of any chemical reagent -- that is to
        say, by friction or influence. The quantity of electricity then
        produced is extremely weak, but its tension extremely great. It
        may exceed 1500 volts from the friction of a simple rod of
        ebonite, and may easily attain 50,000 volts from the very
        smallest static machine used in a laboratory. In order to obtain
        the same voltage with batteries, it would be necessary -- the
        elements being added together -- to collect about 25,000 cells.
      </p>
      <p>These differences greatly impressed the old physicists, and was
        the origin of the division set up between static and dynamic
        electricity -- so-called -- which weighed down science for over
        50 years. Notwithstanding the apparent dissimilarities resulting
        from differences of tension, the electricity generated by a
        battery is identical with that produced by a static machine. The
        battery and the static machine both produce, when their poles
        are connected by a wire, an electric current surrounded by a
        magnetic field and able to deviate the needle of a galvanometer.
      </p>
      <p>A battery of which the poles are separated is in every way
        comparable to a static machine just charged, the poles of which
        are far apart. Alike between the poles of the machine and those
        of the battery, a certain difference of potential exists. When
        they are connected by a wire, the electricity flows one pole to
        the other, and it is this flow which constitutes the electric
        current. Since the electricity generated by chemical
        decomposition as in batteries, and that produced by simple
        friction in machines, do not differ, why has the electricity of
        a battery produced by chemical decompositions only a tension of
        one or two volts, while that obtained by simple friction attains
        a tension 20 or 30 thousand times as much? The textbooks are
        silent on this question. </p>
      <p>As none of the chemical decompositions known to us intervene in
        the friction or influence machine, the production of electricity
        in these latter has probably another origin than that of
        molecular reactions. It proceeds, as previously t shown, from
        the dissociation of the atoms. When electricity is drawn from a
        simple body, whether by influence or by friction, it is simply
        intra-atomic energy which is liberated. Now, as this latter
        exists in matter in a state of extreme condensation, it is not
        astonishing that electricity should go forth from it at high
        tension. It has, on the contrary, a very low potential when it
        results not from the dissociation of the atom, but from changes
        of molecular equilibria. Compared with intra-atomic energies,
        intra-molecular energies are extremely weak. </p>
      <p>I have noted in several experiments, the most important of
        which has already been mentioned above, the case with which
        intra-atomic energy transforms itself into electricity at a high
        potential. </p>
      <p>Electrification by friction has always been obtained hitherto
        by rubbing insulated bodies -- rosin, glass, etc. It is
        preferable, in order to justify the preceding thesis, to use
        conducting bodies. By employing simple bodies, such as pure
        metals, we avoid all foreign factors capable of coming in when
        such complex substances as glass or rosin are used. </p>
      <p>To easily effect the following experiments strips of various
        metals -- copper, aluminum, etc., in the form of a rectangle
        about 10 cm square -- must be firmly fixed in ebonite handles.
        If, holding the ebonite handle in one hand, the strip of metal
        be slightly rubbed with a catskin held in the other, it will be
        seen, on bringing the metal close to the electroscope, that it
        is charged with electricity of a potential from 1000 to 1500
        volts. The gold leaves sometimes stand out horizontally, and may
        even be torn. </p>
      <p>The experiment only succeeds when the atmosphere is very dry.
        If, to dry the metal, it is heated to about 100 degrees or more,
        it can no longer, after cooling, be electrified by friction
        otherwise than very slightly. It then regains the property of
        being electrified at a high potential only after a certain lapse
        of time, which varies with the metal. </p>
      <p>Temperature exercise little influence on certain metals, such
        as copper; but a great deal on others, such as aluminum. This
        latter does not regain the property of being strongly
        electrified for a quarter of an hour after having been heated. </p>
      <p>When the metal is in conditions in which it can be easily
        electrified, it suffices to pass a catskin once lightly over it
        for it to be electrified to a potential of a few hundred volts.
        It is therefore quite correct, as I have said elsewhere, that
        matter need only be touched in order to draw electricity from
        it. So rapid a transformation by so simple a means always
        appears extraordinary when one reflect upon it. It is all the
        more striking that, in electrification by the simple contact of
        two heterogeneous metals, the potential obtained is only a few
        volts -- that is to say, so feeble that it cannot be observed
        with an ordinary electroscope. Volta, who discovered
        electrification, only succeeded in demonstrating this by means
        of his condensing electroscope. </p>
      <p>If the electrification of metals by friction or by influence
        did not depend on so many very variable atmospheric conditions,
        there might be an advantage in replacing the insulating glass or
        ebonite plates of static machines by metal plates properly
        insulated. </p>
      <p>Very often in the course of this long study we have recorded
        the ease with which matter can be dissociated notwithstanding
        its apparent stability, as soon as one brings into action
        reagents to which it is sensitive. The most powerful forces seem
        to have no hold upon it; we may pulverize, calcine, and
        volatilize it without its weight being in any way altered. And
        yet it suffices to touch it lightly, to let fall on its surface
        a feeble ray of solar light, for instability to take the place
        of stability and for its disaggregation to begin. It is from
        this instability that forces are derived. Electricity, heat, and
        all the energies of the universe represent unstable forms of
        matter. </p>
      <p>What further strikes us in this study are the colossal energies
        contained in the smallest particle of matter. These energies
        play perhaps a preponderant part in biological phenomena. We
        already obtain a glimpse of this from the importance of the role
        of substances such as toxins, diastases, and colloidal bodies,
        containing only imponderable traces of matter, which is,
        however, doubtless in a form where its energies can be
        liberated. We evidently find ourselves here in the presence of a
        new world. The thorough study of which will modify all our
        present conceptions of the universe. </p>

        <b><font size="+1">The Problems of Magnetism, Magnetic
            Induction, and Lines of Force</font></b></center>
      <p><b>1. The Problem of Magnetism</b> </p>
      <p>The problem which offers itself to us in the case of
        electrification by influence likewise presents itself as regards
        the phenomena of magnetism and of magnetic induction. </p>
      <p>We know that a permanent magnet can magnetize an indefinite
        number of iron bars. A limited quantity of magnetism would
        therefore seem to produce an unlimited quantity. </p>
      <p>To say that the magnetism of a magnet only serves to orient the
        molecules of iron subjected to its action is no explanation at
        all, for, if it were so, this orientation would necessitate an
        expenditure of power which would exhaust the magnetism of the
        magnetizing body. </p>
      <p>The interpretation of magnetism being evidently difficult, we
        still keep to the old hypothesis of the particular currents of
        Ampere notwithstanding all the objectives aroused by it. That of
        Lorentz -- on which, however, he does not greatly insist -- is
        not much more satisfactory. "It may be supposed", he says, "that
        there exists in a magnet electrons which turn or whirl". </p>
      <p>Observation teaches us that there issues from a lodestone lines
        of force of which the existence and the direction are rendered
        plain by the classical experiment of the magnetic spectrum.
        Collectively they constitute what is termed the magnetic field.
      </p>
      <p>Let us keep, then, to this experimental fact, that magnetism is
        accompanied by the emission of things of unknown structure
        called lines or tubes of force. Taken together, they form a
        pencil of which the size depends on certain conditions, such as
        the section of the magnet. It would suffice, in order to explain
        the phenomena of the magnetizing of all the bars of iron
        successively introduced into the field of a magnet, if we
        admitted that its lines of force are immediately appropriated by
        the bars of iron they meet, and as immediately replaced by
        others issuing from the magnet and equal in number. </p>
      <p>But we thus only put the difficulty a stage further back. How
        can a magnet indefinitely replace the line s of force it loses
        by magnetizing another body? </p>
      <p>We can only explain this apparently infinite production by
        recurring to my theory of the dissociation of matter and of the
        liberation in immense quantities of the intra-atomic energy it
        contains. The manifestations of intra-atomic energy are
        numerous. Heat and electricity are two of them, to which must,
        no doubt, be added magnetism. </p>
      <p>A loadstone can generate an almost unlimited number of lines of
        force, exactly as a fragment of radium can generate an almost
        unlimited quantity of heat and of certain radiations. These
        radiations, again, are capable of being seized upon by
        neighboring bodies and of giving to them the properties of
        radium itself. This is the phenomenon which is termed induced
        radioactivity, and presents great analogies with the magnetism
        induced by the neighborhood of a magnetized body. </p>
      <p>I shall not dwell on the preceding interpretation, because it
        is impossible to verify its validity by experiment. </p>
      <p>Physicists, moreover, have almost renounced the attempt to
        explain the phenomena relating to magnetism. Poincare has very
        well shown in the following passage how wretched is the
        explanation generally admitted: -- </p>
      <p>"A magnet attracts a current; here, then is mechanical work
        produced, but whence does it come? There still remains to us, in
        order not to avow our embarrassment, the resource of a merely
        verbal explanation, and of saying that the work reaped comes
        from a diminution of the potential energy of the system. It is
        indeed in this fashion that the manner in which two permanent
        magnets act on one another is interpreted -- it cannot be said
        explained. </p>
      <p>"But when we see a current displacing itself under the notion
        of electromagnetic forces, and we ascertain that we can thus
        obtain continuous rotations, it seems very improbable that the
        work obtained can come in this case from a corresponding loss in
        the potential energy of the system. One must, in fact, suppose
        that this energy has, so to speak, an infinite, and this
        supposition is rather repugnant to common sense. </p>
      <p><b>2. The Problem of Induction</b> </p>
      <p>The same problem is equally present in the case of magnetic
        induction. How, with a definite quantity of magnetism, can we
        produce an apparently unlimited quantity of induced electricity?
      </p>
      <p>By cutting the lines of force of a magnet by a metallic wire
        forming a loop, of which the extremities are connected with the
        terminals of a galvanometer, we verify during the passage of the
        wire through the lines of force the appearance of a so-called
        induction current. It suffices to continuously displace the
        metallic wire in the magnetic field, so long as the
        displacements are repeated. </p>
      <p>On this fundamental fact of the production of a current by a
        conductor cutting the lines of force are based our
        magneto-electric machines, from which dynamos only differ
        because here an electromagnet takes the place of the fixed
        magnet. We will only consider here the first-named, which will
        enable me to make our demonstrations clearer. </p>
      <p>In these magneto-electric machines, the single wire referred to
        above is wound on a drum revolving between the poles of a fixed
        magnet, so as to cut again and again its lines of force. So long
        as the coil continues its movement, the magnetism of the magnet
        will be transformed into electricity. With a finite quantity of
        magnetism, we therefore produce an unlimited quantity of
        electricity. </p>
      <p>By the current theories, this indefinite generation of
        electricity at the expense of a limited quantity of magnetism is
        explained by saying that it is the rotational movement of the
        coil which is transformed with electricity, or, if you will,
        that the power expended against the electromotive forces is
        again met with under the form of electrical energy. Such a
        metamorphosis would be as marvelous, in reality, as the
        transmutation of lead into gold by simply shaking it in a
        bottle. It is very unlikely that kinetic energy should undergo
        such a transformation, and another interpretation must be sought
        for the phenomenon. </p>
      <p>The explanation propounded, which is the one given above for
        the phenomena of the same order, rests on no transmutation.
        Matter being easily dissociated and constituting an immense
        reservoir of intra-atomic energy, it is enough to admit that the
        lines of force seized upon by the conducting body which cuts
        them and causes them to flow in the form of an electric current,
        are constantly replaced at the expense of the intra-atomic
        energy. This last being relatively almost inexhaustible, a
        single magnet can furnish an almost infinite number of lines of
        force. </p>
      <p>The displacement of the conducting body in the magnetic field
        serves solely to put it in the condition necessary for absorbing
        the lines of force and giving them the form of an electric
        current. A determinate quantity of movement and consequently of
        work is, then, required to generate a certain quantity of
        electricity; but we are in no way justified in deducing from
        this the transformation into electricity of the simple movement
        of a body. </p>
      <p>Therefore, when we see at work these gigantic dynamos whence
        torrents of electric fluid flow, we should not say that they
        represent movement transformed into electricity. It is simply
        the intra-atomic energy of dissociated matter which appears
        under the form of electricity. </p>
      <p>Here, again, we perceive the fertility of the principles I have
        propounded on the dissociation of matter and the magnitude of
        intra-atomic energy. The immense reservoir of forces contained
        in matter allows us to explain the majority of phenomena, from
        the electricity which lights our street to the solar heat whence
        life is derived. </p>
      <p><b>3. The Problem of the Origin of the Lines of Force</b> </p>
      <p>Into most of the phenomena we have just examined the lines of
        force enter. They seem to be the fundamental elements of
        electricity. </p>
      <p>Faraday, starting from the idea, which contravened, however,
        that of most physicists of his time, that matter cannot act at a
        distance -- that is to say, where it is not -- deduced therefrom
        the existence of an intermediary connecting electrified bodies.
        He was thus led to recognize that these last are surrounded by
        lines of force throughout the whole space or so-called electric
        field in which their action is produced. </p>
      <p>The illustrious physicist attributed to these lines a very real
        existence, and by no means considered them as a simple
        mathematical expression. He regarded them as a kind of elastic
        springs, repelling each other mutually, and connecting bodies
        charged with electricities of contrary sign. Their extremities,
        affixed to these bodies, constituted the electric charge. </p>
      <p>Faraday put in evidence the lines of force which surround
        magnets by the classic experiment o iron filings powdered on a
        card under which are placed the two poles of a magnet. These
        filings spread themselves over the card in the direction of the
        lines of force. </p>
      <p><b>Figure 8</b> </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="1fig8.jpg" height="243" width="384"></p>
      </center>
      <p>It was supposed by an extension of this theory that Faraday
        supposed electrified bodies to be surrounded by lines of force
        analogous to those round the poles of a magnet. At the present
        day we possess several means of rendering their existence plain
        (1). They may even be photographed, by using the luminous ions
        which, during electric discharge, follow their direction. Figure
        7 shows the lines of force radiating round an insulated
        electrified body. Figure 8 shows the repulsion of the lines of
        force between two bodies bearing electric charges of the same
        sign. </p>
      <p>[(1) That lines of force also appear between conductors
        carrying an electrostatic charge can be shown by interposing
        between them a glass vessel filled with oil of turpentine and
        crystals of quinine sulfate. See Kolbe’s <i>Introduction to the
          Science of Electricity</i>, 1903, p. 125, et seq.] </p>
      <p>Of what are the lines of force composed? Maxwell considered
        then to be formed of ether cells, whirling round lines serving
        as axes. Between them would exist the particles which constitute
        electricity. No experiment allows us to verify this theory. We
        must confine ourselves to noting the action of lines of force
        without being able to say anything regarding their structure.
        They possess properties showing that they are produced in the
        ether rather than in the matter whence they appear to issue. </p>
      <p>On e of the most fundamental of these properties, although it
        is hardly mentioned in the textbooks, is that of passing
        through, or behaving as if they passed through, all material
        substances, whether conductors or insulators. This the x-rays
        and the particles emitted by radium do to only a slight extent.
        It is precisely because this property had been almost
        unperceived by physicists that they were so impressed at the
        time of the discovery of radiations passing through matter.
        Bodies can, however, be traversed by lines of force much more
        easily than by easily than by the x-rays. If the lines of force
        had been capable of acting on the photographic plate, the x-rays
        would never have caused the excitement we all remember. The
        imperfect passage of these last through bodies alone permitted
        the celebrated photography of the bones of the hand which has
        been so much talked about. </p>
      <p>The experiment of Faraday’s cage, showing that bodies
        surrounded by a metallic screen connected with the earth cannot
        receive an electric charge, makes us forget the ease with which
        metals allow themselves to be transpierced by lines of force. By
        doing away with the earth-wire, a metal opposes no obstacle to
        their passage. </p>

        order to render evident this passage of the lines of force
        through both metals and insulators, proves that an electroscope
        protected by three concentric cylinders, whether of metal or of
        ebonite, can be instantaneously charged. Naturally the metallic
        cylinders are placed on an insulating support. </p>
      <p>The transparency of bodies to magnetic lines of force is as
        complete as to electric lines of force, but is too well known to
        require demonstration. Everyone knows that a magnet cannot act
        in a compass through a door or a non-magnetic metallic body. </p>
      <p>Nothing, moreover, is easier than to verify this. A compass is
        placed at a short distance from a magnet. The deviation of the
        needle is noticed, then a thick plate of non-magnetic metal is
        interposed between the compass and the magnet. The needle of the
        compass is not displaced. Therefore the lines of force have
        passed through the metal without undergoing any trace of
        absorption, and act on the compass. But if the interposed body
        were capable of magnetization, it would seize upon the lines of
        force of the magnet, and would then constitute a magnetic
        screen. It is just, as before said, this capture of the lines of
        force which produces magnetization and also magnetic induction
        when we displace a conductor in a magnetic field. </p>
      <p>These lines of force, the properties of which have just been
        demonstrated, have no analogy with material substances, and yet
        it is evident they come from matter. The neighborhood of an
        electrified rod of glass or resin draws them forth from it, and
        it suffices to withdraw the latter for them to return to it. </p>
      <p>Without even bringing an electrified body neat to matter, we
        can draw from it lines of force. It is enough to put in contact
        two heterogeneous substances. We then observe that, if the
        surfaces of the two bodies are drawn apart, they are connected
        by lines of force which lengthen or shorten as the surfaces are
        farther apart of nearer. They are real elastic threads, as
        Faraday recognized, but of what are they formed? If they are
        composed solely of ether, their property of lengthening
        indefinitely and of shortening down to molecular dimensions is
        not easy to interpret. </p>
      <p>It is hardly possible at the present day to dispute the very
        real existence of lines of force. A magnetic field formed by
        them is a sort of viscous medium, dragging with it the bodies
        plunged therein when we put it in motion. Masses of metal
        introduced into a magnetic field follow it in its rotation.
        Industrial electricity at the present day utilizes these
        "rotating fields" to put bodies in motion without any material
        mechanism. </p>
      <p>These facts, as yet little capable of explanation, especially
        tend to put in evidence the close relations of mater with the
        ether, on which I have so much insisted, and which the science
        of today makes into two widely distinct domains. When their
        extreme form -- for instance, a sun ray and a block of metal --
        are alone studied, they seem, in fact, very different. But by
        the examination of the intermediate elements linking up these
        forms so dissimilar in appearance, we demonstrate that the ether
        and matter are not two separate worlds, but one and the same
        world. </p>

        <b><font size="+1">The Electric Waves</font></b></center>
      <p><b>1. Properties of the Electric Waves</b> </p>
      <p>In 1888 the physicist Hertz discovered that oscillating
        electric discharges generate in the ether a series of
        undulations analogous to those produced by the fall of a body
        into water. He demonstrated that these waves are propagated,
        refracted, and polarized like light, and circulate with the same
        velocity, only differing from light waves by their dimensions.
        The smallest electric waves are 5 millimeters long, while the
        largest light waves are 50 microns. The latter are therefore 100
        times smaller than the former. </p>
      <p>Electric waves produce induction currents in the conductors
        they meet with. It was by noticing the sparks generated by these
        currents that Hertz revealed the existence of the waves which
        today bear his name; and it is on the propagation of these waves
        in space that wireless telegraphy is based. To reveal their
        presence at a distance we had only to find a reagent analogous
        to the ear for sound, or to the photographic plate for light. </p>
      <p>The only characteristics common to electric waves and light are
        their speed of propagation, and their capacity for reflection,
        refraction, and polarization. But it must be remarked that any
        periodical disturbance of the ether, whatever be its cause, must
        necessarily possess similar properties. It is therefore perhaps
        going too far to deduce from this the identity of the Hertzian
        and the light waves. This could only be properly admitted if
        these last also possessed electromagnetic properties, and
        consequently were able to produce induction currents in
        conductors. Now, we have never been able to obtain with light
        waves any electric or magnetic phenomenon, nor to verify their
        propagation along a wire, as in the case of electric waves. </p>
      <p>There would be no interest in dwelling on these differences, as
        the electromagnetic theory of light -- now generally admitted --
        corresponds to that yearning for simplicity and unification so
        general in physics at the present time. Time alone can stem such
        currents of opinion. </p>
      <p>Abandoning, then, the idea of disputing the value of analogies
        now universally accepted, we will confine ourselves to the
        remark in passing that Hertzian are to electricity what radiant
        heat is to that circulating in matter. A heated body radiates
        into the ether what are called waves of radiant heat, which
        raise the temperature of the substances on which they fall. An
        electrified body suddenly discharged radiates so-called electric
        waves which charge with electricity the bodies that they meet.
        There is in this a parallel which, however, in no way leads to
        identification. The causes which determine the production of
        waves of radiant heat seem to possess only distant analogies
        with those of electric waves. </p>
      <p><b>2. Sensitiveness of Matter to the Electric Waves</b> </p>
      <p>The more we study matter, the more we are struck by its
        extraordinary sensitiveness. Under its apparent rigidity it
        possesses a very complicated structure and an intense life.
        Fragment of metal can be so acted upon at a distance of several
        hundred kilometers by simple vibrations of the ether, that they
        become conductors of electric current, the passage of which they
        at first present. This capacity for impression is another hint
        of the relations which connect the ether with matter. </p>
      <p>The reagent for electric waves employed by Hertz was not very
        sensitive. It simply consisted of a wire bent into a circle,
        terminating at its extremities in two balls brought very close
        together. Moving this receiver about in space, he saw break
        forth between the balls, on the passage of the waves, small
        induction sparks produced by their action. Receiving these waves
        in a large cylindro-parabolic metal mirror, he recognized that
        it was in its focus that the greatest production of sparks was
        manifested. Compelling them to pass through a prism of bitumen,
        he observed that they were deviated. Thus their reflection and
        their refraction were demonstrated. </p>
      <p>Hertz’s receiver was not very sensitive, since it did not
        reveal the existence of electric waves at more than a few meters
        from their point of emission. This was fortunate; for if Hertz
        had made use of the receivers now employed for wireless
        telegraphy, the phenomena of reflection, refraction, and
        polarization could only have been discovered with great
        difficulty. I have often noted, in fact, that sensitive
        receivers placed in the focus of the Hertz mirror, or by the
        side of or even behind it, give identical indication, and I
        shall have occasion to explain why. As has often been the case
        in the history of science, the rude instrument has rendered more
        service than a delicate one. </p>
      <p>With the receivers of slight sensitiveness employed by Hertz,
        the apparatus producing the waves had to be very powerful and
        consequently very bulky. Thanks to the receiver discovered by
        Branly, the most insignificant sparks suffice, on the contrary,
        to make an impression (Figure 10). </p>
      <p><b>Figure 10</b> </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="1fig10.jpg" height="360" width="396"></p>
      </center>
      <p>In spite of it marvelous sensitiveness, the receiver called the
        radio-conductor or filings tube is so simple that any one can
        easily make it. It consists merely of a small glass tube
        containing two rods of metal two or three millimeters apart,
        between which is interposed a small quantity of metal filings.
        Thus constituted the tube insulates; but on being struck by
        electric waves sent by a radiator, which may be placed hundreds
        of kilometers away, it becomes a conductor and allows the
        current of the battery to pass into the circuit, which also
        contains an electromagnet designed to operate an ordinary Morse
        telegraph. A slight blow on the tube, automatically given by
        another electromagnet thrown into circuit by a relay, serves to
        bring it back to its original state and allows a fresh signal to
        be given. </p>
      <p>As has just been said, these receivers are so sensitive that
        the very weakest source of electricity is sufficient to act on
        them. The difficulty is not to be able to produce electric
        waves, but rather to manage not to do so when it is desirable to
        avoid it. Any sudden discharge of an electrified body, however
        small the spark may be, produces electric waves. They can be
        obtained by rubbing a rod of resin, by sounding an electric
        bell, by opening or closing the circuit of a battery, etc. I
        have caused a receiver to act at a distance of 50 centimeters
        away by the spark from a simple ebonite rod rubbed with a
        catskin and afterwards touched by a metallic object of fairly
        large capacity such as a key or coin. </p>
      <p>The discovery by M. Branly of the variation in conductivity of
        metal filings under the influence of the Hertzian rays,
        certainly constitutes one of the most remarkable discoveries in
        modern physics, especially because it opens up unforeseen
        horizons on phenomena still very mysterious, and on which the
        sagacity of physicists will no doubt have to exercise itself for
        a long time. </p>
      <p>We have here a very general fact which is in no way limited to
        the case of metal filings. This is that fragments of metal in
        contact with one another and presenting considerable resistance
        -- 30,00 ohms, for example -- to the passage of electricity,
        become conductors under the influence of very weak electric
        waves, and lose this conductivity by a simple shock. These
        variations indicate a great variability in the aggregation of
        atoms under the influence of infinitely weak but appropriate
        forces. </p>
      <p>Most discontinuous conductors can exhibit these variations. Now
        we hardly handle any other than discontinuous conductors. A
        continuous conductor, such as a metal wire, becomes
        discontinuous immediately we connect it to the terminals of a
        battery. And we have just seen that in a discontinuous conductor
        the resistance is not at all -- at least for a number of metals
        -- a constant magnitude depending on the section and the length
        of the wire according to Ohm’s law, it follows that the
        conductivity of certain metallic bodies may vary in immense
        proportions according to the pressure of the wires by the
        binding screws and the circumstances in which they are used.
        Even with a constant pressure this resistance may still very
        considerably, since it suffices to cause an electric spark in
        their neighborhood in order to modify the resistance of the
        contact. Now the simple fact of opening o closing a current
        produces such sparks. A filings-tube with a variable resistance
        is only an exaggeration of these effects. </p>
      <p>It is easy to illustrate what has just been said by a curious
        experiment due to M. Branly. A column of metal of 30 or 40 cm in
        height is formed by placing one upon the other a series of
        polished discs of bismuth, aluminum, etc., of the dimensions of
        a 5-franc piece. The column may even be made merely of polished
        steel balls placed in a test tube. The resistance of this column
        to the passage of an electric current is still considerable. If
        we make a small electric spark near it, the resistance becomes
        almost nil. To cause it to reappear, it suffices to give a tap
        to the upper part of the column. </p>
      <p>These variations are still more exaggerated if the column,
        instead of being formed of discs of the same metal, is composed
        of discs of different metals. With a column of alternate discs
        of lead and aluminum, a few taps will suffice to raise the
        resistance to about 30,000 ohms, and very slight electric waves
        sent from a distance reduce this enormous resistance to 3 ohms.
      </p>
      <p>This variability of resistance is not observed in all metals in
        contact, for copper is a notable exception, and it is fortunate
        it is so. The law of Ohm I = E/R naturally implies the knowledge
        of R. Now, if the physicists who established it had used wires
        of different metals other than copper, it could not have been
        discovered. They would have noted, in fact, by using any
        measuring apparatus whatever -- the Wheatstone Bridge, for
        instance -- that the resistance constantly varies in large
        proportions for a given length of wire, and that the variations
        of pressure in the binding-screws did not explain this
        phenomenon. Even had they noticed the influence of a spark
        emitted close by -- and the opening or the closure of the
        battery current employed always produces one -- they could not
        have deduced any measurement from it, since the effects of these
        sparks vary greatly from experiment to experiment. The final
        conclusion would no doubt have been that a wire of constant
        dimensions may in apparently identical circumstances allow very
        different quantities of electricity to pass, which is directly
        contrary to Ohm’s law. This law, which is the basis of all our
        practical knowledge of electricity, would no doubt have been
        discovered, but much later and by very roundabout ways. </p>
      <p>The property peculiar to a small number of metals of remaining
        uninfluenced by electric waves seems able to communicate itself
        to neighboring bodies, as if these metals possessed a kind of
        metallic atmosphere. Let us take a column of copper discs, which
        metal has an invariable conductivity. The resistance of this
        column will be a constant magnitude depending on the height and
        diameter of the discs, and will consequently obey Ohm’s law.
        Take a second column of aluminum discs, a metal of variable
        conductivity, and their resistance will vary in considerable
        proportions according to the conditions, such as shock,
        conveyance of electric waves, etc, enumerated above. Let us now
        mix the discs of the two columns in such a way that a disc of
        copper follows one of aluminum. The copper communicates its
        properties to the aluminum, and the column behaves as if it were
        composed solely of copper. Its resistance has become invariable;
        it now obeys Ohm’s law. </p>
      <p><b>3. The Propagation of Electric Waves at a Distance and Their
          Future Utilization</b> </p>
      <p>We have seen that Hertzian waves propagate themselves in space
        to a distance of hundreds of kilometers, and produce on the
        metallic bodies they meet electrical induction currents capable
        of manifesting themselves in the form of sparks. </p>
      <p>This production of electricity at a distance is very slight,
        because the electric waves disperse their energy to all
        directions of the horizon (1). But it would be quite otherwise
        if we could concentrate them on one point by means of mirrors or
        reflectors, as we do with light. Such reflectors
        (cylindro-parabolic mirrors) were indeed used by Hertz in his
        experiments, since it was owing to them that he demonstrated the
        reflection of the electric waves; but unfortunately, by reason
        of the size of these waves, and the consequent phenomena of
        diffraction, the greater part of the energy is lost. To
        concentrate it, mirrors of gigantic dimensions would be
        necessary. </p>
      <p>[(1) But not equally. Dr Marconi’s experiments have shown that
        the Hertzian waves emitted from the antenna of a Marconi
        apparatus, for instance, are projected farther in one direction
        than another, the curve of their activity taking the form of a
        pear, of which the antenna represents the stalk.] </p>
      <p>However, I do not believe the solution to the problem is
        impossible, and if I have not carried out the plan of researches
        on this subject which I intended to effect, it is solely on
        account of the expense they would have necessitated. I intended
        to place side by side, and in contact with each other, a large
        number of cylindro-parabolic mirrors. These need not have been
        very high, for we can easily induce the waves to form in a plane
        of slight thickness. I should then have tried to produce
        extremely intense electric fields, such as we can obtain with
        divers instruments -- the Oudin resonator notably. When this
        apparatus works with a coil having a 60 cm spark, all the
        metallic objects in a room 10 meters long are charged by
        induction to such a high degree that they spontaneously emit
        thousands of sparks. They once produced in my presence, at a
        distance of several meters, short-circuits in a switch-board
        containing voltmeters and ammeters, etc, connected by wires with
        a double coating of insulating material. In the result, these
        short circuits caused the wires to melt, and the experiment had
        to be immediately stopped for fear of fire. </p>
      <p>The problem of sending a pencil of parallel Hertzian waves to a
        distance possesses more than a theoretical interest. It is
        allowable to say that its solution would change the course of
        our civilization by rendering war impossible. The first
        physicists who realizes this discovery will be able to avail
        himself of the presence of an enemy’s ironclads gathered
        together in a harbor to blow them up in a few minutes, from a
        distance of several kilometers, simply by directing on them a
        sheaf of electric radiations. On reaching the metal wires with
        which these vessels are nowadays honeycombed, this will excite
        an atmosphere of sparks which will at once explode the shells
        and torpedoes stored in their holds. </p>
      <p>With the same reflector, giving a pencil of parallel
        radiations, it would not be much more difficult to cause the
        explosion of the stores of powder and shells contained in a
        fortress, or in the artillery parks of an army corps, and
        finally the metal cartridges of the soldiers. Science, which at
        first rendered wars so deadly, would then at length have
        rendered them impossible, and the relation between nations would
        have to be established on new bases. </p>
      <p>It must not be supposed that by any means whatever that a ship
        or fortress could be protected from the action of the Hertzian
        waves. No doubt our experiments have proved, as we shall see in
        a later chapter, that a sheet of metal 1/100th of a millimeter
        thick completely stops the electric waves, but the same
        experiments have also proved that this theoretical protection is
        entirely illusory. The slightest crack between the joints of an
        enclosure permits the Hertzian waves to pass without difficulty
      </p>
      <p>There would be no interest in dwelling further on this subject.
        I have more than once in my researches come across problems the
        solutions of which would modify the march of civilization more
        profoundly than all the changes of constitutions and reforms. It
        is only in the progress of science that great social
        transformations can be looked for. </p>

        <b><font size="+1">Transparency of Matter to Electric Waves</font></b></center>
      <p><b>1. History of the Ideas Relating to the Transparency of
          Bodies to Hertzian Waves</b> </p>
      <p>The ideas current on the transparency of bodies to the Hertzian
        waves were very erroneous when I published my researches in
        1899. Experiment seemed to indicate that all metals of slight
        thickness and insulating bodies of any thickness could be
        transpierced by the,, but both these views were inexact. At the
        beginning of his researches, Hertz recognized that metals
        reflected the electric waves and consequently presented a
        certain opacity; but was this opacity total or partial? This was
        the point left unascertained. </p>
      <p>In the minds of most authors transparency appeared probable in
        the case of slight thicknesses. "M. Joubert discovered that a
        wall of zinc 2-5 mm thick, 4 meters high, and 8 meters long,
        weakened the sparks without completely destroying them, and that
        they could still be observed on the other side of this wall"
        (Quoted by Poincare, <i>Electricity et Optique</i>. Poincare
        points out that it might perhaps be explained by diffraction,
        which is indeed the correct explanation, as we shall see alter.)
      </p>
      <p>Sir Oliver Lodge, who has made numerous experiments on Hertzian
        waves, likewise thought he had noticed the transparency of
        metals, but supposes that at a 'reasonable' thickness they must
        be opaque (1). We are ignorant as to the value to be attached to
        what the author understands by "reasonable thickness". </p>
      <p>[(1) Lodge, <i>The Work of Hertz and Some of his Successors</i>;
        1891) </p>
      <p>Prof. Bose, to whom we owe a very complete memoir on the
        Hertzian waves, and who has invented some very ingenious
        apparatus to measure their length, has likewise arrived, by
        precise and apparently demonstrative experiments, at the
        conclusion that metals are transparent to Hertzian waves. I here
        give the translation of the passage of the memoir in which he
        narrates how he was led to this conclusion. After explaining all
        the precautions taken to enclose his instruments in a perfectly
        closed metal box, the learned physicist adds: -- </p>
      <p>"Notwithstanding all these precaution, I was baffled for more
        than 6 months by an unknown cause of error which I could not
        discover for a long time. It was only recently, when almost
        convinced of the uselessness of continuing my researches, that I
        discovered that I was mistaken in supposing that the tinplate
        sides of the case were [perfectly opaque to electric radiations.
        The metal box containing the radiator seems to transmit a few
        radiations though its walls, and if the receiver is sensitive it
        indicates this slight transmission. I than had a second metal
        envelope made, and found this precaution to be efficacious so
        long as the receiver was not placed to close to the radiator.
        Notwithstanding these two metallic envelopes, the receiver is
        still affected if placed immediately above the radiator" (1). </p>

      <p>More recently still, M. Henri Veillon made some analogous
        experiments in the Physical Laboratory of the University of
        Bale. They had as object the discovery of "the part played by
        conducting bodies placed between the receiver and the
        transmitter from which come the oscillations". After
        acknowledging the difficulty of the subject the author declares
        that he only ascribes to his experiments "the character of a
        simple contribution to a study offering great difficulties". The
        most important of his experiments is the following: -- The
        receiver was placed in a zinc case 1 mm thick closed by a lid
        sliding in a groove, with the radiator outside. Under these
        conditions the experiment demonstrated to him that the action of
        the waves transmitted by the radiator "passed through the metal
        envelope, but only when the sparks did not pass at too great a
        distance (about 1.5 meters)" (2). This conclusion, we see, is
        the same as that of Prof. Bose. </p>
      <p>[(2) <i>Archives Sciences Physiques et Naturelles de Geneve</i>,
        May 1898 ] </p>
      <p>It results clearly from the above extracts that the most exact
        researches seemed to prove the transparency of metals to
        Hertzian waves. They appeared very conclusive. They were not, as
        we shall presently see. </p>
      <p>As regards the transparency of conducting bodies it was
        considered as absolute. At the outset of his researches, Hertz
        noticed the transparency of dielectrics -- sulfur, wood, glass,
        etc. It is even by their means that he succeeded in
        demonstrating the phenomenon of the refraction of electric waves
        by large prisms of bitumen. </p>
      <p>Since then, dielectrics have always been considered very
        transparent to electric waves, and it has even been inquired
        whether they might not give a trace of absorption. Righi, in his
        researches, arrived at this conclusion: "That it can be
        considered demonstrated that the diminution of intensity to
        which the radiations passing through the plates of certain
        dielectrics are subject, are really due to absorption". </p>
      <p>Wireless telegraphy experiments seemed to confirm this
        hypothesis absolutely. The majority of observers have noted, in
        fact, that walls, and even hills, were traversed by electric
        waves, and this observation is still reproduced in several works
        which have become classic. </p>
      <p>I therefore found myself in presence of two problems: -- </p>
      <p>(1) Can metals of slight thickness be traversed by Hertzian
        waves? (2) Are non-conducting bodies of any thickness
        transparency to them? </p>
      <p>These problems had for me a very great theoretical importance.
        Their solution was very delicate, and as they necessitated a
        laboratory of larger dimensions than I possessed, I asked Prof
        Branly to be kind enough to participate in these researches. We
        together published the results obtained in the <i>Comtes Rendu
          de l’Acadamie des Sciences</i> (April 1, 1899, p. 879). </p>
      <p>The difficulties of all kinds we had to overcome before
        reaching a definite result thoroughly explain the erroneous
        conclusions to which very skillful physicists had been
        previously led. </p>
      <p><b>2. Opaqueness of Metals to the Electric Waves</b> </p>
      <p>In order to ascertain whether metals in thin or thick plates
        allowed the electric waves to pass through them, M. Branly and I
        had some cubical boxes about 50 cm square constructed of
        different metals, and between 0.02 mm and 2 mm thick, in which
        the receiving apparatus was placed. The apertures of these cases
        were closed by a most closely-fitting door. The radiator
        producing the waves was placed a few inches away from the
        apparatus, and the receiver was of course put inside the box. It
        revealed the passage of the electric waves through the walls by
        causing a bell to ring (Figures 11 and 12) </p>
      <p><b>Figure 11</b> </p>

      </center>
      <p>The first experiments seems to confirm absolutely the
        researches above quoted. Like Mr Bose and other experimenters,
        we noticed that the electric waves seemed to pas through the
        metal. The moment the radiator began to act, the bell inside the
        metal box could be heard. </p>
      <p>Although these experiments agreed with those of the authors
        quoted, we would not be satisfied with them. We had the metal
        doors readjusted by fitting to each of them half-a-dozen screws
        in such a way that we could close them hermetically. When these
        precautions were taken, we noticed that as soon as the screws
        were tightened, the bell remained silent. The radiations
        therefore did not pass through the metal; they simply passed
        through the very narrow gaps left by the metal doors. The
        transparency observed by former observers was due solely to the
        imperfect closing of the metal boxes in which they enclosed
        their apparatus. The precautions taken by photographers to
        protect their laboratories from the entry of light would be
        quite insufficient to protect them from the entry of the
        electric waves. </p>
      <p>These experiments were repeated many hundred of times with the
        same result -- tightening of the screws, silence of the bell;
        loosening of the screws, ringing of the bell. </p>
      <p>We then tried with several metals, the effect produced by the
        thickness of the envelope, and it proved absolutely nil. A case
        of thin wood, lined with tin and only 1/100 mm thick, proved to
        be as adequate as boxes of metal of 2 mm. </p>
      <p>The protection exercised by a metal envelope is quite
        remarkable. In the metal door which closes the case let us
        solder, perpendicularly to its center, a brass rod projecting 30
        cm inside the box, and protruding as much outside (Figures 11
        and 12). Let us connect the circuit of the filings-tube to the
        inside portion of this rod, and place its outside part in
        contact with the radiator. It would seem that under these
        conditions the receiver ought to act. Now, it does nothing of
        the kind. Though the electric waves are propagates, as we know,
        along wires, that part of the rod which is inside the metal box
        entirely ceases to conduct. As the walls of the case form a
        screen, the electric waves take the shortest road, which is,
        evidently, the outer surface of the metal cage. By touching the
        latter with the finger during the experiment we can draw from it
        numerous sparks. </p>
      <p>The above experiments, and notably that which consists on
        causing or arresting the passage of the electric waves by
        tightening or loosening the screws closing the door of the metal
        case, prove that the tiniest slits allow the passage of the
        electric waves. Being thus led to examine the influence of these
        slits, we noted that if we replaced a slit intentionally made in
        the metal box by a series of holes the total area of which
        greatly exceeded that of the slit, the passage of the electric
        waves took place through these holes much less easily than
        through the slit. The radiator only needed to be placed a few
        meters farther off, and the bell remained silent. Thus one
        hundred round holes of 1 cm diameter do not give passage to the
        electric waves so long as the radiator is more than 50 cm
        distant, while with a crack 1 mm wide by 20 cm long, the
        receiver in the box was affected at all the distances at our
        disposal, and even when the radiator was placed in an adjacent
        room. With a slit made by simply passing the edge of a razor
        across the metal, the outer box was still transpierced by the
        waves, but at one-sixth of the distance employed with the slit
        of 1 mm. </p>
      <p>If the slit is perpendicular to the axis of the four balls of
        the radiator, the box is transpierced from a distance 6 to 8
        times greater than when the slit is parallel to that axis. </p>
      <p>These experiments led to the presumption that a wire gauze of
        fine mesh would act exactly like a solid sheet, and this was
        easily verified by observation. An envelope of wire gauze, with
        meshes 1 mm square, is opaque, save when the radiator is only a
        few centimeters away. </p>
      <p>From what precedes, it results that metal envelopes act with
        regard to the electric waves much as Faraday’s cage does with
        regard to electrostatic induction. It will be remarked. However,
        in the case of electric waves, that the slits exercise an
        influence which is not produced in the case of static
        electricity. There must be likewise observed in electric waves
        the facility with which they pass through very narrow slits
        while square openings large enough for the insertion of a finger
        will not allow them to pass. Electric waves appear to behave as
        if they were rigid and similar to a metal disc which passes
        without difficulty through a sufficiently large slit, but is
        stopped by an orifice smaller than its diameter. </p>
      <p>We often indeed had occasion, in the course of our experiments,
        so observe the facility with which the electric waves travel
        round obstacles. This is evidently a diffraction phenomenon
        depending on the size of the waves produced by the radiator
        employed. Whether, in the preceding experiments, the radiator be
        placed before, behind, or at the side of the face of the box
        containing the receiver, with an imperfectly fitting metal door
        the bell will act equally well. It is precisely for this reason
        that, with apparatus as sensitive as ours, it would have been
        very difficult, as has been said, for Hertz to effect his
        researches on the refraction, reflection, and polarization of
        the waves of which he discovered the existence. If Lodge was
        able to repeat them with filings-tubes it is because, from the
        very nature of their construction, they possessed no greater
        sensitiveness than the receivers of Hertz. </p>
      <p>It is the passing round obstacles through the effects of
        diffraction which has above all contributed to deceive observers
        as to the transparency of voluminous bodies to electric waves.
        Whether it be a liquid, an electric, or an acoustic wave which
        is in question, an obstacle is all the more effectively passed
        round the greater the wavelength relatively to the dimensions of
        the obstacle. The sound of a flute played behind a house is less
        perceptible than a trombone, precisely because the sound waves
        produced by the trombone are longer than those produced by the
        flute, and consequently pass more easily round the house.
        Electric waves, being very large, easily pass round large
        obstacles; while light rays, being very small, can only pass
        round obstacles of the dimensions of a hair. It is for this
        reason that the phenomenon of diffraction, so easy of
        observation, has been so difficult to establish in the case of
        light. It is solely because he could not observe it, that Newton
        contested the wave theory of undulations. If light, said he,
        were constituted of waves, bodies would have no shadows, because
        the waves would turn round their edges as sound turns a corner
        and liquid waves a rock. </p>
      <p>From what has been said, we may conclude that rigidly closed
        metallic screens, however slight the thickness of the metal,
        offer an absolute obstacle to the passage of electric waves. </p>
      <p>It will not be without its use to point out that in practice
        the protection afforded by metallic envelopes will always be
        illusory, because it is extremely difficult to make hermetically
        closed envelopes. </p>
      <p>Our researches prove that metals are opaque to electric waves,
        but their transparency, which seemed, moreover, demonstrated by
        all the early experiments, offered nothing improbable. This
        transparency, no doubt, did not agree with Maxwells’s equations,
        but as one can never get anything out of an equation which has
        not been previously put into it, it would have sufficed to put
        in something else to have drawn out quite different conclusions.
        Metals are very transparent, as we saw in another chapter, to
        electric and magnetic lines of force, and nothing proved
        absolutely that they were not so to electric waves. </p>
      <p>It was, therefore, experiment alone that allowed the question
        to be decided. </p>
      <p><b>3. Transparency of Non-Conducting Bodies to Electric Waves</b>
      </p>
      <p>The transparency of non-conducting bodies to the Hertzian
        waves, which has been known since the first researches of Hertz,
        is confirmed by all the experiments of wireless telegraphy. But
        is this transparency complete? Do the Hertzian waves really pass
        through hills and houses, as we have been taught? </p>
      <p>One may ask -- (1) If the transparency of non-metallic bodies
        does note vary with the bodies and also with their thickness?
        (2) If the transparency of very voluminous bodies like hills is
        not merely an appearance resulting from the fact that the
        electric waves, resembling in this sound waves, pass round
        obstacles. </p>
      <p>To resolve these questions definitely, the following
        experiments were effected in conjunction with M. Branly: -- </p>
      <p>We constructed a box of Portland cement with sides 10 cm thick,
        of which the side left open could be closed by a metal door
        carefully adjusted and capable of being hermetically closed by
        screws. The instruments designed to reveal the passage of the
        waves -- that is to say, a needle galvanometer, a battery, an
        electric bell, and the filings-tube which becomes a conductor as
        soon as it is struck by the electric waves -- were placed in
        this box before it was closed. </p>
      <p>After hermetically closing the case, and placing close to it a
        radiator with balls operated by a 15 cm spark coil, the
        apparatus was put in operation. From the first spark we knew by
        the ringing of the bell that the sides of the box were perfectly
        transpierced. </p>
      <p>The experiment was repeated by moving the radiator gradually
        farther and farther off, and we verified, by the silence of the
        bell, that from more than 7 meters away no electric wave passed
        through the case. It then sufficed to loosen the screws of the
        door to hear the bell ring, which showed clearly that the walls
        of the case constituted the sole obstacle to the passage of the
        electric waves. After drying for several days, the case became a
        little more transparent, but still the radiator ceased to act at
        a distance greater than 12 meters. </p>
      <p>These first experiments proved that if an enclosure surrounded
        by a wall of mortar 12 cm thick allows the electric waves to
        pass, it still exercises a notable absorption, and becomes quite
        opaque at a little distance. </p>
      <p>To confirm this apparent influence of the thickness of the
        surrounding wall, we caused to be constructed a second box of
        cement, similar to the first, and only differing in that its
        walls were 30 cm thick. Twelve house after it was finished, and
        while it was yet quite damp, it showed itself absolutely opaque
        to the Hertzian waves, even when we placed the radiator a few
        centimeters from its sides. As it dried, it allowed a few waves
        to pass through, but only when the radiator was not farther off
        than about 1 meter. Beyond that distance, it remained opaque. </p>
      <p>These experiments confirmed the first, and showed that the
        absorption increased, as might have been supposed, with the
        thickness. They seemed to indicate also that water possessed
        noticeably absorbent properties. </p>
      <p>To verify this fact, we had a wooden box constructed with walls
        30 cm thick and filled with dry sand. In the middle was left a
        cavity closed by a metal door, arranged to receive the apparatus
        revealing the waves. </p>
      <p>Everything being thus ready, the radiator was put in operation,
        and we found that the sand behaved like an absolutely
        transparent body, exercising no absorption, perceptibly at
        least, at the distance of 40 meters, which was all that was at
        our disposal. </p>
      <p>We then poured into the case as much water as the sand would
        absorb, and, on repeating the experiment, a considerable
        diminution in the transparency was observed. </p>
      <p>The ease with which the dry sand allowed itself to be traversed
        led us to suppose that coarse-grained bodies such as stone might
        be more easily traversed than cement. </p>
      <p>To verify this we had cut a block of building stone of 1 meter
        cube, in the interior of which was left a little cavity to
        contain the receiver of the waves. This cavity was closed by a
        metal door carefully adjusted. </p>
      <p>The thickness of stone which the electric waves had to cross to
        reach the receiver was 10 cm. This thickness was, however,
        traversed without difficulty, even when we placed the radiator
        at the extreme limit of the garden where we were working -- that
        is to say, about 40 meters from the receiver. Stone was
        therefore much more transparent than cement. </p>
      <p>The stone was then wetted for several days, and at once its
        transparency diminished. It was no longer traversed except when
        the radiator was placed within 25 meters distance. </p>
      <p>In the preceding experiments, the dry sand and the dry stone
        seemed quite transparent, but this was only in appearance, and
        resulted from the fact that we had not space enough at our
        disposal to put the radiator far enough off to verify the
        absorption. To convince oneself of this, it is sufficient to
        reduce the intensity of the waves emitted by the radiator by
        using a smaller induction coil -- which comes to exactly the
        same thing as if the distance were increased with a higher
        source of radiation. It is then easily verified that the sand
        and the stone exercise an important power of absorption, and are
        by no means completely transparent. With a radiator operated by
        a coil giving sparks of 2 cm only, the block of dry sand of 30
        cm thick is no longer traversed at a distance greater than 16
        meters, not the block of dry stone beyond 13 meters. </p>
      <p>The above figures have, evidently, nothing absolute about them.
        They simply prove that the transparency of bodies to electric
        waves is by no means complete, as has been supposed. It is
        evident that according to the intensity of the source,
        differences of absorption will be noticed. Waves of 100 meters
        in length pass through bodies better than waves of 20 cm, but it
        is equally certain that there must always be some absorption,
        and that, consequently, mountains and houses are not traversed
        as was formerly supposed. </p>
      <p>I will sum up all that concerns the transparency of dielectrics
        to the Hertzian waves in the following propositions: -- </p>
      <p>(1) The transparency of non-metallic bodies to Hertzian waves
        depends on their nature, and varies considerably from one body
        to another; (2) this transparency is always much greater than
        that of these same bodies to light; (3) absorption increases in
        proportion as the thickness of the body in question increases;
        (4) humidity greatly increases the absorption; (5) when the
        electric waves meet great obstacles, such as hills, these
        obstacles are passed round and not transpierced. </p>
      <p>Though the practical deductions which may be drawn from our
        researches do not here concern us, it may not be without
        interest to point out that the preceeding observations may find
        applications in the establishing of wireless telegraphy
        stations. The electric waves being in part absorbed and
        consequently weakened by the small obstacles they meet, and
        obliged to pass round the large obstacles, which likewise
        weakens them, it will always be useful to place the emitting and
        receiving stations on elevated points. The crossing of arms of
        the sea and the communication of continents with islands,
        constitute for the above reasons the best conditions of
        transmission. </p>

        <b><font size="+1">The Different Forms of Electricity and Their
            Origin</font></b></center>
      <p><b>1. Does the Electricity Derived from Matter Exist in Matter?</b>
      </p>
      <p>According to a theory which in the last few years has become a
        dogma for many physicists, matter is composed entirely of
        electric particles called electrons, and its most fundamental
        property, inertia, is of electromagnetic origin. </p>
      <p>My work on <i>The Evolution of Matter</i> has already shown
        how little foundation there is for this hypothesis. But in order
        not to complicate an already difficult statement of novel
        things, I have kept to the almost classic terms derived from
        this theory. It can, moreover, in no way interfere with my
        statement, since things happen in appearance as if electricity
        existed completely formed in matter, instead of being, as I
        maintain, a secondary transformation of intra-atomic energy. </p>
      <p>The theory of electrons is now popular. The proof of this will
        be found in the following passage of a speech made by Mr
        Balfour, then Prime Minister of England, at one of the recent
        meetings of the British Association for the Advancement of
        Science. The speaker defends in it the new ideas with all the
        ardor of a neophyte: -- </p>
      <p>"Learned men", he said, "have come to look on brute matter as a
        simple appearance, of which electricity is, physically, the real
        basis, and to think that the elementary atom of the chemist is
        nothing more than a systematic grouping of electric monads or
        electrons -- which are not electrified matter, but electricity
        itself". </p>
      <p>This theory, which everywhere confounds cause and effect, is
        not derived from mathematical arguments alone. It is also based
        on the interpretation of certain observations, such as the
        composition of the emissions of radioactive bodies, the
        phenomenon of Zeeman, etc. But the fact which -- unconsciously
        at least -- has perhaps most influenced the idea of the learned
        is certainly the facility with which electricity is drawn from
        matter. It may be said, without too much exaggeration, that it
        is impossible to touch matter without causing electricity to
        come forth from it. It might also be said, and this time without
        any exaggeration at all, that a body cannot be touched without
        heat coming forth from it. No one, however, dreams of asserting
        that matter is composed of calorific particles. </p>
      <p>If the fluid called electricity existed complete in matter, it
        would be in an utterly inexplicable state of condensation. We
        know, in fact, that it is easy to extract from a small particle
        of matter a quantity of electricity out of all proportion to
        that which we can retain upon bodies of great volume. A small
        part of the 96,000 coulombs drawn from the decomposition of 9
        grams of water would charge with electricity to a potential of
        7000 volts a globe as large as the earth. </p>
      <p>It must be admitted that if electricity exists in matter, it is
        found there in a form which we cannot conceive. It is impossible
        to imagine a kind of condensation by the drawing together of the
        electrons supposed to compose the electric fluid, for they would
        exercise with regard to one another such immense repulsions that
        matter could not exist for a single instant. In my last book we
        saw that, if a charge of 1 coulomb would be concentrated on a
        small sphere and brought within 1 cm of another sphere bearing a
        similar charge, the work produced by its displacement at a
        velocity of 10 cm per second would be equal to 82,000 million
        kilogram-meters, or over one billion horsepower in the same
        space of time. </p>
      <p>But if electricity does not exist in matter, how can it be
        explained that it is so easy to draw the first-named from the
        second? When matter was considered as an inert thing only
        restoring the energy with which it had been at first supplied,
        no answer could be given to this question. Since I have shown
        that, contrary to the old belief, matter constitutes a colossal
        reservoir of a special energy -- intra-atomic energy -- it has
        become easy to explain how it is possible, at the expense of
        this energy, to obtain heat, electricity, or any other force.
        Without invoking any unknown phenomenon, I have shown how a tiny
        atom contains an immense quantity of energy. By calculations
        needless to reproduce, I have shown that a sphere the size of a
        pin’s head, revolving on its own axis with the speed of
        projection of the cathode particles, represents an amount of
        kinetic energy equal to that produced in an hour by 1500 steam
        engines of 500 hp each. </p>
      <p>The rotary movements attributed to the elements of matter alone
        explain how the particles of radioactive bodies are projected
        into space with a velocity of the same order as that of light. </p>
      <p>These velocities of rotation are necessary not only to explain
        the projections just mentioned, but also the equilibrium of the
        elements of which the atoms are formed. In the same way as the
        top falls to the ground the moment it ceases to turn, the
        elements of matter only keep themselves in equilibrium by their
        movements. If these last were stopped for a single instant, all
        bodies would be reduced to an invisible dust of ether, and would
        no longer be anything. </p>
      <p>This is why it has been possible to compare the atom to a small
        solar system composed of particles gravitating round one or
        several centers at some immense velocity. So soon as, from some
        cause or another, the centrifugal force resulting from the
        rotation of these elements exceeds the force of attraction which
        keeps them in their orbits, the particles of the periphery
        escape into space by following the tangent of the curve they
        pursue, like a stone hurled from a sling. </p>
      <p>In my last book, we considered electricity as an intermediary
        substance between matter and the ether, resulting from certain
        disturbances of equilibrium of the ether following upon the
        partial disaggregation of the atoms. According to the nature of
        these disturbances, light, heat, electricity, etc., result; but
        the elements which produce these effects have in themselves
        nothing electrical or calorific. </p>
      <p>If, therefore, matter can, by dissociating itself, produce
        various energies -- light, heat, electricity, etc. -- this does
        not in any way say that it is composed of light, heat or
        electricity. The conception of electrons, a near relative to the
        old phlogiston, is, as has been well shown by Prof de Heen, one
        of the most unfortunate metaphysical ideas recently formulated.
      </p>
      <p><b>2. The Various Forms of Electricity</b> </p>
      <p>The notion of a disturbance of equilibrium as the origin of any
        kind of force, is fundamental, and must always be present in the
        mind in order to understand the various forms of energy.
        Particles at rest are no more electricity than the ether at rest
        is light. When the equilibrium of this ether is disturbed, it
        experiences certain vibrations which we call light. As soon as
        these vibrations cease, the ether regains its equilibrium, and
        the light disappears. It is the same with electricity. As soon
        as the particles constituting the fluid termed electric are no
        longer in equilibrium, then, and only then, appear the phenomena
        called electricity. They disappear when these particles regain
        their equilibrium. One ought no more to speak of neutral
        electricity than of neutral movement, neutral heat, or neutral
        light. </p>
      <p>All forms of energy being produced by disturbances of
        equilibrium, it results from this that by varying these
        disturbances we generate different forces. To find new means of
        modifying the equilibria of matter and of the ether, is to
        discover new energies. So long as the equilibrium of the ether
        could only be modified in one single fashion, we observed only
        light. When we learned how to create new forms of equilibrium,
        we obtained the action of induction, Hertzian waves, x-rays,
        etc. </p>
      <p>It is entirely because the means of modifying the equilibrium
        of the ether and of matter are now becoming multiplied that we
        witness the discovery of new manifestations of energy. Science
        classifies them with much difficulty, not being able to connect
        them with things already known. The confusion which results from
        this will be easily made plain by the examination of the various
        phenomena which are still classed at present under the name of
        electricity. </p>
      <p>The following enumeration comprises forms of energy, very
        dissimilar, but possessing the common characteristic of being
        able, directly or indirectly, to produce what is called an
        electric charge. This is the only reason which permits things so
        different to be classed under the head of electricity. If we
        adopted in a general way this very summary process of
        classification, we should have to call heat all the causes which
        always produce it -- for example, friction and movement. </p>
      <p>(1) The Electric Fluid ~ We suppose it to be constituted by the
        union of the electric particles to which reference will be made
        later on. After having admitted the existence of two fluids --
        the one positive, the other negative -- the tendency now is to
        recognize only one, formed of negative elements. The positive
        fluid would thus be composed of material particles of some of
        their negative corpuscles. </p>
      <p>(2) Static Electricity ~ Formed by the accumulation of the
        electric fluid on a body. Is characterized by the power of
        producing attractions and repulsions but exercises no action on
        a magnet. </p>
      <p>(3) Dynamic Electricity ~ When a body charged with static
        electricity is connected by a conducting wire to an
        unelectrified body, it flows into this wire with a velocity
        which may reach that of light, and produces an electric current
        by the sole fact that the electric fluid is in motion; the wire
        which conducts it is itself surrounded by a field called
        magnetic, because it enjoys all the properties of a magnet. </p>
      <p>(4) Magnetism ~ Particular forms of electricity characterized
        by equilibria of unknown nature. Magnetism can in certain
        conditions generate an electric current [unipolar dynamo] in the
        same way that the electric current can generate magnetism. </p>
      <p>(5) The Electric Atoms or Electrons ~ Particles called
        electric, of definite magnitude, supposed to be constituted by
        vortices of the ether. May exist without material support in
        Crooke’s tubes, and in the emissions of radioactive bodies. Can
        pass through metal plates when their velocity is sufficient. </p>
      <p>(6) Cathode Rays ~ Formed by the projection of electric
        particles in a tube through which a current passes after a
        vacuum has been created in it. </p>
      <p>(7) X-Rays ~ Constituted by disturbances in the ether of a form
        still unknown, and taking birth when the cathode rays strike an
        obstacle. Pass through thick plates of metal. Possess no
        magnetic or electric property. </p>
      <p>(8) Negative Ions ~ Supposed to be formed of electric particles
        surrounded by attraction with material elements. </p>
      <p>(9) Positive Ions ~ Must be constituted by material atoms
        having lost their negative particles. Have never been isolated
        (1). </p>
      <p>[(1) It seems to me that the author here loses sight of the
        significance of his own experiment described in The Evolution of
        Matter (p. 385 and Figure 62). The "elements coming from the
        dematerialization of matter" which he there shows as passing
        through sheets of dielectric substances can be nothing but
        "positive ions", that is to say, sub-atomic particles of matter
        associated with a positive charge. It is difficult to see any
        distinction between these and the "Ionic Fluid" next mentioned.
        -- Ed.] </p>
      <p>(10) The Ionic Fluid ~ Formed of positive or negative ions
        mixed with gaseous particle. Can circulate through a metal worm
        before the elements of which it is formed recombine. </p>
      <p>(11) Neutral Electricity ~ Form of electricity totally unknown
        of which no reagent can reveal the presence, and supposed to be
        constituted by the union of the positive and negative fluid.
        Must exist in bodies in a state of extreme condensation, since
        there can be taken from one gram of water a quantity of
        electricity much exceeding that which it would be possible to
        keep on a globe the size of the earth. </p>
      <p>(13) Electric Waves ~ Disturbances of the ether which accompany
        electric discharges and are propagated by vibrations in the
        ether with a velocity which can attain that of light. They are
        to ordinary electricity what radiant heat is to the caloric
        phenomena of which matter may be the seat. By induction, the
        electric waves may generate at a distance on the bodies they
        strike currents of electricity capable of manifesting themselves
        in the form of sparks. </p>
      <p>Thus, then, by the sole fact of producing in the ether or in
        matter dissimilar disturbances of equilibrium, we create very
        different forces. It is only our need of simplification which
        leads us to put them together. We might evidently even further
        simplify them by saying that these energies only represent
        transformations of movement, but a definition of this kind would
        apply to all phenomena, including those of life. Such
        generalizations only translate our ignorance into other words. </p>

      </center>
      <p><b>1. Old and New Ideas on the Causes of Heat</b> </p>
      <p>Hardly any scientific subject has called forth so many
        researches as heat. Thanks to them, thermodynamics and the
        energetic theory, which are derived from it, have become precise
        and fertile sciences. </p>
      <p>But if we simply ask ourselves what these researches have
        revealed as to the causes of heat, we are bound to acknowledge
        that we are hardly more advanced than we were a century ago. We
        cannot find much to add to the following lines written by the
        illustrious Humpry Davy, a hundred years ago: </p>
      <p>"Since all matter may be made to fill a smaller volume by
        cooling, it is evident that the particles of matter must have
        space between them; and since every body can communicate the
        power of expansion to a body of a lower temperature, that is,
        can give an expansive motion to its particles, it is a probable
        inference that its own particles are possessed of motion; but as
        there is no change in the position of its parts as long as its
        temperature is uniform, the motion, if its exists, must be a
        vibratory or undulating motion, or a motion of the particles
        round their axes, or a motion of particles round each other. </p>
      <p>"It seems possible to account for all the phenomena of heat, if
        it be supposed that in solids the particles are in a constant
        state of vibratory motion, the particles of the hottest bodies
        moving with the greatest velocity, and through the greatest
        space; that in fluids and elastic fluids, besides the vibratory
        motion, which must be conceived greatest in the last, the
        particles have a motion round their won axes, with different
        velocities, the particles of elastic fluids moving with the
        greatest quickness; and that in ethereal substances the
        particles move round their own axes, and separate from each
        other, penetrating in right lines through space. Temperature may
        be conceived to depend upon the velocities of the vibrations;
        increase of capacity on the motion being performed in greater
        space; and the diminution of temperature during the conversion
        of solids into fluids or gases, may be explained on the idea of
        the revolution of particles round their axes, at the moment when
        the body becomes fluid or aeriform, or from the loss of rapidity
        of vibration, in consequence of the motion of the particles
        through greater space". </p>
      <p>At the present day, as in the time of Davy, we suppose that
        heat must be the consequence of the movements, vibratory,
        rotary, etc., of the particles of matter. All researched on the
        structure of atoms have justified the existence of the
        movements. Every atom is now compared to a solar system.
        Naturally we never observe these movements, and mechanical
        considerations alone lead us to suppose them identical with
        those of the planets around the sun. </p>
      <p>Every component particle of these atoms must be animated by two
        movements: (1) rotation of the particle on itself; (2)
        Revolution round a center. These movements may vary, as may the
        speed of translation, and also the diameter of the orbit
        traversed. By compelling the molecules to move nearer to or
        farther from each other, they explain the dilation of bodies by
        heat and their contraction by cold. </p>
      <p>The variations of equilibrium by these elements in motion
        should produce magnetism, electricity, and heat, but we are
        entirely ignorant of the way these forces are generated. </p>
      <p>We are able to measure heat without knowing anything of its
        essence. The expression "a quantity of heat" constitutes an
        arbitrary notion representing the measurement of an effect the
        cause of which is unknown. "It is nothing else", writes M.
        Duhem, "than the measurement given by the calorimeter, and is
        not otherwise defined. The quantity of heat which is disengaged
        in a modification is, by definition, a quantity proportional to
        the weight of water which this modification would raise from the
        temperature of zero to that of one degree". The insufficiency of
        such a conception is evident. </p>
      <p>Physicists have at length, however, laid aside this problem of
        the causes of heat, and, without inquiring how movements can be
        transformed into heat, they have confined themselves to
        endeavoring to determine their nature. Although the problem has
        been taken in hand by such physicists as Clausius and Helmholtz,
        no success has crowned their efforts. Assimilating, to simplify
        matters, the elements of bodies to material points in motion,
        they have admitted that the average force of this movement was
        proportional to the temperature, and have endeavored to deduce
        from it the laws of thermodynamics, and, notably, the principles
        of Carnot, by means of the theorems of mechanics. It is pretty
        much generally admitted nowadays that this attempt has
        completely failed. It has furnished, moreover, no sort of hint
        either as to the variations of trajectory described by the
        particles of bodies, according to their solid, liquid, or
        gaseous state, not on the results of their reciprocal actions. </p>
      <p>The early physicists regarded the problem in a much simpler
        way. For them it was a fluid impregnating all bodies and
        disengaging itself by combustion. This theory, called the
        phlogistic, was much shaken when Lavoisier proved that, far from
        losing weight by combustion, bodies on the contrary gained it.
        Yet at the time of Carnot, heat was still considered to be a
        fluid that bodies could part with or absorb, and only differing
        from the old phlogiston by its imponderability. </p>
      <p>In the long run physicists gave up the idea of a caloric fluid;
        but after taking infinite trouble, for more than 50 years, to
        substitute the mechanical theory of heat produced by movement
        for that of the conception of a fluid, they seem now -- in a
        rather roundabout way -- about to return to the latter. As Prof
        de Heen has very justly remarked, "The old idea of mixing the
        phlogistic fluid with matter is identical with the one currently
        accepted, which consists in mixing with matter electric
        corpuscles". There is as much reason for imagining atoms of heat
        as there is for imagining atoms of electricity. </p>
      <p>The ancient idea that heat was a kind of fluid has been very
        fertile. Without it, Sadi Carnot would, perhaps, never have
        thought of comparing the flow of heat to that of a liquid, and,
        no doubt, would never have discovered the principle which bears
        his name and has so deeply modified the direction of the
        sciences of physics and chemistry. </p>
      <p>It must be fully recognized, moreover, that if physicists and
        chemists reject the idea of assimilating heat to a fluid, they
        nearly always treat it as if it really were one. Chemists
        constantly speak of heat as absorbed or liberated by a body.
        According to them, when a combination is formed it should keep
        this heat indefinitely until it is destroyed. It then gives it
        up in quantity exactly equal to that absorbed. Physicists, for
        their part, tell us that when a body is heated it absorbed heat
        and restores it as it cools. We should express ourselves no
        otherwise if heat were really a fluid. </p>
      <p>The mathematicians themselves often employ similar language.
        All their formulas have been framed as if heat were constituted
        by a fluid. Laplace, Poisson, Lame, etc., assimilated caloric to
        an expansive fluid, and the temperature of the particles to the
        tension of the fluid in them. The variations of heat were
        explained by changes between&nbsp; these particles of caloric
        proportional to the difference of their respective temperatures.
        At the present day, when heat is considered to be a vibratory
        movement of the particles of matter, we often still continue to
        argue as if it were a fluid, of which it possesses, in fact,
        many of the properties. </p>
      <p>"The analogy existing between the propagation of heat in
        athermanous bodies and the filtration of fluids through porous
        masses is so close", writes M. Bousinesq in his <i>Theorie
          Analytique de la Chaleur</i>, "that we might seek to obtain
        from it a mechanical theory of conductivity if there were such a
        thing as a caloric fluid". </p>
      <p>We are not certain, moreover, that this fluid does not exist.
        Electrons are beginning to be made to play a great part in
        calorific phenomena. After having brought us back to the old
        electric fluid, they are perhaps going to revive the caloric
        fluid. For the moment our ignorance on this point is complete. </p>
      <p><b>2. Changes of State of Bodies Under the Influence of Heat
          and Variations of Energy Resulting Therefrom</b> </p>
      <p>The effects of heat on matter are of daily observation. The
        simple examination of the movements of the thermometer column
        shows that bodies dilate with heat and contract with cold. The
        sensitiveness of matter is such, that a variation in temperature
        of the millionth of a degree suffices to modify its electric
        resistance in a fashion appreciable by experiment. The slightest
        oscillation in the ether causes it to vibrate and radiate. There
        is thus a continuous exchange of energy between matter and the
        ether. </p>
      <p>It is no longer possible at the present day to consider matter
        independently of its surroundings. The variations of the latter
        regulate its equilibria and also its form, rendering it solid,
        liquid, or gaseous. Matter corresponds to a state of equilibrium
        between its internal energies and the external ones which
        surround it. </p>
      <p>The movements of rotation and of revolution of the elements of
        the atoms unceasingly vary under the action of heat. It modifies
        not only their speed of rotation, but also the diameters of the
        orbits traversed. When these increase, the particles of bodies
        move farther and farther apart, the molecular attractions which
        constitute cohesion are overcome, and matter passes first into
        the liquid, and then into the gaseous state. During these
        changes, bodies absorb determinate proportions of heat which
        they restore in absolutely equal quantity when they return to
        their primary state. The energy absorbed by matter being then
        exactly given back, we should be justified in believing that
        matter has never either created or destroyed it. </p>
      <p>Heat may, from the physical point of view, be defined as a mode
        of energy producing the change of volume of bodies, and
        therefore their dilation. This dilation represents an excellent
        means of measuring it, but the thermometer, which is based on
        this property, can only indicate a small part of the heat
        supplied to a body. When, for example, we heat matter to make it
        change its state -- that is, to liquefy it -- we produce three
        effects, of which only one is revealed by the thermometer: (1)
        we increase its temperature; (2) we change the internal
        disposition of its molecules -- that is to say, we affect an
        internal work which is not revealed by the thermometer; (3) we
        change its volume -- that is to say, we effect an external work
        against external pressure, which, again, is not revealed by the
        thermometer. It is therefore only a part of the heat produced
        which has served to change the temperature of the body. </p>
      <p>We can, on the other hand, cause the temperature of a body to
        vary without supplying or abstracting heat from it. This is
        observed in the operations called adiabatic, for instance, when
        a gas is compressed in a receptacle impermeable to heat. The
        temperature is increased by the transformation into heat of the
        work affected. </p>
      <p>The caloric energy necessary to compel bodies to change their
        state is considerable. To transform ice at 0° C into water at
        the same temperature, as much heat must be given it as would
        raise by one degree 80 times its weight of water, or 80
        calories. If the water again freezes, it restores the heat
        absorbed. To transform water at 100° C into steam of the same
        temperature, the necessary work is more considerable still,
        since this transformation requires 537 times as much heat as
        would raise the same quantity of water one degree. As before,
        these 537 calories are easily restored when the molecules draw
        together to pass again into the liquid state -- that is to say,
        when the steam at 100° C condenses into water likewise at 100°
        C. </p>
      <p>To show the magnitude of the energies thus displaced, Tyndall
        gives the following examples: -- The heat resulting from the
        combination of 1 kg of hydrogen with 8 kg of oxygen would raise
        by 1° C the temperature of 34,000 kg of water which corresponds
        to more than 14 million kilogram-meters. The condensation in
        water of the 9 kg of steam formed by this combination,
        represents a work of more than 2 million kilogram-meters. If, by
        continuing to run down this scale we bring the water to the
        solid state by lowering its temperature, it would still produce
        more than 700,000 kilogram-meters. </p>
      <p>The figures representing the forces necessary to modify the
        molecular states are evidently considerable when judged by our
        usual units of energy, but they are immensely feeble compared
        with the intra-atomic forces of which we have elsewhere studies
        the magnitude. </p>
      <p>We must bear in mind from what precedes the constancy of the
        figures representing the caloric energy displaced in the
        different variations of the state of matter. That which it
        absorbs in order to pass from one state to another is always
        rigorously given back when it returns to its first state. There
        are, then, simple displacements of energy without destruction or
        creation. </p>
      <p>This fact, so constantly observed, seemed a very solid argument
        in favor not only of the conservation of energy, but also of the
        important notion that matter and energy are two very distinct
        things, the first coming as a support to the second, but never
        creating it. </p>
      <p>My readers know that these principles have been overthrown.
        Practically, however, the ancient notions retain all their
        values. For, if matter is an enormous reservoir of energy, and
        is able to disappear by transforming itself into energy, we do
        not yet know how to extract from it any but insignificant
        quantities of this last. </p>
      <p><b>3. Can Heat Serve as the Measure of All Forms of Energy?</b>
      </p>
      <p>In all the changes of state of bodies, we have spoken solely of
        the heat absorbed or liberated, without troubling ourselves
        about the other forms of energy. Formerly these were ignored,
        but the deeper study of the laws of electrolysis having shown
        that the majority of chemical changes are accompanied by the
        production of a rigidly constant quantity of electricity for
        each reaction, it follows that these reactions can be expressed
        in units of electricity quite as well as in units of heat. The
        tendency of the present day is to measure reactions by the
        quantity of electricity displaced rather than by the quantity of
        heat brought into play. The generation of heat and electricity
        proceeds by nearly parallel steps, so that we may ask ourselves
        whether these forces may not be secondary manifestations of
        unknown energies of which we only perceive the transformations.
        Chemical energy, for example, is perhaps as different from the
        electricity and the heat it generates as these last are from
        friction which can also generate them. </p>
      <p>Heat being very early known, and all forces appearing able to
        transform themselves into heat, it was natural to take it as the
        unit of measurement. When radiations are allowed to fall on an
        absorbent surface, we consider those equivalent which produce
        the same amount of heating. In this way the division of energy
        in the luminous spectrum has been studied. But it now appears
        that some very active energies can be manifested under other
        conditions than heat, and cannot, in consequence, be measured by
        it. The temperature becomes less and less as we advance towards
        the extreme ultraviolet in the solar spectrum, and ends by being
        so minute that it is only perceptible to instruments of
        excessive sensitiveness. If we confined ourselves to caloric
        measurements it might be said that energy is almost nil at this
        end of the spectrum. Now, it is, on the contrary,
        extraordinarily active, for it dissociates the most resisting
        bodies, and transforms them into a torrent of particles of the
        family of the cathode rays. </p>
      <p>There are therefore forms of energy which cannot be reduced to
        heat, and which in consequence heat cannot help us to measure.
        This very important point will certainly someday attract the
        attention of physicists. </p>
      <p><b>4. The Conception of the Absolute Zero</b> </p>
      <p>The movements of the particles of heated bodies are
        communicated to substances in contact with them, and cause their
        volume to change. It is on this fact that the thermometer is
        based. Plunged into a more or less heated medium, it indicates
        the difference of temperature between this medium and that of
        the melting of ice taken as zero during the graduation of the
        instrument. </p>
      <p>This zero is evidently a very arbitrary one, since we might
        have taken as the starting point of the graduation the point of
        fusion of any body whatever. All our zeros -- such as, for
        instance, that of electric tension -- are equally conventional
        starting points. </p>
      <p>Physicists, however, have for a long time been led to conceive
        for heat a zero which does indeed deserve the name of absolute
        which is given to it, since the bodies brought to this
        temperature would no longer retain any caloric energy. This
        conception was formed at the time when heat was considered a
        fluid. The temperature at which bodies would expel all their
        provision of this fluid constituted the absolute zero. </p>
      <p>The theoretic discussions enabling it to be fixed have been
        numerous. Laplace and Lavoisier placed the absolute zero between
        1500 C and 3000 C below melting ice. Dalton fixed it at 1500° C.
        The reasons for these different conclusions were, however, very
        unconvincing. </p>
      <p>Although it has been abandoned, the theory of the materiality
        of heat has continued to weigh on the minds of physicist.
        Considerations drawn from the study of thermodynamics have led
        Lord Kelvin to adopt for the absolute zero the figure of -273°
        C, already deduced from the consideration that, as gases
        contract by 1/273 of their volume per degree, at 273° below the
        ordinary zero they could contract no further. </p>
      <p>According to the conception of the absolute zero, bodies would
        at -173° C contain no more heat. If heat be only the consequence
        of the movements of the particles of matter, as is generally
        admitted, these movements would cease at absolute zero. With
        this cessation would also disappear, no doubt, the other forces,
        such as cohesion. One does not, then, very well see what would
        become of matter. Several physicists, however, at the present
        day consider the absolute zero as a theoretical and unattainable
        limit which is merely a datum for calculations. </p>
      <p>This theory is much earlier than the date of the discovery of
        the existence of intra-atomic energy. We may suppose, in
        strictness, that relatively weak intra-molecular energies may
        disappear at a certain temperature, but it is impossible to
        imagine the vanishing of intra-atomic energies. They are so
        considerable, in fact, that to annul them would require force
        immeasurably superior to any we have at our disposal. If by any
        means whatever, such as lowering of the temperature, we
        succeeded in profoundly disturbing the internal equilibria of
        the elements always in vibration and rotation, of the atoms of a
        fragment of matter, they would be disaggregated and would return
        to the ether. </p>
      <p>In this chapter, devoted to the study of heat, we have not had
        to trouble ourselves with the sensation designated by this term.
        "That which to our sensations is heat", says Locke, "is
        objectively only movement". The physicists study these
        movements, but without having yet succeeded in explaining them.
        Heat is a chapter of physics of which a few fragments are
        precise, but which is chiefly composed of uncertainties. We
        shall see the number of these increase when studying the
        relations of the movements of matter produced by heat with those
        ethereal ones which these movements generate. </p>

        <b><font size="+1">Transformation of Movements of Matter in
            Vibrations of the Ether -- Radiant Heat</font></b></center>
      <p><b>1. Nature of Radiant Heat -- Absorption and Transformation
          by Matter of the Vibrations of the Ether</b> </p>
      <p>The classic term of radiant heat is one of the most erroneous
        in physics, notwithstanding its apparent accuracy. If we draw
        near to a fire, it warms us; it therefore radiates something.
        What can this something be, if not heat? </p>
      <p>It took a very long time to discover that a heated body does
        not radiate anything resembling heat. It is now known that it
        produces vibration of the ether, which, in themselves, have no
        temperature, and that it warms us at a distance because the
        vibrations of the ether generated it by being affected by the
        molecules of the air or the bodies before it, generate heat.
        These vibrations are not heat, but simply a cause of heat, as is
        any movement whatever. </p>
      <p>This confusion of radiant heat with the heat of bodies, which
        the textbooks stillperpetuate, for a long time prevented us from
        recognizing the identity of radiant heat and light, formerly
        considered to be two different things. </p>
      <p>That which we call by the very improper name of radiant heat
        has for its sole origin the vibrations of the ether. These can
        produce heat when their movement is destroyed, as does a stone
        by its impact, but they do not possess, I repeat, any
        temperature of their own. This is easily proved by interposing a
        lens of ice in the path of a pencil of radiant heat. However
        intense the pencil may be, the lens is not melted, while a piece
        of metal placed in its focus will become incandescent. The ether
        having no temperature, and the ice being very transparent to its
        vibrations, they have passed through the ice without melting it.
        As the metal, on the other hand, stops these vibrations, it
        becomes incandescent by absorbing and immediately restoring them
        under the form of other vibrations, becoming in its turn a
        source of that radiant heat without temperature, the effects of
        which have just been pointed out. </p>
      <p>Since the vibrations o the ether, called by the name of radiant
        heat, can only produce heat after their absorption by a body, it
        is evident that in the celestial spaces, where an atmosphere
        like that surrounding the earth does not exist, an absolute cold
        must reign in the neighborhood of incandescent stars, such as
        the sun. The thermometer dipped into these spaces would,
        however, mark there a very high temperature, because it would
        intercept the vibrations of the ether. The temperature recorded
        by it would not be that of the ambient medium, but its own
        temperature. Ice would not melt, because it allows the
        vibrations of the ether to pass without stopping them. Metal
        would become incandescent, because it absorbs the same
        vibrations. </p>
      <p>Life is only possible on our globe by reason of the absorption
        of the vibrations of the ether by the atmosphere and the earth;
        if these last were transparent to them, a very intense cold
        would reign on the surface of our planet. </p>
      <p>All the chemical reactions which take place in the interior of
        vegetables, notably the transformation of carbonic acid into
        carbon, have their origin in this absorption. </p>
      <p>The vibrations of the ether when absorbed by a body may be
        retained by it, and become the origin of various chemical
        transformations. They are thus fixed until the time when, by
        decomposing the body -- that is to say, by bringing it back to
        its former state -- we make them reappear under the form of
        heat. We have here one proof the more of the intimate relations
        of the ether with the matter, and of the exchanges of energy of
        which it is the seat. </p>
      <p>If the vibrations of the ether absorbed by matter are not used
        in chemical transformations, they only raise the temperature of
        bodies, and disappear by radiation with a rapidity dependent on
        the structure of these bodies or of the substances with which
        they are covered. A vessel of polished metal loses its heat by
        slow degrees, and this is why we employ it to keep liquids at a
        high temperature. The same metal, if covered with lacquer, on
        the other hand, rapidly parts with its heat. These are facts
        long known, which Lister in other days put in evidence by his
        cube full of boiling water, the faces of which were composed of
        different metals. Each face radiated different quantities of
        heat. </p>
      <p>All these facts find a rudimentary explanation in the
        phenomenon of acoustic resonance. A tuning fork insensible to
        the most violent noise will vibrate if struck by sound waves of
        suitable periods. It will even be able to pick out these sound
        waves from a mixture of very dissimilar sounds. It is therefore
        sensitive to some and insensitive to others. It is the same with
        bodies struck by radiant heat. They only absorb certain
        vibrations and let others pass by them. I shall return to this
        point in the next chapter. </p>
      <p><b>2. Permanence of the Radiation of Matter</b> </p>
      <p>Until the absolute zero is reached, matter unceasingly sends
        vibrations into the ether. A block of ice may therefore be
        considered as much a source of heat, and for the same reasons,
        as a fragment of glowing coal. The only difference between them
        is in the quantity radiated. The frozen plains of the Pole are a
        source of radiant heat like the burning plains of the Equator,
        and if the sensitiveness of the photographic plate were not so
        limited, it would be possible in the very darkest night to
        reproduce images of bodies by their own radiations, when
        refracted by the lenses of a camera obscura. </p>
      <p>Naturally, these radiations, which all bodies constantly emit,
        only act on the thermometer when it is plunged into a medium
        colder than itself. If the instrument is first placed in a
        refrigerating mixture, capable of lowering the column of liquid
        to a level corresponding to -50° C, and then placed in front of
        a block of ice at 0° C, the heat radiated by this block will
        raise by 50° -- that is to say, will bring back to zero -- the
        temperature of the instrument. But if this last already marks
        zero -- evidently no movement of the column of liquid can reveal
        the radiation. The ice would continue&nbsp; radiating on the
        thermometer and the later on to the ice, but they would only be
        exchanging their radiations. The radiation would therefore
        nonetheless go on, though marked by this exchange. When we say
        that a body becomes cool by radiation, we necessarily imply that
        it is plunged into a medium with a lower temperature than its
        own. Receiving from the latter less heat then it imparts to it,
        its temperature is lowered until that of the two bodies is
        equal. </p>
      <p>When we are obliged to keep at a low temperature a body which
        is to be placed in a medium of higher temperature, we surround
        it with substances impermeable to radiation, and thence called
        athermanous. Wool and furs possess this property. Pictet has
        shown that for temperatures below -70 C the majority of
        athermanous bodies lose their properties and become
        diathermanous. We can only keep air liquid by enclosing it in
        double-walled vessels, between the walls of which a vacuum is
        made, and the inner surface of which is silvered [Dewar flask].
        These vessels can also be used to keep liquids very hot, since
        they prevent the absorption as well as the emission of
        radiation. </p>
      <p><b>3. The Electric Emissions Which Accompany Heat</b> </p>
      <p>We have just seen that matter is always absorbing and
        radiating. The exchange between it and the ether never ceases.
        The vibrations of the ether intercepted by matter are subjected
        by it to various transformation of a mechanism unknown to us,
        and of which we only perceive the extreme terms. </p>
      <p>I have never ceased to insist in this and my preceding work on
        the relations of the ether with mater. They again appear when we
        examine the electric phenomena accompanying the caloric
        variations of bodies. </p>
      <p>Physicists have had for a long time an inkling of the kinship
        between heat and electricity, and recognize more and more that
        the production of the one is accompanied by the simultaneous
        manifestation of the other. A body which is subjected to
        friction generates both heat and electricity. The heat which is
        propagated throughout a wire by the simple twisting of it on
        itself, generates electricity. A substance which liberates heat
        when combining with another, liberates electricity at the same
        time. </p>
      <p>It is known also that the electric and caloric
        conductivities&nbsp; are sensibly in the same ratios for all
        metals. Those which are good conductors of heat are the same for
        electricity, and conversely. The chief difference lies in the
        speed of propagation. Immense in the case of electricity, this
        is, on the contrary, very slow in that of heat. </p>
      <p>If heat easily transforms itself into electricity, the latter
        no less easily transforms itself into heat. It suffices to pass
        a current through a metal wire to see the latter become more or
        less red-hot according to its resistance. If a current be sent
        through a conducting wire half platinum and the other half
        silver, the platinum becomes white-hot, while the silver wire, a
        tenfold better conductor -- that is to say, offering less
        resistance to the passage of the electricity -- remains dark. </p>
      <p>The recent researched mentioned in my last book make it
        possible to follow much further the course of this analysis. We
        now know that when, by one means or the other, a body is made
        incandescent, it emits not only radiant heat and light -- which
        are, moreover, exactly the same thing --but, in addition,
        torrents of electric particles. We have even reached the point
        of admitting -- an hypothesis which the experiments of Zeeman
        seem to confirm -- that a flame consists only of electric
        particles in vibration. The movements of these electrons,
        propagated in the ether, would generate radiant heat and light.
        It is, however, very possible that the liberation of electric
        particles which accompany incandescence and many other chemical
        reactions, is only in many cases a secondary phenomenon, a king
        of unutilized excess of energies employed in modifying the
        equilibria of matter. </p>
      <p>A constant relation ought to exist between the intra-molecular
        and intra-atomic energies. Atoms represent the stones of which
        the molecular edifices are built. In all the operations of
        ordinary chemistry, we simply displace these stones, and this
        is, no doubt, why the quantities of heat or electricity then
        brought into play are always met with again. When by various
        means, very inadequate as yet, we touch the structure of the
        stones of the edifice -- that is to say, of the atoms -- we
        liberate, in the form of heat, or electricity, quantities of
        intra-atomic forces of which the magnitude will vary according
        to the disturbances of equilibrium produced, and may bear no
        relation to the causes of such changes. </p>
      <p>The whole of this and the preceding chapter are, if looked upon
        as explanations, evidently insufficient. Notwithstanding all the
        formulas with which it bristles, this region of physics is
        extremely obscure. The problem of heat is one of the most
        difficult, because its solution demands the knowledge of things
        which are as yet very difficult of access. </p>

        <b><font size="+1">Transformation of Matter into Light</font></b></center>
      <p><b>1. The Emission of Light by Matter</b> </p>
      <p>Light is produced by vibrations of matter propagated under the
        form of waves in the ether. When these waves possess a length
        suitable for impressing the eye, we give them the name of
        visible light. We call them invisible when the retina, which is
        only impressed by a small part of the whole extent of the solar
        spectrum, remains insensitive to their action. </p>
      <p>Whether it is the vibrations producing the sensation of blue or
        red, or those which are without action on the eye, such as
        infrared or the ultraviolet, that are in question, they are all
        of the same species, only differ by their frequency, and all
        deserve the name of light. From this general definition there
        springs a first consequence. We ought to give the name of light
        to the visible or invisible radiations emitted by matter at all
        temperatures down to the absolute zero as we have seen when
        studying radiant heat. </p>
      <p>Matter, then, is incessantly transformed into light at all
        temperatures. An eye with a retina sensitive enough would see in
        the dark all objects as if surrounded by a luminous halo, and
        darkness would be unknown to it. Such an eye perhaps does not
        exist, but different instruments allow us to make a substitute
        for it. </p>
      <p>Let us examine some of the conditions of the transformation of
        matter into light. </p>
      <p>When we heat a body, the vibrations of its particles become
        more rapid, and its emission of ethereal waves increases. These
        waves, at first too long to be perceived, as they get near 500°
        C are short enough to become visible and to give the sensation
        of red. From 800° to 1000° C still shorter waves appear, and the
        radiations emitted comprise the whole length of the spectrum.
        Their slight amplitude alone prevents us from perceiving them.
        Temperature acts especially by increasing the amplitude of the
        waves emitted, which renders them visible. </p>
      <p>At each temperature, the heated body emits waves different in
        length according to its nature. The brilliancy of flames
        depending at equal temperatures on the ratio between the long
        and short waves emitted by the incandescent body, those sources
        of light which emit many more of the second than of the first
        will be the more luminous. The brilliancy of the Auer mantle is
        due to the weakness of its emissive power in the red and the
        infrared compared to its power of emission in the visible
        spectrum. The temperature (about 1650° to 1700° C) does not in
        this case differ notable from that of a simple gas burner. </p>
      <p>As regards the brilliancy of the light, there would be no
        advantage in raising too much the temperature of a body, because
        we should then produce, as is the ease with the electric arc,
        invisible ultraviolet rays. The more, in fact, the temperature
        of a source of light is raised, the more the radiations it emits
        are displaced towards the ultraviolet. </p>
      <p>The radiation of bodies generated by heating is produced by all
        actions capable of increasing their vibrations, especially those
        chemical reactions which furnished the early modes of lighting.
        As a type, we may quote the combustion of ordinary gas. Formed
        by a mixture of hydrogen and of carbides of hydrogen, it
        combines violently with the oxygen of the air when lighted. The
        particles of carbon from the carbide, being liberated and
        brought to incandescence, give the flame a brilliancy which pure
        hydrogen does not possess. Gas therefore owes its brilliancy to
        these incandescent particles held in suspension. Any solid body
        whatever -- platinum, for example -- might replace the particles
        of carbon. </p>
      <p>In reality, the phenomena which takes place in any kind of
        flame -- that of a simple candle, for example -- are quite
        otherwise complicated. So much is this the case that we might
        consider a body in combustion, such as a lighted candle, as one
        of the phenomena in physics most difficult of explanation, and
        involving the solution, of which we have yet hardly a glimpse,
        of the problems relating to the dissociation of matter. All
        incandescence is accompanied, in fact, by the liberation of a
        torrent of electric particles comparable to the cathode rays or
        the emissions of radium. This liberation necessarily implies a
        commencement of that disaggregation of the atom which was
        formerly ignored, because the provision of energy contained in
        matter is so immense that the loss of it during combustion then
        passed unperceived. </p>
      <p>This dissociation of the atom in a flame has been made apparent
        not only by the production of electric particles proceeding from
        this dissociation, but likewise by the deviation of the
        electrons of flames by a magnetic field; it has as its
        consequence the doubling of the spectral rays if the flame acted
        on by the magnetic field. </p>
      <p><b>2. The Influence of Wavelength and Amplitude on the Action
          of Light</b> </p>
      <p>A body thrown into the water produces on its surface a series
        of concentric circular waves comparable to small parallel hills
        separated by valleys. The distance from the top of one hill to
        another is what is called the wavelength; the height of each
        hill from the bottom of the valley represents the amplitude of
        the wave. It is the same with light, the sole difference being
        that the undulations take place in the ether instead of being
        produced in a liquid. </p>
      <p>The length of the wave and its height constitute two very
        different things which we must keep distinct if we wish to
        understand certain actions of light. </p>
      <p>Whether it is a question of sound or of light, or of any
        periodical disturbance of any fluid whatever, the wavelength is
        an element of invariable magnitude during the whole period of a
        vibration, while its amplitude may vary within wide limits.
        Waves lose their amplitude by propagation, but their length, and
        consequently the number of vibrations per second, remain the
        same. The analogy with the oscillation of a pendulum is
        complete. Move a pendulum much or little from the vertical line,
        and the distance it travels in its oscillating trajectory may be
        very short or very long, but the time taken to effect it will be
        invariable, and will depend solely on the length of the
        pendulum. </p>
      <p>What is the part played by these two elements, wavelength and
        amplitude? In the case of the pendulum, the vis viva [kinetic
        energy] of its waves increases with the amplitude of its
        vibrations. As regards sound, it is the wavelength that
        determines the pitch of a given note, while the amplitude
        determines the intensity of this note. </p>
      <p>With light the undulation of the ether give, according to their
        length, notes which we call blue, red, green, etc. Their length
        is strictly invariable for each note; but their intensity may
        vary enormously with the amplitude of the waves emitted -- from
        1 to 1 million between 600° and 1800° C, for instance, in the
        case of red radiations according to the measurements of M.
        Lechatelier. The intensity of a radiation will make it oscillate
        between darkness and a blinding flash, without the wavelength
        undergoing any change. </p>
      <p>Besides the temperature, there are different means of
        increasing or decreasing the amplitude of the ethereal waves,
        and consequently the intensity of a pencil of light. To do so,
        it is enough to concentrate or, on the contrary, to disperse it,
        by lenses of suitable form. The intensity of a note or of a
        color is then very variable, but the length of the waves which
        produce this note or color remains absolutely the same during
        the whole period of the vibrations. </p>
      <p>The eye and the ear are not organized so as to accumulate
        impressions. A color or a note of a given intensity will always
        produce the same effect, whatever the duration of their action.
        It is otherwise for certain reagents -- the photographic plate,
        for instance -- capable of accumulating impressions. We can
        thus, with a very slight but prolonged intensity, produce
        effects identical with those obtained with a very great
        intensity, acting for a very short time. It is the possibility
        of this accumulation which enables us to photograph bodies
        having a phosphorescence invisible to the eye, simply because
        the amplitude of the vibrations of light emitted was too slight
        to impress the retina. </p>
      <p>The sensitive plate sees the radiations emitted because it can
        accumulate them, and photographs stars which the eye does not
        see by reason of their too slight amplitude, although the
        sensitiveness of the retina is enormously superior to that of
        the plate. The eye is for light what the ear is for sound. There
        exist dark light and silent sound, which the eye and ear do not
        perceive, but which suitable reagents may reveal. </p>
      <p>From the fact that those stars which are on the edge of
        visibility take an hour’s exposure to photograph, Deslandres
        remarks that "the relation between the sensitiveness of the eye
        and that of the photographic plate should be the ratio of 1/10
        second and 1 hour, or (say) 1/40,000". </p>
      <p>Whatever be the reagent employed -- retina, photographic plate,
        or chemical compound -- there is always a minimum of amplitude
        variable in each, below which light has no action. Berthelot
        pointed out, for example, that the oxidation of bisulfide of
        carbon, which in the sunlight can be effected in a few hours, is
        never effected in diffused light, even in a year’s time. For
        other reactions, such as the combinations of chlorine and
        hydrogen, the intensity of light may, on the other hand, be
        extremely slight. These are phenomena which are not always taken
        into account, but which must be known in order to understand the
        effects of light. It is because they have been misunderstood
        that the variations of certain vegetable functions in the
        different regions of the spectrum have given rise, as we shall
        see, to so many contradictory interpretations. </p>
      <p><b>3. The Invisible Spectrum</b> </p>
      <p>The researches effected during recent years have proved that
        the invisible solar spectrum is much more extended than the
        visible. While this last only reaches from 0.4 to 0.8 microns,
        the invisible spectrum goes a little beyond 5 microns according
        to Langley [who used a bolometer] -- that is to say, it is about
        12 times as long as the other. The invisible spectrum of
        artificial sources of light is more extended still, since,
        according to Rubens, it stretches as far as 60 microns. </p>
      <p>The plates of the solar spectrum published in textbooks give a
        very false idea of it, Not only do they reproduce nothing but
        the visible region, but the distribution of the color in it is
        very inexact, inasmuch as the prismatic spectra used as models
        reduce to a fourth or a fifth of its real size the extent of the
        red, and much exaggerate that of the violet rays. </p>
      <p><b>Figure 14</b> </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="1fig14.jpg" height="151" width="364"></p>
      </center>
      <p>The distribution of the colors is only exact with the
        diffraction spectra obtained by means of gratings. The distance
        between the rays then being proportionate to the wavelength, the
        red occupies a much more considerable extent than in the spectra
        obtained with a prism. </p>
      <p>It was in fact the employment of prisms for the production of
        spectra which led us to interpret inaccurately the position of
        the maximum of caloric energy. It was formerly placed in the
        infrared. We now know that it is found in the luminous part of
        the spectrum. But as, in comparison with the total length of
        this last, the visible region is of very small extent, it
        follows that the total caloric energy is much greater in the
        invisible infrared. According to the last measurements of
        Langley, the visible solar spectrum only contains one-fifth part
        of the caloric energy of the infrared region. The invisible
        region of the spectrum constitutes, then, the most important
        portion of light. It is only the sensitiveness of the human eye
        which creates the division between the visible and the invisible
        parts of the spectrum. It is not, doubtless, the same with all
        animals. </p>
      <p>This immense invisible region of the spectrum, wherein is found
        the greatest part of its energy, ought to play a very important,
        though hardly suspected, part in the phenomena of vegetable life
        and in meteorology. We as yet know none of its properties except
        the caloric action. Its variations probably have considerable
        effect in the changes of the seasons. Langley has recognized
        that the solar spectrum changes at the different periods of the
        year, and that the distribution of its energy is not the same at
        different seasons. </p>
      <p>The one-fifth of the solar radiation which appears under the
        form of visible light seems at first a very small proportion of
        the whole. It is in reality very great if we compare it with
        that of artificial light. According to Wedding’s latest
        researches (1905) all artificial sources of light, including the
        electric arc, utilize hardly 1 percent of the radiations
        produced. </p>
      <p><b>Figure 15</b> </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="1fig15.jpg" height="153" width="340"></p>
      </center>
      <p>99% of the radiations emitted are, then, invisible. </p>
      <p>Although these figures vary with the observers, none of them
        have found a less loss than 90%. If, then, we estimate at 4
        million pounds, as has been done, the annual expenditure on
        artificial light of a great country like England, we shall see
        that the discovery of a means of transforming the invisible
        caloric energy into visible light would effect a saving of
        nearly 3 million pounds a year for one country alone. </p>
      <p>The problem does not appear at all insoluble, since nature has
        already found the solution of it. The light of phosphorescent
        animals is almost exclusively composed of rays belonging to the
        visible region of the spectrum. All phosphorescent bodies also
        produce light without previous heating. It is probable that in
        this case, then, it is the energies of the atoms and not the
        disturbances of the molecules -- as in the case of incandescence
        -- which come into play. We will return to this point when
        studying, in a future chapter, the phosphorescence of gases. </p>
      <p><b>4. The Distribution of Energy Throughout the Spectrum</b> </p>
      <p>The distribution of energy in the various regions of the
        spectrum has been the object of numerous researches. They have
        not led, however, to any very useful results, for the simple
        reason that, at a uniform temperature, the intensity of the
        various radiations varies greatly according to the source of
        light. We have seen, for example, that the distribution in the
        spectrum of a gas burner and in that of an Auer mantle was very
        different, although their temperature was almost identical. </p>
      <p>Nor is there any profit to be drawn from the published
        researches on the distribution of energy in the solar spectrum,
        by reason of the very great variation which takes place in the
        infrared according to the days, the hours, the attitude, and the
        absorption exercised by the greater or less quantity of water
        vapor in the atmosphere, etc. </p>
      <p>All the early measurements of the energy of the spectrum were,
        moreover, affected by errors due to the employment of the prism
        to separate the various radiations. As the prism heaps together
        the radiations in the infrared, and spreads them out
        considerably at the other end of the spectrum, it was natural
        that the heat should be very great in the part where the
        radiations were most condensed. We therefore supposed that in
        the infrared was to be found the hottest part of the solar
        spectrum. This error and the curve which represents it still
        figure in most elementary treatises on physics. </p>
      <p>As soon as we succeeded, by means of gratings, in producing
        spectra in which the deviation of the radiations is proportional
        to the wavelength, it became evident that it was not in the
        invisible infrared, but in the most luminous part of the
        spectrum, that is from A to D, that the maximum of caloric
        action in the light of the sun is to be found. </p>
      <p>No part of the spectrum is really devoid of caloric action, as
        physicists for a long time believed. It would suffice to give to
        any radiation sufficient intensity to cause it to produce any
        caloric action one could desire. </p>
      <p>Independently of the causes of error just enumerated, there is
        one much more serious still, which is connected with the very
        principle of the materials used. </p>
      <p>Physicists were led to measure the energy of the spectrum
        solely by the evaluation of the caloric notion of its different
        parts. M. Jamin (<i>Physique</i>, 4th edition, t. iii, p. 160)
        shows in the following passage the mental process involved in
        that conception: -- </p>
      <p>"It was formerly supposed that three distinct agents emanated
        from the sun -- heat, light and the chemical rays -- and that
        each of these gave rise to a spectrum partially superposed upon
        the two others, but as distinct in its nature as in its
        properties. But we have been led by the force of events to
        reject this complicated hypothesis, because all experiments
        proved powerless to realize in practice the separation supposed
        to be possible in theory. Everybody now admits that the sun
        sends us vibrations, which are all of the same nature, and which
        are only distinguished from each other by their wavelengths.
        These different actions (luminous, chemical, and caloric) are
        all executed at the expense of the energy of the vibrations, but
        the caloric action supplies the only rational measurement of
        them". </p>
      <p>This mode of measurement was applied not only to light, but to
        all forms of energy. It is deduced from the idea that all the
        modes of energy, being capable of transformation into heat, are
        measurable by their caloric effects evaluated in calories or
        kilogram-meters, which are consequently their equivalents. </p>
      <p>By considering in the spectrum nothing but heat, we were
        naturally led to attribute to it all the actions observed. This
        is exactly what the last-quoted author did. "It is at the
        expense of the calorific energy of which the radiations can
        dispose", he says, "that the impression of light on the eye and
        that on the photographic plate are alike produced". If it were
        really so, the rays which can produce the maximum of heat ought
        to be those which can best act on the photographic plate and on
        the eye. Now, it is just the contrary which is the case. It is
        not only in the photographic action that we notice this want of
        parallelism between the caloric intensity and the effects
        observed. It is really striking to see produced in very
        energetic fashion, in the ultraviolet, the caloric action of
        which is almost nil, certain effects, such as the dissociation
        of matter, while they are insignificant in the hotter parts of
        the spectrum. </p>
      <p>We ought to conclude from this, that the various regions of the
        spectrum possess actions having no common measure. According to
        the reagent employed -- the eye, the photographic plate, the
        thermometer, the electrometer -- the distribution of energy will
        be very different. The reagents strongly impressed by a certain
        radiation are silent to another. </p>
      <p>In reality, a curve is required for each of them, and it must
        not be claimed that the energy of the spectrum can be determined
        by a single one, as has hitherto been done. </p>
      <p><b>5. The Absorption of Light by Matter</b> </p>
      <p>To its property of emitting luminous rays, matter adds that of
        being able to absorb them or to allow them to pass through it.
        There is thus a permanent interchange between matter and the
        ether, as I have already pointed out. </p>
      <p>When a body allows light to pass through itself it is called
        transparent. In the contrary case, it is called opaque. </p>
      <p>Our ideas as to transparency and opacity have been much
        modified during the last few years. It is known at the present
        day that there is no body entirely transparent to all
        radiations. A strip of glass one-tenth of a millimeter thick,
        completely transparent to the eye, is yet absolutely opaque for
        the whole ultraviolet extremity of the spectrum and for a
        notable part of the infrared. </p>
      <p>Transparency is always selective and, consequently, never
        complete. If there existed a body entirely transparent, it could
        be exposed to the most intense source of heat without becoming
        warm, since it would not absorb any radiation. The rise in
        temperature of a body exposed to a radiation is only due, in
        fact, to the absorption of it of those radiations which have no
        temperature of their own. </p>
      <p>The greater the opaqueness of a body the more it absorbs and
        the more it becomes heated, except, naturally, in cases where,
        through the polish of its surface, it sends back into space the
        vibrations of the ether which reach it. </p>
      <p>We now attempt, as said before, to explain the transparency and
        opacity of bodies by a phenomenon resembling that of acoustic
        resonance. A slight modification of the current theory will
        suffice to show that these phenomena are the consequences of the
        same law. Matter may be considered to be composed of small
        molecular tuning forks capable, like ordinary ones, of vibrating
        to certain notes, but not to others. When struck by the
        vibrations of the ether, they vibrate according to their
        structure, in unison with certain vibrations and receive no
        impressions from the others. The radiation which causes them to
        vibrate remains, in issuing from the transparent body, exactly
        the same as when it entered, having undergone, in the case of
        other modifications, only a slackening of speed, in consequence,
        no doubt, of the time necessary to increase the vibrations of
        the atoms. </p>
      <p>Opaque bodies must, on the contrary, be formed of elements
        unable to vibrate in unison with the vibrations which strike
        them. They can, then, only emit irregular vibrations which
        vanish at once by transmitting themselves to the neighboring
        molecules. From these movements must result the heating of
        bodies struck by light. Absorption would be, then an absolute
        transfer of the movement of the ether to the bodies which are
        plunged therein. </p>
      <p>When a substance is transparent to one radiation and opaque to
        another -- which is the general case -- the molecules vibrate in
        unison with the vibrations which pass through them and absorb
        others. A red or blue glass possesses its color because it can
        only allow the radiations of the spectrum corresponding to the
        blue or red to pass and can keep back the others. </p>
      <p>This theory of resonance is only maintainable if we suppose the
        molecules of bodies to be already animated by rapid movements to
        which the vibrations of the ether do but impart direction. It
        would be, otherwise, quite impossible to suppose that the
        vibrations of the ether could give to the atoms the enormous
        total of energy necessary to cause them to oscillate with the
        rapidity of light. </p>
      <p>According to this theory, the only difference between a
        transparent and an opaque body rests on the nature of the
        vibrations they each emit. The vibrations falling upon them pass
        through the transparent body, and cause in their passage the
        atoms of matter to vibrate with the incident ray. They would
        equally cause the atoms of the opaque body to vibrate, but would
        diffuse themselves throughout its mass. In both cases the
        luminous energy, having struck the face of an opaque or a
        transparent plate, necessarily reappears on the other side. In
        the case of transparency, the ray on issuing is the same as on
        entering; in the case of opacity, the plate is heated, and then
        emits in all directions -- and no longer in one single direction
        -- radiations with a wavelength greatly differing from that
        which struck the other side. While the light does not modify the
        temperature of a transparent body, it raises, on the contrary,
        that of an opaque one. </p>
      <p>If the amplitude of the luminous waves striking an opaque body
        be great enough, the molecules of this body may be driven
        sufficiently apart to cause it to pass into the liquid or
        gaseous state. </p>
      <p>The absorption of light by matter is closely connected with the
        structure of this last. The modifications produces by its
        changes enable the composition of bodies to be ascertained. They
        are easily noticed by interposing the substance it is desired to
        examine between a luminous source and the prism of a
        spectroscope. Many liquids very transparent to the eye present
        bands of absorption which vary with the slightest changes in
        their composition. Traces of impurity are thus easily discerned.
        It is possible, for instance, to detect the presence of 1/50,000
        part of pyridine in ammonia. </p>
      <p>Gases are very absorbent for certain radiations, and very
        little so for others. He gases of the atmosphere totally absorb
        all the ultraviolet starting from 0.295 microns, and all the
        infrared beyond 5 microns. The ozone of the atmosphere also
        shows itself very absorbent for the ultraviolet, and the
        accidental disappearance of this region from the line M onwards,
        observed in my experiments, is perhaps due to the momentary
        excess of this substance. </p>
      <p>It is somewhat difficult in the theory of transparency by
        resonance, given above, to understand how the same body can be
        transparent or opaque to regions situated at the extremities of
        the spectrum. Window glass is quite opaque, not only to the
        ultraviolet, but likewise to all the infrared region beyond 2 to
        3 microns, and consequently to the caloric radiations emitted by
        bodies heated to 100 C or less. </p>
      <p>This partial transparency of matter to the luminous vibrations
        of the ether should be compared with its complete transparency
        to the electric or magnetic lines of force pointed out
        previously, which are also composed of ether, but in a form
        unknown to us. They are the only elements of which matter is
        unable to stay the progress. Why does it allow the ether to pass
        in one form and not in another? I can give no answer to this
        question. </p>
      <p><b>6. The Chemical and Photographic Action of Light</b> </p>
      <p>When the vibrations of the ether produced by the heating of
        matter meet a body, they produce varied effects, which we may
        divide into three classes. </p>
      <p>1. Mechanical Action ~ This is the pressure exercised by
        radiant energy. Being very slight, it can only be made evident
        by very sensitive instruments. It may, however, be sufficiently
        intense to annul gravity in the case of very light bodies. The
        deformation of comets is attributed to its influence. </p>
      <p>2. Dissociating Action on the Atoms of Matter ~ This is put in
        evidence by the researches set forth in my former work, to which
        I shall return in a later chapter. </p>
      <p>3. Chemical Actions ~ Comprise very different reactions
        (oxidation, reduction, etc) made use of in photography. </p>
      <p>Of these different actions, I shall now only study certain
        particular effects with regard to photography which have been
        observed in the course of my researches. </p>
      <p>It being conceded that the electric particles of the cathode
        rays and of radioactive bodies impress photographic plates, we
        might be tempted to ascribe the formation of the latent image to
        a kind of ionization of the gelatino-bromide of silver. I
        formerly thought of maintaining this hypothesis, but there are
        the two following facts against it: (1) It is impossible to
        observe any radioactivity during the exposure of the
        photographic plate to the light; (2) the blue rays which chiefly
        act on the photographic plate are by no means the most active
        agents in the dissociation of matter. </p>
      <p>The elucidation of this last point led me to inquire which were
        the radiations with the greatest action on the photographic
        impression. </p>
      <p>In order to make these evident I exposed a photographic plate
        behind a spectroscope, and watched in which region the
        impression commenced. It always began in the blue, and never in
        the violet or the ultraviolet. </p>
      <p><b>Figure 16</b> </p>

        <p><img src="1fig16.jpg" height="371" width="469"></p>
      </center>
      <p>Although the Jena-glass prisms of my spectroscopes allow nearly
        all the solar ultraviolet to pass, they absorb, however, a
        portion, and it might be objected to the above experiments that
        the feeble action of the violet and the ultraviolet was the
        result of this absorption. I therefore asked M. de Watteville,
        who owns a large spectroscope with a quartz prism, very
        transparent to ultraviolet rays, to repeat my experiments with
        his instrument. They gave results identical to those set forth
        above. The impression always begins in the blue, and is only
        propagated some time afterwards into the ultraviolet. It may be
        gathered from this that the use of objectives of quartz or of
        glass very transparent to the ultraviolet would offer absolutely
        no advantage in instantaneous photography. </p>
      <p>It would be much more interesting to increase the sensitiveness
        of the plates for all regions of the spectrum. The part utilized
        in photography hardly represents more than about the 20th part
        of the solar spectrum, which goes from 5 microns to 0.295
        microns, including the visible and invisible rays. The visible
        part only extends from 0.4 to 0.8 microns. Even if we only take
        note of the visible spectrum, it will be seen that the
        photographic plate utilizes but a very small part of it. </p>
      <p>No doubt, by various means, we can render the plates fairly
        sensitive as far as the red; but this sensitiveness is very
        illusory, for enormous differences of exposure are always
        required to obtain images with blue, green, and red light. The
        only real advantage of the pates termed monochromatic is that
        they are less sensitive to the blue than ordinary plates. The
        same result is obtained by simply placing a yellow glass before
        the objective. With any plate whatever we obtain an impression
        as intense as can be desired by sufficiently prolonging the
        exposure. A landscape may very well be photographed through a
        red glass. </p>
      <p><b>Figure 17 / 18 / 19 / 20 ~</b> </p>

        <p><img src="1fig1720.jpg" height="471" width="417"></p>
      </center>
      <p>It is this difference of rapidity of action in the different
        luminous radiations which changes all the values in the
        photographic reproduction of landscapes. We obviate these
        differences somewhat by prolonging the exposure so as to allow
        the feebly actinic rays time to act, but then soon comes in the
        phenomenon of irradiation consisting in the fact that every part
        impressed acts as a luminous center on the neighboring region,
        not only directly, but by its reflection on the posterior of the
        glass. I have made not a few experiments on this subject, and
        have observed that with sufficiently long exposures the
        impression can be propagated to within half a centimeter of the
        region reached by the light. It is for this reason that the
        photography of very fine lines is very difficult. Vain attempts
        have been made to thus reproduce by photography the diamond-cut
        gratings employed in certain processes. </p>
      <p>I will sum up for my photographer readers the experiments that
        I have carried out&nbsp; -- with the spectroscope described in
        another chapter -- for the examination of those regions of the
        spectrum which impress photographic plates according to the
        length of exposure, the nature of the plates employed, and the
        colored glasses placed before the objective. </p>
      <p>Parts of the Solar Spectrum utilized in photography according
        to the length of exposure with ordinary and with orthochromatic
        plates (Cf. Figure 16) </p>
      <p>(1) Ordinary rapid plates: Instantaneous exposure -- The
        impression extends from F to the middle of the interval between
        H and G; 2-seconds exposure -- The image extends up to K on one
        side, and nearly to E on the other; 15-seconds exposure --The
        impression is prolonged beyond L on the side of the ultraviolet,
        and extends nearly up to D on the side of the red. </p>
      <p>It is, then, sufficient to expose an ordinary plate long enough
        for it to be impressed by the least actinic rays. In proportion
        as the exposure is lengthened, the intensity of the impression
        increases between H and E, and much less rapidly from E to A. We
        then have a plate over-exposed for the blue, and hardly enough
        so for the other colors. </p>
      <p>Influence of a colored glass -- A blue glass reduces but very
        feebly the image during instantaneous exposures even with the
        ultraviolet region. A yellow glass does not reduce the intensity
        of the image on the side of the red, but does so on the side of
        the blue, <i>i.e.</i>, from H to the ultraviolet. If instead of
        1 second’s exposure we give it 30 seconds, all the colors
        impress the plate, and, moreover, as the action of the blue is
        much extended, the unevenness of the impression is diminished.
        In photography therefore, as soon as one has to prolong the
        exposure, a dark yellow glass should be put in front of the
        objective. The best orthochromatic plate is an ordinary one with
        a yellow glass. A green glass would further reduce the
        impression on the side of the blue, but its use would only be of
        advantage with a too prolonged exposure. </p>
      <p>(2) So-called orthochromatic plates: The substances with which
        these plates are covered render them much less sensitive to the
        blue rays than ordinary plates. Their sensitiveness extends from
        a little on the side of the red to beyond D, but without in any
        way attaining the ray A save with an exaggerated exposure. These
        plates behave in reality like an ordinary plate before which one
        has placed a yellow glass, but are very inferior to it. </p>
      <p>They are very little sensitive in the green (between E and F),
        i.e., exactly in that region where sensitiveness is most
        necessary. Moreover, if their sensitiveness is greater than that
        of ordinary plates on the side of the red, it is much less so on
        the side of the violet. If one uses them with a yellow glass, as
        has been proposed, the effects are disastrous. The impression
        between E and F, i.e., in the region of the green, from being
        insufficient is arrested altogether. Orthochromatic plates -- at
        least those made in France, which I have alone studied --
        possess beside the above defects that of being foggy. Even when
        one develops them in complete darkness they give gray and flat
        images. </p>

        <b><font size="+1">The Dematerialization of Matter Under the
            Action of Light</font></b></center>
      <p><b>1. The Dissociation of Matter Under the Influence of
          Different Radiations of the Solar Spectrum</b> </p>
      <p>I have studied at length, in <i>The Evolution of Matter</i>,
        the dissociation which all bodies undergo under the influence of
        luminous radiations, and have shown that a body struck by light
        emits effluves of the family of the cathode rays, of which the
        quantity varies considerably with the nature of the radiations.
        If I return to this question, it is because I have been led to
        study in this work the principal actions of light. My
        experiments on this subject were recently verified by one of the
        most illustrious scholars of the day, Sir William Ramsay (1). </p>
      <p>[(1) "The work", writes Sir William Ramsay, "was undertaken
        with the object of repeating some experiments of LeBon,
        described in several papers in the Comptes Rendus, and
        afterwards in greater detail in his treatise, <i>The Evolution
          of Matter</i>. It will be remembered that LeBon, by allowing
        ultraviolet to fall upon clean metallic surfaces raised to a
        high potential, caused them to give up their charges". -- <i>Philosophical






          Magazine</i>, October 1906, p. 401) </p>
      <p>He has published, with regard to the dissociation of matter
        under the influence of light, a memoir extremely remarkable, not
        only on account of the precision of the experiments, but also of
        the theoretical considerations which it contains. The results
        obtained by him were identical with my own, and he entirely
        admits the theory of the dissociation of matter. His conclusions
        are even bolder than mine. </p>
      <p>"If it turns out to be true", he says, "as Soddy claims to have
        shown" that a disintegrating element which parts with beta rays
        or electrons, leaves behind it matter not associated with a
        positive charge; and if it be also true that such
        ‘disintegration’ implies transmutation into some other form of
        ‘elementary matter’, then it may be that the phenomena of which
        a description is given on the following pages refer to cases of
        transmutation. When zinc, for example, illuminated by uv light
        parts with corpuscles, it may be that the residual matter -- the
        zinc minus electrons -- is no longer zinc, but some other form
        or forms of elementary matter". Ramsay considers the action of
        uv light, moreover, as a kind of detonator which produces the
        disintegration of the elements of matter. </p>
      <p>I was very pleased to see so eminent a scholar confirm the
        correctness of my experiments, and arrive at the conclusions
        which I have so long upheld. It will not be without interest to
        state briefly the origin of these last. </p>
      <p>The experiments by which I demonstrated that the action of
        light on bodies produced effluves similar to those of uranium --
        the only radioactive body then known -- are not new, since they
        were published for the first time about 10 years ago. They were
        the starting pint of my theory of the universal dissociation of
        matter, and I have recurred to them in several memoirs. </p>
      <p>After having shown that solar light exercised in different
        degrees a dissociating action on all bodies, I commenced the
        examination of uv radiations, the study of which had given rise
        to many works. My remarks demonstrated: -- </p>
      <p>(1) That the so-called negative discharge was likewise
        positive, contrary to what was then taught. </p>
      <p>(2) That the discharge of electrified bodies is very different
        according to the bodies employed, a point likewise verified by
        Ramsay, and contrary to what was then taught. </p>
      <p>(3) That it was not at all by the pulverization of the metal
        struck by light that the discharge was effected, as was formerly
        the opinion of Lenard, but by the dissociation of its atoms.
        This most important point, but little disputed at the present
        time, and likewise admitted by Ramsay, was very new and
        unforeseen at a date when no one dreamed of establishing a
        kinship of any kind between the effluves produced by the action
        of light and the cathode and uranium rays. </p>
      <p>All these experiments, which appear so simple when one reads
        them set forth in a book, bristle with enormous difficulties,
        and, above all, with causes of error, which explain the
        erroneous opinions formulated by observers. They studied,
        moreover, the action of light on bodies without having ever
        suspected that from this study would one day issue the theory of
        the dissociation of matter. </p>
      <p>Other persons will carry on these researches, for the subject
        is far from being exhausted. I shall render them service by
        pointing out the causes of error which delayed me for a long
        time, and finally led me to establish the spontaneous
        radioactivity of all the metals. Nothing would be more
        instructive for the history of the evolution of ideas than the
        recital of the uncertainties through which those engaged in
        research have passed, and of which their final works naturally
        contain no traces. </p>
      <p>In my first experiment&nbsp; had indeed verified that the
        effluves emitted by bodies subjected to the action of light
        passed, as has been likewise recognized by Ramsay, through thin
        metallic screens. But as they sometimes seemed to transpierce
        somewhat thick ones, I had to seek the reason of this anomaly.
        The cathode rays, to which I assimilated these effluves, can, in
        fact, only pass through extremely thin plates. </p>
      <p>I first observed that these effluves went round obstacles in
        the most curious way, as if they rolled on their surface. The
        remedy seemed very simple, since it was only a question of
        giving to the supposed screens the form of a closed cylinder
        surrounding the ball of the electroscope. But instead of
        simplifying the question I had created new problems, to
        interpret which took me several months. </p>
      <p>The electroscope, surrounded by its protecting cylinder, on
        exposure to the sun discharged itself to the extent of several
        degrees in a few minutes, and then it gave no further discharge,
        even when the metal was cleaned. If the cylinder was replaced by
        another of the same substance the discharge recommenced, and
        then after a certain lapse of time stopped again. For what
        reasons did a body having certain properties lose them a few
        minutes later? </p>
      <p>I will not enumerate here all the researches made to separate
        the factors which might be at work and to study the action of
        each. From one elimination after another, there remained only
        the influence of heat. This was indeed the active cause, for by
        replacing the sun by a body heated but not incandescent, and
        placed in the dark near the cylinder surrounding the
        electroscope, the discharge took place; but, as with the sun, it
        soon stopped. What part did heat play in this phenomenon? </p>
      <p>Evidently it was possible that an amount of heat only capable
        of raising by a few degrees the surface of a metal should render
        the air contained in its interior a conductor of electricity.
        Heat, moreover, could not be the only element which intervened,
        since the metal cylinders exposed to its action soon lost their
        influence on the electroscope. No amount of cleaning restored
        their properties. The majority of them, however, regained them
        spontaneously in the course of a few days. </p>
      <p>Again I had to proceed by successive elimination, and I at last
        succeeded in verifying that the metals lost under the influence
        of heat something which they cold afterwards regain by repose.
        This something was simply a small provision of radioactive
        particles formed spontaneously in all bodies. As the final
        result of these researches I reached the two following
        conclusions: -- (1) Light, especially the uv rays, which only
        exercise, as is known, an insignificant caloric action,
        dissociates matter and transforms it into products analogous to
        those emitted by radium or uranium; (2) outside the action of
        light, and independently of it, luminous or dark heat provokes
        in bodies the loss of an infinitesimal quantity of the
        radioactivity they contain, which may be spontaneously
        regenerated. All bodies are therefore slightly radioactive, and
        the dissociation of matter is indeed a universal phenomenon. </p>
      <p>Ramsay has very thoroughly observed in his skillful experiments
        this ‘fatigue’ of metals, which lose their properties more or
        less after a certain time. He attributes it to a modification of
        the equilibrium of the atoms on their surface, a theory which,
        however, does not sensibly differ from mine. </p>
      <p><b>2. Origin of the Phenomena Attributes to the Presence of
          Radium</b> </p>
      <p>Since I am on the subject of radioactivity, it will not be
        without interest to say a few words on a great discussion which
        has been eagerly followed by the English public, and in which
        the most eminent scholars -- Lord Kelvin, Sir Oliver Lodge, Sir
        William Crookes, etc. -- have taken part. From the scientific
        journals it has passed into political papers like the <i>Times</i>.
        Though the engagement was sharp, the conclusions have remained
        very uncertain. </p>
      <p>Its starting point was the extension of this theory, still very
        general but very erroneous, as may be seen by the above
        statements, that all radioactivity is due to the presence of
        radium or some body of that family. </p>
      <p>Radioactivity being now found everywhere, physicists who do not
        yet admit the theory of the universal dissociation of matter are
        indeed compelled to suppose that there is radium everywhere.
        After having been the most rare body in nature, it should now be
        the most abundant. </p>
      <p>Starting with this idea, a physicist maintained before the
        British Association that the internal heat of the globe might
        well be due to the action of the radium of which the earth
        should be full. </p>
      <p>Persons who have not made a deep study of this body may think
        that it is a well-defined substance like sodium or gold, and
        that consequently it is easy to ascertain its presence by
        certain reagents; now, it is nothing of the kind. Let us put
        aside certain rays in the spectrum of a rather disputable
        interpretation, and which, moreover, are only observed in very
        concentrated solutions of salts of radium; and let us examine on
        what is based the assertion that this body is very common. </p>
      <p>It is simply this fundamental characteristic -- the emission of
        particles which bear a certain quantity of electricity, and are
        therefore capable of discharging an electrometer. There exists
        no other means of practical investigation, and it was by taking
        this exclusively as a guide that radium was finally isolated
        from the various substances with which it was mixed up. </p>
      <p>This characteristic would, moreover, be an excellent touchstone
        if radium or the substance of the same family were alone present
        in it. But all bodies in nature possess it, as I have shown,
        either spontaneously or under the influence of very varied
        causes, such as light, heat, chemical reactions, etc.; and it
        follows that properties are attributed to radium which may
        belong to very different bodies. If we are bent on admitting
        that radioactivity is the cause of the internal temperature of
        the globe, there is no need to invoke to supposed presence of
        radium. All bodies at a high temperature, such as are apparently
        those which exist in the interior of our planet, liberate
        torrents of electric particles analogous to those produced by
        radium. I do not know whether they serve to maintain the earth’s
        heat, but it seems more reasonable to believe that they play a
        part in the production of earthquakes. </p>
      <p>That which concerns the actions of light on matter may be
        summed up in the statement that the light absorbed by a body
        transforms itself, according to that body and to the rays which
        act on it, into very different effects -- light, heat, chemical
        equilibria, dissociation of matter, etc. In the case of
        dissociation, the energy emitted by the dissociated body in the
        form of different particles may be far superior to the energy
        which provoked its dissociation. Light, then, acts like a spark
        on a mass of gunpowder. It may therefore be said in a general
        way that all the physical or chemical properties of a body which
        has absorbed light are more or less modified by the fact of this
        absorption alone. </p>

      </center>
      <p><b>1. The Different Forms of Phosphorescence</b> </p>
      <p>The name of phosphorescence is given to the property which
        several bodies possess of becoming luminous after having been
        exposed to various influences, that of solar radiations
        especially. </p>
      <p>Phosphorescence, one of the most difficult problems in physics,
        and one of these of which the interpretation is the most
        complicated, realizes the apparent paradox of generating cold
        light -- that is to say, light without any rise in temperature.
        In all our ordinary sources of lighting, light is only
        manifested after the bodies producing it have been first brought
        to a high temperature. </p>
      <p>For a long time, phosphorescence was thought a phenomenon as
        rare in the mineral as in the animal world. Recent researches on
        deep-sea animals prove that, for an immense number of beings,
        phosphorescence is a normal means of lighting which enables them
        to guide themselves in those dark abysses of the sea where the
        sun never penetrates. It may be asked at the present day whether
        the animals knowing no other light but phosphorescence are not
        more numerous than those whose light is the sun. The phenomena
        of phosphorescence which formerly struck us by their exceptional
        character, now do so by their frequency. </p>
      <p>We have often come across the action of phosphorescence in the
        course of our researches. The documents already published, which
        were confined almost entirely to the researches of Edmond
        Becquerel 50 years ago, not enabling me to explain the phenomena
        observed, I was led to take up this study anew. The new facts
        which I recognized are soon stated. </p>
      <p>The customary divisions of phosphorescence being very
        artificial, it would be useless to reproduce them. I shall
        confine myself to dividing the phenomena into four classes. The
        three first have long been known. The fourth is due to my
        researches. </p>
      <p>(1) Phosphorescence generated by light ~ (2) Phosphorescence
        independent of light and determined by different physical
        excitants such as heat, friction, electricity, and x-rays ~ (3)
        Phosphorescence by chemical reaction. In this class are placed
        the luminous phenomena exhibited by certain living beings ~ (4)
        Invisible phosphorescence. This comprises the production of
        light incapable of impressing the eye, but able to impress the
        photographic plate and to be rendered visible by different
        means. </p>
      <p>We will only study, in this chapter, the phosphorescence
        produced by light. </p>
      <p><b>2. Action of the Different Regions of the Spectrum on Bodies
          Capable of Phosphorescence</b> </p>
      <p>Many bodies, either natural, like the diamond, apatite,
        fluorite, and leucophane, or artificial, like the sulfides of
        the alkaline earths, have the property of shining in the dark
        after having been exposed for a moment to daylight. </p>
      <p>With the exception of the diamond, of which the luminosity is,
        at times, very vivid, the phosphorescence acquired by minerals
        is always much inferior to that of artificially manufactured
        substances. A very large number of bodies are capable, as
        Becquerel showed with his phosphoroscope, of acquiring the
        property of shining for a small fraction of a second after being
        exposed to light. </p>
      <p>In this last class of brief phosphorescence are placed the
        compounds called fluorescent. It was formerly wished to make of
        these a special class, on the pretext that they had the property
        of transforming invisible uv light into visible light. This
        property is really common to the various phosphorescent bodies.
        Nearly all, in fact, are capable of being illuminated by the uv
        end of the spectrum. </p>
      <p>The action of the various regions of the spectrum is best
        observed with the phosphorescent sulfides. These sulfides are
        only four in number: those of calcium, barium, strontium and
        zinc. Exposed to the light for a few seconds, they acquire a
        phosphorescence which lasts several hours after the insolation
        [exposure to the sun], but constantly decreases during this
        period. </p>
      <p>The great sensitiveness of these bodies to light comes very
        near to that of the gelatino-bromide photographic plates. </p>
      <p>The sulfides of calcium, of strontium, and of barium have very
        similar properties; they hardly differ from each other, except
        by the color of their phosphorescence and the rapidity with
        which they are impressed by light. The sulfide of calcium is the
        most rapidly impressed, that of strontium the least so. This
        last requires several seconds of insolation to reach its maximum
        of illumination, while the sulfide of calcium can be impressed
        in 1/30 second in the sun. </p>
      <p>The sulfide of zinc with green phosphorescence -- and not those
        with the yellow or orange -- possesses, for the study of the
        radiations from green to very far in the infrared, a special
        sensitiveness lacking in the other sulfides. Thanks to this, I
        was able to demonstrate the great transparency to light of
        bodies formerly deemed very opaque. A screen of zinc sulfide
        exposed to daylight when exposed to yellow, green, red, and
        especially to infrared radiations, is immediately extinguished.
        By precise measurements effected by diaphragms, of which I had
        measured the speed with a registering chronograph, I was able to
        note that, in less than 1/10 second, insolated zinc sulfide
        began to be extinguished in the infrared. I made use of this
        property to obtain instantaneous photographs in complete
        darkness, as will be seen in another chapter. </p>
      <p>The extreme sensitiveness of zinc sulfide renders its
        illumination very variable, according to the proportion of
        infrared rays contained in the various sources of light. While
        the other sulfides become illuminated by the simple light of a
        paraffin lamp, zinc sulfide not only does not do so, but becomes
        immediately extinguished if it has been previously exposed to
        daylight. </p>
      <p>The sulfides of calcium and strontium being little sensitive to
        the infrared rays, light up very well, on the contrary, with the
        light of a lamp or even of a candle. We thus obtain at once the
        means of distinguishing zinc sulfide if it be fraudulently
        substituted for zinc sulfide, although its phosphorescence
        possesses the same green tint. A screen of strontium sulfide
        becomes illuminated by the light of a candle; a screen of zinc
        sulfide previously exposed to sunlight, on the contrary, becomes
        extinguished. I must add that zinc sulfide with green
        phosphorescence, the only one serviceable for these experiments,
        is rarely met with in commerce. </p>
      <p>If zinc sulfide is a valuable reagent for the infrared rays,
        calcium sulfide is as valuable for the radiations of the other
        extremity of the spectrum -- that is to say, for the blue and
        violet rays. One-tenth second’s exposure to light suffices for
        its impression to commence. </p>
      <p>To study the action of the various rays of the spectrum on
        phosphorescence, we have only to place in the focus of a
        spectroscope adapted for projection and mounted on a camera
        obscura, a plate covered with a phosphorescent sulfide. And
        after exposure to light to open the carrier in the dark. </p>
      <p>I used a 3-prism spectroscope in front of which was a
        condensing lens, which is necessary in many experiments in order
        to increase the intensity of the luminous rays falling on the
        plate. In studying the action of light on phosphorescent bodies,
        these latter ought to be spread on glass or cardboard screens.
        The process of making phosphorescent screens, which I finally
        adopted after trying several, is the following:&nbsp; The
        sulfide is ground in an agate mortar and passed through a sieve
        of the very finest silk. It is then thoroughly mixed in the same
        mortar with a varnish known to color merchants a s bronzing
        varnish; the proportion of the powder added to the varnish may
        vary according to the quality of the later, but must not be less
        than 30 percent. When the mixture is perfectly homogeneous, it
        is poured, without being allowed to settle and in the same
        manner as collodion, onto a piece of cardboard laid flat. Care
        must be taken to gum on the edges of the card a small mount half
        a millimeter thick, and two or three mm wide. </p>
      <p>If the mixture is poured onto a strip of glass, we obtain a
        transparent screen having exactly the appearance of fine ground
        glass. If the liquid is poured on cardboard, the screen is
        naturally opaque, but as the coating can be made thicker, it is
        more luminous. When too much varnish has not been put into the
        mixture, the screen is dry and ready for use in 15 minutes. </p>
      <p>If we wish to preserve the image of the sulfide impressed by
        the various rays, all that is needed is to lay the screen for a
        few minutes on a photographic plate, which is afterwards
        developed in the ordinary way. </p>
      <p>When operating with screens as above described and placed in
        the focus of the spectroscope nothing is more simple than to
        observe the action of the various parts of the spectrum. We then
        remark that the only part of the solar spectrum able to impress
        phosphorescent bodies starts from the blue to end very far in
        the uv. The rest of the spectrum -- that is to say, all the rays
        from the green to far on in the infrared -- are not only without
        action on the production of phosphorescence, but destroy it when
        directed on a phosphorescent body made luminous by the uv rays.
      </p>
      <p>These facts had been summarily observed long ago, but the
        interpretation of them was very incomplete, for the excitation
        of light was attributed to a caloric excitement which obliged
        the sulfide to emit its phosphorescence in a short space of
        time. As far as concerns zinc sulfide especially, comparative
        experiments made on screens placed one beside the other have
        shown me that no period of excitement ever precedes the period
        of extinction. It is only in the case of calcium sulfide that a
        very slight excitement of phosphorescence is seen to precede its
        extinction. </p>
      <p>From the point of view of its action on phosphorescent bodies,
        the solar spectrum thus comprises two regions very different,
        since their properties are quite opposed to each other: (1) a
        region of illumination corresponding to about half of the
        visible spectrum, ranging from the blue to the uv; (2) a region
        of extinction corresponding to the other part of the spectrum
        and going far into the infrared. </p>
      <p>In the part intermediate between these two regions, varying
        slightly according to the sulfide used, but oscillating round
        the line F, there is a zone at once extinguishing and
        illuminating according to circumstances. With a screen of
        unexposed sulfide, it excites a certain degree of
        phosphorescence, which is always very slight. With a screen
        rendered very brilliant by previous insolation, it also restored
        the phosphorescence to a slight degree. </p>
      <p>These last experiments, easy to observe in a camera obscura
        furnished with a spectroscope, are more conveniently, though
        less exactly effected, with a simple yellow glass. If, in a
        photographic slide closed y a light yellow glass, a screen of
        unexposed calcium sulfide is placed, and beside it another
        screen previously insolated, and the frame is opened in the dark
        after the exposure of the two screens to sunlight through the
        yellow glass, it is observed that they are both very slightly
        luminous. On the non-insolated one, the rays which are both
        extinguishers and illuminators have acted as the latter, and
        have produced a slight phosphorescence. On the screen previously
        insolated of which the phosphorescence was at first very bright,
        they have acted as extinguishers and have reduced it
        considerably. There therefore exist rays possessing the property
        of both producing a certain degree of phosphorescence and
        extinguishing it when it exceeds that degree. </p>
      <p>The above results are of great importance. They will permit us,
        in another chapter, to resolve by very simple experiments the
        question of the existence of the antagonistic action of the two
        extremities of the spectrum. This point had been discussed for
        more than 50 years, and photographic experiments have not
        hitherto thrown much light upon it. </p>
      <p><b>3. Phosphorescence of the Diamond</b> </p>
      <p>Although by its phosphorescent actions the diamond resembles
        the bodies we have just studied, it yet possesses special and
        highly interesting properties, the study of which delayed me
        sometime. It is for this reason that I devote a section to it. </p>
      <p>The diamond differs from the other natural minerals capable of
        phosphorescence, because while in these last the aptitude for
        becoming luminous under the influence of light is in part
        destroyed by heat, in the diamond it is not so. </p>
      <p>Although the property possessed by the diamond of becoming
        luminous in the dark after having been exposed to the light was
        known throughout antiquity, its phosphorescence has not been the
        object of any special study. Mineralogists had not even taken
        the trouble to seek for the origin of phosphorescent diamonds,
        and to note that while certain mines furnish diamonds which are
        always phosphorescent, the contrary is the case with others. </p>
      <p>Cape diamonds, often as colorless as those of Brazil, and
        sometimes larger, are always very inferior to the Brazilian, not
        only by their hardness but also by their brightness. Placed by
        the side of the Brazilian, they appear dull. </p>
      <p>In order not to confuse the particular with the general, I
        studied about 200 diamonds of all sizes, some Cape and some
        Brazilian. The latter mostly came from the Bahia mine, and
        presented all known varieties of color. </p>
      <p>In order to study the visible phosphorescence, the diamonds
        were subjected to an illumination produced by a ribbon of
        magnesium 15 cm long, et on fire by a spirit lamp. This
        operation must always be effected by an assistant, while the
        observer remains in the dark so as not to be dazzled by the
        strong light of the burning magnesium, which prevents him
        afterwards from seeing the phosphorescence. </p>
      <p>The first trials made on a parcel of about 100 diamonds of all
        tints, half of them Brazilian and the other half Cape,
        immediately showed me one curious fact. Nearly all the Brazilian
        and all those of the Bahia mine were, during the operation,
        brightly phosphorescent, as much so as an isolated fragment of
        zinc sulfide. Not one of the Cape diamonds was phosphorescent. </p>
      <p>The non- phosphorescence of the Cape diamond is, however, not
        absolute, for after one has remained in the dark for at least 20
        minutes, in order to rest the eyes -- during which time the
        diamonds should be exposed to the sun by an assistant -- a very
        slight phosphorescence on nearly half of them is detected. This
        phosphorescence is on the border of the perceptible minimum of
        light, and is in no way comparable to the brilliant light of the
        Brazilian diamonds. </p>
      <p>The same experiments repeated many times with other diamonds of
        known origin have always afforded the same results (1). </p>
      <p>[(1) This means of distinguishing Brazilian from Cape diamonds
        is very exact, and has ore than once enabled me to enlighten
        purchasers of the real value of their diamonds, indications
        which have always been found correct by appraisers. I was able
        to discover immediately, out of a parcel of 60 Cape diamonds, a
        Brazilian one placed there in error. This diagnosis is available
        to everyone, and will enable many persons to observe that they
        sometimes pay nearly double their value for diamonds. A diamond
        sold for 10,000 francs on the strength of it being Brazilian is
        in reality only worth 6000 francs if it is from the Cape.) </p>
      <p>As a first conclusion, we see that it is not to the coloration
        of the diamond, but to its geological origin, that its
        phosphorescence is due. Whitish or yellowish diamonds from Bahia
        are phosphorescent, while those from the Cape are not, whatever
        be their color. </p>
      <p>As with the various phosphorescent bodies, pulverization
        notably reduced the phosphorescence of the diamond, but does not
        destroy it. </p>
      <p>All diamonds which phosphoresce by the action of light also do
        so when a pencil of x-rays is directed upon them. </p>
      <p>Subjected to the electric induction spark in the method
        described in another chapter, all diamonds become
        phosphorescent. They likewise become so when exposed to the
        influence of radium, even through a thin leaf of aluminum. </p>
      <p>We shall see in another chapter that diamonds likewise exhibit
        the phenomenon of invisible phosphorescence. </p>
      <p>The aptitude of diamonds for becoming phosphorescent by the
        action of light is not destroyed by heat, as in the case with
        many mineral substances. While, after being calcined for 15
        hours, it was destroyed in the case of many bodies, such as
        fluorspar, apatite, etc., yet I have been able to heat diamonds
        to 1000° C for 60 hours without altering their aptitude for
        phosphorescence. They have then been reduced to an impalpable
        powder in an agate mortar, and then calcined over again (1).
        This has not prevented them from again shining after insolation.
      </p>
      <p>[(1) This operation was necessary in order to discover if the
        phosphorescence were not due, in the case of the amethyst, so
        foreign bodies destructible by heat, It is not a very economical
        one, for the mercantile value of cut diamonds of small
        dimensions is about 1300 francs per gram. This cost would be
        much reduced by employing rough diamonds, but Brazilian rough
        diamonds are almost undiscoverable in Paris, merchants finding
        greater profit in importing them cut.) </p>
      <p>This persistence of the aptitude for phosphorescence,
        notwithstanding so prolonged a calcinations, shows that, if the
        phosphorescence of diamonds is due to the presence of foreign
        bodies, these bodies are not altered by heat, or at all events
        by a heat below that at which the diamond is destroyed. </p>
      <p>We are generally taught in the textbooks that the rough diamond
        is not phosphorescent, and only acquires that property after
        being polished. Landrin, in his <i>Dictionnaire de Mineralogie</i>,
        expresses himself as follows: -- "A crystal of fluorite is only
        phosphorescent when polished. The contrary is the case with the
        diamond, which only gives light after having been subjected to
        polishing, and does not manifest this faculty when in its
        natural crystalline state". </p>
      <p>I was almost convinced of the inexactitude of this assertion,
        since, according to my observations, the pulverized diamond does
        not lose its aptitude for phosphorescence. I was anxious,
        however, to verify by experiments this belief of mineralogist;
        for the scientific consequences of the property they attributed
        to the polished diamond would have been very great. As I
        expected, it was one of those classic errors repeated without
        verification to which repetition at length gives indisputable
        authority. Having succeeded in procuring some rough diamonds
        from Brazil, yellow, blue, and transparent -- some crystallized,
        others rounded -- I was enabled to note their phosphorescence by
        the action of light. </p>
      <p>The phosphorescence of diamonds seems to be connected, as in
        the case with other bodies, especially the sulfides before
        mentioned, with the presence of traces of foreign substances.
        The most transparent diamonds, when incinerated, leave a small
        quantity of ash hardly less than 2 percent, containing various
        bodies -- magnesia, lime, and especially iron. </p>
      <p><b>4. Relation Between the Intensity of the Phosphorescence and
          the Temperature of Insolated Substances</b> </p>
      <p>Is the degree of phosphorescence which an insolated body may
        reach, closely related to the temperature of this body during
        insolation? Experiment alone can decide this question. </p>
      <p>At a temperature markedly below 0° C, and varying according to
        the substance, bodies exposed to the light do not acquire
        visible phosphorescence. Above this temperature the intensity of
        phosphorescence obtained by a body exposed to the light
        increases when heated up to 100° C. Above 100° C, the
        phosphorescence it may acquire diminishes, and towards 500° C
        falls to nothing. The influence of this high temperature may be
        explained by admitting that the precipitation of the light by
        heat is then as rapid as the absorption. The expulsion taking
        place at the same time as the absorption, the phosphorescence
        does not appear. </p>
      <p>The above facts can be verified by means of screens of calcium
        sulfide placed on cards divided into halves. The two halves,
        placed side by side in the dark, on recipients brought to
        different temperatures, are examined as soon as they have been
        lighted up by a magnesium ribbon. Towards about -190° C, which
        temperature is obtained by plunging the screens of sulfide into
        liquid air, no phosphorescence under the action of light is
        observed, as was first recognized by Dewar; but on withdrawing
        the screen, and leaving it for a moment in the dark at the
        ambient temperature, it becomes luminous. The passage from -190°
        C to the ambient temperature represents to the sulfide a
        considerable increase of heat, which causes it to rapidly expel
        the invisible phosphorescence acquired at -190° C. </p>
      <p>But it is between 0° C and 100° C that the experiment is most
        easily effected. One half of the screen having been placed on a
        block of ice, the other on a sand bath heated to different
        temperatures, we observe after exposure to magnesium light that
        the sulfide exposed when heated to 100° C is much more brilliant
        than that exposed to 0° C. In the case of calcium sulfide the
        difference is considerable, but much less so in the case of zinc
        sulfide. </p>
      <p>If one of the two screens is placed on a plate heated to 200°
        C, and the other kept at the temperature of the ambient air, <i>i.e</i>.,





        about 15° C, we recognize, after illumination by magnesium, that
        the screen heated to 200° C is much less brilliant than the
        other. Repeating the same experiment with a screen heated to
        500° C, we only obtain on it an extremely light phosphorescence.
        I have given above the probable reason for these differences. </p>
      <p><b>5. Loss of phosphorescence by the Action of Time</b> </p>
      <p>What has been said of the action of various rays of the
        spectrum and of the temperature during exposure has already
        proved that the intensity of phosphorescence depends on several
        factors. </p>
      <p>There remains to us one more to study, viz. Time. All authors
        have regarded it as having a preponderating influence. </p>
      <p>Time has, on the loss of phosphorescence, an influence evident
        but inferior to that of temperature. As the visible
        phosphorescence which follows insolation hardly exceeds for the
        most sensitive bodies the duration of a few hours, time has
        hitherto been considered as the principle element destructive of
        phosphorescence. This element has in reality no fundamental
        influence, since, by means of a suitable temperature, we can
        entirely eliminate its action. </p>
      <p>Curves of the loss of phosphorescence as a function of the time
        have several times been published, and their equations
        calculated. These curves would only mean something if they
        expressed the loss at a given temperature, for this loss varies
        with the temperature. The number of curves would then have to be
        very considerable, since a special one would be required for
        each temperature. </p>
      <p>Curves thus constructed would have, moreover, no characteristic
        in common. At a very low temperature varying with each body, the
        curve of loss as a function of the time would be represented by
        a line nearly horizontal, which would signify that at that
        temperature the phosphorescence diminished very slowly. At a
        high temperature the curve would be almost vertical, signifying
        that the loss of phosphorescence is, on the contrary, very
        rapid. At an intermediate temperature the curve would be
        represented by a line at first and during the first few seconds
        after insolation almost vertical, and then after a fairly short
        time almost horizontal. </p>
      <p>If the influence of temperature had been more carefully
        studied, it would have been seen long ago that these curves of
        the loss of phosphorescence as a function of the time, since
        they set aside a much more important factor than time, could
        possess no correctness. </p>
      <p>Not only is time a secondary factor in the phenomenon, but a
        moment arrives when it has no effect on the loss of
        phosphorescence. We shall see, in fact, that after a certain
        emission of light at a given temperature, the body retains
        indefinitely a residual phosphorescence so long as its
        temperature is not again raised. </p>
      <p>This law is very general. The loss of phosphorescence after
        insolation, which appears to be spontaneous in certain bodies,
        such as the sulfides, is the result of their not being able to
        retain at the ordinary temperature an excess of phosphorescence,
        against which an antagonistic force, to which I shall refer
        later on, contends. By cooling them sufficiently, we suppress
        all emission. They are then analogous to bodies such as fluorite
        or apatite, which are only phosphorescent above 50° C, and on
        which time has absolutely no effect. </p>
      <p>The action of temperature is therefore much more important than
        that of time. It is this, and not time, which regulates the
        emission of phosphorescence. </p>
      <p>There can, however, be deduced some useful information from the
        study of the loss of light under the influence of time if the
        temperature be kept constant for the whole duration of the
        phosphorescent emission. </p>
      <p>Let us take a screen of insolated calcium sulfide, keep it at
        15° C, and examine the curve of the loss of its light. It will
        fully justify what has been said regarding the part played by
        temperature. </p>
      <p>If this last remains constant, the fall of the curve,
        representing the loss of phosphorescence as a function of the
        time, is for the first minute after the insolation almost
        vertical. It then bends slowly, becomes less and less oblique,
        and finally quite horizontal. At this moment the body no longer
        radiates, time no longer influences it, and it keeps intact an
        invisible provision of luminous energy which it will part with
        only by various means, or, more particularly, by a rise in its
        temperature. We will return at length to this last point in
        another chapter. </p>
      <p>The general appearance of the above curve shows, indeed, that
        things happen as if the reaction exciting the phosphorescence
        placed itself in equilibrium with an opposing force acting in a
        converse direction. Immediately after its insolation the screen
        contains an excess of phosphorescence. Under the influence of
        the opposing force, this excess is dissipated, rapidly at first,
        then slowly when that moment approaches when the equilibrium is
        established between the phosphorescence and the opposing force.
        When this equilibrium is attained, the reactions which produce
        the phosphorescence stop entirely. The opposing force being
        unable to act further on the reaction which generated the
        phosphorescence, the body will retain its residue of
        phosphorescence until a rise in temperature again destroys the
        equilibrium. </p>
      <p>I do not know of what this opposing force consists. I can only
        say that things take place exactly as if it existed. This
        interpretation has also led me to the discovery of the discovery
        of the phenomena of invisible phosphorescence studied in a
        future chapter. </p>

        <b><font size="+1">Phosphorescence Produced by Heat</font></b></center>
      <p><b>1. Method of Observation</b> </p>
      <p>Many minerals in nature possess the property of acquiring a
        bright phosphorescence when brought to a low temperature without
        first having first been exposed to light. If the heating is
        sufficiently prolonged, they lose all their provision of
        phosphorescence, and no longer shine when heated after being
        allowed to cool. They regain, but in a slight degree, the
        property of shining by a rise in temperature, when we expose
        them to the light after having exhausted their phosphorescence
        by heating. </p>
      <p>These facts, which have been known for a long time, represent
        about all that is to be found in textbooks on physics regarding
        phosphorescence produced by heat. </p>
      <p>It is astonishing that so surprising a phenomenon as the
        phosphorescence caused by slight heat should not long ago have
        engaged the attention of physicists. With the theories current
        it is not apparent in what form a body cold have preserved since
        its geological formation a provision of luminous energy which we
        can force it to expend by fringing it to a temperature which may
        often be less than 100° C. </p>
      <p>The experiments now to be mentioned prove that the explanation
        of the phenomenon is much simpler than that last given. It is
        not in the form of luminous energy that bodies preserve for ages
        their aptitude for phosphorescence on a slight rise in
        temperature. They have simply preserved compounds incapable of
        combining with each other at an ordinary temperature, but able
        to do so when it is raised, which is the case with many chemical
        reactions. Phosphorescence simply arises from these
        combinations. Bodies in presence of each other which will not
        combine under a certain temperature, can evidently retain for an
        indefinite period the aptitude for phosphorescence just as
        chlorine and hydrogen remain inactive for an indefinite period
        in darkness, and combine only when we introduce some exciting
        agent such as light. </p>
      <p>If I had not deemed it useless to modify accepted
        classifications, it is really in the paragraph devoted to
        phosphorescence by chemical reaction that I should have inserted
        that which concerns phosphorescence produced by heat. </p>
      <p>The methodical study of the action of heat on phosphorescence
        demands a little apparatus easy to construct. It will serve us
        not only for study of the action of heat, but likewise for that
        of the infrared and of invisible phosphorescence, which we shall
        examine in other chapters. </p>
      <p>The method of observation plays an important part in the
        research into the phenomena of phosphorescence by heat. The
        processes of observation employed by mineralogists, which
        consist in placing the bodies to be examined on metal plates or
        crucibles at a red heat, are quite primitive, and it is because
        their processes are rude that so many phenomena have escaped
        them. </p>
      <p>The moment the source of heat becomes visible, whether it be
        produced by a simple spirit lamp, or a gas burner with a blue
        flame, the eye is dazzled, and all feeble phosphorescence
        escapes observation. </p>
      <p>For the purpose of studying the phosphorescence produced near
        the regions of the red rays, I simply make use of a large metal
        box, without a cover, inverted over a small spirit lamp. Its
        sides should be serrated at the bottom to allow the passage of
        air, and, in the part over the lamp, an orifice made in which to
        place a small copper cup one-tenth of a millimeter thick, which
        receives the body to be heated. By reason of the thinness of its
        walls this cup can be heated and cooled almost instantaneously.
        It can be made red-hot with the greatest ease, whenever
        necessary. </p>
      <p>We procure from a dealer in photographic apparatus one of those
        triple burner lamps with a metal chimney, which are used for
        lighting magic lanterns. On the upper extremity of the chimney,
        which is pierced with lateral holes for the passage of air, we
        place horizontally, in order to stop the light entirely and to
        have a plane surface to receive the bodies required to be
        heated, the lid of a biscuit box. The glass or mica plate
        through which the light of the lamp issues, and which slides in
        grooves, is replaced by a metal plate which thus masks all the
        visible rays. As a little light still issues from the lower part
        of the apparatus, the latter is surrounded by cardboard, which
        entirely envelopes it. </p>
      <p><b>Figure 22 / 23</b> </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="1fig2223.jpg" height="586" width="486"></p>
      </center>
      <p>Thus constituted, the apparatus is all that is needed for
        researches where heat alone comes into play. But in many
        experiments on invisible phosphorescence, we need an abundant
        source of infrared variations of determinate wavelength. In
        order to obtain these, it suffices to replace the metal plate in
        front of the lamp by a strip of ebonite about 0.5 mm thick,
        fixed between two strips of glass to prevent its shape being
        altered by the heat. The ebonite may be replaced with advantage
        by black glass, but this must be of good quality, so that the
        disc of the sun cannot be seen through it, and yet that it may
        be transparent to the infrared. This being difficult to procure,
        I do not dwell on its use. </p>
      <p>Under these conditions, the lamp gives the following
        temperatures: -- </p>
      <p>(1) With all three burners alight, about 225° C; (2) With two
        burners, about 130° C; (3) With one burner, about 65° C; (4)
        Temperature of the vertical side of the metallic chimney of the
        lamp, about 105° C.; (5) Temperature at 1 cm from the vertical
        side of the chimney, about 50° C. </p>
      <p>In front of the strip of ebonite or black glass, the
        temperature at 2 mm of their surface is only 30° C., but through
        these bodies there passes a great quantity of invisible infrared
        radiations, of which a great part is comprised in the region of
        the spectrum from 0.3 microns to about 3 microns. It is these
        which act on phosphorescent substances, and possess the property
        of passing through opaque bodies, as we shall see in another
        chapter. </p>
      <p>All the metal sides of the lamp also, of course, emit infrared
        rays, as do all heated bodies, but these radiations, having a
        wavelength of 5 microns to 10 microns, do not act on
        phosphorescent bodies. </p>
      <p>In this manner is constituted the source of heat and of dark
        radiations which I have designated by the name of ‘dark lamp’. </p>
      <p>The instrument should be placed in an absolutely dark room. It
        is preferable to make the experiments in the evening, for then
        the eye is much more sensitive to dim light. If the operations
        are effected in daylight, one should remain 15 minutes in the
        dark and let the illumination, whether by magnesium or by the
        sun, be carried out by an assistant, while the observer remains
        in the dark. This last precaution is quite indispensable. Many
        phenomena escaped me at the commencement of my experiments for
        want of this precaution. </p>
      <p><b>2. The Properties of Bodies Phosphorescent by Heat</b> </p>
      <p>The list of bodies phosphorescent by heat is very long, though
        in treatises on mineralogy but a small number a re given:
        fluorite, fluorspar, topaz, several varieties of calcium
        phosphate, leucophane, diamond, are noticeable among them. A
        large number of others must now be added to these different
        bodies. Among those I have examined I will mention especially
        the Siberian and Bogotan emeralds, the Auvergne amethyst (but
        not that of Madagascar), the chlorospinel, the opal, cryolite,
        scheelite, Wagnerite, phenacite, petalite, castor, pollux,
        colemanite, talc, baryta, etc. </p>
      <p>Most of these compounds are of aqueous origin. Bodies very
        phosphorescent by light -- that is, the sulfides of the alkaline
        earths -- only acquire, on the contrary, the property of
        becoming phosphorescent after having been subjected, during
        their manufacture, to a high temperature. </p>
      <p>Many of the bodies phosphorescent by heat, and especially the
        Australian opal, leucophane, and the apatite of Estrmadura,
        together with nearly all the different varieties of fluorite,
        likewise become phosphorescent by exposure to light; but their
        phosphorescence, being in that case very slight, is only
        perceived by the observer after a stay of 15 minutes in the
        dark. </p>
      <p>As the above bodies possess identical properties, and only
        differ from one another by the intensity of their
        phosphorescence, its duration, and the temperatures at which it
        manifests, I shall here confine myself to the examination of
        some of those which offer the brightest phosphorescence -- such
        as the apatite of Estremadura and the green fluorite especially.
      </p>
      <p>The apatite of Estremadura, a body easily procured in large
        quantities, is the one of which the phosphorescence commences at
        the lowest temperature. Reduced to powder, and put in a tube
        placed in a sand bath or in water slowly heated in the dark, it
        begins to shine with a feeble light at 51° C. Heated to 200° C
        it acquires a bright phosphorescence, which lasts for about an
        hour, on condition, be it understood, that that temperature is
        not exceeded. If brought to a red heat its brilliancy will be
        greater still, but will pass off in less than a minute. </p>
      <p>The different varieties of fluorite noticed by me -- and they
        are very numerous -- behave much like apatite, but are always
        less luminous. </p>
      <p>The temperature at which the fluorites become phosphorescent
        varies greatly with the different samples. I have examined some
        30 of different origins, and have noted that the majority sine
        at temperatures below 200° C. The varieties which become
        illuminated at the lowest temperature are those from Morgen
        (Saone and Loire), from the Pyrenees, and from Schwarzenbergen
        in Saxony. They commence to shine at about 62° C. </p>
      <p>It has been said that the transparent fluorites do not exhibit
        phosphorescence by heat, This erroneous assertion can only be
        due to an imperfect method of observation. All the fluorites
        that I have examined, including some which were colorless and
        transparent as glass, and which are used in the manufacture of
        prisms and lenses, are very phosphorescent by heat. I have,
        moreover, found but one sample of fluorite which was not
        phosphorescent by heat, i.e., the yellowish cubic variety in
        little crystals which comes from Herblay. </p>
      <p>All fluorites are slightly phosphorescent by light, save the
        yellow variety above mentioned and a green crystallized fluorite
        coming from Durham. </p>
      <p>When, after the expulsion by heat of all their phosphorescence,
        the bodies examined above are exposed to the sun and heated
        anew, they again shine, but much less brightly than the first
        time. </p>
      <p>The property appertaining to several bodies like fluorite, of
        becoming phosphorescent at one and the same time by heat and by
        light, has been the origin of an error which for a century runs
        through all treatises on mineralogy, and has been religiously
        repeated by various authors, including Becquerel, without their
        ever having taken the trouble to verify the grounds of it.
        According to them, certain varieties of the green fluorite
        called chlorophane shine indefinitely in the dark at a
        temperature of 30° C -- that is to say, they are luminous in
        darkness nearly all the summer in our climate and the whole year
        round in hot countries. This is how Boudant expresses himself
        with regard to this matter: -- </p>
      <p>"There are varieties designated under the name of Chlorophane,
        of which some are phosphorescent at the average temperature of
        our climate, so that they shine constantly in the dark, while
        others simply require the temperature of the hand" (<i>Mineralogie</i>,
        2nd edition, vol. 1., p. 203). </p>
      <p>The most recent and important German treatise on mineralogy,
        that of Naumann and Zirkel, expresses the same idea: "Many
        topazes, diamonds, and fluorites become phosphorescent at the
        temperature of the hand. The green fluorite (chlorophane) often
        remains brilliant for weeks after being insolated". </p>
      <p>Although this fact enunciated by mineralogists seemed
        theoretically very improbable, I desired, by reason of its
        consequences, to verify it. I therefore examined innumerable
        samples of the variety of fluorites called chlorophane from the
        most important firms of mineralogists in Europe. Not one shone
        at 30° C., nor at the temperature of the hand. </p>
      <p>Evidently this was bound to be so. Suppose, in fact, they could
        have shone at from 30° to 37° C. Having been many times exposed
        to this temperature since their geological formation, they must
        have lost long ago their provision of phosphorescence, unless we
        class them in the category of radioactive bodies spontaneously
        and perpetually phosphorescent. </p>
      <p>After having discovered that the fact set forth by physicists
        like Becquerel and mineralogists like Boudant was incorrect, the
        cause of the error had to be established. Its explanation was
        very simple. </p>
      <p>The fluorites in question acquire, by insolation, a very feeble
        phosphorescence, which the eye, unless previously rested, does
        not perceive in the dark. If heated subsequently by holding them
        in the hand, it happens, as is also the case with all
        phosphorescent bodies, that their luminosity becomes more vivid.
        It is then easily seen, and the observer concludes that it is
        the heat of the hand which has produced this phosphorescence. To
        be convinced that it is nothing of the kind, we need only leave
        the sample in the dark for 48 hours. Then, placing it in the
        hollow of the hand, it is noticed that it no longer shines at
        all. If it be exposed to the light and then placed in the hand,
        it will shine at once. Consequently light is plainly the origin
        of the phenomenon. </p>
      <p>The cause of the error, so faithfully reproduced in all
        treatises of mineralogy, was therefore that operators had left
        their specimens of fluorite exposed to the light before putting
        it in their hand. Far from shining all the summer, fluorite
        actually does not keep this property after insolation longer
        than ordinary phosphorescent bodies -- that is to say, for a few
        hours. </p>
      <p>What is the origin of the phosphorescence manifested by certain
        bodies under the influence of heat? Phosphorescent sulfides can
        retain indefinitely a part of the energy stored up by exposure
        to light. Might it not then be supposed that the phosphorescence
        emitted under the influence of heat is due to the fact that the
        bodies manifesting it have often been manipulated in the light
        before reaching the hands of the observer? Their phosphorescence
        would consequently be of recent origin, and analogous to that
        preserved for years by the sulfides after insolation, which can
        be made to appear by heating. </p>
      <p>In order to solve this question, it was necessary to examine
        bodies which had not been brought to light since their
        geological formation. </p>
      <p>For this purpose, it sufficed to break up, in absolute
        darkness, large blocks of apatite and fluorite, to extract
        fragments from the center of these blocks, and to subject them
        to the influence of heat. These fragments shone as vividly as
        those taken from the surface of the blocks. It was therefore not
        to a residuum derived from the recent origin of light that their
        phosphorescence was due. </p>
      <p>When studying the causes of phosphorescence, we shall see that
        the light manifested by bodies under the influence of
        temperature is the result of chemical reaction provoked by heat.
        In bodies phosphorescent by light, in ordinary temperature,
        these combinations are easily reformed after being torn apart,
        and that is why all their phosphorescence is restored to them by
        exposing them anew to the light when they have become dark. For
        bodies which only become phosphorescent at a more or less
        elevated temperature, and only regain very feebly the aptitude
        for anew phosphorescence by heat after insolation, it is
        probable that the combinations destroyed by the temperature are
        only very incompletely reformed by light. We shall see, however,
        that they may be completely regenerated under the influence of
        electricity, and that there can be restored to bodies which have
        lost it, the property of shining anew under the influence of
        heat as vividly as the first time they were heated. </p>
      <p>The aptitude of bodies to again become phosphorescent in the
        light after having been heated is, moreover, only lost with
        great difficulty. All those on which I have experimented --
        fluotire, leucophane, apatite, etc. -- must be calcined at a red
        heat for 15 hours before losing it entirely. Ten hours of
        calcinations were quite insufficient. </p>
      <p>How does a protracted rise in temperature act? Why does it take
        from a body its aptitude for giving phosphorescence? </p>
      <p>The first idea which strikes one is that the calcinations
        destroys certain foreign bodies necessary to phosphorescence. </p>
      <p>This hypothesis seems at first sight justified by the change in
        appearance undergone by a small number of bodies subjected to
        this calcination. The violet amethyst, when calcined, loses its
        color entirely, and becomes as transparent as glass. It has
        therefore evidently lost something which produced the
        phosphorescence, since this can no longer be restored to it
        afterwards by the action of light or heat. </p>
      <p>But that which is true as regards amethysts and, perhaps, also
        other bodies, ceases entirely to be so for the great majority of
        phosphorescent substances. By calcining them for 15 hours, I
        have caused them to lose entirely their property of becoming
        again phosphorescent by heat after insolation. But by this
        operation I eliminated no foreign element. I simply destroyed
        the aptitude of the bodies present for chemical combination.
        Proof of this is furnished by the fact that by suitable
        treatment the aptitude to become phosphorescent by heat as they
        were before calcinations can be restored to calcined bodies. </p>
      <p>To restore to a calcined body its aptitude for phosphorescence,
        it suffices to pass electric sparks through it for a certain
        length of time. This property of the electric spark was
        summarily observed as early as the first years of the last
        century. As, however, the induction coil was not then known, I
        thought it might be useful to take up again the study of the
        phenomenon. </p>
      <p>The bodies subjected to the influence of the induction spark
        were placed in a glass tube closed at its two extremities by
        corks, through which passed copper rods connected to a strong
        coil. By approaching and withdrawing these two rods sparks of
        from 1 to 15 cm could be obtained at will. </p>
      <p>The length of the spark has a manifest action. If, for example,
        calcium carbonate is electrified by a spark of 2 cm, it shines
        very feebly at 200° C. It shines, on the contrary, very vividly
        if the spark is 15 cm long. </p>
      <p>The duration of the electrification has also a notable
        influence. If powdered glass is electrified for 5 seconds only,
        it shines but feebly at 200° C. It shines, on the contrary,
        vividly at that temperatures if the action of the spark is
        prolonged for 5 minutes. </p>
      <p>In a general way, electricity simply vivifies the
        phosphorescence of bodies which, without its influence, would
        have been very weak, but it has never, to my knowledge,
        communicated it to bodies without any traces of it. In addition,
        it lowers the degree at which they begin to shine by the action
        of heat. Cape diamonds, hardly phosphorescent at 200° C., shine
        brilliantly at this temperature after the passage of electricity
        through them. Bologna spar, which only shines at 500° C. without
        electrification, is brilliant at 200° C, so soon as it has been
        electrified. </p>
      <p>There exists indeed a very small number of bodies which present
        no trace of phosphorescence at 500° C., and give a very slight
        one at that temperature after electrification. This is, for
        example, the case with barium bromide. But then it may be
        supposed that before electrification they manifested a
        phosphorescence too slight to be visible. I found this
        conclusion on this general fact -- that electrification only
        renders more vivid a slight phosphorescence. Even with bodies
        which possess a bright phosphorescence when they are impure,
        such as the sulfides of calcium, barium, strontium, and zinc,
        the electric spark confers on them no trace of aptitude for
        phosphorescence when they are pure. </p>
      <p>The only bodies to which no phosphorescence can be restored by
        electricity are those to which calcinations really causes a
        loss. Such is the case with the amethyst, which loses its
        coloring matter when calcined. To all other bodies
        phosphorescent by heat, electrification restores the
        phosphorescence lost by calcinations. I have noted it especially
        in fluorite, leucophane, and apatite, which after having been
        calcined for 15 hours, lost the property of regaining
        phosphorescence by heat after insolation. </p>
      <p>In this last case the body heated to 500° C will first emit all
        it can lose at all lower temperatures, and consequently will no
        longer be able to shine at less than 500° C. To give it back its
        phosphorescence, it will have to be heated again to 500° C or
        more. </p>
      <p>This general law of the emission of phosphorescence as a
        function of the temperature, already pointed out in the last
        chapter, enables us to unite in one class certain bodies
        phosphorescent by light and heat, till now separated. We can
        very easily, in fact, transform bodies phosphorescent by light
        into bodies phosphorescent by heat. The sulfides of calcium,
        zinc, and strontium, kept in the dark for days or years after
        their insolation, are identical with bodies phosphorescent by
        heat, such as the amethyst, fluorite, leucophane, and apatite.
        It will suffice also to heat them up to about 70 C to enable us
        to see them shine. </p>
      <p>The analogy may be, however, carried much further. The
        substances we call phosphorescent by heat only shine at
        determinate temperatures varying from to 300° C, according to
        the bodies observed. The luminous sulfides, which shine when
        insolated at the normal temperature differ from the preceding
        bodies solely because the temperature at which they cease
        shining is much lower. Dewar, as has been said, has shown that,
        in liquid air, insolated bodies acquire no phosphorescence, but
        that they manifest it so soon as they are allowed to return to
        the ambient temperature. To bring bodies refrigerated to about
        -190° C back to the temperature of the ambient air, simply
        signifies that we heat them to more than 200° C (1). Sulfides
        which are dark at -190° C and shine at 0° C are analogous to
        bodies which become phosphorescent by heat at a temperature of
        +200° C. Both kinds are only phosphorescent when they have been
        sufficiently heated. A phosphorescent sulfide kept for an
        indefinite time at -190° C would always remain dark, as would
        apatite kept indefinitely at a temperature lower than +50° C.
        The two bodies only differ, I repeat, by the temperature at
        which the combinations accompanying their phosphorescence take
        place. </p>
      <p>[(1) These are, however, changes much too great. The divers
        phosphorescent sulfides cease to shine long before -190° C, and
        return to phosphorescence long before 0 C is reached. The
        temperature varies, moreover, with the various sulfides.] </p>
      <p>When bodies phosphorescent by heat have been brought to the
        temperature at which their phosphorescence becomes extinguished,
        they cannot, as has been said, recover by exposure to the light
        more than a very small part of it. This is probably due to the
        fact that the chemical reaction which produces the
        phosphorescence can only be partially regenerated in certain
        bodies by light, while in others it is totally so, as especially
        with the phosphorescent sulfides and diamonds. There exists no
        real barrier between bodies phosphorescent by light and those
        phosphorescent by heat. </p>
      <p>From the above consideration may be deduced the following laws,
        applicable to all bodies phosphorescent by light or by heat: --
      </p>
      <p>(1) There are no bodies phosphorescent without heat. A body
        capable of being rendered phosphorescent by light will only
        manifest its phosphorescence at a certain temperature. </p>
      <p>(2) For each phosphorescent body there is a minimum temperature
        below which exposure to the light cannot produce visible
        phosphorescence. </p>
      <p>(3) To each temperature corresponds a certain emission of
        phosphorescence which cannot be exceeded. </p>
      <p>(4) Bodies which heat renders phosphorescent also become so by
        light, but only slightly. They differ from those vividly
        phosphorescent by light only in that in these last the luminous
        rays entirely regenerate the whole of the destroyed
        phosphorescence instead of regenerating only a part of it. </p>

        <b><font size="+1">Phosphorescence Proceeding From Causes Other
            Than Light and Heat</font></b></center>
      <p><b>(1) Phosphorescence through Impact and by Friction</b> </p>
      <p>A large number of bodies become phosphorescent by friction or
        by impact. In the case of some -- apatite, leucophane, diamonds,
        sugar and uranium -- the impacts or movements may be slight; for
        others -- such as fluorite and silex -- the friction or impact
        must be somewhat energetic. </p>
      <p>Whether violent or slight, they only generate a very weak rise
        in temperature, quite insufficient to bring them to
        incandescence. It cannot therefore be heat which produces the
        phosphorescence observed in these substances mentioned. </p>
      <p>Neither does the shock not the friction determine the
        preliminary operations necessary to produce a reaction
        propagated from point to point, as in the decomposition of
        nitrogen iodide for instance. Phosphorescence by shock or
        friction does not, in fact, survive the disappearance of its
        cause, as in the case with that due to light. </p>
      <p>The oxygen of the air plays no part in phosphorescence by
        shock, which is favored, on the contrary, by the total absence
        of oxygen -- that is to say, by a vacuum. An exhausted tube
        containing a little mercury becomes luminous as soon as the
        metal is displaced by a slight movement. </p>
      <p>Several bodies which friction renders phosphorescent also
        become so by the action of light and of heat. There exist,
        however, a small number such as metallic uranium, which are
        rendered phosphorescent exclusively by friction. </p>
      <p>If, by a very prolonged calcinations, we destroy the property
        possessed by may bodies -- leucite, apatite, and leucophane --
        of phosphorescence under the influence of heat, these substances
        regain the facility of becoming luminous by friction. We shall
        notice, on the other hand, that bodies hardly at all
        phosphorescent by heat, like Cape diamonds, become vividly so by
        friction. </p>
      <p>The result of these experiments seems to be that the reactions
        which give rise to bodies an aptitude for luminous and caloric
        phosphorescence differ from those which cause them to shine
        after friction or a shock. It is probable, however, that it is
        an action of different causes producing the same effect. </p>
      <p><b>2. Phosphorescence by X-rays, Cathode Rays and
          High-Frequency Effluves ~</b> </p>
      <p>The phenomena of phosphorescence from the above causes are very
        well known, and shall have very little to add to them. </p>
      <p>We know that a large number of bodies, and among them compounds
        not phosphorescent by other processes, such as rubies, become
        extremely luminous when exposed to the bombardment of the
        rarified gases in a Crookes tube. The phosphorescence of those
        which become brilliant in a strong light, such as diamonds and
        certain sulfides, is greatly increased. It is sufficient to
        place them in a Geissler tube subjected to induction sparks.
        With some calcium sulfide in such a tube, I was able to obtain a
        phosphorescence of which the brilliancy, surface for surface,
        reached 7/10 of a candlepower. </p>
      <p>The x-rays from a Crookes tube provoke only a very weak
        phosphorescence, and only in a small number of bodies, contrary
        to what is generally thought. Even with those phosphorescent in
        ordinary or in uv light, the illumination is slight/ The x-rays
        make calcium sulfide luminous to an extremely slight extent,
        much less than would a simple candle. They also illumine
        moderately -- that is to say, much less than ordinary daylight
        -- zinc sulfide, and herein differ entirely from the uv
        radiations to which it was for a long time sought to assimilate
        them. </p>
      <p>On the fluorescent substances -- that is to say, those of which
        the phosphorescence does not survive the cause producing it --
        the x-rays act, on the contrary, very vividly, therein behaving
        like uv rays, but more energetically. It was even, as is known,
        this property which caused their discovery, and rendered them
        utilizable. Platinocyanide of barium, of which radiographic
        screens are formed, is not the only salt which becomes strongly
        luminous under their action. Apatite, leucophane, fluorite, and,
        above all, Brazilian diamonds are also illuminated, though more
        feebly. </p>
      <p>Many bodies, diamonds, zinc sulfide, etc., which are luminous
        under the influence of the x-rays, also become so under the
        action of the salts of radium. Cape diamonds, not phosphorescent
        by light, become so in presence of radium bromide, even when
        this salt is enclosed in a thin metal tube. </p>
      <p>Sir W. Crookes has remarked that diamonds placed for several
        months in contact with radium, acquire such a radioactivity that
        it does not disappear when they are heated to a dark red. </p>
      <p>Taken altogether, the preceding phenomena show us that certain
        bodies become phosphorescent from very different causes --
        light, shock, cathode rays, x-rays, etc.; these causes perhaps
        act, as has been said, by producing reactions, which, if not
        identical, are at least of the same order. </p>
      <p><b>(3). Phosphorescence by Chemical Reaction</b> </p>
      <p>For a long time, the only chemical reaction known to produce
        phosphorescence was the slow oxidation of phosphorus. It is
        known, by recent investigations, that phosphorescence
        accompanies a considerable number of reactions. </p>
      <p>Most of these, however, are badly defined and result from
        somewhat complex mixtures. Thus, for instance, those produced by
        mixing certain organic bodies, such as esculine or various
        essences with an alcoholic solution of potash, or, again, that
        obtained by pouring aluminum sulfate or gold chloride into an
        alkaline solution of pyrogallol (1). </p>
      <p>[(1) For producing a rather lively phosphorescence there has
        been recently mentioned a mixture of: 10 cc 10% solution of
        pyrogallic acid, 20 cc 40% solution of potassium carbonate, 10
        cc 30% solution of formol. The above mixture should become
        phosphorescent by adding to it 30% of concentrated oxygenated
        water.] </p>
      <p>To arrive at a precise knowledge of the causes of
        phosphorescence by chemical reaction, it must be produced by
        reactions far more simple than those preceding -- the oxidation
        or hydration of well-defined compounds, for instance. This is
        what I have endeavored to realize. </p>
      <p>Phosphorescence by oxidation is exceptional. That of phosphorus
        is very probably not due to a simple oxidation only, as I have
        shown elsewhere. </p>
      <p>I have obtained other phosphoresences by oxidation, but they
        border on incandescence as much as on phosphorescence, and
        constitute perhaps a transition between the two. Such is notably
        the case with uranium. </p>
      <p>Let us take a strip of this metal about 1 mm thick, and place
        it on a plate heated to about 600° C. It becomes vividly
        brilliant. Withdraw it with pincers, and it continues to sine
        for two or three minutes, which would not happen if it were a
        simple phenomenon of incandescence that was in question. The
        same operation may be repeated several times, but the duration
        of the luminosity of the metal becomes shorter each time, and
        finally -- no doubt when it is entirely oxidized -- heat no
        longer produces any effect upon it. </p>
      <p>The only clearly defined reaction which allowed me to obtain
        phosphorescence is hydration. The best-defined cases are those
        of sulfates of quinine and cinchonine. Heated to 150° C, these
        salts lose part of their water, and after shining for an instant
        again become completely dark. When they have thus lost all their
        phosphorescence, they are allowed to cool; they become at once
        hydrated by contact with the air, again become phosphorescent,
        and at the same time radioactive. I shall not dwell upon this
        experiment, the details of which I have given in The Evolution
        of Matter. By reason of its considerable theoretical importance
        from the point of view of the causes of radioactivity, it has
        been the object of important papers abroad. The exactness of my
        observations has thus been clearly confirmed. </p>
      <p>It is possible, in the preceding experiment, to render the
        employment of heat completely useless. It is sufficient to mix
        quinine sulfate in a bottle with a little anhydrous phosphoric
        acid which at once dehydrates it. It is hydrated anew by simply
        breathing on its surface. Persons not previously informed of the
        theory of the operation are always much surprised when shown a
        body which becomes phosphorescent when breathed upon. </p>
      <p>Quinine sulfate is, of course, not the only compound which
        possesses the property of becoming phosphorescent by hydration.
        I have found a whole series of bodies offering the same
        phenomenon. Such, especially, are ordinary magnesia, commercial
        calcium sulfate, and hydrated alumina. </p>
      <p>These only differ from quinine sulfate by becoming
        phosphorescent by dehydration alone, instead of phosphorescing,
        like the first, both by hydration and by dehydration. Further,
        as these bodies become dehydrated slowly and with difficulty,
        they have to be heated to nearly 500 C for the phenomenon to be
        well marked. </p>
      <p>Phosphorescence is very easy to observe with calcium sulfate
        and especially with ordinary magnesia, which becomes very
        luminous when dehydrating. This is less apparent with alumina. </p>
      <p>If, after heating these compounds for some minutes until the
        phosphorescence is extinct, they are allowed to cool in the dark
        and then heated again, they again shine. But the luminosity is
        much greater if their hydration has been rendered more complete
        by moistening them with a little water before heating them. As
        soon as the heat is sufficient to produce dehydration, they
        become very phosphorescent. </p>
      <p>The phosphorescence thus obtained can be repeated indefinitely
        on the same body by simply moistening it the moment it is dried
        by the heat. This is not at all the case, as we have seen, with
        bodies made phosphorescent by a simple rise in temperature.
        Cooled and then heated again, these last no longer become
        phosphorescent unless in the meantime they have been exposed to
        the light. </p>
      <p>Salts of radium lose, as I have shown in my earlier work, their
        phosphorescence when hydrated. The very active ones regain it at
        once after having been dehydrated by heat, those slightly
        active, only some days after their dessication. </p>
      <p><b>4. Phosphorescence of Living Beings</b> </p>
      <p>The phosphorescence of living beings has for a long time been
        considered as a rather rare phenomenon manifested by a very
        small number of animals and vegetables. </p>
      <p>It has been observed, however, from remote antiquity. Besides
        the "sea of fire" necessarily known to all navigators by the
        presence of infusoria, the ancient authors have mentioned the
        phosphorescence of certain marine animals. Pliny pointed out
        that the liquid from the pholads renders luminous in the dark
        the lips and hands of those who eat this mollusk. Fisher
        relates, in his <i>Manual de Conchologie</i>, that Reaumur "has
        noted that fragments of these beings remain luminous after their
        separation from the body, and that when dried, they are able to
        emit light anew when moistened". </p>
      <p>Until recent years the number of phosphorescent animals known
        was somewhat restricted. No one could have suspected that the
        depths of the vast oceans, so long inaccessible, where reigned
        eternal night, were inhabited by innumerable luminous beings.
        Since suitable instruments have permitted have permitted the
        study of the inhabitants of seas at depths of several thousand
        meters, a complete new world has been revealed. </p>
      <p>It than became known that the bottom of the sea was covered
        with veritable forests of phosphorescent polyps; that the
        smallest as well as the most bulky of the beings inhabiting
        these dark depths often possessed organs enabling them to light
        themselves through the abysses in which they live. </p>
      <p>The phosphorescent organs of the marine animals reveal very
        different dispositions. Some are placed in different parts of
        the body; others in the eye itself, or above it, and it is quite
        correctly that the latter have been compared to bicycle lamps.
        Dr. Richard, curator of the collections of the Prince of Monaco,
        showed me a whole series of phosphorescent marine animals, and
        notably large fishes, possessing on each side of the body
        veritable lamps which they can mask at will. All these beings
        have been the subject of numerous studies, almost exclusively of
        an anatomical nature. </p>
      <p>In addition to the phosphorescent beings which people the
        depths of the sea, there should be quoted the luminous bacteria
        which appear on the bodies of fish after their death and before
        their decomposition. These bacteria can be cultivated very
        easily by the classic processes. An excellent culture can be
        made with ordinary water containing about 3% sea salt and 1%
        asparagine. It is with analogous products that were obtained the
        bottles sold by the name of "Living Light" at the Paris
        Exhibition of 1900. I have prepared some similar ones by simply
        scraping with a knife blade the scales of a herring and
        introducing the scrapings into bottles of the above liquid. At
        the end of 24 hours they possess a luminosity which lasts for 3
        or 4 days. </p>
      <p>Notwithstanding various researches we have not succeeded in
        determining the chemical bodies which produce this
        phosphorescence. We only know that it is a phenomenon which can
        survive the death of the animal. Carus had already seen that the
        luminous organs of the Italian lamprey, when dried and powdered,
        regained their lost phosphorescence on simply being moistened. </p>
      <p>These phenomena of the phosphorescence of living beings are
        certainly due to chemical actions requiring the presence of air
        and water. When these two elements are suppressed it disappears.
        It has been shown above that for certain well-defined bodies
        hydration is always accompanied by phosphorescence. </p>
      <p>The spectrum of the phosphorescence of living beings seems to
        present a few variations differing with the animals. It
        impresses the photographic plate very rapidly. I have been able
        to reproduce negatives with two minutes of exposure by taking as
        the source of light, fish which have become phosphorescent after
        death by the development of luminous bacteria. </p>
      <p>The phosphorescence of living beings presents, in its effects,
        close analogies to the phosphorescence produced by the various
        bodies we have already studied. It differs form them, in its
        causes, by being generated neither by light nor by heat. By its
        effects as well as by its causes, it is near akin to the
        phosphorescence by chemical reaction examined above. </p>
      <p><b>5. The Phosphorescence of Gases</b> </p>
      <p>The study of electric discharges in gases demonstrates the part
        played by electricity in the production of phosphorescence. The
        various causes studies above regarding this phenomenon, such as
        light and heat, act perhaps by indirectly exciting electric
        manifestations capable of producing phosphorescence. </p>
      <p>In the phosphorescence of gases the action of electricity is
        perfectly clear, since it alone can render them luminous. The
        highest temperatures, even when a whole meter of gas is heated,
        only gives them a hardly perceptible luminosity; whereas, if
        they are introduced in a rarified state into a tube through
        which an electric current is passed, they become greatly
        luminous. It is even sufficient to place the tube containing the
        rarified gas in the neighborhood of a high frequency resonator,
        or, again, to subject it to the action of electric waves. With
        tubes of helium, the luminosity is brilliant enough for it to be
        used to detect these last. </p>
      <p>The phosphorescence obtained by the electrification of gases is
        relatively bright, but up to late years there seemed no hope of
        rendering it intense enough for lighting purposes. </p>
      <p>The remarkable discovery of the mercury lamp has shown that
        lighting by phosphorescence was practicable, and proves once
        more to what a degree incandescence is independent of
        phosphorescence. </p>
      <p>It will be remembered that this lamp consists of a long glass
        rube furnished with electrodes -- one of iron, the other of
        mercury. If, after having made a vacuum in this tube, these two
        electrodes are connected to a source of electricity, the traces
        of gas and mercury vapor that it contains become brightly
        phosphorescent. In this luminosity there is evidently no
        phenomenon of incandescence, seeing that the temperature is only
        about 135° C -- that is to say, about much less than that
        necessary to render a body incandescent. The flame of a simple
        candle, as we know, has a temperature of about 1700° C. </p>
      <p>The spectrum of the phosphorescence of gases, such as that
        given by the mercury tube, contains very few red and infrared
        rays, although it has an output much higher than that of the
        ordinary incandescent light. To obtain this last there must
        first be produced an enormous quantity of invisible, and
        therefore useless, caloric rays. Our present process of
        artificial lighting is barbarous, as has been recognized for
        sometime. While the ideal method would be to produce only the
        visible and not the invisible part of the spectrum, a gas flame
        or the electric arc contains only 1 percent of useful rays, 99
        percent of the energy produced manifesting itself in the form of
        dark heat. With the phosphorescence of the mercury lamp, about
        40 percent seems to serve for lighting. The output of the
        phosphorescent animals, such as the glowworm, is higher still,
        since nearly the whole of the energy expended is transformed
        into visible light. Phosphorescence will probably be the
        artificial light of the future. </p>
      <p>It is not for this reason alone necessary to pursue the study
        of the phosphorescence of gases. I have always suggested that it
        was too costly for my modest researches, because I am persuaded
        that its thorough knowledge will open up new vistas on the
        greatest problems of physics and astronomy. </p>
      <p>Phosphorescence by electrical action gives, then, to atoms the
        same radiating properties as does heat. Intra-atomic energy
        ought to play some part in the production of this phenomenon,
        for the gases in the tubes described are strongly ionized --
        that is to say, dissociated by the passage of the current. </p>
      <p>It is probably to the influence of electric actions analogous
        to those of which the effects have just been shown that certain
        stars, composed, as their spectrum shows, of gas, owe their
        luminous brilliancy. Since gaseous bodies cannot shine by
        incandescence, as we have seen, other causes than heat must be
        sought for the light of many stars. </p>
      <p>But is some stars are luminous simply by electric actions
        similar to those studied, it would follow that the stars to
        which one attributes an enormous heat, may be on the contrary at
        a temperature relatively low. It is perhaps only at a certain
        phase of their existence that they shine by incandescence. </p>

        <b><font size="+1">The Causes of Phosphorescence</font></b></center>
      <p><b>1. Phosphorescence as a Manifestation of Intra-Atomic Energy</b>
      </p>
      <p>Phosphorescence represents the transformation into light of
        various energies of which only a few are known. In the case of
        gases we have seen that electric energy is the sole possible
        cause of the phosphorescence. In that due to the action of light
        and of heat, and of chemical reactions, other energies
        intervene, the mode of action of which is still undetermined. </p>
      <p>Since very different causes -- light, shock or impact, and
        x-rays -- may produce phosphorescence in the same substance,
        there is ground for believing that these very different
        excitants act by provoking the manifestation of reactions,
        which, if not identical, are at least of the same order. The old
        theory which considered phosphorescent bodies as simply
        restoring the light absorbed, as a sponge restores the water it
        has imbibed, is no longer tenable at the present day. </p>
      <p>The phenomenon of phosphorescence seems linked with that of the
        dissociation of matter, and with the liberation of energies
        which accompany this dissociation. The link is evident as regard
        the phosphorescence of gases, since the latter only become
        phosphorescent under the influence of electrical actions, which
        are always accompanied by ionization -- that is to say, by the
        disintegration of their atoms. </p>
      <p>As regards other forms of phosphorescence, the connection with
        dissociation is far less evident. It appears, however, at least
        probable in the case of phosphorescence by light, when we
        remember that light energetically dissociates matter, and that
        it is just the radiations producing this dissociation which are
        the most apt to produce phosphorescence. </p>
      <p>The tendency to consider phosphorescence as one of the
        consequences of the dissociation of atoms is beginning to take
        shape among physicists. De Heen and, after him, Lenard, have
        recently arrived at the conclusion that light acts by provoking
        the emission of negative ions issuing from the atom, and capable
        of returning to it by oscillation. </p>
      <p>To these movement of the elements of the dissociated atom
        should be due the radiation in the ether producing
        phosphorescence. Its light, of the same nature as that of
        incandescent bodies, differs from it by the absence of any
        elevation of temperature, which amply justifies the name of cold
        light sometimes given to it. It is possible that the rays of
        light, electricity, and the different causes of phosphorescence
        bring the intra-atomic energy immediately into play without its
        having to first pass through molecular movements, as in the case
        of heat. </p>
      <p>It is not strictly proven, moreover, that cold light is not in
        reality quite as hot as that generated by incandescence. If
        phosphorescence is a very superficial atomic phenomenon, it may
        be that the elevated temperature accompanying it is not
        appreciable, Crookes has observed that by exposing diamonds to
        the cathode bombardment, their surface is transformed into
        graphite -- which implies, according to Moissan, a temperature
        of 3600 C -- and yet the deeper strata of the diamond experience
        no notable elevation of temperature. The tube in which it is
        enclosed is very little heated. The same author has likewise
        observed that the surface of silver plate can be thus brought to
        a red heat, while the temperature of the whole mass of metal is
        hardly raised, notwithstanding the high conductivity of silver
        for heat. I must remark, however, that after rendering
        phosphorescent large masses of certain sulfides, spread out so
        as to have only a thickness of some hundredths of a millimeter,
        and afterwards collecting the mass in a flask, its temperature
        was not appreciably raised. </p>
      <p>The above consideration on the intra-atomic origins of
        phosphorescence only constitute the suggestion of an
        explanation; the complete solution of the problem is still far
        off. </p>
      <p>It is of importance to first thoroughly determine the reactions
        producing phosphorescence. They are of a special order, for
        which the laws of the early chemistry are of no service. How, in
        fact, could be have conceived that reactions bringing into play
        significant quantities of energy as, for example, the very
        slight hydration of a salt of quinine, could act on so stable a
        structure as an atom, and at the same time generate both
        radioactivity and phosphorescence. </p>
      <p>Without being able to entirely elucidate such phenomena, one
        can at least grasp its possibility by bearing in mind the
        notion, repeated referred to in the book, that the atom,
        notwithstanding its stability, may become unstable when we bring
        to bear upon it a suitable reagent. It then behaves somewhat
        like a tuning fork, which the most intense noise is powerless to
        shake, while a slight sound of suitable period will cause it to
        vibrate. A thin pencil of uv light will thus dissociate without
        difficulty the atoms of a block of steel capable of withstanding
        the most violent shocks. When a salt of quinine becomes very
        phosphorescent and radioactive solely by the addition of a
        thousandth part of its weight in water-vapor, we have simply --
        without, however, clearly knowing how -- excited reactions
        giving to the atoms of this body the instability which precedes
        dissociation. </p>
      <p><b>2. Special Character of the Chemical Reactions Giving to
          Bodies the Aptitude for Phosphorescence</b> </p>
      <p>What has been said will enable us to catch a glimpse of the
        reason why bodies, never phosphorescent under the influence of
        light when pure, acquire this property when we add to them a few
        hundred-thousandth parts of their weight -- that is to say,
        almost imponderable traces -- of foreign bodies. </p>
      <p>The sulfides of the alkaline earths and natural minerals are
        never phosphorescent in a state of purity. Certain bodies
        considered as very pure, such as the fluorite used to make
        lenses, crystallized apatite, etc., are, however,
        phosphorescent, but their pure state is only apparent. They
        always contain traces of foreign bodies. So does the diamond, as
        chemical analysis of it shows. </p>
      <p>It is the special combinations due to the presence of these
        foreign bodies which give to certain chemical compounds the
        aptitude for phosphorescence. Once formed, these combinations
        present some curious characteristics. Very movable, as is proved
        by the rapidity with which the different rays of light cause
        phosphorescence to appear or disappear, they nevertheless
        withstand energetic causes of destruction, since it takes 15
        hours of calcinations at red heat to deprive certain substances
        of their aptitude for phosphorescence. This calcinations in no
        wise acts by eliminating anything, since the regeneration of the
        combination and the aptitude for phosphorescence which ensues
        are obtained by passing induction sparks through the calcined
        bodies. Heat has not therefore eliminated any foreign body, but
        has simply destroyed the chemical combinations capable of being
        accompanied by phosphorescence, which reform under the influence
        of the electric spark. </p>
      <p>The foreign bodies capable of causing phosphorescence must
        always be present in infinitesimal proportions. Different
        substances may be substituted for one another to produce
        effects, if not identical, at all events analogous. M. Mourelo
        has shown that, to give strontium sulfide the property of
        becoming phosphorescent by heat, it has only to be calcined with
        a ten-thousandth part of a salt of manganese or of bismuth.
        Similar observations have been made with regard to the other
        sulfides. </p>
      <p>The early experiments of Becquerel prove that the slightest
        variation in the composition of the bodies in the mixture have
        an influence on their phosphorescence. Marble, chalk, Iceland
        spar, bodies chemically identical, since they are composed of
        calcium carbonate, when dissolved in nitric acid give calcium
        carbonates which we might suppose to be identical. They are not,
        however; since, by calcining with sulfur the calcium carbonates
        of various sources we obtain sulfides of calcium of which the
        phosphorescence may be yellow, green, or violet. The carbonates
        of lime employed have thus retained infinitesimal traces of
        foreign bodies varying with their origin. </p>
      <p>One of the most singular characteristics of the chemical
        combinations capable of giving to bodies the aptitude for
        phosphorescence by light is, as is said above, an extreme
        mobility -- that is to say, the faculty of being formed, and of
        being destroyed indefinitely, in an almost simultaneous fashion.
        Certain radiations produce phosphorescence in zinc sulfide in
        one-tenth of a second, and others destroy it in the same space
        of time. Different animals, such as the glow-worm, likewise
        possess this property of causing their phosphorescence to appear
        and disappear instantaneously. </p>
      <p>This notion of chemical reaction capable of being produced in
        the heart of perfectly solid bodies, such as diamonds, fluorite,
        and sulfides of alkaline earths, is evidently still outside the
        range of classic ideas. </p>
      <p>These last hardly admit, according to the adage of the early
        chemists, that bodies can act on one another save in a state of
        solution; nor do they admit combination in proportions neither
        simple nor definite. Chemical science, moreover, has no
        knowledge of combinations which can almost instantaneously be
        made, unmade, and remade indefinitely under such slight
        influences as a ray of light. </p>
      <p>Of what do these combinations consist where one of the elements
        is in an infinitely small proportion relatively to the other? </p>
      <p>We know by all that has been said that the combinations which
        render phosphorescence possible realize the following
        conditions: (1) The bodies, the addition of which produces
        combinations accompanied by phosphorescence when excited by
        light or by heat, ought to be added in very small proportions;
        (2) the combinations formed are mobile and capable of being
        regenerated, since they are destroyed and remade in a small
        fraction of a second; (3) these combinations, so rapidly
        destroyed and so rapidly regenerated, are intimately connected
        with the action of the temperatures, which, when it is raised,
        destroys them very quickly, and very slowly when it is
        sufficiently low. The phosphorescent body emits for months
        invisible radiations. The return of the combination to its
        primitive state is completely stopped at a still lower
        temperature, and the body preserves it phosphorescence
        indefinitely until its temperature is raised. </p>
      <p>Apart from phosphorescent bodies we do not know any chemical
        combinations able to realize these various conditions, and
        simple mixtures certainly do not do so. We are therefore obliged
        to admit that we have to do with an utterly unknown order of
        chemical reactions. They will probably remain unknown for a long
        time, because their extreme instability and the ease with which
        they are destroyed and regenerated protect them against all
        processes of chemical analysis in present use. To determine the
        bodies present is of no use, since it is the combinations formed
        by them which we want to grasp. </p>
      <p>The problem is further complicated, because the foreign bodies,
        the combinations whereof induces the aptitude for
        phosphorescence, seem only to act by giving instability to the
        atom so as to allow it to liberate the energies it contains. </p>
      <p>We are hardly in reality beginning to suspect the causes of
        phosphorescence, but that which we catch a glimpse of enables us
        to feel by anticipation that it will constitute one of the most
        important chapters of chemistry, and will surely be linked with
        the history, as yet hardly outlined, of the dissociation of
        matter. </p>

      </center>
      <p><b>1. The Divisions of Black Light</b> </p>
      <p>The appearance in 1896 of the work of Roentgen on the x-rays
        determined me to publish immediately in order to settle the
        order of dates, a note on some particular radiations capable of
        passing through bodies, which I had been studying for two years
        and which were attached to no known phenomena. I called them by
        the name of Black Light by reason of their sometimes acting like
        light while remaining invisible. </p>
      <p>These radiations, which I had not had time to separate, at that
        period, were composed of three very distinct elements: (1)
        Radioactive particles of the family of cathode rays; (2)
        radiations of great wavelength; (3) radiations due to invisible
        phosphorescence. I have already set forth in The Evolution of
        Matter how I managed to distinguish these different elements in
        their order. </p>
      <p>The first of the three categories of radiations enumerated
        being identical with the cathode rays and radioactive emissions,
        it would be useless now to give them a special name. I shall
        therefore only designate by the name of Black Light: (1) the
        invisible radiations, totally unknown before my researches,
        emitted by certain phosphorescent bodies; and (2) the radiations
        of great wavelength, belonging to the infrared part of the
        spectrum. This region has been known for a long time, but the
        majority of its properties have been ignored. It was not
        suspected before my researches that these radiations passed
        through a great number of bodies, allowed instantaneous
        photography in the dark, and possessed very special
        physiological actions. </p>
      <p>The first category of radiations enumerated above have the same
        composition as ordinary light, and only differ from it by their
        invisibility. Designating them, together with those of the
        infrared, under the term Black Light, completes the continuous
        scale of invisible radiations. </p>
      <p>Black Light, then, comprises: (1) the invisible light emitted
        by certain phosphorescent bodies; (2) the invisible infrared
        light which in the solar spectrum goes up to 5 microns, and
        possesses consequently an extent ten times superior to that of
        the visible spectrum. </p>
      <p>I will now study the division of the Black Light constituted by
        invisible phosphorescence. </p>
      <p><b>2. History of Invisible Phosphorescence</b> </p>
      <p>When I published in 1899 and 1900 the experiments to the
        description of which this chapter is devoted, they seemed so
        astonishing to physicists that they preferred not to believe
        them. Yet the verification of the most fundamental of them was
        extremely easy, and demanded no other expense than 50 centimes
        in money and a few minutes of time. I now know, however, that
        several repeated them, but, astonished at their success,
        preferred not to speak of results which were evidently of no
        account, since official science had not consecrated them. Even
        today it is with great timidity that they are noticed in a few
        treatises on physics. Thus, for example, a distinguished
        scholar, M. Gariel, Prof. of Physics at the Faculte de Medicine
        de Paris, after having given a summary of them, says: "These
        effects are almost extraordinary. There is no occasion, however,
        to put them on one side, for the phenomena relating to
        radiations are certainly not yet all known" (<i>Physique
          Biologique</i>, vol. 11, p. 261). This quotation at least
        shows that if the discovery of new facts is sometimes difficult,
        it is still more difficult to get them admitted. </p>
      <p>The invisible phosphorescence which I discovered is
        characterized by the following phenomena: (1) A phosphorescent
        body exposed to the light preserves for a period of about 18
        months the property of emitting invisible radiations capable of
        refraction and polarization, and of impressing photographic
        plates. The spectrum of these radiations, which is analogous to
        that of light, only differs from it by its invisibility. (2) At
        the end of these 18 months, the body has no longer any
        appreciable radiation, but preserves indefinitely a residuum
        which can be made visible by projecting on its surface dark
        infrared radiations. </p>
      <p>These phenomena were completely unknown, and nothing warranted
        their being foreseen. No doubt it was known from all time that
        many bodies are phosphorescent by heat, and consequently have
        preserved since their geological formation an aptitude for
        phosphorescence which appears as soon as they are heated. But as
        these bodies radiate absolutely nothing in the dark before being
        heated, they give birth to no invisible phosphorescence. That
        which they manifest by heat is a very visible phosphorescence. </p>
      <p>Notwithstanding their long researches on phosphorescence, E.
        and H. Becquerel were ignorant of the phenomenon of invisible
        phosphorescence. Never did they suspect that bodies on which
        light had fallen for a minute could spontaneously emit in the
        dark invisible radiations during many long months. While
        knowing, as Canton had observed, that a phosphorescent sulfide,
        heated some time after insolation, again became slightly
        luminous for an instant, E. Becquerel supposed that the
        spontaneous emission of radiations quickly ceased, and that heat
        was necessary to expel the slight phosphorescent residue
        preserved indeed, but, according to him, never for long. This
        is, moreover, what he says in his book on Light (vol. 1, pp. 52
        and 59): "When these substances are exposed to sunlight and
        placed in profound darkness for a short time -- say, for 3 or 4
        days -- they almost entirely lose the faculty of shining
        immediately by a rise in temperature. Thus, the modification
        acquired by the action of radiation is only preserved in part
        and for a certain time in phosphorescent bodies, and then
        disappears". </p>
      <p>The spontaneous invisible radiation produced without any
        intervention of temperature had thus escaped the notice of this
        eminent physicist. It is not at all true that "the modification
        acquired by the action of radiation is only preserved for a
        certain time, and then finally disappears". We shall see that a
        part of the modifications impressed by light on phosphorescent
        bodies is preserved indefinitely and even after they have ceased
        to emit any invisible phosphorescence, which, however, only
        happens at the end of about 18 months. </p>
      <p>There are two forms of invisible phosphorescence: (1) the one
        following visible phosphorescence; (2) the one preceding it.
        They can both be easily transformed into visible light. </p>
      <p><b>3. Properties of Invisible Phosphorescence</b> </p>
      <p>The invisible phosphorescence which follows the visible
        constitutes one of the least known and most curious forms of
        light. It would have been difficult, before my experiments, to
        foresee that a body exposed for a minute to the sun and then
        kept in darkness for 18 months preserve the property of
        emitting, without cessation, radiations identical with light and
        only differing from it by an absolute invisibility. </p>
      <p>The majority of bodies struck by light preserve sometimes for a
        very long time the property of emitting dark radiations capable
        of impressing photographic plates. But it is with those capable
        of first acquiring phosphorescence that the phenomenon can be
        best studied. </p>
      <p>First, here are the experiments by which I determined the
        properties of the light thus emitted. </p>
      <p>(1) Duration of the emission and variation in the intensity of
        the rays emitted as a function of the time ~ Calcium sulfide in
        powder placed between two strips of glass is exposed to the
        light for a few seconds, and then transferred to the drawer of a
        cupboard placed in a dark room in which no light has penetrated
        during the course of the experiments -- that is to say, for
        several years. At the end of 24 hours the screen has become
        entirely dark. Without taking it from the dark room, it is
        placed on a photographic negative, under which is placed a
        gelatino-bromide plate. Still keeping in darkness the system
        thus constituted, the following is observed: </p>
      <p>Three days after the insolation, a very vigorous image of the
        negative is obtained in two hours. At the end of 15 days the
        exposure has to be for 12 hours; after 25 days, 30 hours; after
        6 months, 40 days. At the end of 18 months traces of the image
        can still be obtained after an exposure of 60days. </p>
      <p>The above proves that the residual charge given by two seconds
        exposure to the sun has taken 18 months to gradually disappear.

      <p>(2) Propagation in a straight line, and refraction ~ The
        propagation in a straight line and the refraction of the dark
        light which remains are shown by the following experiment: </p>
      <p>A statue coated with calcium sulfide dissolved in copal varnish
        is exposed for a few seconds to the light. Three or four days
        after it has become entirely dark, it is placed in a
        photographic dark room in a cellar into which the daylight has
        never entered. The focusing has been arranged beforehand. By
        using a portrait camera with large aperture, we obtain, by
        exposures varying from 8 to 15 days, images as perfect as those
        taken in daylight. The shadows vary at the will of the operator,
        since they depend solely on the position given to the stature
        during the insolation. </p>

      </center>
      <p>(3) Polarization ~ The double refraction and consequent
        polarization of this dark light are shown by the following
        experiment: A strip of Iceland spar is introduced into the optic
        system of the camera previously used, and the statue is replaced
        by two glass tubes in the form of a cross, filled with sulfide
        and fixed in a place settled beforehand so as to obtain a good
        focus. By working as before, a few days after the sulfide has
        ceased to emit light, we see on one of the exes of the cross two
        partially superposed images, of which the intensity is one half
        less than that of the part not duplicated -- which is in
        conformity with the theory (Figure 26). </p>
      <p>This experiment proves, at the same time, the emission of
        invisible radiations, their propagation in a straight line,
        their refraction, and their aptitude for polarization. </p>
      <p>(4) Composition of the Rays emitted ~ The perfect sharpness of
        the images obtained in the preceding experiments already proves
        that the index of refraction of the lenses for dark rays is the
        same as for visible light. Had it been otherwise, the
        preliminary focusing by ordinary light would not have been exact
        for rays of different wavelength, especially with the portrait
        camera employed, of which the focal depth is almost nil. But
        that is only an indication. To ascertain the composition of the
        active rays, it would have been necessary to disperse them by a
        prism and to photograph them. This experiment was not realizable
        on account of the necessity of employing, in order to obtain
        fairly clear photographs of the prismatic spectra, a very fine
        slit which absorbs nearly the whole of the light. The difficulty
        has been obviated by employing an artificial spectrum, composed
        of bands of colored glass fixed on a strip of colorless crown
        glass. This spectrum was first exposed to ordinary light over a
        sensitive plate, and the image thus obtained, after development,
        was compared with successive images obtained by interposing the
        artificial spectrum between the dark screen of sulfide and the
        sensitive plate. The images were identical in the two cases --
        that is to say, nil from the red to the green, and very intense
        under the blue glass. </p>
      <p>From these experiments we may conclude: -- (1) That there is
        identity of composition between the visible solar light and the
        dark light emitted by bodies exposed to luminous radiations for
        a moment. The second only differs from the first by its
        invisibility, which results from the small amplitude of the
        waves emitted. (2) That this residual and invisible light lasts
        for a long time. </p>
      <p><b>4. Persistence of the Aptitude for Phosphorescence after
          Cessation of the Spontaneous Radiation -- Transformation of
          Invisible Phosphorescence into Visible</b> </p>
      <p>We have just seen that certain phosphorescent bodies can for 18
        months emit invisible radiations, but that a time arrives when
        the emission ceases entirely. We shall now see that those dark
        bodies, which after a period of radiation so long seem to have
        lost all their energy, preserve indefinitely a certain provision
        of residual phosphorescence. We shall render it visible at any
        moment -- after a 10 years’ stay in the dark, for example -- by
        letting certain invisible radiations fall on the surface of
        these bodies. They then become brightly phosphorescent enough to
        be photographed in a few minutes in the dark room. </p>
      <p>I noted this fact for the first time with calcium sulfide
        screens which had been used for my former experiments, and which
        no longer gave photographic impressions at the end of 18 months,
        even after 6 weeks’ exposure. They were then left in the dark,
        where they still are after more than 10 years. </p>
      <p>Let us put one of those screens in the dark into a
        plate-carrier, and cover over the glass with a sheet of black
        paper or a plate of ebonite, bodies opaque to ordinary light,
        but very transparent, as has been shown, to dark radiations of
        great wavelength. Let us expose this plate-carrier for 20 or 25
        seconds to a paraffin lamp, and then take it into the dark to
        open and examine it. We shall find that, under the influence of
        the invisible radiations, the screen, which has been dark for so
        many years, has become luminous. Its phosphorescence is
        sufficient to give a photographic impression by contact in two
        or three minutes, while before it did not give one after 6
        weeks’ exposure. </p>
      <p>The phosphorescence thus produced disappears rapidly, but the
        experiment can be repeated with the same screen more than 50
        times at certain intervals -- that is to say, for an indefinite
        number of years. There naturally arrives a moment when, the
        phosphorescent residue being exhausted by these successive
        experiments, the dark rays will produce no effect unless the
        screen is subjected to a fresh insolation. It is therefore
        really a case of a limited residual charge, which does not renew
        itself spontaneously, but which we can keep indefinitely before
        expending it. </p>
      <p>A large number of bodies possess in this way the property of
        acquiring a provision of residual light, a part of which
        disappears spontaneously, while the other part is preserved
        indefinitely. With some of them, such as calcium and strontium
        sulfide, the invisible residual light may become visible simply
        under the influence of dark radiations of great wavelength, even
        when the screen exposed to these radiations is maintained at a
        very low temperature -- for example, between two glass troughs a
        centimeter thick, full of ice. Heat therefore cannot be given as
        the cause of the phenomenon. It is important to note this, for
        heat by itself can produce the same effect if we raise the
        temperature to 30° C. The action produced by heat is, moreover,
        very different from that generated by the dark radiation, as
        will presently be shown. </p>
      <p>The above experiments succeed very well with several
        phosphorescent sulfides, especially that of calcium, but not at
        all with zinc sulfide. The reason of this, to which I shall
        return elsewhere, is that the radiations of great wavelength,
        capable of destroying the phosphorescence of this sulfide, are
        totally incapable of exciting it. Zinc sulfide, like other
        sulfides, retain a residual charge indefinitely, but this
        residual charge can only be expelled by a temperature
        approaching 100° C, and not at all by the dark infrared rays. </p>
      <p>Many other bodies -- the diamond, for instance -- exist which
        can indefinitely retain a residual phosphorescence, which may be
        rendered visible by heat, and not by the infrared rays. A
        Brazilian diamond exposed to the sun acquired a phosphorescence
        which vanishes rapidly; but it retains an invisible
        phosphorescence which can be rendered visible after a few years
        by heating it to about 200° C. </p>
      <p>Instead of effecting the preceding experiments with
        phosphorescent screens requiring some little preparation, they
        can be realized more simply by placing the calcium sulfide in a
        tube placed, after insolation, in a box closed by a sheet of
        ebonite, or, better still, by a sheet of glass coated with the
        so-called Japanese varnish, in a layer thick enough for the sun
        to be invisible through it (1). At the end of 24 hours, the
        sulfide will no longer shine, but when kept in the dark it will
        retain indefinitely the faculty of becoming luminous when the
        invisible radiation above referred to fall on its surface. </p>
      <p>[(1) To get the layer of the required thickness, put a little
        raised border of cardboard around the glass. The layer may be of
        any thickness. I have observed that a thickness of one cm is
        easily traversed by the infrared radiations. The only
        inconvenience of over-thick layers is that they take more than a
        week to dry. However, a layer of 1 mm is sufficient to give an
        absolute opacity to the eye, which can be tested by holding it
        up between the latter and the sun.] </p>
      <p>To prove this, we have only to expose for one minute the box
        containing the calcium sulfide tube to a paraffin lamp. On
        afterwards opening it in the dark, it will be seen that the tube
        has become luminous. It is this very easy experiment that I
        alluded to at the beginning of this chapter. </p>
      <p>To render the preceding experiments still more demonstrative, I
        place at the bottom of a large cardboard box, closed as
        indicated above, some bas-reliefs coated with a layer of calcium
        sulfide, dissolved in bronzing varnish. This box is left in the
        dark. If, at some later period, it is exposed, still closed, to
        a lamp for two minutes, and then opened in a dark room, the
        statues will be luminous. The operation may be carried out
        several weeks after insolation. </p>
      <p>Up till now we have always used, to excite the extinguished
        phosphorescence, visible radiations passing through an opaque
        screen, which renders them invisible. But the experiment in this
        form allows it to be supposed that visible light has been able
        to pass through a chink in the box and to illumine the sulfide.
        We will now suppress all visible sources of light, place the
        observer in complete darkness, and in this darkness cause
        gradually to appear before his eyes a luminous statue which no
        ray of visible light has touched. </p>
      <p><b>Figure 27</b> </p>

        <p><img src="1fig27.jpg" height="328" width="365"></p>
      </center>
      <p>Though very striking, this experiment is most simple, and
        easily deduced from what is said above. The reader who has
        thoroughly understood my explanations sees at once that, if we
        shut up the lamp in an opaque box instead of the statue, the
        result will be the same. The operation is as follows: -- </p>
      <p>In a dark room, or, if you do not have one, at night, the dark
        lamp described above, which allows no visible light to pass, is
        placed on a table. In front of it is a statuette coated with
        calcium sulfide which has been left for several days in the
        dark, and consequently presents no trace of phosphorescence. All
        being thus prepared, the observer sees, at the end of one or two
        minutes, the statue light up and come forth from the darkness. </p>
      <p>The experiment is a very curious one, and has always vividly
        impressed the spectator. It is, in fact, very strange to see the
        dark radiations of the lamp, added to the dark radiations of the
        sulfide, produce visible light. It is almost the converse of the
        celebrated interference experiment of Fresnel, in which light
        added to light produced darkness. In my experiment, it is
        darkness added to darkness which gives birth to light. </p>
      <p>The light thus obtained is not very vivid. It is enough so,
        however, to enable a photograph of the statue to be takes with
        an exposure of 40 minutes, with a portrait camera suitably
        placed beforehand. The dark lamp, of course, is kept near the
        statue all the time the operation lasts, for if it were taken
        away, the phosphorescence would extinguish itself in less than a
        minute. Figure 28 gives the reproduction of statuettes obtained
        by these means. </p>

      </center>
      <p>The above proves that the residual luminosity stored up by
        certain bodies is formed of a transitory elements and a
        permanent one, both being capable of transformation into visible
        light. But while the transitory element disappears spontaneously
        by radiation in a greater or less space of time, the permanent
        element does not radiate spontaneously, but persists
        indefinitely until artificially expelled, either by calcinations
        or, without any rise in the temperature, by exposing the body to
        dark radiations of a certain wavelength. </p>
      <p><b>5. Invisible Phosphorescence Preceding the Visible</b> </p>
      <p>The invisible phosphorescence which, as we have just seem,
        follows the visible, may precede it. This is proved by the
        following experiments. </p>
      <p>Let us take a screen made of a phosphorescent body which is
        slowly impressed by light, such as strontium sulfide, and
        deprive it, by heat, of all residual phosphorescence. Let us
        then place it in the plate-carrier of a camera obscura having a
        diaphragm timed to 1/5 second, point the apparatus towards the
        sky, and uncover the diaphragm so that the plate is exposed to
        light for that period. On opening the frame afterwards in the
        dark, we notice that the sulfide is not luminous, but it will
        suffice to place it on a plate heated to 200° C for illumination
        to occur. Its short exposure to the light had thus given it an
        invisible phosphorescence. </p>
      <p>The experiment may be effected more simply with other bodies --
        Iceland spar, for example. This compound acquires a very slight
        visible phosphorescence by heat and none by light, but if
        insolated and then heated to 200° C, it shines with brilliance
        for some minutes, which proves that the light communicates to it
        a certain quantity if invisible phosphorescence. This series of
        operations can be repeated indefinitely -- that is to say, we
        can restore to the spar the same luminosity by heat after having
        insolated it. </p>
      <p><b>6. Comparative Effects on Phosphorescence of the Infrared
          Radiations and of Heat</b> </p>
      <p>The first observers, having studied the action of the various
        parts of the spectrum on bodies capable of phosphorescence, very
        soon noted that the radiations going from the blue to the
        ultraviolet produced phosphorescence, and that those from the
        green to far on in the infrared extinguished it. </p>
      <p>H. Becquerel believed that he had found the explanation of this
        destructive action of the infrared, by saying that it acted
        simply as a source of heat, and consequently obliged the body to
        expend very quickly its provision of phosphorescence. This
        explanation has, from that time, been repeated in all standard
        works on physics. </p>
      <p>Yet it only required very simple experiments to show that it
        was founded on a mere appearance, which, moreover, does not
        exist with all phosphorescent bodies. The following experiments
        enable the parts played by the infrared rays and heat to be
        clearly differentiated. </p>
      <p>Fasten on the same cardboard two small screens, one of calcium
        sulfide, the other of zinc sulfide, and expose them, after
        insolation, to the infrared radiations of our dark lamp. The
        calcium sulfide will become more brilliant, but the zinc sulfide
        becomes extinguished directly without any increase in light. </p>
      <p>But this is only a first indication. I shall show that heat and
        infrared exercise on phosphorescence two very different actions.
        They may be added together, whence the error of interpretation
        pointed out above, but one of them may also act in the contrary
        way to the other. </p>
      <p>We will first examine the case in which these two effects, the
        specific action of certain radiations and of heat, seem
        identical. </p>
      <p>Let us take a screen of calcium sulfide, which has been
        insolated for 15 minutes, and expose it to the action of our
        dark lamp, either in front of the metallic chimney, or of the
        part closed by ebonite which allows the infrared to pass. In
        both cases the phosphorescence will first be made more active
        and then extinguished. Only the action of the heat is slower
        than that of the infrared, because it only acts when the surface
        of the screen has had time to get heated. </p>
      <p>The same results occur if we employ a screen which has been
        insolated for a few days and is consequently dark. It will shine
        in front of all parts of the black lamp -- that is to say, by
        the action of heat as well as by that of the infrared. </p>
      <p>By confining ourselves to these experiments we should arrive at
        the conclusion, as did the earlier observers, that the infrared
        rays acted by heating the phosphorescent screen. </p>
      <p>To show the inaccuracy of this interpretation, we will repeat
        the preceding experiment, but interpose between the screen of
        sulfide and the lamp a strip of glass to prevent the heating of
        the phosphorescent matter. The effects will then be very
        different. </p>
      <p>In front of the ebonite, a region low in temperature, but which
        allows many of the infrared rays to pass, there will still be
        illumination. In front of the chimney of the lamp, a region
        fairly warm and acting as a heated body, there is no longer any
        illumination. The strip of glass interposed, which prevents the
        action of heat, prevents likewise the phosphorescence. It is
        therefore evident that the action of heat and of radiations of
        great wavelength are very different. </p>
      <p>It evidently might be objected to the above that if the
        infrared possesses the specific action I ascribe to it apart
        from the caloric power, the chimney of the lamp of which the
        action is prevented by the interposition of a glass should have
        an effect, since it produces infrared rays to the same extent as
        heated bodies. But as the heat of the walls of this chimney
        hardly exceed 100° C., the waves emitted have a length not less
        than 5 to 6 microns, and these have no specific effect on
        phosphorescence. They act solely by the heat they are able to
        produce after a certain lapse of time, which is why the
        interposition of a strip of glass suppresses all such action.
        Through ebonite, blackened glass, etc., there are emitted
        radiations of about 0.8 up to 3 microns, which possess a
        specific action independent of the caloric effect which they
        must produce in the course of time, and that is the reason they
        instantaneously act on phosphorescence. </p>
      <p>To render the above theory still more convincing, I will now
        show that the infrared can produce on the two halves of the same
        screen contrary effects, the one by its specifics, the other by
        its caloric action. </p>
      <p>For the calcium sulfide screen, let us substitute one of zinc
        sulfide with green phosphorescence. Let us insolate it by
        daylight, place one half in front of the metallic chimney of the
        lamp (that is to say, in front of a source of heat), and the
        other half in front of the ebonite which masks the flame and
        allows the infrared radiations to pass. On the two halves of the
        screen, the effects will be diametrically opposite. In front of
        the ebonite, the screen will become at once extinguished,
        without any preliminary increase of the phosphorescence. In
        front of the metal chimney, its phosphorescence will be, on the
        contrary, markedly increased. </p>
      <p>If, instead of having been insolated before exposure to the
        lamp, the zinc sulfide screen has remained for some time in a
        dark room, so that it no longer manifests any visible
        phosphorescence, the difference of action between heat and the
        infrared radiations will still continue to show itself. The
        screen will again become phosphorescent before the heated metal
        wall, and will remain dark before the ebonite, since the rays
        cannot destroy its visible phosphorescence owing to its being
        already extinguished (1). </p>
      <p>[(1) In all these experiments in which luminous fields of
        unequal intensity are compared, it is well to put on the screens
        (on the side facing the lamp) a narrow sheet of tin, which
        preserves the intensity which they would have had without having
        been exposed to any radiation.] </p>
      <p>These experiments put in evidence the fundamental differences
        existing between the effect of heat and the specific action of
        certain radiations. </p>
      <p>The above demonstration may be completed by enclosing the
        phosphorescent screen between two troughs of frozen water 1 cm
        thick, before placing it in front of the infrared radiation of
        the lamp. Though its surface cannot, under these conditions,
        become heated, there will be observed in front of the ebonite
        effects of illumination in the case of the calcium sulfide, and
        extinction in the case of the zinc sulfide, as already
        described. </p>
      <p>It is therefore evident that infrared radiations may have
        specific actions quite independent of those produced by raising
        the temperature of the bodies absorbing them. </p>
      <p>Our experiments having proved that heat and infrared radiations
        are able in some cases to produce similar effects on certain
        phosphorescent sulfides -- especially that of calcium -- it
        became of interest to inquire to what temperature these bodies
        should be brought in order to obtain by heating them effects
        identical with those obtained at a low temperature with infrared
        radiations. Nothing can be easier, since it suffices to
        determine the temperature at which calcium sulfide, after being
        insolated for a few days, and thereby darkened, can regain its
        luminosity. This is effected by placing it in tubes introduced
        into a receptacle full of water containing in it a thermometer,
        and heating it gradually in darkness. We thus become aware that
        calcium sulfide which has been insolated for 8 days only
        commences to shine at 60° C, and not before 55 seconds, the time
        necessary to heat it. The same tube of sulfide becomes, on the
        contrary, instantaneously luminous when exposed at a low
        temperature to the action of infrared radiations. </p>
      <p>One may also wish to discover how much phosphorescence the
        infrared is capable if taking away from luminous sulfides, and
        thus fix its caloric equivalent. This is effected by introducing
        into a photographic plate-carrier, with a thin shutter of
        ebonite, a screen of calcium sulfide, and exposing it to the sun
        for several hours. It is then observed that, to restore its
        phosphorescence, it must be raised to a temperature slightly
        above 100° C. The great radiations acting at the ordinary
        temperature have therefore taken from a phosphorescent body all
        the residual light it might lose by heating it to about 100° C.
      </p>
      <p><b>7. Radiations of the Metals and of Different
          Non-Phosphorescent Bodies</b> </p>
      <p>With invisible phosphorescence there are apparently -- but only
        apparently -- connected certain impressions obtained by bodies
        placed in contact, and in the dark, with a sensitive
        photographic plate. A gelatino-bromide plate is placed in a dark
        slide under a strip of metal -- zinc, aluminum, or platinum. By
        interposing between the strip and the metal a cross made of
        various substances, we generally obtain, after a few hours
        exposure to the sun or to a strong paraffin lamp, an image of
        the object interposed, even when it is separated from the metal
        by a thin plate of mica. </p>
      <p>This experiment, and others of the same order which in former
        years caused me to waste much time, succeed very irregularly,
        and at the end of a few days the metal no longer gives any
        image. </p>

      </center>
      <p>These effects are in no way connected with phosphorescence, but
        with the radioactivity of the metal, and this is the reason that
        they can be increased by slight heat. The absence of action on
        the metal -- its fatigue, if we may call it so -- is likewise
        observed, as I have shown, in the discharge of the electroscope.
        It is owing to the fact of the metal having expelled, under the
        influence of slight heat, a provision of radioactive substance,
        which cannot be regenerated without a long rest, that it becomes
        inactive. </p>
      <p>These radioactive actions, which I confused at the beginning of
        my experiments with those of the infrared and invisible
        phosphorescence, were the cause of many researches before I
        could distinguish them. From time to time different observers
        come across my early experiments, and, as Dr Russell, Dr
        Kahlbaum, and Prof Melander have done, observe afresh such
        impressions. The causes of these being determined, these
        experiments no longer present any great interest, and that is
        why I do not dwell on them. </p>
      <p>It is not metals alone, as I have already said, which may give
        such impressions, but wood and animal tissues also produce them
        [N-rays? -- Ed.]. They are made more active by slight heat; but
        it is evident that with these different substances certain
        chemical reactions may also come into play. </p>

        <b><font size="+1">The Infrared Rays and Photography Through
            Opaque Bodies</font></b></center>
      <p><b>1. Visibility through Opaque Bodies</b> </p>
      <p>We have seen that the greater part of the solar spectrum is
        formed of invisible rays situated in the region of the infrared,
        and extending for sunlight up to 5 microns, according to the
        researches of Langley. The spectrum of flames is much longer
        still, and extends up to 60 microns. </p>
      <p>This very important region has hardly been studied hitherto,
        except from the point of view of its caloric properties. Having
        discovered that zinc sulfide with green phosphorescence was
        nearly as sensitive to a part of these radiations as was
        gelatino-bromide of silver to visible light, I was able to study
        their properties, especially the one of passing through a great
        number of opaque bodies. They allow us to see and to photograph
        through these last. These phenomena will be dealt with here, and
        the other actions of the infrared will be examined in a future
        chapter. </p>
      <p>For the eye to discern an object placed behind a body supposed
        to be opaque -- a wooden plank or a piece of black paper, for
        example -- it is evidently necessary that the rays should first
        pass through it. It is afterwards necessary that the eye should
        be rendered sensitive to these rays. </p>
      <p>The first of these conditions having always been considered as
        impossible, no one could dream of realizing the second. </p>
      <p>The discovery of x-rays proved that opaque bodies can, indeed,
        be traversed by certain radiations, but the properties of these
        radiations, created artificially by our instruments, could not
        modify the old ideas as to the opacity of bodies for light. The
        ancient fable of the lynx, whose sparkling eyes could see
        through walls, seemed destined to remain the most unrealizable
        of chimeras. </p>
      <p>This, however, is not the case. By pursuing my researches on
        the whole of the radiations designated by the name of Black
        Light, I was led to establish: (1) that the luminous rays, or at
        all events certain of them, passed without difficulty through a
        large number of opaque bodies; (2) that the invisible rays which
        pass through them can be easily rendered visible. </p>
      <p>If, then, our eye does not see through opaque bodies, it is not
        because luminous rays do no pass through, but because our retina
        is insensitive to these rays. If the eye of the lynx does not
        really possess the property conferred on it in the old legends,
        there is no scientific reason why it should not. It would be
        very easy to imagine an eye but little different from ours, and,
        moreover, possibly possessed by nocturnal animals, which should
        have the property of seeing through opaque bodies. </p>
      <p><b>Figure 30</b> </p>

        <p><img src="1fig30.jpg" height="227" width="374"></p>
      </center>
      <p>It is this artificial eye, sensitive to radiations invisible to
        the human retina, which is realized by the following
        experiments. </p>
      <p>By means of a heliostat and a lens a pencil of light is
        conducted on to the collimator of a direct vision prism, and the
        spectrum is received, in the dark, on a screen of zinc sulfide
        gradated in wavelengths according to the formula of the prism
        used. This screen is previously rendered sensitive by a short
        exposure to light. </p>
      <p>After this exposure and before causing the spectrum to act on
        the screen, a portion of the part on which it is to fall is
        covered by a layer of the opaque body of which it is desired to
        study the transparency -- say a sheet of black paper. By cutting
        off the spectrum after a moment and displacing the opaque strip,
        we immediately seem by the partial blackening of the
        phosphorescent screen under it, the region of the spectrum which
        has passed through it. It extends from 0.8 to 3 microns. </p>
      <p><b>Figure 31</b> </p>

        <p><img src="1fig32.jpg" height="258" width="354"></p>
      </center>
      <p>Now let us examine how, by utilizing the properties of these
        radiation, a body enclosed in an opaque case may be rendered
        visible. We have simply to follow the explanations given below
        the above figure. In a few seconds the object enclosed in a box
        is seen outlined on the screen which covers it. </p>
      <p>The luminous source of which the rays pass through the opaque
        body is a paraffin lamp covered with black paper. The operator
        is therefore in complete darkness, in the midst of which there
        appears on the screen the objects contained in the opaque box. </p>
      <p>Of the various experiments realizable by the above process, the
        most striking is that of the visibility of an object enclosed in
        a box. This being placed in front of the invisible lamp, we see
        gradually appearing out of the total darkness in which the
        operator is the image of the enclosed object. When working with
        transparent screens of large size the effect is surprising. </p>
      <p>The invisible luminous rays are much less penetrating than the
        x-rays, and can in no way claim to take their place. </p>
      <p>At the time of my first experiments in photography through
        opaque bodies, I was not aware of the sensitiveness of zinc
        sulfide to the infrared rays, and I made use of photographic
        plates rendered sensitive to radiations of great wavelength by
        having them previously made cloudy. The exposures then lasted
        hours instead of seconds. I reproduce later (Figure 40) one of
        the images thus obtained. </p>
      <p>The above experiments needing a little attention and some care,
        I have sought to supplement them by others which only demand an
        infinitesimal amount of attention and no apparatus. The
        following one enables a body enclosed in an opaque receptacle to
        be seen: </p>
      <p>A sheet of black paper is fixed on a glass plate, and on its
        surface is fastened a cross cut out of a thin strip of tin. This
        cross is covered with a second sheet of black paper, so that it
        is imprisoned between two sheets of this opaque paper. We now
        have to make it visible. </p>
      <p>A screen of zinc sulfide on cardboard is illumined by daylight
        and its surface applied against the strip of glass covered with
        black paper. The face next the phosphorescent screen is exposed
        for 10 seconds at a distance of 20 cm from a paraffin lamp. The
        whole affair is then carried into the dark room. On lifting up
        the phosphorescent screen there will be seen on its surface the
        image of the metallic cross which was enclosed between the two
        sheets of black paper. </p>
      <p>The above experiment is, moreover, the one I have recourse to
        in order to verify at once the transparency of the bodies, black
        paper, ebonite, etc., employed in my experiments, some samples
        of which turn out to be opaque by reason of the foreign bodies
        they contain. </p>
      <p>The zinc sulfide with green phosphorescence, being rarely met
        with in commerce, one can at a pinch replace it, in the case of
        the last described experiment only, by a screen of calcium
        sulfide; but it is indispensable that there should be an
        interval of at least 24 hours between the exposure of the screen
        to daylight and the time when the experiment is effected. If a
        screen recently insolated, and consequently very luminous, is
        used, no image is obtained on its surface. </p>
      <p>[Green-phosphorescent ZnS is caused by the presence of ~ 0.01%
        copper activator. -- Ed.] </p>
      <p>When these experiments were first published I gave away the
        little material enabling them to be repeated to all the learned
        men who asked me for them. A distinguished professor pf physics,
        Prof Izarn, wrote to me: "I hastened to effect the experiment
        with the material you were good enough to send me, and I was
        stupefied with the clearness of the results. I should never have
        believed it would be so evident and so rapid". It must be
        acknowledged, however, that the majority of physicists preferred
        to deny the exactness of my experiments rather than to repeat
        them. Others tried them with the aid of a photographer’s red
        lamp, which instantaneously extinguishes the phosphorescence of
        the zinc sulfide, and, naturally, observed nothing. </p>
      <p><b>2. Photography through Opaque Bodies</b> </p>
      <p>It has been explained above (Figure 31) how objects enclosed in
        opaque boxes may be photographed. We will now vary these
        experiments by photographing external objects, such as a house,
        through an opaque body. </p>
      <p>For the realization of the experiments which now follow,
        various objects can be used. The most convenient is Japan
        varnish, which is poured two or three millimeters thick on the
        movable diaphragm of the focusing tubes, for the back of which
        is substituted a thin plate of mica fixed to the sides by strong
        glue. When the varnish is dry it will be observed, by
        interposing it between the sun and the eye, that it appears
        absolutely opaque. The object is to be reproduced on the ground
        glass of the camera is focused, and the diaphragm is put in
        front of the focusing tube. It thus constitutes an opaque body
        placed between the light and the roughened glass. </p>
      <p>A screen of zinc sulfide is then illuminated by daylight, and
        placed in the usual dark slide of the camera as if it were an
        ordinary photographic plate. Then lifting in the ordinary way
        the shutter of the frame, it is left open before the object to
        be reproduced for a period varying with the light. </p>
      <p><b>Figure 33</b> </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="1fig33.jpg" height="314" width="285"></p>
      </center>
      <p>The photograph here given (Figure 33) is that of a house in
        daylight, and the objective used was a portrait lens. The
        exposure lasted one minute. </p>
      <p>The exposure at an end, the frame is closed and taken into the
        dark room, whence care has been taken to eliminate all
        (especially red) light. On opening the frame, we see on its
        surface the image of the object which was placed in front of the
        objective. In order to fix it, the phosphorescent screen is
        placed, while still in the dark, for 5 minutes against the
        surface of a gelatino-bromide plate, which is afterwards
        developed in the usual way. We have an image obtained by using
        the invisible rays of light. I give here (Figure 34) an image
        thus obtained. </p>
      <p>The want of clearness comes (1) from the focusing with great
        wavelengths only being possible by calculation; (2) from the
        phosphorescent screens used as sensitive plate having a rough
        surface. </p>
      <p>I said above that it was possible to employ very different
        substances as opaque bodies, but it must be remarked that with a
        ground glass no better image could be obtained than by placing a
        transparent ground glass before a focusing tube. Unpolished
        surfaces play, as is known, the part of diffusing screens. If we
        wish therefore to use as opaque body unpolished or badly
        polished matter, it is necessary to place it, not in front of
        the objective, but immediately in front of the phosphorescent
        screen -- that is to say, in contact with it. </p>
      <p>It is useless to try the preceding experiment with calcium
        sulfide. The body is so little sensitive to radiations of great
        wavelength that even with an hour’s exposure no image would be
        obtained. </p>
      <p>Some of the experiments just described -- that is, those where
        the object to be reproduced is enclosed in an opaque box
        interposed between the sulfide screen and the light source --
        succeed just as well with the light of a paraffin lamp or even
        of an ordinary candle, as with sunlight. This does not result
        only, as might be supposed, from the richness of artificial
        sources of light in infrared radiations. It is especially due to
        the fact that the brightness of the objects lighted by
        reflection, as is the case with all those examined in daylight,
        is immensely less than that of the source which lights them. An
        object brought very close to a candle has very little
        luminosity, but the flame of the candle itself is extremely
        luminous. </p>
      <p>Its radiancy is superior to that of a white wall lighted up by
        the sun at full noon in the month of August. This is shown by
        placing the candle against the wall, when the flame is brighter
        than this last. </p>
      <p>The fact that the brilliancy of a simple candle, or even of a
        modest match, should be ore intense than that of an object
        lighted by the sun having seemed inadmissible to many persons, I
        took some instantaneous photographs (Figure 35) of a candle
        enclosed in a lantern which almost entirely enveloped it, and at
        the top of which was a white cardboard lighted by the sun. When
        developed, we recognize that the image of the candle is more
        intense than that of the cardboard. </p>
      <p>This intensity of sources of light, notwithstanding their
        feeble illuminating power, may be shown likewise, by
        photographing instantaneously, and at night, a street lighted by
        gas lamps. None of the objects lighted up will appear in the
        photograph, but all the gas lamps will be reproduced. </p>
      <p>These observations allow us to understand the experiments which
        follow relating to instantaneous photography in the dark through
        opaque bodies. </p>

      <p><b>3. Instantaneous Photography in the Dark</b> </p>
      <p>The experiment about to be described allows us to photograph in
        1/30 second the image of a luminous source (a candle enclosed in
        an opaque box), then observer being himself in complete
        darkness. </p>
      <p>With a camera furnished with a wide focus-tube and a so-called
        instantaneous diaphragm, we focus in the proper position on the
        ground glass -- so as to have an image of about equal size to
        the original -- the flame of a candle or of a small paraffin
        lamp enclosed in a laboratory photographic lantern. The lantern
        is then closed with the opaque body chosen -- black glass,
        ebonite, or Japanese varnish -- fixed between two strips of
        glass. The observer is consequently in complete darkness. We
        then introduce into the dark slide of the camera a screen of
        zinc sulfide illumined by daylight, and we uncover the objective
        for the thirtieth of a second. On opening the slide in the dark
        there is seen on its surface the image of the source of light,
        which may be preserved by placing it against a photographic
        plate. The photograph represented here (Figure 37) was thus
        obtained. </p>
      <p>If the observer wishes to see the image form before his eyes,
        he has simply to use one of the transparent glass screens before
        mentioned, and open the back shutter of the dark slide to as to
        be able to observe what passes on the screen during exposure.
        The screen is transparent enough to show on its back the image
        formed on the front face. </p>
      <p>This experiment shows the astonishing sensitiveness of zinc
        sulfide with green phosphorescence to radiations of great
        wavelength, a sensitiveness approaching that of gelatino-bromide
        for visible light. </p>
      <p>Calcium sulfide does not allow this preceding experiment to be
        realized, nor do the sulfides of zinc with yellow or red
        phosphorescence. </p>

      <p><b>4. Transparency of Different Bodies to Infrared Radiations</b>
      </p>
      <p>The transparency of bodies to radiations of great wavelength is
        never complete for the same body. That which we observe with the
        visible spectrum is equally true with the invisible.
        Transparency is always selective for each substance. The bands
        of transparency always border on those of opacity. </p>
      <p>There would have been no great interest, and it would have
        taken an extremely long time, to determine the regions which
        were transparent for each body examined. The transparent region
        determinable for sulfides goes from the extremity of the visible
        spectrum -- i.e., 0.8 microns -- up to 3 microns or thereabouts.
      </p>
      <p>In a general way, it may be said that the infrared radiations
        are more penetrating than those of the visible spectrum.
        Although not by any means a constant law, it is noticed that
        transparency seems to diminish as the wavelength is reduced. It
        is known that light is less penetrating the farther it advances
        towards the ultraviolet. At the extremity of this region, all
        bodies, even a glass plate 1/10 mm thick, become opaque, and to
        waves of the length of 0.1 micron a stratum of air 1 cm is as
        opaque as lead. </p>
      <p>But, I repeat, there is nothing absolute in this law. The
        transparency also depends on the structure of the bodies
        traversed. There are some which are very opaque for great
        wavelengths. It is for this reason, for example, that the
        atmosphere absorbs all radiations above 5 microns, and this is
        the reason why these latter do not figure in the solar spectrum.
        The radiations of higher magnitude -- that is to say, from 5 to
        60 microns -- are only observed in flames, and most bodies have
        a rather low transparency with regard to them. The Hertzian
        waves, supposed to be analogous to light, on the contrary,
        easily traverse bodies which the great light waves do not
        penetrate. </p>
      <p>Bodies heated to a temperature not very high -- that is to say,
        under 100° C -- emit radiations hardly exceeding a length of 5
        to 6 microns. They have also but little penetration. Melloui in
        the course of his experiments observed the fact, which was quite
        inexplicable in his time, that transparent bodies, like glass or
        quartz, were opaque for the waves emitted by a body heated to
        100° C. </p>
      <p>It will be remembered that this opacity is utilized in
        greenhouses in which glass bell-shades shelter certain plants.
        The visible waves of light pass very freely through the glass
        and heat the bodies on the inside of it. The latter become at
        once sources of radiant heat; but owing to their length, the
        waves emitted are unable to escape through the glass. They are
        thus imprisoned, and the plants do not become chilled. </p>
      <p>Radiations of great wavelength only appear to act on
        phosphorescent screens up to 3 microns or thereabouts. Screens
        may indeed be impressed at a greater distance, i.e., up to and
        beyond 6 microns, but by a very different mode of action to that
        utilized up to the present. The rays then act only by their
        thermal properties, and that is why their action only manifests
        itself at the expiration of some 30 seconds. The effect produced
        may be observed by covering a part of the screen with a strip of
        glass -- opaque to these radiations -- so as to have a field for
        comparison. A screen of slightly luminous zinc sulfide exposed
        for 30 seconds to the radiations emitted by a body heated to 50°
        C becomes slightly impressed. The radiations here act, I repeat,
        by their thermal action, and not by the specific action on
        phosphorescence utilized in the previous experiments. </p>
      <p>My method of observation of the transparency of bodies by means
        of phosphorescence is very simple. On one half of the
        transparent zinc sulfide and glass screen is placed the body
        serving as unit of comparison -- for instance, a strip of
        chlorite 1 mm thick -- and on the other, the opaque body of
        which it is desired to ascertain the relative transparency. </p>
      <p>I then take up a position at a fixed distance from a paraffin
        lamp placed in a dark room, the screen of zinc sulfide having
        been isolated by exposure to daylight. Its surface is protected
        by a metal plate, and when I am at a suitable distance from the
        lamp -- 1 meter for example -- the half not covered by ebonite
        is uncovered, and the light allowed to act on it for a given
        time -- say, 5 seconds. Then covering up this part, and
        uncovering that over the opaque body of which it is desired to
        ascertain the transparency, we allow the rays of light to act
        until the intensity of the two surfaces is the same. If it takes
        20 seconds to obtain this identity, I conclude that the body
        under experiment is twice as transparent as the ebonite taken as
        standard. As phosphorescent sulfides receive cumulative
        impressions, the transparency becomes a function of the time. We
        must then take the time as its ratio -- which is what the method
        just indicated does. </p>
      <p><i>Table of Transparency of Various Opaque Bodies to Invisible
          Radiations Not Exceeding 8 Microns</i> </p>
      <p>Black Japanese Varnish: even at a thickness of 1 cm, is
        transparent to such a degree that the rays passing through it
        impress the phosphorescent screen in 2 seconds. Even when less
        than 1 cm thick, it produces the impression in 2 or 3 seconds. </p>
      <p>Pure Ebonite: nearly as transparent as varnish up to 1 cm </p>
      <p>Ebonite: half a mm thick, containing 1% lamp-black or metallic
        oxides; almost completely opaque. </p>
      <p>Black Paper: very transparent, but only half as much so as pure
        ebonite. </p>
      <p>Red Phosphorus in plates 1 mm thick: as transparent as ebonite.
      </p>
      <p>Wood, Stone, Marble, Grey Cardboard, Black Cloth: Transparent,
        but much less so than ebonite. </p>
      <p>Colored Glass: Very transparent, but red the least and orange
        the most so for the infrared. </p>
      <p>Bromine and Iodine: Still more transparent than ebonite. </p>
      <p>Fused Silver Chloride: cut into plates less than 1 mm thick;
        slightly less transparent than ebonite. </p>
      <p>Antimony, Lamp-Black, and Arsenic: very opaque. </p>
      <p>Ammoniacal Copper Sulfate, Potassium Bichromate (saturated
        solution), Water-Glass, and Alum (1 mm thick): transparent, but
        less so than ebonite. </p>
      <p>Iron sulfate (saturated solution, 1 cm thick): one-fourth as
        transparent as ebonite. </p>
      <p>The above shows that bodies formerly considered opaque for
        infrared radiation, such as alum, black paper, water glass,
        etc., possess, on the contrary, great transparency. </p>
      <p>When we wish to compare very rapidly the relative transparency
        of certain bodies, the following process may be employed: the
        substances to be examined are cut into bands and fixed on a
        glass plate, and then placed on a phosphorescent screen of
        brilliant zinc sulfide. They are exposed for 3 or 3 seconds in
        the dark to the radiations of a paraffin lamp. The darker the
        shade of the sulfur under these bands, the greater the
        transparency of the bodies. </p>
      <p>Of all the bodies enumerated above, the one found most opaque
        is lamp-black or the substances containing it. Black paper and
        ebonite which contain it -- and that is frequent -- at once
        become opaque. Before using them in experiments, it is therefore
        essential to examine their transparency, which only takes a few
        seconds. </p>
      <p>The opaqueness of lamp-black enables us to easily realize the
        following experiment, paradoxical at first sight though it is,
        viz., to reproduce, either by contact or by means of a
        photographic camera, a print placed in an envelope of black
        paper, and shut up in an ebonite box. He printing ink, which
        contains lamp-black, is not traversed, while its surrounding
        are, I have given in Figure 34 a photograph thus obtained. </p>
      <p>This opaqueness of lamp-black allows some of the rays to pass,
        but not the whole of them, since it arrests all those comprised
        between 0.6 and 3 microns. I have often repeated that throughout
        the visible, as well as the invisible spectrum, transparency is
        always selective -- that is to say, that an opaque body is, like
        a colored glass, only transparent for certain radiations. </p>
      <p><b>6. Use of the Invisible Rays for Rendering Visible Dark
          Bodies at a Great Distance</b> </p>
      <p>When I published for the first time some of the experiments
        related in this chapter, the Minister of Marine of that time
        asked me whether it would be possible to mask, with an opaque
        body, the man-of-war or of a lighthouse, in such a manner as to
        render them invisible to the enemy and yet visible to those of
        one’s own vessels which were furnished with suitable apparatus.
      </p>
      <p>The solution to the problem was simple enough, but it has lost
        all practical interest at the present time, since the progress
        of wireless telegraphy which enables distant vessels to
        communicate with one another, and I therefore think it can do no
        harm to publish details of my experiments. Generalizing the
        problem, I sought to discover whether a ship could not project
        into a harbor, a fortress, or a town, rays of light invisible to
        the besieged, but visible to the besiegers, thus allowing a
        precise aim to be taken at the enemy while keeping the gunners
        invisible. </p>
      <p>The following problem therefore was set for solution: To render
        visible without rendering it luminous any obscure body -- for
        instance, a vessel with its lights out in a dark roadstead. </p>
      <p>We must first consider that, when we project on to a dark body
        a pencil of visible light, this body is only rendered visible by
        the rays that it reflects. We know, on the other hand, that
        about 99% of the radiations projected by the best sources of
        light are quite invisible, and therefore unusable. So that, when
        we find the means of separating the visible from the invisible
        radiations, we shall only deprive our light of 1% of its total
        emission. The greater part of it will, consequently, still
        remain. </p>
      <p>The screens mentioned in the above possess this very property
        of eliminating the visible and allowing the invisible rays to
        pass. If a pencil of this invisible light is projected onto a
        dark body, this body will reflect it as it would ordinary light.
        It would therefore appear luminous to an eye capable of
        perceiving the invisible radiations reflected by it. Such an eye
        does not exist, but a phosphorescent zinc sulfide screen can
        take its place. </p>
      <p>Instead of the ground glass of a camera furnished with an
        objective of small focus capable of embracing a wide extent of
        the horizon, let us expose a screen of zinc sulfide previously
        rendered phosphorescent by means of a ribbon of magnesium r by
        the x-rays from a Crookes tube; there will then appear on its
        surface the image of the bodies in darkness, on which has been
        projected a pencil of invisible radiations. </p>
      <p>This invisible light will simply come from the reflection of
        that sent by the electric searchlight carried by all warships,
        the visible rays of which we shall have previously masked by
        means of an opaque plate. </p>
      <p>This plate must not be made of ebonite or black paper, as used
        in our preceding experiments, for the reason that they would be
        promptly destroyed by the heat. The only available body is black
        glass, of which there exist varieties opaque enough to blot out
        the disc of the sun when interposed between that orb and the
        eye. Not that all black glasses by a long way are transparent to
        invisible radiations, but there are some easily obtained in
        commerce. It is only necessary to ascertain their transparency
        by the means I have described. </p>
      <p>All the experiments set forth in this chapter are based on the
        use of bodies sensitive to radiations of great wavelength, but
        this sensitiveness is only very great for radiations hardly
        exceeding 3 microns. Now, those emitted by bodies at a
        relatively low temperature -- the human body, for example -- are
        of much greater wavelength, and do not impress phosphorescent
        matter. If we could discover a body sensitive to those
        radiations, nothing would be easier than to photograph a living
        body in the dark without any other source of light than the
        invisible light it is continuously emitting. </p>
      <p>Down to the absolute zero of temperature, all bodies
        incessantly radiate, as has been seen, waves of light invisible
        to our eyes, but probably perceptible by the animals called
        nocturnal and capable of finding their way in the dark. </p>
      <p>To them, the body of a living being, whose temperature is about
        37° C, ought to be surrounded by a luminous halo, which the want
        of sensitiveness of our eye alone prevents our discerning. There
        does not exist in nature, in reality, any dark bodies, but only
        imperfect eyes. All bodies whatever are a constant source of
        visible or invisible radiations which, whether of one kind or
        the other, are always radiations of light. </p>

        <b><font size="+1">The Part Played by the Various Luminous
            Radiations in the Phenomena of Life</font></b></center>
      <p><b>1. The Part of Light in the Phenomena of Life</b> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;As the invisible infrared rays form the greater part of
        the solar spectrum, it may be imagined that they play a
        considerable part in meteorology and in vegetable physiology.
        Their properties in this respect are very little known.
        Hitherto, their caloric actions which were long since observed,
        and their power of passing through a great number of opaque
        bodies as brought to light by my researches have alone been
        studied. </p>
      <p>It occurred to me to also study some of the physiological
        actions of the infrared rays -- that is to say, their influence
        on vegetable life, and to inquire especially whether they might
        not exercise some of those antagonistic effects established
        during the study of phosphorescence which will be studied in
        detail in the next chapter. For want of materials, I was unable
        to proceed very far in these researches. </p>
      <p>We know that visible light has two opposite actions on the life
        of vegetables -- the one oxidation or the respiratory function,
        the other reduction or the chlorophyllic function. </p>
      <p>The first of these may be accomplished in the dark. By its
        means the pant absorbs oxygen and exhales carbonic acid, as do
        animals. </p>
      <p>The chlorophyllian function, the converse of the above, on the
        contrary, can only take place in the light, and is due solely to
        absorption. Thanks to this, the plant decomposes carbonic acid
        and fixes the carbon in its tissues. The luminous energy stored
        up by the chlorophyll enables the protoplasm of the plant to
        transform mineral substances into those organic products,
        complicated and charged with energy, without which the life of
        the higher animals would be impossible. Vegetables thus
        establish a permanent link between the mineral and the animal
        world. Thanks to them, matter passes without ceasing through
        different forms of life rising progressively from the mineral to
        the higher animal. </p>
      <p>In this perpetual cycle, two elements of transformation,
        bacteria and chlorophyll, play a preponderant part. The bacteria
        bring back to the mineral state the products used by the
        functions of the higher lives, and the chlorophyll raises the
        mineral substances to the organized state. </p>
      <p>Bacteria are able to pursue their destructive action in
        complete darkness. Chlorophyll is obliged to absorb the luminous
        vibrations before playing its part. The vegetable world
        therefore represents a transformation of light. It is the
        luminiferous ether, absorbed and transformed by plants, which
        ripens our harvest and makes green out forests. Life represents
        one of its transformation. </p>
      <p>It cannot, however, be said that the very great energy stored
        up by the plant is entirely due to the very slight energy
        produced by the absorption of the luminous rays by the
        chlorophyll. The rays absorbed, no doubt, act by provoking
        liberations of intra-atomic energy, the mechanism is which is
        not comprehended. The vibrations of the ether probably release
        forces which thousands of ages have in times past accumulated
        within the atom. </p>
      <p>What effect have the various visible or invisible radiations on
        the life of vegetation? The part played by the first named has
        been studied by several generations of seekers. That of the
        second is largely unknown hitherto by reason of the
        insufficiency of the methods employed to determine its action. </p>
      <p><b>2. Methods of Observation of the Action of the Solar
          Spectrum on Plant Life</b> </p>
      <p>The value of experiments always depends on the choice of
        methods. Those employed to study the actions of the various
        parts of the solar spectrum, especially the infrared rays, on
        plant life are unfortunately marred by causes of error which
        take away all value from many of the results -- contradictory
        moreover as these are -- obtained up to the present time. It is
        easy to put these in evidence. </p>
      <p>To observe the properties of the various radiations it was
        natural to think of decomposing light by a prism, and of placing
        the plants under the various radiations thus separated. The
        decomposition of carbonic acid by the leaves, for instance, is
        measured by introducing them under the different pencils of
        light which the prism has separated. </p>
      <p>This method, so simple in appearance, gives rise to causes of
        considerable error. The first and most serious is that the
        light, when sufficiently dispersed to spread over a certain
        surface, loses its intensity to an enormous extent. Now, the
        influence of intensity in chemical reactions is, as has been
        shown, of capital importance. When operating with a prism one is
        inevitably led to seek in the color of the ray the cause of
        effects due, in reality, to differences of intensity. It has
        long been known that in the faint light of a room plants
        decompose very little or even no carbonic acid at all. Yet this
        light contains the rays necessary for its decomposition. The
        light fails to produce this only through lack of intensity. </p>
      <p>This first cause of error would of itself be sufficient to
        vitiate all the consequences drawn from the facts observed.
        Moreover, it is not the only one. Prisms, especially those made
        from flint, generally chosen on account of their great power of
        dispersion, absorb nearly all the ultraviolet rays, the action
        of which is very important, and a great part of the infrared. </p>
      <p>No doubt these two drawbacks can be theoretically remedied by
        using quartz or rock-salt prisms, which in fact has been done.
        But the dispersive power of these substances is very small, and
        their spectrum consequently is small in extent. </p>
      <p>The causes of the preceding errors, and of numbers more of
        which the complete details would be too technical to be given
        here, explain sufficiently the divergences in the results
        obtained by former observers. According to some, the
        decomposition of carbonic acid by the plant -- that is to say,
        its most important function -- is nil in the red, and
        considerable in the green. According to others, it is exactly
        the contrary -- the&nbsp; action is nil in the green, and at its
        maximum in the red. This last result is, however, the most
        probable, seeing that it is in the red and its neighborhood that
        are to be found the bands of absorption of the chlorophyll. To
        sum up, there is little exact information to be gained from the
        studies effected by the use of prisms. </p>
      <p>The results obtained by replacing the prism by colored glass
        are no better. This is a pity, for the process is practically
        very simple, since all that one has to do is cover over the
        greenhouses in which the experiments are conducted with panes of
        glass of different color. </p>
      <p>This method is the result of an error into which many
        experimenters have fallen. Because the eye sees but one color
        through a colored screen -- blue glass, for instance -- it is
        imagined that this screen only allows the one color perceptible
        by the retina to pass through. Now this is not the case at all.
        No glass, except the red, is monochromatic. All allow the whole
        of the spectrum to pass through. This is easily verified by
        holding colored glass between the sky and the slit of a small
        direct-vision spectroscope. I have had occasion to examine a
        considerable quantity of colored glasses, and have observed that
        all except the red allow the whole of the spectrum to pass, and
        only weaken the relative intensity of its various parts. </p>
      <p>By covering a greenhouse with colored glass, then, we do little
        but reduce unevenly the intensity of the various luminous rays.
        When a plant is placed under colored glass, it is almost the
        same as placing it in a badly-lit room. </p>
      <p>The use of colored glasses to separate the various radiations
        carries with it yet other sources of error. As they absorb the
        infrared rays very unequally, we may attribute to the influence
        of light what is due to that of heat. Between one glass and
        another, the differences of caloric action are considerable. By
        placing a thermometer in boxes with a capacity of about one
        cubic decimeter, each one covered by different colored glass and
        thus forming small glass-houses, I observed that the internal
        temperature, which in the sun was 30° C, went up to from 10° to
        15° in 10 minutes, according to the temperature of the glass. </p>
      <p>The only experiments realizable with colored glass are those
        made with red glass. This is, as has been said, almost
        monochromatic. </p>
      <p>The experiments effected in greenhouses covered with such glass
        at the observatory of Juvisy seem to prove that a certain number
        of plants receive in red light a much more considerable
        development than in ordinary light. Such, for instance, is the
        case with sensitive plants, lettuce, gladiolas, geraniums,
        begonias, potatoes, male ferns, etc.&nbsp; Some (beetroot,
        pansies, wallflowers, etc.) on the contrary, thrive less under
        it. </p>
      <p>Were we to admit as demonstrated that certain plants develop
        much better in red than in white light, the conclusion must
        naturally be adopted that, as in the case of phosphorescence,
        certain rays have a contrary effect to that of others. In white
        light, a plant evidently receives as many red rays as under a
        red glass, since this last simply eliminates from the light all
        the rays saving the red. If the fact of this elimination alone
        favors in large measure the development of the plant, it is
        because the eliminated rays act so as to weaken the action of
        the red. This would be exactly what is observed with regard to
        the photographic plate, as we shall see in the next chapter.
        This plate becomes much more luminous when we withdraw certain
        antagonistic rays from the light which strikes it. </p>
      <p>The antagonistic actions observed as regards phosphorescence
        thus exist also for plant life. Green has already observed that
        the violet and the ultraviolet rays tend to destroy the
        diastase, while its production increases under the influence of
        the red. It will be seen further on that, in experiments made by
        me, the infrared destroys the green matter in plants and other
        substances formed in the luminous part of the spectrum. </p>
      <p><b>3. New Method of Studying the Physiological Action of the
          Infrared, and Results Obtained</b> </p>
      <p>In the preceding researches, hardly anything but the visible
        rays of the spectrum have been dealt with. The only means known
        in former times of studying the infrared rays being separation
        by the prism, and as this collects the radiations of this end of
        the spectrum on a very restricted surface, we could scarcely
        determine their action. </p>
      <p>The fact, brought to light by my researches, of the very great
        transparency of black paper, ebonite, etc., to rays of great
        wavelength, enables them to be easily separated from visible
        light. A greenhouse is simply covered over with one of these
        substances -- for choice, the black paper. It is thus plunged in
        utter darkness, but bathed with invisible light. In reality, the
        greenhouse has only by this means been deprived of about a tenth
        of the total light (visible and invisible) which it would have
        received from the light of the sun. </p>
      <p>It probably need hardly be remarked, that there can be no
        comparison made between an enclosed place in which there only
        penetrate dark radiations of great wavelength and the cellars in
        which the action of darkness on plant life was studied. The
        darkness of the greenhouse is the same to the eye as that of the
        cellar, but the effects produced must necessarily be very
        different, since the greenhouse is bathed in the waves of an
        invisible light which the cellar does not contain. </p>
      <p>I have, unfortunately, not been able to pursue my experiments
        on this subject for a long time, the garden in which they were
        carried out only having been placed at my disposal for one
        season. They may, perhaps, render service to horticulturists by
        giving them the means of modifying the color of certain plants,
        and the taste of different fruits. </p>
      <p>It may be asserted in a general way that the infrared up to 2
        or 3 microns destroys the green matter formed under the action
        of light and also certain coloring matters, while it reduces the
        quantity of sugar, suppresses the sapid matter, and thus
        transforms the taste of different parts of the plants. </p>
      <p>Here is, however, the summary of my trials: --- </p>
      <p>(1) Seeds of various plants ~ Lettuces, cucumbers, grains,
        etc., set to germinate under glass bellglasses, covered with
        black paper, transparent to the infrared, all germinate quicker
        than by the light of the sun and then wither and die in abut a
        fortnight. </p>
      <p>(2) Plants developed in the light of day, and then exposed to
        the black light ~ The various plants behave very differently.
        Here are a few examples: Reine marguerite does not flower.
        Begonia withers in about 10 days. Strawberries are not modified,
        and ripened very well. Cucumbers and haricots die from the
        withering of their leaves. </p>
      <p>(3) Fruits and different parts of vegetables ~ Artichoke tops
        enveloped in black paper, transparent to long radiations, blanch
        completely in a few days, but develop better than their
        neighbors exposed to daylight, while gaining much in quality.
        Pears, peaches, and grapes blanch somewhat but develop very
        well. They were covered up as soon as they began to form. These
        three forms of fruit present the peculiarity that they lost a
        part of their sweet taste and their aroma. Tomatoes lose their
        red color, and become completely white. </p>
      <p>I repeat that I only give these experiments as general
        indications. In fact, they deserve the criticisms which could
        have been avoided had I been able to repeat them. The
        comparative method, indispensable for drawing conclusions from
        experiments in which several factors may operate, demands that
        there should be only one condition varying from one experiment
        to another, so as to be able to attribute differences in results
        to the difference of condition alone. Now, in these experiments,
        we have not always taken into account aeration, heat, etc. </p>
      <p>As the different parts of the light exercise, as we are about
        to see, strongly antagonistic actions, it would be very useful,
        both in the light baths now much used in medicine and in
        biological researches, to be able to separate the rays so as to
        study the part played by each of them. </p>
      <p>In the present state of science, the comparative studies which
        are possible on the action of the various rays of visible or
        invisible light, without seriously reducing their intensity, are
        limited to the use of the following screens: -- </p>
      <p>(1) Entirely without screen ~ The parts which act (the whole of
        the solar spectrum) range from 5 microns to 0.295 microns. </p>
      <p>(2) Screens formed of thick window glass ~ The greater part of
        the uv rays and the ir rays beginning at 2 microns are
        suppressed. </p>
      <p>(3) Screens formed of red glass ~ Complete suppression of all
        the uv and of all the visible spectrum as far as the red. The
        only rays which act are the red and the infrared as far as 2 or
        3 microns, according to the quality of the glass. </p>
      <p>(4) Screens formed of black paper or ebonite ~ Suppression of
        all the visible spectrum. The active rays are infrared. </p>
      <p>(5) Screen formed of a strip of metal ~ No ray traverses the
        metal, but it becomes heated, and emits from its underside
        radiations of 6 microns and beyond, according to its
        temperature. These radiations do not exist in the solar
        spectrum, but it would be of interest to ascertain their action,
        and discover whether it is simply caloric. </p>
      <p>Notwithstanding their insufficiency, these researches give us a
        presentiment of the great interest of the researches for which,
        through lack of a suitable laboratory and of sufficient means, I
        have only been able to sketch the way. </p>

        <b><font size="+1">The Antagonistic Properties of Certain
            Regions of the Spectrum</font></b></center>
      <p><b>1. Rays which Illuminate and Rays which Extinguish</b> </p>
      <p>The study of the infrared has led us to observe that it often
        exercises actions diametrically opposed to those of the other
        extremity of the spectrum, destroying, for instance, an action
        produced under the influence of this last. </p>
      <p>The discovery of these antagonistic actions of the two
        extremities of the spectrum is contemporaneous with the origin
        of photography; but we are compelled to imagine that the
        experiments effected to prove this phenomena were not
        sufficiently demonstrated since their interpretation has log
        been disputed, and was again challenged recently in a long
        discussion before the Societe de Physique. The slow actions of
        inversion following one another in photographic impressions
        seem, in fact, to lend themselves to various interpretations.
        The question, evidently, can only be entirely elucidated by
        finding means of rendering instantaneously evident these
        antagonistic actions. It is these instantaneous effects which
        are realized in the experiments which follow. </p>
      <p>The first observations on phosphorescence made it plain that
        all one end of the spectrum, comprising the blue, violet, and
        ultraviolet rays, illumine a phosphorescent screen taken out of
        the dark. The other end of the spectrum (the green, red and
        infrared rays) on the contrary, extinguish phosphorescence, and
        never produce it. Certain rays therefore act as illuminating and
        others as extinguishing rays. These two actions are plainly
        antagonistic but as they are very slow in the case of most
        phosphorescent bodies, they lend themselves to various
        explanations. To put them in evidence, we needed a body
        extremely sensitive to those radiations which extinguish
        phosphorescence. Zinc sulfide with green phosphorescence is the
        only body actually known to possess this property, and all my
        experiments have been made with screens coated with this sulfide
        in the manner described in a former chapter. </p>
      <p>If it is exact that certain rays produce phosphorescence, and
        that others acting in the opposite direction consequently
        extinguish it, it is evidence that by depriving the light of
        these extinguishing rays by the interposition of suitable
        screens, we may increase the brilliancy of the phosphorescence
        on a given screen. We shall see that this is really so, and
        that, for example, a body which does not become illuminated
        behind a glass trough of quinine sulfate, will become so if we
        keep back, by means of appropriate screens and without changing
        the position of the trough, certain rays from reaching its
        surface. </p>
      <p>E. Becquerel formerly pointed out that a screen of
        phosphorescent sulfide exposed to the light behind a trough of
        quinine sulfate, did not become illuminated, and he attributed
        this phenomenon to the absorption of the ultraviolet rays by the
        quinine sulfate -- rays which, according to him, "are the
        principal ones to excite phosphorescence". This explanation is
        wholly insufficient, for if the ultraviolet rays are able to
        excite phosphorescence, they are not by any means the ones that
        excite it most. Phosphorescent bodies are much better illumined
        by the blue and violet rays -- that is to say, by the part of
        the spectrum comprised between the lines G and H. This point
        must be borne in mind in order to understand thoroughly the
        experiments which follow. </p>
      <p>By varying the duration of the exposure of the phosphorescent
        screens we can easily take note of the sensitiveness of the
        sulfides in the various regions of the spectrum. With the
        projection spectroscope and the condenser above described
        (Figure 21), a screen of calcium or zinc sulfide is impressed in
        four seconds between G and H, and not at all in the ultraviolet.
        There must be an exposure of several minutes to obtain an
        impression in this last region. On the blue side the
        prolongation of the exposure extends the impression nearly up to
        the line F, but no farther. </p>
      <p>Let us now take a screen of zinc sulfide, a body so little
        sensitive to violet rays that it does not light up at all behind
        the trough of quinine sulfate. We will now compel it to be
        brightly lit up behind this trough by simply superposing on the
        latter another trough which does not arrest the blue rays, but
        does stop the extinguishing green, yellow, red and infrared
        rays. </p>
      <p>This experiment, and others of the same order showing
        distinctly the instantaneous action of the extinguishing and
        illuminating rays, are decisive. For lecture purposes they amy
        be thus simplified. </p>
      <p>We expose to sunlight (1) a screen of zinc sulfide, and (2) by
        the side of it another screen similar, but placed behind a
        flat-sided flask filled with a saturated solution of ammoniacal
        copper sulfate. This solution is almost opaque to the eye when
        in a stratum of about 2 cm. Leaving the flask in its screen, it
        is taken with the other into the dark, and then it will be
        observed, after withdrawing the flask of copper sulfate, that
        the sulfide screen placed behind this last, notwithstanding the
        apparent obstacle it presented to the passage of light, is much
        more luminous than the screen directly exposed. This difference
        is merely due to the fact that the copper sulfate has absorbed
        the extinguishing rays, and only allowed the illuminating ones
        to act. On the screen exposed directly to the sun the brightness
        of the phosphorescence is much less because a part of the effect
        of the illuminating rays has been destroyed by the extinguishing
        rays mingled with them. </p>
      <p>We may now return to the description of the experiment with the
        quinine sulfate trough, behind which we can light up or not at
        will a screen of phosphorescent sulfide. No experiment shows
        more strikingly the parts played by the extinguishing and by the
        illuminating rays. </p>
      <p>Behind a flat flask containing a perfectly clear 10% aqueous
        solution of quinine sulfate, acidified by sulfuric acid to the
        point of complete solution, we place a screen of zinc sulfide
        and expose the whole to the sun. Notwithstanding the complete
        transparency to the eye of the quinine sulfate, and however
        prolonged may be the exposure, we observed on taking the flask
        and screen back into the dark that the zinc sulfide exhibits no
        trace of phosphorescence. This absence of phosphorescence is due
        solely to the fact that as the quinine sulfate retains a part of
        the illuminating rays and allows all the extinguishing ones to
        pass, it is these last which prevail. </p>
      <p><b>Figure 38 / 39</b> </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="1fig3839.jpg" height="517" width="405"></p>
      </center>
      <p>To prove that this is really so, we will again expose to the
        sun our zinc sulfide screen, placed behind the trough of quinine
        sulfate; but in front of this latter we will again place the
        trough of ammoniacal copper sulfate. Then, taking the trough
        back into the dark, we observe that our sulfide screen is
        brilliantly illumined, although it has only received the light
        through an almost opaque liquid. </p>
      <p>The explanation is easy. The quinine sulfate held back, as I
        said, a part of the illuminating rays and allowed to pass all
        the extinguishing rays; accordingly, it prevented all
        phosphorescence. By placing in front of it a trough of copper
        sulfate we suppress the great majority of the extinguishing rays
        (red and infrared) and consequently the blue and violet
        illuminating rays are allowed to act. The sum of the power of
        the illuminating exceeding that of the extinguishing rays, the
        screen becomes phosphorescent. </p>
      <p>If we had replaced the copper sulfate trough by a blue glass
        placed in front of the quinine sulfate, we should still have had
        illumination, but weaker than with the copper sulfate, because
        the blue glass stops the extinguishing rays very insufficiently,
        especially those of the infrared region. </p>
      <p>What has just been said regarding the action of the
        extinguishing and illuminating rays on phosphorescent bodies
        allows us now to comprehend the part taken by the screens
        interposed between phosphorescent bodies and the sources of
        light. </p>
      <p>Light being a mixture of radiations capable of acting in
        contrary directions, and its composition differing greatly with
        the sources employed, or with the filtering screens interposed
        between the light and phosphorescent bodies, the explanation of
        the facts I am about to enumerate will be easily arrived at. </p>
      <p>(1) A screen of zinc sulfide is much more illuminated in the
        dark than in sunlight. </p>
      <p>(2) The same screen is more illuminated under a blue glass in
        the dark than in sunlight. </p>
      <p>(3) Behind a trough 2 cm from back to front, containing an
        ammoniacal solution of copper sulfate, the illumination of the
        screen is still more intense, but on this occasion it becomes
        brighter in the sun than in the shade. </p>
      <p>(4) Behind a trough of alum or of iron sulfate the illumination
        of phosphorescent bodies is reduced instead of being increased.
      </p>
      <p>(5) By the light of a paraffin lamp or of a candle the
        illumination of a screen of zinc sulfide is almost nil, and on
        presenting to these sources of light a screen insolated by
        daylight, it at once becomes extinguished. The same phenomenon
        is not observed with a screen of calcium sulfide. </p>
      <p>Here are a few figures giving the luminous intensity of a
        screen of zinc sulfide illumined under most of the conditions we
        have just examined. </p>
      <p>The brightness of the sulfide insolated by the sun without any
        screen interposed is about 0.002 B (1/5000 candle power), c.p.).
        Taking this intensity as our unit, we see in the following table
        the increase in brilliancy produced by the interposition of
        various screens between the source of light and the sulfide they
        show us, for example, that the brilliancy of the zinc sulfide
        behind a trough of copper sulfate is 14 times as great (3/100
        c.p.) as when it has been illumined in the sun without the
        interposition of any screen. </p>
      <p>Luminous intensity of a screen of zinc sulfide exposed in
        sunlight ~ Relative Intensity (RI) = 1 <br>
        Intensity of the same screen illumined in the shade ~ RI = 2 <br>
        Intensity of the same screen exposed in sunlight under a cobalt
        blue glass ~ RI = 7 <br>
        Intensity of the same screen exposed in the shade under a cobalt
        blue glass ~ RI = 9 <br>
        Intensity of the same screen exposed in sunlight behind 2 cm
        saturated ammoniacal copper sulfate solution in copper trough ~
        RI = 11 </p>
      <p>These differences are not observed with other sulfides by
        reason of their lower degree of sensitiveness to the
        extinguishing action of radiations of great wavelengths. In
        order to observe them, then a substance like zinc sulfide,
        sensitive at once to the extinguishing and illuminating rays,
        was necessary. Its brilliancy under the influence of light
        always represents the difference between the action of the
        first-named rays and that of the second. </p>
      <p>We see therefore that it is solely on the relation existing in
        a source of light between the various radiations of which it is
        composed that the illumination of a phosphorescent body depends.
        By varying the relation we vary the brilliancy. </p>
      <p>This explains the action of a cobalt blue glass screen. It
        weakens the extinguishing radiations, and consequently increases
        the illumination. Copper sulfate, which stops the extinguishing
        radiations in a much greater degree, likewise greatly increases
        the illumination. Iron sulfate and alum act but slightly
        because, although they stop a portion of the infrared, and also
        a part of the ultraviolet, which is an illuminant, they stop
        neither the red nor the green, which are extinguishers. </p>
      <p>As regards the illumination of zinc sulfide being greater in
        the dark than in the sun -- a very curious fact which has
        escaped all other observers -- the explanation is exactly the
        same. Diffused light is blue light reflected by the sky. From
        spectroscopic observations of already ancient date, it contains
        relatively many fewer red rays -- and probably also fewer
        infrared ones -- than the direct light of the sun.
        Notwithstanding, therefore, the higher luminous intensity of the
        sun, the sulfide will be more luminous in the shade. This
        explanation is really the correct one, for if we withdraw from
        the solar rays by our copper sulfate solutions which act as
        extinguishers, the illumination will at once become much more
        brilliant in the sun than in the shade by reason of the greater
        intensity of the illuminating rays. </p>
      <p>The same reasoning explains why zinc sulfide not only does not
        become illuminated in the light of a strong lamp, but goes out
        when exposed to it, if previously illuminated. In our artificial
        systems of lighting nine-tenths of the rays emitted are
        extinguishing infrared rays. The action of the illuminating rays
        is, then, destroyed by them. Even by interposing a thick trough
        of copper sulfate, only a very weak illumination is obtained
        because, in view of the predominance of the infrared rays, it is
        impossible to stop them in sufficient proportion. Moreover, the
        interposition of this trough much reduces the intensity of the
        illuminating rays. Now, the degree of phosphorescence of a
        sulfide is, within certain limits, in direct ratio to the
        intensity of the source of light which has illuminated it. With
        feeble sources of light, phosphorescent sulfides so not become
        saturated, whatever may be the duration of the exposure. </p>
      <p>All that I have just said regarding zinc sulfide is not
        applicable, I repeat, to other phosphorescent sulfides by reason
        of their slight sensitiveness to great radiations, especially to
        the infrared, and this is why a screen of calcium sulfide does
        not become appreciably brighter behind troughs which stop the
        extinguishing radiations. The action of these last is too slow
        to combat that of the illuminating radiations which already have
        had time to act. </p>
      <p>The eye is even more insensible to infrared radiations than the
        phosphorescent sulfides other than zinc. If the sensitiveness of
        the retina were as it is for this last body, the algebraic sum
        of the effects produced by radiations acting in contrary
        directions, it would suffice to interpose suitable screens
        between the eye and a landscape, for the apparent brightness of
        this landscape to increase in enormous proportions. It would
        then be perfectly unnecessary to use electricity to light our
        streets. </p>
      <p>Such different actions from the two extremities of the spectrum
        are not observed in the case of phosphorescence alone. They also
        exist in photography, as I shall proceed to show. </p>
      <p><b>2. The Opposite Properties of the Various Regions of the
          Spectrum and their Actions in Photography ~</b> </p>
      <p>If photographic plates had, to the destructive action of the
        infrared rays, a sensitiveness equal to that of zinc sulfide, it
        would be possible to greatly increase, as we have done for the
        latter, their rapidity of impression by placing in front of the
        camera screens which stop the extinguishing rays. </p>
      <p>But in this case, because the photographic plate, although very
        sensitive to the visible rays, is not so to the invisible, which
        are thus unable to act. It is easy, however, by bringing in the
        action of time, to show that the extinguishing rays can destroy
        the impression on the plate produced by the illuminating rays. </p>
      <p>Let us place in a photographic dark slide a plate of ebonite
        which may be 1 mm thick, but which it is better to reduce to ½
        mm, so as to obtain sharp outlines. On or under this plate, we
        will glue a cross cut out of a sheet of tin. Behind the ebonite
        plate I will introduce in the dark a gelatino-bromide plate of
        very fine grain, previously clouded by exposing it for 2 seconds
        to the light of a candle. I close the frame and expose it for
        one hour in sunlight. The infrared rays pass through the ebonite
        and destroy the cloud produced on the plate by the previous
        exposure. In the part protected by the metallic cross they will
        not have acted, and that is why, on developing the image, we
        shall find a reproduction of the metal cross on a very light
        ground. The ebonite plate may also be replaced by two or three
        superposed sheets of black paper. </p>
      <p><b>Figure 40</b> </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="1fig40.jpg" height="358" width="382"></p>
      </center>
      <p>There is no analogy between this experiment and the
        investigations we obtain by over-exposing a plate lighted by the
        blue or violet rays. The infrared rays which destroy a
        photographic impression, never produce one. This property is
        limited to the infrared, for the red rays can, with a
        sufficiently long exposure, impress a plate. If, in fact, we
        prolong the exposure under red glass, the plate becomes first
        clouded and afterwards automatically unclouded. But in this
        experiment the phenomena of inversion observed with all
        radiations, and constituting a very different order of
        phenomena, come into play. In the visible part of the spectrum,
        any radiation whatever destroys the impression produced by
        greatly prolonged exposure -- a fact easy to verify by the
        spectroscope. </p>
      <p>We will summarize in the following table the antagonistic
        properties of the two extremities of the spectrum. </p>
      <p><i>Table of the Antagonistic Action of the Two Ends of the
          Spectrum</i> </p>
      <p>Visible Region of Spectrum ~ Invisible Infrared Region </p>
      <p>A. Cannot pass through opaque bodies ~ A’. Passes through most
        bodies opaque to the eye, metals excepted. <br>
        B. Impresses photographic plates ~ B’. Destroys the impression
        produced on photographic plates <br>
        C. Produces phosphorescence ~ C’. Extinguishes phosphorescence <br>
        D. Produces the majority of reactions on which plant life
        depends ~ D’. Destroys a great number of reactions produced by
        visible light. Destroys especially the coloring matter of
        plants. <br>
        E. Energetically dissociates matter, especially throughout the
        ultraviolet extremity ~ E’. Has no dissociating action on
        matter. </p>
      <p>The reasons for these differences cannot yet be sought; if the
        "How" of things is sometimes accessible, their "Why" is not yet
        so. </p>

      <p><b>1. The Causes of Gravitation</b> </p>
      <p>The description of forces of unknown origin might really be
        applied to all those we have hitherto studied, since we are
        ignorant of their essence; but at least we know something of
        their characteristics and their mode of propagation. On the
        other hand there exist forces such as gravitation, affinity,
        molecular action, etc., of which we know almost nothing. For
        this reason they have been relegated to a special division of
        this book. </p>
      <p>All our knowledge relating to gravitation can be reduced to the
        following definition; bodies attract one another proportionally
        to their mass and in inverse ratio to the square of their
        distance from each other. Of the causes of this attraction, of
        the manner in which it is propagated, and of the speed of its
        propagation, we can say nothing. </p>
      <p>The discovery of the just-formulated law is, it will be
        remembered, due to Newton, and cost him long research. Gravity
        had been known a long time before, and Galileo had perfectly
        studied its laws. But how far did its actions extend, and did it
        pass beyond the limits of our atmosphere? Of that every one was
        completely ignorant. </p>
      <p>The genius-inspired glance of Newton saw that weight might
        extend to the different planets and be the cause of their
        movements in space. He devoted many years of his life to the
        verification of the exactness of this hypothesis. </p>
      <p>After having discovered the laws of gravitation, Newton vainly
        attempted to determine its cause. "The reason of the properties
        of weight", he said, "I have not yet been able to discover". Nor
        were his successors more successful. One gets clearer and
        clearer glimpses that weight is due to the relations between the
        ether and matter, connected doubtless by lines of force; but
        this is only a more or less vague hint which still escapes the
        teachings of experiment. It is possible that the gyratory
        movements of atoms are communicated to the ether, and through it
        to the different material bodies, thereby establishing an
        attraction between them. The reciprocal attraction of vortices
        has at the present day been demonstrated by many experiments.
        When the gyratory movement of the particle is transformed into
        movements of translation in space during the dissociation of
        matter, these particles no longer exercise any attractive action
        on each other, and consequently cease to be ponderable. This
        explanation was given by M. Armand Gauthier in a memoir
        referring to my researches. </p>
      <p>Gravitation displays this incomprehensible characteristic,
        which no other manifestation of energy possesses, of not being
        arrested by any obstacle. The most delicate researches have
        shown that no body exists which is opaque to attraction. </p>
      <p>Gravitation is a very small force, if we consider only the
        action of the masses we have at our disposal. But it is a force
        extremely great for considerable masses. Its power is apparent
        to us every day in the phenomenon of the tides. Under the
        influence of the combined motion of the sun and moon, the seas
        are raised an average height of 1 meter, which represented a
        weight of 1000 kg per surface meter. </p>
      <p>Physicists have been able to say nothing more on gravitation
        than what is said above. In an important memoir, of which I
        reproduce a few passages, Prof. Vernon Boys has shown perfectly
        how inexplicable it remains. "It seems to defy", he says, "all
        our attempts to abandon the inconceivable idea of action at a
        distance; for even when we might conceive another mode of
        action, it is entirely incomprehensible that gravitation should
        act at a distance without regard to the existence or nature of
        the bodies in its path, and, as it appears, instantaneously.
        Moreover, in the actual state of our knowledge, no other
        physical agent, even among those which depend upon the ether,
        has any influence over the direction or the extent of the notion
        of gravitation. The difficulties that we experience in creating
        a mechanical representation of the ether are considerable; but
        the mode of propagation of gravitation seems still further out
        of our reach" (<i>Actes du Congres de Physique</i> de 1900, t.
        iii, p. 306). </p>
      <p>The speed of the propagation of gravitation was estimated by
        LaPlace as being immensely higher than that of light. M.
        Poincare considers it as propagated with a velocity of the order
        of that of the light-vibration. </p>
      <p>We do not know how gravitation is propagated, but it seems to
        me that the law of the inverse square of the distance allows us
        to imagine gravitic waves having a form analogous to that of
        light, electric waves, etc. It is, in fact, only to forces which
        are propagated in this way that such a law is applicable. It is
        only a consequence of the geometrical properties of spherical
        bodies, and results simply from the fact that the surfaces of
        concentric spheres are proportional to the square of their
        radii. Place a candle in the center of a sphere of given radius,
        and each part of this sphere will receive a certain quantity of
        light. Double the radius of the sphere, and as the same quantity
        of light is spread over a surface four times greater than
        before, its intensity over the same extent of the sphere will be
        four times less; while with treble the radius, the intensity
        will be 9 times less, and so on. It would be the same if the
        source of light were replaced by a sonorous body. The intensity
        of sound per unit of surface would be, for the same reason,
        inversely as the square of the distance. This law of inverse
        squares simply signifies therefore that the intensity at a given
        distance is inversely proportional to the surface of the
        spherical wave propagated to that distance, which is
        geometrically evident. When a force decreases with the distance
        in accordance with this law, it is legitimate enough to imagine
        that it is propagated by spherical waves. This should be the
        case with gravity. </p>
      <p><b>2. The Consequences of Gravitation</b> </p>
      <p>The laws of gravitation simply express this experimental fact,
        that all bodies exercise a certain attraction upon one another.
        From this phenomenon, apparently simple, although inexplicable,
        results the course of the stars, and, according to some
        physicists, all the forces of the universe, including those
        which governed the formation of our solar system. </p>
      <p>It is, in fact, generally admitted that the central globe which
        was the origin of our own, must have been formed by the
        reciprocal attractions of the elements of the primal nebula. </p>
      <p>The maintenance of the heat of the sun, whence is derived the
        greater part of terrestrial forces, must be the result,
        according to Helmholtz, of the progressive contraction of the
        sun following on the attraction of his elements for each other
        and the loss of vis viva [kinetic energy] which the molecules
        experience when coming close to each other. </p>
      <p>It is likewise by gravitation combining its effects with those
        of inertia that the planets describe their orbits in space. A
        body launched in a straight line would continue its course I the
        same line by reason of its inertia, but if it be subjected at
        the same time to the action of a force which attracts it in a
        direction perpendicular to that of its course, its rectilinear
        trajectory is deflected and becomes a curve. Their inertia
        acting by itself would have compelled the planets when they
        detached themselves from the sun at the moment of their
        formation to continue their course in a straight line through
        space. On the other hand, had they not received this initial
        impulse, gravitation would have brought them together into one
        single mass. The result of these two antagonistic actions is the
        curve described by them round the sun, which can, according to
        the extent of the impulse received in the first instance, be a
        circle, an ellipse, parabola, or hyperbola. Certain comets alone
        seems to have a hyperbolic trajectory, for the planets follow
        ellipses which are almost circles. All the planets of course act
        upon one another, which is why Kepler’s laws are only
        approximately exact. </p>
      <p>Centrifugal force, so named, results from this double action of
        the original impulse combined with gravitation. The star
        represents the stone held by the cord whirled by the slinger.
        The impulse received by the stone represents that received by
        the star, and the cord which keeps back the stone corresponds to
        attraction. This attraction is the immaterial string which
        attracts the star without ceasing, and compels it to treads a
        circular path. If it ceased to act for a single instant, the
        planets would escape into space in a straight line by following
        the tangent to their trajectory, like the stone which the cord
        fails to hold during its rotation. </p>
      <p>Thus, then, the movement of the stars is the result of two
        causes: a permanent force (gravitation) which acts on them
        without ceasing, and an inertial impulse which has given to the
        star a certain velocity which it keeps by reason of the
        principle of inertia, whereby a body set in motion continues in
        motion. We are, then, thrown back on the mysterious property of
        inertia studied above, which is perhaps more incomprehensible
        than gravitation. </p>
      <p>Gravitation, which is the origin of the forces and of the
        movements of the stars, is also that of the phenomenon called
        weight. This last is only a particular case if universal
        attraction, i.e., of the attraction which bodies exercise upon
        each other. When we say that a body possesses a given weight, it
        means that it is attracted by the earth. We measure the
        magnitude of this attraction by inquiring the pressure which it
        exercises on another body, the scale-pan of a balance for
        instance, or by opposing to it an antagonistic force of known
        magnitude, such as the elasticity of a spring or the attraction
        of a magnet. </p>
      <p>We most often measure and utilize forces by putting them in
        opposition to weight. The greater part of our machines are
        constructed either to use weight or to strive against it.
        Industrial mechanics is in reality the art of utilizing weight
        and inertia. </p>
      <p>Gravitation, inertia, and solar heat represent the three
        fundamental power utilized by man. If these magnitudes had been
        different, civilization would have taken a different aspect. So
        far as solar heat is concerned, we see this clearly when we
        notice how different are the fauna and flora at the Pole and at
        the Equator. Extreme heat and extreme cold alike seem to imply
        savage or at least barbarian life. Below 0° C and above 50° C,
        no civilization can be born. </p>
      <p>We perhaps see less clearly the phenomena which differences of
        gravitation might generate. It is easy, however, to anticipate
        how different would be the conditions of our existence if weight
        were reduced or assimilated. At first sight, we seen to have no
        right to imagine its non-existence, since it is, like inertia,
        an irreducible property of matter incapable of modification, and
        following bodies through all their changes. But, if gravitation
        remains indestructible, its effects might be restricted or
        reduced to nothing. It has been calculated that it would suffice
        for the earth to turn 17 times as fast as it does now for the
        centrifugal forces to entirely annul the attraction of the
        earth’s mass on bodies at the Equator. They would then cease to
        have weight, and consequently would not fall back on the earth
        when left to themselves. Their weight therefore depends on the
        speed of rotation of our globe, which itself depends upon the
        impulse received in the first instance, when, under the
        influence of centrifugal force, it detached itself from the sun
        at the time of its formation. </p>
      <p>There are other causes possible by which attraction might be
        annulled. It will be remembered that when the waves of light
        fall upon a source, they exercise a certain pressure upon it. It
        has been calculated that for portions of matter of small density
        and finely divided, the attraction of the sun might not only be
        annulled but even changed into a repulsion, which may be the
        cause of the deformation of the heads of comets. Poynting has
        calculated that a sun a the temperature of our own, it had only
        32 km diameter, would repel, instead of attracting, all bodies
        less than 1 cm through. </p>
      <p>It would be useless to dwell longer on these considerations,
        which show us merely how numerous are the possibilities of
        things, and how much the existence of living beings and all the
        ideas which we form of the world are conditioned by external
        forces from which we cannot withdraw ourselves. This is a
        self-evident notion, but one which certain philosophers rather
        forget. </p>
      <p><b>3. Forces Dimly Seen</b> </p>
      <p>It is hardly to be imagined that the forces of nature are
        limited to the small number of those with which we are
        acquainted. If we are ignorant of them, it is because we have no
        reagents which disclose them. The discovery of appropriate
        reagents is the sole means of putting them in evidence. During
        the last 20 years, science has annexed the Hertzian waves, the
        x-rays, the cathode rays, the radioactive rays, and intra-atomic
        energy to the small kingdom of the forces known of old. It is
        difficult to believe that the end of these discoveries is
        reached, and mighty forces may surround us without our knowing
        it. Electricity, unknown for thousands of years, would perhaps
        still remain so if all bodies were good conductors. </p>
      <p>This is no pace evidently for a dissertation on things of which
        we are ignorant. One ought first to try to discover them. A few
        hints hardly allow us to suspect their existence. </p>
      <p>Our means of research are generally the verification of
        attractions and repulsions, and do not take us very far. Several
        times, however, the attractions and repulsion which a light
        needle suspended by a thread of raw silk experiences when
        approached by a living body has been pointed out; but they are
        perhaps due merely to the action of heat. (1). </p>
      <p>[(1) Mr Legge tells me that he has established the fact that
        those actions do not manifest themselves through a vacuum. I
        made some experiments with this some years ago, and gave in an
        article in a popular magazine, <i>Pall Mall Magazine</i>, April
        1902, a description of an apparatus which I believe to be very
        much more sensitive than that referred to in the text. Recently,
        however, it occurred to me to surround the apparatus with what
        is known as a vacuum jacket, to invert over it a double bell
        glass, having a vacuum between its outer and inner walls. With
        this, the needle remains motionless, no matter what bodies are
        brought near to the outer cover of the apparatus. As a vacuum
        cuts off not only electrical influences but also heat rays, it
        seems most probable that the motion of the needle is, in the
        cases originally quoted, the result of convection current formed
        by heat in the interior of the receptacle. -- Ed.] </p>
      <p>We are, then, here entirely within the domain of pure
        hypothesis, and we ought not to stay there long. Let us merely
        say that intra-atomic energies are a source of many possible
        varieties of energy. Mr Georges Delbruck, an engineer, has
        suggested that the larger birds, whose soaring flight without
        apparent motion is so difficult to explain, may have the faculty
        of generating at the expense of intra-atomic energy a force
        capable of striving against gravitation until it renders it
        null. This hypothesis is very difficult to verify, but it is not
        fundamentally absurd. Gravitation is only an attraction, which
        can be annihilated by a corresponding repulsion, as that
        exercised on masses of iron can be annulled by a magnet. </p>
      <p>This theory will delight the spiritualist, who believe that
        they have verified the levitation phenomena which objects in
        relation with certain persons seem to present. Nevertheless,
        before explaining these levitations, their reality must first be
        rendered beyond dispute. </p>
      <p>As to the so-called psychic forces, materializations, etc., it
        will be useless to busy ourselves with them here. They have
        attracted attention of eminent scholars, such as Crookes, Lodge,
        Richet, and others, but they have yet to be demonstrated, and
        until this is done, it is better to try to interpret the
        phenomena observed by known causes. I had occasion to examine
        without prejudice, and with the assistance of M. Dastre, a
        subject, with a European reputation, but our investigations,
        continued throughout several séances, disclosed to us nothing
        demonstrative. The story of the N-rays, moreover, shows us the
        difficulty of thorough observations in similar matters, and of
        avoiding causes of error. Before building a temple to unknown
        forces, we ought to be perfectly certain that they do not issue
        wholly from that domain of illusion in which all divinities have
        hitherto been born. </p>

      <p><b>1. The Attractions and Repulsions of the Elements of Matter</b>
      </p>
      <p>Several chapters of <i>The Evolution of Matter</i> were
        devoted to the study of the equilibria of the elements of
        matter, and the forces of which they are the seat. We will run
        through them again to show how... </p>
      <p>[ Pages 353-354 Missing ] </p>
      <p>action is apparent. We call lines of force the directions in
        which the attractive and repellent effects are produced. While
        very easy to observe in electrical phenomena, the molecular
        fields of force due to other actions, may be made equally
        evident by different artifices, as shown in The Evolution of
        Matter. </p>
      <p>The most important of the molecular forces is that called
        cohesion. The existence of the bodies of which the universe is
        formed is due to its influence. It conditions their forms.
        Without its action the word would vanish in an invisible dust of
        ether. </p>
      <p>Although cohesion is an extremely powerful force, as is proved
        by the huge mechanical effort necessary to separate the
        particles of bodies, we possess in heat the means of annulling
        it. </p>
      <p>As soon as the molecules are sufficiently separated by heat,
        the most rigid body loses its consistence and becomes liquid or
        gaseous. The very fact that there is no cohesion as soon as the
        molecules are apart from each other, proves that the molecular
        attractions which produce cohesion only act at a very small
        distance. Bodies in powder, even when strongly compressed, do
        not become hard for this reason. However near to each other
        these particles may be brought by pressure, they are still not
        enough to attract one another. To bring them near enough for
        this purpose demands an enormous pressure. Spring was thus able
        to form blocks of brass by energetically compressing powdered
        copper mixed with powdered tin. </p>
      <p>Simple cooling produces the same effect, which is why, when we
        allow a melted body to cool, it returns to the solid state.
        Temperature constitutes one of those specially appropriate
        reagents of which we have so often taken occasion to show the
        importance. To separate the molecules kept together by cohesion
        demands an enormous effort, while only a relatively feeble one
        is necessary to separate them by heat. </p>
      <p>Nothing resists the molecular forces. We can split a bombshell
        full of water by freezing it. We have only to touch a body for
        its molecules to separate a little. </p>
      <p>Cohesion, which is already much reduced in liquefied bodies,
        disappears altogether in gaseous ones. Far from attracting each
        other, the molecules of gases behave -- at least in appearance
        -- as if they repelled each other. Thus, the smallest quantity
        of gas, introduced into a receiver, spreads into all parts of
        it. To compress a gas -- to force its molecules to draw together
        -- a considerable pressure must be exercised upon it.’ </p>
      <p>In solution, the molecules of the dissolved bodies behave in a
        similar way. They exercise upon the walls of the vessel
        containing them a pressure called osmotic, which is easily
        measured. The solution of a body has for this reason been
        compared to a gas. </p>
      <p>In the energy of cohesion we have therefore a force which is
        very great, but which has the characteristic of only acting upon
        the particles of bodies when they are a very small distance
        apart. This peculiarity is not found in the attractions which
        constitute gravitation. This acts on all bodies at all
        distances. </p>
      <p>We can form a summary idea of the forces which may produce
        cohesion by creating something similar in a body -- that is to
        say, a force capable of generating attraction. If we cause an
        electric current to circulate in a metal wire surround an iron
        rod, we give to the molecules of the rod a power of attraction
        sufficient for them to exercise upon a piece of steel an
        attraction which may rise as high as 100 kg/sq cm. In the field
        of force surrounding the metal, a considerable attraction may
        also be exercised. One thus has a glimpse of the way in which
        the ether can assume a form making it capable of exercising
        extremely energetic attractions. </p>
      <p>It has just been said that molecular attraction and repulsions
        are only manifest at a slight distance. There are, however, some
        which act from fairly far off. A piece of charcoal cooled to
        -200° C will so energetically absorb the air of the receptacle
        in which it is placed as to make a vacuum in it. A hydrometric
        body acts in the same way in respect of the water vapor
        surrounding it. Tantalum, heated to 600° C in an atmosphere of
        hydrogen, absorbs 600 times its volume of the gas in which it is
        plunged. </p>
      <p><b>2. The Molecular Equilibria</b> </p>
      <p>All the attraction and repulsions just spoken of are in
        equilibrium with each other, and also with the external forces
        surrounding them. Matter, which was formerly conceived to be
        independent of its surrounding medium, represents only a state
        of equilibrium between the external forces of which it is the
        seat and the external forces which envelop it. The most rigid
        body is transformed into vapor as soon as this medium is
        sufficiently changed. In fact, we cannot define any property of
        a body -- inertia excepted -- without mentioning the conditions
        of the medium in which it is plunged. Even when we do not see
        their variation, the properties of a body follow the least
        changes of its medium to put themselves in equilibrium with it.
        It suffices to bring the hand near matter for its equilibria to
        be modified. A variation of one-millionth of a degree in the
        medium in which it is plunged varies the electrical resistance
        of a body in a way detectable by our instruments. The bolometer
        is based on this principle. </p>
      <p>If we wish to point out the physical properties of any
        substance -- water, for instance -- we must always for
        completeness give the conditions of the medium. Two different
        saline solutions with the same osmotic pressure have the same
        freezing point; while the vapor-pressures of liquids are equal
        at temperatures equally removed from their boiling point, and
        bodies of the same atomic weight possess the same caloric
        capacity, etc. </p>
      <p>Van der Waals has gone further still in his law of
        corresponding states, which shows that if the volume, pressure
        and temperature are estimated by taking as units the initial
        quantities, one equation is enough to translate the properties
        of all fluids. This means that all have the same properties in
        corresponding states (1). </p>
      <p>[(1) The generality of the law of corresponding states is here
        rather exaggerated. It seems to be true for certain derivatives
        of benzene only. See Poincare, <i>The Evolution of Modern
          Physics</i>, p. 113) </p>
      <p><b>3. The Force and the Form</b> </p>
      <p>By molecular attractions and repulsions we can go very neat to
        an explanation of certain phenomena, but our ignorance in regard
        to the causes which give matter its form is complete. Why, for
        instance, do liquids when solidifying take certain regular
        geometrical forms which are invariable for each body? The hidden
        causes of the form of a crystal are as unknown to us as those of
        a plant or an animal. These things happen as if physico-chemical
        phenomena were governed by unknown forces, which compel them to
        act in a predetermined direction. </p>
      <p>We may, however, in some sort comprehend the genesis of a few
        forms by reducing them to extremely simple cases -- for
        instance, the molecular attractions within a liquid. When we
        introduce into an aqueous solution a drop of liquid of different
        osmotic pressure, the molecules of the two liquids are attracted
        or repelled, and sometimes form fairly regular figures. We may
        also, by combining attractions and repulsions of electrical
        origin, obtain greatly varied figures. Some have been given in <i>The






          Evolution of Matter</i>, which were formed by combining the
        attractions and repulsions of the particles of dissociated
        matter. </p>
      <p>By similar means we may obtain figures imitating plants. For
        the last 20 years certain observers, like Traube, have exercised
        their ingenuity in creating such reproductions. Of these, M.
        Stephane Leduc has obtained the most curious results, as may be
        judged by the figures given here. The mode of production
        indicated by him is very simple: "A granule of copper sulfate 1
        mm to 2 mm diameter, composed of two parts saccharose, 1 of
        copper sulfate, and water to cause it to granulate, is planted
        in an aqueous solution containing 2% to 4% of potassium
        ferricyanide, 1% to 10% sodium chloride and other salts, and 1%
        to 4% of gelatine. It germinates in a space of time which varies
        from a few hours to a few days according to the temperature. The
        granule surrounds itself with a membrane of copper ferricyanide
        permeable to water and certain ions, but impermeable to the
        sugar enclosed within it, which produces in this artificial seed
        the strong osmotic pressure which determines its absorption and
        growth. If the liquid is spread over a glass plate, the growth
        takes place on the horizontal place; if the culture is made in a
        deep basin, it takes place at once horizontally and vertically.
        One single artificial seed may give 15 to 20 stalks sometimes as
        high as 25 cm". </p>

      <p>We may think we see here the image of life, but there is hardly
        any more connection between these artificial plants and real
        ones than there is between a living man and his statue. Their
        production merely shows that osmotic equilibria may condition
        certain external forms. </p>
      <p>We have studied in this chapter only the relatively simple
        forces -- primary forces, we might say -- that govern the
        mineral world. They are, however, very obscure. When we come to
        the forces which direct the phenomena of life, the obscurity
        becomes greater yet. </p>

        <b><font size="+1">The Forces Manifested by Living Beings</font></b></center>
      <p><b>1. Living Matter and Cellular Life</b> </p>
      <p>We observe among living beings very distinct manifestations of
        energy: (1) physico-chemical forces, such as heat, light,
        electricity, described in physics; and (2) those united under
        the name of vital forces, of the nature and mode of action of
        which we are profoundly ignorant. For the sake of completeness I
        am obliged to speak of these last, but I do so with the
        certainty that I can say nothing useful on the subject. To
        descant on the phenomena of life while we are incapable of
        explaining why the stone which leaves the hand falls to the
        ground is a task which must be left to the leisure of
        metaphysicians. </p>
      <p>The sole interest which this chapter may possess lies in its
        showing exactly the present limits of our slight acquaintance
        with those still very incomprehensible phenomena, the synthesis
        of which constitutes life. All living beings without exception
        are composed of an aggregate of little microscopic elements
        called cells. These, although if such an extreme minuteness that
        their diameter hardly exceeds some thousandths of a millimeter,
        have yet an extremely complicated structure, and properties even
        more so. </p>
      <p>In a very summary way we may say that they are composed of a
        granulous substance called protoplasm, containing in its midst a
        nucleus of filaments. The microscope has shown the structure of
        this dust of life, but the marvelous part is that which we do
        not see, It contains, in fact, the germ of ancestral forms and
        those which will be born in the future course of its evolution.
        Every living being is derived from one primitive cell -- the
        ovum, the transformations of which suffice to form a complete
        being in a very short space of time. </p>
      <p>These cells, then, constitute the materials from which living
        beings are built. The lowest of these beings are composed of a
        single cell. They multiply, stick together, and are associated
        with the higher ones to form their different organs. The higher
        being is therefore a veritable society of cells having each its
        destined function, but working together in the general interest.
        The higher animal possesses a nervous system which puts the
        organs formed by the cells, and the digestive and circulatory
        apparatus which brings to them the elements of nourishment, in
        relation with one another, while the other organs are charged
        with the expulsion from the system of the remains of their
        nourishment, and so on. The whole living being labors to
        maintain the cells; they depend on it, and it on them. </p>
      <p>The protoplasm of which the cells are composed represents the
        stock of life common to all living things, from the most humble
        to the highest. It fulfills universal functions, assimilation as
        well as destruction, and, from the chemical, anatomical, and
        physiological standpoints, seems to be little modified from one
        being to another, while its forms change to an infinite extent.
        Nature, which economizes her efforts, has need of little in
        order to vary the elementary structure of beings. </p>
      <p>It is by the study of the life of cells that we may best
        understand the profundity of the mystery of life and its amazing
        complexity. To show this it will be enough to recall what
        appears on this subject in <i>The Evolution of Matter</i>. </p>
      <p>The chemical studies which humble cells know how to manufacture
        comprise not only the most skillful operations of our
        laboratories, such as etherification, oxidation, reduction,
        polymerization, and so on, but many others demanding still more
        skill which we cannot imitate. By means which we do not even
        suspect, the vital cells construct their complicated and varied
        compounds -- the albuminoids, cellulose, fats, starch, etc.,
        necessary to the support of life. They are able to decompose the
        most stable bodies, such as sodium chloride, to extract the
        nitrogen from the ammoniacal salts, and the phosphorus from the
        phosphates, etc. </p>
      <p>All these labors, so exact and so admirably adopted towards one
        end, are directed by forces of which we have no idea, and which
        behave exactly as if they possessed a second sigh far superior
        to our reason. That which they are accomplishing every instant
        of our existence soars far above all that the most advanced
        science can realize. The scholar capable of solving by his
        intelligence the problems solved every moment by the cells of
        the lowest creature would be so much higher than other men that
        he might be considered by them as a god. </p>
      <p>Although protoplasm is the seat of an incessant activity, it is
        only slowly renewed in each being, and does not in fact
        contribute to its support out of its own substance, but by the
        materials it incorporates. It hardly uses itself up more than an
        engine fed by coal. </p>
      <p><b>2. Instability is the Condition of Life -- Part Played by
          the Intra-Atomic Energies</b> </p>
      <p>Life is only maintained by an incessant using up of the
        materials borrowed from outside. The cell assimilates and
        destroys without pause. Instability is the law of life. As soon
        as it is succeeded by stability there comes death. </p>
      <p>Life is, then, the result of a constant exchange between the
        living being and the medium in which it is plunged, A being
        cannot be isolated from this medium, and would even be
        incomprehensible without it. It is the differential action of
        assimilation and destruction which governs the ascending or
        descending evolution of beings throughout their existence. Te
        cell dies without ceasing, but as it is renewed without ceasing,
        the living being has an apparent stability. It resembles a
        building the stones of which are every day removed by cunning
        demons, but are immediately replaced by other demons. The
        building does not change its appearance, and only begins to grow
        old when the restoring demons incompletely perform their task.
        The day when they no longer fulfill it, the building falls in
        ruins. </p>
      <p>The maintenance of life represents a great expenditure of the
        energy furnished by food. With a great number of animals this
        last is constituted of vegetables, which by themselves can raise
        mineral matter to the degree of complexity necessary for the
        creation of chemical compounds charged with a slight volume of
        unstable energy. Thanks to them, matter is unceasingly raised
        from the unorganized state, to return at length to the
        starting-point. </p>
      <p>But if the instability of the chemical elements of the cells is
        the very condition of life, does not the instability of the atom
        also play a part in these phenomena? I would not seem to
        exaggerate the influence of that intra-atomic energy which I
        have already made use of to explain many phenomena, but one must
        believe that its possible part in vital action is often present
        to the mind, for I have received letters from many doctors on
        this subject. I should not, however, have spoken of this, if
        experimental facts did not seem to demonstrate that the
        dissociation of matter may be manifested within the organism.
        Thus, for instance, Prof. Dufour has recently shown that air
        that has been breathed contains radioactive particles. Now these
        particles result, it will be remembered, from the dissociation
        of matter. I am also led to believe -- and M. Dastre, to whom I
        have submitted my hypotheses, entirely admits the fact -- that
        we must seek in atomic dissociations for the origin of the
        increase of energy produced by certain excitants, such as cola,
        caffeine, etc., whose composition clearly shows that they cannot
        be considered as foods. Some diastasic actions may well have a
        similar origin. The elements of protoplasm are considered at the
        present day as very unstable colloidal substances, and I have
        shown that these substances often come from the dissociation of
        matter. Given the colossal energy of intra-atomic energy. We can
        understand that the cell may become a mighty generator of energy
        without its composition being perceptibly altered [Biological
        transmutation. -- Ed.]. It must also be remarked that
        physiologists have never succeeded in furnishing an acceptable
        theory of the action of the excitants spoken of above. I hope
        that what has been said will permit them to give some
        explanation of these phenomena. These intra-atomic energies, set
        free within the organism, seem, moreover, of rather exceptional
        occurrence, and only intervene under the influence of certain
        excitants, when the living being is obliges to make a
        considerable effort rapidly. In normal conditions the forces
        which it manifests have especially as their origin the chemical
        energies which come from foods. </p>
      <p>These last may be very varied, but may be reduced, it will be
        remembered, into three categories: </p>
      <p>(1) Albuminoids (egg white, animal flesh, etc.) <br>
        (2) Carbohydrates (starch, sugar, etc) <br>
        (3) Fats </p>
      <p>We must add to these the oxygen of the air absorbed by
        respiration and necessary to displace, by combining with them,
        the energies of the chemical compounds introduced into the
        organism. </p>
      <p>The food value of alimentary substances is sometimes estimated
        by burning them in a calorimeter and measuring the calories they
        produced. This rather barbarous process would lead us to
        consider coal and petroleum as valuable foods, as they disengage
        by their combustion many calories. One kilogram of coal
        generates about 8000 calories, while the adult uses only about
        2500 a day. Prof. Chauveau has said: "We must give up looking
        for the nutritive value of food in their heat of combustion. The
        theory of food and alimentation cannot be presented under so
        simple a form". </p>
      <p>All foods produce heat, but this being the last term of the
        energetic changes of the organism, and not the first, it is
        evident that it is not this which generates the vital forces.
        Its part seems to be merely to put the elements of the organism
        in the conditions necessary for their proper working. M. Dastre
        made this point evident some time ago. </p>
      <p>When all the foods have given up their energy to the organism,
        they are cast forth under different forms, such as water,
        carbonic acid, urea, etc., deprived of usable energy. </p>
      <p>To sum up, we see that the vital forces are maintained by the
        chemical forces derived from the food, and that it is these last
        which uphold the first. </p>
      <p><b>3. The Forces Which Regulate the Organism</b> </p>
      <p>Even when we liken to physico-chemical forces the vital forces
        manifested by living beings, it must be recognized that some
        things happen as if there existed quite peculiar forces, some of
        which are intended to regulate the functions of the organs, and
        others to direct their forces. They must be described, for the
        sake of clearness, by a name, although they probably are only a
        synthesis of actions which are very different and not yet
        dissociated. We will call the first category regulating and the
        second morphogenic (i.e, generators of forms) forces. </p>
      <p>In spite of the efforts of thousands of workers, physiology has
        been able to tell us nothing of the nature of those forces. They
        have no analogy with those which are studied in physics. </p>
      <p>The regulating forces act as if they watched over the proper
        working of the living machine, regulating the temperature and
        the constancy of the composition of the blood and other
        secretions, limiting the oscillation of the different functions,
        adapting the organism to the changes of the outer world, etc.
        They hold undivided sway over that region of unconscious life
        which constitutes the greatly preponderant part of the existence
        of beings. The philosopher may deny their existence, but the
        physiologist, who sees them perpetually in action, hardly
        contests it. He generally recognizes, like Claude Bernard, true
        "directing principles which direct phenomena which they do not
        produce and physical agents producing phenomena which they do
        not direct". </p>
      <p>These real or apparent directive actions formerly caused us to
        admit the existence of immaterial agents, the soul or vital
        principle, independent of the body and capable of surviving it.
        In reality it is not one single directive soul that we should
        have to imagine, but many souls, for the life of an individual
        appears to us as the sum of small cellular lives almost infinite
        in number, and all fulfilling very different functions. Thanks
        to these directive forces, nature shuts up each organ in the
        sphere designed by her, and constantly brings them back to it
        with the two great springs of all the activity of beings --
        pleasure and pain. </p>
      <p>The regulating forces present the peculiar characteristics of
        being conditioned by a long ancestral past and of modifying it
        in every generation. The most modest cell, an amoeba or a
        globule of protoplasm, is charged with a past. To this must be
        attributed the variety of the reactions of living beings under
        the influence of external agents. In any vital act, and
        psychical manifestations must be included among them, our
        ancestors act as well as ourselves, but as their number is
        immense, there exists in every being the possibilities of action
        dependent on excitants capable of calling them forth. Many
        ancestors speak in us, but according to external circumstances
        they are not all equally heard. It is exactly this enormous past
        with which the least cell is saturated which makes so illusory
        our attempts to create living matter. "To create living
        matter!", writes M. Gustave Bonnier. "How can it be hoped for in
        an instant in the present state of science, when we think of how
        many accumulated characteristics, how much heredity, how much
        complicated future, there are in a fragment of living
        protoplasm? If we think that the development of a higher animal,
        its successive transformation in the embryo into a protozoan,
        into a worm, into a fish with gills, finally producing a mammal,
        a man -- and that all these future forms are found potentially
        in a microscopic fragment of inchoate living substance! If we
        reflect that this reminiscence of distant ancestors, this
        heredity acquired during tens of thousands of centuries all
        exist in this minute drop of protoplasm, we then understand the
        meaning of the truth, that it is not more difficult to create
        afresh a living animal -- an elephant for instance -- than to
        create a speck of living matter. When man shall solve this last
        problem, he will have become more creative than the Creator,
        stronger than all Nature, mightier than the Universe itself!" </p>
      <p><b>4. The Morphogenic Forces</b> </p>
      <p>The acquisition of a specific form belongs as well to minerals
        as to living beings, since mineral can assume the geometric
        contours characteristic of each. We have already studied their
        genesis when speaking in <i>The Evolution of Matter</i> of the
        life of crystals. </p>
      <p>But these substances of the mineral world only represent a very
        low order of life, fixed to some extent in invariability of
        form, and there is only a distant analogy between the life of an
        animal which constantly assimilates and destroys, and the
        immobility of a crystal. It does not represent a living form of
        matter, but only the ultimate term of life. </p>
      <p>The medium supplies to the living being the matter of which it
        is composed, the energies which it expends, and the excitants
        which put it into play. All these external conditions may modify
        its form, but they act on a basis of life that they cannot
        create. Until now only life has been able to create life. That
        it may have been born spontaneously at the dawn of the
        geological ages under the influence of unknown reactions is very
        probable, for it must needs be that life has a beginning, but we
        cannot say why it began, and we do not know how to make it begin
        again. </p>
      <p>The living being alone, then, enjoys the property of generating
        a substance analogous to its own and possessing the same forms.
        Every cell, and even every organ, possesses the mysterious power
        of creating forms similar to itself. Among the lower animals.
        Very part of the animal when but in pieces reproduces the
        wounded part. Among animals of fairly high organization, such as
        the tritons and the salamanders, a limb cut off, an eye torn
        out, is soon reborn. </p>
      <p>By going back to the real origin of each living being -- i.e.,
        to the cell from which it is derived -- we see better the
        inexplicable side of these morphogenic forces. This primal cell
        will undergo, tanks to them, the series of transformation which
        lead it to form a tree, a bird, a whale, or a man. It contains
        then, potentially, all the forms which go forth from it, and
        which always evolve in the same way for each species. </p>
      <p>Such forces are, as M. Dastre has justly observed, "the most
        refractory and the most out of the reach of physico-chemcial
        explanations. How shall we explain", he says, "this unfathomable
        mystery which makes the egg cell, drawing to itself materials
        from without, progressively build up the astonishing
        construction which is the body of an animal or of man himself?".
      </p>
      <p>All our attempts at interpretation of such a phenomenon are so
        perfectly futile, that it is better to give them up than to
        formulate them. The eminent physiologist last quoted points this
        out: "The naturalists give us nothing but words. They speak of
        heredity, of adaptation, of atavism, as if they were real and
        efficient beings, while they are only appellatives and names
        which are applied to collections of facts". </p>
      <p>These terms of adaptation, heredity, etc., are, however, not
        entirely vain words if we use them to simply translate facts of
        observation instead of considering them as explanations. They
        mean simply that forces utterly unknown, and of the nature of
        which we can have no suspicion, oblige the primal cell of a
        being to become an animal or a plant, and to bequeath to the
        beings derived from it the changes to which it has been
        subjected by different actions, such as that of the medium. As
        the cell possesses such powers, we conceive that, in the immense
        ages of the past, forms adapted to all the variations of the
        medium may have succeeded each other. It would seem that with a
        common stock of life, a sort of clay of beings, nature has tried
        numberless combinations, of which some only have been able to
        survive. We meet at the present day in geological debris some
        which seem the fancies of artists haunted by the visions of
        demoniacs. Such are, for instance, the gigantic Diplodocus, the
        Brontosaurus, and others, true dream monsters. </p>
      <p>All these varied efflorescences of life formerly appeared to
        materialists as the fancies of a Creative Power drawing them
        forth periodically from the chaos which preceded the expression
        of his will. The immense service which Darwin rendered to the
        scientific mind was to eliminate the supernatural causes of the
        concatenation of things by making us see that laws which know no
        caprice, such as adaptation, selection, and the survival of the
        fittest, can explain the transformation of living beings. The
        theory of evolution is tending to be in part replaced at the
        present by that of abrupt mutations, the existence of which
        among certain vegetables has been disclosed by patient
        observations. But by showing us the possibility of finding
        scientific explanations in a domain where they seemed to have no
        place, Darwin changed the orientation of ideas in the most
        important branches of scientific activity. During half a century
        the learned world has been inspired by the doctrines of this
        mighty genius. One may say of the Origin of Species what
        Sainte-Beuve formerly wrote of the <i>Esprit des Lois</i>:
        "There is no book which we can quote as having done so much for
        the human race at the time when it appeared, and from which a
        reader of our day can draw so few applicable and positive ideas.
        But this is the destiny of nearly every work which has caused
        the mind of man to progress". </p>
      <p>The theory of abrupt mutations, which has shaken some
        fundamental facts of Darwin’s doctrines, is still in its
        infancy. The mutations which have been observed are rather rare,
        and do not bear upon fundamental characteristics. We have been
        able, however, to make use of them to obtain new species of
        cereals, the characteristics of which are reproduced by heredity
        with regularity and constancy. The scientific and philosophic
        importance of these mutations especially lies in the
        establishment of the notion that certain changes, prepared
        doubtless by an invisible and previous evolution, may take rise
        abruptly. </p>
      <p>This fact will perhaps explain to us why at certain geological
        epochs there have suddenly appeared a whole series of living
        species so different from those which went before and those
        which come after them, as to make it very difficult to establish
        a link between them. The lacunae which science has vainly sought
        to fill should then, as Cuvier thought, be very real. </p>
      <p>We assuredly observe in the succession of beings a certain
        continuity, a general direction, but not that regular and lineal
        continuity which many naturalists still imagine. If the
        evolution of beings is represented by a curve, this curve should
        indeed have a general regular trajectory, but would contain many
        solutions of continuity and loops. </p>
      <p>The evolution of beings seems to have been obtained only at the
        price of repeated essays which seem useless enough to the human
        eye. From the point of view of our limited intelligence, we
        might say that things happen in nature as if they were sometimes
        directed by superior intelligences, and sometimes by absurd
        combinations due to blind grouping of improbable chances. Nature
        seems to be at the same time full of foresight and of blindness.
        It is very possible, however, that both the foresight and
        blindness are only in our minds. She has no doubt as guide and
        as means of action elements which we do not suspect, and we
        cannot in consequence judge her. We must always distrust
        hypotheses made on the subject of a domain which no human eye
        has ever seen. </p>
      <p>Nor is there any occasion to bring into our explanation of
        things supreme beings with whom we are not acquainted. It was by
        eliminating them that science effected her greatest progress. We
        have seen that simple cells realize in the organism chemical
        operations beyond the resources of our laboratories, and act as
        if they were unceasingly guided by a superior intelligence. No
        one imagines, however, that there is such an intelligence behind
        each cell, and there is no occasion to imagine it for the
        aggregate of cells which constitute any animal whatever. Their
        structure disclosed an extremely skillful mechanism directed by
        forces of which at the present day we do not know the nature,
        but which we may hope to one day bring within the cycle of our
        knowledge. </p>
      <p><b>5. The Interpretations o the Phenomena of Life</b> </p>
      <p>What has been said shows that the phenomena of life were always
        the stumbling block of philosophy and physiology. "Physiology",
        writes M. Dastre, "cannot answer the question of the ages --
        What is life?". The philosophers have not been able to answer it
        either, or, at least, none of their answers could bear
        criticism. "Philosophy offers us", writes Dastre, "in order to
        conceive life and death, hypotheses. It offered us the same 30,
        100, 2000 years ago: animism, vitalism under its two forms, or
        the doctrine of vital properties, and finally materialism,
        mechanism, or unicism, or monism (to give it all its names),
        that is to say, the physico-chemical doctrine of life". </p>
      <p>It is this last explanation which predominates at the present
        day. It is not, perhaps, the most certain, but it is certainly
        the most fertile, since it excites researches which render
        useless the vitalistic and animistic theories which endow living
        beings with an incomprehensible power -- the soul or vital
        principle -- the power of which dispenses us from seeking
        further for explanations. </p>
      <p>The true problem which now presents itself for solution, and
        will doubtless do so for a long time yet, is this: Have vital
        and psychic manifestations distinct causes? Are the vital forces
        absolutely different from those with which we are acquainted? Do
        they represent an independent and irreducible category? Is it
        possible to pass from the laws of crude matte to those of living
        matter? </p>
      <p>Up till now we have found no bridge capable of linking together
        these two orders of phenomena, and the gulf which separates them
        appears yet deeper if among the vital forces we include the
        psychical phenomena which end in intelligence. </p>
      <p>This link which we do not see will perhaps some day appear, and
        we may already guess how it will be found. As continuity seems a
        general law of nature, it is not in the higher being that the
        vital and psychical phenomena must be studied, because there
        their complication makes them too inexplicable. But by
        descending to the very first stages of life we shall discover
        the outline of an explanation of psychical&nbsp; phenomena.
        Among quite primitive beings, such as a globule of protoplasm,
        we observe, as several volumes of researches have shown, acts
        well adapted to the end to be achieved and varying according to
        the circumstances, as if the being were capable of rudimentary
        reason. But these are perhaps only physico-chemical reactions
        generated by external excitants. Their interpretation by the
        hypothesis of simple reaction is very insufficient. We are
        evidently confronted by a chain of causalities of which we
        possess no single link, and which consequently we do not
        understand. We shall not penetrate any further into them by
        imagining, to explain them, immaterial principles endowed with
        the attributes we ourselves lend them. This would be to return
        to the time when the will of Jupiter produced the thunder and
        that of Ceres the crops. </p>
      <p>The learned ought to shun supernatural explanations, and also
        those which are too simple. The materialist and spiritualist
        interpretations are only words devoid of all worth and only of
        interest to those minds which prefer any explanation to none at
        all. </p>
      <p>We must seek, and not invent explanations. The book of nature
        is one which takes long to read. The few pages painfully
        deciphered after centuries of effort show us a universe much
        more complicated than it appeared at first. Our sciences are
        built up on concepts representing merely interpretations capable
        of adapting themselves to the little fragments of things which
        are within the reach of our intelligence. </p>
      <p>If it be true that we do not know the causes of life, nor even
        the final reason of a single phenomenon, nothing warrants our
        saying that we shall always be ignorant of them, We confine
        ourselves within a barren philosophy when we declare unknowable
        that which is only unknown as yet. Science descends a little
        further each day into the mysterious gulfs where the last
        elements of things lie hid. But as a philosopher has rightly
        said, our sounding-rod is still too short for the immensity of
        such abysses. </p>
