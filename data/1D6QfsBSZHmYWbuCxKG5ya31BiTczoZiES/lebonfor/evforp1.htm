      <p>In the following pages, Dr Gustave Le Bon develops further the
        strikingly novel and original theories put forward by him in <i>The






          Evolution of Matter</i> (Paris 1905). As in the last-named
        work, he enunciated the doctrine, which he was the first to
        deduce, that all matter is continually in a state of
        dissociation and decay, so in this he goes in detail into the
        corollary, there only briefly stated, that the atom is a great
        reservoir of energy, and itself the source of most of the forces
        of the universe. In support of this position, he calls in the
        aid of his earlier researches into the nature of invisible
        radiations, phosphorescence, and the Hertzian waves, all which,
        with several related phenomena, he declares to be explicable by
        the hypothesis that the atom, on dissociating, sets free, either
        wholly or in part, the energy stored up within it on its
        formation. Yet he is careful to declare that this is rather
        suggested than demonstrated by his researches, and that the
        conclusive proof of the validity of his assertion must be
        delayed for the result of further experiments by himself or
        others. </p>
      <p>In the meantime, it is well to notice that both Dr Le Bon’s
        original thesis and its corollary have received approval from an
        unexpected quarter. Every new scientific theory, if sufficiently
        far-reaching, is received with disapproval by those brought up
        on the ideas it would supplant, and Dr Le Bon’s assertion of the
        universal dissociation of matter formed no exception to this
        rule. In France, as he reminds us in <i>The Evolution of Matter</i>,
        his first discovery of the phenomena which he classed together
        under the odd name of "Black Light", aroused a perfect storm of
        obloquy which has long since died away. In England, whither his
        theories penetrated only after they had been in great part
        accepted by the scientific world, this was not the case; but two
        members of the Cavendish Laboratory at Cambridge took upon
        themselves, upon the appearance of <i>The Evolution of Matter</i>,
        to assail its teaching as well as its novelty with ore virulence
        than force (See the <i>Athenaeum</i> of Feb 17 and 24 and of
        March 3, 10, 17, and 24, 1906; and the <i>Jahrbuch fur
          Elektronik</i> ii (1905), p. 459 et seq.). It is therefore
        pleasing to find Mr P. D. Innes, himself a member of the
        Cavendish Laboratory, writing, with the apparent approval of its
        Director, in the <i>Proceedings of the Royal Society</i> (A,
        vol. lxxix, No. 4 (Sept 1907), p. 442.), with regard to
        radioactive phenomena, that: </p>
      <p>"The only theory which can satisfactorily account for the
        phenomena observed is that of atomic disintegration, a process
        that is apparently going on in several, if not all, of the
        elements"; </p>
      <p>and further (p. 443): </p>
      <p>"That there is a great store of energy in the atom seems now
        beyond question, and if this reservoir could only become
        available, all our present conditions might be completely
        revolutionized." </p>
      <p>This is exactly -- as any one can see for himself -- the
        position taken by Dr Le Bon in <i>The Evolution of Matter</i>,
        and further defined and emphasized by hi in the present work.
        There seems therefore good reason to suppose that Dr Le Bon’s
        later theories, as well as his earlier ones, are now widely
        accepted by men of science, and that before long this acceptance
        will be extended to all points of his doctrine. </p>
      <p>It should be noted that the present work was written expressly
        for the International Science Series, and was intended to appear
        simultaneously in England and France. Difficulties connected
        with the reproduction of the illustrations have caused the
        appearance of this version to lag some months behind the French,
        of which 8 editions of 1000 copies apiece have been rapidly
        exhausted. The delay has not been useless, as it has enabled me
        to add a few corrections and notes, together with indexes, which
        are wanting in the French editions. </p>

      <p>Every philosopher devoted to the study of subjects with rather
        vague outlines and uncertain conclusions, such as Psychology,
        Politics, or History; who had a few years ago to peruse a work
        on Physical Science, must have been struck by the clearness of
        the definitions, the exactness of the demonstrations, and the
        precision of the experiments. Everything was strictly linked
        together and interpreted. By the side of the most complicated
        phenomenon there was always figured its explanation. </p>
      <p>If this same philosopher had the curiosity to look for the
        general principles on which these precise sciences were founded,
        he could not but be compelled to admire their marvelous
        simplicity and their imposing grandeur. Chemistry and mechanics
        had the indestructible atom for their foundation, physics the
        indestructible energy. Learned equations, produced either by
        experiments or by pure reasoning, united by rigid formulas the
        four fundamental elements of things -- i.e., time, space, matter
        and force. All the bodies in the universe, from the gigantic
        star describing its eternal revolutions in space down to the
        infinitesimal grain of dust which the wind seems to blow about
        at will, were subject to their laws. </p>
      <p>We were right to be proud of such a science, the fruit of
        centuries of effort. To it was due the unity and simplicity
        which everywhere reigned. A few minds enamored of formulas
        thought it possible to simplify them further by taking into
        account only the mathematical relations between phenomena. These
        last appeared to them solely as manifestations of one great
        entity, viz.: energy. A few differential equations sufficed to
        explain all the facts discovered by observation. The principal
        researches of science consisted in discovering new formulas that
        from that moment became universal laws which nature was forced
        to obey. </p>
      <p>Before such important results, the philosopher bent low, and
        acknowledged that if but little certainty existed in the
        surrounding in which he lived, at least it could be found in the
        domain of pure science. How could he doubt it? Did he not notice
        that the majority of learned men were so sure of their
        demonstrations that not even the shadow of a doubt ever crossed
        their minds? </p>
      <p>Placed above the changing flux of things, above the chaos of
        unstable and contradictory opinions, the chaos of unstable and
        contradictory opinions, they dwelt in that serene region of the
        absolute where all uncertainty vanishes and where shines the
        dazzling light of pure truth. </p>
      <p>Our great scientific theories are not all very ancient and
        great, since the cycle of precise experimental science hardly
        covers more than three centuries. This period, relatively so
        short, reveals two very distinct phases of evolution in the
        minds of scholars. </p>
      <p>The first is the period of confidence and certainty to which I
        have just referred. In the face of the daily increase of
        discoveries, especially during the first half of the last
        century, the philosophical and religious dogmas on which our
        conception of the universe had for so long been based, faded and
        vanished completely. No complaint was raised. Were not absolute
        truths to replace the former uncertainties of ancient beliefs?
        The founders of each new science imagined that they had once for
        all built up for that science a framework which only needed
        filling in. This scientific edifice once built up, it would
        alone remain standing on the ruins of the vain imaginings and
        illusions of the past. The scientific creed was complete. No
        doubt it presented nature as regardless of mankind and the
        heavens as tenantless; but it was hoped to repeople the latter
        at an early date and to set up for adoration new idols, somewhat
        wooden perhaps, but which at least would never play us false. </p>
      <p>This happy confidence in the great dogmas of modern science
        remained unaltered until the quite recent day when unforeseen
        discoveries condemned scientific thought to suffer doubts from
        which it imagined itself forever free. The edifice of which the
        fissures were only visible to a few superior intelligences has
        been suddenly and violently shaken. Contradictions and
        impossibilities, hardly perceptible at first, have become
        striking. The disillusion was so rapid that, in a short space of
        time, the question arose whether the principles which seemingly
        constituted the most certain foundations of our knowledge in
        physics were not simply fragile hypotheses which wrapped
        profound ignorance in a delusive veil. Then that befell
        scientific dogmas which formerly happened to religious dogmas so
        soon as any one dared discuss them. The hour of criticism was
        quickly followed by the hour of decadence, and then by that of
        disappearance and oblivion. </p>
      <p>No doubt those great principles of which science was so proud
        have not yet perished entirely. For a long time they will
        continue to be positive truths to the multitude and will be
        propagated in elementary textbooks, but they have already lost
        their prestige in the eyes of real scholars. The discoveries
        just alluded to have simply accentuated the uncertainties which
        the latest works had already commenced to reveal; and it is thus
        that science herself has entered into a phase of anarchy from
        which she might have been thought forever safe. Principles which
        appeared to have a sure mathematical foundation are now
        contested by those whose profession it is to teach and defend
        them. Such profound books as <i>La Science et l’Hypothese</i>
        of M. Henri Poincare give proofs of this on nearly every page.
        Even in the domain of mathematics, this illustrious scholar has
        shown that we only subsist on hypotheses and conventions. </p>
      <p>One of M. Poincare’s most eminent colleagues in the institute,
        the mathematician Emile Picard, has shown in one of his
        publications how "incoherent" are the present principles of
        another almost fundamental science -- mechanics. He says: “At
        the end of the 18th century, the principles of mechanics seemed
        to defy all criticism, and the work of the founders of the
        science of motion formed a block which seemed for ever safe
        against the lapse of time. Since that epoch, searching analysis
        has examined the foundations of the edifice with a magnifying
        glass. As a matter of fact, where learned men like Lagrange and
        Laplace deemed everything quite simple, we today meet with the
        most serious difficulties. Every one who has had to teach the
        first steps of mechanics, and who has troubled to think for
        himself, has experienced how incoherent are the more or less
        traditional explanations of its principles". </p>
      <p>The principles of mechanics, which are apparently most simple,
        writes Prof. Mach in his <i>History of Mechanics</i>, "are of a
        very complicated nature. They are based on unrealized, and even
        on unrealizable, experiments. In no way can they be considered
        in themselves as demonstrated mathematical truths". </p>
      <p>At the present time we possess three systems of mechanics, each
        of which declares the other two to be absurd. Even if none of
        them, perhaps, deserves this qualification, they may at least be
        considered very incoherent, and as furnishing no acceptable
        expantion of phenomena. </p>
      <p>"There hardly now exist", writes M. Lucien Poincare, "any of
        those great theories once universally admitted, to which, by
        common consent, all searchers subscribed. A certain anarchy
        reigns in the domain of the natural sciences, all presumptions
        are allowed, and no law appears rigidly necessary... We are
        witnessing at this moment, rather a demolition than a definite
        work of construction... The ideas which to our predecessors
        seemed strongly established are now controverted... Today the
        idea that all phenomena are capable of mechanical explanations
        is generally abandoned... The very principles of mechanics are
        contests, and recent facts unsettle our belief in the absolute
        value of laws hitherto considered fundamental". </p>
      <p>Assuredly the great theories which dominated the science of
        each epoch, and gave direction to its studies, did not remain
        forever undisputed. After an existence generally pretty long,
        they slowly vanished, but did not give place to new doctrines,
        until these last were strongly founded. Today the old principles
        are dead or dying, and those destined to replace them are only
        in course of formation. Modern man destroys faster than he
        builds. The legacies of the past are merely shadows. Gods,
        ideas, dogmas, and creeds vanish one after the other. Before new
        edifices capable of sheltering our thoughts can be built, many
        ruins will have crumbled into dust. We are still in an age of
        destruction, and therefore of anarchy. </p>
      <p>Noting, fortunately, is more favorable to progress than this
        anarchy. The world is full of things we do not see, and it is of
        the erroneous or insufficient ideas imposed by the traditions of
        classic teachings that the bandage is woven which covers our
        sight. History shows to what degree scientific theories retard
        progress so soon as they have acquired a certain fixity. A fresh
        forward only becomes possible after a sufficient dissociation of
        the earlier ideas. To point out error and to follow up its
        consequences is at times as useful as discovering new facts.
        Perhaps the most dangerous thing to the progress of the human
        mind is to place before readers -- as is invariably the case
        with all educational works -- uncertainties as indisputable
        truths, and to presume to impose limits to science, or, as
        Auguste Comte wished to do, to the knowable. The celebrated
        philosopher even proposed the creation of an Areopagus of
        scholars with the mission of fixing limits to the researches
        which should be permitted. Such tribunals are, unfortunately,
        already too numerous, and no one can be unaware how baneful has
        been their influence. </p>
      <p>There should therefore be no hesitation to examine closely the
        fundamental dogmas of science for the sole reason that they are
        venerated and at first sight appear indestructible. The great
        merit of Descartes lay in his viewing as doubtful what down to
        his time had been considered uncontested truth. Too often do we
        forget the scientific idols of the present day have no more
        right to invulnerability than those of the past. </p>
      <p>The two dogmas of modern science formerly most respected were
        those of the indestructibility of matter and energy. The first
        was already 2000 years old, and all discoveries had only tended
        to confirm it. By a marvelous exception, the strangeness of
        which struck no one, while all things in the universe were
        condemned to perish, matter remained indestructible. The beings
        formed by the combinations of atoms had but an ephemeral
        existence; but they were composed of immortal elements. Created
        at the beginning of the ages, these elements defied the action
        of centuries and, like the gods of ancient legends, enjoyed
        eternal youth. </p>
      <p>Matter was not, however, alone in possessing this privilege of
        immortality. The Forces -- which are now termed Energy -- were
        equally indestructible. This last might incessantly change its
        form, but the quantity of it in the world remained invariable. A
        form of energy could not disappear without being replaced by
        another equivalent one. </p>
      <p>I have devoted nearly 10 years of the experimental researched
        summarized in my book, <i>The Evolution of Matter</i>, to
        proving that the first of the above-mentioned dogmas can no
        longer be maintained, and that matter also must enter into the
        cycle of things condemned to grow old and die. But if matter be
        perishable, can we suppose that energy alone enjoys the
        privilege of immortality? The dogma of the conservation of
        energy still retains so much prestige that no criticism seems to
        shake it. In this work we shall have to discuss its value, and
        this study will necessitate many others. My own experimental
        researches have lead me to explore somewhat different chapters
        of physics without much heeding what was taught regarding them.
        Notwithstanding the necessarily fragmentary character of these
        researches, they will perhaps interest those readers whose
        scientific beliefs are not yet settled. </p>
      <p>What has finally given very great force to certain principles
        of physics and mechanics has been the very complicated
        mathematical apparatus in which they have been wrapped.
        Everything presented in an algebraic form at once acquires for
        certain minds the character of indisputable truth. The most
        perfect skeptic willingly attributes a mysterious virtue to
        equations and bows to their supposed power. They tend more and
        more to replace, in teaching, reason and experiments. These
        delusive veils which now surround the most simple principles
        only too often serve to mask uncertainties. It is by lifting
        them that I have succeeded more than once in showing the frailty
        of scientific beliefs which for many scholars possess the
        authority of revealed dogmas. </p>

      <p>Newton, wrote Lagrange, was the greatest, and, at the same
        time, the most fortunate of geniuses, for one does not more than
        once in a way find a universe in want of a system. </p>
      <p>In saying this, the illustrious mathematician was evidently
        persuaded that the system of the universe must be considered as
        established once and for all. This simple belief has no longer
        many adherents. It now appears pretty clearly that we know very
        little of the general laws of out universe. We can only dimly
        see in the far-off future the epoch when these laws will be
        established. It is, however, already felt that the actual
        mechanism of the world differs greatly from that constructed by
        the science of the past. We now feel ourselves surrounded by
        gigantic forces of which we can only get a glimpse, and which
        obey laws unknown to us. </p>
      <p>Ideas necessarily follow one another in a chain. A new theory
        cannot be started without bringing with it a series of equally
        new consequences. After I had proved that the dissociation of
        atoms was a universal phenomenon, and that matter is an immense
        reservoir of an energy hitherto unsuspected in spite of its
        colossal grandeur, I was naturally led to ask myself whether all
        the forces of the universe -- notably solar heat and electricity
        -- did not proceed solely from this reservoir of energy, and
        therefore from the dissociation of matter. </p>
      <p>As regards solar heat, the source of most terrestrial energies,
        dissociation appeared sufficient to explain the maintenance of
        the sun’s temperature on the hypothesis that the atoms of
        incandescent stars must have contained more intra-atomic energy
        than they possess when once grown cool. As regards electricity,
        I recall the result of my experiments: -- that the particles
        emitted by an electrified point are identical with those which
        come forth from a radioactive body such as radium. This fact
        proves that electricity also is a product of the
        dematerialization of matter. </p>
      <p>The phenomenon of the dissociation of atoms presented therefore
        consequences of considerable importance, since it was possible
        to regard it as the origin of the forces of the universe. Matter
        became a simple reservoir of forces, and could itself be
        considered as a relatively stable form of energy. This
        conception caused the disappearance of the classic dichotomy
        between matter and energy, and between matter and the ether. It
        allowed us to connect the two worlds of the Ponderable and the
        Imponderable, once considered very distinct, which science
        believed she had definitely separated. Berthelot even asserted
        at the recent inauguration of the Lavoisier monument, that the
        distinction between ponderable matter and imponderable agencies
        is one of the greatest discoveries ever made". </p>
      <p>It now seems, however, that physicists should have seen a long
        time ago -- that is, long before the recent discoveries -- that
        matter and the ether are intimately connected, that they are
        unceasingly interchanging energies, and are in no way separate
        worlds. Matter continuously emits luminous or calorific
        radiations, and can absorb them. Down to the absolute zero it
        radiates continuously -- that is to say, it emits ethereal
        vibrations. The agitations of matter propagate themselves in the
        ether, and those of the ether in matter, and without this
        propagation there would be neither heat nor light. The ether and
        matter are one thing under different forms, and we cannot put
        them asunder. If we had not taken as a starting point the narrow
        view that light and heat are imponderable agents because they
        appear to add nothing to the weight of bodies, the distinction
        between the ponderable and imponderable, to which scholars
        attach so much importance, would have long ago vanished. </p>
      <p>The ether is doubtless a mysterious agent which we have not yet
        learnt to isolate, but its reality is manifest, since no
        phenomenon can be explained without it. Its existence now seems
        to several physicists more certain than even that of matter. It
        cannot be isolated, but it is impossible to say it cannot be
        seen or touched. It is, on the contrary, the substance we most
        often see and touch. When a body radiates the heat which warms
        or burns us, what constitutes this heat, if it be not the
        vibrations of the ether? When we see a green landscape on the
        ground glass of a camera obscura, what constitutes this image,
        if not the ether? </p>
      <p>The theory of the dissociation of matter has not only served to
        clear away the two great dichotomies, force and matter,
        ponderable and imponderable, which seemed established forever.
        The doctrine of the vanishing of matter by its transformation
        into energy carries with it important consequences in regard to
        current ideas of energy. </p>
      <p>According to the most fundamental principles of mechanics, when
        we communicate to a material body a determined quantity of
        energy, this energy may be transformed, but the body will never
        give back a quantity in excess of that received by it. This
        principle was considered too self-evident ever to have been
        disputed. In fact it was indisputable so long as it was admitted
        that matter could only give up the energy transmitted to it and
        was unable to create any. By showing that matter is an immense
        reservoir of energy, I at the same time proved that the quantity
        of energy it emits, under the influence of an outside force
        acting on it as a kind of excitant, may far exceed that which it
        has received. </p>
      <p>With such a very slight excitement as that of a thin pencil of
        invisible ultraviolet radiations, -- or even with no excitement
        at all, we observe in the emission of spontaneously dissociating
        bodies such as radium, -- we can obtain considerable quantities
        of energy. No doubt, we do not create this liberated energy,
        since it already exists in matter, but we obtain it under
        conditions which the old laws of mechanics could never have
        imagined. The idea that matte cold be transformed into energy
        would have seemed absolutely absurd only a very few years ago. </p>
      <p>It will be part of the science of the future to discover the
        means of freeing, in a practical form, the considerable forces
        which matter contains. </p>
      <p>"Intra-atomic energy, scientifically brought into play",
        recently wrote M. Ferrand, "will create the totally new science
        of modern Energetics: it will give us the formula of the
        thermodynamic potential of energy freed from matter. Turned
        commercially to account, it is capable of turning upside down
        the productive activity of our old world". </p>
      <p>The researches which I have set forth in numerous papers for
        the last 10 years have rapidly spread through the laboratories,
        and have been largely utilized, especially by those physicists
        who have not quoted them. Some of my propositions, considered
        very revolutionary when first formulated, are now beginning to
        be almost commonplace, although they are far from having yet
        produced all their consequences. When those last are unfolded,
        they will lead to the renewal of a great part of a scientific
        edifice the stability of which seemed eternal. </p>
      <p>It is useful to prove that this edifice, so stable in
        appearance, is far from being so, and that things may be viewed
        from very different points from those to which our regular
        education has accustomed us. It is to the demonstration of this
        that a portion of this work will be devoted. </p>
      <p>The fundamental principles which will guide us are those
        enumerated in my preceding work, which I repeat: -- </p>
      <p>1. Matter, hitherto deemed indestructible, slowly vanishes by
        the continuous dissociation of its component atoms. </p>
      <p>2. The products of the dematerialization of matter constitute
        substances placed by their properties between ponderable bodies
        and the imponderable ether -- that is to say, between two worlds
        hitherto considered as widely separate. </p>
      <p>3. Matter, formerly regarded as inert and only able to give
        back the energy originally supplied to it, is, on the other
        hand, a colossal reservoir of energy -- intra-atomic energy --
        which it can expend without borrowing anything from without. </p>
      <p>4. It is from the intra-atomic energy liberated during the
        dissociation of matter that most of the forces in the universe
        are derived, and notably electricity and solar heat. </p>
      <p>5. Force and matter are two different forms of one and the same
        thing. Matter represents a stable form of intra-atomic energy:
        heat, light, electricity, etc., represent unstable forms of it.
      </p>
      <p>6. By the dissociation of atoms -- that is to say by the
        materialization of matter, the stable form of energy termed
        matter is simply changed into those unstable forms known by the
        names of electricity, light, heat, etc., matter therefore is
        continuously transformed into energy. </p>
      <p>7. The law of evolution applicable to living beings is also
        applicable to simple bodies; chemical species are no more
        invariable than are living species. </p>
      <p>8. Energy is no more indestructible than the matter from which
        it emanates. </p>

      </center>
      <p><i>1. The Conception of the Irreducible Magnitudes of the
          Universe</i> </p>
      <p>Time, space, matter and force form the elements of things, and
        the fundamental basis of all our knowledge. </p>
      <p>Time and space are the two magnitudes in which we confine the
        universe. Force is the cause of phenomena, matter their web. </p>
      <p>Three of these elements -- time, space, and force -- are quite
        irreducible. Matter may be reconverted into force, not only
        because it is, as I have proved, a particular form of energy,
        but also because it is only defined, in equations of mechanics,
        by the symbols fo force (1). </p>
      <p>[(1) In the CGS system now generally adopted for the evaluation
        of the magnitudes of physical quantities, we take into
        consideration: (1) the fundamental quality, length, mass, and
        time; and (2) the derived quantities. These last, which are very
        numerous, comprise notably the derived quantities of geometry --
        surface, volume, and angle; those of mechanics -- speed,
        acceleration, force, energy, work, power, etc.; and those of
        electricity and magnetism -- resistance, intensity, potential
        difference, etc.] </p>
      <p>Time, space, and force being irreducible, cannot be compared
        with anything and are indefinable. We only know of them that
        which our common sense tells us. So soon as, in order to define
        these great entities, we endeavor to go beyond what is revealed
        by ordinary observation, we meet with inextricable difficulties
        and end by acknowledging, as do the philosophers, that they are
        simply creations of the mind, and cover completely unknown
        realities. </p>
      <p>These realities are not knowable to us, because our senses ever
        remain interposed between them and us. What we perceive of the
        universe are only the impressions produced on our senses. The
        form we give to things is conditioned by the nature of our
        intelligence. Time and space are, then, subjective notions
        imposed by our senses on the representation of things, and this
        is why Kant considered time and space as forms of sensibility.
        To a superior intelligence, capable of grasping at the same time
        the order of succession and that of the co-existence of
        phenomena, our notions of space and time would have no meaning.
      </p>
      <p>It is, moreover, not space and time only, but all phenomena,
        from matter which we think we know up to the divinities created
        by our dreams, which have to be considered as forms necessary
        for our understanding. The world constructed with the
        impressions of our senses is a summary translation, and
        necessarily a far from faithful one of the real world which we
        know not. Time is, for man, nothing but a relation between
        events. He measures it by the changes in position of a mobile
        body, such as a star or a clock. It is only by a change, that is
        to say, by movement, that the notion of time is accessible to
        us. "In a world void of all kind of movement", says Kant, "there
        would not be seen the slightest sequence in the internal state
        of substances. Hence, the abolition of the relation of
        substances to one another carries with it the annihilation of
        sequence and of time". If there are no events there is evidently
        no sequence, and consequently no time. </p>
      <p>To immobilize the world and the beings which inhabit it would
        be to immobilize time -- that is to say, to cause it to vanish.
        If this fixedness were absolute, life would be impossible, since
        life implies change; but neither could anything grow old. The
        immortal gods who, according to the legends, never undergo
        change, cannot know time. For them the clock of heaven marks
        always the same hour. Change is therefore the true generator of
        time [** Ed.: -- see Kozyrev]. It is only conceivable, like
        forces and all phenomena, under the form of movement. This
        fundamental concept of movement will be found at the base of all
        phenomena. It serves to define the magnitudes of the universe,
        and can only be defined by them. It is not an irreducible
        concept, for it is formed by the combination of the notions of
        force, of matter, of space, and of time. It is evident that we
        require the intervention of all these in order to define the
        displacement of a body. </p>
      <p>In physics the most variations of quantities are expressed by
        reference to the variations of time. When the curve expressing
        the relations of a phenomenon with time is known, science can go
        back from the present to the past and can know the future. </p>
      <p>The notion of space is as little clear as that of time.
        Leibnitz defined it as the order of co-existence of phenomena,
        time being the order of their succession. Space and time are
        perhaps two forms of the same thing. </p>
      <p>Space does not appear conceivable without the existence of
        bodies. A world entirely void could not give birth to the idea
        of space, and this is the reason philosophers refuse to space an
        objective reality. In their view, space being, like time, a
        quality, where there is neither phenomenon nor substance, there
        is neither space nor time. </p>
      <p>The above brief expose’ suffices to show how inexact and
        limited are the ideas man can form as to the fundamental
        elements of the universe. Our knowledge being only relative, we
        only define with a known one. All knowledge therefore implies a
        comparison, but to what can we compare the irreducible elements
        of things? They condition phenomena, and remain hidden behind
        them. </p>
      <p>If the irreducible magnitudes of the universe are not known in
        their essence, they at least produce measurable effects. We are
        situated with regard to them like the railway porter who can
        weigh with exactness parcels the content of which he is
        ignorant. </p>
      <p>It is of these measurements alone that science is composed. By
        means of them are established the numerical relations which form
        to one web of our knowledge, since the realities which uphold
        them escape us. The properties of things are only properly
        definable by measurement. The qualitative represents a
        subjective appreciation which may vary from one individual to
        another. The quantitative represents a fixed magnitude which can
        be preserved, and which gives precision to our sensations. The
        substitution of the quantitative for the qualitative is the
        principle task of the scholar. "I often say", writes Lord
        Kelvin, "that if you measure that of which you speak, and can
        express it by a number, you know something of your subject; but
        if you cannot measure it, your knowledge is meager and
        unsatisfactory". </p>
      <p><i>2. The Measurement of the Irreducible Magnitudes of the
          Universe</i> </p>
      <p>By measuring and placing one on the other the heterogeneous
        elements which form the web of things, science has managed to
        create certain concepts, such as those of mass, kinetic energy,
        etc., which we have to consider realities by reason of our
        incapacity to imagine others. </p>
      <p>These concepts vary with the way in which we bring together the
        irreducible elements of things. Associate force with space, and
        we create the science of energy. Associate space and time, and
        we create the science of velocities -- that is to say,
        kinematics. Associate force, space and time, and we create the
        science of mechanical power. It is evident that, by thus acting,
        we must associate very heterogeneous elements. </p>
      <p>Force ( F = MA ) is a coefficient of resistance multiplied by
        an acceleration. Work ( T = F x E ) is a force multiplied by a
        length. Velocity ( V = L/T ) is a space divided by a time. Mass
        (M = P/g) is a weight divided by a velocity, etc.) It is only by
        the combination of these very different magnitudes, that it has
        been possible to state precisely the concepts of mechanics on
        which the interpretation of the phenomena of the universe is
        still based. </p>
      <p>To define completely a phenomenon there have to be associated
        the three great coordinates of things -- time, space, and force.
        If one or two of these only are measured, the phenomenon is only
        partially known. The formation of the modern notions of energy
        and of power furnishes excellent examples of this. They were no
        precisely stated until to the vague idea of force considered as
        the synonym of effort was added the notion of space, and then
        that of time. </p>
      <p>In mechanics, force is defined as a cause of movement; the unit
        of force is represented by the acceleration produced on the unit
        of mass. When a force displaces its point of application it
        generates work. This last is the product of the force considered
        as a cause of movement. The kilogram-meter has been chosen as
        the unit of work. It is the work necessary to displace a
        kilogram for the length of a meter. This unit of mechanical
        energy is now used to measure all forms of energy. </p>
      <p>Thus, by the sole fact that we have associated space with
        force, we can measure this last and comprise it in a formula.
        This enables us to understand how with an invariable quantity of
        energy we can produce forces of variable magnitude. If, in fact,
        we call the Force F, the Space E, and the work T, we obtain
        according to the preceding definitions T = F x E. In this
        formula, which defines the unit of work, the force F and the
        space E can evidently be inversely varied without changing their
        product -- that is to say, the work. We can therefore largely
        increase the force on condition that we proportionately reduce
        the space covered. It is this operation which is affected by
        certain machines, such as the lever, which multiplies the force
        but not the work. By the expenditure of one kilogram-meter,
        hundreds of kilogram-meters can be raised, but what is gained in
        force will be lost in the space covered, and the product F x E
        will never exceed a kilogram-meter. Force therefore can be
        multiplied, but not energy, of which the magnitude remains
        invariable. </p>
      <p>Into the unit of work there enter only the elements force and
        space, but not the element time. One kilogram-meter may be
        expended in one second or in a thousand years, and the results
        will necessarily be very different I the two cases. This is very
        well illustrated in the case of radium, of which one gram
        contains thousands of kilogram-meters. Such a force appears
        immense, but its production is in each instant so slight that it
        would require thousands of years to liberate it entirely. It is
        the case of a reservoir containing an immense quantity of water
        which can escape by a drop at a time. Hence, by confining
        ourselves to the association force and space, we have already
        created a unit which permits us to evaluate in kilogram-meters
        the power of any machine moved by any motor, but it does not
        tell us if these kilogram-meters are produced in one minute or
        in a year. We know therefore very little of the power of the
        machine. </p>
      <p>To ascertain this, it suffices to superimpose on the two
        elements force and space, which give us the unit of work, the
        element time. We shall then have what is called the unit of
        power, which is the quotient of the work by the time. It shows
        us the work produced in a given time. If we are told that a
        machine produces a kilogram-meter, we know nothing as to its
        power. If it be added that this kilogram-meter is produced in
        one second, we are fully informed. </p>
      <p>The kilogram-meter per second being too small a unit from the
        commercial point of view, one 75 times larger has been adopted.
        This is the horsepower, which represents 75 kilograms raised one
        meter in one second (1). </p>
      <p>[(1) In physics other units are often made use of, but we do
        not alter what has been said. If, instead of being evaluated in
        kilograms, the force is evaluated in dynes, and if the space,
        instead of being evaluated in meters, is measured in
        centimeters, the work, instead of being expressed in
        kilogram-meters, is expressed in ergs.] </p>
      <p>In this last unit are found collected, as will be seen, the
        three irreducible elements of things -- time, space, and force.
        Matter likewise figures init indirectly, for that which is
        measured is the force employed to combat its inertia and to give
        it certain movements. </p>
      <p>We have just seen how, by enclosing in space and time that
        mysterious Proteus called force, it is possible to grasp it and
        know it under its deceiving forms. On penetrating further into
        the inmost nature of phenomena, we shall see that space and time
        not only serve to measure force, but that they also condition
        its form and its magnitude. </p>

        <b><font size="+1">The Great Constants of the Universe:
            Resistance and Movement</font></b></center>
      <p><i>1. Inertia or Resistance to Change</i> </p>
      <p>Forces are known to us solely by the movements they generate.
        Mechanics, which claims to be the foundation of the other
        sciences and to explain the universe, is devoted to the study of
        these movements. </p>
      <p>The notion of movement implies that of things to move.
        Observation sows that these things to move present a certain
        resistance. The resistance of matter to movement or to a change
        of movement is what is termed its inertia. It is from this
        property that is derived the notion of mass. </p>
      <p>We thus find ourselves in the presence of two elements, not
        irreducible like those just studied, but fundamental. These are
        movement and resistance to movement, or, in other words, change
        and resistance to change. Inertia -- that is to say, the
        aptitude of matter to resist movement or a change in movement --
        is the most important of its properties, and even the only one
        which allows us to follow it through all its modifications.
        While its other characteristics, solidity, color, etc., depend
        on several variable causes and consequently may change, inertia
        depends on no factor and is unchangeable. Whether it be liquid,
        solid or gaseous, whether it be isolated or in combination, the
        same body possesses an unvarying quantity of inertia. Measured
        indirectly by the balance, this allows us to follow it through
        all its changes. </p>
      <p>On this notion of the invariability of inertia, or, in other
        words, of the mass, are based the edifices of chemistry and
        mechanics. The preponderant part played by inertia in phenomena
        is a matter of daily observation. It is by virtue of inertia
        that the worlds continue to circulate in space, that a ball
        hurled from a cannon by the explosion of gunpowder travels
        several thousand meters. Inertia being opposed to a change of
        movement, bodies would even continue their course indefinitely
        if different antagonistic forces, such as the resistance of the
        air, did not finally arrest them. A railway train would thus
        continue to advance with the same velocity without the help of
        any motor if its inertia did not unceasingly tend to be annulled
        by various resistances, friction, etc., which the locomotive
        only serves to overcome. The same inertia of matter forbids the
        train stopping abruptly. To effect this, very powerful brakes
        must be employed even if the engine has ceased working. Inertia
        being opposed to movement as well as to change of movement, it
        requires a very great force to start the train from its repose,
        and one equally great to stop it when once in motion. </p>
      <p>It results therefore from the principle of inertia that, when a
        moving body tends to slacken speed from any cause whatsoever,
        inertia tends to maintain that speed, since, by its definition,
        it is opposed to change of movement. Conversely, when the speed
        of the moving body increases, inertia comes in to retard this
        acceleration for the same reason, viz., that it is opposed to
        change of movement. </p>
      <p>Electricity, which possesses, or at least appears to possess,
        inertia, behaves like matter in motion. Its inertia acts in the
        phenomena of induction exactly, as has been said above, by
        opposing itself to change of movement -- that is to say, in the
        converse direction to the cause which tends to produce its
        slackening or acceleration. This is expressed by the law of
        Lenz, which governs the phenomena of induction. It would perhaps
        be possible to explain them on the principle of the equality of
        action and reaction without invoking inertia at all. To measure
        the inertia of matter is easy, to note its properties is
        likewise easy, but to explain its nature is as yet impossible. </p>
      <p>Newton, who was the first to study inertia scientifically,
        considered it to be a force. "The force which dwells in matter",
        he says, "is its power of resistance, and it is by this force
        that every body perseveres of itself in its actual state of
        repose or of movement in a straight line". </p>
      <p>At the present day, the tendency is to admit that matter is
        connected with the ether by lines of force, and that the whole
        of the inertia of matter should be that of the ether gripped by
        lines of force. But whether inertia be attributed to matter or
        to the medium in which it is plunged, this does not bring us any
        nearer to an explanation. </p>
      <p>Perhaps the least improbable thing that may be said regarding
        inertia is that matter, being, as I have shown, an immense
        aggregate of forces, possesses certain relations of equilibrium
        with the ether surrounding it. The movement of a body must break
        up this equilibrium and create others, from which would result
        the continuation of the movement and its resistance to change of
        speed. In the internal equilibrium of a body in motion something
        is probably changed. </p>
      <p>To the notion of inertia there should, doubtless, be attached
        the principle of the equality of action and reaction. Although
        this is a fundamental principle in mechanics, it, too, is very
        little explicable. It has been formulated by Newton as follows:
        -- </p>
      <p>"A body exercising on another a pressure or traction, receives
        from the latter an equal and opposite traction or pressure".
        This would signify that if you exercise a traction of 100
        kilograms on an infinitely rigid wall it will exercise the same
        traction on you. The wall thus becomes, as M. Wickersheimer
        points out, a metaphysical person entering into antagonism with
        you. At bottom, mechanics, which seems to be the most precise of
        sciences, the one most foreign to metaphysics, is the one which
        contains most evident or hidden metaphysical notions. They
        evidently cover profound but entirely unknown causes. Perhaps we
        should explain the principle of equal reaction in the direction
        contrary to action by considering certain forces as couples --
        that is to say, as acting like a spring stretched between two
        points. It is evidently impossible then to act on one without
        the other reacting immediately. Gravity and electricity would
        come under this head. </p>
      <p><i>2. Mass</i> </p>
      <p>The mass which serves to characterize matter is only the
        measure of its inertia -- that is to say, of its resistance to
        movement. It is measured by seeking the magnitude of the force
        which must be opposed to inertia in order to annul it. Gravity
        has been chosen because it is easy to handle. We can by means of
        weights, each of which represents a certain quantity of
        attraction, measure the inertia of a certain portion of matter
        placed on one of the scales of a balance. </p>
      <p>The notion of mass was slow in establishing itself. Mach, in <i>his
History






          of Mechanics</i>, points out that Descartes, Newton and
        Leibnitz had only a very vague comprehension of it. Galileo
        confused mass with weight, which many people do even at the
        present time, although by reason of the units adopted, weight is
        represented by a figure about 10 times greater than that
        expressed by mass (1). </p>
      <p>[(1) The distinction between weight and mass, formerly
        considered synonymous, only became manifest when the observation
        of the pendulum revealed that the same body may receive a
        different acceleration of gravity in different parts of the
        globe. It was in 1871 that it was noted for the first time in
        astronomical observations that a clock giving the exact time in
        Paris no longer did so in Guiana. To render its pace regular, it
        is necessary to shorten the length of the regulating pendulum.]
      </p>
      <p>The term mass is, moreover, employed at the present day in two
        different senses. For physicists mass is a coefficient of
        inertia, and for astronomers a coefficient of attraction. If the
        attraction due to gravity were the same all over the globe, the
        mass of a body, that is to say, the quantity of inertia it
        possesses -- would be measured according to the force of
        attraction necessary to annul it. Chemists, who have only to
        compare the masses of bodies, proceed in no other way. For the
        calculations of mechanics it was necessary to find another
        element, because gravity alters with latitude and the height
        from the earth. This last variation even shows itself at the
        different stories of a house. </p>
      <p>The weight of a body varies from one place to another, but the
        acceleration which this body may take undergoes the same
        variation. The ratio of these two magnitudes is therefore
        constant at all points of the globe. It is this relation P/g
        which always figures in the calculations of mechanics. Given the
        value of the number g, it follows that in numerical expressions
        the mass of a body hardly represents the tenth part of its
        weight. The equation M = P/g which defines mass, refers to the
        gravity; but as the weight may be replaced by any force F, which
        produces an acceleration A, we obtain as a general expression of
        mass M = F/A. This is the fundamental equation of mechanics. One
        must not look too closely into its meaning. </p>
      <p>Mass has been considered as an invariable magnitude down to the
        recent researches mentioned in my last book. These last have
        shown that not only does the mass vary by the dissociation of
        atoms, but, further, that the products of this dissociation have
        a mass varying with their velocity. This mass can even increase
        to the point of becoming infinite -- that is to say, when the
        velocity approached that of light. Nothing proves, moreover,
        that it would not be the same with ordinary matter animated by a
        like velocity. </p>
      <p>Not only does the mass vary with the velocity, but it has
        lately become a question whether it does not also vary with the
        temperature. The question has not yet been elucidated. However
        that may be, mass is not at all that invariable magnitude which
        chemistry and mechanics formerly supposed it to be. The element
        which science considered as the immovable pivot of phenomena,
        the starting point to which it endeavored to refer all things,
        has become a variable magnitude of which the apparent fixity was
        only due to the imperfection of our means of observation. </p>
      <p>The inertia of matter is still, however, the most stable thing
        in the changing ocean of phenomena. This stability is not
        absolute, but as regards our ordinary requirements the inertia
        of matter can be considered as one of the great constants of the
        universe. </p>
      <p><i>3. Movement and Force</i> </p>
      <p>For half a century science thought she had discovered a second
        constant element in the universe. This element is energy, of
        which forces would be simple manifestations. </p>
      <p>We will now examine only the fundamental elements of forces.
        They are knowable to us by the movements they produce, and that
        is why, in the classic mechanics, force is simply defined as a
        cause of movement. </p>
      <p>By virtue of their inertia alone, bodies would only assume a
        uniform and rectilinear movement. Directly this movement is
        accelerated, we recognize that a force has intervened. It is
        solely this acceleration which mechanics measures and which
        figures in its equations. </p>
      <p>Force is therefore only known to mechanics through movement.
        Movement is not an irreducible magnitude, since it is derived
        from the four great elements of the universe -- time, space,
        matter and force -- which alone enable it to be defined. </p>
      <p>We have seen previously how by associating force and space the
        unit of mechanical energy and of work has been constituted; we
        shall see in a later chapter the transformations which the
        modern notion of the conservation of energy has introduced into
        the conceptions of force. </p>
      <p>What precedes shows us how notions of movement and of
        resistance are derived from those of force and mass, on which
        the principles of mechanics were built up. The equation F = MA
        defines force by the acceleration imparted to a body endowed
        with resistance to movement. </p>
      <p>To sum up, movement -- that is to say, change -- and inertia --
        that is to say, resistance to change -- constitute the
        fundamental elements accessible to mechanics. We will now see
        how, by associating them, this science has sought to interpret
        the phenomena of the universe. </p>

        <b><font size="+1">The Building Up of Forces and the Mechanical
            Explanations of the Universe</font></b></center>
      <p><i>1. The Cycle of Forces</i> </p>
      <p>We have just seen that on reducing to their essential elements
        the forces of the universe there still remain resistance and
        movement. Resistance is represented by the inertia of matter or
        of the ether, and movement by the displacement of these
        substances in space and time. </p>
      <p>The magnitude of forces is determined by the velocity of
        movements that they produce, their form by the nature of these
        movements. The movements of matter are only apparent to us when
        it comes into contact with an antagonistic factor which annuls
        or diminishes its velocity. The earth, for instance, by reason
        of its movements of rotation and of translation in space,
        possesses an immense kinetic energy; but it is not noticed,
        because out globe meets no obstacles in its path. Yet its
        kinetic energy would be sufficient, perhaps, to reduce to vapor
        any planet it chanced to strike. All things living on the
        surface of our globe are carried along with it in its movement,
        and possess in consequence a considerable kinetic energy. This
        would appear if they were suddenly transported from on point on
        the globe’s surface to another endowed with a different
        velocity; for instance, from the pole to the equator. On
        arriving at the equator they would be hurled into space with a
        speed more than six times that of a railway train. </p>
      <p>Independently of the movements of translation in a straight
        line like that of a cannon ball, or of rotation like that of the
        stars, matter and ether may show very different forms of
        movement. There result from this forces very different in
        aspect. We observe notably vibratory movements like those of a
        tuning fork, and circular disturbances such as those produced by
        casting a stone into the water, etc. Light and heat show exactly
        these last forms of movement. It is not only the kind of
        movements, but also the variations in velocity which condition
        the nature of forces. The recent theories on electricity put
        this last point well in evidence. They show, in fact, that
        forces differing from each other so widely as magnetism, the
        electric current, and light are generated by simple variations
        in the movements of electric particles. </p>
      <p>An electrified body in repose produces effects of attraction
        and repulsion only, and possesses no magnetic property. Set it
        in motion, and it is immediately surrounded by magnetic lines of
        force, and produces all the effects of a current like that which
        traverses telegraph wires. Let us vary by a sudden acceleration
        the speed of the particles, and they immediately radiate through
        the ether. Hertzian waves, calorific waves, and lastly light.
        These forms of energy, although so different in kind, only
        appear therefore as the consequence of simple changes of
        movement. </p>
      <p>The forces of nature probably contain other elements than
        movement. These elements do not affect our reagents, and we are
        therefore not cognizant of them. In the ocean of phenomena,
        science can only pick out what is accessible to it. </p>
      <p><i>2. The Mechanical Explanations of the Universe</i> </p>
      <p>That which precedes makes us feel in advance how fragmentary,
        and consequently how insufficient, must be the final explanation
        of phenomena which the science of mechanics proposes. </p>
      <p>Naturally this conclusion is not the one arrived at by the
        defenders of the doctrine which claims to explain everything by
        means of the equations of movement. In no way stopped by the
        excessive simplicity of their concepts, persuaded that all
        phenomena were wrapped up in their formulas, they have known
        neither mistrust nor uncertainty, and have imagined that they
        had for all eternity built up an edifice of imposing grandeur. </p>
      <p>For the majority of scholars, this sublime confidence still
        endures. One of the most eminent among them, Cornu, the
        Academician, at the Congres de Physique in 1900, delivered
        himself as follows: -- </p>
      <p>"The spirit of Descartes soars over modern physics. What am I
        saying? He is its shining light! The more we penetrate into the
        knowledge of natural phenomena, the more developed and precise
        is the audacious Cartesian conception of the mechanism of the
        universe. There is in the physical world only matter and
        movement". </p>
      <p>At the very moment these words were uttered, the classic
        edifice was furrowed by deep chasms. While the mathematicians
        were drawing up formulas, the physicists were making
        experiments, and these experiments fitted in less and less with
        the formulas. These discrepancies, however, did not greatly
        trouble the mathematicians. So soon as the equations no longer
        agreed with the experiments, they rectified the equations by
        imagining the intervention of "hidden movements" which
        completely baffled observation. The process was evidently
        ingenious, but evidently also a little childish. "Since", says
        M. Duhem, "no condition, no restriction, is imposed on these
        hidden movements, on what should we found the proof that a given
        difference may not find in them its raison d’etre?". </p>
      <p>Notwithstanding such subterfuges, the insufficiency of the
        classical mechanics has every day become more manifest with the
        progress of physics. "There exists", writes the author I have
        just quoted, "a radical incompatibility between the mechanics of
        Lagrange", that is to say, the classical mechanics, "and the
        laws of physics; this incompatibility attacks not only the laws
        of these phenomena in which the reduction to movement is the
        object of hypothesis, but also the laws which govern perceptible
        movements". </p>
      <p>It is not wholly in the great questions relating to the
        synthesis of the universe that the classical mechanics has shown
        itself very insufficient, but also in apparently much more
        modest problems like the theory of gases. It is by invoking the
        calculation of probabilities, by imagining a kind of statistics
        that it arrives at establishing extraordinarily complicated and
        also extraordinarily uncertain equations which elude all
        verification. </p>
      <p>Professors who continue to teach the formulas of mechanics
        renounce more and more their belief in them. This fictitious
        universe, reduced to the points to which forces are applied,
        seems to them very chimerical. "There is not a single one of the
        principles of rational mechanics which is applicable to
        realities", recently wrote to me one of the scholars who have
        most deeply sounded the problems of mechanics, the eminent Prof.
        Dwelshauwers Dery. </p>
      <p>In fact, mechanics has fallen into a state of anarchy from
        which it does not seem likely to emerge, notwithstanding the
        numerous attempts made to transform it. At the present time
        there exist three very different systems of mechanics: -- </p>
      <p>1. The classical mechanics, built up on the concepts of mass,
        force, space and time. </p>
      <p>2. The mechanics of Hertz, which discards the notion of force
        and replaces it by hidden links, supposed to exist between
        bodies. </p>
      <p>3. The energetic mechanics, founded on the principles of the
        conservation of energy, which we shall study later on. In this,
        matter and force disappear. There is not in the universe any
        other fundamental element but energy. This element is
        indestructible, while unceasingly changing its aspect. The
        various phenomena only represent mutations of energy. </p>
      <p>We might, however, vary mechanical systems to infinity by
        replacing the concepts of time, space, and mass by arbitrary
        magnitudes and expressing phenomena as functions of these new
        magnitudes. This is sometimes done by introducing into the
        equations, instead of the coordinates of the classical
        mechanics, the physical magnitudes such as pressure, volume,
        temperature, electric charge, etc., which determine the state of
        the body. From the principles derived from the study of the
        dissociation of matter cited in a previous chapter, there might
        be deduced a new mechanics in which matter would figure as the
        source of the various forces of the universe. We should write in
        the equations that such and such a force is simply matter minus
        something, that inertia is a consequence of the relations of
        equilibrium between intra-atomic energy and the ether, etc. We
        should thus link force to matter, and we should express the
        former as a function of the latter conformably with the
        teachings of experiment. </p>
      <p>But the moment has not arrived to translate into equations
        magnitudes of which the relations are not yet fixed. It is not
        very probable that this new mechanics would explain much better
        than the old one the mysteries of the universe. </p>
      <p>The fact that we only perceive in the universe matter and
        movement does not authorize us to maintain that it is not
        composed of anything else. We can only say that by reason of the
        insufficiency of our senses and of our instruments we only
        perceive that which presents itself in the form of matter and
        movement. Twenty years ago, we might strictly have said that
        there was nothing else. But the very unforeseen phenomena
        revealed by the study of the dissociation of matter have proved
        that the universe is full of formidable powers hitherto
        unexpected, and has shown the existence of immense territories
        completely unexplored. The edifice built by science which has so
        long sheltered our uncertainty now appears like a fragile
        shelter, of which the entire foundations have to be set up anew.

              Theory of the Conservation of Energy</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p><i>1. The Conservation of Energy</i> </p>
      <p>The various forces of the universe were considered by the old
        physicists as different from, and as exhibiting no connection
        with each other. Heat, electricity, light, etc., seemed
        unrelated phenomena. </p>
      <p>The ideas which sprang up during the second half of the last
        century differ much from this. After having settled that the
        disappearance of one force was always followed by the appearance
        of another, it was soon recognized that they all depended on the
        transformation of one indestructible entity -- energy. Like
        matter it might change its form, but the quantity of it in the
        universe remained invariable. The various forces, light, heat,
        etc., were only different manifestations of energy. </p>
      <p>The idea that forces might be indestructible is of fairly
        recent origin. The dogma of the conservation of energy only
        boasts, in fact, about half a century of existence. Up to the
        date of its discovery, science only possessed one permanent
        element -- matter. For the last 60 years it has possessed, or
        has thought it possessed, a second -- energy. </p>
      <p>The principle of the conservation of energy presents itself in
        a form so imposing and so simple, and answers so completely to
        certain tendencies of the mind, that one would suppose that it
        must have attracted keen attention the very day it was
        promulgated. Quite other was its fate. For 10 years not a single
        scholar in the world could be found who would even consent to
        discuss it. In vain did its immortal author, Dr Mayer of
        Heilbronn, multiply his memoirs (1) and his experiments. Mayer
        died of despair and so unknown that when Helmholtz repeated the
        same discovery a few years later, taking as a basis only
        mathematical considerations, he did not even suspect the
        existence of his predecessor. The critical mind is so rare a
        gift that the most profound ideas and the most convincing
        experiments exercise no influence so long as they are not
        adopted by scholars enjoying the prestige of official authority.
      </p>
      <p>[(1) The first paper of Mayer, "Remarks on the Forces of
        Inanimate Nature", was published in 1842. His last, "Remarks on
        the Mechanical Equivalent of Heat" was published in 1851.] </p>
      <p>Nevertheless, it always happens in the long run that a new idea
        finds a champion in some scholar possessing this prestige, and
        then it rapidly makes its way. As soon as the grandeur of the
        idea of the conservation of energy was understood by one such,
        it had an immediate success. </p>
      <p>It was especially the discussion of W. Thomson (Later Lord
        Kelvin) and the experiments of Joule, confirming the results of
        Mayer on the equivalence of heat and work, which attracted the
        attention of specialists. The whole army of laborers of science
        then pounced upon this subject, and in a few years the unity and
        the equivalence of physical forces came to be proclaimed, though
        on rather narrow grounds. </p>
      <p>This generalization proceeded from experiments which in reality
        did not include it. It was, in fact, deduced from the researches
        made to determine the rise in temperature produced by the fall
        of a weight to a given height into a liquid. It was noted that
        in order to raise by 1 degree the temperature of a kilogram of
        water it was necessary to let drop from a height of one meter a
        weight of 425 kilograms. This number 425 was called the
        mechanical equivalent of heat. </p>
      <p>In this experiment and other similar ones we simply establish
        that the different forms of energy can be transformed into
        mechanical work; but nothing indicates any relationship between
        them. We can, by making a machine to turn by human arms, steam,
        the wind, electricity, etc., produce the same amount of work,
        although its causes are perceptibly different. To speak of the
        mechanical equivalent of heat only signifies that with 425
        kilograms falling from a height of one meter we raise the
        temperature of water by 1 degree. In reality, heat or any form
        of energy is equivalent to work rather as a piece of 20 sous is
        equivalent to the pound of beef one can buy with it. </p>
      <p>Since the part of science is much more to measure things than
        to define them, the acquisition of a unit of measure always
        realizes for it an immense progress. Thanks to the creation of a
        unit of energy or work, we have succeeded in stating exactly
        notions which were formerly very vague. When, by means of any
        form of energy, it is possible to produce a determined number of
        calories or of kilogram-meters, our minds are made up as to its
        magnitude. Practically it is always by means of the heat they
        produce, measured by the elevation of the temperature of the
        water of a calorimeter, that most chemical, electrical, and
        other forces are calculated. </p>
      <p>To the principle of the conservation of energy others have been
        successively added which have allowed the laws of distribution
        to be clearly established. Applied at first solely to heat --
        that is to say, to that branch of physics called thermodynamics
        -- they were soon extended to all forms of energy. Thus was
        founded a particular science, Energetic Mechanics, which we will
        briefly examine later on. </p>
      <p><i>2. The Principles of Thermodynamics</i> </p>
      <p>Thermodynamics and energetic mechanics which is only the
        extension of the first named, rest on the three principles (1)
        of the conservation of energy, (2) of its distribution, or the
        principle of Carnot, and (3) of the law of least action. </p>
      <p>The first, already indicated above, is formulated as follows:
        The quantity of energy contained in the universe is invariable.
      </p>
      <p>Generalizing a little less confidently at the present time, we
        limit ourselves to saying that, in an isolated system, the sum
        of the visible energy and of the potential energy is constant.
        In this form the principle evidently remains unassailable,
        because the potential energy not being always available, we can
        always attribute to it the value necessary to satisfy the
        required ratio. </p>
      <p>The second principle of thermodynamics, or principle of Carnot,
        although it has become very complicated from the introduction
        into it of very different things in a purely mathematical form,
        is nevertheless completely contained in the following
        enunciation given by Clausius: Heat cannot pass from a cold body
        to a hot without work. This is now generalized thus: The
        transport of energy can only be effected by a fall in tension.
        This signifies that energy always goes from the point where the
        tension is highest to that where it is lowest. The importance of
        the principle of Carnot dwells in this generalization. It is
        applicable not only to heat but to all known modes of energy --
        calorific, thermal, electrical, or otherwise. </p>
      <p>This passage of energy from the point where its tension is
        highest to that where it is lowest is perfectly comparable to
        the flowing of a liquid contained in a vessel communicating by a
        tube with another vessel placed at a lower level. It may equally
        be compared to the flowing of the water of a river into the sea.
      </p>
      <p>Heat foes from a heated to a cold body, and never from a cold
        to a heated body, by a law analogous to that which compels
        rivers to flow down to the sea and prevents them from flowing
        back to their source. To say that rivers flow down to the sea
        and do not retrace their course is a simple translation of the
        principle of Carnot. </p>
      <p>Expressed in this way, it appears as a self-evident fact.
        Carnot put it into almost as simple a form, and yet physicists
        took nearly 25 years to grasp its full bearing. His
        genius-inspired idea was just to compare a fall of great heat to
        a fall of water, and all subsequent progress has consisted in
        recognizing that the various forms of energy, electricity in
        particular, obey, in their distribution, the laws which regulate
        the flow of liquids. Let us see, however, exactly what Carnot
        wrote: -- </p>
      <p>"The production of motive power is due, in steam engines, not
        to an actual consumption of calorific, but of its transport from
        a heated body to a cool body -- that is to say, to the
        restoration of its equilibrium which is supposed to be broken by
        one cause or another, by a chemical reaction such as combustion
        or by some other... The motive power of heat may be compared to
        that of a fall of water. Both have a maximum that cannot be
        passed, and this irrespective of the machine employed to receive
        the action of the water and the substance used to receive the
        action of the heat. The motive power of a fall of water depends
        on the height and the quantity of the liquid; the motive power
        of heat depends likewise on the quantity of calorific used,
        which we will call the height of its fall -- that is to say, the
        difference of temperature of the bodies between which is
        effected the exchange of calorific". </p>
      <p>Carnot was not an experimenter. His brief memoir is based on
        simple arguments, and can, in its essence, be brought down to
        the short passage I have quoted. And yet, by the sole fact of
        his principle being understood, the theoretical and practical
        science of the last century was entirely overturned. No
        physicist or chemist now enunciates a new proposition without
        first verifying whether it is in contradiction to the principle
        of Carnot. It might be said that never did so simple an idea
        have such profound consequences. It will forever serve to show
        the preponderant role of directing ideas in scientific
        revolution, and also how slow is the acquisition of the most
        simple generalization. </p>
      <p>The second principle of thermodynamics has, in reality, much
        greater importance than the first. Of which, moreover, it is
        almost independent. Even if energy were not preserved, its
        distribution would always take place, at least in the immense
        majority of cases, in accordance with the principle of Carnot. </p>
      <p>The generality of this principle permits it to be extended to
        all the phenomena in the universe. It regulates their march, and
        forbids them to be reversible -- that is to say, it condemns
        them always to take the same direction, and consequently not to
        go backwards up the course of time. If some magic power greater
        than that of the demons of the mathematician Maxwell were to
        compel the molecular edifices to pass again into their former
        condition, it would slowly lead the world backward, and oblige
        it to retreat up the course of ages, and would thus force its
        inhabitants to assume successively the earlier forms in which
        they appeared during the chain of geological periods. </p>
      <p>The principle of Carnot was completed by that called the
        principle of least action, or principle of Hamilton, which shows
        us the road which is follows by molecules constrained by
        superior force to transport themselves from one point to
        another. He tells us that these molecules can only take one
        direction, viz. the one which requires the least effort. This
        again is one of those principles of very great simplicity and
        yet immensely far-reaching. Reverting to the form given above to
        the principle of Carnot, that rivers descend to the sea and do
        not go back along their course, we may add that, by reason of
        the principle of least effort, rivers flow to the sea by the way
        which demands the least effort for the flow of water -- that is
        to say, by the greatest slope. </p>

        <b><font size="+1">The Energetical Explanation of Phenomena</font></b></center>
      <p><i>1. The Principles of Energetic Mechanics</i> </p>
      <p>It is one of the principles of thermodynamics, just briefly set
        forth, that the science of energetic mechanics, which claims to
        replace the classical mechanics, has been founded. </p>
      <p>Energetic mechanics occupies itself solely with the measurement
        of phenomena, and never with their interpretation. Nothing
        inaccessible to calculation exists. Eliminating matter and
        force, it studies nothing but the transformations of energy, and
        only knows phenomena from their energetic actions. It measures
        quantities of heat, magnetic fields, differences of potential,
        etc., and confines itself to establishing the mathematical
        relations between these magnitudes. </p>
      <p>A few brief indication will suffice to show how, in this
        theory, the forces of the universe are conceived. The energetic
        theory is rather a method than a doctrine. Still it has
        introduced into science certain important conceptions which I
        will briefly state. </p>
      <p>In energetic mechanics, energy is considered under two forms --
        the kinetic and the potential. The first represents energy in
        movement, the second energy at rest, but capable of acting when
        the repose ceases. Such, for instance, is the force of a coiled
        spring, of the weight of a wound-up clock, etc. </p>
      <p>The potential and kinetic energy of a system may vary
        inversely, but their sum remains constant within the system.
        Kinetic energy depends on the position of the molecules and
        their velocities, and is proportioned to the square of these
        velocities. Potential energy&nbsp; depends solely on the
        position of the molecules. The principle of least action,
        explained above, permits the equations of movement to be
        established when the kinetic and potential energies are known. </p>
      <p><i>2. The Quantity of Energy and Its Tension</i> </p>
      <p>Bringing precision into certain notions which are rather
        confused in the old mechanics, the energetic theory has shown
        that the energy of a body, whatever be the natural force to
        which it is related, is the product of two factors, the one
        tension or intensity, the other quantity. Tension regulates the
        direction of the transport of energy. According to the forms of
        energy, it is represented by a velocity, a pressure, a
        temperature, a height, an electromotive force, etc. By returning
        to the comparison of a force with the flow of a liquid which
        served Carnot to explain his principle, it is easy to understand
        the part played by these two factors -- quantity and tension. In
        a reservoir, quantity is represented by the mass of the liquid,
        tension by its height above the orifices through which it
        escapes. </p>
      <p>All forms of energy being known only by the work they produce,
        and there being nothing to differentiate the work of the various
        forces -- electrical, mechanical, thermal, etc. -- it follows
        that they can all be expressed by the same unit of work, viz.
        the kilogram-meter. For the sake of convenience others are
        sometimes used, but they can always be reduced to
        kilogram-meters. It is thus, for instance, that the joule used
        in electricity as the unit of work represents about one-tenth of
        the kilogram-meter. In the language of modern physicists, energy
        has become synonymous with work reckoned in kilogram-meters. </p>
      <p>The two factors quantity and tension are magnitudes to which we
        can give no other definitions that their measurement. In
        gravity, the quantity is represented by kilograms, the tension
        by the number of meters in the height of the drop. Their product
        represents the gravitic energy. In electricity, the quantity is
        represented by the output of the source in coulombs, the tension
        by the electric pressure in volts. In kinetic energy the
        quantity is represented by the mass and the tension by the
        velocity, etc. </p>
      <p>In a general way, therefore, if we designate by E the energy
        expressed in units of work, by Q the quantity, and by T the
        tension, we have E = Q x T. It follows that Q = E/T. The
        quantity is therefore represented by the energy divided by the
        tension. (1) </p>
      <p>[(1) In thermal energy the name of entropy is generally given
        to the quotient Q/T, in which Q represents the thermal energy
        and T the absolute temperature. This is expressed in a more
        general way by the integral M/T. When a certain quantity of
        thermal energy passes from a heated to a cold body, its entropy
        diminishes, and that of the cold body increases. The entropy can
        be varied without changing the temperature. It is therefore a
        variable which under certain conditions may change in an
        independent manner. </p>
      <p>Out of this notion of entropy certain physicists seem desirous
        of making a special physical magnitude which can be generalized
        in the different forms of energy. We have seen that by the
        artifice of expressing the most varied forms of energy in work
        measured by kilogram-meters all energies are made equivalent,
        which allows them to be added up arithmetically. But there is no
        basis of equivalence for the factors of which they are composed.
        It is therefore not possible to add up the entropies of the
        different energies of a body to obtain one single total entropy.
        It is easy to see that the factors of the different energies
        express things very different in reality. In thermal energy, for
        example, the factor tension is represented by a temperature; in
        kinetic energy by a velocity; in gravitic energy by a height,
        etc. </p>
      <p>One can be sure that a notion is obscure when it is understood
        in very different ways by the scholars who make use of it.
        Poincare regards entropy as "a prodigiously abstract concept",
        and it must be singularly so for the most celebrated physicists
        to comprehend it in such different fashions. This can be
        gathered from a long discussion published in the English
        journals <i>Nature, The Electrical Review,</i> and <i>The
          Electrician</i>, for 1900 and 1901. Eminent physicists
        published therein the most contradictory opinions, and seemed,
        moreover, astonished at their reciprocal ignorance of each
        other’s ideas. To engineers, the concept of entropy is a very
        simple matter calculable in figures because they have only
        applied it to the case of steam engines. To them the entropy of
        a body simply represents the variation (estimable in calories)
        of its thermal energy available for external work by degree of
        temperature and by kilogram of matter when heat is neither added
        nor taken away from it. The difficulties relative to entropy are
        derived from the impossibility of defining in what the different
        forms of energy consist. So far as electricity and heat, for
        instance, are concerned, one may remark with M. Lucien Poincare,
        "that it is impossible to establish a connection translatable
        into exact numerical ratios between a quantity of heat which is
        equivalent to a quantity of energy and a quantity of electricity
        which must be multiplied by a certain potential to express a
        certain quantity of work".] </p>
      <p>One finds indeed things which seem analogous in the different
        forms of energy, but these analogies are often very superficial.
        In electricity the resistance almost corresponds to mass in
        kinetic energy, but to what does it correspond in thermal
        energy? Is it the heat necessary to change the state of a body
        without modifying its temperature, and to simply conquer the
        resistance of the molecules to change? On these important points
        the textbooks are silent. However that may be, in all forms of
        energy these two elements, quantity and tension, of which the
        product represents the work, are always found. Without tension
        there could be no transmission of energy. It is especially in
        electricity that the difference between the two factors quantity
        and tension is clearly seen. The static machines in our
        laboratories yield electricity under a very high tension since
        it may reach as high as 50,000 volts; but their output is
        insignificant, since it never amounts to more than a few
        thousandths of an ampere. A galvanic battery, on the contrary,
        has a high yield in amperes, while the electricity issues from
        it at a very feeble tension hardly exceeding two volts. </p>
      <p>The old electricians, who knew not these distinctions, thought
        very erroneously that the static machines in our laboratories
        were, by reason of the loud sparks they produced, powerful
        generators of electricity. The tension is enormous, but the
        quantity infinitesimal, so that the product of these two
        magnitudes represents an insignificant amount of work. It is for
        this reason that the sparks from these noisy machines produce
        insignificant results, while with industrial machines where the
        tension hardly exceeds 100 volts or so, but which give a high
        output, the physiological, calorific, and luminescent effects
        are considerable. </p>
      <p>In the study of heat, the difference between the two magnitudes
        tension and quantity can likewise be clearly shown. Tension is
        represented by the temperature of a body, quantity by the number
        of calories it can produce. A very simple example will show the
        difference between the two factors. </p>
      <p>Let us burn a match of fir-wood or a whole forest of the same
        tree, and the thermometer thrust into the flame of the match or
        into that of the forest will indicate the same temperature. It
        is evident, however, that the quantity of heat generated in the
        two cases will be far different. With the heat produced by the
        combustion of the match we can only bring a few drops of water
        to boiling point, while with the quantity of heat resulting from
        the combustion of the forest, we could boil several tons of the
        same liquid. </p>
      <p><i>3. Transformation of Quantity into Tension, and Conversely</i>
      </p>
      <p>The product of the quantity by the tension -- that is to say,
        the work -- is a constant magnitude; but it is possible, without
        altering that product, to increase one of the factors and to
        diminish the other. These are operation to which commerce has
        recourse daily. </p>
      <p>The hydraulic analogies given above -- and to which we should
        always turn if we wish to thoroughly understand the distribution
        of energy -- enable us to conceive how quantity can be
        transformed into tension, or conversely, without varying their
        total product. As regard a reservoir of liquid, for example, we
        can see that without varying the weight of the liquid and by
        simply modifying the height and width of the receptacle, we can
        obtain at will a very great output with very feeble pressure,
        or, on the other hand, a very small output with a very great
        pressure. </p>
      <p>The transformation of quantity into tension, and conversely, is
        inconstant use in electricity. With a battery having a tension
        of only a few volts, but an output in amperes fairly great, it
        is possible, by passing the current through an induction coil,
        to bring the electricity to a tension of more than 20,000 volts,
        while greatly reducing its output. The converse operation may
        likewise be effected. In certain industrial installations we
        succeed in producing electricity under a tension of 100,000
        volts, and then this tension, much too great to be of practical
        use, is transformed so as to obtain a great output at a feeble
        voltage. In all these operation, the product of the quantity by
        the tension -- that is to say, of the coulombs by the volts --
        remains invariable. </p>
      <p>Judging by their effects, we might believe that quantity and
        tension constitute two very different elements. They are in
        reality but two forms of the same thing. The transformation of
        quantity into tension results simply from the mode of
        distribution of the same energy. The converse operation will
        transform, on the contrary, tension into quantity. A coulomb
        spread over a sphere of 10,000 kilometers radius will give only
        a pressure of one volt. Let us spread the same quantity of
        electricity over a sphere of a diameter 100,000 times less --
        that is to say, of 100 meters, and this same quantity of
        electricity will produce a potential a hundred thousand times
        higher -- that is to say, a pressure of 100,000 volts. </p>
      <p>It would be the same for any other form of energy -- for
        instance, light. If we possess a pencil of light, lighting
        feebly a surface of given extent, and wish to increase the light
        of a part of this surface, we have only to concentrate the
        pencil on a small space by means of a lens. The intensity of the
        part lighted will be considerably increased, but the illuminated
        surface will be notably reduced. By the same operation, we might
        increase the temperature produced by a pencil of radiant heat to
        the melting point of a metal. By a converse operation -- that is
        to say, by dispersing a pencil of radiations by a prism or
        diverging lens -- we increase the surface lighted or warmed, but
        reduce the intensity by the unit of surface. None of the above
        operations has varied the quantity of energy expended. Its
        distribution alone has altered. </p>
      <p><i>4. The Part of Matter in Energetic Mechanics</i> </p>
      <p>In the above summary, we have had recourse to the principles of
        energetic mechanics especially. As a method of calculation they
        are above criticism, but we must not try to get from them an
        attempt at the explanation of phenomena. Moreover, the energetic
        theory utterly rejects such explanations. Confining its role to
        the measure of magnitudes subsequently connected together by
        equations, it denies the existence of force, ignores matter, and
        replaces them both by a single entity -- energy, the varieties
        of which it limits itself to measuring. </p>
      <p>"But then, it will be said", writes on of the defenders of the
        doctrine (Prof Ostwald), "if we have to give up atoms and
        mechanics, what image of reality will remain to us? But we need
        no image and no symbol. The task of science is to establish the
        relations between realities -- that is to say, tangible and
        measurable magnitudes -- in such fashion that, some being given,
        the others are deduced from them... Hereafter there is no need
        to trouble ourselves about forces of which we cannot demonstrate
        the existence, acting between atoms of which we are not
        cognizant, but only to concern ourselves with the quantities of
        energy brought into play in the phenomena under study. These we
        can measure... All the equations which link together two or more
        phenomena of different species are necessarily equations between
        quantities of energy. There cannot be any other, for, besides
        time and space, energy is the only magnitude which is common to
        all orders of phenomena". </p>
      <p>Nor did the classical mechanics bring matter into its
        equations, since it only dealt with its effects, but it did not
        deny its existence. Energetic mechanics, which finds it simpler
        to ignore it than to seek to explain it, will never lead to any
        very high philosophical conception. Science would hardly have
        progresses if it had declined to try to understand what at first
        seemed above its reach. Tendencies of the same nature formerly
        existed in zoology, at the time when it was purely descriptive,
        and refused to deal with the origin of beings and their
        transformation. So long as such ideas prevailed, that science
        made but trifling progress; but if this narrow conception had
        not reigned for a long enough period, philosophical minds like
        Lamarck’s and Darwin’s would not have found the materials for
        their synthesis. It would be impossible to multiply too
        extensively the number of specialists whose lives are spent in
        weighing or measuring something. From time to time an architect
        appears who raises an edifice with materials which have been
        patiently brought together by sleepless workmen. The disciples
        of energetic mechanics are today accumulating documents of this
        kind against the day when superior minds will appear who will
        make good use of them. </p>
      <p>In treating matter as a negligible quantity, energetic
        mechanics has only taken on its shoulder a metaphysical
        inheritance centuries old. For a long time it was one of the
        regular recreations of philosophers to prove that matter and
        even the universe did not exist, and to expatiate at length on
        these negations. These inoffensive speculations lose all
        interest as soon as one enters a laboratory. We are then indeed
        compelled to act as if matter were a very real thing with which
        the universe was built, and which is in consequence the
        substratum of phenomena. We there have to distinguish very
        clearly also the matter which can be weighted, and the different
        forms of energy -- light, heat, etc. -- which cannot be weighed,
        and are consequently added to bodies without increasing their
        weight. </p>
      <p>Notwithstanding therefore all the equations of energetics, the
        great duality between matter and energy continued to exist.
        Matter might be eliminated from calculations, but this
        elimination did not make it vanish from reality. </p>
      <p>The readers of my last work know how I endeavored to make this
        classical dichotomy vanish by showing that matter was nothing
        else than energy in a form which had acquired fixity. We have
        taken from it none of the special properties which allow is to
        affirm its existence as matter, but have simply shown that it
        constitutes a form of energy capable of transforming itself into
        other forms, and that it is, through its dissociation, the
        origin of most of the forces of the universe, notably solar heat
        and electricity. Far, then, from deciding on its non-existence,
        we have been led to consider it as the principal element of
        things. </p>

        <b><font size="+1">The Degradation of Energy and Potential
            Energy</font></b></center>
      <p><i>1. The Theory of the Degradation of Energy</i> </p>
      <p>The dogma of the indestructibility of energy no longer rests on
        very safe arguments, but it is supported by some very strong
        beliefs which put it above discussion. Very scarce are the
        scholars who, following the example of the illustrious
        mathematician Henri Poincare, have discovered its weakness and
        pointed out its uncertainties. </p>
      <p>From the time of the earliest researches into the relations of
        heat and work, it was recognized that if it were possible to
        transform a given quantity of work into heat, we possess no
        means of effecting the converse operation without loss. The best
        steam engines do not transform into work much more than one
        tenth of the heat expended. Observation indeed shows that the
        disappearance of any form of energy is always followed by the
        apparition of a different energy; but this evolution is
        accompanied by a degradation of the original energy, which
        becomes less utilizable. The sole exception is perhaps gravitic
        energy. </p>
      <p>The indestructibility of energy did not, then, imply its
        invulnerability. There would have to be several qualities of
        energy, of which heat would be the lowest. The different
        energies having an invincible tendency to transform themselves
        into this low form of energy, it followed that all those in the
        universe would finally undergo this transformation. As
        differences of temperature equalize themselves by diffusion, and
        as heat is only utilizable as energy on condition of its being
        able to act on bodies of lower temperature, it follows that when
        all particles of matter contain energy at the same low degree of
        tension, no exchange could take place between them. This would
        be the end of out universe. From a highly differentiated state,
        it would have passed gradually to a non-differentiated state.
        Its energy would not be destroyed, since by definition it is
        supposed to be immortal. It would become simply unusable, and
        would remain unutilized until the day when our world would meet
        with another at a lower level of energy, with which it would in
        consequence exchange something. In the theory which we shall now
        deduce from our researches, things would have a little
        differently. </p>
      <p><i>2. Potential Energy</i> </p>
      <p>The concept of potential energy is only the extension of facts
        of elementary observation. I have already said that in the
        theory of conservation of energy this latter presents itself in
        two forms, kinetic energy or energy of movement and potential
        energy. In an isolated system these two forms of energy may vary
        in opposite directions, but their sum remains constant. If
        therefore we call the kinetic energy of a system C, and the
        potential energy P, we obtain C + P&nbsp; = constant. </p>
      <p>Evidently nothing is simpler and the classic example of the
        weight of the wound-ip clock well illustrates this apparent
        simplicity. So long as the weight does not act, the kinetic
        energy employed in winding it up remains stored up in the
        potential state. So soon as the weight commences to descend,
        this potential energy passes into the kinetic state, and at any
        moment of its course the sum of the kinetic energy expended and
        that of the potential energy not yet used is equal to the total
        energy primarily employed to raise the weight. </p>
      <p>In such elementary cases as this, there is no difficulty in
        distinguishing the kinetic from the potential energy; but once
        we go beyond these very simple examples, it becomes possible, as
        Poincare has shown, to separate the two forms of energy, and
        consequently to ascertain the total energy (chemical,
        electrical, etc) of a system. The formulas end by including such
        heterogeneous things, that energy can no longer be defined. </p>
      <p>"If we wish", he says in <i>La Science et l’Hypothese</i>, "to
        enunciate the principle of the conservation of energy in all its
        generality, and to apply it to the universe, we see it, so to
        speak, vanish, and there remains but this -- there is something
        which remains constant. But is there even any sense in this?". </p>
      <p>Very fortunately for the progress of science, when the
        consequences of the principle of conservation of energy were
        developed, its champions did not look so closely into the
        matter. Disdaining objections, they established a principle
        which has rendered immense services by the researches of which
        it was the origin. What it has especially shown is that the work
        expended to produce a certain effect -- a new chemical
        equilibrium, for instance -- is not lost, but is recovered when
        the body returns to its primitive state. It is nearly thus,
        moreover, that the principle of the conservation of energy is
        now regarded. It brings us back, then, to saying that the work
        yielded by a spring when released is equal to the power absorbed
        in compressing it. And we thus stumble once more on one of those
        truths of commonplace obviousness which often form the web of
        the greatest scientific principles. </p>
      <p>However this may be, the faculty which physicists have
        arrogated to themselves of considering the energy which appears
        to be lost as having passed into its potential state, will
        always remove the principle of the conservation of energy from
        experimental criticism. Latent potential energy plays the part
        of those "hidden forces" by the intervention of which the early
        mechanics succeeded in fitting into its equations the
        experiments which escaped them. The moment conservation of
        energy is admitted as a postulate, we must suppose that that
        which appears lost is to be found somewhere else, and the abyss
        of potential energy provides it with an inviolable shelter. But
        if we start from the contrary postulate, that energy can be used
        and lost, we are compelled to acknowledge that the second
        postulate would have in its favor at least as many facts as the
        first. </p>
      <p>These are, moreover, barren discussions, since experiment is
        incapable of throwing light on this question. We had, therefore,
        to retain the principle of the conservation of energy until,
        after having penetrated further into the intra-atomic universe,
        it had benn clearly set forth in what way energy becomes lost.
        This is a point of which the solution can be dimly seen, and I
        will presently examine it. </p>
      <p>It would be equally useless to dwell on facts which agree very
        badly or not at all with the principle of the permanence of
        energy, since it is enough to imagine any hypothesis whatever to
        make them fit in with this principle. Thus a way of explaining
        how the mass of a body can immensely increase with its velocity,
        as has been proven by experiments with radioactive particles,
        will certainly be found. It has indeed been explained how a
        permanent magnet may be for an indefinite space of time
        traversed by currents without its becoming heated by the
        friction, which would lead to the loss of its magnetism. It was
        enough to suppose that either it had no resistance -- that is to
        say, to confer on it a property that the non-instantaneous
        nature of the propagation of light proves not to exist. </p>
      <p>These unverifiable hypotheses have always allowed a theory to
        be saved so long as it is a fertile one. Many hypotheses in
        physics, such as that of the kinetic theory of gases, would
        probably quickly vanish if the experiment could throw light on
        them. These molecules unceasingly bustling against each other
        with the velocity of a cannon ball, without becoming heated,
        thanks to an elasticity supposed to be infinite, having perhaps
        but a very remote resemblance to the reality. The theory is
        rightly retained because it is a fruitful one, and because no
        possible experiment enables us to prove its inaccuracy. </p>
      <p>We have seen how the theory of the degradation of energy and
        its transformation into inaccessible potential energy allows us
        to withdraw the principle of the conservation of energy from the
        criticism of experiment. This theory has satisfied the immense
        majority of physicists, but not all. We know what Poincare
        thinks of it. He is not the only one to have stated doubts.
        Quite recently, M. Sabatier, Dean of the Faculty of Sciences at
        Montpellier, propounded in an interesting inaugural lecture with
        the title "Is the Material Universe Eternal?", the question
        whether it was quite certain that there was not a real and
        progressive loss of energy in the world; and more recently
        still, in a memoir on the degradation of energy, one of our most
        far-seeing physicists, M. Bernard Brunhas, expressed himself as
        follows: -- </p>
      <p>"What is our warrant for the statement that the universe is a
        limited system? If it be not so, what signify these expressions:
        ‘the total energy of the universe’, or the utilizable energy of
        the universe? To say that the total energy is preserved but that
        the utilizable energy diminishes, is this not formulating
        meaningless propositions? </p>
      <p>"It would not be absurd to imagine a universe where, after the
        example of our solar system, the total internal energy might go
        on diminishing while the fraction remaining would constantly
        pass into an unusable form, where energy would be lost and at
        the same time degraded. </p>
      <p>"The law of the conservation of energy is only a definition:
        the proof of this is that when a new phenomenon comes to
        establish a discord in the equation of energy, there is set up
        for it a new form of energy defined by the conditions of
        reestablishing the compromised inequality". </p>
      <p>And in answer to a letter in which I set forth my ideas on this
        point, the same physicist wrote to me: -- </p>
      <p>"The ‘nothing is lost’ should be deleted from the exposition of
        the laws of physics, for the science of today teaches us that
        something is lost. It is certainly in the direction of the
        leakage, of the wearing away of the worlds, and not in the
        direction of their greater stability, that the science of
        tomorrow will modify the reigning ideas". </p>
      <p>I have faithfully set forth, in this and the preceding
        chapters, the theories which rule science at present. My
        criticisms have not interfered with the faithfulness of my
        exposition. Their object was simply to show that the current
        theories contain some very weak points, and that consequently it
        is permissible to replace them, or at least to prepare for their
        replacement. No longer fettered by the weight of early
        principles now sufficiently shaken, we can proceed to examine
        whether, in place of being indestructible, energy does not
        vanish without return, like that matter of which it is only the
        transformation. </p>

      <p><i>1. The Transformations of Energy</i> </p>
      <p>No one at the present day is unaware -- and the first savages
        who succeeded in obtaining fire by rubbing together two bits of
        wood might have suspected the fact -- that with a given form of
        energy other forms may be produced. Yet the theory of the
        equivalence of forces and their transformations was only clearly
        formulated at the date of the discoveries relating to the
        conservation of energy. </p>
      <p>The most elementary textbooks now teach that all the forces of
        nature are interchangeably transformable, and are only
        transformations of a single entity, viz.: energy. </p>
      <p>In his work on <i>The Evolution of Physics</i>, Poincare has
        summed up the existing ideas as follows: -- </p>
      <p>"The physicists of the end of the 19th century were brought to
        consider that in all physical phenomena there occur apparitions
        and disappearances which are balanced by various energies. It is
        natural, however, to suppose that these equivalent apparitions
        and disappearances corresponding to transformations, and not to
        simultaneous creations and destructions. We thus represent
        energy to ourselves as taking different forms -- mechanical,
        electric, calorific, and chemical -- capable of changing one
        into the other, but in such a way that the quantitative value
        always remains the same". </p>
      <p>It is easy to comprehend the origin of this theory, but when we
        go deeper into it we discover neither the necessity nor the
        exactness of it. All that can be said in its favor is, that it
        escapes the test of experiment. It is certain that the various
        forms of energy appear to transform themselves, or better, that
        from any form of energy others can be produced. But these are
        merely apparent transformations like the turning of money into
        goods. For a 5-franc piece we obtain a meter of silk; but nobody
        thinks that the silver of which the coin is made transforms
        itself into silk. Yet a like transformation is admitted when we
        are assured that the friction of a rod of resin with a strip of
        flannel has been turned into heat and electricity. The modern
        theory of the equivalence and the transformation of energies
        seems indeed to be only an illusion arising from the fact that
        in order to measure them, we have chosen the same unit, viz.,
        that of work estimated in kilogram-meters or in calories. </p>
      <p>Under its most dissimilar forms, energy is simply defined as
        equivalent to a certain amount of mechanical work, and to the
        modern physicist energy and work have always been synonymous,
        although they are in reality very distinct things. We should
        have a very poor idea f the comparative value of a horse, a
        Negro, and a white man, if we confined ourselves to measuring
        the number of kilogram-meters that each could produce. Little
        can be known of things from simply measuring one of their
        quantitative elements. We must indeed be satisfied with such
        indications when others cannot be obtained; but in that case we
        must resign ourselves to acknowledging the insufficiency of our
        knowledge. </p>
      <p>Movement, electricity, heat, etc., being evidently very
        different things, its seems natural to say that the different
        forms of energy are too dissimilar to be transformed one into
        another, but that the same effect may come from different
        causes. A motor is set in movement by various agents such as
        steam, electricity, manual labor, or wind, which are not akin to
        each other, although they produce identical effects. When
        movement or any kind of force produces heat, does this signify
        anything else than that with dissimilar means we obtain the
        variations of molecular equilibrium from which heat results? A
        transmutation such as that of movement into electricity or light
        would assuredly be more marvelous than that of simple bodies --
        of, for instance, lead into gold. </p>
      <p>I will not dwell further on this theory, which is little in
        conformity with the teachings of the present day. I should even
        have judged it useless to formulate it if chance had not brought
        before my eyes a memoir by Prof Ostwald, who arrives by other
        roads at the same conclusion as myself. These are his words:-- </p>
      <p>"As is well known, we distinguish since Hamilton’s time two
        kinds of physical magnitudes -- scalars and vectors. These two
        kinds of magnitudes are essentially different in their nature,
        and the one can never be represented by the other. I am
        persuaded that there exist a greater number of magnitudes of
        different kinds, and I believe I am justified in admitting that
        the different forms of energy are all characterized by
        magnitudes possessing such an individuality. Let this be
        confirmed, and the fact that up to the present mechanics has
        been unable to give a complete image of nature will appear as a
        necessity. Such a notion would be as precious for science as
        was, in its time, the notion of the individuality of chemical
        elements, and the modern adepts of mechanical theories, by
        claiming to reduce all forms of energy to mechanical energy,
        would no more have done useful work than did the alchemists who
        sought to turn lead into gold. That, in the course of such
        labor, all kinds of discoveries, as interesting as they were
        unexpected were made, is only one likeness the more to the often
        fertile activity of these obstinate gold-seekers". </p>
      <p><i>2. Under What Forms Energy Can Exist in Matter</i> </p>
      <p>I have already examined this question in my last work, and I
        arrived at the conclusion that the energies manifested by matter
        are the consequences of the movements of its elements. It must
        be thanks to their rapidity that matter contains a very great
        quantity of energy in a very small volume. It is known that the
        liberation of one gram of hydrogen in the decomposition of water
        corresponds to a production of electricity equal to 96,000
        coulombs -- say, an output of nearly 27 amperes an hour. </p>
      <p>It does not appear that chemists consider in this light the
        manifestations of energy of which matter may be the seat. While
        careful to affirm that energy is in no way anything material,
        they treat it exactly as if it were a kind of fluid absorbed and
        restored by bodies as a sponge imbibes a liquid and gives it out
        when being squeezed. They constantly speak, in fact, of heat
        being absorbed or given out by a combination, and all
        thermochemistry is founded on the measurement of these
        absorptions and liberations. In reality, bodies in their
        transformation absorb nothing at all. When we are told that a
        body absorbs heat to transform itself, this simply signifies
        that in order to compel its elements to modify their equilibria
        they have had to expend energy. This energy will be restored on
        their return to their primary equilibria, just as a spring
        produces when released an amount of work, equal to that expended
        in its compression. </p>
      <p>This image of a spring, rude as it may be, makes us clearly
        understand that the absorptions or liberations of heat by
        chemical compounds during their transformation are only
        displacements of energy following on changes of equilibrium. It
        will be easily recognized that a spring on its release produces
        a power equal to that expended to set it. It is to this
        elementary fact that the whole science of thermochemistry and
        also the principle of the conservation of energy may be
        referred. Carbon, the combustion of which -- that is to say, its
        combination with oxygen -- generates a quantity of heat, offers
        us the type of those bodies supposed to be capable of absorbing
        energy and then of retaining it. Chemists tell us with regard to
        coal that "the heat of combustion represents stored-up solar
        energy". It would seem that the coal has stored heat as a
        reservoir stores water. </p>
      <p>In reality, it has stored nothing during its formation; but,
        being a body with a strong affinity for the oxygen of the air,
        and producing, when in combination with it, equilibria which are
        accompanied by a great liberation of heat, we utilize this last
        to produce water-vapor, the elastic force of which sets in
        motion the pistons of our steam engines. If the air, instead of
        oxygen, had contained only nitrogen, coal would never have been
        considered as a storehouse of energy. It does not, in reality,
        contain it any more than a crowd of other bodies more abundant
        in nature, such as aluminum and magnesium. These metals, if not
        already engaged in certain combinations, would produce, by
        uniting with oxygen, heat as utilizable as that generated by the
        oxidation of carbon. </p>
      <p>The reader who bears in mind my theory of intra-atomic energy,
        according to which all atoms are a colossal reservoir of energy,
        will no doubt object that, apart from any combination, any body
        whatever is thus a reservoir of forces. But these forces have
        not been utilized up to the present. Only molecular and not
        intra-atomic reactions are recognized by chemistry and commerce.
        They were thus the only ones we had to deal with in the
        preceding remarks. </p>

        <b><font size="+1">The Changes of Equilibria of Matter and of
            the Ether as the Origin of Forces</font></b></center>
      <p><i>1. Alterations of Level as Generators of Energy</i> </p>
      <p>Physicists measure forces and energy, but do not define them.
        For them force is simply the cause of a movement, and they
        evaluate its magnitude by the acceleration it produces. When a
        force displaces its point of application over a certain length,
        it gives a determined amount of work. This mechanical work being
        the unit with which all forms of energy are measured, the effect
        has finally become confused with the cause, and for many
        physicists work and energy have become, as has been said,
        synonymous. Forces form part of the irreducible elements of the
        universe. Not being, like time and space, comparable to
        anything, we cannot define them. We shall here only attempt to
        put in evidence a general condition of their manifestation. </p>
      <p>All the forces of nature are generated by disturbances of
        equilibrium in either the ether or matter, and disappear when
        the disturbed equilibria are restored. Light, for instance,
        which is born with the vibrations of the ether, ceases with
        them. </p>
      <p>Two bodies charged with heat, electricity, movement, etc.,
        cannot, whatever be the difference of magnitude of these bodies,
        act on each other and produce energy, save when the elements
        with which they are charged are out of equilibrium. From this
        defect of equilibrium results what is called tension, or, again,
        potential. In heat, tension is represented by the difference of
        temperature; in electricity, by the electromotive force; in
        energy of movement, by the velocity; in gravity, by the drop,
        etc. </p>
      <p>This break of equilibrium excites a sort of flow of energy. It
        takes place from the point where the tension is highest towards
        that where it is lowest, and continues till the equilibrium is
        reestablished -- that is to say, until there is an equality of
        level between the two bodies in question. We may therefore
        consider as generators of energy a liquid passing from a higher
        to a lower level; heat passing from a hot to a cold body;
        electricity flowing from a body with a high potential to one
        with a low potential; movement transmitted from a body animated
        by velocity to another with less velocity, etc. Thus energy
        depends on the state of the bodies in presence. There is only an
        exchange between them if they are out of equilibrium -- that is
        to say, if they possess different tensions. One of the bodies
        present then loses something which it yields to the other until
        their tensions are equalized. In order that they may then
        generate a new quantity of energy, they must be put in presence
        of a third body, which is out of equilibrium with them. </p>
      <p>Generally speaking, that which substances yield up to each
        other during these exchanges are forms of movement. All the
        modes of energy are known and measured by these movements. </p>
      <p>According to the media in which the disturbances of equilibrium
        manifest themselves, and according to their form, they are
        termed heat, electricity, light, etc. </p>
      <p>The disturbances of equilibrium which generate forces are
        themselves the consequence of other disturbances. They follow,
        by substituting themselves for, on another, which is why a force
        only appears at the expense of another force, which is at the
        same time annulled. </p>
      <p>Taking these facts as starting point, we could formulate in the
        following way the principle of the conservation of energy. In a
        closed system and equilibrium cannot be destroyed without being
        replaced by another equivalent form of equilibrium. These things
        happen as if all the elements of the universe were related to
        each other in such a way as to constitute a sort of articulate
        system. Nothing, however, indicates that the universe is a
        closed system, and the fact that energy is always degraded when
        transformed -- that is to say, becomes less and less utilizable
        -- seems to show that the springs of our supposed articulate
        system cannot work without losing something. </p>
      <p>This essential notion of the disturbance of equilibrium as the
        origin of energy may be put in evidence by a few examples. Let
        us place on the same level two receptacles full of water and
        connected by a tube. Being in equilibrium they cannot produce
        any energy. Raise one of the receptacles above the other, and
        the equilibrium of their contents is at once disturbed, and part
        of the liquid flows from the higher to the lower receptacle
        until the equilibrium is again established. During this
        interruption, and only while it lasts, will the water be able to
        do work -- to lift a piston, for example. </p>
      <p>It is exactly the same with heat, electricity, or any other
        energy. Two bodies heated to the same temperature represent two
        reservoirs on the same level, or two equal weights on the
        scale-pans of a balance, and there results from this no
        manifestation of energy. If, on the contrary, the temperature of
        one of the bodies is lower than that of the other, there will be
        a disturbance of equilibrium and a production of energy until
        the two bodies arrive at the same calorific level. </p>
      <p>It is the same with electricity. There can be no production of
        electrical energy without an interruption of equilibrium.
        Whatever the quantity of electricity with which we charge a
        body, it will produce no energy if it be in relation with
        another at the same potential -- that is to say, at the same
        electrical level. </p>
      <p>Our instruments of measurement -- thermometers, galvanometers,
        manometers, etc., simply indicate energetic differences of
        level, to which we give the names of temperature, pressure,
        voltage, etc., existing between some source of energy and an
        arbitrary zero taken as point of reference. If the bulb of a
        thermometer were at the temperature of the source to be measured
        -- that is to say, in equilibrium with it -- it is evident that
        the column of mercury would remain motionless. What a voltmeter
        measures is likewise the difference of level between a source of
        electricity and itself. Our instruments, like our senses, are
        only sensitive to differences. </p>
      <p>Thus, then, without an alteration of level of the ether of
        matter there can be no possible manifestation of energy. If the
        sun possesses throughout its mass a uniform temperature of 6000
        degrees, and there could exist in it beings capable of
        supporting that heat, it would represent to them no energy.
        Having no cold bodies at their disposal, they could produce no
        fall of heat, a condition indispensable for the production of
        thermal energy. </p>
      <p>Let us now suppose that, instead of finding themselves at a
        uniform temperature of 6000 degrees, these imaginary beings live
        in a world of ice at the uniform temperature of zero, but
        possess in a corner of their world still colder an unlimited
        provision of liquid air. Contrary to those plunged in a medium
        at 6000 degrees, they would find in the blocks of ice around
        them a considerable source of energy. By plunging these latter,
        in fact, into the liquid air at 180 degrees, they would obtain a
        considerable alteration of temperature. At the contact of the
        ice, which is to liquid air a very hot body, this latter would
        immediately boil, and its vapor could be employed to put motors
        in operation. The inhabitants of that world would therefore
        replace the coal of our steam engine by blocks of ice, which
        they would consider, certainly with more reason than we do coal,
        reservoirs of energy. </p>
      <p>With this ice and this liquid air, it would be very easy for
        them to produce the highest temperatures. The tension of the
        vapor obtained could be employed, in fact, to drive dynamos, by
        means of which can be obtained electric currents capable of
        producing temperatures sufficient to fuse and volatilize all
        metals. </p>
      <p>That which has just been said concerning interruptions of
        equilibrium as the condition of the production of energy,
        applies to all its forms, including that possessed by bodies in
        motion. It can only be born from the encounter of bodies not
        having the same tension -- that is to say, the same velocity --
        and which cannot therefore be put in equilibrium. If the
        hunter’s bullet kills the animal flying before him, it is
        because the velocities of the two are different. If these were
        equal, the bullet would evidently have no effect. Equalities of
        velocity render manifestations of kinetic energy impossible. </p>
      <p>The locomotive, notwithstanding its mass, can do nothing to the
        fly which hovers in front of it at the same rate of speed. The
        effects of masses, endowed with kinetic energy, on the bodies
        they meet, result solely from the inertia of matter, which
        prevents its instantaneously adopting the velocity of the
        elements which act upon it. If bodies were not possessed of
        inertia -- that is to say, of resistance to movement -- they
        would simply take the velocity of the masses striking them, and
        would not be destroyed by them. </p>
      <p>Kinetic energy, therefore, on final analysis, represents
        movement which passes or tends to pass from one body to another.
        It is the same, moreover, with thermal energy. It manifests
        itself by molecular movements from a heated body to the elements
        of a cold body, the movements of which have less velocity. It is
        always movement which is transmitted in order to make itself
        equal with another movement, and to be in equilibrium with it. </p>
      <p>Into the disturbances of equilibrium which I have invoked in
        order to explain the origin of energy, the notion of quantity
        has not entered. The quantity of heat, electricity, movement, or
        gravity possessed by the bodies put in motion matters little.
        They will only act on each other if the movement, the
        electricity, or the heat, with which they are charged, have
        different tensions. Whether one or one hundred kilograms are
        placed in the two pans of a balance, it will remain motionless
        as long as there is no difference between the two weights. All
        the manifestations of energy are subject to the same law. Bodies
        in the presence of each other can, I repeat, only yield
        something to one another if they are at different tensions. </p>
      <p>Differences of tension -- that is to say, of equilibrium-- are
        the first condition of all productions of energy, but the
        magnitude of this energy results evidently from the masses
        brought into play by the differences of tension. It is evident
        that a weight of 100 kilograms falling from a height of 100
        meters will produce more energy than 1 kilogram falling from the
        same height. The magnitude of the energy is therefore
        necessarily represented by the product of two factors --
        quantity and tension. Tension represents a difference of level.
        Whether applied to very great or very small masses, it is the
        fundamental condition of the production of energy. </p>
      <p>We see, finally, that all the forms of energy are transitory
        effects resulting from the interruption of equilibrium between
        several magnitudes -- weight, heat, electricity, or velocity. It
        is therefore quite erroneous to speak of energy as a kind of
        entity having a real existence analogous to that of matter. The
        considerations just set forth allow is to imagine a world the
        physicists of which would accept the second principle of
        thermodynamics, but would reject the first -- that is to say,
        that of the conservation of energy. Let us suppose a universe
        with an invariable temperature where the sole source of energy
        known is that of the waterfalls coming from immense lakes
        situated on mountain tops, such as one sometimes meets with in
        different regions of the earth. The learned men of such a work
        would no doubt have discovered pretty quickly the possibility of
        converting into heat, light, and electricity the energy of these
        waterfalls, but they would also have established by experiment
        that they could not without enormous leakage restore the water
        to its original level with the forces produced by its own flow.
        They would thus be led to believe that energy is a thing which
        is used up and lost, and that the energy of their world would be
        exhausted when all the water of the lakes should have descended
        to the plains. </p>
      <p><i>2. Of What Elements the Entity Called Energy are Composed</i>
      </p>
      <p>It may be objected to the preceeding remarks, that it is not
        because a thing does not produce any effect that it does not
        exist. A weight held up by a thread is still a weight. Heat not
        in action is still heat; a force annulled by the action of
        another force does not on that account lose its existence. But
        when we reflect on the phenomena called heat, gravity,
        electricity, etc., we recognize that they are only known and
        measured as disturbances of equilibrium, and have, outside of
        these disturbances, no existence verifiable by our senses or
        instruments. Heat produces kinetic energy by its fall; but heat
        which does not change its level is no more energy than the tile
        fixed on a roof. No doubt the sun warms us, and there we see an
        energy which seems to be quite independent and to have an
        existence of its own. And yet all the energy produced results
        solely from a difference of temperature -- that is to say, of
        equilibrium -- between the caloric effects of the rays emitted
        by the star which warms us and the bodies which receive them.
        Let any body at the same heat as itself be brought as near as
        you please to the sun, and there will be no possible exchange of
        what we call caloric energy. </p>
      <p>Physicists argue, moreover, exactly as if they admitted all
        this. They are fully aware that there must be alterations of
        level to effect work, and that no work can be manifested when
        the alteration of level has ceased. But as it would be possible
        to produce a flow of energy with a fresh alteration of level,
        they assert that this energy which is not manifested exists in a
        potential state. </p>
      <p>All these concepts of potential energy, unusable energy,
        degraded energy, etc., are the consequences of a confusion of
        ideas, according to which energy is a sort of substance of which
        the existence is as real as that of matter. This invisible
        entity, the secret mover of things, is supposed to circulate
        unceasingly through the universe by constantly transforming
        itself. This hypothesis was, moreover, necessary when matter was
        believed to be an aggregate of inert elements only able to
        restore the energy it received, and incapable of creating any.
        Something was indeed necessary to animate it, and it was that
        something which constituted energy. </p>
      <p>If this mysterious entity was necessary for the epoch when a
        superior cause had to be imagined for the animation of inert
        matter, its existence has no object at the present day. Instead
        of imagining an unexplained power perpetually circulating
        through the world without ever being exhausted, I say: -- </p>
      <p>At the origin of things there was condensed in matter, under
        the form of movement of its elements, an enormous but yet
        limited quantity of energy. This phase of concentration was
        followed by a period of expenditure of the accumulated energies,
        on which the sun and analogous stars have now entered. The
        disintegration of their atoms is the origin of all the natural
        forces now utilized. These atoms form an immense reservoir, but
        one which must inevitably exhaust itself. Then that which we
        call energy will, like matter, have disappeared forever. </p>
      <p>By thus reasoning we only appeal to conceivable phenomena. Our
        explanation brings us to the brief enunciation of a limited
        provision of forces stored up in matter at the time of its
        formation, which produce, when this last disintegrates,
        different energies having only momentary existence. This is very
        simple, whereas the entity, supposed to be immortal, termed
        energy is completely incomprehensible. Science has not driven
        forth the gods from their ancient empire to replace them by
        metaphysical processes still more unintelligible than they. </p>

            Matter and of the Forces of the Universe ~</font></b></center>
      <p><i>1. The Origin of Matter</i> </p>
      <p>The origin of things and their end are the two great mysteries
        of the universe which have cost religions, philosophies, and
        science the most meditation and thought. As these mysteries
        appear unfathomable, many thinkers turn away from them. But the
        human mind has never resigned itself to ignorance. It invents
        chimeras when it is refused explanations, and these chimeras
        soon become its masters. </p>
      <p>Science has not yet lighted torches capable of illuminating the
        darkness which envelops our past and veils the future. It is
        able, however, to project some beams into this deep night. </p>
      <p>If everything proceeds from the ether and afterwards returns to
        it, we are forced to inquire first of all how a substance so
        immaterial can transform itself into heavy and rigid bodies,
        such as a rock or a block of metal. </p>
      <p>The ideas I have set forth on the structure of matter allow us
        in some degree to understand this and to deduce from them the
        following theory: -- </p>
      <p>Bodies are constituted by a collection of atoms, each composed
        of an aggregate of rotating particles, probably formed by
        vortices of ether. By reason of their velocity these particles
        possess an enormous kinetic energy. According to the way in
        which their equilibria are disturbed they generate different
        forces -- heat, light, electricity, etc. </p>
      <p>It is probable that matter owes its rigidity only to the
        rapidity of the rotary motion of its elements, and that if this
        movement stopped it would instantaneously vanish into ether
        without leaving a trace behind. Gaseous vortices, animated by a
        rapidity of rotation on the order of that of the cathode rays,
        would in all probability become as hard as steel. This
        experiment is not realizable, but we can imagine its results by
        noting the considerable rigidity which is acquired by a fluid
        animated by great velocity. </p>
      <p>Experiments made in hydroelectric factories have shown that a
        liquid column only 2 centimeters in diameter, falling through a
        tube of the height of 500 meters, cannot be broken into by a
        violent blow from a saber. The arm is stopped as if by a wall
        when it arrives at the surface of the liquid. Prof. Bernard
        Brunbes, who witnessed this experiment, is persuaded that if the
        velocity of the liquid column were sufficient a cannon ball
        would not go through it. A layer of water a few centimeters
        thick, animated by a sufficient velocity, would be as
        impenetrable to shells as the steel plates of an ironclad. </p>
      <p>Lat us give to the above column of water the form of a vortex
        ring, and we shall get an image of the particles of mater and
        the explanation of its rigidity. </p>
      <p>This enables us to understand how the immaterial ether, when
        transformed into small vortex-rings animated by sufficient
        velocity, may become very material. It will also be understood
        that, if these whirling movements were stopped, matter would
        instantaneously vanish by return to the ether. </p>
      <p>Matter, which seems to give us the image of stability and
        repose, only exists, then, by reason of the rapidity of the
        rotary movement of its particles. Matter is velocity, and, as a
        substance animated by velocity is also energy, matter may be
        considered a particular form of energy. </p>
      <p>Velocity being the fundamental condition of the existence of
        matter, we may say that this last is born so soon as the vortex
        rings of the ether have acquired, by reason of their increasing
        condensation, a rapidity sufficient to give them rigidity.
        Matter grows old when the speed of its elements slackens. It
        will cease to exist so soon as its particles lose their
        movement. </p>
      <p>We are therefore brought to this first essential notion:
        Particles of a substance, however minute we may imagine them to
        be, may, by the sole fact of their velocity, acquire a very
        great rigidity and become transformed into matter. Let us now
        examine how, with these two elements, particles of ether and
        velocity, it is possible to understand the genesis of a
        universe. </p>
      <p><i>2. The Formation of a Solar System</i> </p>
      <p>The fist scientific theory on the origin of the world was, as
        we know, formulated by Kant and developed by Laplace. According
        to this last, our solar system with its retinue of planets must
        be derived from a primal nebula similar to those observed in
        space. Agglomerated under the influence of gravitation, which
        would thus be the primitive force, it formed a central globe
        animated with a movement of rotation, whose particles by
        constant attraction have drawn closer and closer together. </p>
      <p>By reason of the increasing rapidity of its rotation, following
        on its condensation, this first nucleus of the sun became
        flattened, and at a certain moment there were detached from it
        by centrifugal force rings similar to those existing round
        Saturn. </p>
      <p>Continuing their movement of rotation, these rings finally,
        still under the influence of centrifugal force, broke into
        fragments. From these fragments, projected into space, were born
        the planets which revolve round the sun. Incandescent at first
        like this last, but cooling relatively quickly by reason of
        their small volume, they at length became inhabitable by living
        beings. </p>
      <p>Laplace stopped his investigation at the cooled planet, and did
        not busy himself wither with the elements which formed it nor
        with those which might enter into the constitution of other
        solar systems. </p>
      <p>It is now possible to go further, and to apply to atoms the
        laws which seem to have presided at the birth and formation of
        our universe. </p>
      <p>It is now admitted that atoms are formed of numerous particles
        revolving round one or several masses with a velocity of the
        order of light. The atom may therefore be compared to a sun
        surrounded by its retinue of planets. Its small size does not
        prevent such a comparison. In an immensity without limits
        extreme littleness does not sensibly differ from extreme
        greatness. Beings sufficiently small would consider the
        planetary system formed by the elements of an atom as important
        as are to us the gigantic stars of which astronomy observes the
        march. </p>
      <p>In the study of the evolution of worlds it is today easy to go,
        as has been said above, far beyond Laplace. No one could suspect
        in his time that spectrum analysis would make known the
        composition of the sun, and would reveal therein elements
        identical with those of our globe -- an evident proof that the
        terrestrial elements are derived from those of the sun. </p>
      <p>Spectrum analysis has, moreover, enabled us to follow the
        genesis of the elements which compose the various worlds. The
        variation of the spectra of the stars in the red and the
        ultraviolet regions indicates their temperature, and
        consequently their relative age; while the other spectral rays
        make known their composition. We have thus determined the bodies
        appearing in the stars with the variations of temperature
        corresponding to different phases of evolution. In the youngest
        stars -- that is to say, the hottest -- there hardly exists
        anything but a few gases, principally hydrogen; then, as these
        stars become cooler, there successively appear the simple bodies
        we know, beginning with those of the lowest atomic weight. </p>
      <p>Since astronomy has learnt to fix by photography the image of
        the stars, it has established that their number is much larger
        than it once thought. It now estimates at more than 400 millions
        the number of luminous stars, planets, and nebulae existing in
        the firmament, without speaking, naturally, of those that are
        invisible and consequently unknown. Spectrum analysis shows that
        they are at very different stages of evolution. Their past must
        be of fearful length, since geologists estimate the existence of
        our planet at several hundred million years. </p>
      <p>During these accumulations of ages unknown to history, the
        millions of stars with which space is peopled must have begun or
        ended cycles of evolution analogous to that now pursued by our
        globe. Worlds peopled like ours, covered with flourishing cities
        filled with the marvels of science and the arts, must have
        emerged from eternal night and returned thereto without leaving
        a trace behind them. The pale nebulae with shadowy forms
        represent perhaps the last vestiges of worlds about to vanish
        into nothingness or to become the nuclei of a new universe. </p>
      <p>How can the worlds undergo the phase of descending evolution
        succeeding that of ascending evolution briefly pointed out in
        this chapter? This we shall soon study. </p>
      <p>We will especially bear in mind from what has been said that
        the transformations revealed by observation of the stars point
        out the general march of the evolution of worlds. It is always
        enclosed in that fatal cycle of things -- birth, growth, decline
        and death. </p>
      <p>Whether it is the transformation of worlds or that of the
        beings living on their surface that is the question, slowness is
        always the law of evolution. In order to succeed in forming
        beings gifted with the small amount of intelligence possessed by
        man, nature has caused to evolve through thousands of centuries
        the animal forms which preceded him. Her transformations are
        only realized at the cost of very slow efforts. She cannot
        create a world in seven days like the god of early legends. If
        mighty divinities reign in some distant region, they are not
        sovereign divinities, for Time dominates them, and they can do
        nothing without him. </p>
      <p><i>3. Molecular and Intra-Atomic Energies</i> </p>
      <p>In order to avoid all confusion in what is to follow, we must
        first clearly separate molecular from intra-atomic energies.
        These are probably close relations between them. </p>
      <p>Molecular energies are the only ones hitherto known to science.
        They generate cohesion, affinity, and chemical combinations and
        decompositions. The manifestations of intra-atomic energy
        sometimes accompany them, as in the phenomena of incandescence,
        but they formerly escaped all investigation. </p>
      <p>It is solely to molecular energies that the laws of
        thermodynamics and of thermochemistry have been applied. They
        always come back to this: A material body can emit no energy but
        that which it has first received. </p>
      <p>The forces manifested in all chemical and industrial operations
        represent simply restitutions or displacements of energy; and it
        is conceived that, under such conditions, the quantity of this
        last remains invariable. These operations are identical with
        those effected by the introduction into reservoirs of various
        shapes of a certain quantity of water contained in another
        reservoir. This substitution naturally does not change the
        weight of the liquid. </p>
      <p>Science, then, has only examined those intra-molecular energies
        with which bodies can be charged. This study has led to matter
        being considered as entirely distinct from energy, and simply
        serving as its support. Matter, when heated or electrified,
        could indeed absorb energy; but it restored this borrowed energy
        afterwards, as a sponge does the water it has absorbed, without
        ever increasing its quantity. </p>
      <p>Matter being only the support of energy, we seemed perfectly
        justified in establishing a difference profound and, as it was
        thought, irreducible between matter and energy. </p>
      <p><i>4. Intra-Atomic Energy as the Source of the Forces of the
          Universe</i> </p>
      <p>The readers of my last work know how I sought to cause this
        great dichotomy to disappear by showing that matter, far from
        only being able to restore the energy borrowed by it from
        without, is, on the contrary, a colossal reservoir of forces. It
        is itself only a particular form of energy characterized by its
        relative fixity and its concentration in immense quantity but in
        small volume. The energy accumulated in 1 gram of any matter
        represents as much as about 3 billion kilograms of coal. I
        showed finally that this intra-atomic energy was the source of
        solar heat, of electricity, and of most of the forces of the
        universe. </p>
      <p>Intra-atomic energy is, moreover, very stable or the world
        would long ago have vanished. It is even so sable that chemists
        considered the aggregation of energy called matter to be
        absolutely indestructible. We have now learnt to dissociate
        matter, but only in extremely feeble quantities. It may,
        however, be hoped that the science of the future will find means
        to disaggregate it more thoroughly. It will then have at its
        disposal an immense source of forces. I have shown in my former
        work that by artificial means very stable bodies can be
        rendered&nbsp; -- surface for surface -- 40 times more
        radioactive than substances spontaneously dissociable, such as
        uranium. </p>
      <p>The study of intra-atomic energy, which is now only beginning,
        has enabled us to penetrate into an entirely new world where the
        ancient laws of chemistry and of physics are no longer
        applicable. One of the most important of these differences is
        the following: -- </p>
      <p>In handling intra-atomic energy we can only draw from an
        isolated material system a quantity of energy at the most equal
        and never superior to the amount primarily supplied to it. In
        the manifestations of intra-atomic energy, we observe just the
        contrary. Matter is able to liberate spontaneously large
        quantities of energy either without any aid from without, as is
        seen in highly radioactive bodies such as uranium and radium, or
        under such feeble influences as a ray of light. With a very
        minute quantity of energy we can therefore produce a very large
        quantity, which fact is contrary to principles formerly
        considered indestructible. </p>
      <p>When seeking, in my previous work, for the causes of solar heat
        and of the incandescence of the nocturnal stars, I showed that
        intra-atomic energy greater than that which exists on the cooled
        globes ought to suffice for the maintenance of these stars’
        temperature. Studying subsequently the properties of the
        emissions from the isolated poles of an electrical machine, I
        showed their identity with the products of dissociation of
        radioactive bodies. Electricity might, then, be considered as
        one of the manifestations of intra-atomic energy. And it is thus
        that its part in natural phenomena, so unsuspected a few years
        ago, appeared to me entirely preponderant. Our sun, in the phase
        of the world into which it has entered, only expends the
        energies accumulated by its atoms during an earlier phase of
        concentration. </p>
      <p>This dissociation of the provision of intra-atomic energy
        accumulated in matter at the commencement of things explains the
        origin of the forces of the universe. At those far-off epochs of
        the chaos of our solar system of which the nebulae show a
        confused image, the ether slowly condensed. The localized
        vortices of ether, forming probably the primitive elements of
        matter, accumulated by the increasing velocity of their rotation
        the intra-atomic energy of which we note the existence. To the
        phase of concentration succeeded, later on, a phase of
        dissociation. Our universe has entered upon a new cycle and the
        energy slowly accumulated in the atom has commenced to liberate
        itself by reason of its dissociation. The solar heat, whence is
        derived the greater part of the energies of which we make use,
        represents the most important manifestation of this
        dissociation. </p>
      <p>Although this provision of intra-atomic energy is immense, it
        is not infinite, and its emission, consequently, cannot last
        forever. The planets surrounding the stars have cooled because
        this energy is reduced. The sun itself must be subject to the
        same law. When its intra-atomic energy has been dissipated, it
        will cease to light the planets around it, and the earth will
        become uninhabitable, unless science discovers the means of
        easily liberating the immense quantity of intra-atomic energy
        still contained in matter. But even should its succeed in this,
        it will but retard the repose, since the provision of
        intra-atomic energy is limited. </p>
      <p>Thus, then, the sun, the generator of most of the terrestrial
        energies, only expends the forces slowly accumulated in matter
        at the epoch when within the primordial clouds of the ether the
        atoms stored up the energies they were one day to restore. </p>
      <p>How can this intra-atomic energy, the source of solar heat,
        electricity, and most of the forces of the universe, be
        dissociated and lost? We will new examine this point. </p>

        <b><font size="+1">The Vanishing of Energy and the End of Our
            Universe</font></b></center>
      <p><i>1. The Old Age of Energy and the Vanishing of Forces</i> </p>
      <p>We have just seen that intra-atomic energy is a limited
        magnitude, which is reduced day by day. How can it be lost?
        Having already treated this question in my last work, I will
        only summarize what I have already there explained. </p>
      <p>To say how matter finally vanishes is to explain how forces
        vanish, since matter is a special form of energy, only differing
        from others by its relative fixity and its very great
        concentration in a very feeble volume. </p>
      <p>I have shown that one of the most constant products of the
        dissociation of matter was the so-called particle of
        electricity, deprived, according to the last researches, of all
        material support, and considered as constituted solely by a
        vortex-ring of ether. </p>
      <p>The experiments previously described have shown that these
        particles emit lines of force, and are always accompanied in
        their various manifestations by those vibrations of the ether
        called Hertzian waves, radiant heat, visible light, invisible
        ultraviolet light, etc.. These vibrations represent for us the
        vanishing phase of the elements of the atom and the energies of
        which they are the seat. </p>
      <p>How can the vortex-rings of ether and the energies generated by
        them lose their individuality and vanish into the ether? The
        question reduces itself to this: How can a vortex formed in a
        fluid disappear into this fluid by causing vibrations in it? </p>
      <p>Stated in this form the solution of the problem is fairly
        simple. It can be easily seen, in fact, how a vortex generated
        at the expense of a liquid can, when its equilibrium is
        disturbed, vanish in spite of its theoretical rigidity by
        radiating away the energy it contains under the form of
        vibrations of the medium in which it is plunged. It is in this
        way, for instance, that a waterspout formed by a whirl of liquid
        loses its existence and disappears in the ocean. </p>
      <p>In the same manner, doubtless, the whirls of ether constituting
        the elements of atoms can transform themselves into vibration of
        the ether. These last represent the final stage of the
        dematerialization of matter and of its transformation into
        energy before its final disappearance. </p>
      <p>Thus, then, when the atoms have radiated all their energy in
        the form of luminous caloric, or other vibrations, they return,
        by the very fact of these radiations following on their
        dissociation, to the primitive ether whence they came. Matter
        and energy have returned to the nothingness of things, like the
        wave into the ocean. </p>
      <p>The defenders of the postulate of the conservation of energy
        will evidently answer to the above, that energy being, by the
        hypothesis, supposed to be indestructible, by vanishing into the
        ether is not lost, and remains in the potential state, drowned
        in its immensity. Thus regarded, the theory of the conservation
        of energy evidently represents nothing but an unverifiable
        conception, especially created by our desire to believe that
        there exists in the universe something immortal. Not wishing to
        consent to being only a flash in the infinite, we dream of a
        movement that shall last forever. </p>
      <p>But even if, in accordance with the preceding hypothesis,
        energy should continue to circulate in some form or other in
        space, yet, cast forth from the sphere of our universe, it would
        no longer forma part of it, and in one way or another the energy
        of the universe would have vanished. It is to this point, which
        is moreover fundamental, that we limit our demonstration. </p>
      <p>It does not seem at first sight very comprehensible that worlds
        which appear more and more stable as they cool could become so
        unstable as to afterwards dissociate entirely. To explain this
        phenomenon we will inquire whether astronomical observations do
        not allow us to witness this dissociation. </p>
      <p>We know that the stability of a body in motion, such as a top
        or a bicycle, ceases to be possible when its velocity of
        rotation descends below a certain limit. Once this limit is
        reached it loses its stability and falls to the ground. Prof
        J.J. Thomson even interprets radioactivity in this manner, and
        points out that when the speed of rotation of the elements
        composing the atoms descends below a certain limit they become
        unstable and tend to lose their equilibrium. There would result
        from this a commencement of dissociation with diminution of
        their potential energy, and a corresponding increase of their
        kinetic energy sufficient to launch into space the products of
        intra-atomic disintegration. </p>
      <p>It must not be forgotten that the atom being an enormous
        reservoir of energy is by this very fact comparable with
        explosive bodies. These last remain inert so long as their
        internal equilibria are not disturbed. So soon as some cause or
        other modifies these, they explode and smash everything around
        them after being themselves broken to pieces. </p>
      <p>Atoms therefore which grow old in consequence of the diminution
        of a part of their intra-atomic energy gradually lose their
        stability. A moment then arrives when this stability is so weak
        that the matter disappears by a sort of explosion more or less
        rapid. The bodies of the radium group offer an image of this
        phenomenon -- a rather faint image, however, because the atoms
        of this body have only reached a period of instability when the
        dissociation is rather slow. It probably precedes another and
        more rapid period of dissociation capable of producing their
        final explosion. Bodies such as radium, thorium, etc., represent
        no doubt a state of old age at which all bodies must arrive some
        day, and which they already begin to manifest in our universe,
        since all matter is slightly radioactive. It would suffice for
        the dissociation to be fairly general and fairly rapid for an
        explosion to occur in a world where it was manifested. </p>
      <p>These theoretical considerations find a solid support in the
        sudden appearances and disappearances of stars. The explosions
        of a world which produces them reveal to us, perhaps, how the
        universes perish when they become old. </p>
      <p>As astronomical observations show the relative ***&nbsp; these
        rapid destructions, we may ask ourselves whether the end of a
        universe by a sudden explosion after a long period of old age
        does not represent its most general ending. These abrupt
        annihilations manifest themselves as the sudden apparition in
        the heavens of an incandescent star, which pales and vanishes
        sometimes in a few days, leaving generally no trace behind it,
        or at most a faint nebula. </p>
      <p>When the new star first appears, its spectrum, at first
        analogous to that of the sun, proves that it contains metals
        similar to those of our solar system. Then, in a short time, the
        spectrum is transformed, and becomes finally that of the
        planetary nebulae -- that is, it only contains rays of a few
        simple elements, some of which are unknown. It is therefore
        evident that the atoms of the temporary star have been rapidly
        and profoundly transformed. This downward evolution is the
        converse of that indicated in the upward evolution of stars.
        These contain, when very hot, simple elements which become more
        and more complicated and numerous as they continue to cool. </p>
      <p>These transitory stars, resulting no doubt from the sudden
        explosion of a world accompanied by the disintegration of its
        atoms, are not rare. Hardly a year passes without some being
        observed either directly or by the study of photographic plates.
        One of the most remarkable was the one recently observed in the
        constellation of Perseus. In a few days it attained a brilliancy
        which made it the most brilliant star in the sky; but 24 hours
        later it began to pale, its spectrum was slowly transformed, and
        became, as said before, that of the planetary nebula -- an
        evident proof, I repeat, of atomic dissociation. At the very
        moment when this transformation was taking place, photographs of
        long exposure showed nebulous masses round the star, produced no
        doubt by atomic dissociation, which rapidly left it behind at a
        speed of the order of light -- that is to say, analogous to that
        of the Beta particles emitted by radioactive bodies when
        disintegrating. The astronomers were, then, enabled to be
        present at the rapid destruction of a world. </p>
      <p><i>2. Summary of the Doctrine of the vanishing of Forces and
          Discussion of Objections</i> </p>
      <p>The account of the general evolution of worlds to which this
        and the preceding chapter have been devoted, includes facts of
        experiment or of observation which I have endeavored to connect
        by hypotheses. I will sum up this account by a recapitulation
        showing the different phases of evolution of a system analogous
        to ours and to those which continue to be born and transformed
        in the firmament. </p>
      <p><i>3. The Periods of Evolution of a World</i> </p>
      <p>(1) Phase of Chaos or of the Birth of Energy -- Formation, by
        the action of gravitation or of unknown causes, of clouds and
        ether. Under their influence inequalities are established whence
        result differences of potential. The ether condenses into
        scattered particles which assume the form of vortex-rings.
        Animated at first by rather slow movements, they contain but
        very little energy. </p>
      <p>(2) Phase of Nebulae or of Concentration of Energy -- The
        whirls of ether accelerate their movements. Thence attractions
        result which agglomerate them into nuclei, the future germs of
        matter. A general concentration of the mass is established. A
        nebula is formed, vague at first in shape, which ends by
        becoming spherical, and will eventually be the origin of a solar
        system. In proportion as the particles of this mass condense,
        the ether-whirls precipitate their movements, agglomerate and
        form the nuclei of atoms which, by reason of the increasing
        rapidity of their rotation, become more and more saturated with
        energy. </p>
      <p>(3) Phase of Stellar Incandescence or of Expenditure of Energy
        -- This phase is that of the formation of a sun and analogous
        stars. By continuous condensation, the atoms have finally
        acquired a quantity of intra-atomic energy which they can no
        longer contain and therefore radiate in the form of heat, light,
        or various forms of electricity, of which heat is perhaps only a
        secondary manifestation. The temperature of the orb is
        excessive. The future atoms are not yet individualized. </p>
      <p>(4) Phase of the Commencement of Stellar Refrigeration and of
        the Individualization of Matter -- By reason of the continuity
        of its radiation, the temperature of the orb becomes lower,
        although it still remains incandescent. The elements of the
        atoms form new equilibria, and give birth to the various simple
        bodies which differentiate and multiply in proportion as the
        cooling of the star increases. </p>
      <p>(5) Phase of Planets, or of Refrigeration and of the
        Equilibrium of Intra-Atomic Energy -- The planets, detached by
        the centrifugal force of the central sun round which they
        continue to revolve, become cooler by reason of the relative
        smallness of their volume, and finally reach a temperature low
        enough for life to be possible on their surface. The energies
        accumulated in the form of matter have attained a phase of
        stable equilibrium. Fixity succeeds to mobility. The worlds are
        about to become inhabitable for long series of ages. </p>
      <p>(6) Phase of Final Dissociation of Intra-Atomic Energy and
        Return of the World to the Ether -- While maintaining themselves
        in equilibrium for long centuries, the atoms have not ceased to
        radiate slightly, and in consequence of this radiation and of
        the reduction of the speed of rotation of their elements which
        ensues, they lose some of their stability. Then commences a
        period of disaggregation, which increases very quickly in
        proportion as the stability of the intra-atomic elements
        decreases. Progressive at first, it afterwards becomes
        instantaneous; at a certain period of old age, the elements
        return to the ether whence they came. </p>
      <p>To this period of final destruction succeeds, perhaps, in the
        course of ages, a new cycle of birth and of evolution, without
        its being possible to assign a term to these destructions and
        recommencements, probably eternal (1). </p>
      <p>[(1) The above rather reminds one of the "retour eternal" of
        Nietzsche; it is an hypothesis, moreover, void of importance,
        which I formulated long before that author, as Prof.
        Lichtenberger recalls in a book devoted to the doctrines of the
        philosopher.] </p>
      <p>The above account, deduced from researches related in my
        preceding volume, may be summarized in a few lines. I borrow
        these from one of the scholars who have had the kindness to
        analyze my doctrine:-- </p>
      <p>"We imagine the world to be formed at first of diffuse atoms of
        ether which, under the action of unknown forces, have stored up
        energy. This energy, one of the forms of which is matter,
        dissociates and appears in various forms -- electricity, heat,
        etc., so as to bring matter back to ether. ‘Nothing is created’
        signifies that we cannot create matter. ‘Everything is lost’
        means that matter disappears entirely, as does matter by its
        return to the ether. The cycle is therefore complete. There are
        two phases in the history of the world: 1, Condensation of
        energy under the form of matter; 2, Expenditure of this energy".
      </p>
      <p>This conception of the concentration of energy at the origin of
        a world and of its expenditure in a subsequent phase of its
        existence has been disputed by a distinguished physicist, M.
        Bernard Brunhes, in a recent memoir. The following is the
        objection he makes to it: -- </p>
      <p>"The concentration of cosmic matter and the dissociation of
        matter are two phenomena which appeared opposed to each other,
        but which possess a common characteristic. Both liberate heat
        and correspond to a degradation of energy. Be therefore assured
        that if any radioactive body whatever has been produced which
        has stored up an enormous provision of reserve energy, it is by
        favor of a still greater degradation of energy... Matter which
        dissociates at the end of transformations which seem to bring it
        back to the starting point will have undergone a definite loss
        of utilizable energy". </p>
      <p>The above exception is supported by the principle of Carnot;
        but a principle applicable to the downward phase of evolution is
        not necessarily applicable to its earlier upward phase. </p>
      <p>The illustrious mathematician Maxwell had already shown by a
        much bolder hypothesis than mine -- since it implies the
        existence of very subtle demons -- how the principle of Carnot
        might be violated and the course of things retraced. We must
        wait till we are better acquainted with the laws of nature
        before supposing that she has not found out the means of
        bringing out of the gloomy void of the ether the forces
        condensed in the atom. If hypotheses analogous to mine are
        rejected, we must return to that of a creator drawing forth
        worlds from his will -- that is to say, from a nothing much more
        mysterious still than the substratum from which I have
        endeavored to raise them. The gods having been eliminated from
        nature, where our ignorance alone had placed them, we must try
        to explain things without them. Evidently since the dawn of
        geological times, phenomena seem to have always evolved in
        accordance with the second law of thermodynamics; but this law
        is, I repeat, one of the period of the wearing out of a universe
        and not of the ages during which the energies now expended were
        condensed -- since we must admit that our solar system has had a
        beginning like all the analogous systems of which astronomy has
        noted the evolution. It is likewise necessary to admit that a
        concentration of energy was first formed. N. Brunhes, moreover,
        himself recognizes this in a passage of his memoir, which
        constitutes the best answer I can make to him: -- </p>
      <p>"There is no inconsequence in imagining that the present period
        of degradation has been preceded and may be followed by periods
        in which the energy utilizable may increase instead of
        diminishing". </p>
      <p>It is, moreover, as the same author points out, at a similar
        conclusion that Boltzmann arrived in his great work on the
        theory of gases. The march of the world in the direction opposed
        to the present evolution no longer appears to him as an absolute
        impossibility, but simply as a very faint probability which may
        nevertheless have been realized during the succession of ages. </p>
      <p>It is to these brief and uncertain notions that all we can say
        regarding the evolution of the worlds in the infinite duration
        of time is reduced. We will now leave these mysterious regions
        to return to those in which experiments can serve as a guide.
        The study of the actions of light on a fragment of metal, which
        was the origin of my researches, led me into very different
        fields of physics. I will now conduct the reader into these, and
        examine a few new problems. </p>
      <p>As the general conclusion of this first part of my work, I
        shall formulate the following proposition: -- </p>
      <p>Energy is not indestructible. It is unceasingly consumed, and
        tends to vanish like the matter which represents one of its
        forms.</p>
