      A new, eco-friendly system for eradicating damp and drying out
      buildings that uses no chemicals, no drilling, no maintenance, no
      batteries or electricity is now available in the UK. The system is
      called Aquapol and the company offering this service is based in
      East Grinstead, West Sussex.<br>
      <br>
      Aquapol is a sensational new technology that ends rising damp
      problems and keeps properties dry for decades.<br>
      <br>
      “Aquapol has been installed over 32,000 times in properties
      throughout Europe since 1985. Some of the more illustrious
      building are the Hungarian Parliament in Budapest, Hungary; The
      Joseph Haydn Museum in Eisenstadt, Austria; the Greek Oriental
      Church in Vienna, Austria and many more,” says Volker Kubillus,
      Managing Director, Aquapol UK.<br>
      <br>
      “There are many beautiful and important old buildings here in the
      UK, loved the world over, and one of our purposes is to play our
      part in preserving them so they can be enjoyed by many generations
      to come.”<br>
      <br>
      Rising damp occurs where a damp proof course is broken or missing
      and so water molecules creep up the capillary system within the
      brick and stone work of the building, thus causing plaster to
      become damp and stained, and often to crack and come loose.
      Aquapol reverses the polarity of the water molecules and so causes
      them to flow downwards, leading, over a period of months or years,
      to gradual dehydration.<br>
      <br>
      Aquapol is the brainchild of Austrian engineer Wilhelm Mohorn who
      received the highest Austrian award for successful research and
      invention, the Kaplan Medal, in 1995. The name Aquapol comes from
      ‘aqua’, the Latin word for water, and ‘pol’, shortened from
      polarisation.<br>
      <br>
      Aquapol technology is based on long lost discoveries made by the
      Serbian scientific genius, Nikola Tesla (1856-1943) about the
      properties of water and naturally occurring energy fields within
      the earth and air. According to Wikipedia, Tesla was an inventor,
      physicist, mechanical engineer, and electrical engineer of
      profound genius. He is often regarded as one of the greatest
      scientists in the history of technology. In addition, Tesla is
      recognized among the most innovative engineers of the late 19th
      century and early 20th century. His patents and theoretical work
      form the basis of modern alternating current electric power (AC)
      systems, including the AC motor.<br>
      <br>
      In the United States, Tesla’s fame exceeded that of any other
      inventor or scientist in history and in popular culture. His name
      became a byword for innovation and practical achievement. He was
      deemed a "magician" who conjured up technical feats. After his
      demonstration of wireless communication in 1893 and after being
      the victor in the "War of Currents", he was widely respected as
      America’s greatest electrical engineer. Much of his early work
      pioneered modern electrical engineering and many of his
      discoveries were of groundbreaking importance.<br>
      <br>
      The service that Aquapol offers includes a free damp analysis and
      the preparation of a comprehensive report and damp eradication
      plan with details of work needed and costs. The dehydration is
      then achieved by the installation of a specific Aquapol device
      which must be located in exactly the right spot according to the
      findings of the analysis. An Aquapol device contains sophisticated
      equipment which brings about the reversed polarity of the water
      molecules in the walls. This device needs no electrical supply, no
      batteries, no chemicals and zero maintenance. Aquapol guarantees
      successful results.<br>

      In 1983 a system was developed in Austria, capable of <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">demoisturizing whole buildings
        without direct intervention to the masonry nor the use of
        chemicals</span>. It<span style="font-weight: bold;"> requires
        no conventional energy supply yet maintains the lowered moisture
        levels</span>. Throughout Europe there are more than 21 000
      successfull Aquapol installations, some of them in internationally
      famous locations such as the Budapest Parliament,&nbsp;
      Hungary;&nbsp; the Joseph Haydn Museum in Eisenstadt, Austria et
      al.<br>
      <br>
      Scholastic physics offered no explanation for the working
      principles. However Years later and through his own research the
      inventor, Wilhelm Mohorn, was able to find the functional
      foundations of this revolutionary technology, for which earned him
      an Austrian National Prize Award:&nbsp; the "Kaplan Medal".<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">1. The proto energy of the
        universe</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      The existence of a universal energy is the precondition to this
      successfull masonry draining technology. This proto-energy has
      lots of aliases, e.g. "vacuum field", "zero-point energy",
      "tachyon energy", "Free Energy", etc. It is assumed that it has
      been existent from the very beginning of the physical universe and
      possesses the following physical properties:<br>
      <br>
      present everywhere<br>
      massless<br>
      penetrates matter<br>
      no particular direction<br>
      high-frequency<br>
      faster than the speed of light<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fig.1: The proto-energy of the
        physical universe</span><br>
      <div style="text-align: center;"><br>
        <img alt="" src="fig1-proto.gif" height="210" width="255"><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      This proto energy is the direct carrier of several kinds of
      energy, as will be described later. Its energetic potential
      exceeds our imagination. In its pure form it is not bound to any
      other energy form. For this reason one could call it free energy.
      Hence, it cannot be measured directly. However, it can manifest
      itself through interactions with matter which may serve as a
      source for indirect observation.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">2. Manifestation of the proto
        energy by interactions with matter</span><br style="font-weight:
        bold;">
      <br>
      Obviously this energy does interact with matter. By these means it
      manifests itself and becomes sensible or measurable. Here matter
      can mean many things, celestial bodies, technical equipment, also
      life-forms etc. The various kinds of matter act as proto- energy
      converters. The bigger the more massive the body is and as
      stronger is the interaction, i.e. the more energy is converted.
      When proto-energy penetrates matter it is partially transformed
      into more or less familiar forms of energy, e.g. gravity, magnetic
      energy.<br>

        <br>
      </div>
      In Fig. 2 I tried to demonstrate symbolically how the different
      forms of energy, connected with matter, belong together and are
      related to each other. The lines connecting the individual kinds
      of energy with matter represent the mutual interactions.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">3.1 Scholastic physics</span><br>
      <br>
      At the 3 bottom vertices of the energy pyramid the known static
      forms of energy are shown. They are called static because the
      direction of the force they impose on matter does not change, for
      example magnetism: compass needle. The remaining 2 static forms of
      energy are gravity (an originally inexplicable phenomenon) and
      electrostatics. Between electrostatics and magnetism there is a
      dynamic form of energy which exhibits wave-character. Therefore,
      it is permanently changing the direction of its force. This is the
      well-known electromagnetism.<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br style="font-weight:
        bold;">
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">3.2 Extended physics</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Due to many inexplicable phenomena and my own intensive
      fundamental research there are 3 more physical spectra of energy
      missing, which are shown in the completed Fig. 3. One of them is
      electrogravity, which explains all those physical effects where
      electricity influences gravity. The flying technology of UFOs may
      be explicable with this, and the famous Bielefeld–Brown effect is
      also related to this energy spectrum.<br>
      <br>
      In order to explain the function of the Aquapol technology the
      other two energy spectra do have special significance, which are
      gravomagnetism (very similar to electromagnetism) and, last but
      not least, the proto-energy of the universe. Apparently the 3
      static and 3 dynamic forms of energy are in balance with each
      other. The cosmic proto-energy is superior to all other energy
      forms. That is why it is placed at the top of the energy pyramid.
      Finally, matter draws a direct connection between the proto-energy
      and the 3 static and 3 dynamic forms of energy.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fig.3&nbsp; The cosmic energy
        pyramid with its interconnected energy spectra</span><br

      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">4. Examples for the emergence of
        the various energy forms (= spectra)</span><br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">4.1 Gravity</span><br>
      <br>
      As many "Free Energy researchers" before me have already claimed,
      gravity is a product of the proto-energy when it interacts with
      matter (e.g. the Earth). As our Earth is embedded in this sea of
      proto-energy, it gets penetrated by this energy and is subject to
      inter-actions with it. The difference between the amount of
      incoming and outgoing proto-energy physically results in a pushing
      force which, in a way, pushes us onto the Earth! (see Fig. 4).
      While passing the Earth the proto-energy experiences an intensity
      reduction (screening effect) and exits on the other side with
      reduced strength. It is assumed that ca. 5 to 10% of the
      proto-energy get "absorbed". This part is transformed into other
      energy forms of various kinds! Hence, gravity which is falsely
      referred to as an "attractive" force is actually a manifestation
      of the proto-energy as a pushing force!<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fig.4</span><span
        style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp; Gravity is actually a pushing
        force.</span><br>
      <br>
      Now the following question arises: What happens to the
      proto-energy that remains in the Earth? According to my research,
      other energy forms or spectra emerge as follows...<br>

      The inventor, natural scientist and founder of Aquapol Company was
      born on 25 November 1954 in Vienna.<br>
      <br>
      Engineer Wilhelm Mohorn's principal subjects of interest were
      mathematics and physics. He graduated in engine construction.
      During his study of the humanities he realized that general
      awareness of energy physics was very poor. This fact - and a few
      old and corroded music instruments in his cellar - were the
      reasons for his research into alternative sources of energy, or
      conversion of energy.<br>
      <br>
      His fourth invention was a breakthrough in draining masonry using
      sources of energy that had been lying idle until this time.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Abstract </span>-- In a device
      for conveying damp or salts, e.g., to dry masonry, with at least
      one electrical conductor wound into a coil (100) and fitted in a
      housing, the winding diameter of the coil (100) diminishes
      spirally from one end to the other. Here the distance between the
      windings of a spiral or wedge-spiral coil (100) and the coil axis
      in the inward direction is 40 to 60 % smaller on each full
      revolution than the previous distance. On average, therefore, this
      gives: for the spiral radius measured at 90 DEG : R'1 = R1-R2/4;
      at 180 DEG : R''1 = R1-R2/2; at 270 DEG : R'''1 = R1-R2x3/4; at
      360 DEG : R2 = R1/2.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Random transport of moisture and
        salts</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      The invention relates to a device for transporting moisture or
      salts, for example, arranged in brickwork, with at least one, in a
      case, a coil winding electrical conductor, wherein the winding
      diameter of the spiral coil is smaller at the end of the end.<br>
      <br>
      There are known devices of this kind, without the direct contact
      with the substances or be exercise and should be no direct
      connection to a power source is a loaded and / or enffeuchtende
      effect. The effect of these devices is that through certain
      high-frequency electromagnetic fields of certain frequencies in
      the microwave range in porous capillary material systems, eg.,
      building materials or soil, the adhesion forces between molecules
      and Stoffmolekulen wetland to be disturbed. This leads to a
      lowering of the humidity level.<br>
      <br>
      Devices in the lower high frequencies work, for example, by forced
      excitation by corresponding existing short waves of short-wave
      resonant frequencies can cause exactly the opposite, for example
      by causing the diode effect of the wall by increasing the wall
      potential, and thereby cause an increase in wall moisture. Most of
      these devices are available in three resonance spectra more or
      less capable of resonance, namely the mechanical spectrum of the
      electromagnetic spectrum and relatively recently discovered
      spectrum, namely the gravomagnetic spectrum.<br>
      <br>
      A wave consists gravomagnetische, if detectable, from a linear,
      elliptical, or circularly polarized magnetic waves and a magnetic
      component to the shaft rotating circularly polarized gravitational
      wave component.<br>
      <br>
      On a wave oscillation of the magnetic component usually enffallen
      several oscillations of the gravitational wave component.<br>
      <br>
      The devices were known in the electromagnetic spectrum by
      environmental radiation resonate, they had the above mentioned
      effects. In most cases, these effects were, however imperfect and
      they were very often not foreseeable Dependent influences.<br>
      <br>
      The invention has therefore set itself the goal of a device of the
      type mentioned at that it is independent of various external
      influences can always act in an optimal way. Ereicht this is the
      fact that the distance between the coils of a spiral or conical
      spiral coil of the coil axis inwards to smaller with each full
      rotation by 40% to 60% than the previous distance.<br>
      <br>
      It has been shown in numerous experiments that an inventively
      equipped device is much better suited to meet the requirements as
      one of the known devices, which has the spirally wound coil
      constant winding distances, and, moreover, connected between the
      ends of the coil, a trouble-prone capacitor are needed.<br>
      <br>
      In an inventive embodiment, a converter has to convert
      electromagnetic energy into energy gravomagnetische a housing in
      which an external power source connected to a pulley at a distance
      from the end of Inner conductor Koaxialteiles one is arranged
      which is connected with a spiral coil located outside the housing.<br>
      <br>

      following description in conjunction with the subclaims.The

      The conical spiral coil of<span style="font-weight: bold;"> FIG 2</span>
      corresponds to the spiral coil of FIG 1 with the difference that
      the turns at a helix angle between alpha, preferably 20 and 30,

      <br>
      The in Figures1 and 2 illustrated embodiments are the simplest
      form of a novel polarization generator gravomagnetischen receive
      dar. This coil structure from the ground gravomagnetische
      Erdfelder with the frequency of hydrogen, with an alignment is
      needed in north-south direction. From above will receive free
      cosmic energy and converted into energy gravomagnetische with the
      frequency of the hydrogen.The polarity of the emitted field is
      depending on the either left or Coil development quite polarized.
      The intensity of the emitted field is much stronger than the
      intensity of the existing gravomagnetischen field of the Earth.
      Thus, the system generates a potential, eg in the masonry, so that
      the water molecules down (at right polarization) or up (at
      Linkspolariation) wall.<br>

      advantageously connected via a solder connection. The entire unit
      is appropriate as printed Circuit formed.<br>
      <br>
      The function is essentially the function of the coils of FIGS 1 or
      2, but it is not required and the generated field is moreover
      stronger.<br>
      <br>
      According to Figure 4 are two counter-wound multiple spiral coils
      105 and 106 arranged on either side of the insulating plate 104.
      The two multi-spiral coils 105 and 106 are connected to each other

      the polarization generator dar. Using a piece of wire 3 is the
      unit 1 with a multi-spiral coil 2 according to FIG 3
      conducting.The two multi-spiral coils 1 and 2 are held by a holder
      4 at a distance from each other. The holder 4 is secured by means
      of an adhesive 5 on the lower part 7 of the existing aluminum
      housing 6. Fastening screws 8 complete the left half of Figure 5
      shown the device.<br>

      There are so many individual spiral coils 100 exists as a single
      spiral coils are arranged in the multi-spiral coil 2. The plate 9
      is held by a holder 11 which holds the two multi-spiral coils 1
      and 2 in position.<br>
      <br>
      In both embodiments shown in FIG5, there is a separation of
      functions of the coils: the multiple spiral coil 1, a receive-only
      part of the gravomagnetischen Wasserstoffeldes represents the
      earth and the multiple spiral coil 2 is the polarizing unit that
      emits energy in the polarized state. Both multiple spiral coils
      make up the generator.<br>
      <br>
      One such device is designed for use on different gravomagnetischen
      Field polarities suitable and can be used anywhere in the world.
      By Umlenkspulen 100, the field is more downward.<br>
      <br>
      When Exemplary according to figures 6 and 7 is above the
      multi-spiral coil 1, a cylindrical coil 11 as Gwndspule arranged.
      Among the two coils 1 and 11, a field stabilizer 16 is in the form
      of a disk of copper or aluminum.<br>
      <br>
      Designed as a coaxial rod antenna 17 is inserted into the soil
      isolates. Whose inner conductor is connected by a cable 18 via a
      variable resistor 19 with the multiple spiral coil 1 connected
      electrically.<br>
      <br>
      Such a rod antenna may be necessary for high performance systems,
      especially in the Bodenbefeuchtung. Systems with a smaller number
      of turns of about 24 do not require such a rod antenna.<br>

      wires 13a and 13b are connected, which are passed through the
      center of Umlenkspulen 12, by a respective tube 29.The length of
      the wires 1 and 3a 1 3b depends on the number of turns of the
      solenoid 11, the larger the number of turns of Ground coil 11, the
      greater should be the length of the wires 1 3a and 1 3b be. The
      axis of wires 1 and 3a 1 3b should be essentially with the axis of

      Using novel devices, it is also possible, for example, a
      desalination conduct of the masonry.<br>
      <br>
      It has been shown that with a dehumidification in the existing
      masonry salts (nitrates, sulfates, chlorides, carbonates) in the
      plaster or with frescoes in the painting wall. To make this
      prevent can use the same types of equipment for the Enffeuchtung,
      only with different working frequencies, the resolution Salt
      molecules be transported by specific frequency-dependent fields
      down.The sense of winding of the coil systems is counterclockwise,
      inversely as the Enffeuchtungsger Ten.<br>
      <br>
      If, during the dehumidification instantaneous radii R1 (1) of 10.5
      cm or a multiple of uses thereof, are at the desalination units
      corresponding to different frequencies currently four radii of
      20.5 cm, 31.3 cm, 15.6 cm and 23.4 cm applicable. Tolerances on
      the order of about 15% are possible.<br>
      <br>
      Be in the presence of salts in the first capillary-substance
      systems Desalination units established that after about 2-6 months
      and deducted against the Dehumidifiers be replaced. The trained
      according to the above moment radii spiral coils can be arranged
      one above the other in a housing so that a single device that
      responds to all four frequencies arises.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Such a device is schematically

      radii. For other types of salts, other radii or additional coils
      are used with different radii.<br>
      <br>
      In the context of the invention are numerous Amendments
      possible.Also, the applications of an inventive device are very
      diverse; particular is a use for damping geopathogenic zones. It
      can still be resolved by means of devices according to the
      invention, fog-like conditions by the fact that the cloud-forming
