      </center>
      <p>A Sydney inventor has refused a giant American oil company’s
        offer to buy out his method of turning tap water into fuel. The
        offer is one of more than a dozen Mr Yull Brown, of Auburn, has
        received. </p>
      <p>Mr Brown’s invention allows oxygen and hydrogen extracted from
        ordinary tap water to be used safely for almost any type of
        burning fuel. He envisages the day when cars, stoves, heating
        and most of industry can be run on water or the gas extracted
        from it. He has perfected his invention in a cutting and welding
        torch, similar to an oxyacetylene torch, which is 30 times
        cheaper than present torches and burns with a flame seven times
        hotter. </p>
      <p>Mr Brown says his company has spent more than $650,000 on the
        invention, which has taken shape in his backyard workshop over
        the past seven years. </p>
      <p>"I will not sellout to any big company because they are all the
        same, protecting their interests", he said. "People before have
        had similar inventions to mine and they have sold out and
        nothing has been heard of then inventions again". </p>
      <p><b>Alternate</b> </p>
      <p>"I don’t know whether the Americans want to buy it to use it or
        to take it right of the market and protect their oil interests.
      </p>
      <p>"I think that while there is a drop of oil left in the world
        they will try to stop alternate power sources, so I will ignore
        their offer. </p>
      <p>"Companies that sell petrol and industrial gas have invested
        millions of dollars in plant and steel bottles --- they don’t
        want to know about an invention that can use 10 gallons of water
        to produce enough gas for 6 weeks’ work or to run a car". </p>
      <p>Mr Brown said he would start producing commercial models of his
        welding torch within the next couple of months while a company
        in England did the same thing there. </p>
      <p>He has patented his invention in 32 countries, and has entered
        into a $500,000 agreement with the English firm for the
        production of his cutting torch. </p>
      <p>Mr Brown said the other offers --- from Britain and European
        forms --- would be considered. </p>
      <p>"Only one Australian firm has approached me since I announced
        the perfection of my method last week, but I would like to see
        all the other developments take place here". </p>
      <p>The torches will incorporate an electric arc welder, will cost
        about $1300, and will produce about 10 cubic feet of gas for
        about 6 cents.<br>

      <p><b><i>Australasian Post</i> (February 16, 1978)</b> </p>

        <p><b>[ No Author / Title Info Available ]</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>The most talked-about inventor in Australia today is Yull Brown
        of Sydney --- the man who uses ordinary water as the fuel for
        all his inventions. </p>
      <p>To non-scientific minds it must be a bit hard to swallow, but
        it’s all perfectly true. Mr Brown, 55, has succeeded, among
        other things, in running a Mazda car, and Holden car engine on
        water fuel. </p>
      <p>He worked as a laboratory technician for a while and later
        branched into business son his own. </p>
      <p>A few years ago, a group of seven businessmen put up $700,000
        in a company called Water Fuel Holdings to finance Mr Brown’s
        experiments. </p>
      <p>But what was Mr Brown’s original inspiration to use water as a
        fuel source? When we stop for a moment and consider the
        possibilities of water-fuelled ships, cars, and even jumbo jets,
        it all sounds like something for a Jules Verne novel --- and
        that, in fact, is where Mr Brown got his idea. </p>
      <p>In 1875, Jules Verne in his book <i>The Mysterious Island</i>,
        wrote the following passage: </p>
      <p>"Water decomposed into its primitive elements, and decomposed
        doubtless by electricity, which will then have become a powerful
        and manageable force. Yes, my friends, I believe that water will
        one day be employed as a fuel". </p>
      <p>And that’s a fair assessment of how Mr Brown does it. He
        produces his hydrogen-oxygen mixture by electrolytic
        dissociation of water by electrolytic dissociation of water
        under the action of DC electrical current. </p>
      <p>He has also successfully demonstrated a new type of welder,
        powered from energy derived from water that could very soon make
        him a multi-millionaire. </p>
      <p>Small wonder that a steady stream of scientists and electronics
        experts from all over Australia have been beating a path to Mr
        Brown’s modest laboratories in the outer Sydney suburb of
        Auburn. </p>
      <p>It seems that just about everyone with a scientific mind in
        this country wants to know how Yull Brown’s inventions work... </p>
      <p>A short, solidly-built man with powerful forearms, Mr Brown is
        aware that his inventions are bound to create a lot of enemies
        in big business if and when they are ever launched into
        commercial use. </p>
      <p>"Some businesses stand to lose millions when my inventions are
        accepted", he said, "so it would be a simple matter for them
        topay some gangster $10,000 and get me put out of the way. </p>
      <p>"I used to carry a pistol in a holster on my belt until a few
        weeks ago. The police saw me wearing it on a television
        interview and they came around the next day and took it away
        from me. All I’ve got to protect me now is my German Shepherd
        called Ali Baba". </p>
      <p>He separates the two gases by passing an electric current
        through water, and has devised a way of storing them, as a
        mixture, with no more danger than in the handling and storing of
        other fuels. </p>
      <p>Australian experts who have examined Mr Brown’s work have
        agreed that he has made a notable breakthrough in the field of
        oxy-hydrogen experiments. </p>

        </p>
        <p><b>by Paul White</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>Yull Brown is the man responsible for that popular urban myth
        of the car that runs on water. When he first developed his new
        water electrolysis process in the mid-70s he found a safe,
        non-explosive method of separating water into oxygen and
        hydrogen. He built a device that converted his car to run on the
        hydrogen from water, with oxygen as the only exhaust emission.
        He was shown on television at the time actually filling his car
        with an ordinary garden hose! </p>
      <p>A skeptical world was amused by the oddball news snippet. Then
        Mr Brown began to have problems. He was, of course, loudly
        denounced as a crank. Scientific experts were quoted as saying
        the new technology was "physically impossible" and "ludicrous".
        Absolutely no one would give him a research development load.
        Approaches to the automobile industry only brought derision. His
        bank foreclosed the mortgage on his home and, shortly
        thereafter, he made television news again because of attempts
        made on his life. Shots were fired into his kitchen. </p>
      <p>Realizing that his new technology aroused the considerable
        opposition of different corporations, Yull Brown disappeared
        from public view with his water-car and set off on another track
        to research and develop he new electrolysis process he had
        discovered. The water-car became another urban myth along with
        crocodiles in the sewers under the city. </p>
      <p>Suddenly, last year, Mr Brown surfaces with a way of turning
        water into fire.Under the corporate name of B.E.S.T Aust. Pty.
        Ltd. He introduced a commercial range of revolutionary Gas
        Generator Welders. Disposing completely with conventional
        bottled gas, this new water-powered system generates a gas mix
        called Brown’s Gas which produces a flame that can cut, fuse,
        weld, solder and braze. Brown’s Gas has some remarkable
        characteristics which include being able to weld a steel pipe to
        brick with perfect molecular fusion! </p>
      <p>The new company tried to float on the Sydney Stock Exchange for
        development funds but a mysterious smear campaign of crank phone
        calls defaming the product and claiming scientific documentation
        that proved fraud so disturbed the Sponsoring Broker that
        confidence was lost and all funds were returned to investors.
        This year (1988), with the enthusiastic backing of a Korean
        businessman, the company was floated again, quietly with a
        minimum of fuss, on the Hobart Stock Exchange. </p>
      <p>It may take a little while for the new technology to sink in
        but Mr Brown reports an unprecedented avalanche of enquiries and
        requests for information since the press reported his successful
        bid on the Stock Exchange. The most startling claim by the
        inventor in the press is that the gas produced in his process
        can reduce nuclear and toxic waste to harmless carbon. </p>
      <p>Mr Brown’s company is now in full production of the
        revolutionary new welding machines, and is making first
        deliveries. A larger version of the device is about to be
        shipped to the USA where its ability to destroy plutonium and
        other problem toxic wastes will be tested. </p>
      <p><b>The Technology</b> </p>
      <p>In 1973, Prof Brown found that if hydrogen and oxygen were
        carefully mixed in the same proportion found in water (two
        hydrogen atoms to each oxygen atom) they would burn much more
        safely. He developed the first high efficiency electrolysis cell
        to produce his unique gas mix in a confined gas mix causes it to
        implode rather than explode. It burns faster with higher
        efficiency than any other gas mix. The flame front propagates at
        3 km/second compared with only 10 m/sec for oxy-acetylene. This
        means that with the gas burned at high pressure extremely
        intense heat can be produced in a tiny volume. </p>
      <p>In one instant the flame can be the temperature of a candle,
        and you can wave your finger through it. Then, it will melt and
        split granite or fuse metal pipes to house bricks. Brown’s gas
        can reach 6000 degrees, the hottest known temperature. Tungsten,
        the most heat-resistant metal which melts at 3600 degrees,
        changes directly from a solid to a dark gas under the welder. </p>
      <p>Mr Brown theorizes that the temperature of the flame is
        determined at the surface of the material through an interactive
        process between the hydrogen molecules and the atomic bonds in
        the object being welded. Essentially, he argues, this is a
        controlled thermonuclear reaction. </p>
      <p>To use Brown’s gas as an energy source, it is detonated by a
        spark which immediately forms a vacuum. Atmospheric pressure
        then sucks water or any other liquid through a container or
        hollowed area, electricity and water are the only elements
        needed to activate and fuel the unit. Yull Brown has converted
        the engine of his car to run on the mix. Atmospheric pressure
        forces the pistons down into the cylinders to occupy the
        near-vacuum caused by the implosion of the gas. </p>
      <p>One wonders if the now much-mooted Greenhouse Effect might
        break down the resistance of certain major corporations to
        Brown’s gas generators being used to run cars and aircraft run
        on water sooner rather than later. Indeed, this remarkable
        Australian technology may have surfaced just in time to offer a
        healthy alternative to present polluting power sources. </p>
      <p>The water generator and welder have up to 30 different
        applications covering the following technical areas: Glazing and
        kiln operation, mining and mineral separation, drying of foods,
        rocket fuel production, silica conversion, primary production,
        irrigation, etc. Techniques are: Air-conditioning and cooling,
        coal to oil conversion, pollution, smoke cleaning and
        disintegration of toxic waste, cheap hydrogen production,
        welding and brazing, liquid displacement, water pumps, graphite
        production, industrial and somatic heating and cooking,
        motor-cars, railways, ships, waste gas conversion, vacuum
        systems, and the timber industry. </p>
      <p>Don’t look back but it looks as if the future may well have
        arrived! </p>

      </center>
      <p><b>Dr Brown’s Gas Production Differs From Electrolysis of Water</b>
      </p>
      <p>The electrolysis method of separating water into its components
        of hydrogen and oxygen is accomplished by passing an electric
        current through water and is known since the early 1880s. Though
        various methods of water electrolysis have been developed, these
        require that the two gases, hydrogen and oxygen, are passed into
        separate chambers due to the volatile nature of the gases when
        mixed. If a volume of hydrogen is mixed with a volume of oxygen
        in a percentage greater than 5%, a violent explosion occurs.
        Likewise when oxygen is mixed with hydrogen. Water electrolysis
        cells are generally not an efficient or economic source of
        energy. </p>
      <p>Brown’s proprietary process results in Brown’s Gas, a gas
        containing ionic hydrogen and oxygen in proper mixtures which is
        generated economically and safely and which can be compressed up
        to 100 psi. It was first patented in Australia in 1977, with
        patents granted in over 30 countries since. Six models of
        generators are in production. </p>
      <p><b>Brown’s Gas Implodes to Vacuum + Water</b> </p>
      <p>With his system, 1 kWh of electricity produces 340 liters of
        gas. One unit of water yields 1866.6 units of the gas --- and
        the inverse applies as well. Upon ignition, Brown’s Gas implodes
        --- resulting in 1865.6 units of vacuum with one unit of water.
        The end result of implosion is always pure water. The vacuum may
        be generated in a device without moving parts. </p>
      <p><b>Thermal Effects of Brown’s Gas</b> </p>
      <p>Standard blowtorches may be used to burn the gas, ignition
        being obtained with a hot spark. Thermal energy is generated by
        the interaction of ionic oxygen with the material coming in
        contact, while the ionic hydrogen penetrates the material beyond
        the oxidizing (heated) matrix domain, permitting a cooling
        effect beyond. Brown’s Gas has achieved temperatures at above
        6000 C --- the temperature of the sublimation of Tungsten (1/8"
        diameter tungsten rod will vaporize within 30 seconds).
        Evaluations show that Brown’s Gas welding is anywhere from 7.06
        to 58.33% less expensive than oxy-acetylene gas welding,
        depending on cost of electricity. The generators used for
        welding purposes are manufactured by the major high-tech Chinese
        manufacturing facility, NORINCO in Baotou, sold by Brown’s Gas
        International Corp. in the USA. </p>
      <p><b>Ultra-Performance Fuel for Engines</b> </p>
      <p>The February 9, 1978 Hansard of the New South Wales Legislative
        and Legislative Assembly in Australia reports that Yull Brown
        has driven his car 1,000 miles (1,600 kilometers) tone gallon of
        water. </p>
      <p><b>Brown’s Gas for Deep-Space Life Support</b> </p>
      <p>Brown’s Gas has been found to be of particular value in
        replacing air, helium and oxygen for deep-sea breathing. It
        permits doubling of the depth of manned diver penetration to
        about 2,050 meters (over 6,750 feet) without narcosis effects,
        and full working capacity despite the high pressures, as was
        demonstrated in 16-day tests. </p>

      <p><b>Extracting Precious Minerals</b> </p>
      <p>This report is strictly a preliminary report on using the flame
        from Brown’s gas BN-200 Gas Generator extract complex Sonoran
        Desert ores for assaying. It is in no way to be construed as a
        final answer nor a methodology in the pretreatment or treatment
        of ores for precious metal recovery. </p>
      <p>Many months, if not years, of research still remain before any
        real answers can be given with any degree of certainty as to the
        effectiveness of the treatment of ores that exist in the world.
      </p>
      <p>Tests completed to date by this writer are on ore from three
        mines near Tonopah, AZ. They are: Hummingbird Group, Sierra
        Associates, and Number Three Mine. Ore from all these mines were
        known to contain gold, some silver, and the platinum group.
        Silver, because of its low quantity and low price, has been
        discounted in these tests. These ores are a complex of many
        elements and compounds and have not been workable with any of
        the commercial processes for recovery of precious metals.
        Recovery can be made on the laboratory bench, but no commercial
        process has been developed that will work. In addition, the
        values in these ores can’t be concentrated. </p>
      <p><b>Otherwise Economical Recovery</b> </p>
      <p>The complexity of the ores causes them to be not amenable to
        any type of fire assay, giving very little or no metals in the
        cupel. Assays can be made with complex, uneconomical chemical
        processes in the lab. Attempts to scale up with these processes
        have been dismal failures. </p>
      <p>Tests conducted by this writer and his associates initially
        were with 1/6 assay ton samples. The flame was played across and
        through the ores for different lengths of time and the changes
        in colors and reactions were noted. </p>
      <p>These samples were then fire-assayed using a straightforward,
        common flux, crucible fusion, cupel method. Surprising results
        occurred the first time with odd-looking odd-colored beads
        remaining in the cupel. These beads were then weighed and pasted
        with hot dilute nitric acid to expel silver, palladium, and
        other unwanted metals. The remaining particles were again
        weighted and digested in aqua regia. </p>
      <p><b>Successful, Enhanced Recovery</b> </p>
      <p>The gold was then precipitated out and the residuals were again
        put back in solution to digest the platinum and the rhodium and
        the precipitants reduced to metal and weighed. </p>
      <p>Metal recovery was consistent with the AA readings. The
        chemical assay results were read on the AA and no attempt was
        made to recover the metals, as the AA readings were consistent
        with readings and recoveries from the fire assays. A third set
        of tests has confirmed these results. A videotape is being made
        that will show is being made that will show the methods used,
        the reactions taking place and results. </p>
      <p>The important discovery here is the ability after flame
        treatment to use a straightforward fire assay to determine the
        values in the ore. To this writer’s and to his associate’s
        knowledge, this has never been done with any degree of certainty
        or consistency. Also, never has the platinum from these ores
        been this easy to get in hand as metal. </p>
      <p>Gold values were somewhat lower (1.86 oz/ton) than previous
        tests would indicate; however platinum (17.2 oz) and rhodium
        were higher. These tests have proven what was known: that these
        ores carry extremely good commercial values, even though no
        process existed to extract them. </p>
      <p>The next set of planned tests will attempt to determine dwell
        time upon each of these ores for maximum assay recovery. Through

              Breakthrough"</font></b> </p>

          <b>Tomahawk Resources, Inc. (Vancouver, BC, Canada)</b></p>
      </center>
      <p><b>What is Brown’s Gas?</b> </p>
      <p>Brown’s Gas is the product of the dissociation of water by
        electrolysis, using the gas generator patented world wide by
        Professor Yull Brown. It is a completely safe, compressed
        stoichometric mixture of atomic and molecular hydrogen and
        oxygen. It is colorless, odorless, lighter than air, and
        non-toxic. </p>
      <p><b>Properties of Brown’s Gas</b> </p>
      <p>Brown’s Gas burns with a clean flame. It will burn in a vacuum,
        or under water. It uses no atmospheric oxygen, and creates only
        pure water as its sole combustion product. </p>
      <p>Brown’s Gas contains no hydrocarbons, and therefore is
        incapable of producing carbon dioxide, or any other atmospheric
        pollutant, when ignited. </p>
      <p>Brown’s Gas cannot explode; indeed, it implodes upon ignition.
        One liter of water produces 1860 liters of gas. When this gas is
        ignited, the volume is reduced to the original one liter of
        water. This characteristic is very useful in the creation of
        near-perfect vacuums. </p>
      <p>Brown’s Gas is produced from a very plentiful fuel, water, and
        is may times less expensive than conventional bottled gas. </p>
      <p>Very high temperatures are obtainable when Brown’s Gas is
        ignited using a standard torch. Brown’s Gas is strongly ionized,
        and exhibits many of the characteristics of plasma, at a small
        fraction of the cost. </p>
      <p><b>Advantages of Brown’s Gas</b> </p>
      <p>Brown’s Gas is derived from ordinary water, a plentiful and
        readily available fuel, is safe and pollution-free, and presents
        no hazard to the environment. </p>
      <p>Due to its stoichometric nature, Brown’s Gas normally burns
        with a perfectly neutral flame. This flame can be modified,
        fluxed and switched from a reducing to an oxidizing flame at
        extremely high frequencies. </p>
      <p>The heat is highly concentrated, can be applied with extreme
        accuracy and is axial in nature. </p>
      <p>Brown’s Gas is produced on demand, where and when needed so no
        storage is required. It can, therefore, be used in locations
        where bottled gas is prohibited. </p>
      <p>Since Brown’s Gas is lighter than air no dangerous
        concentrations of gas are likely. Since it uses no oxygen from
        the atmosphere, it can be used safely in closed spaces. Brown’s
        gas is completely safe to generate and use, is pollution-free
        and does not contribute in any way to the greenhouse effect. </p>
      <p>All Brown’s Gas Generators are subject to a one-year guarantee
        against defective materials and workmanship. </p>
      <p><b>Features of the Brown’s Gas Generator</b> </p>
      <p>Brown’s Gas is supplied at 280-400 kpa (40-60 psi). </p>
      <p>Brown’s Gas is produced at the rate of approximately 340 liters
        per kilowatt of DC electricity. </p>
      <p>Brown’s Gas Generators are fully safely, and are approved for
        manufacture and use by the New South Wales Department of
        Industrial Relations. </p>
      <p>Have an automatic, fully regulated pressure system. They are
        equipped with a pressure regulator, and pressure, voltage and
        amperage gauges. Bo internal compressor is required, the gas is
        generated and pressurized with no moving parts. </p>
      <p>All units are compact, mobile, solidly constructed, with a
        durable baked enamel finish. </p>
      <p>The Brown’s Gas Generator is easily installed, as well as
        simple and safe to operate. </p>

      The following item was printed in the February 1998 PACE
      (Planetary Association for Clean Energy) newsletter and is
      followed by a response from Dr. William A. Rhodes, Yull Brown is
      now deceased.
      <p>'An inventor who has been referenced before issuance of the
        Yull Brown patents is now making claims on the Internet for
        precedence for generation and single-ducted use of mixed atomic
        hydrogen and oxygen. William A. Rhodes of the Arizona State
        University, refers to his US patents 3,262,872 issued July 26,
        1966 and 3,310,483 of March 21, 1977, about 5 years before Yull
        Brown discovered his process in a small Sydney, Australia lab in
        1971. Over 20 examiners, from Australia to the United Kingdom,
        did not agree when they granted some 30 patents to Yull Brown in
        the mid-1970s. <br>
        The mixed gas produced by the Rhodes system is different and
        does not have the unique - and for most conventional scientists
        - 'anomalous' physical properties of Brown's gas. Essentially,
        Brown's gas comes already mixed and compressed at determinable
        levels, straight out of the electrolysis, while the Rhodes'
        system is mixed in a 2:1 ratio after electolysis prior to
        membranes and onto conduits and then to the torch. </p>
      <p>Browns's gas burns in a vacuum, is subject to implosion - as a
        single reaction - when sparked or heated, has a variable flame
        temperature of about 138 C to over 6,000 C at which tungsten
        sublimates and allows transmutation. </p>
      <p>The Rhodes system allows for a production in 20, 75, 150 and
        300 litres of mixed gas per hour. While 340 litres of Browns Gas
        are generated per 1kwh, only 167 litres of the Rhodes mixed gas
        are. The Rhodes system can use an 'outboard' alcohol booster
        tank that increases BTU output while decreasing the flame
        temperature of the standard 3,315 C to about 1,930 C. </p>
      <p>The Rhodes system is manufactured by Arizona HydroGen
        Manufacturing, 4225 East Madison Street, Phoenix, AZ 85034. It
        has applications in welding, soldering, polishing and annealing
        in industrial electronics, jewelry manufacturing, dental
        laboratories, glass, ceramic and plastics industries. Details:

        From: WILLIAM A. RHODES <br>
        To: Jerry Decker <br>
        TO: Planetary Association for Clean Energy </p>
      <p>I am William Rhodes, whom your following newsletter was aimed
        at. </p>
      <p>Since my research documentation covering my invention of the
        Single Ducted Oxy-Hydrogen system was complete on Keelynet (see
        links below), I am puzzled by your statements. However, your
        questions will be answered for correction further clarification
        (Yours in quotes.): </p>
      <p>"An inventor who has been referenced before issuance of the
        Yull Brown patents is now making claims on the Internet for
        precedence for generation and single-ducted use of mixed atomic
        hydrogen and oxygen. William A. Rhodes of the Arizona State
        University, refers to his US patents 3,262,872 issued July 26,
        1966 and 3,310,483 of March 21, 1977, about 5 years before Yull
        Brown discovered his process in a small Sydney, Australia lab in
        1971." </p>
      <p>** I am *now* making claims? Look at Yull Brown's first U.S.
        patent. My patent is clearly listed as a reference there and
        dated 11 years prior to his. I used two years of experimenting
        before going for a patent. ** </p>
      <p>"Over 20 examiners, from Australia to the United Kingdom, did
        not agree when they granted some 30 patents to Yull Brown in the
        mid-1970s." </p>
      <p>** What did Examiners not agree on? Certainly it cannot be my
        date of issuance or the invention itself? If not, then what? So
        far, this dealt with non-applicable trivia. Many patent attor-
        neys get jobs with the patent office because they were not
        intel- ligent enough to remain in private practice. I have about
        60 patents. </p>
      <p>One case involved technology so strange I was attacked as a
        fraud, and my application rejected. Time does not permit details
        except to say, the invention was gross simplification of an
        electrostatic generator using water dripping through two open
        cans. It's predecessor existed for sale in an old Central
        Scientific catalog. It contained four cans. I ripped out the
        page and mailed it to the examiner with a note that said, "If I
        am a fraud, then the company selling its equivalent is also a
        fraud." US 2,742,58l patent issued immediately. Now, lets look
        at more of your complaints.** </p>
      <p>"The mixed gas produced by the Rhodes system is different and
        does not have the unique - and for most conventional scientists
        - 'anomalous' physical properties of Brown's gas. Essentially,
        Brown's gas comes already mixed and compressed at determinable
        levels, straight out of the electrolysis, while the Rhodes'
        system is mixed in a 2:1 ratio after electrolysis prior to mem-
        branes and onto conduits and then to the torch." </p>
      <p>** I would certainly appreciate your explanation of what is
        unique about Brown's Gas. I examined his patent and find nothing
        different in his gas from mine. In either case compression of
        such gases must not approach 400 psi where auto-ignition occurs.
        Rhodes gas likewise comes straight from the electrolysis tank,
        ALREADY MIXED, but NOT in a 2:1 ratio. It is a stoichiometric
        mixture of 1:1 (atom for atom). A 2:1 ratio cannot be stoichio-
        metric and would cause incomplete burning. There are no mem-
        branes and "conduits". Mine is a single conduit. Whomever wrote
        this either did not read, did not understand, or too hastily
        scanned the document on Keelynet.** </p>
      <p>"Browns's gas burns in a vacuum, is subject to implosion --- as
        a single reaction --- when sparked or heated, has a variable
        flame temperature of about 138 C to over 6,000 C at which
        tungsten sublimates and allows transmutation." </p>
      <p>** Excuse me! There is no scientific reason why any combustible
        gas mixture chosen would not burn in a vacuum. This is an
        oxymoron. The degree of vacuum is not mentioned. Not much of a
        vacuum can exist with combustion occurring in it. The pumping
        system merely sucks gases out the burner orifice. "Implosion?"
        Implosion always occurs in both Brown and Rhodes. All hot gases
        "implode" on a continuous basis, with continuous combustion. To
        be proper, it should be called "volume shrinkage". When combus-
        tion ceases, regardless of the gas species used the byproducts
        of combustion and internal atmosphere SHRINKS toward ambient
        pres- sure. This is just plain high-school physics, in open air
        or partial vacuum. So far the author has a failing grade in
        physics. This implosion myth has been circulating many years. It
        comes from the scientifically ignorant. ** </p>
      <p>"The Rhodes system allows for a production in 20, 75, 150 and
        300 liters of mixed gas per hour. While 340 liters of Brown's
        Gas are generated per 1kwh, only 167 liters of the Rhodes mixed
        gas are. The Rhodes system can use an 'outboard' alcohol booster
        tank that increases BTU output while decreasing the flame
        temperature of the standard 3,315 C to about 1,930 C." </p>
      <p>** How was the liters per kw determined? The Rhodes
        electrolyzer system delivers the maximum output from a proper
        amount of potas- sium hydroxide (KOH). (Read the Keelynet
        document again.) In the States, there are two manufacturers
        claiming 100% efficiency. That, dear friend, would mean an
        electrolyte with zero resist- ance, presently impossible. They,
        including Yull Brown, were not aware that instruments used for
        such measurements must be capable of accurately reading all
        power delivered harmonics. Using the wrong instruments can and
        does provide readings in excess of true energy used. </p>
      <p>Example: If electrical energy is through a converter that
        yields spikes occupying say 10% of the duty cycle, then false
        readings can produce a miracle by showing an efficiency of 300%
        or more. A gross impossibility. With that we would have, hooray,
        over-unity -- free energy from nothing. (Yull Brown's higher gas
        yields per 1kwh are no doubt instrument errors.) The only way to
        determine true energy input vs BTU delivered is using a
        watt/hour meter of the type seen on homes and businesses,
        followed by a calorimeter. They read ALL energy, not just
        portions of it. The last three sentences in the previous text
        about the alcohol booster are almost correct.** Instruments used
        in compiling the original Keelynet document were NIST
        calibrated. Nothing was left to chance. I would advise you read
        and understand it before launching such ridiculous trivia as
        found here. Somehow I touched a nerve yielding an emotional
        response instead of a scientific one.** </p>

        as oxy-welding, oxy-cutting, atomic welding, and welding or
        cutting in combination with electric arc techniques. The
        invention also provides for the generation of hydrogen and
        oxygen for the abovementioned applications in combination
        therewith or separately. </p>
      <p>A most important application of the invention is atomic welding
        utilizing the properties of atomic oxygen in combination with
        atomic hydrogen (for welding) or atomic oxygen separately (for
        cutting). This particular application of the invention is based,
        among other things, on the appreciation that considerable energy
        is associated with the dissociation of molecular oxygen into
        atomic oxygen by passing this gas through an arc, and that this
        property can be usefully employed to generate temperatures even
        higher than those previously attainable with, for example, an
        atomic hydrogen flame. The significance of the energy which can
        be obtained in this way can be appreciated from the following
        reactions that take place, and the heat energies associated
        therewith, when hydrogen and oxygen are both passed through an
        electric arc. Thus: <br>

      <p>On recombination of these atoms this energy is released as heat
        through a number of complex chemical reactions and results in an
        extremely high flame temperature. Previously it would not have
        been considered possible to practically pass oxygen or a mixture
        of oxygen and hydrogen together through an arc due to the highly
        explosive or inflammable nature of such gases. However in
        accordance with the concepts of the present invention this is
        indeed both possible and practical and, as mentioned above,
        enables the realization of much higher welding or cutting
        temperatures than hitherto obtainable by known practical means.
      </p>
      <p>One of the objects of the present invention is to provide a
        method and apparatus whereby hydrogen and oxygen can be
        generated quickly and conveniently for immediate use for
        welding, etc., without many of the disadvantages associated with
        conventional gas welding practice. For example, the practice of
        employing cylinders (or "bottles") of gas, usually oxygen and
        acetylene can have significant disadvantages, particularly for
        users working remote from a supply depot and for whom there
        might be an appreciable delay between the placing of an order
        for a delivery of gas the the actual delivery. For such users,
        in order to ensure an adequate supply of gas when a particular
        job demands it, it is often necessary to order fresh supplies in
        advance, even before the supply on hand is fully used, or else
        risk running out of gas before a job is completed. Since bottles
        of gas are generally delivered on a strictly exchange basis --
        in that a used bottle must be returned in exchange for a
        refilled bottle -- the practice can mean a significant waste, as
        far as the user is concerned, if bottles containing useful
        amounts of unused gas have to be returned to the supplier. </p>
      <p>The practice of using bottled gas also has associated with it a
        large number of other problems such as the possibility of gas
        leaking from bottles, possibility of industrial disputes which
        can result in severe delays in delivery and in supply shortages,
        liabilities, high purchase and storage costs, freight charges,
        and so on. </p>
      <p>To illustrate some of the conditions which the consumer of
        bottled gas must put up with, listed below is a summary of the
        "conditions of sale" which apply to the sale and distribution of
        bottled gas. </p>
      <p>a. The cylinder remains the sole property of the supplier,
        which retains the right to exercise at any time its proprietory
        powers in its discretion. </p>
      <p>b. All cylinders and contents are forwarded at the expense and
        risk of the customers. </p>
      <p>c. It is the responsibility of the customers to provide
        adequate labour for the loading and unloading of all cylinders
        at the premises. </p>
      <p>d. Cylinders are to be returned to the supplier as soon as
        empty, carriage and freight charges paid. </p>
      <p>e. A cylinder is not `returned` until received by the supplier
        at its works or warehouse or by its truck and a receipt on the
        suppliers form given for the same. No document purporting to be
        a receipt for any such cylinder shall be valid unless it is the
        suppliers printed form of receipt. </p>
      <p>f. Cylinders are not transferable and must not be used for any
        purpose other than as containers for the gas sold by the
        supplier and must not be delivered or sent for recharging to any
        place other than the suppliers gas station. </p>
      <p>g. The customer agrees not to resell to any person or
        Corporation, the gas contents of the cylinders of any part
        thereof. </p>
      <p>h. Customers are held responsible for all loss or damage to
        cylinders from whatever cause arising from the time of delivery
        until returned to the suppliers. (Customers are advised to cover
        the cylinders by insurance). </p>
      <p>i. Where a customer has not returned a cylinder in good order
        and condition within six months from the date of delivery, the
        supplier may, at its option, charge the customer with an amount
        not exceeding the agreed value of the cylinder and the demurrage
        due in respect thereof, and such amount is payable by the
        customer as liquidated damages for the detention of the
        cylinder. Notwithstanding the payment of such amount in respect
        of any cylinder, it remains the property of the suppliers and
        the right of the suppliers to recover possession thereof is not
        affected in any way. </p>
      <p>j. No allowance is made on any residual gas returned in the
        cylinders. </p>
      <p>k. And many other conditions varying in the different countries
        in the world. </p>
      <p>Another disadvantage, which is associated with oxy-hydrogen
        welding arises due to the marked ability of hydrogen to be
        absorbed by most metals. Thus when welding steel, for example,
        great care must be taken to ensure that excess hydrogen is not
        present otherwise it will be absorbed in the metal to cause loss
        of strength and brittleness. On the other hand, an excess of
        oxygen would cause burning of the metal and should thus equally
        be avoided. It is most important therefore that with
        oxy-hydrogen welding the mixture at the burner be adjusted to
        produce a neutral flame, that is, one in which there is neither
        excess hydrogen nor excess oxygen. In practice it is most
        difficult to maintain (and virtually impossible to judge by
        flame colour) a neutral flame, and for that reason oxy-hydrogen
        welding is not widely used despite the inherent advantages of
        low cost and high heat value offered by hydrogen as a fuel. </p>
      <p>These and other disadvantages can be overcome to a significant
        extent by the present invention whereby hydrogen and oxygen fuel
        are generated simultaneously by electrolysis in an electrolytic
        cell and allowed to freely mix therein to form a stoichiometric
        mixture that will burn with a neutral flame. The fuel gas can be
        generated where and whenever required thereby eliminating the
        need for storage of bottles of gas and reliance on regular
        deliveries of gas which often cannot be guaranteed. </p>
      <p>The method of the present invention requires no diaphragms or
        the like to separate the hydrogen and oxygen liberated by the
        electrolysis process and thereby enables considerable advantages
        to be realized over conventional electrolytic production of
        these gases. Such diaphragms have normally been regarded as
        essential for conventional electrolytic generators in order to
        separate the two gases that would otherwise form a highly
        explosive mixture; however, it has been found, in accordance
        with the present invention, that the two gases can be safely,
        and usefully, produced and utilized as a mixture for fuel
        purposes provided that suitable safety precautions, such as the
        employment of a flash-back arrestor, are taken. Such safety
        precautions may include, for example, the employment of a device
        which removes electrolyte vapour from the gas and at the same
        time acts as a flash-back arrestor. In obviating the need for
        diaphragms or the like the present invention enables the
        electrodes to be placed much closer together and avoids the high
        resistance associated with diaphragms, which in turn enables a
        significant increase in the rate of gas production for a given
        size of apparatus. In short the present invention enables the
        manufacture of small size equipment that is useful for a large
        variety of welding and similar work and that is not
        prohibitively bulky for the average situation: something which
        is impossible with conventional hydrogen-oxygen generating
        equipment. </p>
      <p>In the development of apparatus from the basic concept of
        generation of hydrogen and oxygen electrolytically in a
        practical manner suitable for large industrial applications on
        the one hand, and small domestic applications on the other hand,
        a number of factors had to be taken into account, analysed and
        weighed one against the other. The following is a list of some
        of these factors to illustrate what has been involved. </p>
      <p>a. Endosmotic pressure to be balanced against the hydrostatic
        pressure of the fluid. </p>
      <p>b. Rate of flow of electric current in relation to the area of
        the electrodes. </p>
      <p>c. The prior art problem of removing the gases from anolyte and
        catholyte, before diffusion and before the electrolytes are
        intermixed. </p>
      <p>d. Effects of rapid changes in the rate of flow of electricity
        through the cell. </p>
      <p>e. Effects of auxiliary decomposition within the anode and
        cathode sides of the cell. </p>
      <p>f. The choice of the most readily ionized electrolyte of a
        maximum conductivity. </p>
      <p>g. The least possible spacing between anode and cathode that
        can be employed. </p>
      <p>h. A design of cell in which previously it was regarded
        impossible for the H.sub.2 and O.sub.2 given to become mixed
        with safety, which does away with diaphragms or the like which
        would increase the internal resistance, in which both hydrogen
        and oxygen can be mixed within the cell, and in which cells can
        be connected in series, parallel, or parallel and series to suit
        requirements. </p>
      <p>i. The choice of materials for the electrodes. </p>
      <p>j. The quantity of acids or alkali to be used. </p>
      <p>k. The shapes of cells according to purpose of the cells, and
        the application for which they are designed. </p>
      <p>l. The possibility of improvement with permanent or
        electro-magnetically induced fields applied to the electrolytic
        cells, to cause controlled separation of a quantity of the gases
        generated in the cells. </p>
      <p>m. Ensuring effective circulation of electrolyte between the
        electrodes, with as little electrical resistance as possible. </p>
      <p>n. The possibility of using sodium hydroxide or potassium
        hydroxide which, in concentrations from 10% up to 30%, which has
        negligible corrosion action on iron or nickel electrodes, apart
        from producing a solution of good conductivity. </p>
      <p>o. The use of the cooling effect by passing of hydrogen and
        oxygen gases, for cooling electrolyte in the cell, for
        controlling the cell temperature, preferably between 40.degree.
        C to 60.degree. C, at which temperature the bonds between
        hydrogen and oxygen need a minimum of electrical energy to
        break. </p>
      <p>g. The separation of hydrogen and oxygen from a mixture, using,
        possibly, a permanent magnetic field, or an electro-magnetic
        field which can be controlled to obtain a desired separation
        between the hydrogen and oxygen. Based on this principle, the
        oxygen could be substantially separated from the mixture and the
        hydrogen could be absorbed by, for example, selected metals,
        which have high absorption affinity for hydrogen (for example,
        paladium which absorbs 900 times more hydrogen from its volume).
        Also, using the principle of the invention, hydrogen and oxygen
        can be generated in large quantities with small units and the
        oxygen could, for example, be separated and used to supply
        hospitals, baby rooms, air conditioning systems, or for any
        other application, when oxygen is required. Oxygen can, in this
        way, be generated much faster and more conveniently than with
        conventional electrolytic generating equipment. </p>
      <p>q. The possibility of absorbing the hydrogen or oxygen by
        specially selected materials in small containers and where the
        absorbed gas can be extracted when desired for welding or
        brazing where it would be inconvenient or impossible to do so
        with conventional equipment. </p>
      <p>r. Making the welding operator entirely independent of any gas
        suppliers. </p>
      <p>s. The generation of cheap gas, up to 6 to 7 times cheaper than
        normal gas supplies. </p>
      <p>t. The design of equipment which gives not only professional
        welders, but handymen, or people who would like to do welding at
        home with oxy-welding apparatus, but would do it only
        occasionally and could not justify the expense associated with
        conventional gas supplies. Such people cannot justify paying for
        bottles of gas for a single welding only (having to keep the
        bottles, paying rent for them to keep them up to two years, to
        perform the next welding). For this reason, the welding
        apparatus made possible by the present invention is ideal
        because it produces gases for welding at the time and in the
        quantity that is needed. </p>
      <p>u. Hydrogen-oxygen welding has the advantage that it does not
        pollute the atmosphere as does oxy-acetylene welding. </p>
      <p>v. The design of electrolytic cells which are safe to use as
        well as convenient, which cells may incorporate their own
        flash-back arrestors as a safety precaution or an equivalent
        means, to prevent the hazards of explosion or fire. </p>
      <p>w. The control of the current which passes through the cells,
        the temperature of the cell, which is a function of current, the
        control of the separation of the gases, and the removal from the
        gases of electrolyte vapours. In this regard there has been
        designed a special unit with preferably conical electrodes, and
        a flash-back arrestor. The flash arrestor may be constituted by
        a pellet of porous material, or a long capilliary pipe located
        between the gas generator and a burner head. The fire hazards
        associated with a mixture of hydrogen and oxygen cannot be
        overemphasized and indeed it is probably mainly because of the
        recognized dangers associated therewith that extreme lengths
        have been taken to separate the two gases completely until they
        reach the burner. In accordance with the present invention it
        has been realized that, contrary to long standing opinions, the
        gases can be safely mixed together even when being produced and
        as a result many desirable advantages can be realized. </p>
      <p>x. The provision of one or more safety valves adjusted to
        convenient pressure for releasing excessive pressures in the
        cell (for example, greater than 30 p.s.i.) which may result, for
        example, if a current control mechanism fails. The safety valves
        could be attached to an alarm, for example, to indicate a
        failure in the current control mechanism or the cut-off
        switches, etc. </p>
      <p>y. Porous material may conveniently be placed in the burner
        head, so that backfire through the burner into the cell cannot
        occur. </p>
      <p>In summary, the present invention contemplates, as an important
        feature thereof, a universal welding apparatus capable of being
        used to perform different types of welding operations based on
        the utilization of hydrogen and oxygen, making full use of the
        advantages which can thereby be realized, and equipment which
        can be made small and portable compared with existing apparatus
        such as that presently used for gas welding using bulky bottled
        hydrogen. To generate the fuel, in accordance with the invention
        a small compact electrolytic cell is made possible in which the
        only raw material which has to be replenished from time to time
        is water and which can be used whenever a source of electrical
        energy is available to supply the necessary amount of hydrogen
        or hydrogen and oxygen mixture for performing atomic welding or
        hydrogen-oxygen flame welding. In its simplest form, the gas
        generating apparatus of the present invention comprises an
        electrolytic cell adapted to be connected to an energy source,
        optionally through a step down transformer and rectifier, and
        having means for connection to a burner, preferably through a
        flash-back arrestor as a safety precaution. </p>
      <p>The apparatus may be combined with a transformer as a single
        compact unit and for convenience the transformer may be provided
        with several windings to enable it to be used for auxiliary
        purposes such as battery charging, electroplating, arc welding
        or to provide an arc for atomic welding. </p>
      <p>It has been found that a single electrolytic cell operating
        without diaphragms at several hundred amps will generate
        hydrogen and oxygen at a reasonable rate for small welding and
        brazing work but for larger work (for example, the welding of 10
        mm steel plate) the required amperage becomes excessive
        (typically of the order of 900A or more) when considering the
        size of conductors and transformer and the problem of heat
        generation. Accordingly, in one aspect of the invention these
        problems can be significantly reduced by arranging a plurality
        of cells in series and using a much smaller current to obtain
        the same effective gas output. In effect the capacity of a
        series of cells for a given current input is that of a single
        cell multiplied by the number of cells. Alternatively the
        current requirement is reduced by a factor equal to the number
        of cells -- for a given rate of gas production. </p>
      <p>Even so a large number of separate cells can be excessively
        bulky for portable applications and in a further aspect of the
        invention, therefore, the bulk can be greatly reduced by
        arranging the cells as a single unit in which a number of
        electrodes, effectively in series, are arranged adjacent each
        other in a common electrolytic chamber, the chamber being
        provided with a gas collection space and an outlet for
        connection to, for example, gas burner means. Furthermore, only
        the end electrodes need be connected to an external source of
        electrical energy and the arrangement as a whole can be made
        extremely efficient and compact. Additionally the need for a
        transformer for most applications can be eliminated by such an
        arrangement so that the apparatus can be designed to be
        electrically connected directly to a main electrical supply,
        through a bridge rectifier if desired. By eliminating the need
        for a transformer, the gas generating equipment as a whole can
        be made surprisingly compact, to be well suited for small
        domestic requirements as well as heavy industrial requirements.
      </p>
      <p>In another important aspect of the invention, there is provided
        a safety device which monitors the pressure of hydrogen and
        oxygen being generated and regulates the current flowing through
        the cell(s) to increase or decrease the rate of gas production
        depending on the pressure. In one form the device comprises a
        chamber containing two electrodes, at least one of which is
        conical, arranged in the chamber (which normally contains a
        conductive liquid) and the electrodes being connectable in
        series with one or more electrolytic cells used for
        oxygen-hydrogen production. </p>
      <p>The pressure responsive, current regulating device can be
        designed as an integral part of the electrolytic cell(s) or can
        be used as an attachment connectable externally and in series
        with the gas generating cell(s). The device can also be designed
        to combine the functions of a current regulating device and a
        flash-back arrestor, the latter function ensuring that a flame
        at the burner does not accidentally pass back through the hose
        lines to the highly explosive mixture in the gas generating
        cell(s). The device may incorporate a total current cut-out
        feature or may be used in combination with a cut-out device
        which fully interrupts the supply of electrical power should the
        pressure in the cell(s) accidentally exceed a maximum safe
        value. The current regulating device may also operate to
        regulate the current passing through the cells in accordance
        with the temperature to maintain the temperature within a
        desired range. </p>

      <p>Referring to the drawings, FIG. 1 shows schematically a single
        electrolytic cell 10 operating to produce a mixture of hydrogen
        and oxygen, which mixture is passed through a flash-back
        arrestor 11 to a burner 12. The cell 10 contains two plate
        electrodes 10a and 10b immersed in an electrolyte consisting of
        a solution of KOH in water and connectable through terminals 13
        and 14 respectively to a source of a.c. or d.c. electricity.
        Preferably, d.c. is used as the electrical impedance of the
        cell, is much lower for d.c. than for a.c. The source of
        electricity may be a transformer, typically of 300 Amps output
        rating, connected to the cell through a bridge rectifier. The
        flash-back arrestor 11 is constituted by a water bath in which
        gas liberated in the cell 10 passes through a tube 15 into the
        water bath 11 and thence through a tube 16 to the burner 12. The
        arrangement is suitable for small welding and brazing work but
        becomes too bulky for very large work. </p>

      <p>FIG. 2 illustrates in vertical cross-section an electrolytic
        cell 20 which requires a much lower current than the cell
        illustrated in FIG. 1 for a given current input. The cell 20
        comprises what is in effect a series of cells constituted by a
        plurality of plate electrodes immersed in a solution of KOH in
        water. For convenience the electrodes are designated as 20a for
        the two electrodes at the ends and 20b for the intermediate
        electrodes. The electrodes 20a are connected, via conductors 21
        to terminals 22 for connection to an external supply of
        electricity. The mixture of hydrogen and oxygen which is evolved
        at the electrodes when an electric current is applied, passes
        through an outlet opening 23 to a flash-back arrestor and thence
        to a burner (not shown in FIG. 2). The series of electrodes 20a
        and 20b are sealingly mounted in a tube 24 of insulating
        material which is provided with restricted apertures 24a at the
        top and 24b at the bottom, between each pair of electrodes. The
        apertures 24a permit gas to escape into the space 25 above the
        surface of the electrolyte and the apertures 24b permit
        electrolyte to enter freely into the spaces between each pair of
        electrodes. By virtue of this arrangement the electrical
        resistance between any two adjacent electrodes is far less than
        that between non-adjacent electrodes so that the arrangement is
        effectively one of a large number of individual cells connected
        in series. A very compact arrangement is therefore obtained but
        one which permits a relatively high gas production rate for a
        reasonably low current input. For example, a structure like that
        shown, consisting of the equivalent of, for example, 120 cells
        can generate gas at a current input of 15A (at, for example,
        240V) equal to that of a single cell requiring a current input
        of approximately 1800A. This means in practice that a relatively
        portable apparatus can be produced which can be connected
        directly, without a transformer, to most domestic electrical
        supplies and which can maintain a sufficient rate of gas
        production for most types of welding work. </p>
      <p>An advantage which particularly distinguishes the arrangements
        disclosed from conventional gas welding apparatus is that the
        hydrogen and oxygen are automatically produced in substantially
        the correct proportions to give a neutral flame. No mixing
        valves are required and even unskilled personnel can produce
        satisfactory welds without difficulty. In fact indications are
        that many welds can be produced better than by any other welding
        process. </p>

      <p>FIG. 3 illustrates a pressure responsive safety device 30
        operably connected in series (electrically) with an electrolytic
        hydrogen-oxygen cell 31 for regulating the current passing
        therethrough in accordance with the gas pressure being
        generated. The device, or cell 30 comprises a chamber 30' in
        communication with a reservoir 32 via a passage 33. Two conical
        electrodes 34 and 35 are mounted in spaced relation within the
        chamber and connected in series between a d.c. source (not
        shown) and the electrolytic cell 31. An electrolytic solution of
        KOH and water is provided within the chamber, portion of which
        enters the reservoir 32. When the cell 31 is operating to
        produce hydrogen and oxygen the pressure of the gas being
        produced acts on the surface of the electrolyte in the chamber
        30' to displace an amount of the electrolyte into the reservoir
        32 against back pressure exerted by air trapped in the
        reservoir, the amount of electrolyte displaced depending on the
        pressure of the gas in the chamber 30'. At the same time the
        area of contact between the electrodes and the electrolyte in
        the cell 30 reduces in proportion to the drop in electrolyte
        level, causing the electrical resistance of the cell 30 to rise
        and the current passing therethrough to fall. Should the gas
        pressure drop the electrolyte level in the cell 30 will rise and
        the current passing into the cell 31 will also rise. Thus the
        cell 30 operates to regulate the rate of gas production in
        accordance with the pressure produced and prevents excess gas
        pressure to build up in the cell 31. </p>

      <p>FIG. 4 illustrates an alternative form of safety device which
        is operable to make or break the connection between an
        electrolytic hydrogen-oxygen cell (not shown in FIG. 4) and an
        electric current source. The device comprises a cylindrical
        container 40 in fluid communication with a liquid reservoir 41
        via a passageway 42, and a quantity of mercury 42' contained in
        the container and reservoir. Two electrodes 43 and 44 are
        disposed one above the other in the container 40 and are
        normally immersed in the mercury with a conductive path thereby
        formed between them. The container is connected electrically in
        series with an electrolytic cell (or cells) and in gaseous
        communication therewith through a hose 45. An increase in gas
        pressure resulting from generation of gases by the electrolytic
        cell(s) causes the mercury to be displaced towards the reservoir
        and the mercury level in the container 40 to fall. When the
        pressure exceeds a predetermined level the mercury level falls
        below that of the electrode 43 and electrical connection between
        the two electrodes is broken. The electrical connection is again
        restored when the gas pressure falls. A non-inflammable liquid,
        such as silicone oil or freon is provided on top of the mercury
        to ensure that any arc which may be generated between the
        electrode 43 and the mercury is totally isolated from the gases
        above the liquids. </p>

      <p>FIG. 5 shows schematically an arrangement whereby an
        exceedingly hot flame can be produced using the gaseous mixture
        generated electrolytically by the apparatus previously
        described. In this arrangement a mixture of hydrogen and oxygen,
        preferably in stoichiometrical proportion, is passed via a line
        50 between a pair of tungsten electrodes 51 to produce molecular
        dissociation of the hydrogen and the oxygen and a very hot flame
        52. It can be appreciated that whereas in an atomic hydrogen
        flame a significant temperature rise is obtained by striking an
        arc in the hydrogen, an even greater temperature rise can be
        realized by striking the arc between the oxygen as well since
        the dissociation energy of molecular oxygen is of the same order
        of magnitude as that of molecular hydrogen. </p>

      <p>FIG. 6 illustrates an arrangement for the magnetic separation
        of oxygen from a mixture of oxygen and hydrogen, whereby the
        oxygen can be used for flame cutting. The apparatus consists of
        a chamber 60 containing a magnet 61 and is located in a conduit
        62. A mixture of hydrogen and oxygen is passed through the
        conduit and around the magnet 61. The diamagnetic oxygen is
        diverted by the magnetic field into a transverse passageway 63
        to a central conduit (not shown) leading from this passageway
        and thence to a flame-cutting head. The paramagnetic hydrogen
        continues along the conduit, past the magnet and can be allowed
        to escape or can be collected, as desired. If the magnet is an
        electromagnet it can be turned off when hydrogen and oxygen is
        required as a mixture, and in that case the downstream side of
        the conduit 62 can be closed off to prevent the loss of gas. </p>

      <p>FIG. 7 illustrates a complete oxy-hydrogen generator and
        welding apparatus comprising a gas generator 70, a current
        regulating cell 71 and a power supply 72. The construction of
        the electrodes 73 of the generator 70 and 74 of the cell 71 are
        identical with those illustrated in FIGS. 2 and 3 respectively.
        In this arrangement, however, the gas generator 70 and cell 71
        are combined as an integrated unit and as such has some features
        not found in the arrangements shown in FIGS. 2 and 3. In
        particular the chamber 75 of the generator 70 and the chamber 76
        of the current regulator cell 71 are separated by two partitions
        77 and 78 defining between them a passageway communicating
        between the two chambers. The respective electrodes of the cell
        71 and a generator 70 are connected electrically in series with
        the power supply. </p>
      <p>Gas produced by electrolysis in the chamber 75 rises into the
        space in the chamber above the electrodes 73, passes down the
        passageway between the partitions 77 and 78, bubbles through the
        electrolyte in the chamber 76 and thence passes through an
        outlet opening 79 to a burner 80. An air trap reservoir 81 is
        formed integrally with the cell 71 and is in liquid
        communication therewith through an opening between the bottom of
        the reservoir and the cell. When the pressure of the gas
        generated by the generator 70 rises, this pressure causes the
        electrolyte in the chamber 76 to be displaced into the reservoir
        81 resulting in a reduction of the current being passed to the
        generator 70 by the mechanism previously described in relation
        to FIG. 3 of the drawings. In this way the cell 71 effectively
        monitors the gas pressure and regulates the current to maintain
        an approximately constant pressure. To ensure against the
        possibility that the pressure should accidentally exceed a
        predetermined maximum safe value, a spring-loaded safety
        pressure valve 82 is provided at the top of the reservoir 81 to
        release the excess pressure into the atmosphere. </p>
      <p>The burner 80 is provided with a flash-back arrestor in the
        form of a porous ceramic pellet 83 located in the gas flow path
        between the handle part 84 of the burner and the burner tip 85.
        The flash-back arrestor acts by quenching any flame blowing back
        into the burner before the flame has a chance to reach the hose
        86 connecting the burner with the gas generator. </p>
      <p>The power supply is of the universal type, that is, it is
        provided with a transformer 87 connectable to an alternating
        current electrical supply and provided with a number of
        electrical outlets for various purposes. One winding of the
        transformer is connected to a bridge rectifier which provides
        the d.c. current for the gas generator. Another winding is used
        for arc welding or can be used to supply an arc for atomic
        oxy-hydrogen welding. It will be appreciated that the
        transformer is optional and that the generator can be connected
        directly to the mains. In fact the bridge rectifier is not
        essential either and can be omitted if desired. </p>
      <p>In the operation of apparatus of the type described it is often
        required to conveniently change between neutral and oxidizing
        flames, for example when changing from a welding operation to a
        cutting operation and the present invention makes provision for
        the variation of these functions. Briefly, in accordance with
        the present invention, apparatus for either oxy-hydrogen welding
        or cutting may comprise a first electrolytic generator for
        generating hydrogen and oxygen by the electrolysis of water in
        substantially stoichiometric proportions to produce a neutral
        flame and a further electrolytic generator from which hydrogen
        and oxygen are separately delivered, which means for adding
        either the hydrogen from this further cell, or the oxygen from
        the further generator to the gas mixture obtained from the first
        generator. This arrangement results in a most efficient
        combination of functions when a neutral flame or other is
        required. The hydrogen gas produced by the further generator,
        when added to the flame mixture, burns with atmospheric oxygen
        thereby producing a reducing flame. When an oxidizing flame is
        required, the additional hydrogen is cut off and the oxygen
        produced by the further generator is added to the flame mixture.
        It will be appreciated that various designs can be employed for
        either generator, for example, they may be completely
        independent or they may share a common electrolyte. The further
        gas generator can also, in practice, be made somewhat smaller
        than the other generator since it does not have to produce the
        bulk of the gas required. </p>
      <p>It has been found that welding with hydrogen and oxygen in an
        exact 2 to 1 ratio (as when the gases are produced
        electrolytically) results in a particularly clean, oxide free
        welded surface and a strong welded joint. For the same quality
        welding to be produced by conventional gas welding technique
        substantially greater skill is required and, in the case of
        conventional hydrogen welding, for example, good welded joints
        are obtained only with great difficulty due to the extreme
        difficulty in obtaining and maintaining a neutral flame. With
        the method of the present invention there is no difficulty in
        obtaining a neutral flame, and hence the ease with which high
        quality welds can be obtained. </p>
      <p>Finally, it can sometimes be convenient to store hydrogen
        and/or oxygen, generated electrolytically in a specially
        designed container, or to slowly accumulate these gases and
        then, when required, using the accumulated stored gas for extra
        heavy work for a short time. It is quite hazardous to pressurize
        a mixture of hydrogen and oxygen under very high pressures, of
        course, but it is possible, in accordance with one aspect of the
        invention, to store a useful amount of gas in a relatively small
        volume at low pressures and this can be done by using a highly
        gas absorbent metal in the storage container. The metal
        palladium, for example, can absorb up to 900 times its own
        volume of hydrogen and can be used with advantage for this
        application. In fact useful amounts of hydrogen, for small scale
        brazing work can readily be stored in a small hand held
        container, containing a gas absorbent material.<br>
