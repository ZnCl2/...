generates electricity, speeds wound healing in rats</span><br>
</div>
<div style="text-align: left; margin-left: 40px;">
&nbsp; <br>
Skin has a remarkable ability to heal itself. But in some cases, wounds
heal very slowly or not at all, putting a person at risk for chronic
pain, infection and scarring. Now, researchers have developed a
self-powered bandage that generates an electric field over an injury,
dramatically reducing the healing time for skin wounds in rats. They
report their results in ACS Nano.<br>
<br>
Chronic skin wounds include diabetic foot ulcers, venous ulcers and
non-healing surgical wounds. Doctors have tried various approaches to
help chronic wounds heal, including bandaging, dressing, exposure to
oxygen and growth-factor therapy, but they often show limited
effectiveness. As early as the 1960s, researchers observed that
electrical stimulation could help skin wounds heal. However, the
equipment for generating the electric field is often large and may
require patient hospitalization. Weibo Cai, Xudong Wang and colleagues
wanted to develop a flexible, self-powered bandage that could convert
skin movements into a therapeutic electric field.<br>
<br>
To power their electric bandage, or e-bandage, the researchers made a
wearable nanogenerator by overlapping sheets of polytetrafluoroethylene
(PTFE), copper foil and polyethylene terephthalate (PET). The
nanogenerator converted skin movements, which occur during normal
activity or even breathing, into small electrical pulses. This current
flowed to two working electrodes that were placed on either side of the
skin wound to produce a weak electric field. The team tested the device
by placing it over wounds on rats' backs. Wounds covered by e-bandages
closed within 3 days, compared with 12 days for a control bandage with
no electric field. The researchers attribute the faster wound healing
to enhanced fibroblast migration, proliferation and differentiation
induced by the electric field.&nbsp;<br>

Skin wound healing is a major health care issue. While electric
stimulations have been known for decades to be effective for
facilitating skin wound recovery, practical applications are still
largely limited by the clumsy electrical systems. Here, we report an
efficient electrical bandage for accelerated skin wound healing. On the
bandage, an alternating discrete electric field is generated by a
wearable nanogenerator by converting mechanical displacement from skin
movements into electricity. Rat studies demonstrated rapid closure of a
full-thickness rectangular skin wound within 3 days as compared to 12
days of usual contraction-based healing processes in rodents. From in
vitro studies, the accelerated skin wound healing was attributed to
electric field-facilitated fibroblast migration, proliferation, and
transdifferentiation. This self-powered electric-dressing modality
could lead to a facile therapeutic strategy for nonhealing skin wound
treatment...<br>
<br>
The therapeutic effects of ES for wound healing were first observed in
the late 20th century.(17,18) It is believed that an electric field is
essential for directing many cellular processes that lead to orderly
healing naturally.(19,20) As summarized in the literature,(21) ES can
decrease edema around the electrode; lyse or liquify necrotic tissue;
stimulate growth of granulation tissue; increase blood flow; cause
fibroblasts to proliferate and make collagen; induce epidermal cell
migration; attract neutrophils; stimulate neurite growth directionally;
promote epithelial growth and organization; decrease mast cells in
healing wounds; attract macrophages; and stimulate receptor sites to
accept certain growth factors. Although the influence from an electric
field can be significant, clinical applications of electrical
stimulation for wound healing typically involves large-sized
extracorporeal devices to provide appropriate electrical fields and may
require patient hospitalization.<br>
<br>
The recent innovation of nanogenerator (NG) technology opened a route
for generating periodic biphasic electric pulses by locally converting
mechanical displacements, such as body or muscle motions.(22-27) This
exceptional capability makes NG a candidate for producing electrical
stimulations that is self-sustainable and biologically responsive.<br>
