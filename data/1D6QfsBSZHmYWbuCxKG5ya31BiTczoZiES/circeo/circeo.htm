        <p><b><font size="+1">Florida county plans to vaporize landfill
              trash</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>FORT PIERCE, Fla. (AP) — A Florida county has grand plans to
        ditch its dump, generate electricity and help build roads — all
        by vaporizing garbage at temperatures hotter than the sun. </p>
      <p>The $425 million facility expected to be built in St. Lucie
        County will use lightning-like plasma arcs to turn trash into
        gas and rock-like material. It will be the first such plant in
        the nation operating on such a massive scale and the largest in
        the world. </p>
      <p>Supporters say the process is cleaner than traditional trash
        incineration, though skeptics question whether the technology
        can meet the lofty expectations. </p>
      <p>The 100,000-square-foot plant, slated to be operational in two
        years, is expected to vaporize 3,000 tons of garbage a day.
        County officials estimate their entire landfill — 4.3 million
        tons of trash collected since 1978 — will be gone in 18 years. </p>
      <p>No byproduct will go unused, according to Geoplasma, the
        Atlanta-based company building and paying for the plant. </p>
      <p>Synthetic, combustible gas produced in the process will be used
        to run turbines to create about 120 megawatts of electricity
        that will be sold back to the grid. The facility will operate on
        about a third of the power it generates, free from outside
        electricity. </p>
      <p>About 80,000 pounds of steam per day will be sold to a
        neighboring Tropicana Products Inc. facility to power the juice
        plant's turbines. </p>
      <p>Sludge from the county's wastewater treatment plant will be
        vaporized, and a material created from melted organic matter —
        up to 600 tons a day — will be hardened into slag, and sold for
        use in road and construction projects. </p>
      <p>"This is sustainability in its truest and finest form," said
        Hilburn Hillestad, president of Geoplasma, a subsidiary of
        Jacoby Development Inc. </p>
      <p>For years, some waste-management facilities have been
        converting methane — created by rotting trash in landfills — to
        power. Others also burn trash to produce electricity. </p>
      <p>But experts say population growth will limit space available
        for future landfills. </p>
      <p>"We've only got the size of the planet," said Richard Tedder,
        program administrator for the Florida Department of
        Environmental Protection's solid waste division. "Because of all
        of the pressures of development, people don't want landfills.
        It's going to be harder and harder to site new landfills, and
        it's going to be harder for existing landfills to continue to
        expand." </p>
      <p>The plasma-arc gasification facility in St. Lucie County, on
        central Florida's Atlantic Coast, aims to solve that problem by
        eliminating the need for a landfill. Only two similar facilities
        are operating in the world — both in Japan — but are gasifying
        garbage on a much smaller scale. </p>
      <p>Up to eight plasma arc-equipped cupolas will vaporize trash
        year-round, non-stop. Garbage will be brought in on conveyor
        belts and dumped into the cylindrical cupolas where it falls
        into a zone of heat more than 10,000 degrees Fahrenheit. </p>
      <p>"We didn't want to do it like everybody else," said Leo
        Cordeiro, the county's solid waste director. "We knew there were
        better ways." </p>
      <p>No emissions are released during the closed-loop gasification,
        Geoplasma says. The only emissions will come from the synthetic
        gas-powered turbines that create electricity. Even that will be
        cleaner than burning coal or natural gas, experts say. </p>
      <p>Few other toxins will be generated, if any at all, Geoplasma
        says. </p>
      <p>But critics disagree. </p>
      <p>"We've found projects similar to this being misrepresented all
        over the country," said Monica Wilson of the Global Alliance for
        Incinerator Alternatives. </p>
      <p>Wilson said there aren't enough studies yet to prove the
        company's claims that emissions will likely be less than from a
        standard natural-gas power plant. </p>
      <p>She also said other companies have tried to produce such
        results and failed. She cited two similar facilities run by
        different companies in Australia and Germany that closed after
        failing to meet emissions standards. </p>
      <p>"I think this is the time for the residents of this county to
        start asking some tough questions," Wilson said. </p>
      <p>Bruce Parker, president and CEO of the Washington, D.C.-based
        National Solid Wastes Management Association, scoffs at the
        notion that plasma technology will eliminate the need for
        landfills. </p>
      <p>"We do know that plasma arc is a legitimate technology, but
        let's see first how this thing works for St. Lucie County,"
        Parker said. "It's too soon for people to make wild claims that
        we won't need landfills." </p>
      <p>Louis Circeo, director of Georgia Tech's plasma research
        division, said that as energy prices soar and landfill fees
        increase, plasma-arc technology will become more affordable. </p>
      <p>"Municipal solid waste is perhaps the largest renewable energy
        resource that is available to us," Circeo said, adding that the
        process "could not only solve the garbage and landfill problems
        in the United States and elsewhere, but it could significantly
        alleviate the current energy crisis." </p>
      <p>He said that if large plasma facilities were put to use
        nationwide to vaporize trash, they could theoretically generate
        electricity equivalent to about 25 nuclear power plants. </p>
      <p>Americans generated 236 million tons of garbage in 2003, about
        4.5 pounds per person, per day, according to the latest figures
        from the Environmental Protection Agency. Roughly 130 million
        tons went to landfills — enough to cover a football field 703
        miles high with garbage. </p>
      <p>Circeo said criticism of the technology is based on a lack of
        understanding. </p>
      <p>"We are going to put emissions out, but the emissions are much
        lower than virtually any other process, especially a combustion
        process in an incinerator," he said. </p>
      <p>Circeo said that both plants operating in Japan, where
        emissions standards are more stringent than in the U.S., are
        producing far less pollution than regulations require. </p>
      <p>"For the amount of energy produced, you get significantly less
        of certain pollutants like sulfur dioxide and particulate
        matter," said Rick Brandes, chief of the Environmental
        Protection Agency's waste minimization division. </p>
      <p>Geoplasma expects to recoup its $425 million investment, funded
        by bonds, within 20 years through the sale of electricity and
        slag. </p>
      <p>"That's the silver lining," said Hillestad, adding that St.
        Lucie County won't pay a dime. The company has assumed full
        responsibility for interest on the bonds. </p>
      <p>County Commissioner Chris Craft said the plasma process "is
        bigger than just the disposal of waste for St. Lucie County." </p>
      <p>"It addresses two of the world's largest problems — how to deal
        with solid waste and the energy needs of our communities," Craft
        said. "This is the end of the rainbow. It will change the
        world." <br>

        <p><b>by</b> </p>
        <p><b><font size="+1">Sheryl S. Jackson</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>While landfills are the predominant form of solid-waste
        disposal for municipalities in the U.S., people are objecting to
        the establishment of new landfills in their communities. </p>
      <p>Decreasing availability of land, worries about potential health
        problems and a growing concern for the environment have made the
        disposal of solid waste a challenge. </p>
      <p>Until landfill alternatives are developed, a short-term
        approach may be found in the laboratory of Dr. Louis Circeo,
        director of construction research at Georgia Tech. </p>
      <p>Circeo's research centers on the use of the plasma-arc torch,
        which converts gas into a plasma state similar to lightning. The
        torch can create temperatures up to 7,000 degrees--hot enough to
        melt ash, metals or any solid waste into a glassy rock-like
        substance, which also traps contaminants included in the
        original material. </p>
      <p>"The glassy by-product takes up less volume than the original
        material. That means that a landfill's life can be increased by
        five times --- to an average 100 years --- by melting current
        wastes," explains Circeo. To melt the waste in a landfill, a
        series of boreholes, each lined with a lightweight metal, is
        drilled to the bottom of the dump. The torch begins at the
        bottom of each borehole, melting the material surrounding the
        hole as it is slowly pulled up to the top. Circeo points out
        that it is important to space the boreholes close enough to the
        lava created by each melting fuse to produce a solid layer. </p>
      <p>The entire process, known as consolidation and remediation, can
        be repeated until the melted waste reaches the top of the
        landfill. </p>
      <p>Since there is virtually no leaching of contaminants from the
        melted waste and the melted waste provides a solid, stable
        foundation, the land could be safely used for development. </p>
      <p>And gases produced by the melting can be collected and used as
        fuel. </p>
      <p>While the cost of plasma-arc technology for landfill
        remediation is relatively high --- $65 per ton --- Circeo points
        out that rising land costs and new landfill regulations will
        make the plasma- arc torch a more cost-effective approach. "By
        investing in a system that captures and refuses the gases,
        remediation can even pay for itself." </p>
      <p>A by-product of the process, the glass rock, may also be sold
        for gravel or molded into other products, such as bricks. </p>
      <p>Countries using the plasma torch for waste disposal include
        France and Japan, where incineration ash is classified as a
        hazardous material and the plasma-arc torch provides a cost-
        effective way to handle the waste. Bordeaux, France's plasma
        furnace claims an annual savings of $2 million for waste
        disposal. </p>
      <p>Since the glass rock produced by the torch effectively traps
        contaminants, this process is effective for disposal of other
        hazardous material such as asbestos, medical waste and
        radioactive waste, says Circeo. </p>
      <p>In fact, Circeo is overseeing projects that are developing
        plants for the disposal of these materials for the Department of
        Energy, the Rocky Mountain Arsenal in Colorado and the Defense
        Logistics Agency. </p>
      <p>While Europe, Canada and Japan have been seeking ways to use
        plasma-arc technology for solid-waste disposal, Circeo says that
        the U.S. Swill be unable to wait much longer. </p>
      <p>"It's only a matter of time until incinerator ash and other
        materials will be classified as hazardous, as they are in other
        countries," he says. </p>
      <p>When that happens, Circeo says the plasmatorch technology will
        be waiting. </p>

      <p><b>Abstract</b> </p>
      <p>In this paper a review and assessment of the Hot Temperature
        Plasma Processing of Waste is presented. The environmental
        advantage of this method over incineration is clearly
        demonstrated. The present technology of Plasma Arcs and the
        Modern Plasma Torches Applications are also shown. An Assessment
        of the Heavy Duty Gasification Combined Cycle Turbines,
        Gasification Process, Magmavication/Vitrification process, and
        Environmental Engineering Protection are also described. </p>
      <p><b>1. Introduction</b> </p>
      <p>Imagine a process in which we convert the inorganic components
        of the municipal solid waste in architectural tiles and
        construction bricks, at the same time we convert all the organic
        contents of the waste into Synthesis gas, (basically a mix of H2
        + CO, almost a green fuel) and in addition we generate
        electrical power. Furthermore, could we have a system that
        doesn't generate ashes, and doesn't pollute the air, the water
        nor the soil, as incineration does? The answer is yes. The
        plasma torches that operate at very high temperatures (between
        5,000ºC and 100,000ºC) can process all kinds of waste: municipal
        solid, toxic, medical, biohazard, industrial and nuclear waste
        at atmospheric pressure. Effectively, the inorganic waste is
        vitrified in solid-like glass materials that are used to
        manufacture aggregates for the construction industry
        (Magmavication process) and the organic materials (plastics,
        paper, oil, bio-materials, etc.) are converted into Syngas with
        caloric value, fuel that is used on the Heavy-duty advanced gas
        turbines for the generation of electrical power (Gasification
        process). No ashes are produced because at more than 5,000ºC,
        all the organic molecules are disintegrated and only the mix of
        H2 + CO remains at high temperature. </p>
      <p><b>2. Plasma and it's technological evolution: from discharge
          tubes to torches</b> </p>
      <p>Plasma is the ionized state of matter, it's conformed by a
        quasi-neutral gas composed of charged and neutral particles,
        which exhibit a collective behavior; plasma is the most abundant
        form of matter in the universe. It is formed whenever ordinary
        matter is heated over 5,000 ºC, which results in electrically
        charged gases or fluids. They are profoundly influenced by the
        electrical interactions of the ions and electrons by the
        presence of a magnetic field. </p>

      </center>
      <p>Plasma produced with DC electrical discharge has been the
        precursor of a modern and more efficient Plasma Torch device1.
        Taken an electrical discharge tube [2,3,4] -like the classical
        schematic shown in the Fig. 1 and raising the voltage V, while
        measuring the current I following through the discharge, the
        result is a high nonlinear Voltage-Current curve. The three
        major regimes of industrially important DC low-pressure
        electrical discharges tubes are:the Dark Discharge, the Glow
        Discharge and the Arc Discharge (Shown in Fig. 2). </p>
      <p>The arc regime is comprised of three regions: the glow to arc
        transition, the non-thermal arcs, and the thermal arcs. When the
        current density is great enough to heat the cathode to
        incandescence, then a discontinuous glow-to-arc transition
        region appears in the Voltage-Current characteristic curve. This
        glow-to-arc transition happens for currents between1 and 10
        Amperes at low pressures. </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="a15fig03.gif" height="256" width="387"></p>
      </center>
      <p>As we can see in Fig. 3, thermal arcs always are found at
        higher pressures and higher gas temperature than non-thermal
        arcs; however, non-thermal arcs may also exist at atmospheric
        pressure. </p>
      <p>The total current of arcs is always more than 1 ampere and the
        current density ranges from several amperes per square
        centimeter to more than thousand amperes per square centimeter.
        The electron density of thermal arcs is higher than in
        non-thermal arcs. </p>
      <p>In non-thermal arcs, low emission arcs usually require
        thermionic emission from cathodes, whereas in thermal arcs, high
        intensity arcs usually operate in field emissions. </p>
      <p>Thermal arcs can be considered in thermodynamic equilibrium.
        Figs. 4, 5 and 6 show different types of arcs and torches: the
        transpiration stabilized arc, the coaxial flow stabilized arc
        and the axe symmetric, non-transferred, unmagnetized arc jet or
        plasma torch. </p>

      </center>
      <p><b>3. Cascade process of ionization</b> </p>
      <p>In a cascade process, one incident electron (e—) collides with
        a neutral atom to produce a second electron and an ion. There
        are then two electrons and one ion. After these two electrons
        have each collided with another neutral atom, there are produced
        four electrons and three ions. This process continues and, after
        about 20 successive sets of collisions, millions of electrons
        and ions will have been formed rapidly (the mean free path
        between collisions is very small at atmospheric pressures). </p>
      <p>The Debye length is a measure of the width of the effective
        electric field of an ion and is given approximately by the next
        formula, in which Te is the electron temperature and ne is the
        number density of electrons (per mL). lD = 6.9 (Te/ne)1/2. For a
        plasma temperature of 8,000 ºK and ne = 1014/cm<sup>3</sup>, lD
        is about 0.0006 mm, which is very much smaller than the 1mm
        sampler orifice and so ions can pass through easily. Hot gases
        from the plasma impinge on the edges of the sampler orifice so
        that deposits build up and reduce its diameter with time. The
        surroundings of the sampler orifice suffer also from corrosive
        effects due to bombardment by hot species from the plasma flame.
        These problems necessitate replacement of the sampler from time
        to time. As the gas leaves the other side of the sampler
        orifice, it experiences a vacuum of about 10-5 Torr and the
        expanding jet of gas cools very rapidly and reaches supersonic
        speeds. </p>

        Power Plasma Torches [4,5]. The author visited that facility,
        inspected one torch, and noticed the excellent performance.
        There are several manufacturers of plasma torches (a list of
        them is available on the web). However, to the author knowledge,
        only Westinghouse manufactures torches of high power even in the
        order of 10 MW (Fig. 8). Models similar to this torch are
        commercially available even in the range of 75 KW to 10,000 kW
        of power. A thermal efficiency of 90% is easily possible; the
        efficiency represents the percentage of arc power that exits the
        torch and enters the process. However, the operational
        characteristics of each torch depend of the gas composition. The
        most common gases used in plasma torches are Argon, and Helium.
        The quality of the plasma produced depends on the plasma density
        and the plasma temperature; at atmospheric pressure plasma
        torches may produce a density of 1014 cm<sup>-3</sup>. As more
        power is given to the torch, there is better quality of plasma.
        Due to the broad range of plasma temperatures and densities,
        plasmas have several applications in research, technology and in
        the industry. </p>
      <p><b>5. Plasma magmavication or vitrification process</b> </p>
      <p>Plasma torches provide efficient means for melting solids or
        waste materials into magma or a lava form, after a short time of
        interaction of the plasma (T &gt; 5000ºC) with the solids. In a
        longer cooling time, the resulting mass forms a chemically and
        physically durable igneous rock. Depending upon the original
        mineralogy and rate of cooling, the final product consists of
        either amorphous glassy material resembling volcanic obsidian or
        a crystalline igneous rock similar to granite or basalt. Several
        applications have been done in the construction industry (Circeo
        [6,7,8] et al., 2000 at Georgia Tech). The Georgia Tech group
        found a formula for the amount of vitrified mass produced, as a
        function of the plasma torches energies. The mass produced obeys
        the relation: M (kg) = 0.35 P (kW-hr), where M is the vitrified
        mass-produced in Kg, and P is the electrical energy consumed in
        the process. One application is for remediation of radioactive
        waste, where highly radioactive liquid and sludge are mixed with
        glass particles and heated to very high temperatures to produce
        a molten glass. This molten glass is then poured into stainless
        steel canisters. When the mixture cools, it hardens into a
        stable glass that traps the radioactive elements and prevents
        them from moving through the air or water into the environment.
        DOE is currently operating vitrification plants at the Savannah
        River Site in South Carolina and the West Valley Demonstration
        Project in New York. In Japan, Kobe [9,13,14] Steel LTD and The
        Kansai Electric Power Company developed a Plasma vitrification
        system. </p>
      <p><b>6. High temperature plasma processing of waste</b> </p>
      <p>Solid waste from municipalities can be processed using
        high-energy plasma torches. Plasma can process any kind of
        waste. The chemical properties and the contents of the average
        municipal waste are shown in Table 1. </p>
      <p>Westinghouse [12] has conducted many successful experiments,
        designs and developments involving the gasification and/or
        Vitrification of simulated MSW (municipal solid waste), ASR
        (auto shredder residue), fossil fuels, and industrial liquid and
        solid wastes in a plasma reactor. </p>
      <p>The gasification test material feed ranged from low Btu MSW
        (1600 kcal/kg) to medium Btu simulated auto shredder residue
        (4500 kcal/kg) and to high Btu coal (8,000 kcal/kg). </p>
      <p>Experiments were conducted where fuels were gasified to produce
        primarily carbon monoxide, CO and hydrogen, H2. The inorganic
        components of the feed were converted to molten slag that was
        removed as vitrified by product. The slag passed the
        EPA-mandated Toxicity Characteristic Leachate Procedure (TCLP)
        requirements. Emissions are very much reduced and the slag is a
        glassy product with value as a construction material base.
        Dioxins were measured at levels approximately 100 times lower
        than from an incineration plant (e.g., &lt; 0.01 ng/nm3 measured
        in stack gas), and predicted fuel gas production is observed.
        For organic waste, the production of power via a
        combustion/turbine combined cycle at much higher efficiencies
        (approximately 40% thermal efficiency versus approximately 20%
        for an incineration steam boiler plant) is an added benefit
        which makes the project cost attractive compared to
        incinerator/steam boiler MSW plants. Additionally, the high
        quality glassy material produced can be sold as a roadbed or
        construction material and the need and expense to dispose of ash
        is eliminated. </p>
      <p><b>7. Metal-electrode-plasma furnace applications</b> </p>
      <p>The plasma energy corporation has investigated the use of this
        plasma technology for treatment of municipal waste, used tires,
        polychlorobenzyl (PCB), oils and medical wastes (Pocklington and
        Corox [3], 1992; Camacho [5], 1990) since plasma can provide
        thermal decomposition of some toxic molecules into simple benign
        one's. A 300-kW level power operation has been used in a range
        of experiments. Hydrocarbon waste is fed into the furnace
        through a double door air lock system. A molten pool was formed
        in the earth. In some experiments, steam was injected to
        generate hydrogen-rich gas that could be used in future
        applications for energy production. The gases produced by the
        furnace were scrubbed to control chlorine and sulfur emissions.
        The inorganic and metals in the molten pool of the furnace were
        tapped, and vitrified (glass-like) slag and metal product was
        obtained. The electrical power requirement for conversion of one
        ton of municipal solid waste into the final products of
        vitrified solids and metals, hydrogen and carbon monoxide gas
        was 550-790 kW h. Typically 20% of the initial waste is
        converted into solid products. The remainder is converted into
        gas. Combustion of the hydrogen and carbon monoxide in the gas
        could be used to offset the electrical power requirement. </p>

      <p><b>8. Plasma gasification processes of waste</b> </p>
      <p>Gasification [9,11,13] is a simple and commercially well-proven
        technology. It involves the conversion of various feedstocks to
        clean syngas, through a reaction with oxygen and steam; this
        reaction is spontaneous at high temperature and pressure under
        reduction conditions, and consumes half of the oxygen required
        for total combustion. The raw syngas product is cooled and
        purified, it is then used in one or a combination of many
        product applications: syngas for chemicals, gaseous fuels, for
        liquid fuels burned in commercial boilers to produce steam or in
        heat transfer process and in internal combustion engines to
        produce electrical energy. Combined cycles are also possible
        leading to co-generation of electrical energy. The energy
        efficiency of biomass gasification varies from 75 to 80%, this
        depends of the composition and heat capacity of the raw
        material; Humidity and the inorganic inert matter content reduce
        the efficiency. The traditional market for syngas is focused in
        gas production as an intermediate step during the production of
        important chemicals, such as ammonia for fertilizer. However,
        application of gasification in other processes is increasing due
        to market changes associated with improved gas turbines,
        deregulation of electrical power generation, and stringent
        environmental mandates. Gasification plant capacity is reported
        in units of volumetric output of syngas (i.e., normal cubic
        meters per day). However, the Department of Energy (DOE)
        converted all the gasification input and output capacities to
        MWth. (1MWth = 3,413,000Btu/hr). Gasification is an alternative
        to combustion, and has an energy efficiency of 50%. The
        advantage consists on reducing both the atmospheric emissions
        and the volume of solid residues to be land filled. Since the
        solid residues come from a high temperature at normal
        conditions, they're inert materials that can be used as part of
        the bulk material in concrete production. </p>

      <p><b>9. Synthesis gas cleaning island</b> </p>
      <p>The purpose of this system is to remove pollutants such as
        sulfur dioxide (SO2), particulate matter, hydrochloric acid
        (HCl) and Hydrogen Sulfide (H2S) vapors from the synthesis gas.
        The primary design requirements are environmental protection and
        safe operation of the gas turbine. The basic unit operations are
        those of gas cooling, particulate removal, and acid gas
        neutralization. First, the syngas is sufficiently cooled prior
        to gas cleanup it is passed through a partial quench. The gas
        leaves the chamber at 350 ºC. The goal is to lower the gas
        temperature sufficiently so as not to damage the downstream
        equipment while maintaining the gas above saturation
        temperature. The gas then passes through a fabric filter
        bag-house to remove particulates. The blowers are each sized at
        100% to provide full redundancy. The gas is then in a saturation
        tank, which lowers the gas temperature to 50 ºC, then it passes
        through a packed bed aqueous scrubber for acid remove. Sodium
        hydroxide solution is used to neutralize the acid. The gas,
        still ''sour'' at this point, then undergoes first stage
        compression for use in the gas turbine. It then enters the lower
        section of the H2S Absorber Vessel and flows countercurrent to a
        regenerated solution of chelated iron oxide (FeO2) fluid for
        removal of any H2S. The H2S absorbed by the solution is removed
        from the bottom of the H2S Absorber Vessel and circulated by the
        Rich Solution Pump, through a Solution Cooler, and into the
        Solution Oxidizer Tank, where Air Blower introduces air. The air
        blower agitation causes the elemental sulfur to precipitate,
        forming slurry at the bottom of the Solution Oxidizer Tank. The
        slurry is removed from Solution Oxidizer Tank by a Sulfur Slurry
        Pump Tag and sent to a conveyor Sulfur Filter. The filtrate
        solution drains off and is returned to the Solution Oxidizer
        Tank, while the wet inert sulfur cake is collected for disposal
        to a non-hazardous landfill. At this point, the gas exiting the
        H2S Absorber Vessel is considered 'clean' for use as a fuel gas.
        Specific Heat Capacity of Syngas = 1.488 kJ/kg. K </p>
      <p><b>10. Gas turbine excess of energy and green energy</b> </p>
      <p>The Lower Heating Value (LHV) of the natural gas supply is
        assumed to be 11,900kcal/kg. The minimum LHV acceptable to the
        CTG is assumed to be 3,600kcal.kg. The ability of the Integrated
        Plasma Gasification Combined Cycle System (IPGCC) to use low
        calorific value (LCV) feedstock, and produce high value
        co-products, along with energy, enhance the economic viability
        of new projects. The ability to successfully burn LCV fuels like
        the case of municipal solid waste required that GE modified the
        can-annular combustion systems since 1990. GE concluded that a
        Syngas fueled combined cycle plant can have the same
        Reliability-Availability-Maintenance (RAM) performance as a
        natural gas-fueled combined cycle plant. IPGCC shows superior
        environmental performance and viability, also the power plant
        emissions are far below any other coal technology, for all the
        major pollutant categories (NOx, SOx, metals, mercury, CO2,
        sludge, water). </p>
      <p><b>11. IPGCC environmental performance</b> </p>
      <p>IPGCC is inherently "greener" than any other coal technology.
        In the process, harmful pollutants can be removed from the
        syngas before they reach the gas turbine; thus, back-end exhaust
        gas clean up is not necessary. The SOx, NOx, mercury, metals,
        and particle emissions from the plant are fractions of those of
        a conventional pulverized coal boiler power plant. Consequently,
        IPGCC plants require significantly less effort and time to meet
        air emissions regulations and to obtain local and state
        governmental environmental permits. The process is approximately
        5% more efficient than other coal power technologies; thus, CO2
        emissions per kW are also 5% lower. Additionally, in the
        process, carbon can be removed from the syngas to create a high
        hydrogen fuel that effectively eliminates CO2 emissions. The
        advantage of IPGCC over conventional boiler plants for CO2
        reduction is that the carbon can be removed from the fuel gas
        (pre-combustion) instead of having to remove it from the exhaust
        (flue) gas (post-combustion), which is far more costly because
        of the larger SCR volume required (about 10:1). </p>
      <p><b>12. Conclusion and general assessment</b> </p>
      <p>The Plasma Torches technology is mature, reliable and a
        well-known method of producing plasma at atmospheric pressure
        and temperatures larger than 5,000 ºC; this may disintegrate all
        mater, in particular solid waste, creating gasification because
        the organic materials are converted in syngas, which is cleaned
        before being used in the Turbine. Magmavication or Vitrification
        is the result of the interaction between plasma and inorganic
        materials, in presence of a coke bed in the cupola or reactor, a
        vitrified material is produced and products are used in the
        manufacture of architectural tiles and construction materials. </p>
      <p>Integrated Plasma Gasification Combined Cycle System (IPGCC)
        generates green electrical power using heavy duty Turbines; the
        heat from the non-transferred electric plasma torch is used to
        gasify the waste, producing a synthetic fuel gas that is then
        cleaned. The cleaned syngas will then be combusted in two simple
        cycle combustion turbines to produce electricity for internal
        consumption, as well as for export to the electric grid. The
        reactor will be designed to handle some liquid waste mixed with
        the solids. The plant is designed for continuous operation,
        twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week and about 330 days
        per year. Although at first look the IPGCC process appears new,
        it is in fact a repackaging of existing, proven technologies. </p>
      <p>To the author's knowledge, the IPGCC plasma process MSW is the
        only environmentally ideal technology that we have today to
        process waste. </p>

        Celsius, hotter than the surface of the sun, said Dr. Louis
        Circeo, principal research scientist in the Construction
        Research Center at Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta. </p>
      <p>The "torch" is basically a 6-foot stainless steel tube with two
        electrodes at one end. Electrical power is applied to the torch
        to produce a flame. The plasma torch program started at Georgia
        Tech in 1990. The plasma torch idea was conceived in 1992. </p>
      <p>In landfills, this technology has the capability of reducing
        the volume of waste by up to 90%. This is achieved by boring a
        hole in the ground and inserting the torch. Depending on how
        many torches are used and how long they are left in the ground,
        a molten pool of a certain diameter is made. As the torch is
        slowly raised, what is left is a rocklike column of molten
        material that is harder than concrete. Because there is no air,
        the material consolidates, giving off gases from the heat.
        Typically, a 10-foot column of waste could be reduced to one
        foot in volume, he explained. </p>
      <p>The technology can also be used to remediate contaminated
        soils. In those cases, a 30-40% reduction can be achieved, he
        said. </p>
      <p>By the proper placement of the holes, the columns can be
        coalesced. All the heavy metals are contained in the pool of
        molten material and any hazardous materials are broken down by
        the heat of the torch to their basic elements. </p>
      <p>"The high heat essentially destroys all the hazardous
        materials. This hard rock is virtually unleachable," Circeo
        pointed out. </p>
      <p>In general, it takes about one megawatt hour of torch power, or
        one torch burning for one hour to melt one ton of soil. To melt
        more soil at one time, you increase the number of torches being
        used, he explained. </p>
      <p>A little more than a year ago, Circeo conducted a research
        project for the state of Georgia using this technology, which
        worked very well in the laboratory. He is now attempting to
        receive a grant from the Environmental Protection Agency to put
        his torch to work at a landfill in Lumpkin County, GA. The grant
        would be used to determine the actual feasibility of adapting
        this technology to the landfill, Circeo said. </p>
      <p>Currently, Circeo has three programs using the plasma torch.
        One is with the U.S. Department of Energy and the Savannah River
        Site, where officials are looking at remediating contaminated
        soils and radioactive and hazardous waste. Another is a
        laboratory study with the Department of Defense, which is
        interested in the technology's application to buried chemical
        and biological waste materials. </p>
      <p>A third project is looking at the stabilization of very weak
        foundation materials for building. It is believed that the
        plasma torch could stop slopes and mud from sliding because it
        would turn subterranean soil into a rock that is harder than
        cement, he said. </p>
      <p>Another benefit Circeo sees from this technology is the
        possibility that useful gases can be extracted from the
        landfills and sold as fuel. "In the laboratory it shows that we
        get as much energy out of the landfill as goes into the plasma
        torch to melt the material in the first place," he added. </p>
      <p>Circeo also has the attention of actor Dennis Weaver, who today
        is involved in environmental matters. Weaver and his Institute
        of Ecolonomics in Colorado were invited to view the laboratory
        study. He was so impressed by the demonstration he has rallied
        behind the effort for funds to conduct a trial and is sending a
        letter to the EPA under his institute's name. Circeo is trying
        to obtain funding from the EPA and the military to conduct field
        studies. </p>

      <p>Marvin with Acme Disintegrator -- “County officials looked
        forward to vaporizing their entire landfill — 4.3 million tons
        of trash collected since 1978. They estimated that it all will
        be gone in 18 years.” </p>
      <p>Wired News1 carried an excellent Associated Press article (Sep,
        09, 2006) that a Florida county waste treatment facility expects
        to vaporize 3,000 tons of garbage a day using lightning-like
        plasma arcs to turn trash into gas and rock-like material.
        According to Geoplasma, the Atlanta-based company building and
        paying for the $425 million facility in St. Lucie County, no
        byproduct will go unused. “Supporters say the process is cleaner
        than traditional trash incineration.” </p>
      <p>Synthetic, combustible gas produced in the process will be used
        to run turbines to create electricity — about 120 megawatts a
        day — that will be sold back to the grid. The facility will
        operate on about a third of the power it generates, free from
        outside electricity. About 80,000 pounds of steam per day will
        be sold to a neighboring Tropicana Products facility to power
        the juice plant’s turbines. </p>
      <p>Sludge from the county’s waste water treatment plant will be
        vaporized, and a material created from melted organic matter —
        up to 600 tons a day — will be hardened into slag, and sold for
        use in road and construction projects. </p>
      <p>“This is sustainability in its truest and finest form,” said
        Hilburn Hillestad, president of Geoplasma, a subsidiary of
        Jacoby Development. </p>
      <p>Such diversified efficiency, i.e., investing in energy from
        waste, certainly seems a more sustainable strategy than
        continued dependence upon oil or natural gas fired generation
        for peak load management. But, will it be safe? </p>
      <p>It would appear from the Wired News article that the plasma-arc
        gasification facility in St. Lucie County uses a one-step
        high-temperature path. This is similar in approach to coal-based
        gasification systems used by Shell, Uhde, Future Energy, Chemrec
        and others; gasification pushes the feedstock straight up to
        1,300ºC. </p>
      <p>No emissions are released during the closed-loop gasification,
        Geoplasma says. The only emissions will come from the synthetic
        gas-powered turbines that create electricity. Even that will be
        cleaner than burning coal or natural gas. “Few other toxins will
        be generated, if any at all,” Geoplasma says. </p>
      <p>Critics disagree with Geoplasma’s claim that “emissions will
        likely be less than from a standard natural-gas power plant.” In
        regard to the St. Lucie County facility, Monica Wilson of the
        Global Alliance for Incinerator Alternatives said what this blog
        previously had noted, there unfortunately is little yet
        published about dealing with sewage sludge as a feedstock. </p>
      <p>One of the challenges is to scrub pollutants from the “syngas”
        before burning it in a gas turbine. (Exhaust heat from the gas
        turbine makes steam to drive another turbine.) Such processing
        is expensive to install, operate correctly, and maintain within
        specifications. Still, if such efforts are successful, then
        gasification of municipal solid waste promises
        near-zero-emissions and extraordinarily high levels of
        efficiency. </p>
      <p>Wilson stated her conviction that county residents need to
        start asking the tough questions. Monitoring is critical because
        of the variability of NOx emissions. Not only must gas scrubbing
        remove 96% to 99% of all particulate matter and tar aerosols,
        but the entire process also must ensure: </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Destruction of all pathogens, viruses, and
        organochlorinated compounds. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Immobilization of heavy metals in waste water
        residuals. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Significant reduction in odor problems. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; 4. No threat of groundwater contamination. </p>
      <p>Wilson is worried because other companies have tried and
        failed. She cited two similar facilities run by different
        companies in Australia and Germany that closed after failing to
        meet emissions standards. Furthermore, “we’ve found projects
        similar to this being misrepresented all over the country.” </p>
      <p><b>Jefferson County Landfill</b> </p>
      <p>Americans generated 236 million tons of garbage in 2003, about
        4.5 pounds per person, per day, according to the latest figures
        from the Environmental Protection Agency. Roughly 130 million
        tons went to landfills — enough to cover a football field 703
        miles high with garbage. </p>
      <p>Wilson has a tough fight because of the economics involved. St.
        Lucie County won’t pay a dime. Geoplasma expects to recoup its
        $425 million investment, funded by bonds, within 20 years
        through the sale of electricity and slag. The company even has
        assumed full responsibility for interest on the bonds. </p>
      <p>County Commissioner Chris Craft said the plasma process “is
        bigger than just the disposal of waste for St. Lucie County. “It
        addresses two of the world’s largest problems — how to deal with
        solid waste and the energy needs of our communities,” Craft
        said. “This is the end of the rainbow. It will change the
        world.” </p>
      <p>Economies of scale are important when one considers how to make
        a difference with renewable energy sources. Some
        waste-management facilities have burned trash to produce
        electricity for quite some time. Other have begun converting
        methane — created by rotting trash in landfills — to power. This
        blog previously relayed an observation by Jamais Cascio: Imagine
        if every municipal waste treatment plant could produce power. </p>
      <p>“Municipal solid waste is perhaps the largest renewable energy
        resource that is available to us,” said Louis Circeo, director
        of Georgia Tech’s plasma research division, adding that the
        process “could not only solve the garbage and landfill problems
        in the United States and elsewhere, but it could significantly
        alleviate the current energy crisis.” He said that if large
        plasma facilities were put to use nationwide to vaporize trash,
        they could theoretically generate electricity equivalent to
        about 25 nuclear power plants. In addition, as landfill fees
        increase, landfill diversion becomes more economical. Biomass
        conversion technologies have the potential to return a
        significant portion of this post-recycled fraction of the waste
        stream to an economic stream in the form of biofuel, electric
        power, heat and / or cooling plus new bioproducts. </p>
      <p>Plants operating in Japan, where emissions standards are more
        stringent than in the U.S., are producing far less pollution
        than regulations require. “For the amount of energy produced,
        you get significantly less of certain pollutants like sulfur
        dioxide and particulate matter,” said Rick Brandes, chief of the
        Environmental Protection Agency’s waste minimization division. </p>

      <p><b>Abstract</b> -- A method is disclosed in which a plasma arc
        torch is used to vitrify and remediate a site containing
        contaminated soils, resulting from a hazardous material deposit
        or spill, or contaminated buried objects. The contaminated
        earthen material or subterranean deposit is pyrolyzed, melted or
        solidified by the plasma torch which is energized at the bottom
        of a cased, vertical borehole, and then gradually raised to the
        surface. An array of boreholes, appropriately spaced, will
        remediate an entire mass of contaminated material. Similarly,
        buried objects such as metal drums containing contaminants and
        underground storage tanks may be selectively remediated at their
        specific buried depth. Similar use is made of the plasma torch
        in a second embodiment with the additional step of processing at
        selected underground locations in the borehole array to create a
        sealed horizontal layer, vertical cutoff walls or a sealed basin
        as a barrier against further leaching of contaminants into
        surrounding soil and groundwater. Gaseous by-products of the
        pyrolysis process are collected, treated and processed, as
        appropriate. </p>

      <p><b>Abstract</b> -- The process of the present invention serves
        to remediate and reduce the volume of waste materials in a
        landfill site and increases the useful life of the treated
        landfill. The process steps involve drilling a series of holes
        into the waste material mass at proper spacing, inserting and
        operating a plasma arc torch in each drilled hole to pyrolize,
        remediate and vitrify the waste materials and allowing the
        melted materials to cool and harden. During the process, a
        gaseous by-product is produced and collected in a hood which is
        attached to scrubbing and chemical cleaning apparatus. The
        resultant gases are commercially useful as fuel gas and the
        vitrified residue is significantly smaller in volume than the
        original waste material volume, thus substantially extending the
        useful life of the landfill site and ultimately providing a firm
        foundation for construction. </p>

        lowered in a shaft into the deposit and serves as a means for
        supplying heat to the coal and thereby stripping off the
        volatiles. The fixed carbon is gasified by reaction with steam

      <p><b>Abstract </b>-- A method is disclosed in which a plasma arc
        torch is used to vitrify and remediate a site containing
        contaminated soils, resulting from a hazardous material deposit
        or spill, or contaminated buried objects. The contaminated
        earthen material or subterranean deposit is pyrolyzed, melted or
        solidified by the plasma torch which is energized at the bottom
        of a cased, vertical borehole, and then gradually raised to the
        surface. An array of boreholes, appropriately spaced, will
        remediate an entire mass of contaminated material. Similarly,
        burled objects such as metal drums containing contaminants and
        underground storage tanks may be selectively remediated at their
        specific buried depth. Similar use is made of the plasma torch
        in a second embodiment with the additional step of processing at
        selected underground locations in the borehole array to create a
        sealed horizontal layer, vertical cutoff walls or a sealed basin
        as a barrier against further leaching of contaminants into
        surrounding soil and groundwater. Gaseous by-products of the
        pyrolysis process are collected, treated and processed, as
        appropriate. </p>
