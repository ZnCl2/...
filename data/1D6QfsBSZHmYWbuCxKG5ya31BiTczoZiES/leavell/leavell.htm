      If any one thing symbolizes crass materialism heaping wanton
      destruction of the environment, that one thing is a jackhammer
      loudly bashing cement or stone, sending chips flying in clouds of
      dust to proclaim, "This is the price of progress".<br>
      <br>
      That raucus imagery may soon vanish from the American scene. No,
      the vital tooll will not become extinct -- merely improved.<br>
      <br>
      Charles Haynes leavell died last year at the age of 69, but his
      life's work lives on and epitomizes the great American dream of
      successful invention.<br>
      <br>
      The genius of Charles Leavell brought forth a vibrationless and
      soundless jackhammer that actually does a more efficient job
      without wear and tear on the ooperator, other equipment or the
      environment.<br>
      <br>
      The Leavell principle, conceived in 1935, patented in 1966 and
      finally made into a production model last year, opens tremendous
      new vistas in pneumatic technology. it may even lead to
      super-efficient engines.<br>
      <br>
      The need for such improved equipment is obvious to people in the
      industry. The new genus of jackhammers will provide the following:<br>
      <br>
      Energy conservation -- The VAST ( vibrationless and soundless
      tools) jackhammers, rock breakers and drill stopers will deliver
      more impact with far less energy consumption.<br>
      <br>
      Durability, low maintenance -- Standard airhammer machinery
      vibrates itself and all attached equipment so violently that
      costly serrious maintenance problems arise almost immediately.
      VAST equipment puts less stress on metals and moving parts.<br>
      <br>
      Lower costs -- VAST equipment has half as many parts, thus
      manufacture and assembly are far less expensive.<br>
      <br>
      Evironmental consideration -- VAST equipment emits very little
      sound in constrast with today's jackhammers which are
      environmental villains of the first order.<br>
      <br>
      It all started back in 1935 when mailman Charley leavell stopped
      to watch some laborers wrestling with their jackhammers. His
      fertile mind mused about a more humane way to break cement.<br>
      <br>
      He thought he could find an easier way and began to ask questions.
      "What you have in mind is against the laws of science", he was
      told by an engineer.<br>
      <br>
      Charley was the kind of guy that grew more interested if someone
      said that something "couldn't be done". For the rest of his life
      he developed a reputation as a quality, if not peculiar, inventor
      who took on "improbable" assignments.<br>
      <br>
      In 1941 he organized Mechanical Research Corporation and sold
      stock in order to finance his ventures. During WW2 he worked with
      Sir Hubert Wilkins on a highly secret project. They were
      developing a huge undersea "tanker" submarine, which would sneak
      supplies across the oceans. The war ended before the project was
      comleted and Charley went back to jackhammers.<br>
      <br>
      By 1955 he had mad a few rough models and was trying to approach
      the various equipment manufacturers, but he was afraid of
      disclosure without protection so serious talks were impossible.<br>
      <br>
      In 1966 he obtained his first patents, then in 1874 his "ultimate
      model" was finished and patented.<br>
      <br>
      The VAST corporation was formed and today it is headed by Floyd R.
      Anderson of Bella Vista AK. Anderson is an expert in metallurgy
      adn formerly an executive with Gardner-Denver, a firm that
      manufactures pneumatic equipment.<br>
      <br>
      Hal Thompson of West Chicago IL is the corporate vice-president
      and he supplied Exchange with comparison table showing the
      advantages of the VAST jackhamer with a standard, heavy-duty tool.<br>
      <br>
      "Our tool is lighter by several pounds, but the weight of the gad
      (point for breaking rock) is more than twice as heavy", Thompson
      explained.<br>
      <br>
      The VAST model D has 24 parts, the standard machines have 42 or 44
      parts.<br>
      <br>
      It takes 100 pounds of air pressure per square inch to drive the
      standard airhammer. The VAST tool is propelled by exactly that
      amount. It requires 84 cubic feet of air per minute to drive the
      standard tools, but only 21 cubic feet per minute for the VAST.<br>
      <br>
      One of the key differences is that Charley's system utilized heat
      and didn't exhaust it with a loud bang. The air input temperature
      in the VAST system is 210 degrees farenheit, while standard
      equipment uses a cool 80 degrees.<br>
      <br>
      It takes a 25 horsepower plant or motor to power standard hammers;
      the model D can do more work at higher speed with a little 5-hp
      compressor.<br>
      <br>
      Engineering firms have worked diligently to make these comparisons
      accurate and the projected fuel savings in one year if 100,000
      airhammers were converted to the VAST model would be about 375
      million barrels of fuel.<br>
      <br>
      "Sound engineers measured the noise output of our system compared
      to the standard system and the relative noise in absolute terms
      shows that an unmuffled jackhammer would be ranked 100; a muffled
      jackhammer would then rank at 17, which is still loud. Ours ranks
      3.13", Thompson said.<br>
      <br>
      Exchange witnessed a demonstration where the receptionist, wearing
      a white skirt, was asked to perform a task that heretofore
      required strong men. She had&nbsp; no difficulty breaking through
      a 16" slab of concrete.<br>
      <br>
      "Normally a jackhammer takes about 50 pounds of push from the
      operator, ours takes a maximum of 35 pounds", Thompson stressed.<br>
      <br>
      The problems of exhaust freeze, exhaust fog, and excess dust
      cannot occur with VAST equipment.<br>
      <br>
      The vibrationless operation is based upon two key points in
      Charley's system. Anderson explained it this way:<br>
      <br>
      "There is a constant air pressure between the piston hammer and
      the housing throughout the stroke; powering the down stroke of the
      piston but resulting in no variable forces being imparted to the
      tool or the operator holding the tool.<br>
      <br>
      "The system then allows a variable air pressure, powering the
      upstroke of the piston which works simultaneously on equal areas
      of the lower face of the piston and the upper face of the breaker
      point.<br>
      <br>
      "Because of the equal areas, the forces are confined to the hammer
      being urged in an upward direction thus preparing for another
      downstroke and the breaker point being urged downward against the
      rock or concrete.<br>
      <br>
      "This concept utilizes all of the compression forces and
      compression heat invested in the equipment."<br>
      <br>
      What Charley Leavell did was design a system that works a reversal
      of the standard compression cycle. He utilized the heat factor and
      thereby eliminated the noisy exhaust.<br>
      <br>
      The impact of the leavell principle on industry will be immense.
      VAST engineers have already computed applications to all sorts of
      industrial tools with variable levels of pneumatic energy and
      frequency.<br>
      <br>
      "We already have programmed the design for a 2000 foot pound
      boulder breaker which delivers eight times the impact of our model
      D, but weighs only one-fourth what a standard tool of the same
      output would weigh", Thompson said.<br>
      <br>
      With all of the advantages it has, one would think industry would
      be climbing all over itself to put the VAST system into
      production. Such is not the case.<br>
      <br>
      Naturally the manufacturers of the standard pneumatic equipment
      equipment don't want to put themselves out of business or totally
      retool, so they are resisting the change.<br>
      <br>
      "The industry has not been receptive, but we are negotiating with
      several firms and Charley's system will be going to work whether
      those already making tools join or not", Thompson added.<br>
      <br>
      "Charley really did have a better idea", Thompson remarked. "Do
      you know that with vibration problems solved it's possible to
      develop an automobile engine that is 68.2% efficient rather than
      the present 18 to 23 % efficiency?"<br>
      <br>
      Charley Leavell's vibrationless technology is coming of age at a
      time when the world seems to be shaking in its boots with energy
      and pollution problems begging for solutions.<br>
      <br>
      His tool offers all the advantages, does the work faster and more
      efficently than the loud, violent equipment but conserves energy
      adn considers the environment. Says something for the strong,
      silent types, doesn't it?<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Abstract </span>-- A pneumatic
      system includes a pneumatic motor, which may take the form of a
      vibrationless paving breaker utilizing a blow-striking member or
      hammer that is propelled to and from its force-transmitting or
      blow-striking position by a compressed gas. A valving arrangement
      provides for relatively large-ratio expansion of the compressed
      gas in the space under the hammer between its infeed thereinto and
      its exhaustion therefrom, in order to significantly utilize heat
      energy in the compressed gas to assist in energizing the
      propulsion of the hammer. Such heat energy is usually invested in
      the compressed gas by and during substantially adiabatic
      compression thereof at a gas-volume transformer, or compressor,
      included in the pneumatic system. It may be noted that the process
      of substantially adiabatic compression in the compressor is to a
      significant degree reversely duplicated in energizing the
      propulsion of the hammer.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">1. Field of the Invention</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      This invention relates generally to a pneumatic motor
      actuationally utilizing the compressionally induced heat energy of
      a gas substantially adiabatically compressed by a compressor
      specialized so that compression of gas therein will approximate
      ideal adiabatic compression, and more specifically, this invention
      relates to such a motor and compressor combination wherein the
      motor has the form of a percussive tool, which may be a
      vibrationless paving breaker.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">2. Description of the Prior Art</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Over the preceding years, the present applicant has devoted much
      time and effort and has made many important inventions, some of
      which can be truly classified as "breakthrough" inventions,
      relating to the production of vibrationless pneumatic tools, such
      as paving breakers. (The term "vibrationless" as employed herein
      refers to the complete elimination of both sensible and
      theoretical casing vibration in a tool effectively utilizing a
      blow-striking element therein.) A number of these inventions have
      been patented, and reference may be made to the following U.S.

      issued Dec. 13, 1966; and <span style="font-weight: bold;">3,295,614</span>,
      issued Jan. 3, 1967. Of particular interest is U.S. Pat. No. <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">3,200,893</span>, in which an
      exhaustive discussion of the principles involved in applicant's
      production of vibrationless pneumatic tools is presented.<br>
      <br>
      Apart from applicant's own efforts, as exemplified to some degree
      by the patents identified above, the vibration referenced emphasis
      in the field of pneumatic percussive tools has been upon reduction
      of vibration, in contradiction to the complete elimination of
      vibration sponsored by applicant in his basic approach.
      Accordingly, while applicant's approach results in completely
      vibrationless operation, the other prior art approaches have, at
      best, merely reduced the degree of practically occurrent
      vibration, which still remains at a very undesirable high level.<br>
      <br>
      In prior art percussive tools, both vibrating and vibrationless,
      the actuating compressed gas (normally compressed air) is
      delivered to and utilized in the tool at a temperature in the
      vicinity of the ambient temperature. Therefore, there has been a
      very costly loss of potentially available actuating energy, due to
      the technologically traditional discarding of the heat energy
      produced in and during compression of the gas, by design
      deliberately directed to avoiding expansion of the compressed gas
      in the tool, thus rendering the system inherently inefficient.<br>
      <br>
      As an informing quantitative illustration of this fact, attention
      is directed to the long-existing extreme contrast between the
      usefully transmitted mechanical-power results of actuative
      investments, respectively, of 100 mechanical horsepower, in an
      electrical generator for reclamation by and after copper wire
      delivery to electric motors, and in an air compressor for
      reclamation by and after conduit or hose delivery to pneumatic
      motors, the electric-motor-reclaimed mechanical power
      approximating 90 horsepower as against pneumatic-motor-reclaimed
      mechanical-power values usually in, and sometimes falling below,
      the range between 10 and 20 horsepower. An, because of the
      illustrative emphasis given herein to pneumatic motors in the
      particular form of hand-held pneumatic paving breakers, it is of
      interest to note that, in prior art pneumatic mechanical-power
      transmission systems consisting of compressor and hose components
      supplying compressed air to motor components of this particular
      form, the pneumatically transmitted mechanical power output
      resulting from such a 100-horsepower input normally does not
      exceed this astonishingly low 10-horsepower value, and not
      infrequently, in cases of field work with old and worn compressor,
      hose, and tool components, may decline to 8 or even to 6
      horsepower.<br>
      <br>
      It is not too much to say that this order-of-10 disparity between
      the corresponding overall efficiencies of such electric and
      pneumatic mechanical-power transmission systems, thus respectively
      approximating 90% and 10%, is the principal reason for the prior
      and contemporary failure of such pneumatic systems
      (notwithstanding their great special advantages in completely
      eliminating the fire and shock-hazard factors normally attending
      the use of the electric systems, and also in affording motor
      components that are uniquely superior in the respects of
      work-output/weight, work-output/size, and work-output/cost ratios)
      to generally replace such electric systems in the shop and factory
      market therefor which, contemporaneously and on a world sales
      basis, is approaching one-and-a-half billion dollars per year.<br>
      <br>
      As a variant and purely qualitative expression of this very
      suggestive information, it is expected that the elimination of
      this existing order-of-10 inferiority of pneumatic
      mechanical-power transmission system efficiencies to electric
      mechanical-power transmission system efficiencies resulting from
      the practical equating of such pneumatic system efficiencies to
      such electric system efficiencies by the breakthrough achievements
      herein disclosed will result (inevitably, in view of the great
      special advantages of such pneumatic over such electric systems
      parenthetically recited in the preceding paragraph) in the
      commencement of so great an enlargement of world use of such
      pneumatic systems in shop and factory and in various other and
      actually much more extensive spheres of practical application
      therefor as to fully justify description of such very great
      enlargement of pneumatic power transmission use as constituting
      the innovation of a long overdue Pneumatic Age.<br>
      <br>
      The foregoing remarks relevant to the employment of compressors to
      produce gaseous pressures for, and therefore adequate for, the
      practically useful actuation of pneumatic motors, illustratively
      and particularly in the form of pneumatic percussive tools, yet
      more particularly represented by vibrationless hand-held-pneumatic
      paving breakers, and especially relevant to and emphasizing the
      very low overall pneumatic efficiency of a typical system, made up
      of a compressor, a practically useful form of pneumatic motor, and
      a hose delivering actuating gas thereto at a pressure raised above
      ambient value by the compressor component of the system, and
      purposefully and successfully designed in accordance with the
      traditional technical ideal of avoiding expansion of the actuating
      gas in such motor component of the system, quite strongly suggest
      the desirability, at this point in explaining the background of
      the invention, of more particularly explaining how this
      traditional but mistaken ideal, principally responsible for
      delaying innovation of such Pneumatic Age throughout the first
      century of the history of the compressor and pneumatic tool
      industry, could ever have come to be adopted by it as its ruling
      principle of thermodynamic design.<br>
      <br>
      In this connection it will be readily understood that, because
      early compressor types were heavy and only inconveniently portable
      between different particular working sites on any extensive
      project area, the use of relatively long hoses to connect easily
      hand-portable pneumatic tools to such inconveniently movable
      compressors, being the obvious alternative to frequently
      undergoing the inconvenience of moving the compressors, very early
      and widely became customary practice in project areas where
      compressor, hose, and pneumatic tool systems were being
      practically applied.<br>
      <br>
      It was then found that the rate of heat transfer, through the
      walls of such long hoses and between compressed air flowing
      therein and ambient air, was generally sufficient to cause
      delivery of such compressed air, to the tool to be actuated
      thereby and regardless of its temperature of entrance into the
      remote other end of the hose connected to the compressor, at a
      temperature only unimportantly different from the temperature of
      the casing and interior of the tool being maintained by contact
      with ambient air approximately at ambient temperature. And under
      these conditions it was readily determined that the horsepower
      requirement for operating the compressor to deliver compressed air
      to the tool at any chosen actuating pressure and thus unavoidably
      at approximately ambient temperature, and at any specific
      pounds-per-minute rate in order to obtain a desired work-rate from
      the tool, could be significantly reduced by purposeful design of
      the compressor to reduce the disparity between the actual
      compression process and ideal isothermal compression at the
      ambient temperature.<br>
      <br>
      A corollary to the general acceptance of this objective of design
      was a passive and continuing general acceptance of the described
      condition of delivery of the actuating compressed air to the tool
      at approximately ambient temperature, which in turn imposed the
      still generally accepted prohibition on design that it not permit
      substantial expansion of the actuating compressed air in the tool
      which would so reduce the temperature of such air in passing
      through the tool as to produce highly objectionable degrees of
      refrigeration therein. In recent years, one of the leading
      compressor and pneumatic tool manufacturers published a list of 14
      impairments of tool operation which such refrigeration in the tool
      would usually or could sometimes produce. As examples, a not very
      extreme degree of refrigeration would result in liquefaction of
      the moisture content of the compressed air into water streaking
      and breaking the oil film on the internal cylinder surface of the
      tool, leading to rapid wear and impaired hammer-piston seal on
      cylinder surface areas thus deprived of effective oil lubrication,
      while more extreme degrees of such refrigeration could destroy all
      lubricative action, and therefore prevent free sliding
      hammer-piston motion, by solidifying the oil film, and, under
      certain atmospheric conditions, would stop operation of the tool
      entirely by converting moisture content of the compressed air into
      an ice plug completely blocking the exhaust port of the tool.<br>
      <br>
      And this generally accepted prohibition against expansion, of the
      compressed air in the tool, by preventing reclamation by it of the
      major investment of mechanical energy in compressing air to a
      smaller volume in the compressor (called the energy of
      compression), limits the mechanical energy obtained by the tool
      from compressed air passing through it to the minor investment of
      mechanical energy made by the compressor piston (called the
      pumping energy) in pumping compressed air out of the compressor
      cylinder, without further reduction of the volume thereof, into
      and against the compressed air pressure effective through the
      receiver and/or hose.<br>
      <br>
      In brief, then, the century-old commitment of the compressor and
      pneumatic tool industry to not reclaiming the much larger energy
      of compression in the tool, but instead actuatively employing in
      it only the much lesser pumping energy, is the principal reason
      for the continued survival of the hereinbefore specified,
      astonishingly low, overall pneumatic mechanical-power transmission
      efficiencies of the order of 10%.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      The present invention improves upon applicant's prior art
      vibrationless pneumatic tools and obviates the inherent
      inefficiency of all prior art pneumatic systems. Although the
      preferred embodiment disclosed herein is that of a vibrationless
      pneumatic paving breaker, it should be recognized that reference
      to the paving breaker or specific features thereof will be
      generally applicable to all vibrationless percussive tools covered
      hereby, as well as frequently applying to the field of pneumatic
      motors generally.<br>
      <br>
      In the preferred embodiment disclosed herein, the vibrationless
      pneumatic paving breaker has a generally cylindrical outer casing
      with an annular cross-section. A central round bar or rod is
      located in and coaxial with the casing, and a generally
      cylindrical blow-striking member or hammer having an annular
      cross-section is positioned for reciprocable motion along the
      round rod within the casing. A generally annular shoulder is
      located on the inner surface of the casing intermediate the ends
      thereof. The hammer or blow-striking member slides along the
      shoulder during its reciprocable motion. One end of the
      blow-striking member or hammer is adapted to engage a work member
      (tool bit or work bit). Adjacent the end of the hammer that
      contacts the tool bit, there is located an annular projecting
      portion that engages the inner surface of the casing with a
      sliding fit. A compressed gas (usually air) actuating chamber is
      formed in the space between the projecting portion and the
      shoulder. An appropriate conduit is utilized to insert compressed
      gas into the actuating chamber.<br>
      <br>
      A cavity is formed in the end of the round rod adjacent the work
      bit. The round rod and this cavity both extend into the work bit
      itself. A portion of this cavity in the work bit, and in the part
      of the rod adjacent the work bit, is enlarged to accept a valve
      assembly, the mounting arrangement and spring bias for which are
      located in the work bit. This enlarged portion of the cavity has a
      control opening at the bottom of the hammer and a vent opening in
      the work bit. The valve assembly interacts with the control
      opening to regulate passage of actuating compressed air to and
      venting (in order to exhaust the actuating gas) of the space under
      the hammer. A compressed air passageway is located at the other
      end of the cavity. This compressed air passageway opens into an
      annular chamber formed in the hammer, which is connected to the
      actuating chamber by another passageway, for a short length of the
      hammer.<br>
      <br>
      Inasmuch as the work bit is free to move with respect to the
      casing, it is necessary to provide for holding the work bit in
      conjunction with the casing. To achieve this, a restraining
      device, such as somewhat resilient restraining arms engaging the
      work bit and passing over the other end of the tool, may be
      utilized.<br>
      <br>
      By appropriate actuation of the valve assembly, a short burst or
      pulse of compressed air at a temperature above ambient temperature
      is inserted under the hammer where it expands to drive the hammer
      away from the work bit. Appropriate regulation of the duration of
      this burst of compressed air results in the hammer being driven to
      the end of the casing away from the work bit, at which point the
      momentum of the hammer is offset by the pressure of the compressed
      gas in the actuating chamber. The heat energy in the gas provides
      the energy of expansion. The hammer is then driven toward the work
      bit by the compressed air in the actuating chamber, while the
      valve assembly is appropriately positioned to vent the space under
      the hammer to atmosphere in order to exhaust the expanded air.<br>
      <br>
      In this fashion, a vibrationless pneumatic tool is provided in
      which the hammer acts against a constant force produced by the
      compressed gas in the actuating chamber in transmitting an
      external force against the casing, and in which actuation of the
      hammer during the motion away from the work bit (return stroke or
      up-stroke), may be easily and accurately controlled. In addition
      to vibrationless operation, this tool also virtually eliminates
      exhaust noise, since the exhaust is achieved at ambient
      temperature and pressure. In view of the very small number of
      parts required to construct this device, a vibrationless pneumatic
      tool has been provided which not only operates in an effective and
      easily controlled fashion, but which is also very practical for
      manufacturing purposes.<br>
      <br>
      The vibrationless pneumatic tool described above works very
      efficiently by utilizing the heat developed during compression of
      the gas to aid in driving the tool, as opposed to conventional
      discarding of this heat energy. In other words, by a substantially
      adiabatic compression of the gas from ambient temperature and
      pressure, with a substantially adiabatic expansion and cooling of
      the gas in the tool, effective utilization of the heat energy is
      achieved. To achieve these desired results, it is desirable to
      insulate the tool to permit the desired adiabatic expansion. Of
      course, with such an arrangement the work output of the tool is
      increased, and hence even if an adiabatic compressor is not
      available, it may be desirable to utilize a heated compressed gas,
      such as by utilizing an after heater with a conventional
      compressor.<br>
      <br>
      In order to achieve the desired adiabatic compression, a very
      significant step forward in the art has been achieved by the
      development of the adiabatic compressor disclosed herein. While
      primary emphasis shall be placed upon the utilization of this
      device as an adiabatic compressor, it should be recognized that
      the device will work equally well as an adiabatic expansion
      arrangement or pneumatic motor, and, therefore, it has been termed
      an adiabatic gas-volume transformer. As a matter of fact, it
      should be noted that the pneumatic tool itself serves as an
      adiabatic expansion device or pneumatic motor, and hence is a
      particularized form of the adiabatic gas-volume transformer.<br>
      <br>
      In the preferred embodiment of the adiabatic gas-volume
      transformer disclosed herein, which is shown in its utilization as
      a compressor, a movable member or piston is mounted for
      reciprocable motion in a casing. A first portion of the piston is
      arranged to move in a gas mass confining area or energy conversion
      chamber to vary the volume of the gas therein. In the preferred
      embodiment disclosed herein, the energy conversion chamber has a
      generally cylindrical shape with a hemispherical end, which
      matches the shape of the casing, but, of course, various other
      shapes could also be utilized. Heat migration or heat loss
      preventing steps are required to prevent heat loss from the energy
      conversion chamber during operation of the gas-volume transformer.
      Any appropriate type of heat migration preventing approach may be
      utilized, such as a very high speed of operation, but in this
      preferred embodiment, the heat migration preventing structure
      involves insulating material placed about the first portion of the
      piston and in the casing about the energy conversion chamber.<br>
      <br>
      An appropriate valving arrangement is required to control the flow
      of gas to and from the energy conversion chamber. In this
      particular example, two valves are utilized, one of such valves
      providing a conduit to the atmosphere, with the other valve
      providing a conduit to a reservoir or tank of heated compressed
      gas. Any appropriate type of control for these valves may be
      utilized, such as a cam arrangement, but in the case of compressor
      operation, appropriate biasing springs may be utilized to yield
      the desired control.<br>
      <br>
      A second portion of the piston is arranged to have a sliding fit
      with the inner surface of the casing. This second portion is
      integrally connected to the first portion, and to a piston drive
      shaft which extends in the opposite direction from the first
      portion of the piston. The second portion of the piston provides
      support for the piston and contains piston or retaining rings for
      carrying lubricant during operation of the transformer. In order
      to reduce the friction losses as much as possible, it is desirable
      to eliminate the side thrust experienced by the second portion of
      the piston. To achieve this, an appropriate guide structure, such
      as a spider arrangement, positions the piston drive shaft. The
      piston is then reciprocated through mechanical energy applied to
      the drive shaft, such as by a double-throw crank arm arrangement.
      The guide or spider structure also permits the first portion of
      the piston to move in the energy conversion chamber without
      contacting the surface thereabout, although being in very close
      proximity thereto.<br>
      <br>
      By utilization of the structure disclosed herein, a very small
      portion of the heated gas in the energy conversion chamber is in
      the vicinity of the piston rings at the point of maximum
      temperature in the transformer (i.e., when the piston has
      decreased the gas containing volume of the energy conversion
      chamber to its greatest extent). This permits cooling of the gas
      in the vicinity of the piston rings without affecting the
      temperature of the gas in the highest temperature or active area
      of the energy conversion chamber. This is achieved by a suitable
      cooling means, such as a water bath located in the casing, which
      also cools the piston rings during the entire extent of their
      motion. This is very important, as the very high temperatures that
      may be reached in the energy conversion chamber can otherwise
      vaporize the lubricant, such as oil, utilized in connection with
      the second portion of the piston.<br>
      <br>
      Therefore, a very efficient pneumatic tool system is provided. As
      part of the system, an extremely efficient adiabatic gas-volume
      transformer has been introduced, so that the hitherto
      unapproachable dream of 100% efficiency from initial mechanical
      energy input to ultimate mechanical energy output is substantially
      realized.<br>
      <br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE
        PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      With reference now to FIGS. 1-3, a vibrationless pneumatic tool 21
      constructed in accordance with the present invention is disclosed.
      While this invention is in no way limited thereto, the preferred
      embodiment of the pneumatic tool 21 disclosed herein is that of a
      paving breaker. Hence, the pneumatic tool 21 shall also be
      interchangeably referred to herein as a pneumatic paving breaker
      or paving breaker 21.<br>
      <br>
      Paving breaker 21 has an outer casing 23, to which are attached
      handles 25 and 27. Casing 23 is any suitable strong material,
      usually a metal and usually steel, while handles 25 and 27 also
      require a strong material, again frequently steel. Handles 25 and
      27 are securely affixed to casing 23 to support the weight of the
      operator bearing thereupon during operation. Handles 25 and 27 may
      be located at any appropriate place on casing 23, but the location
      shown in FIG. 1 is particularly useful for this type of tool. As a
      result of the elimination of vibrations, and the location of
      handles 25 and 27, the operator may lean his chest upon the top of
      the paving breaker 21 to exert a greater force on casing 23 with
      less effort than in conventional devices, where the handles are
      located near the top of the paving breaker. It should also be
      noted that handles 25 and 27 have ball-like protruberances 29 at
      the outermost ends thereof, as this type of structure has been
      found to be more easily grasped by an operator than conventional
      handles.<br>
      <br>
      A central round rod 31 extends along the central axis of casing 23
      and is coaxial therewith. Round rod 31 includes a heat portion 33
      that closes one end of the casing 23. The head portion 33, and
      hence the round rod 31, may be integrally formed with casing 23 or
      integrated therewith by any suitable method, such as by welding in
      a fashion that does not distort the casing 23. The other end 35 of
      round rod 31 extends beyond the other end of casing 23.<br>
      <br>
      A cavity 37 is formed in round rod 31 and extends a predetermined
      distance inwardly from end 35 of the rod. The cavity 37 includes a
      relatively small diameter portion 39 and a somewhat larger
      diameter portion 41.<br>
      <br>
      A valve assembly 43 is located in the enlarged portion 41 of
      cavity 37. Valve assembly 43 includes a valve body 45 with a valve
      stem 47. A bias spring 49 is connected to a base 51 attached to
      valve stem 47. A screw member 53 mounts the valve assembly 43 in
      portion 41 of cavity 37, with bias spring 49 extending over a leg
      54 of member 53. Threads 55 on screw member 53 mate with
      corresponding threads 57 on end 35 of round rod 31. Therefore,
      during assembly of the tool, the valve assembly 43 may be inserted
      into portion 41 of cavity 37 for mounting therein by the screw
      member 53.<br>
      <br>
      The valve body 45 is moved with respect to a series of control or
      adjusting openings 59, which selectively supply an actuating
      compressed gas to a blow-striking member, or hammer, 61 and vent
      the space under the hammer 61. The control or actuating openings
      59 are spaced about the circumference of the round rod 31 in any
      desired number, although in this preferred embodiment a total of
      four actuating openings 59 have been found suitable. The bottoms
      of actuating openings 59 are aligned with the top of a work member
      (also referred to herein as a work bit or tool bit) 63, when the
      tool 21 is in the operative position illustrated in FIGS. 5-13.
      The tool bit 63 has a neck 65 which is inserted into casing 23.<br>
      <br>
      The end 35 of round rod 31 extends into the work bit 63. Vent
      openings 67, generally corresponding to the actuating openings 59,
      extend from portion 41 of cavity 37 to a chamber 69 formed in work
      bit 63. Passageways 71 connect chamber 69 to ambient conditions,
      normally atmospheric. Grooves 73 formed in a shoulder 75 of work
      bit 63 provide top portions of passageways 71. Another vent
      opening 77 connects cavity 37 with chamber 69 to provide venting
      of the space about stem 35 of rod 31 during the at-rest or standby
      position of FIG. 4, since the upward movement of casing 23 results
      in vent openings 67 being blocked off from chamber 69 by work bit
      63.<br>
      <br>
      In the standby condition, valve body 45 is biased to the top of
      portion 41 of cavity 37 by the spring 49. A frusto-conical portion
      79 of valve body 45 mates with a shoulder 81 at the top of portion
      41 to limit the extent of movement of valve body 45 in that
      direction. In this position, the space between the top of neck 65
      of work bit 63 and the bottom of hammer 61 is vented through
      openings 59, along valve stem 47 to openings 67, through chamber
      69 and passageways 71 to atmosphere. When compressed air is
      inserted into portion 39 of cavity 37, through openings or
      passageways 83, valve body 45 is moved against the force of spring
      49 to permit the compressed air to pass through openings 59 and
      under hammer 61 to drive the hammer 61 away from work bit 63. At
      the same time, the vent path previously described is blocked. In
      this fashion, the valve body 45 selectively permits compressed air
      to be inserted into the space under hammer 61, or causes that
      space to be vented or exhausted to ambient or atmosphere.<br>
      <br>
      The hammer 61 is a generally cylindrical body with an annular
      cross-section and is formed of a suitably hard material to deliver
      blows to the work bit 63. An actual blow-delivering face 85
      strikes a blow-receiving surface 87 on the top of neck 65 of work
      bit 63. Blow-delivering face 85 is the outermost extension of an
      enlarged portion 89 of the hammer 61. In order to increase the
      surface exposed to compressed air at the time that face 85 bears
      against surface 87, radial grooves 91 may be formed in face 85. In
      addition, a frusto-conical surface 93 is formed at the inner
      bottom of portion 89 to provide a surface for the compressed air
      to bear against at the time that face 85 and surface 87 are in
      contact, as well as during the return or up-stroke of hammer 61.<br>
      <br>
      A chamber 95 in the hammer 61 is connected to compressed gas
      through openings or passageways 97. Seven such openings or
      passageways 97 have been found preferable, although any suitable
      number may be utilized. The compressed gas inserted through
      openings or passageways 97 comes from an actuating chamber 99 that
      is formed between enlarged portion 89 on hammer 61 and a
      projecting shoulder 101 formed on the inner surface of casing 23.
      The outer surface 103 of hammer 61 is adapted to pass through
      shoulder 101 with a tight sliding fit. Similarly, the outer
      surface 105 of enlarged portion 89 of hammer 61 is adapted to ride
      along the inner surface 107 of casing 23 with a tight sliding fit.
      Thus, the variable volume actuating chamber 99 is provided.
      Appropriate seals (not shown) may be utilized to insure that there
      is no gas leakage from actuating chamber 99. Compressed gas is
      passed to actuating chamber 99 from a suitable source 109 thereof
      through a line 111 to an opening 113 in casing 23. In this
      preferred embodiment, compressed gas is provided to the tool 21 at
      temperature somewhat in excess of 200.degree. Fahrenheit, so that
      the gas may be expanded and the heat energy in the compressed gas
      utilized to drive the hammer 61, and thus greatly increase the
      efficiency of the pneumatic system. The heat energy in the
      compressed gas from source 109 may be developed by means of an
      adiabatic compressor of the type disclosed hereinafter, or by any
      other suitable means, such as a conventional approximately
      isothermal compressor with an after-heater.<br>
      <br>
      At the end of the hammer away from enlarged portion 89, there is
      located an opening 115 that has frusto-conical portions 117 and
      119 and a connecting cylindrical portion 121. When the hammer 61
      approaches the head portion 33 at the top of casing 23, the
      surface about cylindrical portion 121 engages a shoulder 123 on
      round rod 31, while the surface of portion 117 approaches a
      shoulder 125, also on round rod 31. The engagement between the
      surface of cylindrical portion 121 and shoulder 123 is a tight
      sliding fit, so that a gas-tight space is formed between the
      surface of portion 117 and shoulder 125. This provides a gas or
      air cushion that prevents the hammer 61 from stroking against the
      casing 23 with a metal to metal contact.<br>
      <br>
      The space 126 above the hammer 61 is vented to atmosphere at all
      times by openings 127, so that no pressure is developed above
      hammer 61, except for the gas cushion between the surface of
      frusto-conical portion 117 and shoulder 125. Again, any
      appropriate number of openings 127 may be utilized, but it has
      been found that forty such openings provide the desired amount of
      venting in this embodiment. Although these forty openings are not
      specifically disclosed in FIGS. 1-3, schematic representations
      thereof are shown in FIGS. 1 and 2.<br>
      <br>
      The work bit 63 has the neck 65 thereof positioned in casing 23
      for reciprocable motion therein. When casing 23 is urged toward
      work bit 63, the shoulder 75 of the work bit 63 bears against a
      resilient member 129 connected to the bottom of casing 23.
      However, when work bit 63 is struck by the hammer 61, the work bit
      63 may be driven away from casing 23 so that shoulder 75 no longer
      bears against resilient member 129. In some cases, the separation
      could become great enough that the work bit would become
      completely separated from the casing 23, thus causing loss of
      operating ability with, perhaps, attendant damage to the tool 21.
      Also, the work bit 63 would become separated from tool 21 during
      the standby or at-rest condition. Therefore, a restraining device
      131 is utilized to prevent work bit 63 from separating too far
      from casing 23. Restraining member 131 has a pair of somewhat
      resilient arms 130 and 132, each of which has a hook-type end
      members 133, which fit in corresponding slots 135 in the tool bit
      63. As tool bit 63 is driven away from casing 23 by the impact of
      a blow, or by cessation of the force exerted by the operator on
      casing 23, the end members 133 engage the surface 137 at the tops
      of slots 135 to limit the amount of separation between the work
      bit and the casing.<br>
      <br>
      In order to prevent rotation of the work bit 63 during operation,
      the restraining member passes through a structure 139 on the
      casing 23, which holds the restraining member arms 130 and 132
      from twisting. Structure 139 includes a pair of holding members or
      ears 138 and 140 on opposite sides of casing 23.<br>
      <br>
      A suitable fastening device, such as a bolt-like portion 141, may
      be utilized to secure the restraining member to the top of casing
      23. Threaded portion 141 is integrally connected to the
      restraining member 131. Threads 143 on the bolt-like portion 141
      mate with corresponding threads 145 in head portion 33 of round
      rod 31. To attach or disattach restraining member 131 from tool
      21, arms 130 and 132 are spread to the position illustrated in
      FIG. 3 and the whole member 131 is rotated. With the resilient
      arms 130 and 132 released to return to the position of FIG. 1 or
      FIG. 2, the restraining member 131 is locked on tool 21 and held
      by ears 138 and 140 and the sides of grooves 135.<br>
      <br>
      While the structure of the tool 21 disclosed herein could be
      utilized with an actuating compressed gas at ambient temperature,
      the operation of the tool is premised upon the expansion of the
      gas under hammer 61, and thus heat would have to be provided to
      prevent a refrigerating effect. The most efficient way to
      accomplish this, which also tremendously increases systems
      efficiency, is to utilize the heat energy produced during
      compression of the gas. Accordingly, in the preferred embodiment,
      the source of gas 109 would be a substantially adiabatic
      compressor. The heated compressed gas would then be conveyed to
      tool 21, such as by a short hose or conduit 111. Hose 111 is
      preferably formed to prevent heat migration or loss, such as by
      use of an inner gas conveying tube 147 and an outer tube 146. The
      air space therebetween will provide the desired insulation. Of
      course, with such an insulated hose 111, the length thereof can be
      increased to any desired length.<br>
      <br>
      One of the major difficulties with a heated actuating gas is that
      the lubricant in the tool may be vaporized. In the preferred
      embodiment disclosed in FIGS. 1-3, the gas is used at a low enough
      temperature to preclude vaporization of the oil or other
      lubricant. Also, the tool 21 may be operated without insulation,
      but in a desirable form rubber insulation 149 may be utilized.
      Such a rubber coating on casing 23 prevents heat loss and also
      permits use of a thinner-walled casing 23, due to the greater
      resiliency provided by rubber coating 149.<br>
      <br>
      By reference now to FIGS. 4-13, the operation of the pneumatic
      tool disclosed herein may be followed in detail. With reference to
      FIG. 4, the tool is shown in the at-rest or standby position. It
      may be seen that work bit, 63 is spaced from the casing 23 by a
      gap 148, which is the maximum amount of separation permitted by
      the restraining member 131. As shown, the hooked end portions 133
      of the restraining member 131 engages the top surfaces 137 of
      grooves 135 to limit the separation of tool bit 63 from resilient
      member 129 of casing 23. (For purposes of the views of FIGS. 4-13,
      the restraining member 131 is only illustrated in fragmentary
      detail.) At this point, the chamber 95 is below the passageway 83,
      so that no compressed gas bears against valve body 45. Hence, the
      spring 49 maintains the valve body 45 at the maximum distance away
      from the work bit 63 (with section 79 abutting shoulder 81).<br>
      <br>
      In FIG. 5, the tool 21 is put into an operative state by an
      operator putting force against casing 23 to bring the resilient
      member 129 into contact with tool bit 63. In this position, the
      chamber 95 in the hammer 61 is aligned with passageway 83, so that
      compressed air from the actuating chamber 99 is conveyed to cavity
      37 and forces valve body 45 to the position shown, against the
      force of bias spring 49. In this position, the valve body 45
      blocks the openings 59 from the atmosphere and permits the
      compressed gas to enter under hammer 61. The initial effect on the
      hammer 61 during the return or up-stroke is aided by the grooves
      91 and the frusto-conical surface 93. The openings 127 serve, of
      course, to vent the space 126 above hammer 61 to ambient or
      atmosphere at all times, so that there is no compression of the
      air in that space to impede the hammer on its return stroke, other
      than the small air cushion at the end of the return stroke.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 6 depicts the hammer 61 as being propelled upwardly so that
      chamber 95 is no longer in association with passageway 83. Thus,
      no more compressed gas is being conveyed to the cavity 37. The
      length of chamber 95 is carefully determined, and based upon the
      speed of the hammer 61 on the return stroke, so that the pulse or
      slug of compressed air applied to the relatively large surface 85
      at the bottom of hammer 61 supplies just enough energy to carry
      the hammer to the end of return stroke position, against the force
      exerted by the compressed gas in chamber 99 against a surface 150
      of enlarged portion 89 of hammer 61. As the chamber 95 has just
      separated from passageway 83, the valve body 45 is still in the
      position of FIG. 5.<br>
      <br>
      In FIG. 7, the hammer 61 is approaching the end of the return
      stroke (top-of-stroke) position and is slowing down pursuant to an
      imminent change in the direction of momentum. The valve body 45
      has now moved to the position that it completely closes openings
      59, so that the only gas or air under hammer 61 is the initial
      pulse of compressed gas that was inserted at the beginning of the
      return stroke. This pulse of gas is expanding to propel the hammer
      61, with the heat energy in the compressed gas providing the
      energy of expansion in order to permit the gas to be exhausted at
      ambient temperature and pressure, which eliminates exhaust noise,
      as well as providing a very efficient operation.<br>
      <br>
      The view of FIG. 8 illustrates the hammer 61 at the end of return
      stroke, or top-of-stroke, position. The pulse of compressed air
      that was inserted under the hammer has now expanded and cooled to
      approximately the value of these parameters for the ambient (or
      atmospheric) conditions. In the event that the pulse of compressed
      air provided too much energy, the gas cushion between the surface
      of the frusto-conical area 117 and the shoulder 125 will preclude
      any direct contact between the hammer 61 and the casing 23. At
      this point the spring 49 has urged valve body 45 slightly above
      the openings 59, so that the space under hammer 61 is now vented
      to ambient or atmospheric conditions by the path through openings
      59, along valve stem 47, through openings 67 to chamber 69, and
      thence to atmosphere through passageways 71. Therefore, as the
      hammer begins its blow striking or downward stroke under the force
      exerted by the compressed air in actuating chamber 99, there will
      be no compression of the gas under the hammer, as this space is
      vented to atmosphere for exhausting the expanded gas to
      atmosphere. The blow striking or down stroke of hammer 61 will
      exhaust the space below it, but as the gas in the space is
      expanded and cooled to atmospheric conditions, the gas being
      exhausted will already be at or near atmospheric conditions.<br>
      <br>
      During the initial states of the blow-striking stroke, the valve
      body 45 continues to be urged away from work bit 63 by spring 49,
      until it reaches the farthest extent of this motion as shown in
      FIG. 9. At this point, the openings 59 are completely opened to
      provide the venting of the space under hammer 61, as previously
      described. From the position shown in FIG. 8 to that shown in FIG.
      10, the hammer 61 is propelled on the blow-striking stroke by the
      compressed gas in actuating chamber 99 and, in the case of a
      paving breaker, by the force of gravity. At the position of FIG.
      10, the passageways 97 have come into gas conveying position with
      respect to actuating chamber 99, but chamber 95 has not just come
      into conjunction with openings 83, so that valve body 45 remains
      at the extreme position under the force of spring 49.<br>
      <br>
      Continued movement to the position of FIG. 11 results in chamber
      95 beginning to come into confluence with openings 83 to pass
      compressed gas to cavity 37. However, the relationship shown has
      just been reached, so that the pressure in cavity 37 has not yet
      been raised sufficiently to displace valve body 45 against the
      force of spring 49. By the time that the position of FIG. 12 has
      been reached, which is the point at which the hammer 61 comes into
      blow-striking contact with work bit 63, the chamber 95 has been
      brought into conjunction with the openings 83 to drive the valve
      body 45 against the force of spring 49. However, as the conveying
      of compressed air to cavity 37, and hence against valve body 45,
      has not caused openings 59 to be closed, these openings still
      serve to vent the area under hammer 61 to prevent any lessening of
      the energy conveyed from hammer 61 to work bit 63. A short time
      later, though, as illustrated in FIG. 13, the compressed air in
      cavity 37 has resulted in the valve body 45 being moved to close
      openings 59 as a vent and to open them for the insertion of
      actuating compressed air. Since hammer 61 has struck work bit 63
      and is ready to repeat the cycle of operation just described, it
      may be seen that a constant force has been maintained against
      hammer 61 by the compressed gas in actuating chamber 99, which
      transmits the force from casing 23 when that casing has a force
      applied to it that is sufficiently great to maintain the resilient
      member 129 on casing 23 in contact with work bit 63. An energizing
      propulsion is achieved by applying the same constant pressure
      compressed gas to a larger surface on the bottom of the hammer 61
      and permitting it to expand to drive the hammer against the
      constant force produced by the gas in actuating chamber 99.
      Therefore, a vibrationless pneumatically actuated tool is provided
      which is highly efficient and desirably simple in operation and
      construction.<br>
      <br>
      In the description of the pneumatic tool 21, it has been pointed
      out that a greater work output can be achieved if heat energy in
      the compressed gas is also utilized in driving the hammer. This is
      particularly true when the operation of the pneumatic tool is
      considered in conjunction with the operation of the system as a
      whole, wherein the efficiency of the system is greatly decreased
      as a result of discarding the heat of compression in the attempted
      isothermal compression processes conventionally utilized.
      Accordingly, a much more efficient system can be realized if the
      heat of compression is conveyed to and utilized in the pneumatic
      tool. To achieve this highly efficient approach, applicant has
      produced a truly revolutionary adiabatic compressor, the
      principles of which are equally applicable in a reverse flow of
      energy, of which an adiabatic version of the pneumatic tool
      disclosed herein is an example. Therefore, the description of the
      adiabatic compressor disclosed herein is generally applicable to
      the much broader concept of an adiabatic gas-volume transformer
      (i.e., a device in which substantially adiabatic energy transfer
      is achieved in either the form of a compressor or a pneumatic
      motor).<br>
      <br>
      With reference to FIGS. 14, 15 and 16, a preferred embodiment of
      an adiabatic gas-volume transformer 201 may be seen. In FIGS. 15
      and 16, the transformer 201 is depicted in its specialized use as
      an adiabatic compressor, although the principles are equally
      applicable to the generalized version of FIG. 14.<br>
      <br>
      Adiabatic gas-volume transformer 201 has an outer casing or shell
      203. Casing 203 may be formed of any suitable material having the
      requisite structural strength, such as steel. The casing 203 has
      an annular cross-section, generally cylindrical extending portion
      205 and a generally hemispherical end portion 207 at one end
      thereof. It should be recognized that while the preferred
      embodiment utilizes the shape described for the casing 203, this
      invention could also be practiced with casings having modified,
      and even completely different, shapes.<br>
      <br>
      An internal cavity 209 is formed in the casing 203. Cavity 209 has
      the same general configuration as the casing 203. A portion 211 of
      cavity 209 at the hemispherical end of the cavity constitutes a
      gas mass containing space or energy conversion chamber (which is
      the compression chamber in the specific example of an adiabatic
      compressor). Energy conversion chamber 211 is encompassed by
      chamber insulating material 213. Insulating material 213 may be
      any suitable type of insulation that is capable of enduring the
      relatively high pressures and temperatures to which it will be
      subjected in energy conversion chamber 211. In this preferred
      embodiment, a ceramic type of insulating material 213 has been
      utilized. Prevention of heat migration or heat loss may also be
      achieved in any other suitable fashion, such as by very rapid
      actuation of the apparatus.<br>
      <br>
      A movable element or piston 215 is located in cavity 209 and
      arranged for longitudinal reciprocation therein. Piston 215 has a
      first portion 217 insertable into the energy conversion chamber
      211, a second portion 219 from which the first portion 217
      extends, and a piston shaft 221 extending from the other side of
      portion 219. All of the portions of piston 215 are integrally
      connected to form a unitary structure, which is co-axial with
      casing 203.<br>
      <br>
      Portion 217 of piston 215 is shaped to fit into the energy
      conversion chamber 211 at the generally hemispherical end of
      cavity 209. As a matter of fact, this portion 217 actually defines
      the energy conversion chamber when it is at the bottom of stroke
      position shown in FIG. 16. The energy conversion chamber 211 may
      be defined as that portion of cavity 209 which is between the
      hemispherical end of the cavity and the top of portion 219 of
      piston 215, less the space displaced by portion 217 of the piston.
      This definition is made, of course, when the piston 215 is at the
      bottom-of-stroke position (shown in FIG. 16). It may be seen that
      there is an additional space about the circumference of part 217
      between point 223 and portion 219 of the piston, but as this space
      is very small and the gas therein does not become an appreciable
      portion of the gas volume until the top of stroke position is
      reached by piston 215, it could easily be neglected when defining
      the energy conversion chamber 211. However, as the gas volume in
      this space becomes important during the compression stroke at the
      top of stroke position, it must be included as part of energy
      conversion chamber 211.<br>
      <br>
      Portion 217 of piston 215 has a central core 225 of a high
      strength material, such as steel. Core 225 of portion 217 of
      piston 215 has a plug member 227 at the generally hemispherical
      end thereof. Plug member 227 is provided with threads 229 to
      engage corresponding threads in the body of core 225. The purpose
      of plug 227 is to permit the removal of material from the internal
      portion of core 225 to form an opening 231, which extends into
      portion 219 as well. In this way, the piston can be lightened
      without having to bore through the shaft 221, which would tend to
      weaken that shaft. After the opening 231 has been formed, plug
      member 227 is screwed back into the other portion of core 225 to
      form an integral core for the portion 217.<br>
      <br>
      Piston insulating material 233 is located about the outer surface
      of core 225, to the same extent as the insulating material 213, in
      order to prevent any heat loss from the energy conversion chamber
      through piston 215. Insulating material 233 would be any
      appropriate type of insulation, such as a suitable ceramic
      material. Insulation 233 may be more firmly affixed to core 225 by
      the provision of projections 235, about which insulating material
      233 would be formed to provide a more secure connection between
      this insulating material and core 225.<br>
      <br>
      As may be seen, the external dimensions of portion 217 are made
      slightly smaller than the dimensions of cavity 209, so that a
      small gas volume will exist between piston portion 217 and the
      internal wall of casing 203, even when piston 215 is at the top of
      stroke position illustrated in FIG. 15. The spacing between the
      external surface of piston portion 217 and the internal surface of
      casing 203 is very small, on the order of a few thousandths of an
      inch. This small spacing, combined with a strict axial alignment
      of the piston as hereinafter described, is sufficient to keep the
      insulating materials 213 and 233 from bearing against each other,
      which could damage the insulating qualities and cause insulating
      material to accumulate in the energy conversion chamber as a
      result of abrasion.<br>
      <br>
      Portion 219 of piston 215 is adapted to move in cavity 209 with a
      tight sliding fit. Piston or sealing rings 237 are located about
      the periphery of portion 219 to engage the inner surface of casing
      203 that forms the cavity 209. A suitable sealing and lubricating
      medium or agent, such as oil, is in engagement therewith to
      lubricate the sliding engagement between portion 219 of piston 215
      and the inner surface of casing 203, as well as sealing the energy
      conversion chamber 211 to prevent the escape of gases therein. The
      sealing and lubricating medium (oil) will be introduced into
      cavity 209 in any conventional fashion and will be carried by
      piston ring 237. The pressure of the gas in energy conversion
      chamber 211 will prevent the oil from rising above the last piston
      ring 239.<br>
      <br>
      Portions 217 and 219 of piston 215 would ordinarily be integrally
      formed, although any suitable permanent connection of these
      portions would be acceptable. Shaft 221 could also be integrally
      formed with portion 219, but also may be connected in any other
      fashion to provide a solid and permanent interconnection.<br>
      <br>
      Shaft 221 leads into a crank box 241, wherein mechanical energy
      can either be transferred to piston 215 or extracted therefrom. In
      this specific embodiment of a high efficiency adiabatic
      compressor, an appropriate double-throw crank drive (not shown)
      may be utilized to reciprocate the piston 215 upwardly to compress
      the gas in the energy conversion or compression chamber 211.
      Energy is transferred from the double-throw crank drive by linking
      rods 240 and 242, which are strong enough to permit high speed
      operation, if desired. Rods 240 and 242 are connected to shaft 221
      through a linking member 244 by means of appropriate bearings,
      such as needlepoint ball bearings. Member 244 is attached to shaft
      221 by any appropriate method, releasable attachment such as a
      threaded interconnection being desirable for assembly purposes.<br>
      <br>
      In view of the close tolerances between portion 217 of piston 215
      and the internal surface of the casing 203, it is necessary that
      the piston be confined to an extremely accurate co-axial motion
      between piston 215 and casing 203. Such an accurate co-axial
      motion may be achieved by utilizing an appropriate guide for the
      shaft 221, such as a spider structure 243 illustrated in FIG. 14.
      Spider 243 may be either a three or four-legged spider, as
      desired. An internal ring 245 of spider structure 243 provides a
      tight sliding fit with the shaft 221 and must be very accurately
      positioned to insure the co-axiality of the motion of piston 215
      with respect to casing 203.<br>
      <br>
      A cooling jacket or bath 247 is located beyond the end of
      insulating materials 215 and 233, and extends away from the
      generally hemispherical end 207 of the casing.<br>
      <br>
      The temperature at which the sealing and lubricating medium that
      engages piston rings 237 will vaporize is often considerably lower
      than the relatively high temperatures reached in the energy
      conversion chamber 211. For example, it would be likely that the
      lubricant (oil) would have a temperature of vaporization in the
      vicinity of 400.degree. F., while the temperature in the energy
      conversion chamber 211 (at full compression or top-of-stroke)
      could go as high as 6,000.degree. F. Of course, the temperatures
      in the energy conversion chamber 211 could go considerably higher
      than this, but as a practical example, the 6,000.degree. clearly
      illustrates the problem. The cooling jacket 247 maintains a
      relatively low temperature in the vicinity of the piston rings
      237, as well as for a portion of the gas in the energy conversion
      chamber 211 when the piston 215 is at top-of-stroke, as shown in
      FIGS. 14 and 15. A very important feature of this invention, which
      cannot be overemphasized, is the arrangement by which the piston
      rings 237 have been displaced from the vicinity of the extremely
      high temperatures reached in the energy conversion chamber 211, as
      well as by the arrangement for cooling the gas volume in the
      energy conversion chamber that is adjacent to the piston rings
      237.<br>
      <br>
      The cooling jacket or bath 237 may be either located about casing
      203, or set in the casing, as shown in this preferred embodiment.
      This cooling jacket or bath will normally utilize water as the
      coolant, although other liquid or gaseous cooling mediums could be
      used equally well.<br>
      <br>
      While this description has been on rather generalized terms that
      relate to an adiabatic gas-volume transformer, reference has been
      made to the specific preferred embodiment disclosed herein of an
      adiabatic compressor. Thus, the particular spring-biased valve
      assemblies 251 and 253 may be employed, rather than the more
      generalized arrangement of FIG. 14, which would be a cam
      arrangement although such a cam arrangement could also be utilized
      for the specific embodiment of an adiabatic compressor. In valve
      assembly 251, a compression spring 255 is connected to a valve
      stem 257. The other end of valve stem 257 is connected to a valve
      head 259, which is forced against a valve seat 261 by compression
      spring 255. Valve stem 257 passes through a valve body 263, which
      is attached to an appropriately threaded flange 265 of casing 203.
      A valve chamber 267 is formed between the valve body 263 and the
      valve head 259. An opening 269 brings valve chamber 267 into
      communication with the atmosphere. When valve head 259 is lifted
      off valve seat 261, the space between valve head 259 and valve
      seat 261, the valve chamber 267 and opening 269 form a conduit
      from energy conversion chamber 211 to the atmosphere.<br>
      <br>
      The valve assembly 253 has a tension spring 271 attached to a
      valve stem 273, which has a valve head 275 at the other end
      thereof. Valve head 275 engages a valve seat 277 to seal the
      energy conversion chamber 211 from a valve chamber 279. A line 281
      leads from valve chamber 279 to a tank 280 in which gas at a
      relatively high pressure and temperature is stores. Tank 280 is
      preferably insulated, such as by a layer of insulation 282.
      Although shown in spherical form, tank 280 could, of course, have
      any appropriate shown shape. Also, the line or conduit 281 is also
      preferably insulated to prevent loss of heat energy.<br>
      <br>
      When valve head 275 is separated from valve seat 277, the space
      between valve head 275 and valve seat 277, valve chamber 279 and
      line 281 provide a flow path between the energy conversion chamber
      211 and the gas storage tank 280. As in the case of valve assembly
      251, valve assembly 253 has a valve body 283 through which the
      valve stem 273 passes. Valve body 283 is connected to an
      appropriate threaded flange 284 on casing 203. In the cases of
      both compression spring 255 and tension spring 271, the spring is
      fastened to the respective valve body. In the case of tension
      spring 271, the spring is connected to valve body 283 by clamps
      285, while in the case of compression spring 255, the spring is
      connected to valve body 263 by clamps 287.<br>
      <br>
      At the bottom-of-stroke position illustrated in FIG. 16, valve
      head 275 firmly engages valve seat 277. Valve head 259 is forced
      against valve seat 261 by the relatively weak compression spring
      255. Although valve head 259 has been separated from valve seat
      261 by the vacuum produced in energy conversion chamber during the
      down-stroke, the relatively weak compression spring 255 suffices
      to move valve head 259 to the position shown in FIG. 16 at the
      bottom of the stroke. This is because at the bottom-of-stroke
      position the pressure in energy conversion chamber 211 has reached
      atmospheric level, due to the blow path through opening 269, valve
      chamber 267 and the space between valve head 259 and valve seat
      261. On the other hand, valve head 275 is held in the closed
      position against valve seat 277 by the pressure of the gas in
      valve chamber 279 that passes through line 281, as well as by the
      vacuum created in energy conversion chamber 211 during the
      down-stroke.<br>
      <br>
      As piston 215 is moved upwardly, the gas in energy conversion
      chamber 211 is compressed so that the pressure and temperature
      thereof increase. The increased pressure against valve head 259
      keeps valve assembly 251 in the closed condition, so that energy
      conversion chamber 211 is sealed from the atmosphere. Valve
      assembly 253 remains in the closed position, as the force due to
      the pressure of the gas in chamber 211 against the inner surface
      of valve head 275 is not sufficiently great to overcome the
      combined force due to the pressure of the gas in valve chamber 279
      against the surface of valve head 275 in that chamber and that of
      the tension spring 271.<br>
      <br>
      As piston 215 reaches the top of stroke position illustrated in
      FIG. 15, the pressure and temperature of the gas in energy
      conversion chamber 211 reach the levels that are desired for the
      gas that is to be transmitted through line 281. At this point the
      high pressure of the gas in chamber 211 that bears against the
      inner surface of valve head 275 is sufficiently great to open the
      valve as shown, to permit the gas in energy conversion chamber 211
      to pass through line 281 to the storage tank. As soon as the gas
      in energy conversion chamber 211 has been transferred through line
      281 to the storage tank 280, valve head 275 will be moved to the
      closed position against valve seat 277. At this point, the system
      is ready for the down-stroke of piston 215. During the
      down-stroke, valve head 259 will be moved to the open position
      away from valve seat 261, as previously explained. At the same
      time, valve head 275 will be held firmly against valve seat 277 by
      the pressure of the gas in valve chamber 279 and the force of
      spring 271, with the strength of the seal being further enhanced
      by the vacuum formed in energy conversion or compression chamber
      211. Therefore, the gas having a relatively high temperature and
      pressure in the storage tank connected to line 281 will not be
      permitted to escape into the energy conversion chamber 211. At the
      bottom-of-stroke position, the valve head 259 will move to the
      closed position and the sequence of operation previously described
      will be reinitiated.<br>
      <br>
      As previously explained, one of the significant features of this
      invention that makes the system operative is the procedures taken
      for insuring that the lubricating and sealing medium (oil)
      engaging piston rings 237 is not vaporized by the heat generated
      during the compression of the gas. This is achieved by two steps:
      (1) increasing the physical separation between the piston rings
      237 and the area where the gas reaches its highest temperature
      (i.e., adjacent to the hemispherical portion of the cavity 209);
      and (2) cooling the gas that is closest to the piston rings 237.
      This latter step is achieved by making the insulation 213 in the
      casing 203 and the insulation 233 on portion 217 of piston 215
      terminate at point A, while the gas extends to point B. Thus, the
      gas in the volume of energy conversion chamber 211 between points
      A and B is subjected to the cooling influence of the cooling
      jacket 247, both through casing 203 and piston portion 219.
      Assuming that the temperature at point A is the same as the
      temperature in the hemispherical portion of the energy conversion
      chamber 211, a temperature gradient between points A and B must be
      achieved that will reduce the temperature of the gas at point B so
      that it is below the temperature of vaporization of the sealing
      and lubricating medium. Due to the very thin film of gas that is
      in this volume, the cooling effect of the water jacket 247 is more
      than sufficient to provide the desired temperature gradient. It
      should be noted that, as a practical matter, the temperature at
      point A will probably be somewhat less than the maximum
      temperature in the energy conversion chamber 211, but as the
      indicated method of protecting the sealing and lubricating medium
      from high temperatures suffices even in the worst case, the fact
      that actual conditions might result in less of a temperature
      gradient between points A and B enhances the significance of this
      approach.<br>
      <br>
      While the preferred embodiment disclosed herein is that of an
      adiabatic compressor, it should be recognized that the adiabatic
      gas-volume transformer may be equally well utilized to provide
      mechanical power in the fashion of a pneumatic motor. In such an
      arrangement, the gas at a relatively high pressure and temperature
      would be inserted into the energy converting chamber 211 through
      the valve assembly 253 to drive the piston on the down-stroke.
      During this down-stroke of the piston, the valve assembly 251
      would be in the closed position. On the return stroke of the
      piston, which would be the up-stroke, valve assembly 251 would be
      open, while the valve assembly 253 would be closed. Obviously, the
      spring arrangements shown in FIGS. 15 and 16 would not be suitable
      for such a purpose, and a cam control of the type shown in
      generalized form in FIG. 14, or some other appropriate type of
      control, would have to be utilized.<br>
      <br>
      Another interesting and very important concept that is involved in
      the dual nature of the adiabatic gas-volume transformer is that by
      utilizing the transformer as a compressor to drive the transformer
      utilized as a pneumatic motor, it is possible to produce
      efficiencies in practice that are close enough to the theoretical
      maximum efficiency of 100% to make such a pneumatic power
      transmission system very desirable. In this regard, it should be
      noted that the paving breaker tool described herein may be
      regarded as a particularized form of the adiabatic gas-volume
      transformer utilized as a pneumatic motor. Accordingly, use of the
      adiabatic compressor disclosed herein with the pneumatic paving
      breaker disclosed herein provides a highly efficient pneumatic
      system, as well as the freedom from vibration and other desirable
      characteristics of the paving breaker tool previously set forth.<br>
      <br>
      With reference now to FIGS. 17-19, a somewhat schematicized form
      of a pneumatic tool is illustrated in which the use of the
      adiabatic gas-volume transformer for transferral of energy in a
      direction opposite to that involved in compression (i.e., as a
      pneumatic motor) is disclosed. In the embodiment of FIGS. 1-13, a
      relatively low temperature is utilized for the heated compressed
      gas. As the temperature is below the vaporization temperature of
      the lubricant, there is no necessity of isolating the lubricant
      from the actuating gas. However, in the embodiment of FIGS. 17-19,
      much higher temperatures are involved, so that it is necessary to
      protect the lubricant.<br>
      <br>
      The tool 301 of FIGS. 17-19 has an outer casing 303, of a material
      such as aluminum, which constitutes a back-up tank. Back-up tank
      303 contains a gas at an elevated pressure, but essentially
      ambient temperature. The utilization of such a back-up tank to
      keep a constant pressure force applied is disclosed in detail in
      U.S. Pat. No. 3,266,581--Cooley et al.<br>
      <br>
      An inner casing 305, which is provided with an insulating layer
      307, has a movable member or piston 309 therein. Piston 309 has a
      part 311 thereof which serves as the blow-striking member or
      hammer. The other portion 313 of piston 309 has piston or sealing
      rings 315 which are adapted to contact the inner casing 305 with a
      sliding fit. Piston rings 315 convey a lubricant, such as oil,
      which forms a film from the top of casing 305 to the bottom of
      portion 313 of piston 309 at the position shown in FIG. 17. The
      hammer 311 has a diameter somewhat less than that of portion 313,
      and thus does not contact the casing 305.<br>
      <br>
      The hammer 311 strikes against an anvil 317, which can either be a
      portion of the work bit or a separate member driven to strike the
      work bit. A first conduit 319 provides for the insertion of heated
      compressed gas (air), while a second conduit 321 provides for
      venting or exhausting the space between hammer 311 and anvil 317.
      Appropriate valve systems (not shown) would control the opening
      and closing of these conduits. It should be noted that the
      pressure of the gas inserted through conduit 319 is at a greater
      pressure than the constant pressure of the gas applied to the top
      surface of piston 309 from back-up tank 303, so that the piston
      can be raised against the constant force.<br>
      <br>
      For purposes of this discussion, it shall be assumed that the
      compressed air inserted through conduit 319 has a pressure of 232
      psia and a temperature of 542.degree. Fahrenheit. The ambient air
      shall be assumed to be at 15 psia and 70.degree. F.<br>
      <br>
      At the position shown in FIG. 17, a pulse of the compressed air is
      inserted through conduit 319. This pulse will have a time duration
      such that the energy contained therein has been calculated to
      raise piston 309 to the position shown in FIG. 19, during
      expansion thereof, against the constant force of the compressed
      gas from back-up tank 303. As the heated compressed gas is
      inserted into the casing 305, the temperature of hammer 311 will
      be raised to 150.degree.. Since the oil film only comes to the
      bottom of portion 313 of the piston 309, it is not exposed to the
      542.degree. of the incoming compressed gas, but only to a
      temperature of 155.degree..<br>
      <br>
      As the gas expands and raised piston 309 to the position shown in
      FIG. 18, the gas also cools. The decrease in temperature and
      pressure is illustrated for the bottom of hammer 311 in FIG. 19.
      In the position of FIG. 18, the bottom of hammer 311 is at the
      level of the lowermost boundary of the oil film (i.e., at the
      point of the bottom of portion 313 in FIG. 17). From the chart in
      FIG. 19, it may be seen that the maximum temperature to which the
      oil film would be exposed would be 294.degree. F., which would be
      below the temperature of vaporization of the oil. At all other
      points above this, the oil would be exposed to lesser
      temperatures, so that no problem of vaporization would result.<br>
      <br>
      Continued expansion and cooling of the pulse of gas that is
      inserted through conduit 319 raises piston 309 to the position
      shown in FIG. 19. At this point, conduit 321 is open to the
      atmosphere to permit exhaustion of the space below the hammer
      during its downward motion. Since the pulse of air is expanded and
      cooled to ambient conditions, it will be exhausted at this
      pressure and temperature level. Therefore, the reverse operation
      of the adiabatic gas-volume transformer is readily recognized, and
      it may be seen that all of the energy in the heated compressed gas
      has been transferred to the piston 309, which is now prepared to
      release that energy in delivering a blow to the work bit under the
      constant force of the compressed gas from back-up tank 303.
      Accordingly, a highly efficient adiabatic system has been
      demonstrated in which the gas-volume transformer can be utilized
      at both ends of the system. Of course, the device illustrated in
      FIGS. 17-19 is rather schematic, but it may be readily recognized
      that the principles disclosed therein can be readily adapted to
      many areas.<br>
      <br>
      It should be understood that various modifications, changes and
      variations may be made in the arrangements, operations and details
      of construction of the embodiment disclosed herein without
      departing from the spirit and scope of this invention.<br>
