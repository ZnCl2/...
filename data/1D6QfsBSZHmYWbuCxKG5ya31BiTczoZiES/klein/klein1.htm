      <p><i>From the news segment</i>: Klein just patented his process
        of converting H2O to HHO, producing a gas that combines the
        atomic power of hydrogen with the chemical stability of water.
        "it turns right back to water. In fact, you can see the h20
        running off the sheet metal." Klein originally designed his
        water-burning engine for cutting metal. He thought his invention
        could replace acetylene in welding factories. Then one day as he
        drove to his laboratory in Clearwater, he thought of another way
        to burn his HHO gas. "On a 100 mile trip, we use about four
        ounces of water." Klein says his prototype 1994 Ford Escort can
        travel exclusively on water [italics mine], though he currently
        has it rigged to run as a water and gasoline hybrid. </p>
      <p>It seems like every 15 years or so some guy comes along and
        claims to have come up with a way to turn water into clean
        burning fuel. (Remember the "Bodine Gasoline" pill from the
        Beverly Hillbillies?) The thing is, any elementary school
        student can turn water into hydrogen and oxygen, which burns
        very nicely, turning back into water when it burns. But I have
        yet to hear of anyone who has come up with a way to turn water
        into hydrogen and oxygen without using more energy than you
        produce. If you had an electrolysis machine that produced more
        energy than it consumed, you could plug it into itself and have
        yourself a perpetual motion machine. </p>
      <p>I couldn't find any claims one way or another on Klien's
        website about the efficiency of the process, but if it isn't
        greater than 100%, then what's the big deal? The welding device
        seems kind of neat, but I've read comments that dismiss these
        kinds of welding torches. </p>

      <p><i>Photo:</i> Denny Klein demonstrates the flame on a welding
        tool powered by a machine that uses water and an electrical
        charge to create fuel. "You get a huge energy response," Klein
        says. "But this gas is very, very safe." </p>
      <p><i>CLEARWATER</i> --- Denny Klein thinks he has found a new
        commercial use for hydrogen technology. </p>
      <p>Working in a small, two-room shop at the Airport Business
        Center, Klein, 63, said he has developed a gas that speeds
        welding and fusing times and improves automobile fuel efficiency
        30 percent. </p>
      <p>Although the technology Klein uses -- electrolysis -- has been
        around for decades, he said it's the form of gas that comes out
        of his electrolyzer and the characteristics of the gas that set
        his hydrogen technology apart. </p>
      <p>Klein's gas is two parts hydrogen and one part oxygen. Sound
        familiar? Yep, it's water. </p>
      <p>Electrolysis is a process that uses an electrical charge in
        water to separate the hydrogen from the oxygen. But coming out
        of Klein's gas generator, the H2O 1500 electrolyzer, it's not
        water, he said. Klein, president of Hydrogen Technology
        Applications Inc., calls it HHO, or the brand name Aquygen. </p>
      <p>"You get a huge energy response," Klein said. "But this gas is
        very, very safe." </p>
      <p>Klein -- who employs eight people, four in Florida, three who
        handle licensing out of Kentucky and his son, Greg, in Ohio --
        is no engineer. The Ohio native attended Ohio State University
        and Capital University in Columbus, Ohio, for business
        administration. </p>
      <p>His aptitude in hydrogen technology came from self-study. He
        has worked alongside engineers in whirlpool spa and suntanning
        businesses, and says he has six employees with doctorates on his
        advisory board. </p>
      <p>Klein said he has a patent pending on the gas he has been
        working on for 12 years. Various models of his H2O electrolyzers
        are being used across the country in high school shop classes
        and undergoing testing to be certified for use in welding shops.
      </p>
      <p>Flipping a switch on his H2O 1500, Klein picks up a hose with a
        metal tip, creates a spark, and instantly a blue and white
        glowing stream shoots out of the metal tip. </p>
      <p>He holds the tip with his fingers to prove how cool it is to
        the touch, unlike such a tip when oxy-acetylene is burned for
        welding. But the instant he sets the flame on a charcoal
        briquette, it glows bright orange. Then, within seconds, he
        burns a hole through a brick, cuts steel and melts Tungsten. </p>
      <p>The temperature of the flame is 259 degrees Fahrenheit. But it
        instantaneously rises to the melting temperature of whatever it
        touches, Klein said. Those temperatures can exceed 10,000
        degrees Fahrenheit. </p>
      <p>"You can't do this with any other gas," he said. </p>
      <p>Klein also has outfitted a 1994 Ford Escort station wagon with
        a smaller electrolyzer that injects his HHO into the gasoline in
        the car's engine. He said he has increased his mileage per
        gallon by 30 percent. </p>
      <p>That also is undergoing testing from the U.S. Environmental
        Protection Agency and other private motorsports companies, Klein
        said. </p>
      <p>Klein said he has 19 projects in the works. </p>
      <p>Ali T-Raissi, director of the hydrogen research and development
        division of the Florida Solar Energy Center, said he is not
        familiar with Klein's HHO or electrolyzer. But he said applying
        hydrogen technology in that way comes at a price. </p>
      <p>T-Raissi said mixing the hydrogen with gasoline will require a
        change in the typical car engine. And creating the gas requires
        electricity, which comes at a cost. </p>
      <p>"You can increase your mileage performance, but you have to
        ask: Am I still ahead, or am I behind?" </p>
      <p>Klein said his formulation of hydrogen doesn't require altering
        an engine. And his electrolyzer cost about 70 cents an hour to
        operate, which he considers a bargain. </p>
      <p>Klein said his method for introducing hydrogen into a vehicle
        to increase mileage is superior to hydrogen used in fuel cells.
      </p>
      <p>One of the biggest challenges facing hydrogen fuel cells is
        storing the gas. To meet today's driving requirements, it would
        take a lot more hydrogen than can now be stored safely in a
        vehicle. Klein's HHO is made on-demand and mixed directly with
        the gasoline in the engine at slightly more pressure than is
        currently there. </p>
      <p>He said he plans to take Hydrogen Technology, which now has
        private investors, public in the first half of 2006.</p>

      <p><b>RELATED APPLICATION</b> </p>
      <p>[0001] This patent application is a divisional application of
        U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/760,336 filed on Jan. 20,
        2004, which is a continuation-in-part application of the U.S.

        Ser. No. 09/826,183 filed on Apr. 4, 2001. </p>
      <p><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>[0002] <b>1. Field of the Invention</b> </p>
      <p>[0003] This invention is related to equipment or a system and
        method for the processing of water or distilled water into a
        gaseous and combustible form of HHO combustible gas produced
        from water for use in internal combustion engine systems, in
        other fossil fuel engine systems, in gaseous welding systems and
        other similar systems. The invention is also related to the form
        of HHO combustible gas produced from electrolyzers or gas
        generators connected to such systems. </p>
      <p>[0004] The field of this patent application has been the
        subject of a rather vast number of patents. Among such prior art
        is U.S. Pat. No. 4,014,777 issued on Mar. 29, 1977 to Yull Brown
        under the title "Welding"; U.S. Pat. No. 4,081,656 issued on
        Mar. 28, 1978 to Yull Brown under the title "Arc assisted
        hydrogen/oxygen welding"; and other similar patents. In
        accordance with the above patents as well as with the subsequent
        rather large literature in the field, "Brown gas" is defined as
        a combustible gas composed of conventional hydrogen and
        conventional oxygen gases having the exact stochiometric ratio
        of 2/3 hydrogen and 1/3 oxygen. As we shall see, the combustible
        gas treated in this invention is dramatically different than the
        Brown gas. </p>
      <p>[0005] The electrolytic equipment and methods for water
        separation have also been the subject of a vast number of
        patents, among which is U.S. Pat. No. 4,726,888 issued Feb. 23,
        1988 to Michael McCambridge, entitled "Electrolysis Of Water;"
        U.S. Pat. No. 5,231,954 issued Aug. 3, 1995 to Gene B. Stowe
        entitled "Hydrogen/Oxygen Fuel Cell"; U.S. Pat. No. 5,401,371
        issued Mar. 29, 1995 to Yujiro Oshima entitled "Hydrogen
        Generator;" and others. </p>
      <p>[0006] The novelty of the present invention over preceding
        prior art is clear and distinct. The prior art deals with
        equipment and methods for the processing of water into
        conventional gaseous fuels, that is, fuels possessing the
        conventional molecular chemical composition or mixture of
        chemical compositions and is sometimes referred to as "Brown's
        Gas". By comparison, the present invention provides equipment or
        a system and related processes (methodology) to produce novel
        fuel composed of a chemical species beyond that of molecules,
        that is, HHO combustible gas, which fuel is produced from water
        using a particular form of electrolyzer. </p>
      <p><b>DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>[0007] This invention deals with the structure, properties and
        initial applications of a new clean burning combustible gas
        hereinafter called "HHO gas" produced from distilled water using
        a special electrolyzer described in detail in the
        Specifications. </p>
      <p>[0008] It will be soon evident that, despite a number of
        similarities, the HHO gas is dramatically different than the
        Brown gas or other gases produced by pre-existing electrolyzers.
        In fact, the latter is a combination of conventional hydrogen
        and conventional oxygen gases, that is, gases possessing the
        conventional "molecular" structure, having the exact
        stochiometric ratio of 2/3 hydrogen and 1/3 oxygen. As we shall
        see, the HHO gas does not have such an exact stochiometric ratio
        but instead has basically a structure having a "magnecular"
        characteristic, including the presence of clusters in
        macroscopic percentages that cannot be explained via the usual
        valence bond. As a consequence, the constituents clusters of the
        Brown Gas and the HHO gas are dramatically different both in
        percentages as well as in chemical composition, as shown below.
      </p>
      <p>[0009] The first remarkable feature of the special
        electrolyzers of this invention are their efficiencies. For
        example, with the use of only 4 Kwh, an electrolyzer rapidly
        converts water into 55 standard cubic feet (scf) of HHO gas at
        35 pounds per square inch (psi). By using the average daily cost
        of electricity at the rate of $0.08/Kwh, the above efficiency
        implies the direct cost of the HHO gas of $0.007/scf. It then
        follows that the HHO gas is cost competitive with respect to
        existing fuels. </p>
      <p>[0010] Under direct inspection, the HHO gas results to be
        odorless, colorless and lighter than air. A first basic feature
        in the production of the HHO gas is that there is no evaporation
        of water at all, and water is directly transmuted into the HHO
        gas. In any case, the electric energy available in the
        electrolyzer is basically insufficient for water evaporation. </p>
      <p>[0011] This feature alone establishes that the special
        electrolyzers of this invention produce a "new form of water"
        which is gaseous and combustible. The main objective of this
        invention is the first identification on record of the produced
        unknown chemical composition of the HHO gas, its relationship
        with the special electrolyzers of this invention, and some
        initial applications. </p>
      <p>[0012] The second important feature of the HHO gas is that it
        exhibits a "widely varying energy content" in British Thermal
        Units (BTU), ranging from a relatively cold flame in open air,
        to large releases of thermal energy depending on its use. This
        is a direct evidence of fundamental novelty in the chemical
        structure of the HHO gas. </p>
      <p>[0013] In fact, all known fuels have a "fixed energy content"
        namely, a value of BTU/scf that remains the same for all uses.
        Also, the variable character of the energy content of the HHO
        gas is clear evidence that the gas has a magnecular
        characteristic in its structure, rather than a molecular
        structure, namely, that its chemical composition includes bonds
        beyond those of valence type. </p>
      <p>[0014] The third important feature of the HHO gas is that it
        does not require any oxygen for its combustion since it contains
        in its interior all oxygen needed for that scope. By recalling
        that other fuels require atmospheric oxygen for their
        combustion, thus causing a serious environmental problem known
        as "oxygen depletion," the capability to have combustion without
        any oxygen depletion renders the HHO gas particularly important
        on environmental grounds. </p>
      <p>[0015] The fourth important feature of the HHO gas is its
        anomalous adhesion to gases, liquids and solids, as verified
        experimentally below, thus rendering its use particularly
        effective as an additive for the enhancement of desired
        qualities. </p>
      <p>[0016] The fifth important feature of the HHO gas is that it
        does not follow the fundamental PVT law of all conventional
        gases (namely, those with molecular structure), since the HHO
        gas begins to deviate from this law at around 150 psi, and it
        reacquires the water state at a sufficiently high pressures
        beginning with 250 psi. These aspects are further being
        investigated for possible development and commercial
        exploitation. </p>
      <p>[0017] The sixth important feature of the HHO gas is that it
        bonds to gaseous fuels (such as natural gas, magnegas fuel, and
        other fuels) and liquid fuels (such as diesel, gasoline, liquid
        petroleum, and other fuels) by significantly improving their
        thermal content as well as the environmental quality of their
        exhaust. </p>
      <p>[0018] The seventh and most important feature of the HHO gas is
        that it melts almost instantaneously tungsten, bricks, and other
        highly refractive substances. In particular, measurements have
        established the remarkable capability by the HHO gas of reaching
        almost instantaneously temperatures up to 9,000 degrees C.,
        namely a temperature of the order of that in the Sun
        chromosphere under which all substances on Earth can be
        sublimated. </p>
      <p>[0019] This invention also involves an electrolyzer for the
        separation of water, which includes, in one embodiment an
        electrolysis chamber; an aqueous electrolytic solution
        comprising water and electrolyte, the aqueous electrolyte
        solution partially filling the electrolysis chamber such that a
        gas reservoir region is formed above the aqueous electrolyte
        solution; two principal electrodes comprising an anode electrode
        and a cathode electrode, the two principal electrodes being at
        least partially immersed in the aqueous electrolyte solution;
        one or more supplemental electrodes at least partially immersed
        in the aqueous electrolyte solution and interposed between the
        two principal electrodes wherein the two principal electrodes
        and the one or more supplemental electrodes are held in a fixed
        spatial relationship; wherein said electrolyzer produces a
        combustible gas composed of hydrogen and oxygen atoms and their
        bonds into chemical species caused by electrons valence bonds
        and the bond due to attractive forces between opposing magnetic
        polarities originating in the toroidal polarization of the
        electron orbitals. Furthermore, the relatively simple design of
        the electrodes--as rectangular or square metallic shapes allows
        for the electrodes to be easily replaced. The combustible gas is
        collected in the gas reservoir region, which is adapted to
        deliver the gas to the fuel system of an internal combustion
        engine. </p>
      <p>[0020] The invention can be used to improve the fuel efficiency
        of an internal combustion engine. The method comprises using any
        of the embodiments of the electrolyzers disclosed herein in
        conjunction with an internal combustion engine. An electrical
        potential is applied to the electrodes of the electrolyzer
        thereby caused the electrolyzer to generate the gas. The gas is
        then combined with the fuel in the fuel system of the internal
        combustion engine before the fuel is combusted in the internal
        combustion engine. </p>
      <p>[0021] In still another embodiment of an electrolyzer, an
        electrolyzer includes an electrolysis chamber which holds an
        electrolyte solution. The electrolysis chamber mates with a
        cover at a flange. Preferably, there is a seal between the
        chamber and cover, which is made from a neoprene gasket, which
        is placed between the flange and cover. The electrolyte solution
        may be an aqueous electrolyte solution to produce a mixture of
        the novel gases; however, to produce the novel inventive gases,
        distilled water preferably is used. </p>
      <p>[0022] The electrolyte partially fills the electrolysis chamber
        during operation to level such that gas reservoir region is
        formed above the electrolyte solution. The electrolyzer includes
        two principle electrodes--anode electrode and cathode
        electrode--which are at least partially immersed in the
        electrolyte solution. Anode electrode and cathode electrode slip
        into grooves in a rack. The rack is placed inside the chamber.
        One or more supplemental electrodes are also placed in the rack.
        Again, the supplemental electrodes are at least partially
        immersed in the aqueous electrolyte solution and interposed
        between the anode electrode and cathode electrode. Furthermore,
        anode electrode, cathode electrode, and supplemental electrodes
        are held in a fixed spatial relationship by rack. Preferably,
        anode electrode, cathode electrode, and supplemental electrodes
        are separated by a distance of about 0.25 inches. The one or
        more supplemental electrodes allow for enhanced and efficient
        generation of this gas mixture. Preferably, there are from 1 to
        50 supplemental electrodes interposed between the two principal
        electrodes. More preferably, there are from 5 to 30 supplemental
        electrodes interposed between the two principal electrodes, and
        most preferably, there are about 15 supplemental electrodes
        interposed between the two principal electrodes. Preferably, the
        two principle electrodes are each individually a metallic wire
        mesh, a metallic plate, or a metallic plate having one or more
        holes. More preferably, the two principle electrodes are each
        individually a metallic plate. A suitable metal from which the
        two principal electrodes are formed, includes but is not limited
        to, nickel, nickel containing alloys, and stainless steel. The
        preferred metal for the two electrodes is nickel. The one or
        more supplemental electrodes are preferably a metallic wire
        mesh, a metallic plate, or a metallic plate having one or more
        holes. More preferably, the one or more supplemental electrodes
        are each individually a metallic plate. A suitable metal from
        which the two principal electrodes are formed, includes but is
        not limited to, nickel, nickel containing alloys, and stainless
        steel. The preferred metal for the two electrodes is nickel. </p>
      <p>[0023] During operation of the electrolyzer, a voltage is
        applied between the anode electrode and cathode electrode which
        causes the novel gas to be produced and which collects in a gas
        reservoir region. The gaseous mixture exits the gas reservoir
        region from through an exit port and ultimately is fed into the
        fuel system of an internal combustion engine. An electrical
        contact to anode electrode is made through a contactor and
        electrical contact to cathode electrode is made by another
        contactor. The contactors are preferably made from metal and are
        slotted with channels such that the contactors fit over the
        anode electrode and cathode electrode. The contactors are
        attached to rods, which slip through holes in the cover.
        Preferable the holes are threaded and the rods are threaded rods
        so that rods screw into the holes. The contactors also hold the
        rack in place since the anode electrode and cathode electrode
        are held in place by channels and by grooves in the rack.
        Accordingly, when the cover is bolted to the chamber, the rack
        is held at the bottom of the chamber. The electrolyzer
        optionally includes a pressure relief valve and a level sensor.
        The pressure relief valve allows the gaseous mixture in the gas
        reservoir to be vented before a dangerous pressure buildup can
        be formed. The level sensor ensures that an alert is sounded and
        the flow of gas to the vehicle fuel system is stopped when the
        electrolyte solution gets too low. At such time when the
        electrolyte solution is low, addition electrolyte solution is
        added through a water fill port. The electrolyzer may also
        include a pressure gauge so that the pressure in the reservoir
        may be monitored. Finally, the electrolyzer optionally includes
        one or more fins which remove heat from the electrolyzer. </p>
      <p>[0024] In a variation of an electrolyzer, a first group of the
        one or more supplemental electrodes is connected to the anode
        electrode with a first metallic conductor and a second group of
        the one or more supplemental electrodes is connected to the
        cathode electrode with a second metallic conductor. The anode
        electrode, cathode electrode, and supplemental electrodes are
        held to the rack by a holder rod, which slips through channels
        in the rack and the holes in the electrodes. The rack is
        preferably fabricated from a high dielectric plastic such as
        PVC, polyethylene or polypropylene. Furthermore, the rack holds
        the anode electrode, cathode electrode, and supplemental
        electrodes in a fixed spatial relationship. Preferably, the
        fixed spatial relationship of the two principal electrodes and
        the one or more supplemental electrodes is such that the
        electrodes (two principal and one or more supplemental) are
        essentially parallel and each electrode is separated from an
        adjacent electrode by a distance from about 0.15 to about 0.35
        inches. More preferably, each electrode is separated from an
        adjacent electrode by a distance from about 0.2 to about 0.3
        inches, and most preferably about 0.25 inches. The fixed spatial
        relationship is accomplished by a rack that holds the two
        principal electrodes and the one or more supplemental electrodes
        in the fixed spatial relationship. The electrodes sit in grooves
        in the rack which define the separations between each electrode.
        Furthermore, the electrodes are removable from the rack so that
        the electrodes or the rack may be changed if necessary. Finally,
        since the rack and anode electrode and cathode electrode are
        held in place as set forth above, the supplemental electrodes
        are also held in place because they are secured to the rack by
        the holder rod. </p>
      <p>[0025] During operation, the novel combustible gas is formed by
        the electrolysis of the electrolyte solution in the
        electrolyzer. The electrolyzer is connected to a collection tank
        by a pressure line. The gases are collected and temporarily
        stored in the collection tank. The collection tank optionally
        includes a pressure relief valve to guard against any dangerous
        pressure build up. The collection tank is connected to a
        solenoid by a pressure line. The solenoid is in turn connected
        by a pressure line to an engine intake manifold. Optionally, a
        flash arrestor is incorporated in the pressure line to prevent a
        flame from propagating in a tube. Furthermore, a pressure line
        also includes an orifice to regulate the flow of the gaseous
        mixture into the intake manifold. The size of this orifice will
        depend on the size of the engine. For example, an orifice
        diameter of about 0.04 is suitable for a 1 liter engine, about
        0.06 inches is suitable for a 2.5 liter engine, and about 0.075
        inches is suitable for a V8 engine. The applied voltage to the
        electrolyzer is provided through the solenoid by an electrolyzer
        battery. When the pressure in the collection tank drops below
        about 25 psi, solenoid switches and a voltage of about 12 V is
        applied between the anode electrode and cathode electrode. A
        battery isolator allows for charging of a vehicle battery and
        electrolyzer battery by an alternator while keeping the
        electrolyzer battery and vehicle battery electrically isolated.
        Furthermore, the solenoid is powered by the vehicle battery when
        the main switch is activated. A gas mixer solenoid is also
        powered by the vehicle battery and opens when the gas mixture is
        provided to the intake manifold. The solenoid also receives a
        feedback from the level sensor which causes the solenoid to shut
        off the gas flow if the electrolyte solution level in the
        electrolyzer gets too low. Finally, when the method and
        apparatus of the present invention are used in a vehicle, the
        operation of the vehicle's oxygen sensor needs to be adjusted to
        take into account the additional oxygen that is added to the
        fuel system from the electrolyzer. Normally, if the oxygen
        sensor senses more oxygen, the vehicle's computer would
        determine that the engine is running lean and open up the fuel
        injectors to a richer fuel mixture. This is undesirable and
        would cause poor fuel economy. </p>
      <p>[0026] In another embodiment of the present invention, a method
        for increasing the fuel efficiency of an internal combustion
        engine is provided. The method of this embodiment utilizes the
        electrolyzer described above in conjunction with an internal
        combustion engine. Specifically, the method comprises providing
        an electrolyzer equipment described above or as further
        described below in other novel embodiments; applying an
        electrical potential between the electrodes wherein the novel
        combustible gas described herein is generated and collected in
        the gas reservoir region and wherein the electrolyzer is adapted
        to deliver the combustible gas to the fuel system of an internal
        combustion engine; and combining the combustible gas produced
        with fuel in the fuel system of an internal combustion engine.
        The step of adjusting the operation of an oxygen sensor as set
        forth above is also provided. </p>
      <p>[0027] In another embodiment, an electrolyzer or gas generator
        is incorporated into a welding/cutting torch system or another
        type of equipment/engine system. This system comprises an
        electrolyte reservoir, having a top and a bottom, containing
        electrolytic fluid therein. The fluid herein is preferably
        water. The electrolyte reservoir comprises a broken or permeable
        plate, which is sealably and circumferentially positioned around
        a top end of the electrolyte reservoir. Plate functions to
        release gas pressure within the electrolyte reservoir when
        exceeding a pre-determined safety level. </p>
      <p>[0028] The self-producing hydrogen and oxygen gas generating
        system further comprises a pump, preferably an electromagnetic
        pump, which is connected at one distal end to the bottom of the
        electrolyte reservoir. Pump is connected at an opposite distal
        end to at least one hydrogen and oxygen electrolyzer/generator
        containing an electrical conductor therein. The electrical
        conductor is electrically connected on one distal end to an
        electrical ground. The opposite distal end of the electrical
        conductor is electrically connected to one distal end of a
        pressure controller. The opposite distal end of the electrical
        conductor is electrically connected to a power source. Pump
        functions to circulate electrolytic fluid from the electrolyte
        reservoir through at least one hydrogen and oxygen
        electrolyzer/generator through a radiator back into the
        electrolyte reservoir via a gas pipe. The radiator functions to
        cool the generated hydrogen and oxygen gas before returning to
        the electrolyte reservoir. </p>
      <p>[0029] The pressure controller is connected to the electrolyte
        reservoir and monitors the pressure therein. When gas pressure
        within the electrolyte reservoir exceeds a pre-determined level,
        electrical current is terminated to the electrical conductor
        contained within the hydrogen and oxygen generator thereby
        ceasing production of hydrogen and oxygen gas. When gas pressure
        within the electrolyte reservoir drops below a pre-determined
        level, electrical current is connected to the electrical
        conductor contained within the hydrogen and oxygen generator
        thereby commencing production of hydrogen and oxygen gas. The
        pre-selected level is less than the pre-selected level required
        to cause a pressure release through plate. </p>
      <p>[0030] This self-producing on-demand hydrogen and oxygen
        generating system further comprises a non-return valve connected
        at one end to an upper end of the electrolyte reservoir below
        plate. The non-return valve is further connected to a
        dryer/filter means or tank at an opposite distal end. </p>
      <p>[0031] System further comprises another filter/dryer means or
        tank in fluid communication with one end of the electrolyte
        reservoir above plate and further connected at an opposite
        distal end to another non-retum valve via gas line, which is
        connected at an opposite end to another filter/dryer means or
        tank. </p>
      <p>[0032] System further comprises a decompression valve in fluid
        communication at one end to the top end of the electrolyte
        reservoir and further being in fluid communication with the gas
        pipe, which in turn is connected to radiator. </p>
      <p>[0033] The welding system further comprises a microprocessor
        controlled D.C. amperage regulator adapted to regulate the D.C.
        amperage from the power source to the hydrogen and oxygen
        generator. A first microprocessor controlled cut-off switch is
        adapted to terminate the power source to the welder in response
        to a malfunction of the pump. </p>
      <p>[0034] A second microprocessor controlled cut-off switch is
        adapted to terminate the power source to the welder in response
        to an insufficient electrolyte solution condition within the
        electrolyte reservoir. A microprocessor controlled liquid
        crystal display is adapted to display operating statistics
        regarding the welding system, such statistics to include hours
        of operation, amperage, indicator lights and pressure gauge
        readings. The liquid crystal display receives input from a
        plurality of locations within the system. </p>
      <p>[0035] A microprocessor controlled polarity change system is
        adapted to change the polarity of the electrical conductor
        located within the hydrogen and oxygen generator. A
        microprocessor controlled cool-down system is adapted to operate
        a generator fan and the pump wherein operation of the fan and
        the pump continue throughout a cool-down stage following manual
        shut-off of the welder. </p>
      <p>[0036] The produced gas or HHO gas is routed from the dryer
        means to the final gas reservoir tank. Dryer means and are only
        exemplary. It is understood that a single unit may be designed
        to effectively accomplish the same objective. The gas is then
        supplied on-demand to the engine or in this case, the welding
        equipment, through gas line and hydrogen flash suppressor check
        valve (non-return valve) and control valve. </p>
      <p>[0037] As mentioned above, a flame from said produced gas or
        species of hydrogen and oxygen, from said electrolyzer can
        instantly melt solids without the use of atmospheric oxygen. The
        produced gas can also be used as a fuel without the use of
        atmospheric oxygen, and can bond to other substances via
        magnetic induction. </p>
      <p>[0038] A bond is created between a fossil fuel and a
        combustible gas composed by a combination of hydrogen and oxygen
        atoms with toroidal polarization of their orbitals. The bond
        originates from the induced magnetic polarization of at least
        some of the orbitals of said fuel and the consequential
        attraction between opposing magnetic polarities. The combustion
        exhaust of the resulting fuel is cleaner than that of said
        fossil fuels. Further, the resulting fuel has contained more
        thermal energy than that of said fossil fuels. </p>

      <p><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>[0067] A summary of the scientific representation of the
        preceding main features of the HHO gas is outlined below without
        formulae for simplicity of understanding by a broader audience.
      </p>
      <p>[0068] Where the HHO gas originates from distilled water using
        a special electrolytic process described hereinafter, it is
        generally believed that such a gas is composed of 2/3 (or 66.66%
        in volume) hydrogen H2 and 1/2 (or 33.33% in volume) oxygen O2.
      </p>
      <p>[0069] A fundamental point of this invention is the evidence
        that such a conventional mixture of H2 and O2 gases absolutely
        cannot represent the above features of the HHO gas, thus
        establishing the novel existence in the produced inventive HHO
        gas. </p>
      <p>[0070] The above occurrence is established beyond any possible
        doubt by comparing the performance of the HHO gas with that of a
        mixture of 66.66% of H2 and 33.33% of O2. There is simply no
        condition whatsoever under which, the latter gas can instantly
        cut tungsten or melt bricks as done by the HHO gas, therein
        supporting the novelty in the chemical structure of the produced
        HHO gas. </p>
      <p>[0071] To begin the identification of the novelty in the HHO
        gas we note that the special features of the HHO gas, such as
        the capability of instantaneous melting tungsten and bricks,
        require that HHO contains not only "atomic hydrogen" (that is,
        individual H atoms without valence bond to other atoms as in
        FIG. 1a), but also "magnetically polarized atomic hydrogen",
        that is, hydrogen atoms whose electrons are polarized to rotate
        in a toroid, rather than in all space directions, as per FIG.
        1b. </p>
      <p>[0072] It should be indicated that the Brown gas does assumes
        the existence of "atomic hydrogen". However, calculations have
        established that such a feature is grossly insufficient to
        explain all the feature of the HHO gas, as it will be evidence
        in the following. The fundamental novelty of this invention is,
        therefore, the use of "polarized atomic hydrogen" as depicted in
        FIG. 1b. </p>
      <p>[0073] Alternatively, in the event the hydrogen contained in
        the HHO gas is bonded to another atom, the dimension of the H2
        molecules caused by thermal rotations (as partially depicted in
        FIG. 2a) are such to prevent a rapid penetration of hydrogen
        within deeper layers of tungsten or bricks, thus preventing
        their rapid melting. The only know configuration of the hydrogen
        molecule compatible with the above outlined physical and
        chemical evidence is that the molecule itself is polarized with
        its orbitals restricted to rotate in the oo-shaped toroid of
        FIG. 2b. </p>
      <p>[0074] In fact, polarized hydrogen atoms as in FIG. 1b and
        polarized hydrogen molecules as in FIG. 2b are sufficiently thin
        to have a rapid penetration within deeper layers of substances.
        Moreover, the magnetic field created by the rotation of
        electrons within toroids is such so as to polarize the orbitals
        of substances when in close proximity, due to magnetic
        induction. But the polarized orbitals of tungsten and bricks are
        essentially at rest. Therefore, magnetic induction causes a
        natural process of rapid self-propulsion of polarized hydrogen
        atoms and molecules deep within substances. </p>
      <p>[0075] Nature has set the water molecule H2O.dbd.H--O--H in
        such a way that its H atoms do not have the spherical
        distribution of FIG. 1a, and have instead precisely the
        polarized distribution of FIG. 1b along a toroid whose symmetry
        plane is perpendicular to that of the H--O--H plane, as depicted
        in FIG. 3a, as established in the technical literature, e.g., in
        D. Eisenberg and W. Kauzmann, "The Structure and Properties of
        Water." Oxford University Press (1969). </p>
      <p>[0076] It is also known that the H--O--H molecule at ambient
        temperature and pressure, even though with a null total charge,
        has a high "electric polarization" (deformation of electric
        charge distributions) with the predominance of the negative
        charge density localized in the O atom and the complementary
        predominant positive charge density localized in the H atoms.
        This implies a repulsion of the H atoms caused by their
        predominantly positive charges, resulting in the characteristic
        angle of 105 degree between the H--O and O--H dimers as depicted
        in FIG. 3a. </p>
      <p>[0077] Nevertheless, it is well established in quantum
        electrodynamics that toroidal polarizations of the orbitals of
        the hydrogen atom as in the configuration of FIG. 1b create very
        strong magnetic fields with a symmetry axis perpendicular to the
        plane of the toroid, and with a value of said magnetic fields
        that is 1,415 times bigger than the magnetic moment of the
        H-nucleus (the proton), thus having a value such to overcome the
        repulsive force due to charges. </p>
      <p>[0078] It then follows that, in the natural configuration of
        the H--O--H molecule, the strong electric polarization caused by
        the oxygen is such to weaken the magnetic field of the toroidal
        polarization of the H-orbital resulting in the indicated
        repulsion of the two H-atoms in the H--O--H structure. </p>
      <p>[0079] However, as soon as the strong electric polarization of
        H--O--H is removed, the very strong attraction between opposite
        polarities of the magnetic fields of the polarized H atom become
        dominant over the Coulomb repulsion of the charges, resulting in
        the new configuration of FIG. 3b that has been discovered in
        this invention. </p>
      <p>[0080] The central feature of this invention is, therefore,
        that the special electrolyzer of this invention is such to
        permit the transformation of the water molecule from the
        conventional H--O--H configuration of FIG. 3a to the basically
        novel configuration of FIG. 3b, which latter configuration is,
        again, permitted by the fact that, in the absence of electric
        polarization, the attraction between opposite magnetic
        polarities of the toroidal distributions of the orbitals is much
        stronger than the Coulomb repulsion due to charges. </p>
      <p>[0081] By denoting with "--" the valence bond and with
        ".times." the magnetic bond, the water molecule is given by
        H--O--H (FIG. 3a) and its modified version in the HHO gas is
        given by H.times.H--O (FIG. 3b). As a result, according to the
        existing scientific terminology, as available, e.g., in R. M.
        Santilli, "Foundations of Hadronic Chemistry", Kluwer Academic
        Publisher (2001), H--O--H is a "molecule," because all bonds are
        of valence type, while H.times.H--O must be a specific
        "magnecule," because one of its bonds is of magnecular type. </p>
      <p>[0082] The validity of the above rearrangement of the water
        molecule is readily established by the fact that, when the
        species H--O--H is liquid, the new species H.times.H--O can be
        easily proved to be gaseous. This is due to various reasons,
        such as the fact that the hydrogen is much lighter than the
        oxygen in the ratio 1 atomic mass units (amu) to 16 amu. As a
        result, from a thermodynamical view point, the new species
        H.times.H--O is essentially equivalent to ordinary gaseous
        oxygen in full conformity with conventional thermodynamical
        laws, since the transition from liquids to gases implies an
        increase of entropy, as well known. This feature explains the
        creation by our special electrolyzer of a new form of gaseous
        water without any need for evaporation energy. </p>
      <p>[0083] There are also other reason for which the transition
        from the H--O--H configuration of FIG. 3a to the H.times.H--O
        configuration of FIG. 3b implies the necessary transition from
        the liquid to the gaseous state. As it is established in the
        chemical literature (see D. Eisenberg and W Kauzmann quoted
        above), the liquid state of water at ambient temperature and
        pressure is caused by the so-called "hydrogen bridges," namely a
        terminology introduced to represent the experimental evidence of
        the existence of "attractions between hydrogen atoms of
        different water molecules." </p>
      <p>[0084] However, the above interpretation of the liquid state of
        water remain essentially conceptual because it lacks completely
        the identification of the "attractive force" between different H
        atoms, as necessary for the very existence of the liquid state.
        Note that such attraction cannot be of valence type because the
        only available electron in the H atom is completely used for its
        bond in the H--O--H molecule. Therefore, the bridge force cannot
        credibly be of valence type. </p>
      <p>[0085] The precise identification of the attractive force in
        the hydrogen bridges of water at the liquid state has been done
        by R. Santilli in the second above quoted literature, and has
        resulted to be precisely of magnecular type, in the sense of
        being due precisely to attraction between opposite magnetic
        polarities of toroidal distributions of orbitals that are so
        strong to overcome repulsive Coulomb forces. Therefore, the
        H--O--H can be correctly called a "molecule" because all bonds
        are of valence type, while the liquid state of water is composed
        of "magnecules" because some of the bonds are of magnecular
        type. </p>
      <p>[0086] In different terms, a central feature of this invention
        is that the transition from the H--O--H configuration to the new
        H.times.H--O one is essentially caused by the two H atoms
        establishing an "internal hydrogen bridge," rather than the
        usual "external bridge with other H atoms. The first fundamental
        point is the precise identification of the "physical origin of
        the attractive force" as well as its "numerical value," without
        which science is reduced to a mere political nomenclature. </p>
      <p>[0087] In view of the above, it is evident that the transition
        from the H--O--H configuration of FIG. 3a to the H.times.H--O
        configuration of FIG. 3b implies the disruption of all possible
        hydrogen bridges, thus prohibiting the H.times.H--O magnecule to
        be liquid at ambient temperature and pressure. This is due,
        e.g., to the rotation of the H.times.H dimer around the O atom
        under which no stable hydrogen bridge can occur. </p>
      <p>[0088] In conclusion, the transition from the conventional
        H--O--H configuration of FIG. 3a to the new configuration
        H.times.H--O of FIG. 3b implies the necessary transition from
        the liquid to the gaseous state. </p>
      <p>[0089] A first most important experimental verification of this
        invention is that the removal of the electric polarization of
        the water molecule, with consequential transition from the
        H--O--H to the new H.times.H--O configuration, can indeed be
        achieved via the minimal energy available in the electrolyzer
        and absolutely without the large amount of energy needed for
        water evaporation. </p>
      <p>[0090] It is evident that the conventional H--O--H species is
        stable, while the new configuration H.times.H--O is unstable,
        e.g., because of collision due to temperature, thus experiencing
        its initial separation into the oxygen O and H.times.H. The
        latter constitutes a new chemical "species", hereinafter
        referred to detectable "clusters" constituting the HHO gas,
        whose bond, as indicated earlier, originates from the attractive
        force between opposing magnetic polarities in the configuration
        when the toroidal orbitals are superimposed as depicted in FIG.
        4b, rather than being of the conventional molecular type
        depicted in FIG. 4a. </p>
      <p>[0091] The new chemical species H.times.H is another central
        novelty of this invention inasmuch as it contains precisely the
        polarized atomic hydrogen needed to explain physical and
        chemical evidence recalled earlier, the remarkable aspect being
        that these polarizations are set by nature in the water
        molecule, and mainly brought to a useful form by the inventive
        electrolyzer. </p>
      <p>[0092] Note that one individual polarized atomic hydrogen, as
        depicted in FIG. 1b, is highly unstable when isolated because
        the rotations due to temperatures instantaneously cause said
        atom to recover the spherical distribution of FIG. 1a. </p>
      <p>[0093] However, when two or more polarized H atoms are bonded
        together as in FIG. 4b, the bond is fully stable at ambient
        temperature since all rotations now occur for the coupled
        H-atoms. It then follows that the size of the H.times.H species
        under rotation due to temperature is one half the size of an
        ordinary H molecule, since the radius of the preceding species
        is that of one H atom, while the radius of the later species is
        the diameter of one H atom. In turn, this reduction in size is
        crucial, again, to explain the features of the HHO gas. </p>
      <p>[0094] Needless to say, it is possible to prove via quantum
        chemistry that the H.times.H species has a 50% probability of
        converting into the conventional H--H molecule. Therefore, the
        hydrogen content of the HHO gas is predicted to be given by a
        mixture of H.times.H and H--H that, under certain conditions,
        can be 50%-50%. </p>
      <p>[0095] The H--H molecule has a weight of 2 atomic mass units
        (amu). The bond in H.times.H is much weaker than the valence
        bond of H--H. Therefore, the species H.times.H is predicted to
        be heavier than the conventional one H--H (because the binding
        energy is negative). However, such a difference is of the order
        of a small fraction of one amu, thus being beyond the detecting
        abilities of currently available analytic instruments solely
        based on mass detection. It ten follows that the species
        H.times.H and H--H will appear to be identical under
        conventional mass spectrographic measurements since both will
        result to have the mass of 2 amu. </p>
      <p>[0096] The separation and detection of the two species
        H.times.H and H--H require very accurate analytic equipment
        based on magnetic resonances, since the H.times.H species has
        distinct magnetic features that are completely absent for the
        H--H species, thus permitting their separation and
        identification. In this patent application, experimental
        evidence is presented based on conventional mass spectrometry. </p>
      <p>[0097] It should be also noted that the weaker nature of the
        bond H.times.H over the conventional valence bond H--H is
        crucial for the representation of physical and chemical
        evidence. The sole interpretation of the latter is permitted by
        "polarized atomic hydrogen," namely, isolated hydrogen atoms
        without valence bonds with the polarization of FIG. 1b. </p>
      <p>[0098] It is evident that the conventional hydrogen molecule
        H--H does not allow a representation of said physical and
        chemical evidence precisely in view of the strong valence bond
        H--H that has to be broken as a necessary condition for any
        chemical reaction. By comparison, the much weaker magnecular
        bond H.times.H permits the easy release of individual hydrogen
        atoms, precisely as needed to represent experimental data. As a
        matter of fact, this evidence is so strong to select the new
        H.times.H species as the only one explaining physical and
        chemical behavior of the HHO gas, since the conventional H--H
        species absolutely cannot represent such evidence as stressed
        above. </p>
      <p>[0099] The situation for the oxygen atom following its
        separation in the H--O--H molecule is essentially similar to
        that of hydrogen. When the oxygen is a member of the H--O--H
        molecule, the orbitals of its two valence electrons are not
        distributed in all directions in space, but have a polarization
        into toroids parallel to the corresponding polarizations of the
        H atoms. </p>
      <p>[0100] It is then natural to see that, as soon as one H-valence
        bond is broken, and the two H atoms collapse one against the
        other in the H.times.H--O species, the orbitals of the two
        valance electrons of the O atom are correspondingly aligned.
        This implies that, at the time of the separation of the
        H.times.H--O species into H.times.H and O, the oxygen has a
        distinct polarization of its valence orbitals along parallel
        toroids. In addition, the oxygen is paramagnetic, thus quite
        responsive to a toroidal polarization of the valence electrons
        as customary under magnetic induction when exposed to a magnetic
        field. </p>
      <p>[0101] It then follows that the oxygen contained in the HHO gas
        is initially composed of the new magnecular species O.times.O,
        that also has a 50% probability of converting into the
        conventional molecular species O--O, resulting in a mixture of
        O.times.O and O--O according to proportions that can be, under
        certain conditions, 50%-50%. </p>
      <p>[0102] The O--O species has the mass of 32 amu. As in the case
        for H.times.H, the new species O.times.O has a mass bigger than
        32 amu due to the decrease in absolute value of the binding
        energy (that is negative) and the consequential increase of the
        mass. However, the mass increase is of a fraction of one amu,
        thus not being detectable with currently available mass
        spectrometers. </p>
      <p>[0103] It is easy to see that the HHO gas cannot be solely
        composed of the above identified mixture of H.times.H/H--H and
        O.times.O/O--O gases and numerous additional species are
        possible. This is due to the fact that, valence bonds ends when
        all valence electrons are used, in which case no additional atom
        can be added. On the contrary, magnecular bonds such as that of
        the H.times.H structure of FIG. 4b have no limit in the number
        of constituents, other than the limits sets forth by temperature
        and pressure. </p>
      <p>[0104] In the order of increased values of amu, we therefore
        expect in the HHO gas the presence of the following additional
        new species. </p>
      <p>[0105] First, there is the prediction of the presence of a new
        species with 3 amu consisting of H.times.H.times.H as well as
        H--H.times.H. Note that the species H--H--H is impossible since
        the hydrogen has only one valence electron and valance bonds
        only occur in pairs as in H--H, thus prohibiting the triplet
        valence bonds H--H--H. </p>
      <p>[0106] It should be recalled that a species with 3 amu, thus
        composed of three H atoms, has already been identified in mass
        spectrometry. The novelty of this invention is the
        identification of the fact that this species is a magnecule
        H.times.H--H and not the molecule H--H--H, since the latter is
        impossible. </p>
      <p>[0107] Next, there is the prediction of traces of a species
        with 4 amu that is not the helium (since there is no helium in
        water) and it is given instead by the magnecule
        (H--H).times.(H--H) having essentially the same atomic mass of
        the helium. Note that the latter species is expected to exist
        only in small traces (such as parts per million) due to the
        general absence in the HHO gas of polarized hydrogen molecules
        H--H needed for the creation of the species (H--H)--(H--H). </p>
      <p>[0108] Additional species with more than four hydrogen atoms
        are possible, but they are highly unstable under collisions due
        to temperature, and their presence in the HHO gas is expected to
        be in parts per millions. Therefore, no appreciable species is
        expected to exist in the HHO gas between 4 amu and 16 amu (the
        latter representing the oxygen). </p>
      <p>[0109] The next species predicted in the HHO gas has 17 amu and
        consists of the magnecule H.times.O that also has a 50%
        transition probability to the conventional radical H--O.
        Detectable traces of this species are expected because they
        occur in all separations of water. </p>
      <p>[0110] The next species expected in the HHO gas has the mass of
        18 amu and it is given by the new magnecular configuration of
        the water H.times.H--O of FIG. 3b. The distinction between this
        species and the conventional water molecule H--O--H at the vapor
        state can be easily established via infrared and other
        detectors. </p>
      <p>[0111] The next species expected in the HHO gas has the mass of
        19 amu and it is given by traces the magnecule H.times.H--O--H
        or H.times.H--O--H. A more probable species has the mass of 20
        amu with structure H.times.H--O--H.times.H. </p>
      <p>[0112] Note that heavier species are given by magnecular
        combination of the primary species present in the HHO gas,
        namely, H.times.H and O.times.O. We therefore have a large
        probability for the presence of the species H.times.H--O.times.O
        with 34 amu and H.times.H--O.times.O--H with 35 amu. </p>
      <p>[0113] The latter species is depicted in FIG. 5 and consists of
        two conventional dimers H--O of the water molecule under bond
        caused by opposite polarities of the magnetic fields of their
        polarized valence electron orbitals, plus an additional hydrogen
        also bonded via the same magnecular law. </p>
      <p>[0114] Additional heavier species are possible with masses
        re-presentable with the simple equation m.times.1+n.times.16
        amu, where m and n are an integer value of 0 or greater, except
        the case where both m and n are 0, although their presence is
        expected to be of the order of parts per million. </p>
      <p>[0115] In summary, a fundamental novelty of this invention
        relates to the prediction, to be verified with direct
        measurements by independent laboratories outlined below, that
        the HHO gas is constituted by: </p>
      <p>[0116] i) two primary species, one with 2 amu (representing a
        mixture of H.times.H and H--H) in large percentage yet less than
        66% in volume, and a second one with 32 amu (representing a
        mixture of O.times.O and O--O) in large percentage yet less than
        33% in volume; </p>
      <p>[0117] ii) new species in smaller yet macroscopic percentages
        estimated to be in the range of 8%-9% in volume comprising: 1
        amu representing isolated atomic hydrogen; 16 amu representing
        isolated atomic oxygen; 18 amu representing H--O--H and
        H.times.H--O; 33 amu representing a mixture of H.times.O.times.O
        and H.times.O--O; 36 amu representing a mixture of
        H.times.H--O--O.times.H.times.H and similar configurations; and
        37 amu representing a mixture of
        H.times.H--O--O.times.H.times.H.times.H and equivalent
        configurations; plus </p>
      <p>[0118] iii) traces of new species comprising: 3 amu
        representing a mixture of H.times.H.times.H and H.times.H--H; 4
        amu representing a mixture of H--H.times.H--H and equivalent
        configurations; and numerous additional possible species in part
        per million with masses bigger than 17 amu characterized by the
        equation n.times.1+m.times.16, where n and m can have integer
        values 1, 2, 3, and so on. </p>
      <p>[0119] The preceding theoretical considerations can be unified
        in the prediction that the HHO combustible gas is composed of
        hydrogen and oxygen atoms bonded into clusters H.sub.mO.sub.n in
        which m and n have integer values with the exclusion of the case
        in which both m and n are zero. In fact: for m=1, n=0 we have
        atomic hydrogen H; for m=0, n=1, we have atomic oxygen O; for
        m=2 and n=0 we have the ordinary hydrogen molecule
        H.sub.2.dbd.H--H or the magnecule H.times.H; for m=0 and n=2 we
        have the ordinary oxygen molecule O2.dbd.O--O or the magnecule
        O.times.O; for m=1, n=1 we have the radical H--O or the
        magnecule H.times.O; for m=2 n=1 we have water vapor H--O--H or
        the predicted new species of water (FIG. 3b) H.times.H--O; for
        m=3, n=2 we have the magnecules H.times.H--O--H or
        H.times.H.times.H--O; for m=3, n=3 we have the magnecules
        H.times.H.times.H--O.times.O or (H--O--H).times.O; and so on. </p>
      <p>[0120] As we shall see below, "all" the above predicted
        magnecular clusters have been identified experimentally, thus
        confirming the representation of the chemical structure of the
        HHO combustible gas with the symbol H.sub.mO.sub.n where m and n
        assume integer values with the exception of both m and n being
        0. </p>
      <p>[0121] The above definition of the HHO gas establishes its
        dramatic difference with the Brown gas in a final form. </p>
      <p><b>Outline of the Experimental Evidence:</b> </p>
      <p>[0122] On Jun. 30, 2003, scientific measurements on the
        specific weight of the HHO gas were conducted at Adsorption
        Research Laboratory in Dublin, Ohio. The resultant value was
        12.3 grams per mole. The same laboratory repeated the
        measurement on a different sample of the gas and confirmed the
        result. </p>
      <p>[0123] The released value of 12.3 grams per mole is anomalous.
        The general expectation is that the HHO gas consist of a mixture
        of H2 and O2 gases since the gas is produced from water. This
        implies a mixture of H2 and O2 with the specific weight
        (2+2+32)/3=11.3 grams per mole corresponding to a gas that is
        composed in volume of 66.66% H2 and 33.33% O2. </p>
      <p>[0124] Therefore, we have the anomaly of 12.3-11.2=1 gram per
        mole, corresponding to 8.8% anomalous value of the specific
        weight. Therefore, rather than the predicted 66.66% of H2 the
        gas contains only 60.79% of the species with 2 amu, and rather
        than having 33.33% of O2 the gas contains only 30.39 of the
        species with 32 amu. </p>
      <p>[0125] These measurements provide direct experimental
        confirmation that the HHO gas is not composed of a sole mixture
        of H2 and O2, but has additional species. Moreover, the gas was
        produced from distilled water. Therefore, there cannot be an
        excess of O2 over H2 to explain the increased weight. Therefore,
        the above measurement establish the presence in HHO of 5.87% of
        H2 and 2.94% O2 bonded together into species heavier than water
        to be identified via mass spectroscopy. </p>
      <p>[0126] Adsorption Research Laboratory also conducted gas
        chromatographic scans of the HHO gas reproduced in FIG. 6
        confirming most of the predicted constituents of this invention.
        In fact, the scans of FIG. 6 confirm the presence in the HHO gas
        of the following species here presented in order of their
        decreasing percentages: </p>
      <p>[0127] 1) A first major species with 2 amu representing
        hydrogen in the above indicated indistinguishable combination of
        magnecular H.times.H and molecular H--H versions; </p>
      <p>[0128] 2) A second major species with 32 amu representing the
        above indicated combination of the magnecular species O.times.O
        and the molecular one O--O; </p>
      <p>[0129] 3) A large peak at 18 amu that is established by other
        measurements below not to be water, thus leaving as the only
        rational explanation the new form of water H.times.H--O at the
        foundation of this invention; </p>
      <p>[0130] 4) A significant peak with 33 amu that is a direct
        experimental confirmation of the new species in the HHO gas
        given by H.times.H--O.times.H; </p>
      <p>[0131] 5) A smaller yet clearly identified peak at 16 amu
        representing atomic oxygen; </p>
      <p>[0132] 6) Other small yet fully identified peaks at 17 amu,
        confirming the presence of the mixture of the magnecule
        H.times.O and radical H--O; </p>
      <p>[0133] 7) A small yet fully identified peak at 34 amu
        confirming the presence of the new species (H--O).times.(H--O);
      </p>
      <p>[0134] 8) A smaller yet fully identified peak at 35 amu
        confirming the prediction of the new species
        (H--O).times.(H--O).times.H; and </p>
      <p>[0135] 9) numerous additional small peaks expected to be in
        parts per million. </p>
      <p>[0136] It should be added that the operation of the IR detector
        was halted a few seconds following the injection of the HHO gas,
        while the same instrument was operating normally with other
        gases. This occurrence is a direct experimental verification of
        the magnetic features of the HHO gas because the behavior can
        only be explained by the clogging up of the feeding line by the
        HHO gas via its anomalous adhesion to the internal walls of the
        line due to magnetic induction, clogging that progressively
        occurred up to the point of preventing the gas to be injected
        into the instrument due to the small sectional area of the
        feeding line, with consequential halting of the instrument. </p>
      <p>[0137] On Jul. 22, 2003, the laboratory of the PdMA Corporation
        in Tampa, Fla. conducted infrared scans reported in FIGS. 7, 8
        and 9 via the use of a Perkin-Elmer InfraRed (IR) scanner with
        fixed point/single beam, model 1600. The reported scans refer to
        1) a conventional H2 gas (FIG. 7); 2) a conventional O2 gas
        (FIG. 8); and 3) the HHO gas (FIG. 9). </p>
      <p>[0138] The inspection of these scans shows a substantial
        difference between HHO gas and H2 and O2 gases. H2=H--H and
        O2=O--O are symmetric molecules. Therefore, they have very low
        IR peaks, as confirmed by the enclosed scans. The first anomaly
        of HHO is that of showing comparatively much stronger resonating
        peaks. Therefore, the enclosed IR scan of HHO first establish
        that the HHO gas has an asymmetric structure, that is a rather
        remarkable feature since the same feature is absence for the
        presumed mixture if H2 and O2 gases. </p>
      <p>[0139] Moreover, H2 and O2 gases can have at most two
        resonating frequencies each, under infrared spectroscopy, one
        for the vibrations and the other for rotations. Spherical
        distributions of orbitals and other features imply that H2 has
        essentially only one dominant IR signature as confirmed by the
        scan of FIG. 7, while O2 has one vibrational IR frequency and
        three rotational ones, as also confirmed by the scans of FIG. 8.
      </p>
      <p>[0140] The inspection of the IR scans for the HHO gas in FIG. 9
        reveals additional novelties of this invention. First the HHO
        scan reveals the presence of at least nine different IR
        frequencies grouped around wavenumber 3000 plus a separate
        distinct one at around wavenumber 1500. </p>
      <p>[0141] These measurements provide the very important
        experimental confirmation that the species with 18 amu detected
        in the IR scans of FIG. 6 is not given by water, thus leaving as
        the only possibility a direct experimental verification of the
        fundamental novel species H.times.H--O of this invention. </p>
      <p>[0142] In fact, the water vapor with molecules H--O--H has IR
        frequencies with wavelengths 3756, 3657, 1595, their combination
        and their harmonics (here ignored for simplicity). The scan for
        the HHO gas in FIG. 7 confirms the presence of an IR signature
        near 1595, thus confirming the molecular bond H--O in the
        magnecular structure H.times.H--O, but the scan shows no
        presence of the additional very strong signatures of the water
        molecules at 3756 and 3657, thus establishing the fact that the
        peak at 18 amu is not water as conventionally understood in
        chemistry. </p>
      <p>[0143] On Jul. 22, 2003, the laboratory of the PdMA Corporation
        in Tampa, Fla. conducted measurements on the flash point, first
        on commercially available diesel fuel, measuring a flash point
        of 75 degrees C., and then of the same fuel following the
        bubbling in its interior of the FIHO gas, measuring the flash
        point of 79 degrees C. </p>
      <p>[0144] These measurements too are anomalous because it is known
        that the addition of a gas to a liquid fuel reduces its flash
        point generally by half, thus implying the expected flash value
        of about 37 degrees C. for the mixture of diesel and HHO gas.
        Therefore, the anomalous increase of the flash point value is
        not of 4 degrees C., but of about 42 degrees C. </p>
      <p>[0145] Such an increase cannot be explained via the assumption
        that HHO is contained in the diesel in the form of a gas, and
        requires the necessary occurrence of some type of bond between
        the HHO gas and the liquid fuel. The latter cannot possibly be
        of valence type, but it can indeed be of magnetic type due to
        induced polarization of the diesel molecules by the polarized
        HHO gas and consequential adhesion of the constituents of the
        HHO gas to the diesel molecule. </p>
      <p>[0146] A major experimental confirmation of the latter bond was
        provided on Aug. 1, 2003, by the Southwest Research Institute of
        Texas, that conducted mass spectrographic measurements on one
        sample of ordinary diesel marked "A" as used for the above flash
        point value of 75 degrees C., here reported in FIG. 10, and
        another sample of the same diesel with HHO gas bubbled in its
        interior marked "B", here reported in FIG. 11. </p>
      <p>[0147] The measurements were conducted via a Total Ion
        Chromatogram (TIC) via Gas Chromatography Mass Spectrometry
        GC-MS manufactures by Hewlett Packard with GC model 5890 series
        II and MS model 5972. The TIC was obtained via a Simulated
        Distillation by Gas Chromatography (SDGC). </p>
      <p>[0148] The used column was a HP 5MS 30.times.0.25 mm; the
        carrier flow was provided by Helium at 50 degrees C. and 5 psi;
        the initial temperature of the injection was 50 degrees C. with
        a temperature increase of 15 degrees C. per minute and the final
        temperature of 275 degrees C. </p>
      <p>[0149] The chromatogram of FIG. 10 confirmed the typical
        pattern, elusion time and other feature of commercially
        available diesel. However, the chromatograph of the same diesel
        with the HHO gas bubbled in its interior of FIG. 11 shows large
        structural differences with the preceding scan, including a much
        stronger response, a bigger elusion time and, above all, a shift
        of the peaks toward bigger amu values. </p>
      <p>[0150] Therefore, the latter measurements provide additional
        confirmation of the existence of a bond between the diesel and
        the HHO gas, precisely as predicted by the anomalous value of
        the flash point. In turn such a bond between a gas and a liquid
        cannot possibly be of valence type, but can indeed be of
        magnetic type via induced magnetic polarization of the diesel
        molecules and consequential bond with the HHO magnecules. </p>
      <p>[0151] In conclusion, the experimental measurements of the
        flash point and of the scans of FIGS. 10 and 11 establish beyond
        doubt the existence in the HHO gas of a magnetic polarization
        that is the ultimate foundation of this invention. </p>
      <p>[0152] Additional chemical analyses on the chemical composition
        of the HHO gas were done by Air Toxic LTD of Folsom, Calif. via
        the scans reproduced in FIGS. 12, 13 and 14 resulting in the
        confirmation that H2 and O2 are the primary constituents of the
        HHO gas. However, the same measurements imply the identification
        of the following anomalous peaks: </p>
      <p>[0153] a) A peak in the H2 scan at 7.2 minutes elusion times
        (FIG. 12); </p>
      <p>[0154] b) A large peak in the O2 scan at 4 minutes elusion time
        (FIG. 13); and </p>
      <p>[0155] c) A number of impurities contained in the HHO gas (FIG.
        14). </p>
      <p>[0156] FIG. 15 depicts the anomalous blank of the detector
        since it shows residual substances following the removal of the
        gas. The blank following the removal of the HHO gas is anomalous
        because it shows the preservation of the peaks of the preceding
        scans, an occurrence solely explained by the magnetic
        polarization of species and their consequential adhesion to the
        interior of the instrument via magnetic induction. </p>
      <p>[0157] Unfortunately, the equipment used in the scans of FIGS.
        12, 13, 14 cannot be used for the identification of atomic
        masses and, therefore, the above anomalous peaks remain
        unidentified in this test. </p>
      <p>[0158] Nevertheless, it is well know that species with bigger
        mass elude at a later time. Therefore, the very presence of
        species eluding after the H.sub.2 and the O.sub.2 detection is
        an additional direct experimental confirmation of the presence
        in the HHO gas of species heavier than H.sub.2 and O.sub.2, thus
        providing additional experimental confirmation of the very
        foundation of this invention. </p>
      <p>[0159] Final mass spectrographic measurements on the HHO gas
        were done on Sep. 10, 2003, at the SunLabs, located at the
        University of Tampa in Florida via the use of the very recent
        GC-MS Clarus 500 by Perkin Elmer, one of the most sensitive
        instruments capable of detecting hydrogen. </p>
      <p>[0160] Even though the column available at the time of the test
        was not ideally suited for the separation of all species
        constituting HHO, the measurements have fully confirmed the
        predictions i), ii) and iii) above on the structure of the HHO
        gas. </p>
      <p>[0161] In fact, the Scan of FIG. 16 confirm the presence in HHO
        of the basic species with 2 amu representing H--H and H.times.H,
        although their separation was not possible in the Clarus 500
        GC-MS. The same instrument also cannot detect isolated hydrogen
        atoms due to insufficient ionization. The species with 4 amu
        representing H--H.times.H--H could not be detected because
        helium was the carrier gas and the peak at 4 amu had been
        subtracted in the scan of FIG. 16. Note however the presence of
        a clean species with 5 amu that can only be interpreted as
        H--H.times.H--H.times.H. </p>
      <p>[0162] The scan of FIG. 17 provides clear evidence of a species
        with mass 16 amu that confirms the presence in HHO of isolated
        atomic oxygen, thus providing an indirect confirmation of the
        additional presence of isolated hydrogen atoms due to the
        impossibility of their detection in the instrument. The same
        scan of FIG. 17 confirms the presence in HHO of the species H--O
        with 17 amu and the species with 18 amu consisting of H--O--H
        and H.times.H--O, whose separation is not possible in the
        instrument here considered. </p>
      <p>[0163] The scan of FIG. 18 clearly establishes the presence in
        HHO of the species with 33 amu representing O--O.times.H or
        O--O--H, and 34 amu representing O--H.times.O--H and similar
        configurations, while the species with 35 amu detected in
        preceding measurements was confirmed in other scans. </p>
      <p>[0164] The test also confirmed the "blank anomaly" typical of
        all gases with magnecular structure, namely, the fact that the
        blank of the instrument following the removal of the gas
        continues to detect the basic species, which scan is not
        reproduced here for simplicity, thus confirming the anomalous
        adhesion of the latter to the instrument walls that can only be
        explained via magnetic polarization. </p>
      <p>[0165] In conclusion, all essential novel features of this
        invention are confirmed by a plurality of direct experimental
        verifications. In fact: </p>
      <p>[0166] I) The excess in specific weight of 1 gram/mole (or
        8.8%) confirms the presence of species heavier than the
        predicted mixture of H.sub.2 and O.sub.2, thus confirming the
        presence of a species composed of H and O atoms that cannot
        possibly have a valence bond. </p>
      <p>[0167] II) The IR scans done by Adsorption Research (FIG. 6)
        clearly confirm all new species above predicted for the HHO gas,
        thus providing a basic direct experimental verification of this
        invention; </p>
      <p>[0168] III) The halting of the IR instrument in the scans of
        FIG. 6 after one or two seconds following the injection of HHO,
        while the same instrument works normally for conventional gases,
        is a direct experimental confirmation of the presence of
        magnetic polarization in the HHO gas, as routinely detected also
        for all gases having a magnecular structure, and it is due to
        the clogging of the feeding line by the HHO species via magnetic
        induction with consequential adhesion to the walls of the
        feeding line, consequential impossibility for the gas to enter
        in the instrument, and subsequent automatic shut off of the
        instrument itself. </p>
      <p>[0169] IV) The large increase of the flash point of diesel fuel
        following inclusion of the HHO gas also constitutes direct clear
        experimental evidence of the magnetic polarization of the HHO
        gas since it provides the only possible explanation, namely, a
        bond between a gas and a liquid that cannot possibly be of
        valence type, but that can indeed be of magnetic type due to
        magnetic induction. </p>
      <p>[0170] V) The mass spectrometric measurements on the mixture of
        diesel and HHO (FIGS. 10 and 11) provide final experimental
        confirmation of the bond between HHO and diesel. In turn, this
        bond establishes the capability of the species in HHO to
        polarize via magnetic induction other atoms, thus confirming the
        chemical composition of the HHO gas. </p>
      <p>[0171] VI) The additional scans of FIG. 12-18 confirms all the
        preceding results, including the anomalous blank following the
        removal of the HHO gas that confirms the magnetic polarization
        of the HHO gas at the foundation of this invention. </p>
      <p>[0172] VII) The capability by the HHO gas to melt
        instantaneously tungsten and bricks is the strongest visual
        evidence on the existence in the HHO gas of isolated and
        magnetically polarized atoms of hydrogen and oxygen, that is,
        atoms with a much reduced "thickness" that allows their
        increased penetration within the layers of other substances,
        plus the added penetration due to magnetic induction, a feature
        typical of all gases with magnecular structure. </p>
      <p>[0173] It should be noted that the above experimental
        verifications confirm in full the representation of the HHO
        combustible gas with the symbol H.sub.mO.sub.n where m and n
        assume integer values with the exception in which both m and n
        have the value 0. In fact, the various analytic measurements
        reported above confirm the presence of: atomic hydrogen H (m=1,
        n=0); atomic oxygen O (m=0, n=1); hydrogen molecule H--H or
        magnecule H.times.H (m=2, n=0); oxygen molecule O--O or
        magnecule O.times.O (m=0, n=2); radical H--O or magnecule
        H.times.O (m=1, n=1); water vapor H--O--H or magnecule
        H.times.H--O (m=2, n=1); magnecule H.times.H.times.H--O or
        H.times.H--O.times.H (n=3, n=1); magnecule
        H.times.H.times.H--O.times.O or H.times.H--O--O.times.H (m=3,
        n=2); etc. </p>

      <p>[0175] The term "electrolyzer" as used herein refers to an
        apparatus that produces chemical changes by passage of an
        electric current through an electrolyte. The electric current is

        terminal or electrode of an electrolytic cell or electrolyzer.
        Reduction typically occurs at the cathode. </p>
      <p>[0177] The term "anode" as used herein refers to the positive
        terminal or electrode of an electrolytic cell or electrolyzer.
        Oxidation typically occurs at the cathode. </p>
      <p>[0178] The term "electrolyte" as used herein refers to a

      <p>[0179] The term "internal combustion engine" as used herein
        refers to any engine in which a fuel-air mixture is burned
        within the engine itself so that the hot gaseous products of
        combustion act directly on the surfaces of engine's moving
        parts. Such moving parts include, but are not limited to,
        pistons or turbine rotor blades. Internal-combustion engines
        include gasoline engines, diesel engines, gas turbine engines,
        jet engines, and rocket engines. </p>
      <p>[0180] With reference to FIG. 19, an exploded view of an
        electrolyzer is provided. Electrolyzer 2 includes electrolysis
        chamber 4 which holds an electrolyte solution. Electrolysis
        chamber 4 mates with cover 6 at flange 8. Preferably, a seal
        between chamber 4 and cover 6 is made by neoprene gasket 10
        which is placed between flange 8 and cover 6. The electrolyte
        solution may be an aqueous electrolyte solution of water and an
        electrolyte to produce a mixture of the novel gases; however, to
        produce the novel inventive gases, distilled water preferably is
        used. </p>
      <p>[0181] The electrolyte partially fills electrolysis chamber 4
        during operation to level 10 such that gas reservoir region 12
        is formed above the electrolyte solution. Electrolyzer 2
        includes two principle electrodes--anode electrode 14 and
        cathode electrode 16--which are at least partially immersed in
        the electrolyte solution. Anode electrode 14 and cathode
        electrode 16 slip into grooves 18 in rack 20. Rack 20 is placed
        inside chamber 4. One or more supplemental electrodes 24, 26,
        28, 30 are also placed in rack 16 (not all the possible
        supplemental electrodes are illustrated in FIG. 19.) Again,
        supplemental electrodes 24, 26, 28, 30 are at least partially
        immersed in the aqueous electrolyte solution and interposed
        between the anode electrode 14 and cathode electrode 16.
        Furthermore, anode electrode 14, cathode electrode 16, and
        supplemental electrodes 24, 26, 28, 30 are held in a fixed
        spatial relationship by rack 20. Preferably, anode electrode 14,
        cathode electrode 16, and supplemental electrodes 24, 26, 28, 30
        are separated by a distance of about 0.25 inches. The one or
        more supplemental electrodes allow for enhanced and efficient
        generation of this gas mixture. Preferably, there are from 1 to
        50 supplemental electrodes interposed between the two principal
        electrodes. More preferably, there are from 5 to 30 supplemental
        electrodes interposed between the two principal electrodes, and
        most preferably, there are about 15 supplemental electrodes
        interposed between the two principal electrodes. Preferably, the
        two principle electrodes are each individually a metallic wire
        mesh, a metallic plate, or a metallic plate having one or more
        holes. More preferably, the two principle electrodes are each
        individually a metallic plate. A suitable metal from which the
        two principal electrodes are formed, includes but is not limited
        to, nickel, nickel containing alloys, and stainless steel. The
        preferred metal for the two electrodes is nickel. The one or
        more supplemental electrodes are preferably a metallic wire
        mesh, a metallic plate, or a metallic plate having one or more
        holes. More preferably, the one or more supplemental electrodes
        are each individually a metallic plate. A suitable metal from
        which the two principal electrodes are formed, includes but is
        not limited to, nickel, nickel containing alloys, and stainless
        steel. The preferred metal for the two electrodes is nickel. </p>
      <p>[0182] Still referring to FIG. 19, during operation of
        electrolyzer 2 a voltage is applied between anode electrode 14
        and cathode electrode 16 which causes the novel gas to be
        produced and which collects in gas reservoir region 12. The
        gaseous mixture exits gas reservoir region 12 from through exit
        port 31 and ultimately is fed into the fuel system of an
        internal combustion engine. Electrical contact to anode
        electrode 14 is made through contactor 32 and electrical contact
        to cathode electrode 16 is made by contactor 33. Contactors 32
        and 33 are preferably made from metal and are slotted with
        channels 34, 35 such that contactors 32, 33 fit over anode
        electrode 14 and cathode electrode 16. Contactor 32 is attached
        to rod 37 which slips through hole 36 in cover 6. Similarly,
        contactor 33 is attached to rod 38 which slips through hole 40
        in cover 6. Preferable holes 36, 40 are threaded and rods 37, 38
        are threads rods so that rods 37, 38 screw into holes 36, 40.
        Contactors 32 and 33 also hold rack 20 in place since anode
        electrode 14 and cathode electrode 16 are held in place by
        channels 34, 35 and by grooves 18 in rack 20. Accordingly, when
        cover 6 is bolted to chamber 4, rack 20 is held at the bottom of
        chamber 4. Electrolyzer 2 optionally includes pressure relief
        valve 42 and level sensor 44. Pressure relief 42 valve allows
        the gaseous mixture in the gas reservoir to be vented before a
        dangerous pressure buildup can be formed. Level sensor 44
        ensures that an alert is sounded and the flow of gas to the
        vehicle fuel system is stopped when the electrolyte solution
        gets too low. At such time when the electrolyte solution is low,
        addition electrolyte solution is added through water fill port
        46. Electrolyzer 2 may also include pressure gauge 48 so that
        the pressure in reservoir 4 may be monitored. Finally,
        electrolyzer 2 optionally includes one or more fins 50, which
        remove heat from electrolyzer 2. </p>
      <p>[0183] With reference to FIG. 20, a variation of an
        electrolyzer is provided. A first group of the one or more
        supplemental electrodes 52, 54, 56, 58 is connected to anode
        electrode 14 with a first metallic conductor 60 and a second
        group of the one or more supplemental electrodes 62, 64, 66, 68
        is connected to cathode electrode 16 with second metallic
        conductor 70. With reference to FIG. 21, a perspective view
        showing the electrode plate securing mechanism is provided.
        Anode electrode 14, cathode electrode 16, and supplemental
        electrodes 24, 26, 28, 30 are held to rack 20 by holder rod 72
        which slips through channels 74 in rack 20 and holes in the
        electrodes (not all the possible supplemental electrodes are
        illustrated in FIG. 3.) Rack 20 is preferably fabricated from a
        high dielectric plastic such as PVC, polyethylene or
        polypropylene. Furthermore, rack 20 holds anode electrode 14,
        cathode electrode 16, and supplemental electrodes 24, 26, 28, 30
        in a fixed spatial relationship. Preferably, the fixed spatial
        relationship of the two principal electrodes and the one or more
        supplemental electrodes is such that the electrodes (two
        principal and one or more supplemental) are essentially parallel
        and each electrode is separated from an adjacent electrode by a
        distance from about 0.15 to about 0.35 inches. More preferably,
        each electrode is separated from an adjacent electrode by a
        distance from about 0.2 to about 0.3 inches, and most preferably
        about 0.25 inches. The fixed spatial relationship is
        accomplished by a rack that holds the two principal electrodes
        and the one or more supplemental electrodes in the fixed spatial
        relationship. The electrodes sit in grooves in the rack which
        define the separations between each electrode. Furthermore, the
        electrodes are removable from the rack so that the electrodes or
        the rack may be changed if necessary. Finally, since rack 20 and
        anode electrode 14 and cathode electrode 16 are held in place as
        set forth above, the supplemental electrodes are also held in
        place because they are secured to rack 20 by holder rod 72. </p>
      <p>[0184] With reference to FIGS. 22 and 23, a schematic of the
        plumbing and electrical operation of an electrolyzer is depicted
        for an application with an internal combustion engine. During
        operation, the novel combustible gas is formed by the
        electrolysis of the electrolyte solution in electrolyzer 2.
        Electrolyzer 2 is connected to collection tank 80 by pressure
        line 82. The gases are collected and temporarily stored in
        collection tank 80. Collection tank 80 optionally includes
        pressure relief valve 84 to guard against any dangerous pressure
        build up. Collection tank 80 is connected to solenoid 86 by
        pressure line 88. Solenoid 86 is in turn connected by pressure
        line 90 to engine intake manifold 92 of engine 94. Optionally,
        flash arrestor 96 is incorporated in pressure line 90 to prevent
        a flame from propagating in tube 88. Furthermore, pressure line
        90 also includes orifice 97 to regulate the flow of the gaseous
        mixture into intake manifold 92. The size of this orifice will
        depend on the size of the engine. For example, an orifice
        diameter of about 0.04 is suitable for a 1 liter engine, about
        0.06 inches is suitable for a 2.5 liter engine, and about 0.075
        inches is suitable for a V8 engine. The applied voltage to
        electrolyzer 2 is provided through solenoid 98 by electrolyzer
        battery 100. When the pressure in collection tank 80 drops below
        about 25 psi, solenoid 98 switches and a voltage of about 12 V
        is applied between the anode electrode and cathode electrode of
        electrolyzer 2 Battery isolator 102 allows for charging of
        vehicle battery 104 and electrolyzer battery 100 by alternator
        106 while keeping electrolyzer battery 100 and vehicle battery
        104 electrically isolated. Furthermore, solenoid 98 is powered
        by vehicle battery 104 when main switch 108 is activated. Gas
        mixer solenoid 86 is also powered by vehicle battery 104 and
        opens when the gas mixture is provided to intake manifold 92.
        Solenoid 86 also receives feedback from level sensor 44 which
        causes solenoid 86 to shut off gas flow if the electrolyte
        solution level in electrolyzer 2 gets too low. Finally, when the
        method and apparatus of the present invention are used in a
        vehicle, the operation of the vehicle's oxygen sensor needs to
        be adjusted to take into account the additional oxygen that is
        added to the fuel system from the electrolyzer. Normally, if the
        oxygen sensor senses more oxygen, the vehicle's computer would
        determine that the engine is running lean and open up the fuel
        injectors to a richer fuel mixture. This is undesirable and
        would cause poor fuel economy. Electrical lines 110, 112 of
        oxygen sensor 114 preferably include RC circuit 116. RC circuit
        116 includes resistor 118 and capacitor 120. Preferably,
        resistor 118 is about 1 megaohm and capacitor 120 is about 1
        microfarad. Electrical line 110 is the check engine light signal
        and electrical line 112 carries the control signal that is
        related to the amount of oxygen in a vehicle exhaust. Resistor
        118, which is in series in electrical line 110, ensures that the
        vehicle control system interprets the oxygen sensor as operating
        correctly. Similarly, capacitor 120 provides the vehicle's
        computer with a signal such that the vehicles fuel injectors do
        not incorrectly open when the gas from electrolyzer 100 is being
        supplied to the fuel system. Finally, main switch 108 switches
        RC circuit in when gas is being supplied (i.e., the electrolyzer
        is being used) and out when gas is not being supplied. </p>
      <p>[0185] In another embodiment of the present invention, a method
        for increasing the fuel efficiency of an internal combustion
        engine is provided. The method of this embodiment utilizes the
        electrolyzer described above in conjunction with an internal
        combustion engine. Specifically, the method comprises providing
        an electrolyzer equipment described above or as further
        described below in other novel embodiments; applying an
        electrical potential between the electrodes wherein the novel
        combustible gas described herein is generated and collected in
        the gas reservoir region and wherein the electrolyzer is adapted
        to deliver the combustible gas to the fuel system of an internal
        combustion engine; and combining the combustible gas produced
        with fuel in the fuel system of an internal combustion engine.
        The step of adjusting the operation of an oxygen sensor as set
        forth above is also provided. </p>
      <p>[0186] Referring to FIG. 24, which is a flow diagram of another
        embodiment 300 of a gas (hydrogen and oxygen) electrolyzer
        generator system depicted in the figure as being used integrally
        with a welder/cutting torch type of equipment. This system can
        also be used in other types of equipment where heat/combustion
        is desired. This system 300 comprises an electrolyte reservoir
        318, having a top and a bottom, containing electrolytic fluid
        319 therein. The fluid herein is preferably water. The
        electrolyte reservoir 318 comprises a broken or permeable plate
        320 which is sealably and circumferentially positioned around a
        top end of the electrolyte reservoir 318. Plate 320 functions to
        release gas pressure within the electrolyte reservoir 318 when
        exceeding a pre-determined safety level. </p>
      <p>[0187] The self-producing hydrogen and oxygen gas generating
        system 300 further comprises a pump 316, preferably an
        electromagnetic pump, which is connected at one distal end to
        the bottom of the electrolyte reservoir 318. Pump 316 is
        connected at an opposite distal end to at least one hydrogen and
        oxygen electrolyzer/generator 312 containing an electrical
        conductor 352 therein. The electrical conductor 352 is
        electrically connected on one distal end to an electrical
        ground. The opposite distal end of the electrical conductor 352
        is electrically connected to one distal end of a pressure
        controller 328. The opposite distal end of the electrical
        conductor 352 is electrically connected to a power source. Pump
        316 functions to circulate electrolytic fluid 319 from the
        electrolyte reservoir 318 through at least one hydrogen and
        oxygen electrolyzer/generator 312 through a radiator 314 back
        into the electrolyte reservoir 318 via a gas pipe 350. The
        radiator 314 functions to cool the generated hydrogen and oxygen
        gas before returning to the electrolyte reservoir 318. </p>
      <p>[0188] The pressure controller 328 is connected to the
        electrolyte reservoir 318 and monitors the pressure therein.
        When gas pressure within the electrolyte reservoir 318 exceeds a
        pre-determined level, electrical current is terminated to the
        electrical conductor 352 contained within the hydrogen and
        oxygen generator 312 thereby ceasing production of hydrogen and
        oxygen gas. When gas pressure within the electrolyte reservoir
        318 drops below a pre-determined level, electrical current is
        connected to the electrical conductor 352 contained within the
        hydrogen and oxygen generator 312 thereby commencing production
        of hydrogen and oxygen gas. The preselected level is less than
        the preselected level required to cause a pressure release
        through plate 320. </p>
      <p>[0189] This self-producing on-demand hydrogen and oxygen
        generating system 300 further comprises a non-return valve 322
        connected at one end to an upper end of the electrolyte
        reservoir 318 below plate 320. The non-return valve 322 is
        further connected to a dryer/filter means or tank 332 at an
        opposite distal end. </p>
      <p>[0190] System 300 further comprises another filter/dryer means
        or tank 330 in fluid communication with one end of the
        electrolyte reservoir 318 above plate 320 and further connected
        at an opposite distal end to another non-return valve 344 via
        gas line 342, which is connected at an opposite end to another
        filter/dryer means or tank 332. </p>
      <p>[0191] System 300 further comprises a decompression valve 326
        in fluid communication at one end to the top end of the
        electrolyte reservoir 318 and further being in fluid
        communication with the gas pipe 350, which in turn is connected
        to radiator 314. </p>
      <p>[0192] The welding system 300 further comprises a
        microprocessor controlled D.C. amperage regulator 305 adapted to
        regulate the D.C. amperage from the power source to the hydrogen
        and oxygen generator 312. A first microprocessor controlled
        cut-off switch 306 is adapted to terminate the power source to
        the welder in response to a malfunction of the pump 316. </p>
      <p>[0193] A second microprocessor controlled cut-off switch 307 is
        adapted to terminate the power source to the welder in response
        to an insufficient electrolyte solution condition within the
        electrolyte reservoir 318. A microprocessor controlled liquid
        crystal display 308 is adapted to display operating statistics
        regarding the welding system 300, such statistics to include
        hours of operation, amperage, indicator lights and pressure
        gauge readings. The liquid crystal display receives input from a
        plurality of locations within the system 300. </p>
      <p>[0194] A microprocessor controlled polarity change system 309
        is adapted to change the polarity of the electrical conductor
        located within the hydrogen and oxygen generator 312. A
        microprocessor controlled cool-down system 313 is adapted to
        operate a generator fan 311 and the pump 316 wherein operation
        of the fan and the pump continue throughout a cool-down stage
        following manual shut-off of the welder 300. </p>
      <p>[0195] The produced gas or HHO gas is routed from the dryer
        means 332 to the final gas reservoir tank 336. Dryer means 330
        and 332 are only exemplary. It is understood that a single unit
        may be designed to effectively accomplish the same objective.
        The gas is then supplied on-demand to the engine or in this
        case, the welding equipment, through gas line 348 and hydrogen
        flash suppressor check valve (non-return valve) 338 and control
        valve 340. </p>
      <p>[0196] In any of the embodiments of the apparatus/systems
        described above, it is understood that safety devices such as
        hydrogen flash suppressors and/or check valves may, when
        appropriate, be added components to any apparatus/systems. </p>
      <p>[0197] While embodiments of the invention have been illustrated
        and described, it is not intended that these embodiments
        illustrate and describe all possible forms of the invention.
        Rather, the words used in the specification are words of
        description rather than limitation, and it is understood that
        various changes may be made without departing from the spirit
        and scope of the invention. </p>

        <b>Abstract ~</b> The present invention is a device, which
        generates a hydrogen and oxygen gas, preferably used for
        welding. The hydrogen and oxygen gas is generated by an
        electrolyzing process. Electrolyte is pumped into the
        hydrogen-oxygen generator where the gas is separated from the
        electrolyte by applying a direct current voltage across the
        generator. Oxygen is formed in one part, hydrogen in the other
        and then combined to form the gas. As the gas is generated,
        pressure is built up. When the pressure reaches an operating
        pressure, the gas is pumped via the plumbing system into the
        electrolyte reservoir, through a filtering process, and stored
        in a gas reservoir that is connected to a supply line. In

      <p><b>Abstract ---</b> The present invention refers to a method of
        using lean fuel-air mixtures at all operating regimes of a spark
        ignition engine, which is provided with an intake port fuel
        injection system, wherein said method is characterized in that
        in order to achieve the efficient lean mixture combustion
        process, an HHO oxy-hydric gas direct injection should be at a
        minimum pressure of about 10 bars, during the compression
        stroke, after the intake valve closing, so that the
        hydrogen/fuel mixture volumetric fractions value is within the
        range of 15% to 25%. </p>

        <p><b>PROCESS OF BRAZING/SOLDERING BY FLAME OF METALLIC AND
            NON-METALLIC MATERIALS</b> </p>
      </center>
      <p><b>Abstract ---</b> The invention refers to the flame
        soldering/brazing procedure - ECO BRAZ - of metallic and
        nonmetallic materials, used in industrial operations without
        releasing of noxious gases emissions. The soldering/brazing
        procedure according to the invention is achieved totally
        eliminating the noxious gases emissions, reducing the energy
        consumption for the soldering/brazing operation and improving
        the quality of the joints by eliminating the influence of the
        temperature on the joint materials, in the following stages:
        cleaning and scaling of the joining surfaces with
        soldering/brazing flux, adapted as type and method to the
        specification of the materials that make up the joint;
        preparation and positioning of the joining components according
        to the joining drawing and ensuring a correct joint gap in
        relation to the added metal; uniform heating or the joint until
        the soldering/brazing alloy melted with the help of a burner
        with HHO oxy-hydrogen gas at a pressure of 0,1-0,3 MPa; cooling
        of the joint with air and its protection so that it is not moved
        or stricken during the cooling and solidification of the
        soldering/brazing alloy. </p>
