      The Company believes its approach enhances the efficiency of
      thermal energy production because all costs associated with fossil
      fuels are obviated.&nbsp; There is an absence of combustion and
      there are no emissions, or need for chimneys, flues and
      fuel.&nbsp; The high temperature and high pressure systems can be
      adapted to produce hot water or steam in boilers for emissionless
      space heating applications.&nbsp; More advanced applications of
      Brillouin’s technology could power boilers for motive marine power
      and desalinization applications.&nbsp; Refinement and development
      of the technology could ultimately provide methods that
      significantly reduce costs associated with electric power
      generation. <br>
      <br>
      Brillouin’s proprietary electronic pulse generator promotes
      proton-electron capture reactions.&nbsp; The pulses change some of
      the protons in metal to neutrons, and surrounding nuclei
      subsequently captures these produced neutrons.&nbsp; The
      subsequent neutron capture reactions generate heat, and because
      the pulses are controlled the thermal output from Brillouin’s
      proprietary technology safely provides clean heat on demand.<br>

      He’s young, brilliant, and the designer and engineer of a hot
      water boiler based on LENR technology in – Berkeley. His name is
      Robert E. Godes, the Chief Technical Officer at Brillouin Energy,
      a company he founded that’s now hosting visits from venture
      capital groups finally ready to partake in “the greatest
      investment opportunity of the 21rst century”.<br>
      <br>
      In December 2006, Mr. Godes’ first test cell was an open beaker
      using palladium wire and ordinary distilled water, yet this simple
      system achieved an excess heat up to 45%.<br>
      <br>
      The newest device began operating in October of last year and is a
      pressurized nickel-hydrogen system that has allowed superior
      calorimetry measurements. According to the Early Phase 2 Data
      Report, this cell generated excess heat output greater than 100%
      in February of this year. (You can read the Phase 1 and Phase 2
      Data Report on the Brillouin Energy website).<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">Brillouin Controlled Electron
        Capture Reactor (CECR) in the lab.</span><br style="font-style:
        italic;">
      <br>
      With steady progress meeting each company milestone, the lab runs
      with a skeleton staff, including volunteers. Negative perceptions
      about the field of LENR research have discouraged potential
      investors. One possible private donor seeking a technical
      evaluation was informed by a National Science Foundation member
      (whose review entailed “a quick scan” of the Brillouin Energy
      website) that it was “quite possible they had created the ‘instant
      death’ version of cold fusion”.<br>
      <br>
      Sigh.<br>
      <br>
      The very much alive Mr. Godes does believe this is a nuclear
      reaction, but to quote Nobel Laureate Julian Schwinger, whose 1991
      A Progress Report paper you can down-load from the Brillouin
      Energy website, ”The circumstances of cold fusion are not those of
      hot fusion.” <br>
      <br>
      Robert E. Godes uses proprietary electronic "Q-pulses" to
      stimulate the reaction. Q-pulses are a central feature of his
      Quantum Fusion Hypothesis which attempts to explain LENR reactions
      theoretically.<br>
      <br>
      The reaction is not only safe, but clean, and the fuel is
      abundant. According to Mr. Godes:<br>
      <br>
      “Fusing the Hydrogen out of H2O results in 355,000 times more
      energy than is contained in the same volume of gasoline. The
      Hydrogen used in the fusion process is continually replaced by
      solar wind and interstellar space: the ultimate renewable energy
      source.”<br>
      <br>
      Thanks to recent demonstrations of Mr. Rossi’s Energy Catalyzer
      and the plans to commercialize this technology, venture capital
      has finally taken notice of the potential. Brillouin Energy is
      fielding calls from new investors and will now be working with Los
      Alamos National Lab LANL to replicate Brillouin’s work. First, a
      confirmation report from a nationally recognized lab, and then the
      funds.<br>
      <br>
      We recently asked Mr. Godes a few questions about his boiler
      design and what’s next after funding.<br>

      CFN How did you first get interested in this form of energy
      production?<br>
      <br>
      REG I was talking with another engineer at work in 1992. He told
      me about Cold Fusion. When I asked him about the use of palladium
      for the cathode, he told me that they used palladium to filter
      hydrogen. Filter hydrogen? I asked. Helium will not pass though
      it? No!<br>
      <br>
      CFN Which came first, your Hypothesis or the experiments?<br>
      <br>
      REG I knew that the Hydrogen atom was almost twice the size of
      Helium (corrected!) atom. So when I herd that helium would not
      pass but hydrogen would, I formed my hypothesis almost instantly.
      At that point I started studying material science. Once the
      hypothesis was solid, it was used to drive the design of the
      control systems to run the experiments.<br>
      <br>
      CFN You are also using nickel-hydrogen system for your reactor.
      How does your design and process differ from Andrea Rossi’s?<br>
      <br>
      REG The IP [Intellectual Property] I filed in 1995 includes some
      aspects of what Rossi is doing, but there are problems in trying
      to move the technology he is developing into production. He may
      have trouble meeting his deadline for the 1MW reactor as it could
      be difficult transferring the technology to other licensees for
      production.<br>
      <br>
      He had a smiler problem with a potentially great technology doing
      direct thermal to electrical conversion. The manpower needed to
      produce and tweak Rossi units will limit profit margins. He would
      have a much easier time doing small units consisting of single
      devices for consumers, but insurance companies will not allow home
      use due to safety issues. The safety issues with the Rossi device
      will not likely have to do with radiation. Brillouin Energy Corp.
      (BEC) technology will be more reliable making it the market
      winner. Safety issue #1: we use the hydrogen out of ordinary water
      (H2O) in the form of water.<br>
      <br>
      The technology BEC is developing will be easier to manufacture and
      transfer to licensees for market penetration and get approval for
      commercial and consumer use. I have significant experience in
      moving products from engineering to production with involvement in
      some products being produced at more than 100K units / year.<br>
      <br>
      We only started working with the pressurized unit in Q2 2010.
      However we have already identified a large number of the variables
      that need to be controlled and how to control them. When we start
      production I expect it will be a much smoother ramp up than what
      Rossi is facing right now.<br>
      <br>
      CFN What has your experience with the Patent Office been like?<br>
      <br>
      REG Our first patent was initially rejected just on the basis of
      being cold fusion. However after some back and forth they said it
      actually looks like 5 to 7 patents and what would you like to
      prosecute first. So the application is still in process. My guess
      is we will not be granted a patent until we produce lots of data
      at industrially useful levels.<br>
      <br>
      CFN What’s the next step in developing this newest test cell?<br>
      <br>
      REG We have identified several variables that need to be
      controlled and ways to control them. Once we have access to the
      capital, we will be able to automate the process refinement and
      have several units to run the development in parallel. Till then,
      we are still making progress and figuring out how to best leverage
      the equipment we have.<br>
      <br>
      CFN We look forward to your progress. Good luck!<br>
      <br>
      REG Thanks, Ruby. What we really need is clean, dense, always
      available source of energy. <br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Abstract</span> -- A practical
      technique for inducing and controlling the fusion of nuclei within
      a solid lattice. A reactor includes a loading source to provide
      the light nuclei which are to be fused, a lattice which can absorb
      the light nuclei, a source of phonon energy, and a control
      mechanism to start and stop stimulation of phonon energy and/or
      the loading of reactants. The lattice transmits phonon energy
      sufficient to affect electron-nucleus collapse. By controlling the
      stimulation of phonon energy and controlling the loading of light
      nuclei into the lattice, energy released by the fusion reactions
      is allowed to dissipate before it builds to the point that it
      causes destruction of the reaction lattice.<br>

      [0001] This application is a continuation of U.S. patent
      application Ser. No. 11/617,632, filed Dec. 28, 2006 for "Energy
      Generation Apparatus and Method" (Robert E. Godes), which claims
      priority from U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/755,024,
      filed Dec. 29, 2005 for "Energy Generation Apparatus and Method"
      (Robert E. Godes). The entire disclosures of the above-named
      applications (including all attached documents) are hereby
      incorporated by reference for all purposes.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0002] The present invention relates generally to energy
      generation, and more specifically to energy generation using
      nuclear fusion.<br>
      <br>
      [0003] While there is no shortage of people desiring to produce
      energy through controlled fusion, the techniques can be considered
      to fall into two general classes, namely hot fusion and cold
      fusion. Hot fusion has a sound theory, and is known to work in a
      fashion capable of unleashing great amounts of energy in a very
      short amount of time. In some instances, the energy is released in
      an uncontrolled manner, rendering the collection of released
      energy problematical and expensive, possibly prohibitively so. One
      set of techniques for getting the hot fusion reaction to occur at
      a controlled pace uses electrostatic confinement. However,
      extracting more energy than is used to instigate the reaction is
      extremely difficult, if not impossible, due to the Bremsstrahlung
      phenomenon. Another set of techniques uses magnetic confinement,
      although confinement for an extended period of time has problems
      similar to those that beset electrostatic confinement. Another set
      of techniques explores impact fusion, but these attempts suffer
      from problems similar to those bedeviling the other hot fusion
      methods.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] The history of cold fusion is, to say the least, checkered.
      A workable theory of cold fusion does not appear to have been
      articulated, and attempts to produce energy using cold fusion have
      generally not been reproducible and, when excess energy has been
      generated, have been characterized by rapid destruction of the
      device cores in which the reactions are occurring.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] As understood, current state of the art attempts to produce
      "cold fusion" rely upon an effect best described as "gross
      loading." Gross loading is the process whereby the matrix is
      saturated with hydrogen nuclei to the point where, per the theory
      presented in this application, a small amount of phonon energy
      initiates a nuclear reaction. Unfortunately, the first reaction
      creates additional phonons that cause a chain reaction that leads
      to the destruction of the lattice. This approach can create excess
      energy because the high loading density alone leads to a system
      with high Hamiltonian energy in the lattice. This higher energy
      state leads to phonon-moderated nuclear reactions if the loaded
      matrix is stimulated with additional energy inputs, including
      additional loading through electrolysis or other stimuli
      referenced in the Cravens and Letts paper.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] [Cravens2003], and the associated research, demonstrate
      that state of the art researchers have still not recognized the
      connection between increased lattice energy and heat production.
      [George1997] describes using ultrasonically induced multi-bubble
      sonoluminescence to induce fusion events, although because of the
      gross loading the core is quickly destroyed. In this case the
      sonoluminescence is both the source of hydrogen production and
      phonon energy, but there is no mention of any attempt to control
      phonon production or harness phonons to capture the energy
      released. [George1999] describes a device that heats a cylinder to
      400F, but no control mechanism is mentioned or described.
      [George1999] also describes excess &lt;4&gt;He production from
      deuterium during contact with nano-particle palladium on carbon at
      200[deg.] C.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0007] Embodiments of the present invention provide a practical,
      controllable, source of fusion energy based on the mechanisms
      outlined below. This source is scalable from the Micro Electronic
      Mechanical System (MEMS) scale at the milliwatt/watt level to the
      100-kilowatt level and possibility beyond in a single core device.
      In short, embodiments of the invention contemplate inducing and
      controlling phonon-moderated nuclear reactions.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] Another aspect of the present invention provides the
      understanding required to design and build products based on the
      core technology, referred to as Quantum Fusion.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] All the described implementations of this technology
      embodying Quantum Fusion include the following four elements.<br>
      <br>
      a reaction matrix (core);<br>
      a mechanism for inducing phonons in the core;<br>
      a mechanism for introducing (loading) reactants into the core; and<br>
      a mechanism for controlling the loading of reactants and the
      generation of phonons so that reactants, when introduced into said
      core, undergo nuclear reactions to a desired degree without
      destroying the core.<br>
      The control system maintains the rate of phonon generation and
      reactant introduction at a sufficiently high level to cause a
      desired number of nuclear reactions to occur while ensuring that
      the number of nuclear reactions and their depth is limited,
      thereby allowing energy released due to the nuclear reactions to
      dissipate in a manner that substantially avoids destruction of
      said core.<br>
      <br>
      [0014] Associated with embodiments is a heat transfer mechanism,
      which may be inherent in one or more of the above elements, may be
      a separate element, or may have attributes of both.<br>
      <br>
      [0015] In broad terms, embodiments of the invention are believed
      to operate as follows. Reactants (e.g., hydrogen ions from water
      surrounding the core) are introduced into the core (e.g.,
      palladium), and phonons are induced in a controlled manner to
      provide sufficient energy to convert protons into neutrons via an
      electron capture mechanism. The phonon-mediated mechanism is
      sometimes referred to in this application as quantum compression,
      which is a coined term (to be discussed in detail below). The
      neutrons, so generated, are of sufficiently low energy to result
      in high cross sections for neutron-hydrogen reactions.<br>
      <br>
      [0016] This generates increasingly high-atomic-weight isotopes of
      hydrogen, resulting in &lt;4&gt;H, which beta decays to
      &lt;4&gt;He. It is noted that the data in the National Nuclear
      Data Center ("NNDC") database is all derived from experiments
      involving multi-MeV colliders leaving the resulting &lt;4&gt;H
      with enough momentum that it is energetically, the path of least
      resistance to simply eject a neutron. When there is little to no
      momentum involved, neutron ejection is not a viable decay path as
      there is no energy to overcome the binding energy no matter how
      small that energy is. In the NNDC data the neutron is carrying
      reaction energy away from the system in the form of momentum. The
      neutron absorptions and the beta decay are exothermic, and result
      in kinetic energy transfer to the core in the form of phonons,
      which is dissipated by a suitable heat exchange mechanism (e.g.,
      the water that supplied the reactants).<br>
      <br>
      [0017] Another aspect of the present invention is that controlled
      loading of the core material combined with controlled stimulation
      of phonon production prevents excess phonon energy build up, which
      leads to destruction of the core material. This will allow the
      core to operate for extended lengths of time making it an
      economically viable source of energy.<br>
      <br>
      [0018] Another aspect of the present invention is that the core is
      preferably constructed to provide a consistent phonon density at
      the desired reaction points in the core material. This allows
      control over energy liberated with respect to time and the ability
      of the core material to dissipate energy to the heat transfer
      medium. In specific embodiments, the phonon density is controlled
      so that the fusion reaction occurs primarily near the surface of
      the core, thus preventing the type of catastrophic damage to the
      core that has characterized many prior art efforts to produce
      repeatable, sustainable energy generation.<br>
      <br>
      [0019] In some embodiments of the present invention, the reaction
      may be initiated using current as the phonon initiator mechanism.
      In other embodiments of the present invention, acoustic energy
      such as sonic or ultrasonic energy can be used as the phonon
      initiator mechanism.<br>
      <br>
      [0020] In one aspect, apparatus for energy generation comprises: a
      body, referred to as the core, of a material capable of phonon
      propagation; a mechanism for introducing reactants into the core;
      a mechanism for inducing phonons in the core so that reactants,
      when introduced into the core, undergo nuclear reactions; and a
      control system, coupled to the mechanism for introducing reactants
      and to the mechanism for inducing phonons, for controlling the
      number of nuclear reactions and the depth of the nuclear reactions
      in the core so as to provide a desired level of energy generation
      while allowing energy released due to the nuclear reactions to
      dissipate in a manner that substantially avoids destruction of the
      core.<br>
      <br>
      [0021] In another aspect, a method for energy generation
      comprises: providing a body, referred to as the core, of a
      material capable of phonon propagation; introducing reactants into
      the core; generating phonons in the core to provide energy for
      said reactants to undergo nuclear reaction; and controlling the
      rate of reactant introduction and the rate of phonon generation so
      as to control the number of nuclear reactions and the depth of the
      nuclear reactions in the core so as to provide a desired level of
      energy generation while allowing energy released due to the
      nuclear reactions to dissipate in a manner that substantially
      avoids destruction of the core.<br>

      <br>
      [0032] FIG. 1 is a very high level schematic representation of a
      Quantum Fusion reactor 10 encompassing a number of embodiments of
      the present invention. At the heart of the reactor is a reaction
      matrix or core 15 capable of phonon propagation. The general
      operation is for a reactant-loading mechanism 20 to load core 15
      with reactant (e.g., protons) from a reactant source 25, and
      generate phonons in the core material using a phonon-inducing
      mechanism 30. A control system 40 activates and monitors
      reactant-loading mechanism 20 and phonon-inducing mechanism 30.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] The phonon-inducing mechanism may stimulate phonons in the
      core directly using one or more means such as sonic/ultrasonic
      waves, current, or heat. Phonon energy causes displacement of the
      core lattice nuclei from their neutral positions. In the case
      where this displacement moves lattice nuclei closer together the
      density increases and is further increased by the presence of
      hydrogen nuclei (&lt;1&gt;H (protium), &lt;2&gt;H (deuterium), or
      &lt;3&gt;H (tritium)). As the density increases, the Fermi energy
      of the electrons increases, and so it becomes energetically
      favorable for an electron and proton to combine to make a neutron
      and a neutrino. The neutrino escapes from the reactor; however the
      electron capture results in an overall reduction of system energy
      by ~782 KeV.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] The resulting low-energy neutron has a high cross section
      of reaction with other H, D, or T nuclei. The formation of a
      deuteron from protium releases ~2.24 MeV, the transition of D to T
      releases ~6.26 Mev and the transition to &lt;4&gt;H with the
      subsequent [beta]&lt;-&gt; decay releases ~22.36 MeV. Due to the
      wave nature of phonons and the associated density function driving
      the electron capture the overall momentum of the resulting
      &lt;4&gt;H is low enough that [beta]&lt;-&gt; is the decay
      function. Associated with the reactor is a heat transfer mechanism
      45, which may be inherent in one or more of the above elements,
      may be a separate element, or may have attributes of both.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] Control system 40 is shown having bi-directional
      communication with reactant-loading mechanism 20 via a control
      channel 50 and with phonon-inducing mechanism 30 via a control
      channel 55, and additional communication paths are shown. While
      the communication between the control mechanism and the
      reactant-loading and phonon-inducing mechanisms will usually be
      associated with electrical connections, the communication paths
      are intended to be very general. For example, as noted above, the
      phonon-generation mechanism may use ultrasonic energy or heat.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] Control system 40 is also shown as having bi-directional
      communication with core 15 and heat transfer mechanism 45 via
      control channels 60 and 65. These additional control channels
      would allow an additional ability to control the reaction, but or
      both may be unnecessary in some embodiments. In some embodiments,
      these control channels provide signals from pressure and
      temperature sensors.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] Control system 40 is shown as an enlarged detail with
      specific connections. More specifically, from the point of view of
      control system 40, control channel 50 is shown as having control
      outputs 50a and 50b, and a control input 50c. Similarly, control
      channel 55 is shown as having control outputs 55a, 55b, and 55c,
      and a control input 55d; control channel 60 is shown as having a
      control outputs 60a and 60b, and control outputs 60c and 60d; and
      control channel 65 is shown as having control inputs 65a and 65b,
      and control outputs 65c and 65d.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] The same reference numbers will be used in the different
      embodiments, with the understanding that what are seen as control
      inputs and outputs from the point of view of control system 40
      will be seen as control outputs and inputs from the point of view
      of reactant-loading mechanism 20, phonon-inducing mechanism 30,
      heat transfer mechanism, and core 15. Different embodiments may
      have different combinations of control inputs and outputs.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] Four specific embodiments of a Quantum Fusion reactor are
      described in detail below. A first embodiment (FIG. 2 and FIGS.
      3A-3C) uses an electrical field to control loading of the core
      material and current pulses as part of the phonon-generation
      mechanism. A second embodiment (FIG. 4) uses an electrical field
      to control loading of the core material and sonic or ultrasonic
      energy as part of the phonon-generation mechanism. A third
      embodiment (FIG. 5) uses a fluidized bed of core material.
      Reactant is pumped directly into the reaction chamber to control
      core loading. The fluidized bed is capable of phonon propagation.
      Phonon generation in the fluidized bed may be stimulated by
      directly imparting sonic/ultrasonic energy, current, or a
      combination of both. A fourth embodiment (FIG. 6) is a sealed
      container device in which the combination of reactant gas pressure
      and the temperature of the core material control the loading rate.
      The elements have been numbered such that elements having
      equivalent or analogous function from embodiment to embodiment
      have the same identifying reference number.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Common Features of the Preferred
        Quantum Fusion Embodiments</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0040] The following table sets forth the basic elements of the
      embodiments, the first four of which were briefly outlined above.<br>
      <br>
      [0000]<br>
      <br>
      15&nbsp; Core 15 comprises a lattice type material (magnesium,
      chromium, iron, cobalt, nickel, molybdenum, palladium, silver,
      tungsten some ceramics, etc.) capable of propagating phonons,
      loading reactants, and supplying valence or conduction band
      electrons. FIGS. 5 and 6 show a fluidic or powder bed
      implementation of the core where the reactants are readily
      absorbed by the liquid or powder core material. FIG. 6 shows a
      version where the reactants and core material are isolated from
      the heat transfer medium.<br>
      <br>
      30&nbsp; Phonon-inducing mechanism 30 has as its primary function
      transferring energy&nbsp; to the core in the form of phonons. A
      second function, for cases where the loading is induced by means
      of an electric field, is allowing the entire core to be given a
      negative charge with respect to the anode. This provides for
      uniform loading of the core. In FIG. 6 the Quantum compression may
      be induced in three separate ways;<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;1) sonic/ultrasonic induction, using the impedance match and
      energy feed through horn,<br>
      <br>
      2) Quantum current, induced using the feed-through horn as one
      electrode and the dashed line as the other, <br>
      <br>
      3) Thermal, using the heating element connected using the dash dot
      lines.<br>
      <br>
      25&nbsp; The source of the reactant.<br>
      <br>
      45&nbsp; Heat transfer medium 45 will in some instances include
      water. In systems where hydrogen is the reactant material it is
      possible to use the flux of alpha particles as an electromotive
      force and as a medium for system heat removal.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp; See U.S. Pat. No. 6,753,469.<br>
      <br>
      40&nbsp; Control system 40 communicates with reactant-loading
      mechanism 20 via channel 50, with phonon-inducing mechanism 30 via
      channel 55, with sensors via channel 60, and with the core via
      channel 65.<br>
      <br>
      70&nbsp; Anode of systems using an electric field for loading of
      reactants in the form of positive ions. More generically a
      reactant feed.<br>
      <br>
      75&nbsp; Cathode or minus side of the loading current source or
      other ion delivery system. Should be coupled to the core to allow
      uniform loading of positive ions into the core. More genetically,
      a reactant return.<br>
      <br>
      50a&nbsp; Control output 50a provides on/off control for the
      loading source in electrically loaded systems. In non-electrically
      loaded systems, this can control the flow of reactants FIG. 4 or
      extract reactants FIG. 5.<br>
      <br>
      50b&nbsp; Control output 50b is used to set the level for loading
      source. In electrically loaded systems, this would set the current
      level. In other systems, it could control circulation of reactants
      or speed of reactant injection.<br>
      <br>
      50c&nbsp; Control input 50c is used to monitor the reactant
      loading system. With electrically loaded systems it can provide
      information on the level and state of the reactant/heat transfer
      medium. On non-electrically loaded systems it can provide
      pressure, density, or other operating parameters.<br>
      <br>
      20&nbsp; Reactant-loading mechanism 20. In devices using
      electrolytic loading (FIGS. 2, 3A-3C, and 4), this is the current
      source for loading positive ions into the core. In FIG. 5 it is a
      pump and or a flow control valve. In this figure the fuel source
      may simply be turned off to stop the reaction. In FIG. 6 mechanism
      20 is used to pressurize the reaction chamber. By loading the
      reactant in through the bottom inlet buried in the core material
      it facilitates loading of the reactants. The circulation return
      line may be used to evacuate the fuel from the reaction chamber
      for rapid shut down. The circulation return line also allows
      mechanism 20 to circulate the reactants through the fluidic or
      powdered core aiding in uniform reaction rates.<br>
      <br>
      55d&nbsp; Control input 55d is used for monitoring the quantum
      compression and is used for determination of the fusion efficiency
      as well as the status of the core. Depending on the core material,
      temperature and input energy level, the values returned through
      this sensor(s) will aid in determining the state of the core.<br>
      <br>
      55a&nbsp; Control output 55a is used as a control input to set the
      power level of the quantum compression delivered to the core.<br>
      <br>
      55b and&nbsp; Control outputs 55b and 55c are only applicable to
      devices using quantum<br>
      <br>
      55c&nbsp; current as the phonon generation source, and determine
      the direction of the quantum current pulse. Alternating the
      direction of current maintains uniform loading of the core
      material.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] FIG. 2 shows schematically an embodiment with electrolytic
      loading and current pulses for phonon generation. A pulsed loading
      current increases reactant density at the surface of the core.
      Short, quantum current pulses can be used to initiate phonon
      generation. These quantum current pulses also increase electron
      density at the core surface, due to and exploiting the skin
      effect, raising the rate of neutron generation via electron
      capture at the surface and preventing gross loading which leads to
      core destruction. In this embodiment, a suitable isolation
      technology is used to connect both ends of the core material to
      the phonon generator. The isolation of the quantum current from
      the loading current allows better control over reactants in the
      first fusing stage that creates neutrons.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] Control system 40 varies and monitors the power associated
      with both loading current and quantum current. For any given
      reactor using a quantum current to activate the core, changes in
      the power level (voltage*current) at any given temperature/current
      operating point is indicative of changes of the core being
      monitored. The loading system power (voltage*current) for any
      given loading current level can also be monitored to provide
      information on the system status. For reliability purposes the
      control system designer (during initial development) and the
      system operator (during routine operation) should run the system
      to be controlled while varying one parameter at a time to
      characterize the system. This will build a multi-dimensional
      control space where different points within the space will
      indicate problems such as core degradation, low water level,
      liquid pH problems and or scaling of the core.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] Reactant-loading mechanism 20 in FIG. 2 can be a pulse
      transformer or other current source of sufficient compliance to
      create the loading current required to drive electron capture
      events. The loading current value is dependent on temperature,
      core cross-section, loading surface area, and compression current.
      An example of a functional reactor parameter set is quantum
      current pulse values of 4 A for 40 ns at a 100 KHz rep rate, with
      a loading current on the order of 100 mA at a water temperature of
      65C with a 0.05 mm wire core with on the order of 5 cm immersed in
      the water.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] FIGS. 3A and 3B are circuit schematics showing possible
      implementations of reactant-loading and phonon-generation
      circuitry.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] FIG. 3C shows a particular implementation. Core 15 is
      connected to a connection point J1, which connects the reactor
      core to the secondary of a transformer T8, which is used to
      isolate the core from the phonon-inducing mechanism. The center
      tap on the secondary of transformer T8 is attached to the cathode
      75 of the loading current source (F04 is the connection point of
      the cathode), providing uniform loading of the core material. The
      device can be made to work with a non-center-tapped connection but
      this can lead to non-uniform loading leading to uneven heating of
      the core which could actually be used to benefit in a high axial
      flow rate parallel to the core system.<br>
      <br>
      [0046] Capacitor C5, FETs U5 and U5A, and FETs U6 and U6A provide
      for symmetrical quantum current pulses in the clockwise and
      counterclockwise directions, which aid in uniform loading and
      reaction rates in the core. Outputs from half-bridge driver U4
      drive the gates of the FETs. Capacitor C2 is a high voltage, high
      capacitance low impedance device several orders of magnitude
      larger than capacitor C5. The voltage on capacitor C2 is provided
      on control channel 55. FETs U5 and U5A charge capacitor C5. FETs
      U6 and U6A discharge the charge stored in capacitor C5, providing
      an opposite polarity quantum current pulse. The FETs are
      controlled to control the direction of the quantum current pulse,
      shown as receiving signals over control channels 55b and 55c in
      FIG. 2. The source-switched configuration provides rapid switching
      to provide the edge speeds required for driving the quantum
      current pulses.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] This type of driving arrangement gives very fast rise time
      and short duration quantum current pulses, enhancing the skin
      effect and concentrates reactions at the surface of the core. This
      helps to prevent damage from deep and excessive loading of the
      core material. By adjusting the voltage on capacitor C2 (control
      channel 55a) it is possible to directly control the power of the
      quantum current pulses. The required current level of the quantum
      current pulses varies depending on the temperature, core
      cross-section, core surface area, loading rate, and power
      generation needs of the system. The power level can also be used
      to detect a change in status of the core, indicating core
      integrity issues.<br>
      <br>
      [0048] A a shunt resistor R2 is used for measuring the loading
      current entering the core. The loading power entering the system
      can be calculated by multiplying the value of current measured on
      shunt resistor R2 by the voltage across the loading current
      source. The loading current power measurement allows feedback of
      such system conditions as water Ph, pressure, and water level. The
      water can function as the heat transfer mechanism. The anode of
      the current loading source is preferably made of a material that
      will not be attacked by oxygen at the desired operating
      temperatures. The voltage across shunt resistor R2 provides a
      measure of the quantum current while the voltage across connection
      points P11 and P12 provides a measure of the voltage. The product
      provides a measure of the power of the quantum current compression
      pulses.<br>
      <br>
      [0049] Control of the reactant-loading and quantum compression
      levels can be similar, for example comprising a capacitor with an
      electronic switch (FET Q4 in FIG. 3B) controlled by the on/off
      mechanism.<br>
      <br>
      [0050] FIG. 4 is a schematic of an embodiment in which
      phonon-inducing mechanism 30 is implemented by an ultrasonic
      transmitter to generate the quantum compression phonons. The core
      of this embodiment may have the same characteristics as the core
      in the embodiment shown in FIG. 2, and electrolysis is again
      responsible for loading. A current source is the preferred loading
      control method. For the reactant source, a liquid is recommended
      to simultaneously accomplish the heat transfer function. Core 15
      is connected to the ultrasonic transmitter using an impedance
      match device 80 and feed-through to the inside of the reaction
      vessel. In analogy to the above embodiment shown in FIG. 2,
      control channel 55a controls the quantum compression power, which
      is converted to ultrasonic energy by the ultrasonic transmitter.
      Reactant loading is controlled with a current source, which may be
      the same loading embodiment shown in FIG. 2.<br>
      <br>
      [0051] Control system 40 collects information from the loading
      source feedback via control channel 50c and phonon generator
      feedback via control channel 55d, as well as other system inputs,
      to determine the correct inputs to reactant-loading mechanism 20
      and determine the correct quantum compression power to be supplied
      to phonon-inducing system 30. The former is effected via signals
      on control channels 50a and 50b; the latter via signals on control
      channel 55a. These are controlled in order to achieve the desired
      rate of fusion. Due to the lack of quantum current it may be
      necessary to at least initiate this type of device with deuterium.
      The advantage if using deuterium is that there is no net neutron
      production required and thus no net absorption of electrons.<br>
      <br>
      [0052] FIG. 5 is an embodiment wherein core 15 is in the form of a
      fluidic bed (i.e., a bed of small particles). A possible suitable
      material would be palladium-plated carbon black, which is
      commercially available for use as a catalyst, e.g., from
      Sigma-Aldrich Co., 3050 Spruce Street, St. Louis, Mo. 63103 or
      Shanghai July Chemical Co., Ltd., 2999 Zhangyang Road, Pudong,
      Shanghai City. China 200135. Alternatively, the core could be a
      porous ceramic. Phonon-inducing mechanism 30 is implemented by an
      ultrasonic transmitter, which transmits ultrasonic energy into the
      reaction vessel using an impedance match device and feed-through
      so as to transfer the energy into the core and set up the phonons
      required to provide the inter-atomic energy needed to achieve the
      electron capture phenomenon. The ultrasonic energy is controlled
      via control channel 55d.<br>
      <br>
      [0053] The loading of reactant 25 is dependent on the phase of the
      reactant. If it is a high-pressure gas, reactant-loading mechanism
      20 may be a simple metering device for charging the vessel, and
      the source of signals over control channel 50c may be a pressure
      gage. In the pressurized vessel embodiment, the reactant feed (70)
      works with reactant return line (75) to circulate the reactant
      through the core to stir the helium out of the core and keep fresh
      reactant in contact with the core material. This embodiment will
      likely require the use of deuterium fuel as there is no readily
      available source of electrons for the creation of neutrons. When
      using deuterium, there is no net consumption of electrons. Rather,
      the electrons only act as a catalyst.<br>
      <br>
      [0054] As in the embodiments shown in FIGS. 2 and 4, control
      system 40 collects information from the loading source feedback
      via control channel 50c and phonon generator feedback via control
      channel 55d, as well as other system inputs, to determine the
      correct inputs to reactant-loading mechanism 20 and determine the
      correct quantum compression power to be supplied to
      phonon-inducing system 30.<br>
      <br>
      [0055] FIG. 6 shows an embodiment similar to that shown in FIG. 5,
      except that the phonon production can be delivered in the form of
      ultrasonic energy, quantum current, or sufficient thermal energy,
      shown as an electric heater 85. Ultrasonic and quantum current
      have the advantage of faster response time and better phonon
      distribution. As in the embodiment of FIG. 5, the reactant is
      directly injected into the core material, which may be in the form
      of a fluidic bed. If no quantum current is provided it may not be
      possible to implement this type of device without deuterium fuel.<br>

      <br>
      [0057] Unlike the common assumptions involved in "Cold Fusion," it
      is believed that the energy released in these reactions is the
      result of neutron capture by hydrogen isotopes and the beta decay
      of &lt;4&gt;H to &lt;4&gt;He. The energy released by neutron
      capture and beta decay is given by the following equations
      relating the masses of reacting components to products:<br>
      <br>
      [0000]<br>
      <br>
      (neutron + &lt;1&gt;H - &lt;2&gt;H) * c&lt;2 &gt;=&nbsp; 02.237

      An additional alternative reaction path is a &lt;2&gt;H undergoing

      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">[0058] The Source of the Free
        Neutrons</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0059] The neutrons participating in these reactions are the
      product of flavor change of protons that have been loaded into the
      core lattice (while the current implementation contemplates a
      crystalline core, other implementations may use ceramic cores or
      powder beds). The flavor change represents the transmutation of
      the proton into a neutron by a process similar to electron
      capture. Neutron generation requires a crystal lattice capable of
      generating phonons, capable of loading hydrogen ions, and which
      can supply valence or conduction band electrons, providing the
      ~511 KeV electron mass. The required system is one that can
      achieve a total Hamiltonian energy of ~782 KeV. This value
      represents the difference in mass between the proton-electron
      combination and the mass of the neutron. This combination leads to
      the transformation of a proton and electron into a neutron. This
      is an endothermic reaction that leads to an overall lower system
      energy level. The system is converting only enough energy (mass)
      to affect an electron capture, leaving the resulting neutron at an
      extremely low energy level. The resulting low energy neutron has a
      high cross section of reaction with respect to &lt;(1-3)&gt;H
      nuclei in the lattice. This neutron capture is similar to the
      process leading to a neutron star as discussed in [Baym1971], and
      applies to the H, D and T caught in the lattice and further
      enhanced by the quantum currents which allows the lower loading in
      this system.<br>
      <br>
      [0060] It is believed that that energy is transferred to the
      protons through superposition of multiple phonon wave functions
      within the lattice of the core. This energy grows very rapidly as
      the non-bonded energy is extremely asymmetric. As mentioned in
      [NIH_Guide], "Repulsion is modeled by an equation that is designed
      to rapidly blow up at close distances (1/r&lt;12 &gt;dependency)."
      Additional energy beyond the phonon energy is realized from atomic
      band state confinement of ions. When local loading of the lattice
      is high, hydrogen ions take up positions at the octahedral points
      of vacant S(n+1) electron orbitals between the PnS(n+1) orbital
      wave function energy levels in transition metals. This wave
      function energy level occupation provides confinement necessary
      for what is referred to as Quantum Compression, a property arising
      out of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.<br>
      <br>
      [0061] Because both the electron and proton are fermions, the ions
      so trapped experience confinement effects. This confinement energy
      effect is a function of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle as
      stated in the form [Delta][rho]&gt;=(h/2[pi])/[Delta]x and can be
      enhanced through increased electron density causing occupation of
      adjacent bands. The conversion of a proton to a neutron is a
      natural energy reduction mechanism (it requires the addition of
      ~1.253*10&lt;-13 &gt;J), converting energy to the mass difference
      between the proton-electron combination and the mass of a neutron
      while simultaneously eliminating a positive charge between the
      compressing nuclei. Because the transmutation is endothermic in
      nature, the system achieves higher entropy through the
      transmutation. The transmutation results in low-energy neutrons
      that have a high cross-section with respect to other hydrogen
      nuclei, giving an elevated reaction probability.<br>
      <br>
      [0062] Energy released in the neutron absorptions interacts with
      lattice phonons in such a way that it is translated into kinetic
      energy in the lattice where it is dissipated into the surrounding
      environment (heat exchange mechanism).<br>

      <br>
      [0063] It is the understanding of the reaction at the quantum
      level that reveals how to obtain the control and reliability
      required for commercial applications. Below is an outline of the
      steps involved in the reaction. By understanding the underlying
      mechanism that initiates a Quantum Fusion reaction it will be
      possible to use the knowledge contained in this patent to meet
      most of the world's energy needs today and for the foreseeable
      future. Phonon-Moderated Nuclear Reactions proceed most
      efficiently in the following way:<br>
      <br>
      [0064] A loading pulse causes dissociation of reactant into ions
      by electrolysis, and the electrolysis drives free reactants into
      the core substance. The loading pulse also increases the ion
      density at the surface of the core. [Davis2001] notes that "An
      investigation of catalytic dissociation of gas molecules has found
      that dissociation can follow several paths, e.g., direct reactions
      and the formation of transient states, as discussed in the article
      by J. Jellinek entitled "Theoretical Dynamical Studies of Metal
      Clusters and Cluster-Ligand Systems," (Metal-Ligand Interactions:
      Structure and Reactivity, N. Russo (ed.), Kluwer Dordrecht,
      1995.). Electric fields, which are extremely strong at the surface
      of the reaction material, serve to attract these dissociated
      molecules to the material's surface. Advantageously, some of the
      hydrogen piles up at the material's surface, and then enters the
      material due to kinetic energy directed along electric field
      lines."<br>
      <br>
      [0065] The core is a material, (magnesium, chromium, iron, cobalt,
      nickel, molybdenum, palladium, silver, tungsten some ceramics,
      etc.) capable of propagating phonons, loading reactants, and
      supplying valence or conduction band electrons. The following are
      descriptions of possible methods for achieving quantum
      compression. The quantum compression method allows the Quantum
      Fusion reaction to be initiated near the surface of the core,
      avoiding the core destruction inherent with deep loading.<br>
      <br>
      [0066] The electrons provide ~511 KeV of mass. The required core
      system is able to achieve a total Hamiltonian energy of ~782 KeV
      at reactant trapping points. This phonon energy, in combination
      with the electron and its associated momentum, supply the total
      mass required to convert a proton to a neutron. The resulting
      neutron is at an extremely low energy level. The low energy level
      provides an extremely high cross section allowing neutrons to
      accumulate and eventually leading to beta decay resulting in the
      formation of &lt;4&gt;He.<br>
      <br>
      [0067] The present invention can provide the additional energy
      required for the transmutation in one of two ways. The first way
      is by synchronizing an electrical current through the cathode
      (quantum current) with the electrolysis (loading) pulse. The high
      current, high frequency-content pulse through the matrix induces
      the creation of required phonon energy. Second, this energy may
      also be supplied by inducing phonons using a sonic or ultrasonic
      transmitter suitably coupled to the core material. Without a
      source of electrons for neutron capture it is necessary to use
      deuterium as fuel. The reason deuterium does not require reaction
      electrons is that after a capture event by a deuteron and
      subsequent merger with another deuteron, an electron (beta
      particle) is emitted resulting in no net electron absorption.<br>
      <br>
      [0068] It is the inter-atomic energy caused by "phonons" that is
      the closest description of what is happening known to Applicant at
      this time. The quantum pulses are far in excess of what the wire
      is able to handle for any length of time. Standard "phonons" in
      palladium are ~50 meV but that is not going to displace the atoms
      and cause electro-migration of the atoms. The quantum pulses do
      appear to cause electro-migration in order to achieve the required
      compression energy providing 782 KeV. I have now run single pulses
      as high as 35 A down the 0.05 mm wire and that does not appear to
      be a typical phonon (50 meV phonons are unlikely to add up to
      provide 768 KeV. With a fast enough edge and short enough width,
      much lower amplitudes are enough to provide the 782 KeV necessary
      to the 6-atom unit cell where the electron capture takes place.<br>
      <br>
      [0069] Protons loaded into the crystal lattice occupy positions in
      the conduction band of lattice atoms and obey Bloch's Theorem. A
      Bloch wave or Bloch state is the wave function of a particle
      placed in a periodic potential (a lattice). It consists of the
      product of a plane wave and a periodic function unk(r) which has
      the same periodicity as the potential:<br>
      <br>
      [0000]<br>
      [psi]nk(r)=e&lt;ik.r&gt;unk(r)<br>
      <br>
      [0000] The plane wave vector k multiplied by Planck's constant is
      the particle's crystal momentum. It can be shown that the wave
      function of a particle in a periodic potential must have this form
      by proving that translation operators (by lattice vectors) commute
      with the Hamiltonian. This result is called Bloch's Theorem. The H
      nuclei in these locations come under extremely high field pressure
      from the surrounding lattice nuclei. When phonon displacement
      energy reaches a magnitude of 782 KeV in the vicinity of an H
      nucleus it becomes energetically favorable for an electron capture
      event. The resulting neutron is in a very low energy state with a
      correspondingly high cross section of interaction with existing H
      nuclei.<br>
      <br>
      [0070] According to quantum field theory, the potential energy of
      the Hamiltonian can be expressed in terms of fermion and boson
      creation and annihilation operators such that a set of processes
      is defined in which a fermion in a given eigenstate either absorbs
      or emits a boson (phonon), thereby being pushed into a different
      eigenstate. The change in eigenstate is the change of an Up quark
      to a down quark, which changes a proton to a neutron.<br>
      <br>
      [0071] The hypothesis of the core operation asserts that it is
      through the creation and absorption of phonons (bosons) that the
      energy induced as vibrations in the atomic lattice is translated
      to the nuclear scale, and by which the nuclear energy released by
      neutron absorption and transmutation is being dispersed as kinetic
      energy in the lattice. The phonons provide the scale coupling
      between electromagnetic force-level stimuli in the atomic lattice
      and the subatomic level increases in momentum.<br>
      <br>
      [0072] In systems using hydrogen as the reactant, proton
      occupation of limited positions within the lattice and augmented
      by octahedral points between the PnS(n+1)Dn orbital wave function
      energy levels in the core transition metal provides additional
      confinement points. There has been a fair amount of discussion
      within the cold fusion community of the octahedral points within
      the lattice being pinning points for the hydrogen ions. One of the
      key points missing in these discussions is a consideration of the
      octahedral points between the PnS(n+1)Dn orbital structures in the
      transition metals that seem to work. It is in these available
      orbital wave function energy levels that the hydrogen ion wave
      functions may be sufficiently confined to undergo the
      transmutation.<br>
      <br>
      [0073] The quantum current pulse initiates the phonons and
      provides the reacting electrons that lead to neutron production
      before excessive absorbed hydrogen has had the opportunity to
      migrate very deeply into the lattice. Deep loading to a high
      density can lead to the gross loading condition of current cold
      fusion technology. In this condition the first reaction initiates
      a chain reaction of all nearby trapped H nuclei. Such a chain
      reaction liberates so much energy that lattice bonds break,
      causing disintegration of the core.<br>
      <br>
      [0074] The proton drift current induced by the quantum current
      exerts a motivational force on the reactants within the lattice
      increasing the potential of nuclear interaction with the newly
      created low-energy neutrons or neutron rich material.<br>
      <br>
      [0075] In systems using hydrogen as the reactant, the binding
      energy released in the creation of a &lt;2&gt;H nucleus (deuteron)
      is ~2.229 MeV. Deuterons are neutralized in the same process as
      single protons and the resulting &lt;2&gt;N mass interacts with a
      &lt;2&gt;H. The transition from &lt;2&gt;H to &lt;4&gt;H releases
      ~3.386 MeV. The largest yield of energy comes from the transition
      of &lt;4&gt;H via beta decay to &lt;4&gt;He yielding a total of
      ~22.965 MeV in the form of phonon creation and alpha particle
      radiation.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Heat Transfer Mechanisms</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0076] As shown schematically in FIG. 1, embodiments of the
      present invention contemplate a heat transfer mechanism (denoted
      with reference number 45). In some embodiments, where the core is
      submersed or otherwise in contact with a fluid, which functions as
      a reactant source, the same fluid can also function as the heat
      transfer mechanism. In cases where the reactant is H (protium) and
      the core is from the transition metal group, it is possible to use
      water with similar treatment as would be applied in traditional
      boilers. Other cores and reactants will likely work by applying
      the quantum current/quantum compression technique.<br>
      <br>
      [0077] Additional embodiments of useful reactors could include
      using a thermally but not electrically conductive support with a
      conductive core. By placing a gas source of reactant on the
      exposed side of the core and using electrolytic loading, the
      reaction could be initiated with resistive current heating of the
      core, with quantum currents, or a combination there of. A
      significant benefit of having a current flow in the core is the
      ability to use protium as the primary reactant. The core support
      would act as the heat sink and transfer the energy to what ever is
      desired, e.g., direct thermal conversion or a working fluid. The
      working fluid could be any gas or liquid down to and including the
      sea of electrons as discussed in [Kolawa2004].<br>
      <br>
      [0078] FIG. 7 shows an implementation where one or more surfaces
      of the core are in contact with the reactant source and one or
      more surfaces of the core are in contact with a separate heat
      sink. The heat sink can then transfer heat to a working fluid from
      which heat could be extracted, either as an end in and of itself,
      or to run a turbine. The geometry is shown schematically. For
      example, the core could be a layer of material on the inner
      surface of a thermally conductive but electrically insulating
      pipe, with the reactant introduced through the interior of the
      pipe and the heat withdrawn from the outside surface of the pipe.<br>

        and Control</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0079] Typical parameters are discussed, with specific quantities
      being described for a current demonstration reactor. The
      demonstration reactor is run at atmospheric pressure and uses a
      solution of sodium hydroxide in order to reduce the loading
      voltage requirement. A pressurized reactor would most likely
      eliminate the need for sodium hydroxide. This section frequently
      discusses a 10 nS timing resolution. This is because the current
      demonstration reactor uses a 100 MHz processor in the control
      system and this represents the available resolution. There is
      nothing fundamental about the 10 ns resolution.<br>
      <br>
      [0080] The Quantum Fusion reactor implemented by electrolysis and
      quantum current control is driven by the stimulation of phonons in
      a crystal lattice. Phonon stimulation is accomplished by
      stimulation event cycles consisting of a loading pulse and zero or
      more quantum current stimulation pulses.<br>
      <br>
      [0081] FIG. 8 is a representative timing diagram showing how the
      loading pulses and quantum current pulses can be controlled. The
      timing is characterized by a series of event cycles, one of which
      is shown in the figure.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">[0082] Event Cycles</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0083] An event cycle consists of a loading pulse and zero or more
      quantum current stimulation pulses. Loading pulses cause
      dissociation of the water into hydrogen and oxygen and promote the
      migration of hydrogen nuclei into the reaction matrix. Quantum
      current pulses stimulate phonons in the reaction matrix and ensure
      presence of electrons for electron capture. It may also be
      possible to use reverse polarity electrolysis pulsed to supply the
      reaction electrons if the core temperature is high enough to
      supply the required phonons without quantum current.<br>

      <br>
      [0085] In the initial reactor prototype the number of events is
      determinable by user configuration to allow optimization of the
      reaction characteristics and core start-up. Free run allows the
      reactor to proceed according to currently configured parameters
      (pursuant to the implementation of a feedback system).<br>

      dissipation of fusion-induced phonon energy. Longer event periods
      will allow more time between loading pulses and subsequent Quantum
      Fusion events. Currently due to hardware/software in use, events
      are being run at 1518.8 Hz or 658 [mu]S. This represents a 16-bit
      PWM with a 99.5328 MHz clock.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">[0088] Number of Quantum Pulses
        Per Event-0-250</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0089] This parameter allows optimization of energy production for
      various loading pulse amplitudes, durations, and temperature
      profiles. Varying the number of quantum pulses per event, allows
      the ratio of Quantum Fusion reaction rate and loading rate to be
      adjusted relative to one another. An analogy would be with
      multiple injection events per combustion cycle in an internal
      combustion direct injection engine. The current software/hardware
      implementing the reaction process is only capable of 140 pulses
      per event. The current demonstration reactor samples the loading
      current just after half of the number of pulses in the event have
      been instigated, in order to obtain the most accurate loading
      current used for calculation of the next pulse width setting.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">[0090] The Loading Pulse</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0091] The loading pulse causes dissociation of water into
      hydrogen and oxygen and promotes the migration of hydrogen nuclei
      into the reaction crystal matrix. Varying the pulse width relative
      to the amplitude allows the rate of dissociation to be controlled
      independent of the rate of loading.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">[0092] Loading Pulse
        Width-0.1%-100% (10 ns Resolution)</span><br style="font-weight:
        bold;">
      <br>
      [0093] The pulse width determines the length of time loading
      occurs. This is an indirect control on the density and depth of
      loading in the reaction matrix. This is roughly analogous to a
      choke or mixture setting on a carbureted engine. With the
      materials currently available for demonstration reactors, the
      process only produces easily detectable excess heat when run at
      80+% loading duty cycle. It is expected that efficiency of mass
      conversion will be much higher under increased pressure and
      temperature and thereby require the greatly extended range
      specified above.<br>
      <br>

        Amplitude-0-102.375 V (0.025V Resolution)</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0095] The pulse amplitude determines the rate of dissociation,
      and thus, the rate of fuel availability. As discussed above, the
      loading pulse under open container conditions must be in excess of
      80% duty cycle. The current demonstration reactor is isolating
      quantum pulses while the loading is at the same reference as the
      reactor control processor. The loading energy/current and duty
      cycle can be controlled by adjusting the loading voltage. The
      demonstration reactor is using sodium hydroxide and distilled
      water to provide a lower loading voltage requirement.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">[0096] Loading Pulse
        Offset-0-250,000 ns (25 ns Resolution)</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0097] This offset allows the start of the loading pulse to be
      varied relative to the start of the quantum pulse(s). This is
      roughly analogous to the spark timing in an internal combustion
      engine. This capability is still present in the current
      demonstration reactor but the reality is that the loading duty
      cycle in combination with the current quantum pulses being created
      must be at least 80% to achieve detectable amounts of excess heat.
      Current device appears to be converting on the order of 0.00014%
      or less of the H liberated in the electrolysis process. This is
      still easily detectable as the energy liberated at a loading
      current of 1.2 A is in excess of 10 W at that conversion rate.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">[0098] The Quantum Pulses</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0099] The ultimate purpose of the quantum current is the creation
      of free, low-energy, high-cross-section neutrons. The quantum
      pulses are responsible for initiating phonons in the reaction
      matrix, imparting additional energy to the system, filling
      available conduction and valance band orbitals to effect quantum
      compression, and increasing the density of electrons available for
      electron capture, and consequent low-energy, high-cross-section
      neutrons.<br>
      <br>
      [0100] According to quantum field theory, the potential energy of
      the Hamiltonian can be expressed in terms of fermion and boson
      creation and annihilation operators such that a set of processes
      is defined in which a fermion in a given eigenstate either absorbs
      or emits a boson (phonon), thereby being pushed into a different
      eigenstate. The change in eigenstate is the change of an Up quark
      to a Down quark, which changes a proton to a neutron.<br>
      <br>
      [0101] It is believed on the basis of the standard model theory
      that it is through the creation and absorption of phonons (bosons)
      that the energy induced as vibrations in the atomic lattice is
      translated to the nuclear scale, and by which the nuclear energy
      released by neutron absorption and transmutation is being
      dispersed as kinetic energy in the lattice. The phonons provide
      the scale coupling between electromagnetic force-level stimuli in
      the atomic lattice and the subatomic level increases in momentum.<br>
      <br>
      [0102] Quantum current supplies valence or conduction band
      electrons, providing the ~511 KeV electron mass. The quantum
      current is also responsible for raising the Hamiltonian energy of
      the reaction sites to the required ~782 KeV necessary for electron
      capture. This value represents the difference in mass between the
      proton-electron combination and the mass of the neutron.<br>
      <br>
      [0103] It is the intersection of these free neutrons with
      available hydrogen nuclei that comprises the fusion reaction path.
      The closest academically accepted reaction paths are the R-process
      and S-process, which occur in stars.<br>
      <br>
      [0104] A relatively low duty cycle of the quantum current pulses
      is typically required because effective quantum current pulse
      amplitude for a longer duty cycle would typically vaporize the
      core. There may be exceptions.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">[0105] Quantum Pulse Rate-3
        KHz-300 KHz (10 ns Resolution) and Quantum Pulse Amplitude-0-400
        V (0.2V Resolution)</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0106] The individual quantum pulses can be adjusted to tune the
      phonon creation and energy level. Phonons will also be generated
      as a product of Quantum Fusion events, leading to a lower phonon
      stimulation energy input requirement. The energy level requirement
      is a function of the macro temperature of the core as a whole, the
      loading rate, the geometry of the core, and the duration of the
      loading pulse, which partially determines loading depth. As seen
      in FIG. 3A, the quantum pulse amplitude is defined by voltage
      source 30 as controlled by signals at control input 55a, while the
      quantum pulse transitions are controlled by control inputs 55b and
      55c. The current demonstration reactor software Pulse Rate range
      is 19.5 KHz to 120.1 KHz.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">[0107] Quantum Pulse Dead
        Time-3.3 [mu]s-333 [mu]s (10 ns Resolution)</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0108] This parameter is a function of the circuit used to
      implement the quantum pulses and the loading rate. The pulse dead
      time also represents a division between quantum pulses whose
      direction through the core are alternated. This quantum pulse
      direction alternation provides for uniform loading of the core.
      Unidirectional quantum pulsing results in proton migration in the
      core, leading to a potential gradient in the core and non-uniform
      heating. It could also result in the eventual destruction of a
      metallic core as effective quantum pulses cause electro-migration
      of the atoms in order to generate the required Hamiltonian energy
      necessary to cause electron capture events/neutron generation. If
      the electro-migration is unidirectional the core will likely
      break.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">[0109] Quantum Pulse Offset-100
        ns-5000 ns (10 ns Resolution)</span><br style="font-weight:
        bold;">
      <br>
      [0110] This offset allows the start of the loading pulse to be
      varied relative to the start of the quantum pulse(s). This is
      roughly analogous to the spark timing in an internal combustion
      engine. It also allows the accurate collection of loading current
      data that is disturbed by the quantum pulses. This parameter has
      been replaced in the current demonstration reactor by limiting the
      frequency of quantum pulses although it could represent a delay
      factor of one pulse to enable the accurate collection of loading
      current data.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Reactor Feedback</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0111] Feedback parameters allow a commercially useful application
      of the reactor to be constructed with reaction parameters being
      adjusted in real time according to the dictates of energy demand
      on the system, changing pressure and temperature inside the
      reactor vessel.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">[0114] Loading Pulse Power</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0115] Loading pulse power feedback provides information on the
      water (sodium hydroxide solution in the current demonstration
      reactor) and inter-electrode environment. A large increase in
      loading pulse power can be indicative of excess phonon generation
      leading to a vapor envelope around the core impacting heat
      transfer away from the core. Operating under a constant loading
      power method aids in control of this problem. By sampling the
      loading current at the start of each cycle, the value may be
      overstated due to the nature of charge storage systems. It is
      better to collect this data in the middle of the cycle for
      calculating the loading power of the current cycle and use it to
      adjust future cycle widths.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">[0116] Quantum Pulse Power</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0117] The quantum pulse power feedback provides information on
      the state of core loading and possible core damage. The impedance
      of the core will change dependent upon the percentage of
      saturation of reactant in the core. Possible core damage will also
      lead to a persistent increase in quantum current energy due to
      increased resistance of the core. Impedance rise due to excessive
      loading density may necessitate a greater number of quantum pulses
      relative to loading pulses to alleviate the excessive loading
      condition. Sustained excess loading could lead to core degradation
      and/or destruction, through chained reactions leading to excess
      buildup of phonon energy.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Other Reactor Characteristics</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">[0118] Power Supply Voltage
        (Loading Pulse)</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0119] This sets the loading current magnitude (an earlier
      embodiment used a pulse transformer for loading, and this referred
      to the voltage on the primary of the pulse transformer). Pulse
      amplitude determines the rate of dissociation, and thus, the rate
      of fuel availability. There are upper limits to this function and
      care should be taken to not cause spallation of the core surface
      due to excessive instantaneous loading power. In palladium that
      appears to be ~4 A/mm&lt;2 &gt;although sustained loading of
      significantly less than this will cause destruction of a palladium
      core. The above number was found under conditions of loading
      current RMS values of less than 20 mA/mm&lt;2&gt;.<br>
      <br>
      [0120] In an open container the lower end of effective loading
      appears to be 240 mA/mm&lt;2 &gt;RMS. Care must also be taken in
      consideration of total electrical heating of the core and how it
      is mounted in the electrolytic solution. For example, the ends of
      the core should be insulated to prevent the solution from
      attacking the support structure, to prevent the support structure
      from absorbing the loading energy, and to prevent the effective
      removal of heat from the core material.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">[0121] Quantum Pulse Transformer
        Primary Voltage</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0122] This voltage allows the quantum current magnitude to be set
      from the primary side. The primary side is used to maintain
      isolation between the quantum current and the loading current.
      Using a center tapped magnetic device to couple the Quantum
      current energy to the core allows the core to be uniformly loaded.
      It is important to select a core able to handle the 500 MHz and
      above frequency content of effective quantum compression
      waveforms.<br>
      <br>
      [0123] RF transmission line transformers (TLTs) with a
      center-tapped secondary work well. In the demonstration reactor T8
      of FIG. 3C is using Indiana General Q1 type material Part number
      F626-12. The transformer is wound with a 4-turn primary and 4-turn
      center-tapped secondary using 120/38 SPN LITZ. The demonstration
      reactor uses source switched FETs in a half-bridge configuration
      (FIG. 3C U4, U5, U5A, U6, U6A) with a Metallized polyester film
      capacitor C5 to couple energy in to the primary.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Additional Implementations</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0124] Another method of using the reaction could include using a
      porous ceramic structure such as those offered by Foster Miller
      (see Karandikar1999, Karandikar1999-2). The shape of the porosity
      as well as the net shape can be specified. This material could be
      plated with the desired core material. It is believed that the
      best results using this type material would be achieved with a
      porosity designed to provide a uniform cross section for a quantum
      current activation. With this type of core the Quantum Fusion
      reaction will likely initiate at the points of maximum current
      density but spread as the temperature rises to the level necessary
      to supply the remaining phonons required for proton to neutron
      conversion in the rest of the core. This type of core material
      could be installed in a sealed container along the lines of those
      found in radioisotope thermoelectric generator (RTG), but without
      the dangerously radioactive core.<br>
      <br>
      [0125] One aspect of the present invention, alluded to in the
      preceding paragraph, is that a significant portion of the
      mechanical and thermodynamic infrastructure can be based on
      existing, commercially available technology. For example, a
      conventional 3-phase-electrode steam boiler, such as those
      available from Electric Steam Generator Corporation, 600 S. Oak
      St. (P.O. Box 21) Buchanan, Mich. 49107 Toll Free: (800) 714-7741,
      can be retrofitted with a Quantum Fusion core in the following
      manner: using a 3-phase electrode boiler, use two of the 3-phase
      electrodes for cathode connection, mounting a Quantum Fusion
      reactor core between them, allowing quantum current stimulation,
      and use the third electrode as the anode. Surprisingly, this is
      the only necessary mechanical modification to the device.<br>

        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0127] FIG. 9 is a schematic diagram of an experimental apparatus
      used to verify experimentally the generation of excess energy in
      the form of heat. In short, a technique for verifying the
      generation of excess heat uses a dual system with first and second
      nominally identical mechanical configurations, with each subsystem
      capable of driving either an active core or a dummy core (joule
      heater). Both subsystems are maintained within nominally identical
      environments. The two subsystems have identical beakers containing
      equal amounts of sodium hydroxide solution.<br>
      <br>
      [0128] The first subsystem is provided with the active core and
      the second subsystem is provided with a joule heater, and the
      subsystems are activated with the overall input electric power is
      controlled to be equal for both subsystems, and the temperatures
      of the two reaction vessels are measured over a period of time.<br>
      <br>
      [0129] It is expected that the temperatures in the two reaction
      vessels will begin to rise, if for no other reason, joule heating
      of the liquid. Both the active core and the dummy core act as
      immersion heaters. Due to heat losses arising from conduction and
      convection, the temperature of the liquid in each vessel
      ultimately reaches an equilibrium value.<br>
      <br>
      [0130] If joule heating were the only mechanism in play, the two
      vessels would be expected to reach the same equilibrium
      temperature given that they were being provided the same amount of
      electrical energy. If the first subsystem reached a higher
      equilibrium temperature, that could be considered an indication
      that excess heat beyond that attributable to the electrical energy
      being converted to heat was being generated.<br>

      [0133] The first three columns (excluding the date column)
      describe the quality of the quantum compression (abbreviated as
      "Q" in the table) waveforms. For the runs shown in the chart, the
      core was 0.05 mm diameter palladium wire. The core diameter is
      important in the determination of sizing and edge speed
      requirements for the quantum compression pulses. Instantaneous
      loading amps/mm&lt;2 &gt;and RMS loading amps/mm&lt;2 &gt;are the
      loading requirements and total amps are related to the surface
      area of the core in use.<br>
      <br>
      [0134] The power to the reactor and the joule heater were
      maintained at equal levels for comparison. Measuring the joule
      heater power was effected by using a standard power meter.
      Measuring the reactor power was done computationally, with
      separate computations for the loading power and the quantum
      compression power. In general, the bulk (75-90%) of the power to
      the reactor is the power of the loading portion of the circuit,
      with a smaller fraction for the quantum compression.<br>
      <br>
      [0135] The second December 5 run had no quantum pulses applied to
      the core, and the joule heater raised the water to a higher
      temperature. This reflects the fact that the joule heater
      transfers more of the input electrical power to the solution than
      does the loading circuit. The results of the December 18 and
      December 20 runs, which had sharper pulses than the first December
      5 run, are encouraging in that they strongly suggest the
      generation of excess heat due to the quantum compression pulses.<br>
