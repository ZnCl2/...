      <b>COMPLETE SPECIFICATION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Improvements in or relating to Laundry or Washing Appliances We,
      Robert Bosch G M B H, a German Company, of Breitscheidstrasse 4,
      Stuttgart, Germany, do hereby declare the invention, for which we
      pray that a patent may be granted to us, and the method by which
      it is to be performed, to be particularly described in and by the
      following statement:-<br>
      <br>
      The present invention relates to electrical appliances for
      producing oscillations or vibrations in liquids for laundry or
      washing purposes.<br>
      <br>
      It has already been proposed to clean material to be laundered or
      washed, especially underwear, by rapidly vibrating or oscillating
      the washing water, in which the material to be laundered is
      immersed, by means of a membrane or diaphragm which is immersed or
      plunged into the water, with the object of releasing and washing
      away particles of dirt or other foreign matter adhering to the
      material being laundered In a known washing device of this kind,
      the diaphragm is caused to vibrate rapidly by means of a small
      electric motor through a rod or bar to which the diaphragm is
      fitted The disadvantages of this device consist in the fact that
      revolving parts requiring the attention of an operator and subject
      to wear and tear, are provided for translating a rotary movement
      into the required oscillating or vibrating movement.<br>
      <br>
      It is also known to use ultra sound or supersonic waves for
      laundry purposes The production of such waves, however, requires
      devices which are too cumbersome and expensive for use in small
      laundry installations for domestic use Washing devices have also
      been proposed in which a diaphragm is excited by a solenoid in
      such a manner that the vibrations of the diaphragm are entirely
      unrestricted In practice, however, this vibratory effect of the
      diaphragm is insufficient for washing purposes and the washing
      devices so fitted are thus unsatisfactory.<br>
      <br>
      It is well known to construct audible warning devices such as
      horns with an electromagnetically operated diaphragm, the movement
      of which is limited in at least one direction by a stop.<br>
      <br>
      According to the present invention an electromagnetically operated
      liquid oscillating or vibrating laundry or washing appliance is
      characterised in that movement of a diaphragm operated by an
      electromagnet is abruptly limited in at least one direction by a
      stop and in that the electromagnetic driving means are enclosed in
      a casing sealed against the ingress of liquid by the diaphragm and
      provided with means to prevent undue pressure rise within the
      casing sufficient to prejudice the operation of the diaphragm.<br>
      <br>
      The invention is further described with reference to the
      accompanying drawings which illustrate by way of example eight
      embodiments of the invention, suitable for alternating current,
      and in which: <br>

      <br>
      In the appliance shown in Fig 1, 10 designates a metal diaphragm
      in the form of a circular disc In the centre of 'the disc is
      secured a bolt 11, with which a laminated ironbody 12 is firmly
      connected to constitute the armature of an electromagnet 13 A core
      14 of the magnet with a coil 15 is secured to a casing 16 of the
      appliance The diaphragm 10 is clamped between the edge of the
      casing 16 and a protective screen or lattice 17 -The diaphragm
      thus tightly seals the easing around its periphery The bolt 11 is
      carried at the end remote from the diaphragm in a plate spring 18
      clamped to the base of the casing A conduit or tube 19 is fitted
      to the casing and is co-axial with bolt 11 and so with -the
      magnet.<br>
      <br>
      Said tube 19 serves as the carrier of the appliance and also for
      the passage of the electricity supply flex to the coil of the
      magnet.<br>
      <br>
      When the appliance is connected with the electricity supply mains
      and set in operation, the electromagnet periodically draws and
      releases its armature 12 in the rhythm or frequency of the
      alternating current to and from the core 14 Such reciprocatory
      movement of the armature is transmitted to the diaphragm and a
      vibration of oscillation corresponding to twice the mains
      frequency is consequently imparted to the diaphragm The full
      vibratory or oscillatory movement which the diaphragm tends to
      cover when the armature 12 is actuated, is, however, not entirely
      utilised or exploited, the movement of the armature and so the
      diaphragm in -a direction towards the core 14 being in fact
      abruptly interrupted due to the armature 12 impinging upon the
      -core14 which thus constitutes a stop This impinging action causes
      the diaphragm to be jarred, i e, the shape of the vibration curve
      of the diaphragm is influenced in such a way that peak or harmonic
      vibrations of very high frequency having very sharp rise and fall
      are superimposed upon the basic vibration of the diaphragm.<br>
      <br>
      The curve of the acoustic pressure produced by such an apparatus
      is illustrated in Fig 12 part a The very steep waves A are
      produced by the armature striking the core of the electromagnet In
      part b there is illustrated, by way of comparison a sine-like
      curve of similar frequency and amplitude It can be easily seen
      from comparison of the two curves that the steepness of the waves
      A is considerably greater than the sine-like curve.<br>
      <br>
      The method of operation of the instrument or appliance when
      immersed in water is such that the molecules of the liquid
      entering the casing 16 via the screen or lattice 17 and 70 coming
      into contact with the outer side of the diaphragm are accelerated
      by the vibrations of the diaphragm The greatly accelerated water
      particles are particularly suitable for and capable of removing
      particles of dirt or other 75 foreign matter, which have already
      been loosened by the washing powder or other cleaning medium, from
      the fibre of the clothes or other material being laundered.<br>
      <br>
      In the example shown in Fig 2, two co go axially disposed
      diaphragms 25 and 26 are spaced apart and clamped or tensioned at
      opposite sides of a ring 27 together with respective screens or
      protective lattices 28 and 29 Both diaphragms are firmly connected
      85 with the excitation means so that the core 14 is firmly
      connected with the diaphragm 25 and the armature 12 of the
      electromagnet is irmly connected with the diaphragm 26 The carrier
      tube 19 is inserted into an aperture 30 9 o in the ring 27 and is
      secured therein.<br>
      <br>
      The example in Fig 3 differs from that of Fig 2 in that two
      diaphragms 31 and 32 are connected with respective armatures 33,
      34 of two electromagnets of which the respective 95 cores 35 and
      36 are secured on a plate or intermediate partition 38 firmly
      connected with and dividing the annular casing 37 of the
      appliance.<br>
      <br>
      In the example shown in Fig 4, an 100 additional vibratory body 40
      is disposed on a bolt 39 which is secured to the diaphragm 10 and
      carries the armature 12 Thus, body 40 is connected with the
      diaphragm by the -bolt -39.<br>
      <br>
      This additional vibratory body has its own 105 frequency of
      vibrations, which is substantially above that of the diaphragm 10
      The vibratory body 40 suspended in the middle of the diaphragm is
      in the form of a beam which tapers towards its ends It may also,
      however, 110 be constructed as a circular disc, which, as shown in
      Fig 5, is provided with annular corrugations Such additional
      vibrating or oscillating bodies are particularly suitable for
      superimposing heavy upper or harmonic vibra 115 tions upon the
      basic vibrations of the vibration system on the impinging of said
      vibration system.<br>
      <br>
      The appliance is very simple to use and may be operated as follows
      After the hot, or 120 preferably, boiling water, to which is added
      the usual washing agents, and the laundry have been, placed in the
      boiler 55 (Fig 6), and the appliance has been suspended in the
      boiler so that its entire casing is submerged below the 125 water
      level, the electric alternating current is switched on to cause
      the appliance to operate.<br>
      <br>
      For adjusting the depth to which the appliance is immersed, means
      such as an adjustable bearing ring 56 may be fitted to the carrier
      130 726,774 electrical losses of the driving system, the pressure
      above atmospheric so produced opens the non-return valve against
      the action of spring 250, thus compensating for the pressure
      difference in the casing relative to the 70 atmosphere Upon such
      compensation being effected, the valve is returned to its seat to
      seal the interior of the appliance against the admission of air
      from the atmosphere.<br>
      <br>
      Whilst the appliance remains in operation, 75 no pressure
      differences will occur between the interior of the casing and the
      atmosphere which may be sufficient to disturb the desired
      operation However, as soon as the appliance is further operated in
      cold water or is taken 80 out of the hot water, switched off, and
      placed in a cool place, it is possible, due to the airtight
      casing, for a pressure below atmospheric to occur in the interior
      of the casing which is sufficient to prevent the correct
      functioning of 85 the diaphragm, at least until the appliance has
      been sufficiently heated again It has, however, been found that a
      casing possessing the required airtight properties cannot be
      obtained by simple means, as, in the course of time, a go pressure
      compensation or balance takes place either by way of the cable
      cores or the cable passage, or by way of the valve.<br>
      <br>
      The example shown in Fig 9 omits the nonreturn valve of Figs 7 and
      8 but other means 95 is provided to ensure that the space enclosed
      by casing 16 and diaphragm 10 will conform to any alteration of
      the air pressure contained therein, without the difference between
      the pressure in the casing and the atmosphere 100 thereby assuming
      such proportions likely to interfere with the action of the
      appliance For this purpose there are fitted, as for instance to
      the interior of the casing wall, resilient or yielding hollow
      bodies 400, having a greater 105 flexibility than the diaphragm,
      which are formed in this example by bellow-like chambers 410 of
      thin sheet metal which are sealed from the interior of the casing
      by means of lids or covers 420, whilst the other end of 110 the
      bellow-like chambers are soldered or welded to the casing wall The
      casing wall has holes 430 which communicate with the interiors of
      the chambers.<br>
      <br>
      In lieu of such sheet metal chambers, sack 115 or bag-like
      bladders of rubber or similar materials may also be used as shown
      in Fig.<br>
      <br>
      in which a hollow body 400 a of this kind is provided with a small
      pipe piece 400 b which passes through the opening 430 of the 120
      casing wall The pipe piece has a flange 400 c which is pressed
      against the casing wall by means of a cap ring 400 d screwed to
      the casing.<br>
      <br>
      On increase of air pressure within the 125 casing, the bellows are
      compressed and thus the interior space in the casing is
      correspondingly enlarged Thus the pressure above atmospheric is
      limited to an extent which will not affect the action of the
      vibration producer 130 pipe 19 and which ring also serves to cover
      the aperture 57 in the lid 58 of the wash boiler, a fixing or
      clamp screw being carried by the ring to secure same in position
      The appliance is preferably connected with the main supply through
      an electrical transformer which reduces the potential to a value
      which is not dangerous for contact with the body An interrupter
      device of any suitable type may be built into the appliance so
      that the appliance may also be used on a direct current supply and
      a condenser may also be provided across the interrupter device.<br>
      <br>
      The vibrator or oscillation producer shown in Fig 7 consists of a
      metal diaphragm 10 in the form of a circular disc which is clamped
      at its outer edge to the casing 16 and connected hermetically with
      the casing by means of a packing ring 120 The laminated armature
      12 of the electromagnet 13 is fixed by means of the bolt 11 to the
      diaphragm in the centre thereof.<br>
      <br>
      An aperture 160 for bolt 11 is hermetically sealed by a packing
      disc 170 The core 14 of the electromagnet with the excitation coil
      15 is secured to a strut or bridge 20 fixed to the base of casing
      16.<br>
      <br>
      The tube or pipe 19 is inserted into the base of the casing and is
      preferably securely welded thereto A non-return valve 220 is
      provided at the free end of the pipe in order to prevent the
      admission of air from the atmosphere to the internal chamber or
      space of casing 16 The valve, which is shown in detail in Fig 8,
      has a valve disc 230 formed with a conical bearing surface 240
      which normally rests upon a correspondingly shaped seating surface
      formed at the end of pipe 19 and is pressed against this surface
      by a spring 250 which abuts against a cap nut 260 screwed on to a
      threaded collar fixed to this end of the pipe, the cap nut being
      provided with an aperture 270 for the passage of air This
      arrangement ensures that the entire area enclosed by the diaphragm
      10 and the casing 16 with -the pipe 19 is sealed against the
      admission of atmospheric air, whereby to avoid entry of moisture
      into the casing and which would otherwise have an undesirable
      effect on the So coil of the electromagnet.<br>
      <br>
      A feed cable 280 for the excitation coil 15 extends within the
      pipe 19 and passes out hermetically through a bore 290 formed in a
      nipple 300 screwed into the side of pipe 19 A packing ring 310 is
      located between the nipple and the pipe 19 The outer end of the
      nipple is formed with a funnel-shaped seating surface 320 for a
      rubber sealing ring 330 which is pressed by means of a cap nut 340
      against the seating surface and the cable 280 passing through it.<br>
      <br>
      When the appliance is used for instance in hot water, the air
      enclosed in the casing is considerably heated externally by the
      water surrounding the casing and internally by the 726,774 4
      726,774 A further example of the subject of the invention is shown
      semi-diagrammatically in Fig 11 In this case, the casing 520
      enclosing the electromagnet 13 is made as small as the dimensions
      of the electro-magnet permit in order that the space enclosed by
      the casing and the diaphragm 10 may be as small as possible As in
      the other examples, a pipe 19 is connected to the base of the
      casing for the li) passage of the electricity supply lead 280 to
      the electromagnet 13 of the appliance The free end of the pipe 19
      is in effect widened to form a chamber 530 which is located as
      remote as possible from casing 520 and is not immersed in the hot
      water during operation of the appliance As shown, the capacity of
      the chamber 530 greatly exceeds that of the casing 520, it may,
      for example, be twice as large as the capacity of the casing 520,
      in order to maintain low the pressure occurring in the casing 520
      on the heating of the air present therein This is achieved, as
      previously mentioned, by the fact that the casing 520, which is
      immersed in hot water when the appliance is operated, has a much
      smaller air capacity than the chamber 530 which thus remains
      considerably cooler than the casing, the latter being situated
      outside the water container When the air enclosed in the casing
      520 expands owing to heating, -it will mix with the cooler air in
      the pipe 19 and in the chamber 530 and the temperature rise
      relative to the atmospheric air, corresponding to the volume and
      temperature conditions of the two masses of air, will be
      considerably less than, the temperature rise which would obtain in
      the air in the casing 520 if the chamber 530 were not present.<br>

      <div align="center"><big><b>Dolfi is a tiny ultrasonic washing
            machine for delicate clothes</b></big><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Product designer Andre Fangueiro has created a small pebble-shaped
      device that uses ultrasonic sound waves to clean clothes (+
      movie).<br>
      <br>
      Andre Fangueiro, founder of Netherlands firm Studio Lata,
      partnered with engineers at Swiss firm MPI Ultrasonics and new
      company Dolfi to design a portable machine for washing textiles
      using ultrasound.<br>
      <br>
      The product – also called Dolfi – aims to remove the need for
      hand-washing clothes made from fabrics like silk, cashmere and
      lace that are easily damaged, as well as offer travellers a
      portable cleaning option.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      "The idea of Dolfi came after a few terrible experiences with
      laundry during my extensive travel," said Dolfi founder Lena
      Solis, who commissioned Fangueiro to design the product.<br>
      <br>
      "I believe that ultrasonic technology will change the way we
      wash," she added.<br>
      <br>
      According to the designers, once the Dolfi is placed in a sink or
      container filled with water and switched on, a device inside it
      known as a transducer converts electrical power into a range of
      high-frequency soundwaves that create millions of tiny bubbles in
      the liquid – an action known as cavitation.<br>
      <br>
      These bubbles implode in on themselves, generating jets that drive
      detergent and water through the fibres of a piece of clothing
      without the need for extra movement.<br>

      <br>
      Fangueiro created a smooth white plastic pebble to house the
      transducer. The pebble is sealed to make it waterproof and is
      attached to an electric power source via a flexible cable.<br>
      <br>
      "Its smooth form provides the end user with the sense of
      friendliness and security that this object would help wash their
      most precious textiles," said Fanguerio.<br>
      <br>
      "The curvature and acceleration of the surfaces are designed to
      communicate a high-end consumer product within its technological
      size. The end result is the small-size, hand-held product that is
      both high-tech and high-performing."<br>

      <br>
      Ultrasonic processes are widely used for cleaning objects made
      from more solid materials, like jewellery and dental equipment.<br>
      <br>
      Swiss company MPI Ultrasonics developed a range of frequencies
      that are suitable for cleaning textiles. MPI's Multifrequency,
      Multimode, Modulated Sonic &amp; Ultrasonic Vibrations technology
      can be used for a number of different purposes, as the waves it
      generates can be tuned to suit different materials and functions.<br>

      "The precisely modulated ultrasonic waves tackle dirt and bacteria
      right down to the microscopic level. This revolutionary method is
      able to clean clothing from the inside out without ever damaging
      or discolouring the fabric," said a statement from Dolfi.<br>
      <br>
      "This compact but powerful device consumes about 80 times less
      energy than a conventional washing machine, helping you make a
      huge positive impact for the planet and, of course, for your
      wallet."<br>

      <br>
      Dolfi's name is a "tribute to dolphins", animals the company
      describes as "the most advanced users of ultrasound".<br>
      <br>
      Dolfi will launch a crowdfunding campaign to raise $100,000
      (£66,000) for production of the device on online platform
      IndieGogo later this month. A portion of the funds will be donated
      towards dolphin research and welfare organisations.<br>

      </b><b>THANK YOU!</b><br>
      <br>
      A big THANKS to our almost 8000 contributors who made Dolfi a
      reality!<br>
      <br>
      We are now at the final stage of setting up for manufacturing and
      have stopped taking pre-orders.<br>
      <br>
      To avoid delays in shipping the rewards to our backers we have
      locked in the quantities for the first production batch and will
      not be offering pre-orders anymore.<br>
      <br>
      We’ll start taking orders again once we ship the rewards to our
      Indiegogo supporters.<br>
      <br>
      If you missed out on our campaign, subscribe HERE to be informed
      once Dolfi can be ordered!<br>
