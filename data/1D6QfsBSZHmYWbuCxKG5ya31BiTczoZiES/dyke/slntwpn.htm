              for Quiet Wars</font></b></p>

      <p>SWFQW is a politically biased technical instruction manual on
        how to justify, how to selectively survive, human animal
        husbandry before the need for animal husbandry becomes unstably
        critical.... </p>
      <p>In the spring of 2003 (issue 33), Paranoia excerpted a pamphlet
        entitled <i>Silent Weapons for Quiet Wars</i>, asking readers
        for any information they might have on the author of the work,
        which claimed to have been originally found in a surplus copy
        machine purchased in 1986 at McChord Air Force Base by a Boeing
        employee. The following December, Paranoia received a letter,
        mailed from a federal prison, from one Hartford Van Dyke,
        claiming to be the author of the work. Being confident that he
        is the true author of Silent Weapons (SWFQW), we wish to share
        letters from Hartford Van Dyke wherein he exposes the
        circumstances surrounding his authorship of this infamous
        pamphlet. </p>
      <p><i>Silent Weapons for Quiet Wars</i> contains a timeless,
        eternal message to human civilization to be eternally vigilant,
        to be well informed, to accept responsibility for the conditions
        of the world, to be sovereign, to appreciate the inner workings
        and thinking of Nature and Nature's God, to listen for that
        "still small voice," and to know that "Divine Mind always has
        met and always will meet every human need." (M.B.E.)... </p>
      <p>In the winter of 1974, I was going through some math books
        while researching a math problem (I think a problem on cubic
        equations), when I referred to my old college textbook College
        Algebra, by Lyman M. Kells of the US Naval Academy (1956 or
        1958). I came across the footnote in that book and noticed that
        they exactly corresponded to the ideas in Report from Iron
        Mountain. I had discovered the mathematical methodology of the
        Silent Weapons System, and I had the key to finding more
        information on the subject. I located Studies in the Structure
        of the American Economy at the Multnomah County library in
        Portland, Oregon... </p>
      <p>SWFQW is a collage, an overlay and paste-up of the works and
        words of many authors. I was the author only in the sense that I
        compiled and linked the gems of other writers. The book is not a
        hoax. Wassily W. Leontief proved the content of SWFQW by his
        article in the September 1980 issue of Scientific American,
        entitled "the world Economy in the Year 2000." Leontief was the
        father of the Silent Weapons System, and was awarded the 1973
        Nobel Prize in Economics long after his creation (1948) became
        recognized by the elite to be a weapon (1965).... </p>
      <p>The work on SWFQW began about October 1978 and was published in
        December 1979. Initially, about 65 copies of the book were sent
        out to various people and organizations. I do not know what
        happened to most of the copies, but I can fairly well account
        for one of them, which was given out by hand in early 1980. It
        was given to a military person, who was late for duty (or was
        going to be late), at McChord AFB in the state of Washington. He
        was hitchhiking through Vancouver on I-5 in uniform. Even though
        I was traveling in my own locality, I drove him to McChord (a
        two hour trip each way). On the way, I told him about the book
        SWFQW, and when he stepped out of the car to go onto the base I
        handed him a copy. I did not make any further general effort to
        publicize SWFQW until after 1986. I did give out copies to local
        friends between 1979 and 1986. </p>
      <p>In November 1986, the America's Promise Newsletter (APN) ran an
        advertisement for SWFQW. It claimed that a Boeing Aircraft
        employee bought a surplus copy machine at auction from McChord
        AFB and inside it he found a copy of SWFQW. It was very probably
        the copy that I gave to the hitchhiker. The Boeing employee
        passed the book along to the APN of Phoenix, AZ. From that time
        on SWFQW got the attention it deserved. It was a wake-up call to
        America, and perhaps even the world, if we can believe
        Leontief's Scientific American (Sept. 1980) article, "The World
        Economy in the Year 2000", wherein he says that by the year
        1973, the year he received the Nobel Prize in Economics, sixty
        nations were already using his system to analyze their
        economies. </p>
      <p>I am very grateful to William Cooper and APN for giving Silent
        Weapons for Quiet Wars to the world. </p>

          extensive objectives of social control and destruction of
          human life, i.e., slavery and genocide.</font> </p>

          analog declaration of intent. Such a writing must be secured

          whenever any person or group of persons in a position of great
          power and without full knowledge and consent of the public,
          uses such knowledge and methodologies for economic conquest -

      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Silent weapon technology has
          evolved from <i>Operations Research</i> (O.R.), a strategic
          and tactical methodology developed under the Military
          Management in England during World War II. The original
          purpose of Operations Research was to study the strategic and
          tactical problems of air and land defense with the objective
          of effective use of limited military resources against foreign
          enemies (i.e., logistics).</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was soon recognized by
          those in positions of power that the same methods might be
          useful for totally controlling a society. But better tools
          were necessary.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Social engineering (the
          analysis and automation of a society) requires the correlation
          of great amounts of constantly changing economic information
          (data), so a high-speed computerized data-processing system
          was necessary which could race ahead of the society and
          predict when society would arrive for capitulation.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Relay computers were to
          slow, but the electronic computer, invented in 1946 by J.
          Presper Eckert and John W. Mauchly, filled the bill.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next breakthrough was
          the development of the <i>simplex method</i> of linear
          programming in 1947 by the mathematician George B. Dantzig.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then in 1948, the
          transistor, invented by J. Bardeen, W.H. Brattain, and W.
          Shockley, promised great expansion of the computer field by
          reducing space and power requirements.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With these three inventions
          under their direction, those in positions of power strongly
          suspected that it was possible for them to control the whole
          world with the push of a button.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Immediately, the Rockefeller
          Foundation got in on the ground floor by making a four-year

      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1954 it was well
          recognized by those in positions of authority that it was only
          a matter of time, only a few decades, before the general
          public would be able to grasp and upset the cradle of power,
          for the very elements of the new silent-weapon technology were
          as accessible for a public utopia as they were for providing a
          private utopia.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The issue of primary
          concern, that of dominance, revolved around the subject of the
          energy sciences.</font> </p>
      <hr width="61%">
      <center>
        <p><a name="four"></a><b><font size="+1">Energy</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Energy is recognized as the
          key to all activity on earth. Natural science is the study of
          the sources and control of natural energy, and social science,
          theoretically expressed as economics, is the study of the
          sources and control of social energy. Both are bookkeeping
          systems: mathematics. Therefore, mathematics is the primary
          energy science. And the bookkeeper can be king if the public
          can be kept ignorant of the methodology of the bookkeeping.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All science is merely a
          means to an end. The means is knowledge. The end is control.
          Beyond this remains only one issue: Who will be the
          beneficiary?</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1954 this was the issue
          of primary concern. Although the so-called "moral issues" were
          raised, in view of the law of natural selection it was agreed
          that a nation or world of people who will not use their
          intelligence are no better than animals who do not have
          intelligence. Such people are beasts of burden and steaks on
          the table by choice and consent.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Consequently, in the
          interest of future world order, peace, and tranquillity, it
          was decided to privately wage a quiet war against the American
          public with an ultimate objective of permanently shifting the
          natural and social energy (wealth) of the undisciplined and
          irresponsible many into the hands of the self-disciplined,
          responsible, and worthy few.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to implement this
          objective, it was necessary to create, secure, and apply new
          weapons which, as it turned out, were a class of weapons so
          subtle and sophisticated in their principle of operation and
          public appearance as to earn for themselves the name "silent
          weapons."</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In conclusion, the objective
          of economic research, as conducted by the magnates of capital
          (banking) and the industries of commodities (goods) and
          services, is the establishment of an economy which is totally
          predictable and manipulatable.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to achieve a
          totally predictable economy, the low-class elements of society
          must be brought under total control, i.e., must be
          housebroken, trained, and assigned a yoke and long-term social
          duties from a very early age, before they have an opportunity
          to question the propriety of the matter. In order to achieve
          such conformity, the lower-class family unit must be
          disintegrated by a process of increasing preoccupation of the
          parents and the establishment of government-operated day-care
          centers for the occupationally orphaned children.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The quality of education
          given to the lower class must be of the poorest sort, so that
          the moat of ignorance isolating the inferior class from the
          superior class is and remains incomprehensible to the inferior
          class. With such an initial handicap, even bright lower class
          individuals have little if any hope of extricating themselves
          from their assigned lot in life. This form of slavery is
          essential to maintain some measure of social order, peace, and
          tranquillity for the ruling upper class.</font> </p>

      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It shoots situations,

          chemical reaction (explosion); originating from bits of data,
          instead of grains of gunpowder; from a computer, instead of a
          gun; operated by a computer programmer, instead of a marksman;
          under the orders of a banking magnate, instead of a military
          general.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It makes no obvious
          explosive noises, causes no obvious physical or mental
          injuries, and does not obviously interfere with anyone's daily
          social life.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet it makes an unmistakable
          "noise," causes unmistakable physical and mental damage, and
          unmistakably interferes with the daily social life, i.e.,
          unmistakable to a trained observer, one who knows what to look
          for.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The public cannot comprehend
          this weapon, and therefore cannot believe that they are being
          attacked and subdued by a weapon.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The public might
          instinctively feel that something is wrong, but that is
          because of the technical nature of the silent weapon, they
          cannot express their feeling in a rational way, or handle the
          problem with intelligence. Therefore, they do not know how to
          cry for help, and do not know how to associate with others to
          defend themselves against it.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When a silent weapon is
          applied gradually, the public adjusts/adapts to its presence
          and learns to tolerate its encroachment on their lives until
          the pressure (psychological via economic) becomes too great
          and they crack up.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, the silent weapon
          is a type of biological warfare. It attacks the vitality,
          options, and mobility of the individuals of a society by
          knowing, understanding, manipulating, and attacking their
          sources of natural and social energy, and their physical,

      </center>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the study of energy
          systems, there always appears three elementary concepts. These
          are potential energy, kinetic energy, and energy dissipation.
          And corresponding to these concepts, there are three
          idealized, essentially pure physical counterparts called
          passive components.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the science of physical
          mechanics, the phenomenon of <i>potential energy</i> is
          associated with a physical property called elasticity or
          stiffness, and can be represented by a stretched spring.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In electronic science,
          potential energy is stored in a capacitor instead of a spring.
          This property is called capacitance instead of elasticity or
          stiffness.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the science of physical
          mechanics, the phenomenon of <i>kinetic energy</i> is
          associated with a physical property called inertia or mass,
          and can be represented by a mass or a flywheel in motion.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In electronic science,
          kinetic energy is stored in an inductor (in a magnetic field)
          instead of a mass. This property is called inductance instead
          of inertia.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the science of physical
          mechanics, the phenomenon of <i>energy dissipation</i> is
          associated with a physical property called friction or
          resistance, and can be represented by a dashpot or other
          device which converts energy into heat.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In electronic science,
          dissipation of energy is performed by an element called either
          a resistor or a conductor, the term "resistor" being the one
          generally used to describe a more ideal device (e.g., wire)
          employed to convey electronic energy efficiently from one
          location to another. The property of a resistance or conductor
          is measured as either resistance or conductance reciprocals.</font>
        <br>
        <font size="-0">In economics these three energy concepts are
          associated with:</font> </p>
      <blockquote><font size="-0"><u>Economic Capacitance</u> - Capital
          (money, stock/inventory, investments in buildings and
          durables, etc.)</font> <br>
        <font size="-0"><u>Economic Conductance</u> - Goods (production
          flow coefficients)</font> <br>
        <font size="-0"><u>Economic Inductance</u> - Services (the
          influence of the population of industry on output)</font></blockquote>
      <font size="-0">All of the mathematical theory developed in the

          discovered was the basic principle of power, influence, and
          control over people as applied to economics. That principle is
          "when you assume the appearance of power, people soon give it
          to you."</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Rothschild had
          discovered that currency or deposit loan accounts had the
          required appearance of power that could be used to induce
          people (inductance, with people corresponding to a magnetic
          field) into surrendering their real wealth in exchange for a
          promise of greater wealth (instead of real compensation). They
          would put up real collateral in exchange for a loan of
          promissory notes. Mr. Rothschild found that he could issue
          more notes than he had backing for, so long as he had
          someone's stock of gold as a persuader to show his customers.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Rothschild loaned his
          promissory notes to individual and to governments. These would
          create overconfidence. Then he would make money scarce,
          tighten control of the system, and collect the collateral
          through the obligation of contracts. The cycle was then
          repeated. These pressures could be used to ignite a war. Then
          he would control the availability of currency to determine who
          would win the war. That government which agreed to give him
          control of its economic system got his support.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Collection of debts was
          guaranteed by economic aid to the enemy of the debtor. The
          profit derived from this economic methodology mad Mr.
          Rothschild all the more able to expand his wealth. He found
          that the public greed would allow currency to be printed by
          government order beyond the limits (inflation) of backing in
          precious metal or the production of goods and services.</font>

          presented as a pure element called "currency," has the
          appearance of capital, but is in effect negative capital.
          Hence, it has the appearance of service, but is in fact,
          indebtedness or debt. It is therefore an economic inductance
          instead of an economic capacitance, and if balanced in no
          other way, will be balanced by the negation of population
          (war, genocide). The total goods and services represent real
          capital called the gross national product, and currency may be
          printed up to this level and still represent economic
          capacitance; but currency printed beyond this level is
          subtractive, represents the introduction of economic
          inductance, and constitutes notes of indebtedness.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; War is therefore the
          balancing of the system by killing the true creditors (the
          public which we have taught to exchange true value for

      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Rothschild had

          the airframe which either vibrations of the engine or <i>aeolian





            vibrations</i> of the wings, or a combination of the two,
          might reinforce resulting in a resonant self-destruction of
          the airframe in flight as an aircraft. From the standpoint of
          engineering, this means that the strengths and weaknesses of
          the structure of the airframe in terms of vibrational energy

      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To use this method of
          airframe shock testing in economic engineering, the prices of
          commodities are shocked, and the public consumer reaction is
          monitored. The resulting echoes of the economic shock are
          interpreted theoretically by computers and the psycho-economic
          structure of the economy is thus discovered. It is by this
          process that <i>partial differential and difference matrices</i>
          are discovered that define the family household and make
          possible its evaluation as an economic industry (dissipative

          extension of a natural energy system. It, also, has its three
          passive components. Because of the distribution of wealth and
          the lack of communication and lack of data, this field has
          been the last energy field for which a knowledge of these
          three passive components has been developed.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since energy is the key to
          all activity on the face of the earth, it follows that in
          order to attain a monopoly of energy, raw materials, goods,
          and services and to establixh a world system of slave labor,
          it is necessary to have a first strike capability in the field
          of economics. In order to maintain our position, it is
          necessary that we have absolute first knowledge of the science
          of control over all economic factors and the first experience

      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Economics, as a social
          energy science has as a first objective the description of the
          complex way in which any given unit of resources is used to
          satisfy some economic want. (Leontief Matrix). This first
          objective, when it is extended to get the most product from
          the least or limited resources, comprises that objective of
          general military and industrial logistics known as Operations
          Research. (See simplex method of linear programming.)</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The <i>Harvard Economic
            Research Project</i> (1948-) was an extension of World War
          II <i>Operations Research</i>. Its purpose was to discover
          the science of controlling an economy: at first the American
          economy, and then the world economy. It was felt that with
          sufficient mathematical foundation and data, it would be
          nearly as easy to predict and control the trend of an economy
          as to predict and control the trajectory of a projectile. Such
          has proven to be the case. Moreover, the economy has been
          transformed into a guided missile on target.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The immediate aim of the
          Harvard project was to discover the economic structure, what
          forces change that structure, how the behavior of the
          structure can be predicted, and how it can be manipulated.
          What was needed was a well-organized knowledge of the
          mathematical structures and interrelationships of investment,
          production, distribution, and consumption.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To make a short story of it
          all, it was discovered that an economy obeyed the same laws as
          electricity and that all of the mathematical theory and
          practical and computer know-how developed for the electronic
          field could be directly applied in the study of economics.
          This discovery was not openly declared, and its more subtle
          implications were and are kept a closely guarded secret, for
          example that in an economic model, human life is measured in
          dollars, and that the electric spark generated when opening a
          switch connected to an active inductor is mathematically
          analogous to the initiation of war.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The greatest hurdle which
          theoretical economists faced was the accurate description of
          the household as an industry. This is a challenge because
          consumer purchases are a matter of choice which in turn is
          influenced by income, price, and other economic factors.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This hurdle was cleared in
          an indirect and statistically approximate way by an
          application of shock testing to determine the current
          characteristics, called current technical coefficients, of a
          household industry</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, because problems in
          theoretical electronics can be translated very easily into
          problems of theoretical electronics, and the solution
          translated back again, it follows that only a book of language
          translation and concept definition needed to be written for
          economics. The remainder could be gotten from standard works
          on mathematics and electronics. This makes the publication of
          books on advanced economics unnecessary, and greatly
          simplifies project security.</font> </p>

      </center>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An ideal industry may be
          symbolized electronically in various ways. The simplest way is
          to represent a demand by a voltage and a supply by a current.
          When this is done, the relationship between the two becomes
          what is called an admittance, which can result from three
          economic factors: (1) foresight flow, (2) present flow, and
          (3) hindsight flow.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Foresight flow</i> is the
          result of that property of living entities to cause energy
          (food) to be stored for a period of low energy (e.g., a winter
          season). It consists of demands made upon an economic system
          for that period of low energy (winter season).</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a production industry it
          takes several forms, one of which is known as production stock
          or inventory. In electronic symbology this specific industry
          demand (a pure capital industry) is represented by capacitance
          and the stock or resource is represented by a stored charge.
          Satisfaction of an industry demand suffers a lag because of
          the loading effect of inventory priorities.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Present flow</i> ideally
          involves no delays. It is, so to speak, input today for output
          today, a "hand to mouth" flow. In electronic symbology, this
          specific industry demand (a pure us industry) is represented
          by a conductance which is then a simple economic valve (a
          dissipative element).</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hindsight flow</i> is
          known as habit or inertia. In electronics this phenomenon is
          the characteristic of an inductor (economic analog = a pure
          service industry) in which a current flow (economic analog =
          flow of money) creates a magnetic field (economic analog =
          active human population) which, if the current (money flow)
          begins to diminish, collapse (war) to maintain the current
          (flow of money - energy).</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Other large alternatives to
          war as economic inductors or economic flywheels are an
          open-ended social welfare program, or an enormous (but
          fruitful) open-ended space program.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The problem with stabilizing
          the economic system is that there is too much demand on
          account of (1) too much greed and (2) too much population.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This creates excessive
          economic inductance which can only be balanced with economic
          capacitance (true resources or value --- e.g., in goods or
          services).</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The social welfare program
          is nothing more than an open-ended credit balance system which
          creates a false capital industry to give nonproductive people
          a roof over their heads and food in their stomachs. This can
          be useful, however, because the recipients become state
          property in return for the "gift," a standing army for the
          elite. For he who pays the piper picks the tune.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Those who get hooked on the
          economic drug, must go to the elite for a fix. In this, the
          method of introducing large amounts of stabilizing capacitance
          is by borrowing on the future "credit" of the world. This is a
          fourth law of motion --- onset, and consists of performing an
          action and leaving the system before the reflected reaction
          returns to the point of action - a delayed reaction.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The means of surviving the
          reaction is by changing the system before the reaction can
          return. By this means, politicians become more popular in
          their own time and the public pays later. In fact, the measure
          of such a politician is the delay time.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The same thing is achieved
          by a government by printing money beyond the limit of the
          gross national product, and economic process called <i>inflation</i>.
          This puts a large quantity of money into the hands of the
          public and maintains a balance against their greed, creates a
          false self-confidence in them and, for awhile, stays the wolf
          from the door.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They must eventually resort
          to war to balance the account, because war ultimately is
          merely the act of destroying the creditor, and the politicians
          are the publicly hired hit men that justify the act to keep
          the responsibility and blood off the public conscience. (See
          section on consent factors and social-economic structuring.)</font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the people really cared
          about their fellow man, they would control their appetites
          (greed, procreation, etc.) so that they would not have to
          operate on a credit or welfare social system which steals from
          the worker to satisfy the bum.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since most of the general
          public will not exercise restraint, there are only two
          alternatives to reduce the economic inductance of the system.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let the populace bludgeon
          each other to death in war, which will only result in a total
          destruction of the living earth.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Take control of the world by
          the use of economic "silent weapons" in a form of "quiet
          warfare" and reduce the economic inductance of the world to a
          safe level by a process of benevolent slavery and genocide.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The latter option has been
          taken as the obviously better option. At this point it should
          be crystal clear to the reader why absolute secrecy about the
          silent weapons is necessary. The general public refuses to
          improve its own mentality and its faith in its fellow man. It
          has become a herd of proliferating barbarians, and, so to
          speak, a blight upon the face of the earth.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They do not care enough
          about economic science to learn why they have not been able to
          avoid war despite religious morality, and their religious or

      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In recent times, the
          application of <i>Operations Research</i> to the study of the
          public economy has been obvious for anyone who understands the
          principles of shock testing.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the shock testing of an
          aircraft airframe, the recoil impulse of firing a gun mounted
          on that airframe causes shock waves in that structure which
          tell aviation engineers the conditions under which some parts
          of the airplane or the whole airplane or its wings will start
          to vibrate or flutter like a guitar string, a flute reed, or a
          tuning fork, and disintegrate or fall apart in flight.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Economic engineers achieve
          the same result in studying the behavior of the economy and
          the consumer public by carefully selecting a staple commodity
          such as beef, coffee, gasoline, or sugar, and then causing a
          sudden change or shock in its price or availability, thus
          kicking everybody's budget and buying habits out of shape.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They then observe the shock
          waves which result by monitoring the changes in advertising,
          prices, and sales of that and other commodities.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The objective of such
          studies is to acquire the know-how to set the public economy
          into a predictable state of motion or change, even a
          controlled self-destructive state of motion which will
          convince the public that certain "expert" people should take
          control of the money system and reestablish security (rather
          than liberty and justice) for all. When the subject citizens
          are rendered unable to control their financial affairs, they,
          of course, become totally enslaved, a source of cheap labor.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not only the prices of
          commodities, but also the availability of labor can be used as
          the means of shock testing. Labor strikes deliver excellent
          tests shocks to an economy, especially in the critical service
          areas of trucking (transportation), communication, public
          utilities (energy, water, garbage collection), etc.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By shock testing, it is
          found that there is a direct relationship between the
          availability of money flowing in an economy and the real
          psychological outlook and response of masses of people
          dependent upon that availability.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, there is a
          measurable quantitative relationship between the price of
          gasoline and the probability that a person would experience a
          headache, feel a need to watch a violent movie, smoke a
          cigarette, or go to a tavern for a mug of beer.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is most interesting that,
          by observing and measuring the economic models by which the
          public tries to run from their problems and escape from
          reality, and by applying the mathematical theory of <i>Operations





            Research</i>, it is possible to program computers to predict
          the most probable combination of created events (shocks) which
          will bring about a complete control and subjugation of the
          public through a subversion of the public economy (by shaking
          the plum tree).</font> </p>

              Economic Amplifiers</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Economic amplifiers are the
          active components of economic engineering. The basic
          characteristic of any amplifier (mechanical, electrical, or
          economic) is that it receives an input control signal and
          delivers energy from an independent energy source to a
          specified output terminal in a predictable relationship to
          that input control signal.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The simplest form of an
          economic amplifier is a device called advertising.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If a person is spoken to by
          a T.V. advertiser as if he were a twelve-year-old, then, due
          to suggestibility, he will, with a certain probability,
          respond or react to that suggestion with the uncritical
          response of a twelve-year-old and will reach into his economic
          reservoir and deliver its energy to but that product on
          impulse when he passes it in the store.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An economic amplifier may
          have several inputs and output. Its response might be
          instantaneous or delayed. Its circuit symbol might be a rotary
          switch if its options are exclusive, qualitative, "go" or
          "no-go", or it might have its parametric input/output
          relationships specified by a matrix with internal energy
          sources represented.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whatever its form might be,
          its purpose is to govern the flow of energy from a source to
          an output sink in direct relationship to an input control
          signal. For this reason, it is called an active circuit
          element or component.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Economic Amplifiers fall
          into classes called strategies, and, in comparison with
          electronic amplifiers, the specific internal functions of an
          economic amplifier are called logistical instead of
          electrical.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, economic
          amplifiers not only deliver power gain but also, in effect,
          are used to cause changes in the economic circuitry.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the design of an economic
          amplifier we must have some idea of at least five functions,
          which are:</font> </p>
      <blockquote><font size="-0">the available input signals</font> <br>
        <font size="-0">the desired output-control objectives,</font> <br>
        <font size="-0">the strategic objective,</font> <br>
        <font size="-0">the available economic power sources,</font> <br>
        <font size="-0">the logistical options.</font></blockquote>
      <font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The process of defining and
        evaluating these factors and incorporating the economic
        amplifier into an economic system has been popularly called <i>game





          theory</i>.</font>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The design of an economic
          amplifier begins with a specification of the power level of
          the output, which can range from personal to national. The
          second condition is accuracy of response, i.e., how accurately
          the output action is a function of the input commands. High
          gain combined with strong feedback helps to deliver the
          required precision.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most of the error will be in
          the input data signal. Personal input data tends to be
          specified, while national input data tends to be statistical.</font>

      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next step in the process
          of designing an economic amplifier is discovering the energy
          sources. The energy sources which support any primitive
          economic system are, of course, a supply of raw materials, and
          the consent of the people to labor and consequently assume a
          certain rank, position, level, or class in the social
          structure, i.e., to provide labor at various levels in the
          pecking order.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each class, in guaranteeing
          its own level of income, controls the class immediately below

      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As time goes on and

          of the good things that the upper-class members have. They

      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If this rise of the lower

      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Until such energy dominance
          is absolutely established, the consent of people to labor and

      </center>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Few efforts of human
          behavior modification are more remarkable or more effective
          than that of the socio-military institution known as the
          draft. A primary purpose of a draft or other such institution
          is to instill, by intimidation, in the young males of a
          society the uncritical conviction that the government is
          omnipotent. He is soon taught that a prayer is slow to reverse
          what a bullet can do in an instant. Thus, a man trained in a
          religious environment for eighteen years of his life can, by
          this instrument of the government, be broken down, be purged
          of his fantasies and delusions in a matter of mere months.
          Once that conviction is instilled, all else becomes easy to
          instill.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even more interesting is the
          process by which a young man's parents, who purportedly love
          him, can be induced to send him off to war to his death.
          Although the scope of this work will not allow this matter to
          be expanded in full detail, nevertheless, a coarse overview
          will be possible and can serve to reveal those factors which
          must be included in some numerical form in a computer analysis
          of social and war systems.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We begin with a tentative
          definition of the draft:</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The draft (selective
          service, etc.) is an institution of compulsory collective
          sacrifice and slavery, devised by the middle-aged and elderly
          for the purpose of pressing the young into doing the public
          dirty work. It further serves to make the youth as guilty as
          the elders, thus making criticism of the elders by the youth
          less likely (Generational Stabilizer). It is marketed and and
          sold to the public under the label of "patriotic = national"
          service.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once a candid economic
          definition of the draft is achieved, that definition is used
          to outline the boundaries of a structure called a Human Value
          System, which in turn is translated into the terms of game
          theory. The value of such a slave laborer is given in a Table
          of Human Values, a table broken down into categories by
          intellect, experience, post-service job demand, etc.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some of these categories are
          ordinary and can be tentatively evaluated in terms of the
          value of certain jobs for which a known fee exists. Some jobs
          are harder to value because they are unique to the demands of
          social subversion, for an extreme example: the value of a
          mother's instruction to her daughter, causing that daughter to
          put certain behavioral demands upon a future husband ten or
          fifteen years hence; thus, by suppressing his resistance to a
          perversion of a government, making it easier for a banking
          cartel to buy the State of New York in, say, twenty years.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such a problem leans heavily
          upon the observations and data of wartime espionage and many
          types of psychological testing. But crude mathematical models
          (algorithms, etc.) can be devised, if not to predict, at least
          to predeterminate these events with maximum certainty. What
          does not exist by natural cooperation is thus enhanced by
          calculated compulsion. Human beings are machines, levers which
          may be grasped and turned, and there is little real difference
          between automating a society and automating a shoe factory.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These derived values are
          variable. (It is necessary to use a current Table of Human
          Values for computer analysis.) These values are given in true
          measure rather than U.S. dollars, since the latter is
          unstable, being presently inflated beyond the production of
          national goods and services so as to give the economy a false
          kinetic energy ("paper" inductance).</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The silver value is stable,
          it being possible to buy the same amount with a gram of silver
          today as it could be bought in 1920. Human value measured in
          silver units changes slightly due to changes in production
          technology.</font> </p>

          however, be conditioned to accept the transition to "reality"
          when it comes, or sooner.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp; As the transition becomes more
          difficult to manage, the family unit must be carefully
          disintegrated, and state-controlled public education and
          state-operated child-care centers must be become more common
          and legally enforced so as to begin the detachment of the
          child from the mother and father at an earlier age.
          Inoculation of behavioral drugs [Ritalin] can speed the
          transition for the child (mandatory). Caution: A woman's
          impulsive anger can override her fear. An irate woman's power
          must never be underestimated, and her power over a
          pussy-whipped husband must likewise never be underestimated.

      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp; The emotional pressure for
          self-preservation during the time of war and the self-serving
          attitude of the common herd that have an option to avoid the
          battlefield --- if junior can be persuaded to go - is all of
          the pressure finally necessary to propel Johnny off to war.
          Their quiet blackmailings of him are the threats: "No
          sacrifice, no friends; no glory, no girlfriends."</font> </p>
      <p><i><font size="-0">Factor V --- Sister</font></i> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp; And what about junior's sister?
          She is given all the good things of life by her father, and
          taught to expect the same from her future husband regardless
          of the price.</font> </p>

      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp; Those who will not use their
          brains are no better off than those who have no brains, and so
          this mindless school of jelly-fish, father, mother, son, and
          daughter, become useful beasts of burden or trainers of the
          same.</font> </p>
