        <p><b><font size="+1">An Alternative Determination for the
              Velocity of Light</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p><b>I. Introduction ~</b>
      </p>
      <p>The nature of light and its velocity has always been a somewhat
        controversial
        subject and remains so to some extent even today. The disputed
        pointes
        of view are well-known to most readers of New Energy news and
        thus they
        will not be extensively considered here. However, some of the
        more salient
        points will be briefly stated ere as a prelude to a discussion
        of an alternate
        method of determining the velocity of light in the vacuum.
      </p>
      <p>Primarily, light is presently considered to be a wave motion in
        terms
        of electromagnetic theory, but it is also considered as an
        energy unit
        or photon in quantum theory. The aspects compliment each other;
        for example,
        the wave theory is generally applied to interactions between
        light signals,
        while quantum theory is used for light energy interactions, such
        as the
        photoelectric effect. Presently, the velocity of light is
        considered as
        absolute, <i>i.e</i>., independent of the velocity of the
        source or the
        observer. Also the physical motion of any material body can
        never exceed
        the velocity of light. The velocity of light also serves as a
        connection
        between mass and energy as is noted in the well-known relation E
        = mc<sup>2</sup>.
        The velocity of light appears in many physical relations,
        especially those
        relating to the various fundamental constants of nature. Thus,
        the determination
        of the true value of this velocity is of utmost importance in
        physics and
        in cosmology in general.
      </p>
      <p><b>II. Experimental Determinations of the Velocity of Light ~</b>
      </p>
      <p>The first crude measurement (of importance) of the velocity of
        light
        was made by Roemer in 1675 in an experiment where he noted a
        change of
        time for the observance of the eclipsing of the moon Io by the
        planet Jupiter.
        The velocity determined here was in the order of 2.2 x 10<sup>10</sup>
        cm/sec using the best parameters available to him at that time.
        However,
        since that time many more precise experimental measurements were
        made,
        as summarized in the 1983 paper by Pipkins and Ritter (1). Most
        of these
        determinations were in the order of 3 x 10<sup>10</sup> cm/sec,
        with the
        average being around 2.9979 x 10<sup>10</sup> cm/sec. The more
        recent measurements
        made around 1973 or so, gave a value of 2.9979245 x 10<sup>10</sup>
        cm/sec,
        and this was the accepted value at that time. This generally
        remains the
        present day value, as given in some dictionaries of science (2)
        and the
        book <i>Gravitation</i> by Misner, Thorne, and Wheeler (3).
      </p>
      <p>It should be noted that most of the above experimental
        measurements
        of the velocity of light were made in the presence of gases,
        primarily
        air and possibly water vapor, and thus does not truly represent
        the velocity
        in vacuum. However, the error introduced is considered to be
        very minimal.
        Here. However, I will consider the accepted value to be 2.99792
        x 10<sup>10</sup>
        cm/sec, out to five decimal places only, so as to be of the
        sameorder of
        magnitude as for some of the other determined constants which
        will be used
        in the alternate calculations. Before doing so it is necessary
        to digress
        a bit to explain the nature of Planck’s Natural Units, which are
        basic
        to these determinations.
      </p>
      <p><b>III. Planck’s Natural Units (PNU) ~</b>
      </p>
      <p>Max Planck published in 1914 a curious aside in his book <i>The
          Theory
          of Heat Radiation</i>. I first became aware of this aside in
        1959, when
        Dover Publications released a reprint of this volume (4). Planck
        suggested
        that experimentally determined universal constants could be used
        to “establish
        units of length, mass, time, and temperature, which are
        independent of
        special bodies or substances, which necessarily retain their
        significance
        for all times and for all environments, terrestrial and human or
        otherwise,
        and which may, therefore, be described as ‘natural units’”.
        Planck chose
        the constants h, his Planck constant, C, the velocity of light
        in vacuum,
        and G, the gravitational constant. Planck expressed the
        numerical values
        of these constants in the CGS system of units,<i> i.e.</i>,
        centimeters,
        grams, and seconds. By choosing the natural units so that each
        of the above
        constant assumes the value unity, he obtained the natural units:
      </p>
      <p>Length = L* = ( G h / C<sup>3</sup> )<sup>½</sup> <u>~</u>
        3.99
        x 10<sup>–33</sup> cm
      </p>
      <p>Time = T* = ( G h / C<sup>5</sup> ) ½ <u>~</u> 1.33 x 10 <sup>–43</sup>
        sec.
      </p>
      <p>Mass = M* = ( C h / G ) ½ <u>~</u> 5.37 x 10<sup>–5</sup> gm
      </p>
      <p>Using the data available to him at that time.
      </p>
      <p>A paper by McNish which appeared in May 1959 (5) seemed to
        relish the
        potentials stated by Planck but expressed concern about the
        uncertainty
        of arriving at a sufficiently accurate value for the
        gravitational constant.
        However, it occurred to me at that time that these natural units
        could
        perhaps be the dimensions of the aether, but pressures of
        earning a living
        and raising a family delayed my looking into this further at
        this time.
        However, in 1975 I was able to devote a few months to further
        studies in
        cosmology, primarily a fresh look at the nature and structure of
        space/time,
        the so-called aether. I was encouraged by reports on a
        ‘structure’ for
        the vacuum as was given by Misner, Thorne, and Wheeler (MTW) in
        their book
        (3). Especially interesting to me was their revision of Planck’s
        natural
        units (PNU), using the reduced Planck Constant, <strike>h</strike>,
        rather
        than h, since this was in agreement with my own ‘structuring’ of
        a stationary
        aether. This I had reported later in my monograph, <i>Rhysmonic
          Cosmology</i>,
        which I released in 1985 (6). As a result, the PNU now became:
      </p>
      <p>L* <u>~</u> 1.6161 x 10<sup>-33</sup> cm
      </p>
      <p>T* <u>~</u> 5.3906 x 10<sup>-44</sup> sec.
      </p>
      <p>M* <u>~</u> 2.1765 x 10<sup>-5</sup> gm
      </p>
      <p>Where the calculations were carried out to the most probable
        fourth
        decimal place, using
      </p>
      <p>C <u>~</u> 2.9979 x 10<sup>10</sup> cm/sec
      </p>
      <p>G <u>~</u> 6.6732 x 10<sup>-8</sup> cm<sup>3</sup>/gm sec<sup>2</sup>
      </p>
      <p><strike>h</strike> ~ 1.0546 x 10-27 gm cm<sup>2</sup>/sec
      </p>
      <p>where these values were averaged from the references cited
        here. Since
        C, G, and <strike>h</strike> can eventually be experimentally
        determined
        to higher orders of accuracy, the Planck Natural Units will also
        be determined
        more accurately in the future.
      </p>
      <p><b>IV. Application of PNU to the Velocity of Light ~</b>
      </p>
      <p>In Rhysmonic Cosmology (6) the velocity of light in vacuum was
        predicted
        to be due to a matrix-type structure from the vacuum. Here,
        electromagnetic
        effects were the result of a propagation factor, C*, could be
        called the
        Planck Velocity, and was equal to L* / T*. Substituting in the
        more recent
        determinations of the Planck natural units,
      </p>
      <p>C* = L* / T* = 2.99794 x 10<sup>10</sup> cm/sec,
      </p>
      <p>Which also is the experimentally determined velocity of light.
        It is
        surprising that this connection has not been mentioned by the
        quantum theorists
        (as far as I know) and especially by MTW. Therefore, it seems to
        me that
        the PNU really do describe the structure of the aether. In the
        above relation
        it is seen that the velocity of light would be constant in an
        undisturbed
        aether. The only way the velocity could change is if L* changes
        (which
        is possible in the presence of matte where the velocity would be
        reduced),
        or if T* changes, which some experiments could ascertain).
      </p>
      <p><b>V. The PNU and Dimensional Analysis ~</b>
      </p>
      <p>Since PNUs appear to describe the very structure of a
        stationary aether
        they may be truly fundamental units. As such, one can refine the
        experimentally
        determined fundamental constants with dimensional formula
        analysis. Two
        examples are give:
      </p>
      <p><strike>h</strike> ~ 1.0545 x 10<sup>-27</sup> gm/sec<sup>2</sup>
        (from
        experiment)
      </p>
      <p>The numerical value of h can be determined from PNU thus,
      </p>
      <p>h* = gm cm2/sec = M* L*2 / T* ~ 1.05449.
      </p>
      <p>Therefore,
      </p>
      <p><strike>h</strike> <u>~</u> 1.05449 x 10<sup>-27</sup> gm cm<sup>2</sup>/sec
(from
        PNU).
      </p>
      <p>Also,
      </p>
      <p>G <u>~</u> 6.673 x 10<sup>-8</sup> cm3/gm sec2 (from
        experiment, Ref.
        1)
      </p>
      <p>G* = cm<sup>3</sup>/gm sec<sup>2</sup> = L*3 / M* T*<sup>2</sup>
        <u>~</u>
        6.6736
      </p>
      <p>Therefore,
      </p>
      <p>G <u>~</u> 6.6736 x 10<sup>-10</sup> cm<sup>3</sup>/gm sec<sup>2</sup>
        (per PNU).
      </p>
      <p>This technique was verified for many known constants, but with
        one notable
        exception: the value of, e, the quantum of charge.
      </p>
      <p>e <u>~</u> 4.803 x 10<sup>-10</sup> (gm cm<sup>3</sup>/sec<sup>2</sup>)
        <sup>1/2</sup>&nbsp;
        (from experiment).
      </p>
      <p>Dimensionally,
      </p>
      <p>e* = (gm cm<sup>3</sup> / sec<sup>2</sup>)<sup>1/2</sup> = (M*
        L*<sup>3</sup>
        / T*<sup>2</sup> )<sup>1/2</sup> = 5.6226
      </p>
      <p>Thus,
      </p>
      <p>e <u>~</u> 5.6226 x 10<sup>-10</sup> (gm cm3 /sec<sup>2</sup>
        )<sup>1/2</sup>
        (per PNU).
      </p>
      <p>Note that the PNU determined value of e is about 11.7 times
        larger than
        the classical experimentally determined value. This also
        explains why the
        so-called reciprocal fine structure constant, 1 / alpha, where e<sup>2</sup>
        is used, becomes the value 11.7 2 or approximately 137. Thus,
        thus PNU
        determination of e questions the experimentally determined value
        of e,
        the quantum of charge.
      </p>
      <p><b>VI. Conclusions</b>
      </p>
      <p>The methods of Rhysmonic Cosmology (6) were basically used in
        the determination
        reported herein (with support from PNU and MTW). This material
        appears
        to confirm that there is a stationary aether, having a definite
        structure
        and very high energy content, probably related to the PNU and
        its many
        derivatives. The further study of this structure should interest
        many reader
        of <i>New Energy News</i> (NEN) and may possibly provide some
        clues to
        a more direct ‘extraction’ of the latent energy in space/time.
        As reported
        in NEN, this energy source might have been tapped in some past
        and current
        experimental tests. To unambiguously do so may provide the total
        energy
        needs of mankind in the future without polluting the earth. The
        writer
        hopes that many readers will consider the possibilities allude
        to herein.
