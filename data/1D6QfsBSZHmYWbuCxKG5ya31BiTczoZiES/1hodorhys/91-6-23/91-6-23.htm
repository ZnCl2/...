      <p style="margin-right:.5in;margin-left:.5in">Dear Colleague:
      </p>
      <p style="margin-right:.5in;margin-left:.5in">This may be of
        interest to
        you.
      </p>
      <p style="margin-right:.5in;margin-left:.5in">Gravitational signal
        astronomy
        techniques have been described by the writer in the April 1986
        issue of
        <i>Radio-Electronics</i>
        and the January 1989 issue of <i>R-E</i>'s <i>Electronic
          Experimenter Handbook</i>,
        as well as in some other publications. Some unpublished material
        was made
        available through Rex Research Archives. This material provides
        for an
        exciting new "window" to our Universe and is of significant
        importance
        since the gravity signals are essentially "instantaneous"
        signals and thus
        arrive in real time, i.e., the signals display activity in the
        Universe
        which is occurring <u>now</u>! In particular, catastrophic
        events in our
        own Milky Way galaxy, if of sufficient magnitude, could have an
        effect
        on the earth's weather patterns and geological structures. This
        is believed
        to be due to "gravity winds" which are generated by such events
        and such
        winds could alter the normal gravity of the earth.
      </p>
      <p style="margin-right:.5in;margin-left:.5in">The writer has
        ascertained
        (using these techniques) that on about December 6, 1986, a
        relatively minor
        "black-hole-type" structure noted at the Milky way center had
        "cannibalized"
        another close-by structure there to become a <u>new</u> much
        more massive
        black hole and accretion ring structure there. It was
        immediately reported
        to the National Science Foundation and some local media that the
        strong
        "turbulent gravity winds" noticed at this time could possibly
        have an effect
        on the earth's weather patterns and geological structures, as
        well as on
        the solar system and the galaxy in general. It is believed that
        the winds
        "spawned" at the same time, a local supernova, possibly the star
        Betelgeuse
        in Orion, leaving a black hole structure there which is seen to
        the present
        day! One does not need to be reminded of the strange weather
        patterns seen
        since that time or the increase in earthquakes!
      </p>
      <p style="margin-right:.5in;margin-left:.5in">The <u>new</u>
        black hole
        and ring structure in the galaxy center has been relatively
        stable since
        its creation in December 1986. It was still observed to be
        stable in a
        "scan" made on September 11, 1990. However, a scan made on May
        16, 1991
        had indicated that the center "hole" may have become somewhat
        unstable,
        showing evidence of two (possibly three) minor explosions since
        the last
        observation of September 11, 1990. Moreover, a scan made on June
        4, 1991,
        showed a violent explosion occurring there at the time of this
        scan. Talk
        about serendipity! The l/f noise detectors revealed a tremendous
        increase
        in turbulent winds at this time! The intense winds could affect
        the earth
        much more than the event of December 1986! A scan of the Center
        was made
        the next day and it appeared to show that the massive black hole
        and some
        other structures at the center had disappeared leaving what
        appeared to
        be debris there. The scans were repeated for the next few days,
        and sporadically
        for the next two weeks --- all confirmed that the new black hole
        and ring
        structure as well as some other long-standing structure there
        had <u>really</u>
        disappeared from the center!
      </p>
      <p style="margin-right:.5in;margin-left:.5in">A number of earth
        "events"
        occurring since June 4th may be related to the new strong
        gravity winds
        caused by this latest catastrophe at the center. For on this
        same day,
        a violent volcano erupted in Japan, with some evidence that
        others appeared
        to have increased activity also. A few days later, a long
        dormant volcano
        in the Philippines erupted, and also some others were showing
        possible
        increased activity. The sun also showed major sunspot activity
        after June
        4th! Again, a number of earthquakes were reported soon after
        June 4th.
        World-wide weather was most unusual, with increased wet and dry
        spells,
        higher than normal temperatures here in the eastern USA, and
        increased
        tornados and monsoons. The writer expects the earth will be in
        for a spate
        of unusual weather and increased volcano and earthquake activity
        for some
        time yet.
