      <p><b>A. Background</b>
      </p>
      <p>Rhysmonics (and Newton) assumed that the rhysmoid (aether if
        you wish)
        is relatively ‘fixed’in space and thus a reference to a movement
        with respect
        to that structure has meaning. There have been many attempts to
        measure
        this so-called aether ‘flow’ in the past. Rhysmonics appears to
        offer some
        evidence of such a ‘flow’ using a very simple circuit.
      </p>
      <p><b>B. Circuitry</b>
      </p>
      <p>The effects on a charge in a planar capacitor oriented with
        respect
        to the rotation of the earth on its axis should show some
        evidence of low-level
        voltage changes due to such a ‘flow’. These low level voltage
        changes would
        require very low loss, i.e., a very high impedance, for the
        input of the
        measuring circuit, typically some sort of voltmeter. Most
        ordinary voltmeters
        (even digital types) would excessively load the capacitor
        charge. However,
        a simple IC unity gain voltage follower circuit would provide a
        very high
        input resistance but would also be able to drive a typical low
        impedance
        (low cost) meter directly. Such a simple circuit is shown below:
      </p>
      <p>IC<sub>1</sub>: OP-90 used (others ok)
        <br>
        M: 0-1 mA (F.S. = 1000 mV)
        <br>
        C<sub>1</sub>: .04 uF ceramic (~ 3/4 x 1-1/4)
        <br>
        R<sub>1</sub>: 200 MOhm (load)
        <br>
        V: 1.5 V
      </p>
      <p><b>C. Operation</b>
      </p>
      <p>The OP-90 IC in this circuit has a very high input resistance
        (order
        of several thousand MOhms) but it is loaded down with a 200 MOhm
        resistor
        to keep the developed charge in C<sub>1</sub> (due to G-field
        flux effects)
        from rising to saturation levels. With a +/1 1.5 V supply, I
        found the
        capacitor used would charge to the order of 650 mV. However,
        with the flat
        face of the capacitor marked *, when oriented as indicated
        below, numerous
        tests at the initial charge stabilization point indicated the
        following
        results:
      </p>
      <p>Capacitor Flux Orientation&nbsp;&nbsp; //&nbsp; V Out
      </p>
      <p>N-S&nbsp;&nbsp; = 630 mV
        <br>
        E-W* = 640 mV
        <br>
        W-E* = 620 mV
      </p>

      <p><b>Notes</b>
      </p>
      <p>1. Orientation of the capacitor face * along the N-S (S-N)
        direction
        was immaterial and the output voltage remained constant at about
        630mV.
      </p>
      <p>2. With the capacitor face * in the west direction, the output
        voltage
        was constant at 10 mV higher.
      </p>
      <p>3. With the capacitor face * in the east direction, the output
        voltage
        was 10 mV lower
      </p>
      <p>4. This variation is in the order of +/- 1.5% which is
        significant.
      </p>
      <p><b>D. Conclusions</b>
      </p>
      <p>1. Care must be taken that the N-S reference voltage is
        constant and
        no excessive cosmic G-field effects were present.
      </p>
      <p>2. The test results seem to show that the capacitor was sensing
        an additional
        G-field flux in the E-W and W-E orientation which either added
        to or subtracted
        from the nominal N-S levels.
      </p>
      <p>3. It is surmised that the changes in the capacitor charge
        levels may
        have been related to aether ‘flow’ effects due to the capacitor
        movement
        in the fixed ‘aether’ as a function of the earth’s rotation.
      </p>
      <p>4. Again, while my tests are generally done ‘quickly’, I
        believed them
        to be valid. However, confirmation (or invalidation) by others
        is always
        appreciated.
