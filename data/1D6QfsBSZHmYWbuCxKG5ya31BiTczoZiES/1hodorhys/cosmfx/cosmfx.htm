    <blockquote><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Abstract ~</font></b>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A simple circuit for
          detecting what
          could be gravitational waves of a new kind is described. The
          energy distribution
          and frequencies of the detected pulses appear to be similar to
          that seen
          in "flicker" or "l/f" noise in electron devices. It is,
          therefore, postulated
          that the true source of l/f noise could be these cosmological
          effects.
          Of interest to the circuit designer is the possibility of
          cancellation
          or reduction of l/f noise in low frequency circuits. Of
          interest to the
          astrophysicist is a possible new "window" to the universe. The
          simplicity
          of the circuits and the minimal equipment requirements should
          enable many
          independent investigations into the reported phenomenon.</font>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The low frequency behavior
          of most
          electron devices is characterized by noise which has a
          Gaussian amplitude
          distribution as well as a power spectrum which is inversely
          proportional
          to frequency, giving rise to the names "flicker noise" and
          "l/f noise"
          for this noise. Much effort has been expended in studies of
          this noise
          and the statu as of 1970 was reviewed by van der Ziel (Ref.
          1). A more
          recent attempt to explain l/f noise was made by Stoisek and
          Wolf (Ref.
          2) who improved on earlier attempts but still left open the
          question of
          the true source of this noise. This letter presents a new
          approach to the
          origin of l/f noise which is based upon the author’s original
          work in cosmology
          (Ref. 3) as well as a background in solid state and thermionic
          electronics.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A basic concept in the
          author’s cosmology
          is the premise that sub-phenomena particles (which he now
          calls "rhysmons"
          after the original Greek technical term for atoms) form a
          matrix structure
          which is the very fabric of the universe. Modifications to
          this structure
          result in the myriad manifestations of nature, including the
          effects known
          as the electric field, the magnetic field, <u>and</u> the
          gravitational
          field. The early experiments by the author (1975) were
          intended to prove
          that under certain conditions, the electric field and the
          gravitational
          field were indistinguishable. An experiment was devised in
          which loosely
          bound electrons in the dielectric of a capacitor were to be
          "polarized"
          by gravitational "perturbation" effects introduced by sharply
          bringing
          a localized mass up to the capacitor. This would induce a
          small movement
          of charge in the capacitor giving rise to a small current, i<sub>1</sub>,
          as shown in <b><a href="#fig1">Figure (1a)</a></b>. This
          would be equivalent
          to the small movement of charge caused by the application of a
          small external
          electric field to the capacitor as shown in <b><a
              href="#fig1">Figure (1b)</a></b>.
          The gravitational effect was possible in terms of the author’s
          cosmology.
          To detect the very small charge movements, a very sensitive
          current detector
          was required. The advent of the integrated circuit operational
          amplifier
          provided such a current detector. The circuit which was
          developed is extremely
          simple and is shown in <b><a href="#fig2">Figure (2)</a></b>.
          IC<sub>1</sub>
          is a current-to-voltage converter in which the output voltage,
          V<sub>1</sub>,
          is equal to i<sub>1</sub>R<sub>1</sub> where i<sub>1</sub> is
          the current
          pulse developed in capacitor C<sub>1</sub> and R<sub>1</sub>
          is the feedback
          resistor of the circuit. R<sub>2</sub> is a level control for
          the buffer
          amplifier stage IC<sub>2</sub> which has a voltage gain of 20.
          For the
          values shown, a current pulse of one nanoampere (10<sup>-9</sup>
          amp) in
          C<sub>1</sub> can develop 25 mV at output, V<sub>2</sub>. This
          output is
          more than adequate to drive most pulse analyzers, audio
          amplifiers, oscilloscopes,
          or other recording device.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Original tests used a large
          capacitor
          (15,000 uF for C<sub>1</sub>, thus a large input time constant
          (the intrinsic
          input impedance of IC<sub>1</sub> is in the order of 3.2 k
          ohms) necessitated
          use of a zero-center voltmeter for the recording device. Test
          results were
          dramatic, but it was later ascertained that Doppler effects
          introduced
          by the presence of a strong local FM radio station were
          masking the results.
          When the input capacitor was reduced to 10 uF, perturbation
          effects now
          "rang" the circuit at about 45 cps with a decay time of 1-2
          seconds. The
          recording device in this case was a low noise audio amplifier.
          However,
          it was observed that a low-level background pulsating ringing
          persisted
          even though perturbation tests were halted. First impressions
          were that
          the background ringing was due to neighborhood arcings, as
          appliances were
          turned on and off, since the circuit was also extremely
          sensitive to short
          electromagnetic pulse effects. Reduction of C<sub>1</sub> to 1
          uF not only
          increased the natural frequency of the rings, but also
          increased the intensity
          and the number of bursts being detected. It was ascertained at
          this time
          that the source of the detected signals was very much external
          to the environment.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Another concept in the
          author’s cosmology
          inferred that gravitational collapse, such as supernova,
          should create
          a <u>new</u> kind of gravitational wave front (not the same
          as predicted
          in General Relativity) which would appear to the detector
          dielectric element
          as equivalent to an alternating electric field. According to
          current supernova
          theory (Ref. 4), this gravitational pulse should be Gaussian
          in amplitude,
          have a frequency in the order of 1 kc, and have burst periods
          in the order
          of 3-100 milliseconds. These bursts, according to the author’s
          cosmology,
          would also reach <u>any</u> portion of the universe in about
          10<sup>-44</sup>
          seconds, i.e., the pulses would be received in real time.
          Using an approximation
          of about one supernova per galaxy per 300 years, and about
          90-100 billion
          galaxies in the universe, it was estimated that 10-15 bursts
          per second
          from supernova effects was reasonable. To optimize the
          detection of such
          bursts, the input capacitor was reduced to 0.22 uF in order to
          ring the
          circuit at about 500 cps for a broad resonance with such
          effects. It was
          now possible to ring the circuit with the perturbation mass of
          a pin point
          as shown in <b><a href="#fig1">Figure (1a)</a></b>. The
          entire circuitry
          was double-shielded in an aluminum box within another steel
          box to eliminate
          electromagnetic fields from affecting the detector. Strong
          burst-type pulses
          continued to be detected, even when additionally shielded
          within another
          steel cabinet. These pulses have been continually observed by
          the author
          ever since the first experiments in 1975. many detectors have
          been built
          by the author, some by select colleagues, and all detectors
          performed similarly.
          In multiple detector tests, coincidence of bursts was noted.
          The observed
          bursts are Gaussian in amplitude and are in the order of 3-100
          milliseconds
          long. A typical single sweep of bursts as seen on an
          oscilloscope is shown
          in
          <b><a href="#fig3">Figure (3)</a></b>. The burst amplitudes
          are an inverse
          function of the frequency of the bursts, i.e., the greater the
          amplitude,
          the lower the frequency of such bursts. Relative amplitude and
          frequency
          of detected bursts is plotted in <b><a href="#fig4">Figure
              (4a)</a></b>.
          The typical response of l/f noise in transistors (Ref. 5) is
          ploted in
          <b><a href="#fig4">Figure
              (4b)</a></b> for comparison. The similarity in plots is
          quite evident.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The response of the detector
          as averaged
          by a digital voltmeter at output, V2, is shown in <b><a
              href="#fig5">Figure
              (5)</a></b>. This rough plot was made over a 24-hour
          period on May 10,
          1981. For one earth revolution, the response is seen to be
          slightly anisotropic.
          Even with averaging, structure is seen in this plot, although
          only the
          major variations are shown. The peaks and dip recorded at 9:30
          pm was roughly
          correlated with the autumn equinox at 12h right ascension,
          located in the
          Virgo region near the zenith at this time. This structure in
          the detector
          response moved about 4 minutes earlier each day and was
          followed for several
          weeks, and thus appears to confirm the observation that the
          burst response
          of the detector was related to our location on earth with
          respect to the
          rest of the universe. A tentative explanation for this
          response, in terms
          of the author’s cosmology, was made that (1), the universe is
          finite and
          spherical in shape, (2), the universe has a hard-core center
          of galaxies,
          and (3), the earth is located appreciably off-center in this
          scheme. The
          response also suggests an alternate explanation for the
          microwave background
          radiation detected by Penzias and Wilson.</font>

      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Conclusions ~</font></b>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A simple circuit for the
          detection
          of what could be gravitational waves of a new kind has been
          described.
          Sources for these waves could be supernova, novae, star
          quakes, etc., and
          the detected energy distribution and frequencies of such
          events are approximately
          as that expected (Ref. 7). The energy distribution and
          frequencies also
          closely approximate those seen in flicker or l/f noise in
          electron devices.
          It is, therefore, postulated that l/f noise in electron
          devices is being
          generated by these gravitational wave fronts in a manner
          similar to that
          ascribed to this detector.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The author is developing
          many technological
          uses for this circuit; cancellation or reduction of l/f noise,
          for example.
          In cosmology, the author is developing many new or alternate
          explanations
          for cosmological effects; the nature of electromagnetic wave
          propagation,
          for example. However, the possible correlation of l/f noise
          with cosmological
          effects given here should be of great interest to society
          members and others.
          The experiments are extremely simple and much of the author’s
          data can
          be verified readily.</font>
