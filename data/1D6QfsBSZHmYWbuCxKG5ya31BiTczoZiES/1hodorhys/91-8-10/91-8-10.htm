      <p style="margin-right:.5in;margin-left:.5in">It had come to the
        attention
        of the writer that many would-be researchers in GW detection
        techniques
        may have been discouraged by the tendency of some circuits to
        develop instabilities
        or oscillations at the high gain levels. This was particularly
        true when
        recently made IC devices were used. These instabilities are
        believed to
        be due to scalar-type signal feedback from the output circuitry
        to the
        input capacitor detection device. Such feedback could be
        circumvented to
        some extent by the use of a small capacitance, say less than 500
        pF, across
        the detector section feedback resistance --- but such
        "degeneration" also
        results in significant loss of conversion gain. However, a
        simple "fix"
        was reported to me recently by Bill Ramsay. Bill has found out
        that a small
        resistance in the order of 47 ohms, in series with the input
        detector capacitance,
        appears to stabilize many IC devices! The writer has evaluated
        this and
        verified it to be very effective in "squelching" the unwanted
        feedback!
        To make the fix more versatile (for many devices), the writer
        has made
        the resistor variable, by using a subminiature trimpot of 1k
        ohms as shown
        in <b>Figure 1</b>. This was desirable, since some preliminary
        tests indicated
        that anywhere from 27 ohms to over 500 ohms may be needed for
        certain IC
        devices for an adequate measure of stability.

      <p style="margin-right:.5in;margin-left:.5in">Use of a small
        resistance
        for the input detection device is also effective as a GW
        detection unit
        as was shown in Figure 6 of the <i>R-E Electronic Experimenter
          Handbook</i>
        article of January 1989. However, signals generated by a
        capacitative and
        a resistive detection unit are 180° out-of-phase in the output.
        Thus,
        any scalar-type signal developed in the output will also be 180°
        out-of-phase
        with the strong GW signal developed by the main input
        capacitance and thus
        the system will tend to "degenerate" rather than "regenerate" at
        the high
        input levels and thus not go into instabilities or oscillations.
        There
        would not be any loss of conversion gain in this process.

      <p style="margin-right:.5in;margin-left:.5in">Preliminary tests by
        Bill
        Ramsay seem to indicate that the units can be driven to higher
        sensitivity
        and gain levels without noticeable (?) distortions present. A
        few tests
        by the writer appear to confirm this. Perhaps some of you more
        active researchers
        may want to try to confirm this also? The GW detectors may now
        be even
        more versatile and useful now with this simple revision ---
        thanks to Bill
        Ramsay.
