      <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">To
          confirm
          the reality of the scans of Cygnus H and the redeveloping
          "structure" at
          the Galaxy Center, these scans were repeated on 7-21-1993. As
          the plots
          of Figure (1) show, these "events" were largely duplicated.
          The galaxy
          Center response is essentially unchanged, but Cygnus H has
          changed somewhat
          --- but this was expected since the Rustrak 2-D plots seemed
          to indicate
          that this "event" was possibly two black holes in rapid close
          orbit around
          each other. This investigation was begum because we speculated
          that perhaps
          some "new" massive cosmic event might be generating fairly
          strong "gravity
          winds" which in some way were affecting the jet stream in the
          northern
          hemisphere. There was also a possibility that the rotating
          "holes" seen
          in the Rustrak plots were relatively close in the Cygnus area
          and may have
          had a phase relationship with the earth's rotation which could
          be keeping
          its maximum effect pointed toward a particular 40-42<sup>o</sup>
          North
          Latitude location and which is only very slowly moving across
          the Earth
          (in this case the USA?). To further look into this, I went
          over some past
          2-D Rustrak scans I had remaining here.</font></div>

        <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">To begin with, I went over a
          2-D
          scan I made continuously from about 2-11-1992 to 2-28-1992
          with a Circuit
          #3000-A. Unfortunately, I used the later portions of this
          chart as actual
          scan samples sent to interested colleagues. However, I did
          check the remaining
          portions of this chart to see if there was any record of
          Cygnus H on it.
          I was very much surprised! On 2-15-1992, the chart appeared to
          indicate
          that there were two separate black holes in this particular
          region of Cygnus
          but were fairly far apart, about 8-10 minutes of Earth
          rotation time. However,
          on 2-16-1992, these "holes" appeared to have come closer
          together! On 2-19-1992
          they were much closer. On 2-20-1992 they were very close, just
          about abutting.
          On 2-21-1992 they appeared to be coalescing! On the morning of
          2-23-1992
          they appeared to have coalesced, and on the evening of that
          day the scan
          appeared to show a new larger structure there with a
          pronounced shock wave
          ring present! Unfortunately, I could not go further here as
          that was the
          end of my chart record here -- the other portions are with
          various colleagues
          out there. I am retaining this section, uncut, for further
          study and future
          reference.</font></div>

      <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The
          information
          here is for your interest only. It may or may not be relevant
          to the present
          Midwest flood problems. I will not pursue this further for the
          present,
          except that I may make a 2-day run on the earth g-field on the
          Rustrak
          to see if my g-field variation is now associated with Cygnus.
          Perhaps some
          of you may do more? The equipment I used for these tests are
          described
          in the Jan. 1989 issue of <i>Radio-Electronics Electronic
            Experimenter</i>.
          Any GW gravimeter designed to monitor fairly rapid GW signals
          is okay to
          use. Use of simple analog-type (meter-type) chart recorder,
          such as the
          Esterline-Angus units, is recommended for "fast" scans.
          Potentiometric
          or servo type recorders have fast responses and thus also
          record much superfluous
          and thus annoying "fine structure". The inertia of the meter
          type recorders
          tend to filter out much of that excessively fine response.</font>
