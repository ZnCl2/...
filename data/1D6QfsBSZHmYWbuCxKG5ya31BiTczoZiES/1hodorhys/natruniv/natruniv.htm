<p><b>Abstract:</b>
<p>The methods of Rhysmonic Cosmology are used to develop a plausible explanation
as to the nature and development of Our Universe. The purely intellectual
development of the theory is further enhanced with some experimental confirmations
which were derived from this theory. It is shown that much of the experimental
data agreed quite well with present-day observational material, and also
agreed very well with data as predicted by this theory. With the foundations
laid here, mankind should be able to further develop a knowledge of Our
Universe, both for the benefit of mankind, as well as sate the quest for
answers to the reason ‘why’ for the existence of men in this, Our Universe.
<p><b>Introduction:</b>
<p>Many theories have been advanced concerning the nature and the development
of Our Universe. There is no question that our Universe has been of concern
to mankind from the very beginnings of the development of intellectual
reasoning in man. The wonderful beauty and complexity o life and nature
here on earth has inspired mankind, in general, to look toward a Supernatural
Force or Supreme Being as the Prime Cause of such Existence. Unfortunately,
much of the attributes given to such a Supreme being were but ‘human attributes’,
and thus the many theological explanations for the nature and development
of Our Universe simply reflected a particular group’s reflections of itself
and its own mores. However, with the development of the scientific method,
most present day attempts to understand the nature of Our Universe are
divorced from thse local mores and proceed on a purely intellectual basis,
but many still recognize the need for a Prime Cause for this Existence.
<p>It was only recently, in the 1920s, that mankind finally realized that
Our Universe was very much vaster than had been previously imagined, mainly
by the optical detection of other galaxies which were ‘island universes’
in their own right and thus separate from our originally recognized Milky
Way galaxy ‘universe’. Developments in physics and astronomy have proceeded
rapidly since that time, leading to two general approaches to the nature
of Our Universe: the ‘Steady State’ and ‘Big Bang’ universes.
<p>The steady state universe reflects the belief that the Universe is,
has been, and always will be, and seeks to back that up with scientific
theory and evidence. The big bang universe reflects the belief, in a way,
of an ‘instantaneously’ created universe from a very small and very dense
‘mass’ which has since expanded to our present day size. There is some
question, yet, as to whether this is a one-way process, or an oscillatory
process, leading to an eventual contraction, or ‘Big Crunch’, and then
to a renewed big bang.
<p>The steady state universe has lost ground in recent years to the big
bang version in the development of Our Universe, mainly due to the apparent
‘expansion’ noted in our Universe (in terms of the so-called red shift
effect). This essay, however, will attempt to show that Our Universe is
basically a steady-state universe and that the expansion noted by the big
bang advocates is rally based on a ‘false physics’ for the red shift effect.
Rhysmonic Cosmology, as developed by the author, makes no pretense as to
the nature and source of the ‘rhysmons’ which fundamentally make up this
Universe, and thus must also invoke the need for a Prime Cause. However,
on the basis oft his theory, the nature and development of Our Universe
can proceed from just a few postulates, which are tied in with a fresh
view on the nature of the force fields and also their relation to some
of the fundamental constants now recognized in physics, primarily the basic
Planck related constant. That these could lead to a plausible explanation
of the nature and development of Our Universe will be the prime effort
of this essay.
<p><b>Birth Of Our Universe:</b>
<p>A major premise in Rhysmonic Cosmology is that the original primordial
Universe consisted of but a pure rhysmonic matric structure, which we can
call the rhysmoid. This rhysmoid contained an extremely large number of
rhysmons, the fundamental particle of this Universe. This number probably
exceeded 10<sup>200</sup> rhysmons, and the energy constant of the total
rhysmons probably was also in the order of 10<sup>200</sup> ergs (See Reference
1 for more details). How this primordial Universe came into existence is
a matter of conjecture. It may have resulted from the long term collection
of ‘free’ rhysmons from extremely deep space, or it may have been the result
of some Prime Cause. Rhysmonics must accept the existence of such a basic
rhysmoid structure as the starting point for this cosmology.
<p>Shown in <b><a href="#1a">Figure (1a)</a></b> is the primordial Universe
(Stage I) in planar form, although it must be recognized that the actual
rhysmoid is spherical in form. A second major premise in rhysmonics is
that the matrix structure of the Rhysmoid is describable in Cartesian Coordinates
and thus in conventional plane and spherical geometries. The rhysmoid at
this time could be described as pure, that is, free from any density variations
which could be described as ‘particles of matter’ in that structure. However,
due to the nature of this matrix structure, a ‘focal shell’ region which
is located at about the half-radius point in this spherical structure,
will exist. This is due to the long range ‘instantaneous’ vectors in the
energy field of the rhysmoid as described in Reference 1. These vectors
are really the source of the so-called gravitational fields. Thus, gravity
fields are basic to the very nature of this Universe.
<p>Shown in <b><a href="#1b">Figure (1b)</a></b> is Stage II in the development
of this Rhysmonic Universe. Here, due to certain internal instabilities,
or some ‘outside’ influences, density fluctuations in the rhysmoid may
exist, and these may result in the formation of ‘stabilized’ density variations
which can now be called particles or mass. These form primarily due to
various ‘field’ effects in the rhysmoid geometry, and collect mainly near
the focal shell region of the rhysmoid. Further, shielding effects between
these particles result in ‘impelling’ mechanisms between the particles,
the so-called gravitational attractions, and thus a movement of the particles
toward each other as well as toward the central regions of the rhysmoid.
Unequal particle densities will result in a circular movement, or ‘curl’,
in the particle concentrations. This curl is thus the very beginnings of
spiral formations in these concentrations.
<p>Shown in <b><a href="#1c">Figure (1c)</a></b>, Stage III, is the next
generalized stage in the formation of Our Universe. Here, the continued
generation of particles and the resulting migration toward the central
regions, as a function of the universal gravity field, causes a buildup
of matter in the central regions. A ‘material’ universe now exists and
with a definite spiral structure due to the initial unequal density conditions.
However, while matter now tends to concentrate in the central regions,
the outer regions of the Universe tends to remain a pure rhysmoid region.
<p>Shown in <b><a href="#1d">Figure (1d)</a></b> is Stage IV in the development
of this Universe. While the universe retains its ‘birth’ structure, i.e.,
the spiral form, it now has a very dense central core, as well as some
lesser cores dispersed here and there. Some of these outer cores have also
developed their own spiral structures, i.e., galaxies, and thus the Universe
is now a system of galactic structures superimposed upon a master galactic
structure, with regions of space in between which are rather devoid of
mass or other structures, and thus may be the so-called holes in space.
<p>Shown in <b><a href="#1e">Figure (1e)</a></b> is Stage V, probably the
present day stage, where a now well-defined system of galactic structures
exists. The central core mass has since gone ‘supernova’ (probably several
times) and now contains an extremely massive ‘black hole’, or holes, as
well as a well-defined shock-formed ring of concentrated mass, both debris
and galaxies. Shown here also (dotted) is the probable limit of the ‘visible’
universe, due to the nature of the propagation of electromagnetic wave
signals (Ref. 5). While some matter could also have migrated into the pure
rhysmoid region, that region probably remains a pure rhysmoid region. Thus,
Our Universe should now show some traces of a super spiral galactic structure,
as well as regions devoid of concentrations of mass. It will be sown that
gravitational signal astronomy, as was developed by the author, appears
to indicate that such structures actually exist. There is also reason to
believe that the detection of quasar-type events in the Universe lends
credence to the fact that pure rhysmoid regions also exist (Ref. 5). Other
verifiable structures in Our Universe will also be noted here. Therefore,
there is both theoretical and experimental evidence for the existence of
such a postulated Universe. These will now be further considered.
<p><b>The Active Universe:</b>
<p>Our Universe today appears to be in a relatively stable equilibrium
state, i.e., in a ‘steady-state’ condition. This appears to be confirmed
in the many electromagnetic wave observations of Our Universe, out to the
so-called ‘visible’ universe limit. These are the observations being made
at visible light frequencies, as well as ultra-violet, infrared, millimeter
and radio frequencies. Unfortunately, due to the limitations in the propagation
mode for EM waves, we cannot obtain information on the nature of Our Universe
beyond that visible light with our present observational techniques. However,
EM wave techniques have, nevertheless, provided us with much knowledge
about the nature of Our Universe. Due to the finite times for transmissions
of EM waves, these methods can provide us with a ‘picture’ of Our Universe
as it existed ‘back in time’. Surprisingly, most data indicated that Our
Universe, even back to this limit in time, has been very similar to the
conditions seen in more recent times, implying tat Our Universe has been
in a steady-state condition for at least this period in time. These observations
have indicated a very active and dynamic Universe, made up of stars, gas,
dust and molecules, galaxies, and galactic systems, to name a few. Some
of the observations will be noted here:
<p><i>Stars</i>: Stars are the most prevalent EM wave-observable objects
in the Universe. These are luminous hot balls of gas, in general. While
some stars are ‘loners’, most are members of vast clusters or galaxy systems.
Stars may be ‘born’ primarily in contracting gas and dusty clouds, and
‘live’ long lives, but eventually die, like many humans, either rather
peacefully, or also quite violently. The more violent deaths are in terms
of nova or supernova type events. These are, at times, quite dramatically
observed with EM wave methods.
<p><i>Galaxies</i>: Vast collections of stars, such as clusters or galaxies,
also appear to have long lives and a very definite development history.
Many are believed to have ‘monster energy sources’ in their nucleus (cores).
Some of these have since come to be termed ‘black holes’, since their extreme
mass, and thus very strong gravity, does not allow EM wave radiation to
leave; thus the name.
<p>While the history of astronomy and astrophysics is replete with observations
of an EM wave nature, confirming that Our Universe is very active, indeed,
the author has also developed a gravitational signal method of observing
Our Universe, which not only confirms much of the EM wave observations,
but also has opened a ‘new window’ to the Universe. This has disclose other
unsuspected aspects in Our Universe which will also be considered here.
<p><b>Universe Observation methods:</b>
<p>EM waves, as has already been noted, are the prevalent methods for observing
Our Universe. Electromagnetic waves are a propagating disturbance in the
Rhysmoid, i.e., the vacuum, which proceeds at the speed of light. This
disturbance is recognized as crossed electric and magnetic fields, with
the direction of propagation normal to these crossed fields. Thus, it is
considered to be a ‘transverse’ wave type of propagation.
<p>Gravitational signals, however, are fundamental to the very fabric of
the Universe; it exists because the Universe exists and thus it cannot
be divorced from it. The signals are basically monopolar and proceed essentially
radially (and longitudinally) from the source of the ‘disturbance’ in essentially
instantaneous fashion. Therefore, these signals, while basically due to
the same rhysmonic sub-structure, are actually quite different in nature
and have not been utilized previously. EM waves, moreover, may be created
or destroyed (i.e., dissipated). The electric and magnetic components interact
strongly with matter, and thus their propagation can be quite lossy in
a material medium. Gravitation, however, interacts with mass on a much
smaller scale, and thus generally requires large masses (or mass effects)
to become a significant factor in the Universe. Most normal materials are
therefore quite transparent, in terms of gravity. Thus gravitational effects
are usually associated with very dense or massive bodies, but their effects
may also be noted at much less massive levels under the proper methods.
For example, each person notes the effects of the earth’s gravity field
on his own body mass as his weight or ‘heaviness’. However, there is an
interaction between gravitational and electromagnetic fields, which is
at low levels, but can be made useful with proper techniques.
<p>Devices known as gravity meters (or gravimeters) can provide much information
about Our Universe in terms of the many gravitational signals emitted by
or introduced by massive gravity events in the Universe Moreover, due to
the essentially instantaneous response times for these signals, the observations
in terms of gravity signals are now, i.e., in real time, and thus indicative
of the our Universe in the present and not the remote past as is the case
with most EM wave observational methods.
<p>The author refers the reader to his many pertinent articles as listed
in the References, and will thus describe only a few special experimental
gravity observations here, primarily to indicate to the reader the power
of these methods.
<p><b>Experimental Confirmations:</b>
<p>Much EM wave observational data is available on aspects o the ‘visible’
universe now, but most of it is as the Universe ‘was’, back in time, due
to the relatively ‘slow’ propagation time for electromagnetic effects.
However, since the Universe is believed to have been in a ‘steady-state’
condition in that time period, these observations also provide much data
on the present state of Our Universe. While visible light observations
have been used primarily in the past, observations today at other frequencies,
such as the radio frequencies, e.g., radio astronomy, provide much additional
information which may not be available at the light frequencies. For example,
some radio astronomy data is very striking and supports much of the optical
data. In a similar manner, gravitational signal data can also be quite
striking and also supports much of the EM wave type data. However, due
to its very nature and ‘instant’ time of response, the gravitational signals
can disclose much new aspects which cannot really be determined by the
electromagnetic wave observational method. Thus this ‘new window’ to Our
Universe is a very valuable supplement to astronomy and astrophysical techniques,
and it is unfortunate that the professionals are not presently making use
of these techniques. The author is presently endeavoring to get more open-minded
experimenters and amateur scientists to become more involved here, especially
since the techniques are so simple and very low in cost. The author has
released much information on these techniques and their observations and
the reader is again referred to the References for additional information.
This essay will refer to but some of the larger-scale astronomical structures
noted, primarily to indicate to the reader the power and scope of these
techniques.
<p>The gravitational signal detection methods used in these observations
are with devices which may be called gravity meters (gravimeters). Most
of the presently available gravimeters are of the mechanical type, and
the reader is referred to Reference 4 for some of the author’s experiences
with a simplified version of such a device. Emphasis here, however, will
be with an electronic-type gravimeter as developed by the author. While
there is much more information on this device in the listed references,
the author will briefly describe the basic operation of the device here.
<p>The basic electronic-type gravimeter is shown in <b><a href="#2">Figure
(2)</a></b>. It is based upon readily available operational amplifier integrated
circuit devices and, as can be seen here, it is extremely simple in its
circuitry. Active gravitational flux gradients, e.g., gravity ‘winds’ developed
by supernova events, or passive gravity events, the gravitational ‘shadows’
cast by black holes, for example, affect the electron-ion structure of
the detecting capacitor element, C, and thus create current fluctuations
from that capacitor. These current fluctuations are highly amplified and
converted to voltage fluctuations by the operational amplifier, IC<sub>1</sub>.
The DC output from IC<sub>1</sub>, with some AC fluctuations superimposed,
is further amplified with opamp IC<sub>2</sub>. The output of IC<sub>2</sub>
is passed through a low-pass filter section, the characteristics of which
will determine the response time for the system, and thus the response
time to certain astronomical events. The gravity variations may then be
followed on an output voltmeter, or recorded on other systems, such as
a strip chart recorder or a computer. That such a detector system is viable
is seen in that while ‘transient’ astronomical events are ‘caught’ at arbitrary
times, ‘permanent’ astronomical events are repeatedly seen whenever these
events cross the observer’s meridian position on Earth.
<p>The power of this system will be illustrated by observations of two
very large structures in this Universe. One is the Milky Way Galaxy, our
home Galaxy, which is also observable visually, as well as quite strikingly
in terms of EM wave radiations. The other observation, which was originally
but a conjecture in Rhysmonics, has since been confirmed with both the
mechanical- and electronic-type of gravimeters. This is the apparent Super
Galaxy System of Our Universe, and it appears to have a structure which
closely parallels the structure seen (gravitationally) in our own Milky
Way Galaxy System.
<p>The electronic gravimeter, when the output is heavily filtered is heavily
filtered to suppress the more active short term gravity gravity responses,
discloses the presence of these two systems rather dramatically is basically
a g-field meter and responds mainly to long-term variations in the g-factor,
mostly those due to astronomical events. The ‘modulations’ in the g-factor
seen here are those due to our own galaxy (due to its close proximity)
and that due to the Super Galaxy (due to its over-riding concentration
of mass).
<p>The response shown in <b><a href="#3a">Figure (3a)</a></b> is the overall
response in the g-factor as seen on that date and at the times shown. Short
term responses in this plot were largely eliminated in the slow scan period
used with the D-Arsonval type strip chart recorder used to obtain this
plot. Here, the Super Galaxy response is dominant except where the ‘local’
Milky Way Galaxy also crosses the observer’s meridian position. If the
effects of the Milky Way Galaxy ‘transit’ are removed from this response,
as shown in <b><a href="#3b">Figure (3b)</a></b>, the characteristics of
the Super Galaxy become that much more apparent. These plots appear to
show that like our Sun’s location in an outer spiral section of our Galaxy
(and somewhat of the plane of the galaxy). The nucleus sections are prominent
in each scan, indicating similar concentrated masses and ‘black hole’ cores
in each galaxy scanned. The nucleus mass and black hole is located in Sagittarius
Region of our celestial sphere. It should also be noted that the Super
Galaxy nucleus region was in our zenith region at the time of its scan
and this resulted in a reduction in the g-factor, while the Milky Way nucleus
region was underneath our Earth position and thus this resulted in an increase
in the g-factor as shown.
<p>That massive gravitational effects in Our Universe can have effects
on our weather systems here on Earth appears to have been noted by a major
Milky Way Galaxy Center event on about December 5, 1986, and another major
Super Galaxy Center event on march 14, 1988. These events apparently introduced
‘gravity wind’ effects which affected our normal jet stream patterns. It
is believed that the December 5, 1986 event introduced a new tangential
component to gravity in the Northern Latitudes, and this resulted in the
somewhat colder and stormier winter of 1986-87. However, it is believed
that the event of March 14, 1988 introduced a new more vertical component
to gravity in the Northern latitudes and this may have been responsible
for the long, hot summer seen in the USA in the year 1988.
<p><b>Conclusions:</b>
<p>Monitoring of the g-factor with either the mechanical- or the electronic-type
gravimeters can not only give much new information on the nature and development
of Our Universe, but can also forewarn Earthlings of possible EM wave dangers
from the more ‘local’ gravity events. This is because gravity events are
detected as they occur, but the EM wave components will generally take
a much longer time to reach the Earth, depending on the location of the
originating gravity event. For example, shown in <b><a href="#4a">Figure
(4)</a></b> are some scans of our Galaxy Center regions. In <b><a href="#4a">Figure
(4a)</a></b> is shown a typical EM wave scan o this region while in <b><a href="#4b">Figure
(4b)</a></b> a typical gravity scan made prior to December 5, 1986 is shown.
While the EM wave scan (by radio astronomy) is in terms of radio wave radiations,
the plots show it coincided quite well with the mass concentrations as
shown in the gravity scan made by the author. However, after December 5,
1986, the gravity scan of the form shown in <b><a href="#4b">Figure (4b)</a></b>
disappeared and was replaced by a new deep black hole and ring structure
as shown in <b><a href="#4c">Figure (4c)</a></b>. While that gravity event
occurred about December 5, 1986 (and affected the Earth in gravitational
fashion then and ever since), the EM wave effects will not reach us for
about another 30,000 years. However, we may not be so lucky with a more
‘local’ gravity event. For example, it is also suspected that perhaps the
star Betelgeuse in Orion may also have gone supernova as a result of the
Galaxy Center event of about December 5, 1986, but the EM waves from that
event (if real) will reach us in about 300 years rather than the 30,000
years for the Center event. In addition to its radiation effects, which
will be much more intense, it will also be one ‘helluva’ visual Supernova
display! The author is releasing much data and information on these techniques
for the benefit of mankind. However, the author regrets that but very few
are heeding him at present. The author cannot do all these observations
alone, and thus much data and knowledge is being lost.
<p>One final note: The data of <b><a href="#3a">Figure (3a)</a></b> is
plotted over a two-day period in <b><a href="#5">Figure (5)</a></b>. This
plot appears to show the observed cosine variation noted in the measured
microwave background radiation may be related to the highly averaged variation
in the g-factor also. Rhysmonic cosmology predicted that such a variation
in the MBR would be due to our off-center position in this Universe and
that such a variation would exist even if the ‘structure’ due to mass variations
as seen in <b><a href="#5">Figure (5)</a></b> did not exist. Careful measurement
and plots like those shown here could very well detail the actual structure
of Our Universe when used in conjunction with data obtained by other observational
methods. Much can be accomplished here!
