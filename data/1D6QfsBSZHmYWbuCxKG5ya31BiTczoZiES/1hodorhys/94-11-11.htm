      <p><b>I. Speculations on the Gravitational Constant, G</b>
      </p>
      <p>There are many interpretations for the gravitational constant,
        G, the
        value of which is presently determined largely from various
        experimental
        tests. I have shown in some past Notes that this value was also
        determinable
        from dimensional analysis using the Planck Natural units (PNU).
        However,
        it intrigued me to know just what this constant really stood
        for. I knew
        that it was related to the ‘force’ of gravity of gravity in
        terms of Rhysmology,
        but past attempts to evaluate it always resulted in some extra
        terms in
        mass, length, or time. In some analyses these extra terms showed
        up as
        an acceleration, cm/sec<sup>2</sup>, or as a surface density,
        gm/cm<sup>2</sup>.
        I finally realized that both these relations could be directly
        obtained
        from the dimensional analysis of the units of the value of G!
        For example:
      </p>
      <p>G = L3 / MT<sup>2</sup> = cm3 / gm sec<sup>2</sup> = cm/sec<sup>2</sup>
        x cm<sup>2</sup>/gm = cm/sec<sup>2</sup> / gm/cm<sup>2</sup>
      </p>
      <p>Where the resultant cm/sec<sup>2</sup> is acceleration, a;
        gm/cm<sup>2</sup>
        is surface density, S.
      </p>
      <p>In terms of Rhysmonic Cosmology, this could be considered as
        follows
        (Figure 1):
      </p>
      <p>a* = L* / T*<sup>2</sup> <u>~</u> 1.616 x 10<sup>-22</sup> /
        29.06 x
        10<sup>-88</sup> <u>~</u> 5.56 x 10<sup>53</sup> cm/sec<sup>2</sup>.
      </p>
      <p>S* = m* / L*<sup>2</sup> <u>~</u> 2.177 x 10<sup>-5</sup> /
        2.611 x
        10<sup>-66</sup> <u>~</u> 8.34 x 10 <sup>60</sup> gm/cm<sup>2</sup>.
      </p>
      <p>Therefore G <u>~</u> a* / s* <u>~</u> 6.67 x 10-8 cm<sup>3</sup>/gm
        sec<sup>2</sup>, this being the same value obtained in
        experiment and this
        rhysmonic determination! Therefore, G may be a measure of the
        acceleration
        of rhysmonic flux through a unit area, something like the
        Poynting Vector
        in EM work. However, this measure may also be expressed as a
        surface force
        or a pressure gradient as follows:
      </p>
      <p>P* = S*a* <u>~</u> 4.64 x 10<sup>114</sup> dynes/cm<sup>2</sup>.
      </p>
      <p><b>II. Some Comments on This Interpretation of G</b>
      </p>
      <p>1. Rhysmonics implies that there is a very dynamic but highly
        localized
        structure in the rhysmoid (aether) which exists in the order of
        Planck
        Length dimensions in the 4 th dimension. Thus, when I speak
        about rhysmonic
        ‘flux flow’, I do not imply a movement of rhysmons over any
        extended lengths,
        which we do in the third dimension where flux flow usually means
        an actual
        movement of particles, both microcosmic and macrocosmic. Both
        result in
        a pressure per unit area, but in rhysmonics only the effect is
        transported
        over space, very much like sound waves or water waves are
        transported and
        where there is little relative movement of the air or water
        molecules.
        Another difference here is that the rhysmonic effects are
        ‘transported’
        essentially in an instantaneous fashion as pointed out in my
        Cosmology.
      </p>
      <p>2. The universal gravitational ‘flux’ energy vectors are
        omni-directional
        in free ‘undisturbed’ space but due to the rhysmonic structure
        of space
        these vectors cancel and thus no 3rd dimensional effects are
        seen. Moreover,
        these energetic basic 4th dimensional vectors cannot be ‘tapped’
        directly
        with most present day technology techniques. However, it is
        possible to
        ‘tap’ the energy in certain other existing scalar gradients in
        this field
        (or those which can be created with the use of certain field
        modifying
        techniques). The main gradients are well-known: E-fields,
        H-fields, EM-fields,
        and g-fields. There may be many other field gradients which
        contain much
        energy, but most of these are as yet ‘unknown’ and must be
        ‘discovered’
        before man can use them as an energy source. There are already
        hints of
        these in some ‘free energy’ experiments and energy ‘machines’.
      </p>
      <p>3. Much of the potential energy of the universal gravitational
        field
        has been ‘captured’ in particles and various radiation fields,
        and these
        provide much of our present day useful energy using the
        technology of today.
        However, as we learn more about our rhysmoid (aether) we should
        eventually
        be able to utilize this very basic energy through direct means
        and highly
        efficiently (more than 100%). That day is now approaching.
      </p>
      <p><b>III. Conclusions</b>
      </p>
      <p>Rhysmonic cosmology is continuing to develop into a simple but
        sound
        approach to cosmology and this increasing expectations in both
        the theoretical
        and technological fallout. Within my very limited time here, I
        will continue
        to report to you on any further thoughts or discoveries. I will
        not be
        able to do much in terms of experiments in the near future and
        it would
        be nice to have a little more help (a la Bill Ramsay) in these
        lines, as
        well as more comments on the theory. I wish all the best regards
        and good
        experimenting.
