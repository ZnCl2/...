      <p><b>A. Background ~</b>
      </p>
      <p>Rhysmonic Cosmology is based largely on the promise that
        Planck’s Natural
        Units (PNU) determine the measure of our Universe. Planck
        originally chose
        the fundamental constants of G, C, and h in his determination of
        the Natural
        Units. Notes that all these constants involve mass, length, and
        time (MLT),
        which are the measurement units of mechanics! Planck chose
        natural units
        which made each of these constants equal to unity. However,
        since Planck’s
        original work, it was determined that Planck’s Reduced Constant,
        h / 2
        pi, or <strike>h</strike>, rather than h was more in agreement
        was more
        in agreement with many experimental relations. Rhysmonics
        concurs with
        that since h defines the unit directed-energy vector in
        rhysmonic structure!
        Using the CGS measurement system (as Planck did) we now have the
        Natural
        Units:
      </p>
      <p>L* = ( <strike>h</strike> G / C<sup>3</sup> ) 1/2 ~ 1.616 x 10<sup>-33</sup>
        cm.
      </p>
      <p>T* = ( <strike>h</strike> G / C<sup>5</sup> ) 1/2 <u>~</u>
        5.391 x 10<sup>-44</sup>
        sec.
      </p>
      <p>M* = ( <strike>h</strike> C / G ) 1/2 <u>~</u> 2.177 x 10<sup>-5</sup>
        gm.
      </p>
      <p><b>B. Speculations ~</b>
      </p>
      <p>Using M*L*T* implies a mechanical Universe since M* (mass)
        would involve
        a particle, L*, a spatial dimension, and T*, a temporal
        dimension, i.e.,
        matter and motion! Rhysmonic Cosmology has developed these
        concepts into
        a logical description of our Universe and also the many
        relations involving
        in describing it. However, when some of these units were used
        with estimates
        made of the physical size of the rhysmon, mind-boggling results
        were seen!
        For example, an early estimate of the radius of a spherical
        rhysmon was
        about 1.62 x 10<sup>-66</sup> cm. Therefore, the volume (V*) of
        this particular
        rhysmon would be about:
      </p>
      <p>Density = M* / V* <u>~</u> 2.188 x 10<sup>-5</sup> gm / 1.78 x
        10<sup>-197</sup>
        cm<sup>3</sup> <u>~</u> 1.22 x 10<sup>192</sup> gm/cm<sup>3</sup>
        !!
      </p>
      <p><b>C. Concluding Remarks ~</b>
      </p>
      <p>1. A density value of 1.22 x 10<sup>192</sup> gm/cm<sup>3</sup>
        would
        place the rhysmon into the category of a sub-mini black hole!
      </p>
      <p>2. However, such a black hole must be made up of some sort of a
        sub-mini
        structure which is located were we now call a void!
      </p>
      <p>3. If sub-mini black holes are the fundamental mass particles
        (rhysmons)
        of our Universe, then is our Universe but a super Black Hole in
        a super-maxi
        ‘other’ Universe? Where would such constructions end??
        Mind-boggling indeed!!
