      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Introduction:</font></b>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Simplest gravimeter Circuit
          #910
          was fabricated in a 1.5" x 2.5" x 5" plastic box with an
          aluminum cover
          plate. All operating controls were brought out on this panel,
          including
          an output jack and a 2.25" wide meter to display the output
          voltage. A
          single 9-volt battery supply is contained within the unit.
          While this unit
          was primarily designed as an earth g-field gravimeter unit, it
          will also
          display the QND type gravity impulses and l/f noise on an
          external oscilloscope
          and/or audio amplifier unit.</font>
      </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The Circuit:</font></b>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The circuit is a standard GW
          detector
          unit designed around the readily available 741 operational
          amplifier (op-amp)
          device. This unit is more fully described in the article
          "Gravimeters:
          A New Window to the Universe?" Circuit parameters and controls
          were adjusted
          for this particular application to provide for both the
          gravimeter and
          GW signal modes of operation with very simple circuitry. This
          circuitry
          is shown in <b><a href="#9s">Figure (1)</a></b>.</font>
      </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Operation:</font></b>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Operation of this unit is
          very simple:
          For the gravimeter mode --- place the sensitivity and set
          controls to their
          mid-positions and then turn on the power supply. Initial
          turn-on will result
          in the over-ranging of the meter output, but the output will
          quickly settle
          down to about mid-range when the power supply capacitor fully
          charges.
          The sensitivity control may now be used to adjust the output
          to say, 32,
          on the meter scale to conform to a nominal g-field
          acceleration of 32 ft/sec<sup>2</sup>
          . However, this unit will display an increase in the g-field
          as a down-scale
          reading (and vice versa)! However, it will be an accurate and
          sensitive
          gravimeter: e.g., bending one’s body over the unit (to shield
          some of the
          earth’s g-field) will result in a 0.5 to 0.8% reduction in the
          g-factor
          seen!</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">For use as a QND type
          gravity signal
          detector, just connect the output to an oscilloscope and/or
          audio amplifier
          unit. Displayed now in ‘sight and sound’ will be the many
          supernovae ‘bursts’
          as well as the general l/f background noise. Due to the low
          levels of output
          from this unit (no gain stage used), the oscilloscope or audio
          amplifier
          used should have sufficient gain to properly display these
          effects.</font>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">(1) Unit may be 'calibrated'
          with
          a judicious selection of sensitivity and set controls.
          Reasonable 'close'
          calibration is achieved with set control at mid-range, and
          sensitivity
          control set for 32 (i.e., 32 ft/sec<sup>2</sup>).</font>

      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Conclusions:</font></b>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Gravimeter unit Circuit #910
          is a
          good introduction to both the dynamic GW detection of rapid
          ‘violent’ events
          in the universe, and also to observe the long-term highly
          averaged effects
          of these events on the earth’s gravity, i.e., the g-factor.
          The author
          believes that unusual variations in the earth’s g-factor in
          recent years
          has resulted in the ‘strange’ weather patterns seen in this
          time period.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">This circuit’s simplicity,
          low cost,
          and good performance makes it an ideal unit for the newcomer
          to the study
          of gravitation in terms of rhysmonic cosmology theory. Good
          experimenting
          to all!</font>
