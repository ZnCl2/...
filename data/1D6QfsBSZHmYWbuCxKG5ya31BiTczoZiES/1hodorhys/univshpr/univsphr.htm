      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Introduction ~</font></b>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Currently popular
          cosmological models
          for the universe are the Big Bang theory, the Oscillating
          theory, and the
          Steady-State theory. In the Big Bang version, the universe is
          supposed
          to have begun as a ‘primeval’ atom which contained all of the
          mass of the
          universe and exploded about 15 billion years or so ago,
          resulting in the
          apparent expansion seen today. In the Oscillating version, the
          universe
          does not expand forever,, but because of serlf-gravitation,
          stops, and
          then collapses to the ‘primeval’ atom state again to repeat
          the cycle.
          In the Steady-State version, constant mass and mean density is
          postulated.
          Since this theory also calls for expansion, continuous
          creation of matter
          is needed to maintain the mean density constant.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">As noted above, the current
          theories
          all postulate expansion of the universe as evidenced by the
          Hubble relation
          of velocity-distance for the galaxies. In addition, various
          geometries
          are also postulated, for example, Einstein’s 4-dimensional
          space. This
          all results in the necessity for many ad hoc explanations for
          these effects.
          However, rhysmonic cosmology, since it starts with very basic
          assumptions,
          effectively eliminates the need for such ad hoc assumptions
          and becomes
          a general theory for all known and yet unknown effects.</font>
      </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Rhysmonic Postulates ~</font></b>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The universe in terms of
          rhysmonics
          requires but a few postulates which will be listed here:</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">1. The universe is Euclidian
          in geometry.</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">2. Matter particles (mass)
          form only
          in the central portion of the universe.</font><font
          face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">3. The edge of the universe
          is a
          perfect reflector of radiant energy and thus the universe is a
          true black
          body.</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">4. The universe is finite,
          spherical,
          and of constant energy content.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The above postulates will be
          only
          briefly developed in this article but will be more completely
          developed
          as the development of rhysmonic cosmology unfolds.</font>
      </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Geometry of the Universe
            ~</font></b>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">As was shown in <b><a
              href="#fig4">Figure
              (1)</a></b>, the basic cell of the matrix structure of
          rhysmonics is a
          hexagonal system where directed vectors make angles of 0<sup>o</sup>,
          60<sup>o</sup>,
          90<sup>o</sup>, or 120<sup>o</sup> with each other, in the
          plane or in
          the 3-dimensional volume. Since the planar structure builds up
          into a hexagonal
          3-dimensional Euclidian system and this system repeats up to
          its maximum
          (universe) dimensions, the Euclidian geometry of the matrix
          cell also continues
          out to the maximum universe dimension, i.e., the rhysmonic
          geometry remains
          Euclidan, except, perhaps, under highly localized conditions.
          Thus, the
          rhysmonic universe is Euclidan.</font>

      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Matter in the Universe ~</font></b>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It was indicated in <b><a
              href="#fig11">Figure
              (2)</a></b> that matter (mass) particles form only out to
          the half radius
          point in the rhysmoid universe. This is primarily due to two
          factors as
          depicted in <b><a href="#fig6">Figure (3)</a></b>. First, due
          to the rhysmoid’s
          hexagonal geometry, ideal 60<sup>o</sup> reflections from the
          edge of the
          universe will be limited to the outer one-half radius, and
          thus this region
          will tend to remain a pure rhysmoid. Second, any perturbations
          within the
          center half of the rhysmoid sphere will reflect off the
          spherical edge
          of the universe to the focal plane which is also the edge of
          the center
          matter sphere, thus maintaining the outer half radius as pure
          rhysmoid.
          By the same token, perturbations at the focal plane can be
          reflected off
          the universe edge and possibly be statistically combined at
          different points
          in the matter region, creating the excesses and deficiencies
          of rhysmons
          which make up the matter in this region. While this matter in
          the central
          region is created randomly, the matter would probably be
          organized in some
          fashion by gravitational effects which would appear with the
          creation of
          this mass or mater. It is also feasible that possible
          collisions between
          multiple universes (possible in rhysmonic cosmology) may also
          create mater
          in this region by shock action.</font>

      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Reflections at Rhysmoid
            Edge ~</font></b>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Consider the simplified
          planar basic
          cell of <b><a href="#fig4">Figure (1)</a></b> a being at the
          edge of the
          universe. Note the directions of the four rhysmoid vectors
          depicted in
          this figure. At a time T* later, or 5.391 x 10<sup>-44 </sup>seconds
          later,
          the direction of these vectors reverse as the rhysmons in each
          closed loop
          of the complete matrix cell continue around in ‘orbit’. The
          original direction
          is then restored T* (Planck Time) later. There fore, since
          this matrix
          structure is repeated throughout the universe, the universe is
          like a perfect
          ‘machine’ in which reality as we perceive it, has a cinematic
          continuity,
          where each single ‘picture’ in the cinema of existence lasts
          for only 5.391
          x 10<sup>-44</sup> seconds. Rhysmonics, therefore, restores
          Newton’s concepts
          of absolute space and time in the universe.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It will be shown later, that
          these
          rhysmonic vectors, since they reverse in time T*, some
          perturbation effects
          in the universe can be essentially instantaneous effects, and
          form the
          basis of gravitation. Thus gravitation is essentially an
          instantaneous
          effect, or ‘action at a distance’. It will be shown that
          electromagnetic
          propagation effects require a finite velocity, C*, which is
          the velocity
          of light as determined by other means. Therefore, while all
          radiative energy
          will be shown to reflect off the universe edge in the
          reversing vector
          process, only gravity effects are ‘instant’; EM wave effects
          require a
          finite velocity. These concepts are important in explaining
          some of the
          paradoxes in astronomy.</font>
      </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Summary &amp; Conclusions
            ~</font></b>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The size of the universe
          depends
          only on the number of rhysmons and the size of the matrix
          cell. The size
          of the cell has been given by Planck’s absolute units, and the
          energy content
          by Planck’s Constant. Therefore, the rhysmonic universe builds
          p from these
          basics and there is no need for atom-smashing experiments to
          determine
          the basic structure of the universe. The universe is a finite
          system.</font>
