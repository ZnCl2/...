<p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Introduction ~</font></b>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Quasars have been an enigma ever
since they were first discovered in the late 1950s. It is difficult to
explain the enormous energy output, small size, rapid fluctuations in output,
and apparent remoteness within the present concepts of astronomy. However,
rhysmonic cosmology offers a simple and elegant solution to this enigma
and requires no ad hoc explanations. Simply stated, quasars are ordinary
galaxies (more likely Seyfert types) which are viewed under special conditions
in this rhysmoid universe.</font>
<p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Seyfert Galaxies ~</font></b>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Seyfert galaxies are a class of galaxies
which have unusually active nucleuses. They are, therefore, the prime candidate
for quasar type responses. As shown in <b><a href="#fig9">Figure (1)</a></b>,
the nucleus will be prominent in whatever the general class or orientation
of the galaxy. However, many ordinary galaxies, which have black hole energy
engines in the nucleus, should also have quasar type responses at shorter
viewing distances.</font>
<p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Quasar Response ~</font></b>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The nature of quasar response can
be depicted with the rhysmoid model of the universe as shown in <b><a href="#fig10">Figure
(2)</a></b>. The earth’s position in the matte portion of the universe
is shown at point E, while a Seyfert galaxy is shown at point S1. The Seyfert
galaxy can be viewed directly, in a shorter distance E-S1, but viewing
is through the matter universe with its dust clouds and galaxies as well
as interstellar gases and molecules, all of which lead to absorption of
EM wave energy; thus, at best, galaxy S1 is very dimly seen, if at all.
However, galaxy S1 can also be viewed over a much longer path, E-2-S1,
reflected off the edge of the universe at point 2, but with differences.
Absorption bands are present only in the matter regions near earth and
the Seyfert galaxy regions. However, most of the EM wave propagation takes
place in the pure rhysmoid regions, which has no absorption bands, not
even for interstellar hydrogen! However, due to the much longer propagation
path, the spectral lines from galaxy S1 will be highly redshifted (we will
actually be seeing the very short wavelengths being generated in this active
nucleus region) but with little or no absorption of this radiant energy.
Thus, even though the transmission path is very long, the galaxy will look
bright, especially the nucleous region. Since we are observing a small
nucleus region, fluctuations will be present due to the small volume of
the source of this radiation. Rhysmonic cosmology therefore predicts:</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">1) Only apparent high energy output
energy due to very low losses.</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">2) Only apparent large cosmological
distances due to the very long viewing path. The galaxy is much closer
in reality.</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">3) An actual small size since it
is mainly the nucleus part being viewed. Some of the rest of the galaxy
could be viewed if bright enough.</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">4) Emission bands are near S1 while
most absorption bands are near E.</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">5) Absorption due to interstellar
hydrogen will be minimal.</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">6) Redshift values will range over
a range of Z-values which will be determined by the actual path of reflection
off the universe edge and will be determined by the relative location of
earth and the galaxy.</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">7) It should be possible, in principle,
to view our own Galaxy or a nearby Seyfert galaxy using optical path E-1-S2.</font>

<p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Summary &amp; Conclusions ~</font></b>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Rhysmonic cosmology provides a simple
solution to the mystery of quasars, requiring no ad hoc explanations but
only the basic premises as established in the beginning of these cosmological
studies. The predictions flowing from this theory appear to be confirmed
with the many observations of quasars to date.</font>
