      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Gravity meters (also called
          gravimeters)
          are devices used to measure the relative acceleration of the
          force of gravity
          at some particular location. Present day gravimeters are
          mostly but very
          sensitive forms of spring-type scale systems in which changes
          in the weight
          o a fixed mass is measured. Such units are also very sensitive
          to other
          disturbances, e/g/., local vibrations. They are generally
          fabricated with
          complex suspension systems to avoid such problems and thus are
          very expensive.
          Described here, however, is a very simple low-cost electronic
          type gravimeter,
          which while very sensitive, is also relatively free from local
          disturbances
          such as vibrations. Thus it is a rugged portable-type unit
          which can be
          easily constructed by the average electronic experimenter.
          With its high
          sensitivity to ‘local’ variations in the gravity field, it
          could thus be
          used by the amateur prospector in search for oil and mineral
          deposits.
          Moreover, it could be used as an effective device
          (supplementary) by the
          professionals in this area.</font>

      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Introduction:</font></b>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The force of gravity is
          unique in
          that while it is a matter of common everyday experience for
          most people,
          it also remains as quite an enigma with respect to its true
          nature. The
          average person is well aware that the force of the Earth’s
          gravity is reflected
          in the mass of an object, i.e., if one has more body mass, one
          is ‘heavier’,
          and that such ‘heaviness’ can be measured by scale systems.
          However, just
          how such gravity fields interact with mass has been a mystery
          to mankind
          ever since man first realized that all objects ‘fell’.
          Moreover, it remains
          a mystery to most scientists even to this day, although many
          theories have
          been advanced to explain the effect.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">While the true nature of
          gravity
          is as yet unclear, it will be considered as a ‘force field’
          for the purposes
          of this article. The nature of this force field has been
          considered by
          the author in many other presentations, including two papers
          published
          by this very magazine [<i>Radio-Electronics</i>] (Ref. 1,2).
          However, here
          we will be concerned mainly with the earth’s gravitational
          field, how we
          can measure it, and how we can use these measurements in
          specific applications.
          We will do this with devices which may be called gravity
          meters, or gravimeters.</font>

      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Basic Gravimeters:</font></b>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">On earth, the unimpeded
          downward
          motion of a mass in the earth’s gravitational field is called
          the acceleration
          of free fall, or g, and it is in the order of 32 feet per
          second squared
          (or 980 centimeters per second squared). This value of g
          varies slightly
          with the earth latitudes and distances from the earth’s
          center. It is also
          known that g is affected by local mass anomalies such as light
          or heavy
          mineral deposits, or the presence (laterally) of dense rocks,
          such as may
          be found in nearby mountains. The value of g at a particular
          location has
          been most accurately determined from the oscillation period of
          a pendulum.
          However, reasonable accurate determinations may be made wit
          the use of
          sensitive spring-type scales which can determine small changes
          in the ‘weight’
          of a fixed mass.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In the simple spring-type
          scale system,
          the downward acceleration of a mass (as imparted by gravity)
          is impeded
          or retarded by the restoring force presented by the spring as
          shown in
          <b><a href="#h10a">Figure
              (1a)</a></b>. Here, the change in the position of the mass
          is shown by
          a pointer and a calibrated scale. The pointer position is
          generally amplified
          by a lever or system of levers. For an accurate small weight
          variation
          determination the scale system must have a linear response to
          the weight
          variations, i.e., the system must obey Hooke’s Law, that is
          the restoring
          force constant must also be linear. In this case, the
          relationship that
          the weight would be equal to the mass times the accelerating
          factor, i.e.,
          W = mg, holds, since the mass is held constant, any change in
          weight would
          imply a change in g. Rather than the purely mechanical type of
          readout
          for weight variations, an electrical type of readout is
          preferred. The
          author has previously developed a very simple mechanical-type
          of gravimeter
          with an electrical readout as shown in <b><a href="#h10b">Figure
              (1b)</a></b>(Ref.
          3). Here, the restoring force in the scale system was provided
          by a conductive
          foam material in which resistance changes due to weight
          variations were
          read directly by an ohmmeter which could be calibrated in
          terms of weight
          instead of resistance.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Based upon the above
          principles,
          many types of mechanical gravity meters can be designed. Such
          mechanical
          systems are quite sensitive since the earth’s gravity field
          interacts with
          the great many atoms (ions) to be founding the mass of the
          reference weight.
          For example, in the author’s test of the system shown in <b><a
              href="#h10b">Figure
              (1b)</a></b>, the unit responded noticeably to the
          movements of a person
          located directly two floors above the location of this test
          unit. However,
          such devices are also highly susceptible to other disturbances
          such as
          vibrations, air currents, or temperature differentials. For an
          effective
          gravimeter based on mechanical methods, the system must be
          guarded against
          these unwanted effects, or compensated for such effects, and
          thus such
          systems are quite complex and thus expensive. Also
          unrecognized by most
          designers of such systems are the effects of cosmic gravity
          ‘events’ on
          such gravimeters (as described in Refs 1, 2 , and 3). Such
          cosmic effects
          may be circumvented to some extent in gravimeters which
          balance one mass
          against another (the typical old-fashioned balance scale), but
          the vibration,
          air current, and temperature problems would still remain. A
          more practical
          solution to these problems will be given by the
          electronic-type gravimeter
          as developed by the author.</font>

      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Electronic Gravimeter
            Basics:</font></b>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">This electronic gravimeter
          is intended
          specifically for the measurement of the averaged earth
          gravitational field,
          i.e., the acceleration factor, g. It is but a special
          modification of the
          author’s basic gravity detection devices, which are adequately
          described
          in References 1-5, and thus will not be further considered
          here except
          in respect to their use in earth gravity measurements.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The gravity detectors
          respond to
          both a dynamic (AC) gravity component, due to variable
          terrestrial and
          cosmic events, as well as an averaged (DC) gravity component,
          which largely
          reflects the earth’s gravitational field, i.e., the
          acceleration factor,
          g. In order to emphasize this DC component the detector
          sections, IC<sub>1</sub>,
          is made high in sensitivity (but adjustable), and the output
          is further
          amplified in the amplifier section, IC<sub>2</sub>. Moreover,
          in order
          to further emphasize the DC component only, the output is
          heavily filtered
          in order to minimize the AC components as much as feasible. It
          may not
          be possible to remove all AC components in this process, since
          there exists
          in the cosmic radiation some very-large-amplitude but very-low
          frequency
          components. However, the averaged earth gravitational field
          (as detected
          here) can be made sufficiently stabilized so that the unit
          will now respond
          with sufficient sensitivity to the more local gravity field
          ‘modulations’
          due to factors as either the presence of dense man-made masses
          in line
          with the earth’s gravity field, or the presence of hidden mass
          anomalies
          in the earth’s structure which are also in line with the
          earth’s gravity
          field. Thus this unit will serve many of the ordinary purposes
          of a gravimeter
          device. But most important here, the electronic gravimeter
          will be found
          to be insensitive to local vibrations, air currents,
          temperature variations,
          and acoustical or electrical noises, and thus respond only to
          the effects
          of a gravity field itself. Thus it will be useful in many
          areas of scientific
          research and technology. Most of all, it is a simple device
          and very low
          in cost, and thus within the reach and capabilities of
          researchers, scientists,
          and technologists, both the amateur and the professional.</font>

      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Practical Electronic
            Gravimeter:</font></b>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A typical electronic
          gravimeter circuit
          is given in <b><a href="#h10c">Figure (2)</a></b>. Since the
          unit was intended
          for portable use and long battery life, it was constructed
          around a CMOS
          type operational amplifier, the Intersil type ICL7621. That
          device works
          very well with a +/- 1.5 volt battery supply and is also
          fairly insensitive
          to RF fields due to the presence of input diode protection.
          Also the very
          high input resistance for this device enables the use of a
          smaller value
          gravity sensing input capacitor, C<sub>1</sub>, which will
          still keep any
          possible input resonances at 1 Hz or lower.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The sensitivity of the
          detector is
          controlled mainly by the feedback resistance, R<sub>1</sub>.
          While the
          unit normally uses the full gain of 100 times of the amplifier
          stage, IC<sub>2</sub>,
          some gain control, R<sub>2</sub>, is used to calibrate the
          unit or just
          to set the output meter, M, to a particular point on the
          scale.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Three levels of output
          integration
          in the output filter are provided by the selector switch, SW<sub>2</sub>,
          which was made of the shorting type in order to progressively
          sum the capacitors
          in the filter unit. This was done in order to conserve
          capacitor space
          in the portable unit. However, the researcher or experimenter
          may add additional
          capacitance, if desired, by means of the output jack, J<sub>1</sub>.
          This
          jack is normally used to provide an output to an external
          meter device
          or some recording unit, such as a strip chart recorder or a
          computer.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The self-contained
          voltmeter, M,
          is used to visually monitor the averaged gravity field, i.e.,
          the g factor,
          in terms of an output voltage. With the use of the calibration
          control,
          R<sub>2</sub>, the averaged gravity response can be adjusted
          over the range
          of about 500 to 700 millivolts. Therefore, the full range
          scale of this
          meter circuit was made one volt.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The prototype unit was
          constructed
          in a 5 x 3 x 2 inch aluminum box as shown in <b><a
              href="#h10d">Figure
              (3)</a></b>, with its own self-contained battery supply.
          However, the experimenter
          has much leeway in the construction of this unit. None of the
          components
          are critical in value. Another equivalent type CMOS type
          operational amplifier
          could be used as well. A bipolar op-amp could also be used,
          but here, the
          input sensing capacitor, C<sub>1</sub>, would have to be
          increased to at
          least 1000 uF and the battery supply voltage increased to at
          least +/-
          4.5 volts. Some adjustment in the voltmeter range will also be
          required.</font>
      </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Applications:</font></b>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">While the sensitivity
          control, R<sub>1</sub>,
          in the detector stage, IC<sub>1</sub>, is adjustable, it is
          normally used
          full sensitivity, i.e., 5 megaohms, for most applications. The
          calibration
          control, R<sub>2</sub>, is normally set for nominal output of
          600 millivolts
          (or 30 on the author’s 0-50 uA meter scale). It must be
          remembered that
          due to the very long time constant of the output filter, any
          changes made
          with the circuitry controls will take a long time to
          stabilize. So don’t
          try changing control positions in the middle of any
          measurement! The fastest
          time (integration) for the output filter will be in position
          #1 of the
          filter switch, SW<sub>2</sub>. Progressively longer
          integration times will
          be seen in positions #2 and #3.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It may be better to keep the
          filter
          in position #3 for most earth gravitational field experiments.
          Shown in
          <b><a href="#h10e">Figure
              (4)</a> </b>is a typical 24-hour response in the earth’s
          gravity field
          as detected with this unit. It will be noticed that there is a
          12-hour
          variation in the response at times, and most of the variation
          and some
          ‘structure’ may be related to some possible ‘super’ black
          holes located
          in the ‘center’ of our universe (See Ref. 3).</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">For a response to the more
          ‘local’
          gravity anomalies, the filter response may be better set to
          positions #1
          or #2. With the proper adjustment of the gravimeter
          sensitivity, gain and
          filter response, it should be possible to ‘observe’ the
          transit o local
          dense masses which are in line with the detector and the earth
          gravity
          field. These are actually ‘shadows’ of the objects, very much
          like an opaque
          object casting an optical shadow. An application of this which
          came to
          the author’s mind was the possible use of such a detector by a
          submarine
          to locate the presence of a surface vessel directly above it.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A major application of the
          electronic
          gravimeter, of course, is its use in the location of large
          underground
          mass anomalies, which could indicate the possible presence of
          oil or mineral
          deposits. Here, both the amateur and the professional
          prospector may wish
          to try the device in such an application. This is presently
          beyond the
          attempts on the part of the author.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Less well known to most
          scientists,
          either amateur or professional, is the fact that severe
          effects in the
          earth gravity field can affect the earth’s weather. This will
          be because
          changes in the earth gravity components can affect the jet
          stream patterns
          which largely control our weather patterns. The author
          believes that such
          noticeable gravitational disturbances did indeed occur in
          December 1986
          and in March 1988, and these indeed did affect our weather
          patterns. The
          earth has experienced severe weather changes in this time
          period!</font>

          on future earth gravity research. Its simplicity and low cost
          should enable
          both the amateur and professional researchers, as well as
          technologists,
          to enter into this particular aspect of gravity field
          research.</font>
