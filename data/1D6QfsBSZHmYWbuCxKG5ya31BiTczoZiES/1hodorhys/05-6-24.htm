      <p><b>Background</b>
      </p>
      <p>The methods of Rhysmonic Cosmology have resulted in the
        development
        of some gravitational ‘wave’ detectors which have proven to be
        useful in
        a number of applications. Many such uses have been released to
        you over
        the years. A most useful application was in the detection of
        passive and
        active events occurring in the Universe in real time! One such
        detected
        event occurred at our Galaxy Center (along with others there
        since) which
        appear to have affected the Earth’s weather patterns! The strong
        scalar-type
        fields, (i.e., the gravity ‘winds’) may have primarily affected
        out jetstream
        patterns? Another event may be the HAARP experiments going on in
        Alaska
        now, which might also be affecting weather conditions on Earth?
        These two
        events could be as important (or even more so) in causing global
        warming
        on Earth (noticed primarily in the last decade of the 20th
        century) as
        is the release of greenhouse gases into the upper
        atmosphere&nbsp; (which
        is presently considered the prime suspect in the cause of global
        warming).
        Global warming is apparently real and has been verified in a
        number of
        ways, both directly and indirectly, e.g., as in the gradual
        disappearance
        of the Arctic Ocean ice packs! Therefore, it behooves us to look
        at other
        possible causes more closely. Here, further consideration will
        be given
        to the scalar-type fields (i.e., gravity winds), which were
        discovered
        by rhysmonic detection techniques, as possible cause of global
        warming!
      </p>
      <p><b>Galaxy Center Events</b>
      </p>
      <p>While gravitational signal astronomy methods were developed
        long before
        the release of my Monograph, they were emphasized after the
        release of
        my Monograph. Some amateur radio astronomers became interested
        in this
        method and I was developing the observational techniques for our
        Galaxy
        Center (since they were quite repeatable) as a guide for the. It
        was during
        these tests that I observed a most remarkable event there in
        early December
        1986! There was a supernova-type event there on about 12-6-86
        which resulted
        in a new and very deep Black Hole there as well as very strong
        gravity
        winds. I issued a C. Note (12-10-86) to a very few colleagues to
        document
        this discovery and I predicted then that the event would most
        likely affect
        weather conditions (climate) on Earth for many years to come!
      </p>
      <p>I had also kept informing the National Science Foundation
        shortly thereafter,
        but was probably being ignored since I never heard back from
        them! I also
        made a general Press Release on 3-12-87 trying to publicize the
        significance
        of this event but that evidently was also ignored! On 6-4-91, I
        observed
        the event that the new black hole at the Galaxy Center had
        suddenly disappeared
        (actually, I may have caught it in the act!), again causing
        strong gravity
        winds which were possibly affecting the Earth’s weather patterns
        (climate).
        These events also seemed to precede other Earth effect, such as
        increased
        earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes, and other strange weather
        patterns
        world-wide! All these actions were reported to you in paper,
        article and
        C. Notes (6-23-91 and 7-29-91 for example). To summarize
        briefly, I was
        convinced that these events were changing our climate, but I was
        reporting
        them to you mainly! But when I tried to report them to our
        nation (and
        thus the world), it was not heeded! However, the reports now
        speak for
        themselves; the global warming accelerated since about December
        1986!
      </p>
      <p><b>HAARP Testing</b>
      </p>
      <p>Another event which had the potential to alter our weather
        patterns
        were the HAARP tests (which were also started in that same time
        period
        of the last decade of the 20th century?) The use of large-area
        scalar-type
        fields (which the HAARP tests at low frequencies would really
        be) would
        also generate similar gravity wind effects and thus could also
        affect the
        Earth’s weather patterns (primarily by affecting the jet stream
        patters!).
        Moreover, those tests could be weather manipulations?? Whether
        of not HAARP
        was doing this, I could not determine. However, I strongly
        suspect that
        the scalar-type fields arriving here in the general vicinity of
        New York
        City area (now at about 74.2 Kc, a rhysmonic frequency) are
        being focused
        here by the HAARP program, since they are times to the work-week
        hours
        of Alaska! These signals may also be picked up by any AM radio
        (in this
        area) when they are being sent by HAARP. Their purpose here is
        unknown,
        but such testing (?) over a large population group (as in this
        area) might
        have questionable ends? Especially, when such transmittions also
        blot out
        some local radio stations!
      </p>
      <p><b>Conclusions</b>
      </p>
      <p>1. Much more on these topics are covered directly (or
        indirectly) in
        my many releases to you. Some releases may bow be found on the
        Internet.
        I have not been actively monitoring the Universe in recent years
        mainly
        due to the lack of chart paper for my vintage chart recorder),
        and some
        other circumstances of change that have developed here. So I
        really don’t
        know what has been going on into the Universe in recent times.
        Perhaps,
        some other radically new events had occurred, but we will never
        know unless
        monitoring has been continuous! We need many new observers here.
      </p>
      <p>2. While the HAARP tests could certainly affect (control)
        weather patterns
        and thus climate, it may only be a secondary effect compared to
        the role
        played by our Universe itself, especially by our Galaxy Center
        with its
        effect on unstable nearby stars. Perhaps, the star Betelgeuse
        may have
        gone supernova with event of 12-6-86 !
      </p>
      <p>3. The real problem here is that we may have some control over
        the greenhouse
        gases and also the HAARP experiments, but there is no way we
        control massive
        events in the Universe, such as nearby Novae and Supernovae, or
        the massive
        events which were detected at our Galaxy Center.
      </p>
      <p>4. Again, this material has been quickly handwritten and is not
        very
        well organized. It is for your interest and possible concerns.
        In any event,
        global warming (at this time) is for real!! Thus, the Earth
        residents must
        also be concerned. We tried here to offer some alternate
        explanations for
        the cause and you consideration.
