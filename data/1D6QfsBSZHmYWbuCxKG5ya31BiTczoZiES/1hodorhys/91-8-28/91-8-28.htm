      <p style="margin-right:.5in;margin-left:.5in">Bill Ramsay, an avid
        GW signal
        experimenter recently ran some unfiltered GW signal scans using
        his copy
        of my Circuit #175, but with a 27 ohm resister in series with
        each leg
        of the 2200 uF input detector capacitance. This enables higher
        system gains
        and sensitivity with stability when using many vintage ICs. His
        recorder
        unit is a Rustrak unit having a 10 uA movement at 5k ohms and
        has a 2-second
        sampling rate. The chart speed was one inch per hour. This
        should normally
        only show a random noise type scatter plot. However, Bill noted
        much "embedded
        structure" in these scatter plots, which appeared to him to be
        either cosmic
        signals, possibly intelligence, or...??

      <p style="margin-right:.5in;margin-left:.5in">Looking at his many
        scans
        and his recording method, I am of the opinion (at this time)
        that perhaps
        Bill has inadvertently obtained two-dimensional plots of GW
        "shadow" responses.
        This has been proposed as possible by the writer in some papers
        and communications
        in the past. The Rustrak unit, without filtering and at a slow
        scan speed
        would respond to many "dynamic" GW signals in the universe as a
        sort of
        "sweep frequency" such as is used in scopes or the TV. Under the
        2-second
        sampling rate of the Rustrak, the response would be a scatter
        plot of the
        signals, but should not show structure. A continuous pen
        recorder would
        show only a filled in chart response. However, the presence of
        GW shadows
        could not change the scan rates, i.e., show an increase or
        decrease in
        meter movement (voltage) and thus should leave gaps or holes in
        the scatter
        plot which would be related to the density of the shadow masses
        which were
        being scanned. Thus we may have a sort of "picture" of these
        dense masses
        as seen from the observer's position. The dynamic GW signals are
        providing
        the sweep frequency for these scans. Some of the "embedded
        structures"
        are shown marked by the writer on an enclosed scan obtained by
        Bill. Much
        other structure can be seen -- many apparent galaxies or even
        black holes?
      </p>
      <p style="margin-right:.5in;margin-left:.5in">These crude early
        scans seem
        to show a potential for a new type of response for these
        detectors. The
        method can be further developed with other sweep methods and
        sampling methods.
        Bill has apparently showed possible feasibility here --- it is
        up to you
        researchers to help further these techniques.

        to all!
