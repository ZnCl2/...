      <center><b><font size="+1">Rhysmonic ‘Structure’ Revisited</font></b>
        <p><b>(11-5-01)</b></p>
      </center>
      <p><b>A. Background</b>
      </p>
      <p>As you may now know my Rhysmonic Cosmology actually got started
        when
        I first became aware of Planck’s Natural units in 1959. I had a
        strong
        intuitive feeling at that time that those Natural units were
        really describing
        the basic structure of our Universe. This was supported by a
        conviction
        that Euclidian geometry would be the basis of that structure and
        also that
        the fundamental forces of nature would be only two-fold: linear
        momentum,
        i.,e., straight-line inertial forces, and angular momentum,
        i.e., circulatory
        inertial forces. The problem here was how to relate these two
        forces in
        a construction that would also be compatible with Planck’s
        Natural Units.
        Initially, I chose the closest packing of spheres as my guide.
        While I
        would not be looking at solid spheres in this case, I would be
        looking
        at spheres of influence which possibly could involve both linear
        motions
        and rotary motions. Therefore, to start, I placed six spheres in
        contact
        with a central sphere in a simple planar view. See Figure 1a.
        This resulted
        in the six spheres (or circles) developing common tangent points
        with each
        other and the central sphere (or circle). Note that the tangents
        at these
        points formed a hexagonal structure! This intrigued me since
        such a structure
        could repeat out to infinity. Again, by placing my postulated
        small basic
        particle at the tangent points, I would now have an
        instantaneous force-field
        diagram. This diagram is equivalent to a circumscribed hexagram
        in terms
        of Cartesian (Euclidian) geometry. Now, considering each circle
        to be the
        orbit of a rhysmon, expansion of this structure into an extended
        plane
        showed a possibility of two basic forces, linear and rotary, to
        co-exist
        in a repeating structure, provided the rhysmons intermeshed in
        the proper
        sequence! This has been depicted in my Cosmology booklet and in
        various
        papers and Notes. Refer to them for more details.
      </p>
      <p>Further studies extended this structure to three dimensions
        (Cartesian)
        which could also build up to infinite volumes. This structure
        (or construct)
        was able to define Planck’s Constant (h) and also his reduced
        constant
        (?) in terms of an action, which is energy expressed as a
        function of time,
        <i>i.e.</i>,
        energy times time. This energy (a quantum?) could now be
        expressed in terms
        of energy vectors, using the sides of the hexagon in the
        depiction. Remember,
        Figure 1a is an instantaneous view of the planar structure which
        is stopped
        in time! For every other instant in time, the various vectors
        could be
        directed in all possible directions in space (as controlled by
        the circulatory
        orbits of separate rhysmons). These short energy vectors could
        line up
        head-to-tail and thus create a much larger universe-wide energy
        vector
        limited only by Planck Time which would here remain constant).
        The constant
        could provide for rotary vectors in similar fashion. In the
        three-dimensional
        construction all possible directions in space are also possible,
        but these
        would be some coherent effects as shown in my works. You are
        referred to
        them for more details.
      </p>
      <p>However, here I would like to mention a bit more on important
        characteristics
        of such a rhysmon matrix structure. That will be that the
        structure is
        vibratory (or oscillating) in that each universe-wide line
        energy vector
        reverses direction with Planck Time. That will be that the
        structure is
        vibratory (or oscillating) in that each universe-wide line
        energy vector
        reverses direction with Planck Time. This would be a function of
        the circulatory
        direction of each separate rhysmon. Thus, the universe-wide
        vectors would
        change direction as alternate circulating rhysmons come into
        play with
        each Planck Time segment. Therefore, a universal frequency, f*,
        is involved
        here which is of extreme importance in Rhysmonic Cosmology. See
        my <i>Note</i>
        of 10/20/01. This vibratory action is somewhat reminiscent of
        Whittaker’s
        bi-waves?? The individual head-to-tail linear vectors are also
        somewhat
        reminiscent of super-string theory?? More room for research
        here!
      </p>
      <p>However, the construction of Figure 1a appeared tome to be too
        messy
        to depict clearly on paper. Therefore, I took the liberty of
        using the
        construction as shown in Figure 1b. This construct is equivalent
        to Figure
        1a, but it is now more obvious to the human eye and thus
        clearer. Therefore,
        you will find the construct of Figure 1b in most of my works.
        Again, there
        is much more to the rhysmonic construction of the rhysmoid (or
        aether,
        if you wish) than can be given in a brief Note; but much of that
        has been
        covered in my many past releases to you.
      </p>
      <p>However, in this particular Note I wish to apply this
        construction to
        some other effects which may further validate the reality of
        this cosmology
        and thus become a guide for further development by others to the
        advantage
        and its usefulness to mankind.
      </p>
      <p><b>B. Some Applicable Observations</b>
      </p>
      <p>The rhysmonic construction of the Universe results in a
        relatively fixed
        or stationary aether. Thus, reference can be made with respect
        to this
        aether, e.g., linear or rotary effects may be referenced to this
        stationary
        aether. The energy vectors considered here will be related to
        G-fields
        as discussed in C. Note of 10/10/01. However, here on the earth’
        surface,
        another directed energy vector (related to the G-field will be
        seen as
        the earth’s G-field. This G-field is actually the universal
        G-field as
        modified by the shielding action of earth’s mass. It results in
        a flux,
        the acceleration of gravity of about 32 ft/sec<sup>2</sup>,
        which is directed
        toward the earth’s center. Thus, many observed gravitational
        phenomena
        relate to one or the other (or both) of these aspects of the
        universal
        G-field. Some applied aspects are now considered:
      </p>
      <p><b>1. Changes in a G-field</b>
      </p>
      <p>In a previous paper I described an experiment where charges
        were placed
        on a simple balance formed of soda straws. When a negative
        charge was placed
        on the end of a plastic soda straw, it was immediately depressed
        down by
        some force! When a positive charge was placed on the end of a
        paper straw
        it rose up, i.e., it levitated! I looked at this as an
        interaction with
        the earth’s G-field as shown in Figure 2. These effects might
        mainly be
        seen only near the earth’s surface where a ground plane may
        occur. Here,
        however, instead of a balance, I show the effects with a charged
        pith-ball.
        The method of images is used to illustrate this effect. In (a)
        the pith
        ball has a negative charge and its image charge (which is
        positive) results
        in an E-field type rhysmonic flux which opposes the G-field flux
        and thus
        the pith-ball is forced down. In (b) the pith ball has a
        positive charge
        and its image is negative. That results in a rhysmonic flux
        which is ‘attracted’
        by the G-field. This last test is somewhat more difficult to
        observe since
        the charge and image are more separated and also due to the
        difficulty
        of placing a sufficient positive charge on an insulator. Now
        such effects
        might also be related to the earth’s strong natural electric
        field vector,
        which would be similarly directed as the earth’s G-field.
        However, I tried
        to eliminate that effect by running tests deep in a basement
        area where
        there might not be an earth E-field present? However, the test
        results
        were the same so the effects were most likely gravitational?
      </p>
      <p>Now if all this is real, of what use can these effects be? From
        a purely
        speculative view, it might lead to:
      </p>
      <p>(a) A method of developing an anti-gravity effect, e.g., a
        highly negatively
        charged sphere (UFO?) might rapidly rise (levitate) above the
        earth’s surface
        using the earth’s strong electric field vector gradient?
      </p>
      <p>A proper charge level might lead to a hovering effect. Reduced
        charge
        levels could cause it to land. Science fiction here? No, all the
        above
        effects are confirmed at miniature levels in Millikan’s oil-drop
        experiment!
      </p>
      <p>(b) A combination of high negative charge and charge rotation
        might
        also lead to other anti-gravity effects. For example, I ran an
        experiment
        where I charged the rim of a spinning plastic disc negatively.
        While I
        had essentially a static charge here (in the sense that my test
        was fixed
        in relative space) it was also a circulatory flow of electrons
        and thus
        a circular current. This current would develop a strong magnetic
        field
        (whose direction would depend on the direction of rotation). The
        axis of
        the spinning disc was in a vertical direction. The test appeared
        to show
        a much strong depressive force than the lifting force when the
        magnetic
        flux filed was in the same direction as the electric image
        field! Just
        coincidence, or confirmation of rhysmonic field effects? More
        work needed
        here!
      </p>
      <p><b>2. Simple Pendulum Observations</b>
      </p>
      <p>In a previous section the interactions seen with the
        soda-straw-type
        balance primarily involved the earth g-fields. Thus, only
        vertical displacements
        were considered, the horizontal displacements were considered
        negligible.
        However, in the case of the simple pendulum both vertical (Delta
        Y) and
        horizontal (Delta X) displacement have to be considered. The
        simple pendulum
        consists of a weight (mass) suspended from a fixed point by a
        light string
        or other light weight material of length, l, as shown in Figure
        3. The
        mass is pulled to one side and thus us given potential energy by
        the free
        will of the person doing the pulling (i.e., by an external
        force). The
        mass (bob) is released and it moves in an arc along the path
        ABC, where
        the potential energy at A is converted to maximum kinetic energy
        at B,
        and then back to potential energy at C. The process then repeats
        in the
        reverse direction. Using conservation of energy principles this
        will lead
        to simple harmonic motion equations (which can be even further
        more simplified
        by keeping the arc swing angle very small). Thus we arrive at
        the relation:
      </p>
      <p>T (period) = 2 pi ( l / g )<sup>½&nbsp;</sup> or 1 / 2 pi ( g
        / l )<sup>½</sup>
      </p>
      <p>These are the normally used equations for the simple pendulum.
        Note
        that T and f are independent of the mass of the bob, but
        determined only
        by the values of l and g. However, in rhysmonics we have learned
        that,
        g, the earth’s gravitational ‘constant’, can vary, not only due
        to location
        but also due to certain cosmic effects! Lesser known is that the
        kinetic
        energy can also vary due to local effects and also to other
        cosmic effects!
        I will now consider some noted ones:
      </p>
      <p><b>(a) Huygens’ Clocks</b>
      </p>
      <p>It has been noted (originally by Huygens) that similar-type
        pendulum
        clocks mounted on a wall (separated but in a horizontal line)
        which were
        started asynchronously originally would become synchronous in
        due time
        as depicted in Figure 4. This is due to mass movements in a
        straight line
        (i.e., linear momentum effects) which will affect the
        universe-wide vectors
        in that particular line of bobs. Conservation of energy would
        then require
        synergetic actions which would eventually result in the
        synchronization
        of the bob movements. In this case the source of the linear
        momentum was
        localized (the bobs), but a mass movement anywhere in the
        Universe which
        has a strong component in the particular line of the bobs, could
        possibly
        also affect the clocks. Thus some clock error could appear as a
        result!
      </p>
      <p><b>(b) The Foucault Pendulum</b>
      </p>
      <p>This is a simple pendulum used to demonstrate the rotation of
        the earth.
        The bob here is a heavy weight and the suspension wire is many
        meters in
        length. This was done to make the swing period, T, very long and
        the bob
        kinetic energy long enough for many extended swings. Here,
        again, is a
        good example of the repeating action of the rhysmonic
        universe-wide energy
        vector actions which will maintain the plane of the swings
        invariable with
        respect to the fixed rhysmoid (aether) of the Universe. Due to
        the rotation
        of the earth this would result in an apparent rotation of the
        plane of
        the swings of 360 degrees in the course of a day. Hoever, due to
        some other
        effects, this would be true only at the earth’s geographic
        poles. There,
        the Foucault pendulum would be in essence a 24-hour clock!
      </p>
      <p><b>(c) Saxl’s Charged Pendulum Tests</b>
      </p>
      <p>Dr Saxl in 1964 reported in Nature that when a torque-pendulum
        was charged
        positively it took longer to swing through its arc than when
        negatively
        charged! From this he questioned the constancy of G! However,
        rhysmonics
        theory maintains that, G, is a true constant, but that, g, the
        earth’s
        gravitational ‘constant’ could be variable as was considered
        earlier in
        this Note. We can verify Saxl’s observations as shown in Figure
        5 where
        a simple pendulum is charged both positively and negatively. In
        Figure
        5a the bob is charged positively and thus the image of E-fields
        and the
        g-fields are in the same direction. Thus, the weight of the bob
        is reduced
        (‘attracted’ by the g-field). This, in effect, is a reduction in
        g and
        thus the period, T, increases. In Figure 5b, the bob is charged
        negatively
        and thus the image E-field and g-field are in opposition and
        thus the apparent
        weight of the bob is increased. That is, in effect, an increase
        in g and
        thus the period, T, decreases. This is in agreement with Dr
        Saxl’s careful
        observations!
      </p>
      <p><b>C. Conclusions</b>
      </p>
      <p>I have given a few experimentally determined observations which
        are
        readily explained by rhysmonic theory. There are many more such
        evidence
        that I obtained over the years, all of which lend credence to
        the theory.
        Perhaps, some of you may have also discovered other cases?
      </p>
      <p><b>D. Remarks</b>
      </p>
      <p>This is the last long Note I intend to issue this year.
        Perhaps, short
        Notes on some particular aspect may yet be released. Meanwhile,
        over the
        winter period I intend to devote my very limited time to
        completion of
        some seven experimental and demo units which have been
        fabricated, but
        not as yet wired and tested. Some could be quite promising.
