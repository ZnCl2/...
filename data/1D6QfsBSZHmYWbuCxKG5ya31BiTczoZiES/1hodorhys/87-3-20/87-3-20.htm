          energy is
          present in terrestrial space as a potential energy which may
          be released
          as kinetic energy under certain conditions. The energy content
          of gravitation
          in terrestrial space may be determined from the two so-called
          constants
          of gravity; g, the free-fall constant of the earth’s gravity
          field, and
          G, the universal gravity constant. Both of these constants are
          derived
          from experimental data obtained with the use of Newton’s
          gravity relations.
          The earth’s gravity field energy content was calculated by the
          Russian
          physicist, Lev Landau, back in 1962, and is given by the
          simple relation:</font></blockquote>

          gravitation may be converted to kinetic energy in various
          ways, primarily
          by having a mass freely interact with the gravitational field.
          A commonly
          observed interaction is seen in waterfalls, where
          gravitational energy
          is "imparted" to the falling molecules of water and this
          energy is then
          converted usually to rotary mechanical motion by the use of
          water wheels
          or turbines. The energy may then be directly used, or further
          converted
          to electrical energy as is seen in hydroelectric plants.</font></blockquote>

          various evaporation
          processes. In some cases tidal action may be used to achieve a
          water level
          difference, but overall, the system would remain a "closed"

      <blockquote><font face="Times New Roman,Times">However, there are
          also
          non-mechanical methods for "extracting" the latent energy o
          the earth’s
          gravity field. These depend upon the interaction of scalar
          type fields.
          Scalar fields are simply potential fields which are
          conservative in nature
          and contain gradients which are all in one (parallel)
          direction. Thus such
          fields may be described in terms of a magnitude only. The
          earth’s gravity
          field is such a scalar field in that the gravity flux is
          parallel and directed
          downward only, in general. Therefore, such scalar fields may
          interact (algebraically)
          with other locally created scalar fields of the electric type
          (E-fields)
          or magnetic type (H-fields). The scalar E- and H-fields must
          be of the
          curl-free type, i.e., essentially parallel type fields.
          Therefore, it is
          possible, in principle, to have a local scalar field interact
          with the
          gravity scalar field, and thus, in effect, "extract" energy
          from that gravity
          field. Such an energy system would be very low in cost,
          pollution free,
          and an essentially inexhaustible energy source since the
          system does not
          depend upon any terrestrial (solar) energy source such as
          coal, oil, water,
          etc., but is "tapping" instead a universal gravitational
          energy source.
          As such, it is thus not limited by the conservation of energy
          principle
          as in the case of a closed energy system, but would be an
          unlimited open-system
          energy system where the energy is supplied by the universe
          itself. That
          such interactions exist and thus could provide the basis for
          new energy
          sources is illustrated in two very simple experiments.</font></blockquote>

          capacitor is
          "polarized" by the G-fields, resulting in a potential
          difference across
          the capacitor which drives a current, i, across the output
          load, R<sub>L</sub>.
          Since the g-fields are also modulated by various universe and
          terrestrial
          processes, the energy components are both ac and dc in nature.
          Equal capacitors
          (identical) will develop approximately equal open-circuit
          voltages in equal
          time periods due to the presence of the g-fields. A capacitor
          element may
          be connected to an operational amplifier configured in the
          current-to-voltage
          mode of operation to develop and output voltage which will be
          proportional
          to the g-field energy being intercepted by the capacitor at a
          particular
          moment in time. With proper capacitor (dielectric)
          configurations and areas,

          <u>very
            long wire</u> coil of wire will develop a substantial
          magnetic field with
          low drive currents needed [cf. Joe Newman] Thus on the charge
          cycle, a
          small current supplied by the battery, B, will establish a
          stored magnetic
          field in space (as shown by the dotted flux lines) which will
          be in opposition
          to the earth g-fields. On the discharge cycle, the energy
          stored in the
          magnetic field will be returned to the coil along with the
          g-field flux
          (as shown by the solid flux lines). Since both fluxes are of a
          scalar nature
          within the central regions of the coil, they will interact and
          <u>sum</u>,
          since the massive coil is essentially stationary with respect
          to the rhysmoid,
          i.e., the aether. Thus the returned flux is now at least two
          times the
          initial flux and thus the current re-induced in the coil is
          also doubled.
          Therefore, the powering the return cycle is at least squared
          or four times
          the initial power input, for an apparent efficiency of 400%.
          Experiments
          have shown that with proper coil configurations and switching
          times, the
          power "extracted" from the gravity field in this type of
          process can be
          many times the energy required to initiate this interaction.
          This additional
          power comes from the inexhaustible reservoir of energy
          provided by the
          universal gravitational field. Such effects have been
          demonstrated by many
          in the past.</font></p>
