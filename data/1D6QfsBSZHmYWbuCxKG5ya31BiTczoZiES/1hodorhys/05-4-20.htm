      <p><b>A. The Early Years</b>
      </p>
      <p>While I had always been interested in technology and cosmology,
        my Rhysmonic
        Cosmology really got started with some observations noted in the
        early
        1960’s in Dover Publications-released reprints of two classical
        volumes
        (1, 2). Max Planck in his volume noted (as an aside!) the
        existence of
        Natural Units, while Sir William Bragg noted that crystalline
        structures
        could be developed from the closest packing of spheres. Both of
        these notations
        appeared to e to possibly be related to a structure for an
        aether-type
        substrate underlying our sensible everyday Universe! I could
        work on these
        concepts only intermittently, but by about 1970 the essentials
        of my Rhysmonic
        Cosmology had been pretty much worked out.
      </p>
      <p>At about that time I became aware of R. mark’s book (3),
        amplifying
        somewhat on the closest packing of spheres and it bode well for
        the basis
        of my cosmology. When at about 1975, I became acquainted with a
        book on
        R. B. Fuller’s work by R. B. Fuller and R. Marks (4), I was
        struck by how
        similar that work was to my own concepts and thus it
        complemented my views
        quite well! Therefore, I accepted much of Fuller’s terminology
        and insights,
        the only differences I had were that in rhysmonics, (a) a plane
        could be
        finite, (b) a circle could contain only 360°, and (c), the
        Universe
        was Euclidian in basic structure! I recommend that volume,
        especially the
        Chapter on Energetic-Synergetic Geometry!
      </p>
      <p><b>B. The Monograph</b>
      </p>
      <p>In late 1984, <i>Radio-Electronics</i> magazine showed
        interest in my
        article on Gravitational Waves. This was eventually published in
        edited
        form later in 1988 (5). While I released much material (in the
        previous
        years) to a very few colleagues, I had worried (at that time)
        that a general
        release to a much larger readership could raise doubts and
        questions. That
        proved to be true since <i>Radio-Electronics</i> was quite
        overwhelmed
        with reader responses to that article! By the way, the response
        was mostly
        favorable!
      </p>
      <p>Therefore, for that reason, I decided to pre-release my efforts
        in a
        short Monograph (6). I released that volume well before the R-E
        article
        appeared! I had only about 60 copies of the Monograph made and
        about 15
        of those copies were sent gratis to some well-known professional
        researchers
        in this area. The only response I ever received was from the
        editor of
        the Amateur Scientist column in the <i>Scientific American</i>
        magazine!
        He mentioned that he was interested in my material but he would
        never be
        able to get it past the magazine editor!
      </p>
      <p><b>C. In&nbsp; Retrospect</b>
      </p>
      <p>I had originally termed the rhysmonic basic cell structure
        hexagonal
        after Bragg, but it was more generally known as the
        cubo-octahedron in
        crystallography! Fuller’s Vector Equilibrium was more
        descriptive and I
        adopted it for that reason. But a word of caution here: The
        Universe in
        rhysmonics is a very dynamic structure and thus the crystalline
        effects
        are only seen of the universe is stopped in time! Yet, all these
        crystalline
        structures Fuller showed to be possible would still be there (in
        its many
        phases) at each instant of time!
      </p>
      <p>The Universe (in Rhysmonics) is in a continuous vibratory mode
        established
        by the Planck frequency, f*, which is about 1.86 x 10<sup>43</sup>
        Hertz.
        At various sub-harmonic resonances and under the proper
        environmental and
        energy conditions, the Universal Energy of the Universe (i.e.,
        the G-fields)
        could result in microscopic and macroscopic crystallizations of
        all types;
        determine atomic and molecular structures; determine inorganic
        and organic
        structures; and even the highly complex bodily life structures
        and their
        functions! I have shown over the years the many aspects of the
        physical
        interactions possible with verifiable and repeatable results!
        There is
        so much more to be learned here (by others). Planck, Fuller, and
        I hope
        I may have shown the way --- ?
      </p>
      <p><b>D. Conclusions</b>
      </p>
      <p>I know that many others have considered a mechanical (4th
        dimension)
        universe, and possibly some colleagues, but it appears to me
        that the Rhysmonic
        Cosmology version has been proven to be viable. However, it
        needs further
        development. My past efforts are now being made available on the
        Internet
        (www.rexresearch.com). I hope that now many others will become
        involved
        in this effort!
