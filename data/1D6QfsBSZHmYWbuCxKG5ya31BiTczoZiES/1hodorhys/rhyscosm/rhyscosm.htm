        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Cosmology, in its broadest
            sense,
            may be defined as the study of the universe in terms of its
            origin, its
            fundamental makeup, and its development in time. Many
            theories of cosmology
            have been proposed, and each assumes one or more models by
            which various
            phenomena, which are sensed by man or his instruments, are
            explained. Most
            of these theories and models are incomplete and thus leave
            room for alternate
            theories and explanations. Rhysmonic cosmology is a "new"
            theory which
            starts from fundamental premises and therefore builds-up a
            model of the
            universe from a firm foundation. It is the aim of this
            monograph to introduce
            the reader to these new concepts and to lead the reader in
            the development
            of this cosmology in a logical manner.</font>
        </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The theory will not only
            explain
            much of what is assumed to be known of this universe, but
            will also develop
            new knowledge which will lead to testable predictions and
            perhaps new and
            fascinating technologies. The theory also provides logical
            explanations
            for many present day enigmas, especially those of an
            astronomical nature.
            While the author recognizes that this material is yet
            incomplete, sufficient
            information and data will be provided to enable many other
            independent
            investigations into this new cosmology. The author hopes
            that many opt
            to do so.</font>

        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Early man, as the more
            rational and
            inquisitive member of the species inhabiting Earth in his
            time, has always
            been interested in his own origins, and also that of the
            other creatures
            and objects which surrounded him. While he also respected
            the power of
            the sun which provided him with light and warmth during the
            day, he was
            especially awed by the night view of the heavens, which were
            exceptionally
            brilliant as light pollution was very minimal in his time.
            Therefore, to
            satisfy his innate desire to know "why", early man developed
            explanations
            for these objectivities and phenomena which were further
            developed by successive
            generations as folk lore and eventually became the basis for
            various established
            religions. These may be considered the very beginnings of
            cosmology; therefore,
            cosmology is as old as man himself.</font>
        </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Cosmology today may be
            defined in
            may other ways, but, in general, it may be considered as a
            branch of astronomy
            in that is a study of the universe, its origins, structure,
            and development
            in time. There are many cosmological theories, but most
            theories today
            are based on Einstein's relativity theory. The earlier
            classical theories
            of cosmology, which were developed from the times of the
            ancient Greeks
            to about the end of the 19th century, were largely based on
            a mechanistic
            universe involving a hypothetical substratum which
            eventually became known
            as the aether. This transparent and weightless medium was
            imagined by the
            latter period classicists to fill all space and to be the
            medium in which
            electromagnetic radiation could propagate. Since this medium
            was believed
            to have rigid properties, attempts were made to detect its
            properties.
            However, failure to detect this medium in the
            Michelson-Morley experiments
            (and in many other versions since then) finally led to the
            abandonment
            of the aether and also the resulting Newtonian concepts of
            absolute space
            and time.</font>
        </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Cosmology, as developed in
            relativity-based
            theories of recent years, has generated many new terms and
            concepts which
            have aroused the human curiosity. Among the more popular
            concepts are such
            items as the redshift in the positions of the spectral lines
            of distant
            astronomical objects and thus the inferred expansion of the
            universe; the
            "big bang", oscillatory, and steady-state cosmological
            models; the microwave
            background or "fossil" radiation; and the various
            large-scale structures
            of the universe. In addition, many new and exotic items such
            as novae and
            supernovae, black holes, pulsars, quasars, neutron stars,
            etc., to name
            but a few, have been discovered in fact or in theory.
            Present cosmological
            models and theories offer many as hoc explanations for these
            observations
            and thus have many shortcomings, problems, and questions.
            However, there
            is one consistent factor emerging from all these theories
            and that is the
            belief that there should be a fundamental simplicity behind
            the observed
            complexity of the universe. Therefore, it is largely the
            objective of the
            present day cosmologists to determine this basic simplicity
            and thus unite
            the many forces and particles of nature in a unified whole.
            Thus the emphasis
            today on various so-called unified theories of cosmology.</font>

        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Rhysmonic cosmology
            proposes to offer
            a firm base on which to build up a cosmology from
            fundamental premises
            which will provide realistic and consistent explanations for
            all the above
            phenomena and many others. Since it is a basic cosmology, it
            will also
            be shown to be a unified cosmology. In addition, it will be
            shown to be
            capable of new predictions of phenomena which are testable
            in simple direct
            experiments. This will all flow from the basic premises as
            presented in
            the next chapter of this short monograph.</font></p>

        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In a sense, rhysmonic
            cosmology restores
            the substratum aether of the classical era in that an
            underlying structure
            is hypothesized, but this structure is somewhat different
            that was imagined
            by the classicists. Rhysmons are the "particles" of this
            substratum and
            as with the original atoms of Democritus, rhysmons have only
            "size, shape,
            position, and velocity". Nothing else is needed to describe
            them except
            for the definitions of these attributes. For the purpose of
            this monograph,
            rhysmons will be assumed to be extremely small spherical
            "objects". The
            reality of the universe is therefore nothing but rhysmons
            and the void.
            Rhysmons provide the elementary quantum of action and the
            rhysmons intertwine
            or interweave in a matrix structure to form the vacuum which
            is the very
            fabric of the universe. It will be shown later that
            modifications to this
            structure result in the myriad manifestations or phenomena
            in nature. From
            this basis can be constructed the so-called forces or fields
            of nature,
            the nature of particles or mass, the nature of charge, and
            other phenomena,
            as well as definitions for these entities. These
            constructions or models
            can therefore also explain, in simple terms, the more subtle
            phenomena
            in nature, such as the nature of inertia, electromagnetic
            wave propagation,
            red shift, the constant velocity of light, and the
            astronomical paradoxes
            such as quasars, superluminal motions, and galaxy formation,
            to name just
            a few of the phenomena.</font>

        <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Matrix Structure</font></b>
        </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The term rhysmon stems
            from another
            Greek designation for the early atom. "rhysmos", which meant
            "onrush" or
            evermoving since the Greeks considered this entity to never
            be at rest.
            Rhysmons also may be considered to be evermoving in
            contained "orbits"
            as well. In rhysmonic cosmology, the rhysmons intertwine or
            interweave
            with other rhysmons in a close-packed hexagonal structure
            which is very
            much reminiscent of the vector equilibrium of R. Buckminster
            Fuller's energetic-synergetic
            geometry (Ref. 1). It will be shown that such a structure
            results in a
            system of short directed energy vectors which, in free
            space, i.e., the
            vacuum, cancel their energies and thus display no effects or
            phenomena
            which can be "observable". Thus the basic premise: the pure
            rhysmoid or
            the vacuum is not directly observable, but the structure of
            this vacuum
            can be constructed from a logical basis as is shown in this
            cosmology.</font>

        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The simplified
            constructions of <b>Figures
              1</b> through <b>5</b> are based on Cartesian coordinates
            and thus Euclidian
            geometry. Another basic premise in rhysmonic cosmology is
            that the pure
            rhysmonic structure, i.e., the vacuum, is Euclidian in
            geometry throughout
            the entire universe. This means that Euclidian type
            "straight" lines exist
            in this universe. The vectors as depicted in these figures,
            especially
            those shown in <b><a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a></b>, are
            seen to form Euclidian
            type straight lines with directed rhysmonic vectors joining
            head-to-tail.
            For any one particular straight line this is an
            "instantaneous vector"
            which spans the universe from edge to edge (the universe was
            shown to be
            a finite sphere). A particular configuration exists for
            Planck Time, T*,
            or about 5.4 x 1<sup>-44</sup> seconds, when rhysmonic
            "orbiting" causes
            other rhysmons which have reversed orbital orientation to
            appear in any
            chosen reference "line", and thus the vectors the vectors
            also reverse
            direction. In time, T*, later again, the vectors are
            restored to the original
            directions, <u>but</u> the original rhysmon does not return
            to this original
            position until a time period of 6T* has passed. Since this
            directional
            reversal occurs for each straight line instantaneous vector
            in the entire
            universe every 5.4 x 10<sup>-44
            </sup>seconds, the universe is like a movie
            or cinema, where each single frame or picture in the cinema
            of existence
            lasts for only 5.4 x 10<sup>-44</sup> seconds. This
            representation of the
            structure of the universe has two significant conclusions:
            (1) Individual
            rhysmons are limited are limited in movement to an "orbit"
            having a radius
            of Planck Length, L*, or about 1.6 x 10<sup>-33</sup>
            centimeters, and
            (2) rhysmonic effects in each "straight line" are
            instantaneous vectors
            which span the universe and reverse in Planck Time, T*, or
            about 5.4 x
            10<sup>-44</sup> seconds. Thus it is possible in rhysmonic
            cosmology to
            ascertain that two events in different parts of the universe
            do occur at
            the same time, within a measurement error of Planck Length,
            L*, or Planck
            Time, T*. Thus rhysmonic cosmology restores, in essence, the
            absolute space
            and time of Newton. The concepts disclosed in this paragraph
            are very important
            for the later discussion of forces and fields as well as
            particles and
            charge. It will be shown to be especially significant in the
            discussion
            of gravitation.</font>

        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Currently popular
            cosmological models
            for the universe generally fall within three broad
            categories: the Big
            Bang version, the Oscillatory version, and the Steady-State
            versions. There
            are many individual interpretations within each broad
            category, depending
            upon the proponent's general viewpoints. However, each
            general class has
            some common features as follows: in the Big bang version,
            the universe
            is supposed to have begun as a "primeval" atom which
            contained <u>all</u>
            the mass of the universe. This "atom" exploded about 15
            billion years or
            so ago, resulting in the apparent expansion seen today. In
            the Oscillatory
            version, the universe does not expand forever, but because
            of self-gravitation,
            stops, and then collapses to the "primeval" atom state again
            to repeat
            the cycle. In Steady-State versions, constant mass and mean
            density is
            postulated. Since the "observed" expansion of the universe
            is also recognized,
            these theories call for the continuous creation of matter in
            some manner
            to maintain the mean density constant.</font>
        </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">As noted above, the
            current theories
            all postulate expansion of the universe as evidenced by the
            Hubble relation
            of velocity-distance for the galaxies. In addition, various
            geometries
            are also postulated, for example, Einstein's 4-dimensional
            space. This
            all results in the necessity for many ad hoc explanations
            for these various
            effects. However, rhysmonic cosmology, since it starts with
            very basic
            premises as briefly outlined in the previous chapter,
            effectively eliminated
            the need for such ad hoc explanations and thus is a general
            theory for
            all effects and phenomena without invoking any additional
            assumptions.</font>

        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The size of the universe
            depends
            only on the total number of rhysmons involved and the size
            of the matrix
            cell. The present size of the matrix cell is established by
            Planck's Natural
            Units as applied to the vector equilibrium structure of the
            basic cell
            described previously. Perhaps the size of the universe can
            eventually be
            determined from the size of the basic cell structure. While
            the basic cell
            structures could be combined to yield almost any shape for
            the universe,
            it can be shown that the optimum use of the available energy
            content would
            require that the universe be spherical in shape. The present
            energy of
            a single rhysmon is determinable from the Planck Constant
            and his Natural
            Units. Therefore, the since the rhysmonic universe builds up
            from very
            basic fundamental structures, there is no need for expensive
            atom-smashing
            experiments to finally arrive at this same basic structure.
            Instead of
            working down from complexity to basics, as in present day
            high-energy physics,
            rhysmonic cosmology works up from basics to the ore complex
            structures
            and phenomena. The complexities of nature are but
            modifications or perturbations
            in the pure rhysmoid (vacuum) universe. Rhysmonic cosmology
            does not preclude
            the existence of other universes in the void, or the
            possibility of collisions
            between universes, nor the possibility that universes might
            gain or lose
            rhysmons which may be out there "floating" in the void.</font>

            matter regions of the universe. Rhysmonics does not preclude
            that under
            highly localized conditions other geometries could and
            probably do exist.
            However, on a large scale, e.g., astronomical dimensions,
            use of Euclidian
            geometry would still be valid, which is contrary to the

            previous
            chapter, the close-packed hexagonal structure of the basic
            matrix cell
            leads to universe-wide "instantaneous vectors" which reverse
            in Planck
            Time, T*. Consider the planar cell structure of <b><a

            Note the directions
            of the vectors depicted. At Planck Time, T*, later, all
            these vectors will
            reverse direction, no matter what was the direction of their
            arrival, i.e.,
            the vector field is returned or <u>reflected</u>. Since the
            overall surface
            of the universe is a sphere, the inside edge of the universe
            is in essence
            a concave spherical mirror. As such it has all the
            properties of any concave
            spherical mirror in terms of geometric optics based on
            Euclidian geometry.
            This concept is significant and crucial to the development
            of matter (particles,
            atoms, molecules, galaxies, etc.) in the universe as well as
            such effects

            constructed in rhysmonic
            cosmology. It has already been postulated in concept that
            the universe
            is a perfect sphere with the edge acting as a perfect
            spherical mirror
            for rhysmonic vectors. It will be shown later that
            electromagnetic and
            gravitational signals are but special manifestations of

            thus these signals or effects are also perfectly "reflected"

        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It is also indicated in
            Figure 6
            that matter (mass) particles form out to only about the half
            radius point
            in the rhysmoid universe. This is primarily due to two
            factors as depicted
            in <b><a href="#fig6">Figure 6</a></b>. First, due to the
            rhysmoid's hexagonal
            geometry, ideal 60° reflections from the edge of the
            universe will
            be limited to the outer one-half radius, thus helping to
            maintain this
            outer
            region a pure rhysmoid. Second, any perturbations within the
            center half
            of the rhysmoid sphere will reflect of the spherical edge of
            the universe
            to the focal plane which is also the edge of the center
            sphere, thus also
            tending to maintain the outer half-radius as pure rhysmoid.
            By the same
            token, perturbations at the focal plane can be reflected off
            the edge of
            the universe and could possibly be statistically combined at
            different
            points in the matter region, creating additional excesses
            and deficiencies
            of rhysmons which will be shown to be the "matter" of the
            universe. The
            matter created at the focal plane would diffuse under
            gravitational effects
            toward the center of the universe. Gravitational effects
            would also develop
            large-scale structure in matter "created" in the central
            regions of the
            universe. Some additional matter could perhaps be created in
            shock action
            with possible "collisions" between universes. It is believed
            that the earth
            is located well off-center in the matter portion of this
            universe model.</font>

        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Definitions for mass
            (matter) and
            energy (work) have appeared in many forms. For the most
            part, mass has
            been defined as that quality in a particle or body which has
            the property
            of resisting a change in motion, i.e., it has inertia.
            Matter, in turn,
            has been defined as that which occupies space and has
            weight, i.e., it
            is affected by the earth’s gravity. In even more simple
            terms, matter has
            been defined merely as a collection of atoms, since atoms
            contain many
            of the more "fundamental" particles of nature which have the
            above characteristics.
            Energy, on the other hand, has been defined as a property
            that is a measure
            of the capacity to do work. More precisely, it is the
            capacity to do work
            by overcoming resistance, e.g., inertia. Energy may appear
            in many forms,
            but always in conjunction with "mass". Thus mass (matter)
            and energy (work)
            are very closely related as has been shown in the relation:
            E = mc<sup>2</sup>

        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The mechanical concepts
            considered
            in the previous paragraphs are applicable to the so-called
            "particles"
            of physics at both the macroscopic and microscopic levels.
            It will be shown
            that these concepts have their basis from the nature of the
            substratum,
            i.e., the vacuum or the matrix cell structure. As was
            described in the
            previous development of rhysmonic basics, the universe
            consists of only
            rhysmons and the void. Therefore, rhysmonic mechanics must
            stem from the
            rhysmons in this matrix structure. While some innate
            properties can be
            derived from the basic matrix structure, the development of
            most mechanical
            concepts require a "perturbation" or disturbance in the
            normal free space
            configuration of the matrix cell in order to manifest itself
            in the macroscopic
            or microscopic levels as an effect which is "observable". A
            prime concept
            involved is that of inertia which has already been
            mentioned. Inertia must
            now be considered in more detail.</font>
        </p>
        <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Inertia</font></b>
        </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Inertia has been loosely
            defined
            in most mechanics as an observed resisting force to a change
            in matter’s
            initial state of rest or motion, but once changed, the
            inertial force tends
            to keep the altered motion uniform in a straight line. This
            behavior is
            simply explained at the rhysmonic level of the basic cell
            structure in
            free space. In <b><a href="#fig5">Figure (5)</a></b> a
            planar view of rhysmonic
            structure in a repeating hexagonal construction over an
            extended plane
            was shown. As depicted there, at any "instant" of Planck
            Time, rhysmonic
            vectors are all oriented in a particular "direction" in
            space, but then
            the vector directions are reversed in the next instant of
            Planck Time.
            Since all vectors are in equilibrium in an undisturbed
            vacuum, <u>no</u>
            effect is observable. However, if available energy is used
            in some manner
            to enable a rhysmon to gain some additional finite energy,
            say in the direction
            AB shown in <b><a href="#fig5">Figure (5)</a></b>, the
            directed vector
            will be changed by this incremental amount of energy in the
            direction of
            the "instantaneous" or
            <u>straight line</u> vector which contained the
            affected vector. Since the vacuum is a perfect "machine",
            balance of forces
            in this matrix system will require an apparent movement of
            this "disturbance"
            along this line at the rate of the initial energy increase,
            <u>forever</u>,
            unless perturbated or disturbed again. By the same token, to
            stop this
            progression would require the equivalent amount o energy to
            be expended
            in the reverse direction in order to restore the previous
            status quo. This
            simple depiction of inertia, involving but a single rhysmon,
            is an oversimplification,
            but it does illustrate the basic mechanism involved and also
            forms the
            basis for space and time "dilation" as postulated in
            relativity theories.
            It is apparent, even from this simple picture, that rhysmons
            cannot receive
            more energy than that of the "jump" enrgy, i.e., that
            involved in a single
            rhysmonic directed vector (the reduced Planck Constant
            Energy), or dilation
            effects would result in a solid mass of rhysmons whose
            energies could no
            longer be overcome. With the multitudes of rhysmons involved
            with mass
            or particles, some with possible charge, other effects such
            as electromagnetic
            fields and other field effects would make the situation much
            more complex,
            but it would not change the basic conception of inertia as
            given here.
            Inertia exists because the vacuum exists.</font>

        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The concept of particles
            has existed
            from the earliest of times since it is a natural conclusion
            derived by
            man from general observations of his surroundings, e.g., the
            presence of
            sand and dust. Using logical considerations, this was
            extended down to
            the concept of atoms by the early Greek philosophers.
            However, the concepts
            of fields and charge were more recent considerations by man,
            receiving
            serious contemplations mainly during the 19<sup>th</sup>
            century years.
            This work by a great number of theorists and experimenters
            in this "classical"
            period had resulted in a physics and cosmology which was so
            complete to
            some workers as to suggest that little more could be
            learned. However,
            the advance of science led to a "modern" physics with newer
            concepts and
            ideas such as nuclear physics and the theory of relativity,
            and classical
            physics was relegated to the "back burner", so to speak. It
            will be shown,
            however, that while classical physics and cosmology were
            incomplete, the
            foundations for a true and realistic cosmology were still
            there. Rhysmonic
            cosmology proposes to rebuild this foundation and thus
            reestablish an updated
            classical-type physics as the more correct approach to our
            knowledge of
            the universe.</font>

        <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Rhysmonic Concepts</font></b>
        </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Particles may be defined
            in many
            ways, but in general, they may be considered an
            <u>entity</u> in the vacuum
            which is "observable" by man or his instruments. Additional
            requirements
            are that this entity have locality, or position, and also
            the attribute
            called inertia. Developments in rhysmonic cosmology thus far
            have shown
            that these considerations require perturbations in the
            structure of the
            pure rhysmoid or vacuum. In essence, particles in rhysmonic
            cosmology must
            be the result of changes in the "density" of this rhysmonic
            structure,
            since the universe is nothing more than rhysmons and the
            void. This may
            be achieved essentially by a "tightening" or "loosening" of
            the hexagonal
            matrix structure, most likely as a spherical perturbation.
            This is depicted
            in the planar views of <b><a href="#fig7">Figure 7</a></b>,
            where simple
            illustrations can explain many o the properties of particles
            such s proton,
            neutron, and electron as well as their anti-particles.</font>
        </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A tightened matrix
            structure is depicted
            by the cross-hatched circles in these illustrations and the
            loosened matrix
            structure by the open circles. The tightened structure has
            many more rhysmons
            than the normal background (vacuum), while the loosened
            structure has much
            fewer. The extra rhysmons which make up the tightened
            structure must, of
            necessity, have come from the loosened structure. Thus
            particles, in essence,
            are created in pairs, one high density and an equivalent low
            density one.
            Since rhysmons have energy, work is required to be expended
            to restructure
            the vacuum and thus create these particles. An excess of
            rhysmons, as in
            the shaded circles, becomes a <u>source</u> of excess
            directed rysmonic
            vectors which influence the vacuum structure as a stress <u>field</u>,
            or as is observed in classical physics, an electric field.
            The excess region
            is said to contain <u>positive charge</u> since it is a <u>source</u>
            of
            excess <u>out-directed</u> rhysmonic vectors. The open
            circle areas, which
            have a deficiency of rhysmons compared to the vacuum
            background, also causes
            a stress field. The deficient region is said to contain <u>negative
              charge</u>
            as it is a <u>sink</u> for <u>in-directed</u> rhysmonic
            vectors. <b><a href="#fig7">Figure
                (7a)</a></b> also shows in a simple way the nature of
            the "attractive force"
            between particles of opposite charge. As depicted here, the
            excess rhysmonic
            vectors <u>between</u> the two particles are in the <u>same</u>
            direction
            and thus the balance of forces required by the vacuum causes
            these two
            entities to progress or move toward each other, in an
            apparent attractive
            force. The method of progression will be considered in
            electromagnetics
            in conjunction with a depiction of magnetic fields. Shown in
            <b><a href="#fig7">Figure
                (7b)</a></b> is a simple illustration of the "repulsive
            force" between
            two like charges, say two protons. The excess rhysmonic
            directed vectors
            <u>between</u>
            these particles are in opposition and thus the balance of
            forces of the
            vacuum will require the particles to progress or move away
            from each other,
            in an apparent repulsive force. To cause these particles to
            approach each
            other will require additional work to overcome the energy of
            these opposing
            vectors. Thus, in essence, the nature of charge is pretty
            much as was imagined
            by the classicists.</font>
        </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Shown in <b><a
                href="#fig7">Figure
                (7c)</a></b> is the possible configurations in
            rhysmonics for the neutron
            and anti-neutron and other possible neutral particles. The
            neutron may
            be considered to be basically a proton but to contain a
            reduced density
            center region roughly equivalent to the electron in
            structure. Therefore,
            excess directed vectors <u>cancel</u> within this
            configuration, and since
            no <u>external</u> excess-directed vectors are "seen", no
            charge effects
            are apparent. The anti-neutron has the inverse structure of
            the neutron
            and also shows no charge due to a similar cancellation of
            excess directed
            vectors. Other more complex structure may be built-up from
            these basic
            concepts as well as some other concepts, to create the
            myriad particles
            of physics. For example, nuclear structure, e.g., the liquid
            drop model,
            could be considered to have the above neutron-type structure
            in which the
            positive excess directed vectors are not completely
            cancelled. The remaining
            out-directed vectors terminate on surrounding electrons and
            thus serve
            to "attract" and hold these electrons in various atomic
            structures.</font>

            have been
            a pure rhysmoid, i.e., a pure vacuum, in the beginning. It

            into the spherical matrix structure of today with the
            continual collection
            of rhysmons from the void. With this conjecture as a
            starting point, a

            rhysmons "locked"
            their energies into the "equalized" matrix structure which
            forms this universe.
            The only initial energy "force", to use this term loosely,
            was the "instantaneous"
            vector field, which was also the equalizing mechanism in the
            rhysmoid.
            This process resulted in the "perfect mechanical" universe
            mentioned previously.</font>

            impacts of unusually
            energetic incoming rhysmoids, possible collision with
            another universe
            (which will result in essentially a big-bang type of energy
            increase),
            or just the normal fluctuations which could be attributed to
            such a system.
            In any event, the only "observable" phenomena in this early
            universe would
            be electromagnetic fields and possibly some gravitational
            effects. Therefore,
            any particle creation must have stemmed from this radiant
            energy.</font>

        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A mechanism for particle
            production
            from radiant energy is still observable today in the
            so-called pair production
            and annihilation phenomena. This mechanism in rhysmonics is
            slightly modified
            but would still largely apply to electron-positron
            production because of
            energy considerations. This mechanism is depicted in <b><a
                href="#fig8">Figure
                (8a)</a></b>. It is postulated here that if two
            electromagnetic impulses
            (photons of the proper energy and phase) meet from <u>opposite</u>
            directions
            at a point in space, this energy, in principle, could
            restructure the vacuum
            into two entities, where one now has an increased rhysmonic
            density and
            the other has an equivalent reduced density, i.e., a
            positron and an electron
            are created. These two entities would then move off in
            opposite directions
            (orthogonal to the photons) with an energy (kinetic) as left
            over in this
            process. It should be remembered that this process is a
            function of two
            photons and thus does not require the presence of another

        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">While the above could
            account for
            positron-electron production, the universe is known to be
            largely composed
            of protons and electrons. Some positrons (under certain
            conditions) could
            possibly combine to form protons. However, rhysmonics offers
            other mechanisms
            for proton creation. One would be similar to that given for
            positron-electron
            production, where the interacting photons would have
            sufficient energy
            to produce proton-antiproton particles. If annihilation does
            not take place,
            then the proton (which is quite stable) would continue to
            exist, while
            the antiproton may perhaps decay eventually into electrons.
            Anther more
            energy efficient mechanism may be that depicted in <b><a
                href="#fig8">Figure
                (8b)</a></b>. Instead of forming a proton-antiproton
            pair, a rhysmonic
            neutron is formed as indicated here. The neutron, being
            somewhat unstable,
            also eventually decays to a stable proton and a stable
            electron. Therefore,
            the early universe may have been largely protons, electrons,
            and the "captured"
            form of the pair, the hydrogen atom. Moreover, since protons
            contain much
            more of the "frozen or locked" rhysmons than electrons,
            there should be
            more free or trapped electrons in the universe. While
            hydrogen atoms are
            very much in abundance in the universe,, the buildup of of
            atomic structures
            of greater complexity was, of necessity, required to further
            balance the
            charge nature of the universe which developed under these
            conditions. Therefore,
            the excess electrons, or some form of negative charge,
            either as free or
            captured entities, must be accounted for. The nature and
            mechanisms for
            these processes should make an interesting branch in the
            study of rhysmonic
            cosmology.</font>

        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Many aspects of electric
            and magnetic
            fields had been fairly well established by the classical
            physicists of
            the 19<sup>th</sup> century. Electromagnetic radiation
            "effects" were probably
            noticed by the 19<sup>th</sup> century physicists and
            experimenters, notably
            Michael Faraday, but do not appear to have pursued further.
            Therefore,
            it wasn’t until about the end of that century before
            electromagnetic radiation,
            theoretically predicted by James Clerk Maxwell, was finally
            conclusively
            generated and detected in the experiments of Heinrich
            Rudolph Hertz. Not
            much was done with these signals, however, until [Nikola
            Tesla and] Gugliemo
            Marconi demonstrated in 1901 that long-range communication
            using these
            signals was feasible. At this time the inquisitive and
            knowledgeable experimenter
            became involved and amateur radio as a hobby and avocation
            was born. These
            dedicated experimenters probably did more for the
            development of radio
            than any other group until the accelerated development
            programs of World
            War II.</font>
        </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The work of "modern"
            physicists has
            elucidated on these developments, but has added very little
            to the basics
            or in fundamentally new concepts. Much effort has been
            expended to mathematically
            define particles and fields from their observed effects
            only, since relativity
            physicists have effectively "squelched" any real attempts to
            model electromagnetics
            on a material or mechanical basis. Since rhysmonic cosmology
            starts with
            a simple basic matrix structure for the substratum, or
            vacuum, a material
            and "perfect mechanical" universe is once more feasible.
            Some concepts,
            which have already been applied to particles and electric
            fields, will
            now be considered with respect to magnetic fields, and of
            necessity, to
            the concept of the electromagnetic field.</font>

        <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Rhysmonic Magnetics</font></b>
        </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In the discussion on mass
            and energy,
            the concept of inertia at the rhysmonics level was
            considered on the basis
            of a single rhysmon. When this is extended to the multitude
            of rhysmons
            of a particle (but without charge), it can be shown that the
            process of
            inertia now also involves a concept called "spin" for the
            movement of a
            mass or particle within the "sea of rhysmons" formed by the
            mass structure
            of the vacuum. In essence, the particle must perform sort of
            a "cork screw"
            motion where the circumferential vectors now "rotate" at the
            velocity of
            light, but the translational of inertial velocity of the
            system proceeds
            at the macroscoic speed of the added energy increment given
            this system.
            To a large measure, these concepts are in agreement with
            those which were
            established by the classical physicists many years ago.
            However, in the
            case of a particle which has charge, say an electron, in
            addition to this
            property called spin, there is a new action called the
            magnetic moment,
            due to the excess directed rhysmonic vectors associated with
            the charged
            particle. Thus, it has long been recognized that a moving
            charge will generate
            a new effect known as the magnetic fields, e.g., a flow of
            electrons in
            a wire will create a stress condition in the vacuum around
            this wire which
            has the properties known as a magnetic field in classical
            physics</font>
        </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Rhysmonics, therefore,
            shows that
            the magnetic field is due to the interaction of the excess
            directed rhysmonic
            vectors of a rotating charge region, as depicted for the
            electron in <b><a href="#fig9">Figure
                (9)</a></b>. Here the electron is depicted to be
            "spinning" counterclockwise
            as it moves up and out of the paper. The excess directed
            vectors can affect
            the circumferentials shown, adding their energies to these
            vectors, and
            causing the magnetic moment to be created. Therefore, the
            magnetic field
            is a closed loop of excessively rotating rhysmonic vectors,
            giving reality
            to the flux lines as imagined by Faraday and the
            classicists, as well as
            that seen in the well-known image formed by iron filings
            surrounding a
            current-carrying wire. Since the rhysmons are directed
            vectors, the flux
            line "flow" is also as that which was imagined by the
            classicist, i.e.,
            that given by the right-hand rule. From <b><a href="#fig9">Figure
                (9)</a></b>,
            it can be shown (from Euclidian geometry) that the strength
            of the circumferential
            vectors, i.e., the magnetic field, will fall off inversely
            with the square
            of the radius. Thus rhysmonics provides a logical
            explanation for the fall
            off of these field strengths which have been determined from
            experiment.</font>

        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The translation of charge
            has been
            sown to cause an interaction with the surrounding
            circumferential rhysmonic
            vectors. Since the vacuum is a "perfect machine", balance of
            forces will
            require an apparent rotational movement of these vectors,
            and the rotational
            energy (or curl) will be sustained as long as the lateral
            movement of charge
            is sustained. This simple picture indicates that a moving
            charge, i.e.,
            a dynamic electric field, must, of necessity, also bring
            into existence
            at the same time, a dynamic magnetic field. By the same
            token, a changing
            or dynamic magnetic field will bring into existence a
            movement of rhysmons
            which leads to a charge and thus a resultant electric field.
            As a consequence,
            energy may be stored alternately in these two aspects of
            rhysmonic fields.
            A sustained movement of charge will result in a sustained
            magnetic field,
            i.e., the magnetic field will be in a sustained stress in
            the vacuum and
            thus a storehouse of energy. Sudden release of this stress
            would result
            in a rapid movement of radial rhysmons and thus an intense
            electric field.
            Energy can also be stored in this electric field. The rapid
            interchange
            of stressed rhysmonic energy between the magnetic mode and
            the electric
            mode of storage is known as an oscillatory discharge in
            electronics. Therefore,
            under dynamic conditions, we cannot speak of just an
            electric field or
            just a magnetic field, but only of an interacting
            electromagnetic field.</font>

        </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A dynamic electromagnetic
            field has
            an additional interesting property in that the interacting
            fields result
            in a propagation effect in free space (the vacuum) which is
            known as an
            electromagnetic wave or EM radiation. A seldom-used
            illustration of this
            process is shown in <b><a href="#fig10">Figure (10a)</a></b>.
            This is the
            "link chain" interpretation of EM wave propagation. Here the
            fields are
            depicted as closed loop vectors for not only the magnetic
            component, but
            also the electric component. The H-field loops are shown
            lying in the plane
            of the paper, while the E-field loops are shown directed
            into the paper
            at (-), thus completing the loop. The direction of
            propagation is seen
            to be at right angles to both these components. This closed
            loop interpretation
            of EM wave propagation indicates a quarter wavelength or 90°
            phase
            shift between the electric and magnetic components, which is
            not depicted
            in most EM wave illustrations. This appears to be a
            necessary requirement
            of the directed vector construction of the vacuum of the
            universe. The
            loops are shown as circular in this depiction of the
            universe. The loops
            are shown as circular in this depiction for illustrative
            purposes only.
            It should be noted that the depiction is symmetrical, i.e.,
            the E-components
            can be interchanged with the H-components, and vice versa,
            without affecting
            the nature of this propagation. This symmetry is also
            apparent in the form
            of Maxwells’ equations for EM waves.</font>

        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">When viewed under the
            substratum
            conditions of the rhysmonic matrix structure, this
            propagation process
            has some interesting consequences. As was seen in the planar
            view of circumferential
            vectors in the basic matrix structure of<b> <a href="#fig1">Figure
                (10)b</a></b>,
            the closest approach of any two adjacent parallel directed
            rhysmonic vectors
            is approximately two times the Planck Length, or 2L*, which
            is equal to
            about 3.2 x 10<sup>-33</sup> centimeters. Since the magnetic
            component
            in electromagnetic propagation is at right angles to the
            direction of propagation,
            and since curl or a rotational vector geometry is also
            involved, magnetic
            field reversal as seen in the depiction of <b><a
                href="#fig10">Figure (10a)</a></b>
            cannot take place closer than this closest approach of
            parallel directed
            rhysmonic vectors, or 2L*. This concept is clarified in the
            simplified
            sketch of
            <b><a href="#fig10">Figure (10b)</a></b>. Here the magnetic
            closed
            loop vectors (which are really circumferential vectors) are
            shown, but
            the closed loop electric field vectors (which are really
            radial vectors)
            are shown only by (+) where they enter the paper and (-)
            where they return
            out of the paper. Again, the magnetic rotational vectors
            cannot approach
            closer than the basic cell structure shown here. It should
            be noted that
            this basic cell could, in a broad sense, be considered as
            the "idler wheel"
            imagined by Maxwell in his mechanical model of EM fields.
            Therefore, for
            each magnetic field reversal, i.e., for each half wavelength
            of EM propagation,
            the wavelength must <u>increase</u> by this increment, 2L*,
            or by 4L* per
            full wavelength. Since this increment is independent of
            wavelength, it
            is a linear factor and is also the observed "Hubble Factor",
            but it should
            be remembered that E- and H-components may also be
            interchanged in this
            depiction. However, from symmetry, it is seen that the
            electric field component
            reversal also requires an increment of 4L* per wavelength.
            However, since
            both components are increased equally, the overall wave has
            a uniform expansion
            with wavelength of this same fixed amount of 4L*. Thus the
            longer EM waves
            travel in space, the more the wavelength increases. This
            process accounts
            for the so-called redshift in the spectra of distant
            galaxies.</font>

            in the cinema
            of existence lasting for Planck Time, T*, a rhysmonic field
            reversal, e.g.,
            the magnetic reversal, must occur only after a new frame has
            begun, i.e.,
            after this time interval of T* has passed. But also in this
            time interval
            a rhysmonic vector has moved or "jumped" a distance of
            Planck Length, L*.
            Therefore, the translation of these rhysmonic "effects" is
            Planck Length,

        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The force of gravity was
            probably
            the earliest "force" to be recognized by man. early man
            realized that objects
            has weight and when a supported object ws released he
            noticed that it would
            always fall to theground. This force was very mysterious to
            him and has
            remained more or less mysterious to this very day. While
            gravitation was
            the first of the fundamental laws of physics to be
            discovered, it was also
            found to be the weakest of the three major forces noted thus
            far in our
            universe. The other two forces, the electromagnetic and
            nuclear forces,
            are many, many orders of magnitude stronger. However, the
            gravitational
            force, in a sense, may be considered more fundamental since
            it requires
            only the presence of mass in order to exist, while the other
            forces also
            require the presence of charge to exist.</font>
        </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">While gravitation was
            recognized
            as a force very early, the development of a quantitative
            expression for
            this force was a long time in coming. It was finally summed
            up in the laws
            of universal gravitation by Isaac Newton early in the 18<sup>th</sup>
            century.
            During the 18<sup>th</sup> and 19<sup>th</sup> centuries,
            Newtonian gravitation
            was further developed and applied to many problems in
            physics and astronomy.
            It remained unchallenged until the advent of the theory of
            relativity by
            Albert Einstein early in the 20<sup>th</sup> century. At
            this time a geometric
            interpretation for the "force" of gravity was proposed.</font>
        </p>
        <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Newtonian Gravity</font></b>
        </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">While Newton never arrived
            at a mechanism
            for gravitation, he was a staunch believer in the aether
            theory and had
            a strong conviction that the mechanism somehow lay in the
            aether. A hypothesis
            was proposed somewhat later by G.L. LeSage, a French Swiss,
            that "ultra-mundane
            corpuscles" in the aether were responsible for the effect of
            gravitation.
            While Newton did not express it directly so, both he and
            LeSage really
            proposed a "Mechanical Particle" view of gravitation.
            However, these concepts
            were not pursued seriously then, since the success of the
            mathematical
            interpretation of gravitation appeared to outweigh any need
            for a mechanical
            explanation of gravitational effects.</font>
        </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Newton’s law of universal
            gravitation
            suggests that every bit of matter, i.e., mass, in the
            universe "attracts"
            every other bit of matter in the universe, with a "force"
            which was proportional
            to their mass and inversely proportional to the square of
            the distance
            between them. In the CGS system of units, this statement can
            be expressed
            as an equation, by introducing a proportionality constant,
            G. Therefore,
            the law is generally presented as:</font>
        </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">F = Gm<sub>1</sub>m<sub>2</sub>
            /D<sup>2</sup></font>
        </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Where G is approximately
            equal to
            6.672 x 10<sup>-8</sup> dyne-cm<sup>2</sup>/gm<sup>2</sup>.
            This would
            mean that if m<sub>1</sub> and m<sub>2</sub> were two
            spherical masses
            of 1 gm each, and were placed exactly 1 cm apart (between
            centers), the
            so-called force of attraction between them would be the
            factor of 6.672
            x 10<sup>-8</sup> dynes seen in the value of G.</font>
        </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">This relation and the
            three Newton
            laws of motion form the basis of Newtonian mechanics. In
            addition, such
            concepts as work and energy can be developed on these
            premises. Another
            concept arising in Newtonian gravitation is that of "action
            at a distance",
            which implies an "instantaneous" action. Newton had no
            explanation for
            this other than that the effect existed. Since Newtonian
            gravitation is
            essentially a mechanical theory (as is relativity), it
            provides largely
            a macroscopic view, integrating many microscopic effects and
            possibly some
            substratum effects, in its overview. Therefore, both are
            somewhat incomplete,
            and thus may lead to some erroneous conclusions under
            certain conditions.
            However, the author’s "new" theory of cosmology has very
            basic premises
            which provide for a firm foundation on which can be
            constructed a universe
            in which both classical gravitation and relativistic
            gravitation can be
            shown to be but broad overviews of rhysmonic theory.
            Rhysmonic cosmology
            will demonstrate that all known (and many unknown)
            gravitational effects
            can be derived from the basic matrix structure of the
            rhysmoid as developed
            in the basic premises of this theory.</font>

        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It had been shown (in
            terms of rhysmonics)
            that the universe is a finite, spherical, and perfect black
            body in that
            all forms of radiant energy are reflected from the edge of
            the universe.
            This is a direct result of the matrix structure of the
            vacuum and the rhysmonic
            energy vector concept. For example, the "instantaneous"
            energy vectors
            as depicted in <b><a href="#fig5">Figure (5)</a></b>, are
            returned or reflected
            at the universe edge by the same process of vector reversal
            as was discussed
            in Chapter 2. These instantaneous vectors are fundamental to
            a discussion
            of rhysmonic gravitation effects.</font>

        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The determination of the
            laws of
            gravitation and the mechanism for gravitation in terms of
            rhysmonics is
            depicted in <b><a href="#fig11">Figure (11)</a>.
            </b>Consider a lone mass,
            A, located at the exact center of a pure rhysmoid universe,
            i.e., an undisturbed
            vacuum universe, as is shown in
            <b><a href="#fig11">Figure (11)</a>.</b>
            No other masses are assumed to be present in this universe.
            From Euclidian
            geometrical symmetry it is seen that the instantaneous
            rhysmonic vector
            impulses on this test particle are exactly equal for all
            possible angles
            of arrival. Therefore, since all impulses are equal, the
            particle remains
            at "rest" and no net force is present. Now consider the lone
            test particle
            to be located off-center in the rhysmoid universe at
            position B. Again,
            it can be shown by Euclidian geometry that all instantaneous
            rhysmonic
            impulses arriving at this test particle would also be equal,
            and thus again
            no net force would be present. In a similar manner, it can
            be shown that
            a lone mass, located anywhere in the rhysmoid universe will
            have no net
            force on it and thus will be at rest. Therefore, there will
            be no external
            gravitational effect in the universe if it contains only one
            mass, even
            though the region of this mass is a perturbed section of the
            rhysmoid or
            vacuum. Of course, the particle itself will be partially
            held together
            by the internal gravitational effects between the individual
            rhysmons which
            go to make up this particular particle.</font>

            case where
            <u>two</u>
            masses, A and B, are present in the universe. Again, the
            instantaneous
            vectors will be generally equalized, <u>except</u> for the
            impulses which
            are in a direct line with the two test particles. Here, due
            to the "screening"
            action of the masses, there will be more impulses on the
            sides away from
            each other than on the sides facing each other. The two
            masses will thus
            be "impelled" towards each other, which, from the outside
            would appear
            to be a force of "attraction". This is due to the fact that
            a massive particle
            implies a tightened matrix structure which delays the
            transmission of rhysmonic
            impulses through such a structure. It can be shown that this
            force would
            be proportional to the number of rhysmons in these particles
            i.e., the
            masses, and inversely proportional to the distance between
            the masses.
            The proportionality constant, G, is both a function of the
            size of the
            universe, and the amount and location of other masses in the
            universe.
            In general, the constant, G, remains very much a constant,
            except when
            other masses are located relatively close and in line with
            the test masses.
            Since gravitational effects are a function of Euclidian
            geometry, and the
            rhysmonic universe is Euclidian in geometry, e.g., Euclidian
            "straight
            lines" do exist in the universe, shielding effects must be
            considered in
            any determination of the gravitational constant, G. In most
            determinations
            of G, neglect of this factor has resulted in errors in the
            determination
            of the value of G.</font>
        </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Two interesting
            observations can
            now be made. First, gravitation is basic to the matrix
            construction of
            the vacuum and thus is very fundamental as it does not
            depend on any other
            effect other than the "screening" action of masses in the
            universe. Thus,
            gravitation is really an "impelling" force rather than an
            "attractive"
            force between the masses. If the vacuum did not exist,
            neither would the
            phenomenon of gravitation, even if matter "existed" in a
            void. Second,
            since these gravitational effects take place in Planck time,
            T*, with instantaneous
            rhysmonic vectors existing in this time period, "action at a
            distance"
            is in effect restored in this universe. Electromagnetic
            effects, which
            proceed at the speed of light, C, do not play a part in this
            action. However,
            since gravitational fields are rhysmonic flux fields, the
            same as electric
            fields are also rhysmonic flux fields, both can transfer
            energy between
            distant objects in the process called induction, which
            really involves
            monopole "waves" between them. It must be remembered,
            however, that in
            the case of the electric field, the rhysmonic flux is due to
            the presence
            of charge in the universe, while with gravitation, the
            rhysmonic flux is
            due to the presence of shielding masses and charge is not a
            requirement.
            A commonly observed flux due to this shielding action is the
            earth’s gravity.</font>

        <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Gravity on Earth</font></b>

        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The gravitation due to the
            earth’s
            mass appears in the common concept of weight. The shielding
            action of the
            earth’s mass results in a net flux of rhysmonic impulses at
            the earth’s
            surface which becomes the accelerating force of gravity or
            the accelerating
            force of free fall, g. Newton’s law may be applied to this
            special case
            of gravitation using the best estimate of the earth’s radius
            and mass.
            The constant of proportionality is now g. the relation for
            the weight,
            W, is given by:</font>

        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">W = mg ,</font>

        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Where m is the mass of the
            test particle.
            The expression for W assumes that g is a constant, which
            normally it is.
            However, rhysmonic cosmology has shown that "fluctuations"
            in this constant
            could exist due to certain cosmological effects. Therefore,
            the apparent
            weight, W, would also fluctuate, sometimes quite
            appreciably, in the order
            of several per cent! Shown in
            <b><a href="#fig11">Figure (11)</a></b> are
            simplified depictions of two cosmological factors which are
            found to affect
            the value of g on earth. The shielding action of the mass of
            the earth
            results in a fairly uniform g-field flux at the surface of
            the earth (assuming
            locations selected for constant flux values). This is
            indicated by the
            uniform length vectors directed toward the center of the
            earth. Consider
            now a supernova explosion located far off in space at
            location,
            <u>A</u>.
            The oscillatory "implosion" of the mass of the core of this
            nova will "modulate"
            the instantaneous rhysmonic vectors and this will appear as
            a modulation
            superimposed on the g-field flux appearing to an observer
            located at location
            <u>a</u>
            on earth. In a similar manner, a dense object, such as the
            core of a galaxy
            or a black hole, located in deep space at position <u>B</u>,
            will reduce
            the g-field flux level to an observer located on earth at
            position
            <u>b</u>.
            The mechanisms and experimental data for these observations
            will be given

        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Quadrature-type
            gravitational-waves
            which propagate at the speed of light were predicted by
            Einstein many years
            ago. While rhysmonics does not deny such waves, the low
            levels and extremely
            long wavelengths of such waves makes their detection very
            difficult. Unequivocal
            detection of such waves has not been made to date (perhaps
            some micropulsations
            may be such waves). However, monopole-type induction field
            gravitational
            "waves", generated by oscillatory mass movements such as
            would appear in
            a supernova have been <u>unequivocally</u> detected
            electronically (3)
            with the very basic circuit shown in <b><a href="#fig12">Figure
                (12)</a></b>.
            This circuit operates essentially in that these oscillatory
            gravitational
            impulse signals appear equivalent to the action of an
            alternating electric
            field with respect to the loosely bound electrons in the
            detecting capacitor.
            The current impulses generated in this capacitor are highly
            amplified to
            a voltage pulse which is then displayed on a recording meter
            and/or oscilloscope
            as well as listened to on audio equipment. This circuit will
            actually display
            the gaussian amplitude variations of nova and supernova
            "bursts" as well
            as other gravitational disturbances in the universe. This
            circuit is further
            discussed in reference articles in Appendix III and will not
            be further
            considered here. Therefore, under certain conditions, the
            monopole gravitational
            "waves", or more correctly, rhysmonic impulse flux
            variations, cannot be
            differentiated from electric field flux variations since
            they are essentially
            the same entities. The detector is also useful in detecting
            massive bodies
            in the universe as a "shadow" affecting the average
            background levels of
            the general gravitational radiation. This technique has been
            used to detect
            galaxy structure, black holes, and more important, supernova
            development
            in real time! These concepts and experiments are also
            further discussed

        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The so-called microwave
            background
            radiation (MBR) has been attributed to being a relic
            radiation left over
            from the original "explosion" in the Big-bang version of the
            origin of
            the universe. However, it can be shown by rhysmonics to
            actually be due
            to a summation of all the above gravitational "waves"
            present in the universe.
            This radiation was discovered serendipitiously in 1965 by
            Penzias and Wilson
            (Ref. 4) in the course of making radio-astronomical
            measurements using
            a microwave horn antenna at about a 7 cm wavelength. During
            the course
            of these tests, a residual radiation which was isotropic in
            nature, remained
            unaccounted for. That this radiation is of a black body
            nature and highly
            isotropic has been determined in many tests since that time.
            Today the
            radiation has been shown to pretty much follow the curve for
            a black body
            at a temperature of about 2.7° K. However, some questions
            still remain
            concerning the isotropy of this radiation.</font>

        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The simple detection
            circuit of <b><a href="#fig12">Figure
                (12)</a></b>, when operated with stabilizing capacitor,
            C<sub>x</sub> ,
            in the circuit, will respond to overall noises generated by
            these gravitational
            impulse processes. This is depicted in the curve of <b><a
                href="#fig13">Figure
                (13)</a></b>. Audio amplification of the output of the
            detector will evidence
            the many sounds of space, both noisy and somewhat musical
            sounds. An interesting
            experiment can be performed under these audio conditions.
            The output of
            the detector can be modulated in amplitude by a local
            movement of mass
            near the detector. This is depicted as Experiment I in the
            simplified sketch
            of <b><a href="#fig14">Figure (14)</a>.</b> Here, the
            output level of the
            noise can be peaked or nulled with a mass movement of about
            0.25 cm between
            the peaks or nulls, for an apparent "space" wavelength of
            this 0.25 cm.
            It is as if the gravitational noise in space has a natural
            intense wavelength
            of 0.25 cm, and local perturbations cause these signals to
            interfere, typical
            of standing waves in wave theories. This effect is found to
            be present
            at all laboratory distances, up to the maximum of 75 feet
            available. The
            effect is not due to electromagnetic effects since when the
            circuit, amplifier
            and power supplies are shielded electrically thoroughly, the
            modulation
            still comes through unabated. In fact, the detector is found
            to be also
            modulated by the beating heart! It is also significant that
            the measured
            wavelength of 0.25 cm is also the peak wavelength of the
            so-called black
            body microwave radiation! However, as is shown here, this
            noise <u>is</u>
            a gravitational effect and a summation or integration of all
            rhysmonic
            impulses generated in the universe, and thus averaged out as
            a general
            noise background level. While this noise level, or if you
            wish, this microwave
            background level (what Penzias and Wilson measured was the
            microwave energy
            generated by the thermal heating of their horn antenna by
            these gravitational
            impulse signals) is quite isotropic, since it exists in a
            black body universe,
            measurable anisotropies will also exist due to our
            off-center location
            in this spherical universe, and the random nature of the
            supernova "bursts"
            as well as random concentrations of mass, i.e., galaxies, in
            the central
            portion of the universe. As a final note, while the
            gravitational flux
            field is equivalent to the electric flux field under certain
            conditions,
            it is not an electric flux field since it is not sources or
            sunk by an
            electric charge. Therefore, the so-called microwave
            background radiation
            is really a gravitational effect as discussed here.</font>

        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Consider now another
            effect which
            is also gravitational in nature. Suppose that a mass is set
            into physical
            oscillation by an external force in some direction, it does
            not matter
            which direction is chosen. The movement of the mass will
            affect the energy
            of the instantaneous rhysmonic vectors in the direction of
            this mass translation.
            If this energy increase is just unidirectional, the mass
            affected will
            continue to translate in this direction in the process of
            inertia as was
            discussed in Chapter 4. In essence, the component of
            increased energy is
            superimposed on the instantaneous rhysmonic vectors
            contained in this "straight
            line Euclidian" universe. When the motion is made
            oscillatory, this requires
            that the mass be accelerated and then decelerated to a halt,
            reaccelerated
            in the opposite direction and again decelerated to a halt
            again. While
            external energy is required to <u>initiate</u> this
            process, once initiated,
            the energy of the vacuum, i.e., the rhysmonic matrix
            structure, will maintain
            this oscillation until dissipated in some fashion. This is
            because a movement
            of mass interacts with rhysmonic vectors, and affected
            rhysmonic vectors,
            in turn, interact with mass. Thus, an oscillating mass, in
            principle, should
            initiate a gravitational disturbance in the vacuum which
            could be perpetuated
            forever by the intrinsic energy of the vacuum as was seen in
            the case of
            inertia and the propagation of electromagnetic fields.</font>
        </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">That this is so is
            confirmed in the
            simple test indicated as Experiment II in the simplified
            sketch of <b><a href="#fig14">Figure
                (14)</a></b>. Using the same totally shielded
            gravitational signal detector
            as before, slowly oscillate a mass (this cold be your arm,
            for example)
            at a slow rate around 1 cycle per second. Note that the
            audio output of
            thedetector responds with a "rushing" sound which reflects
            the disturbance
            your arm is creating in the 0.25 cm standing waves in the
            universe. Repeat
            this motion (adjusting the rate if necessary) until a
            well-defined "modulation
            of noise" is established. Then <u>cease</u> this
            perturbation by your arm
            at some peak swing and maintain your arm at rest in this
            position, i.e.,
            do not disturb the vacuum any further. You will now note
            that the modulations
            will continue on at this same rate for many more minutes
            (even hours if
            there are no other local disturbances), or until other
            perturbations in
            the universe destroy this coherent effect. A local effect
            which usually
            takes over is the beating of the observer’s own heart!</font>

        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The basic premises of
            rhysmonic cosmology
            have been used to develop a theory of gravitation which

            previously
            unknown gravitational effects. Gravitation is thus seen to
            be but another
            aspect of rhysmonic cosmology and rhysmonic impulse forces.
            In essence,
            gravitational fields, electric fields, and magnetic fields

        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">As was stated in the
            introduction
            to this brief monograph, it was the hope of cosmologists to
            ascertain a
            basic simplicity to nature and thus to unify the forces of
            nature, especially
            the electromagnetic and gravitational fields. This was
            achieved to some
            extent in the case of electric and magnetic fields, but the
            recent emphasis
            on a geometric explanation for gravitation had just about
            precluded the
            inclusion of the gravitational field in this unity. Einstein
            had spent
            many years in this quest without success.</font>
        </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">To a large measure,
            rhysmonic cosmology,
            thus far, has shown that electric and magnetic fields are
            but different
            manifestations of directed excess rhysmonic vectors. In the
            discussion
            of electromagnetism, it was shown that some dynamic
            translations of rhysmons
            would create an electric field due to the creation of
            regions of rhysmonic
            excesses and deficiencies. The resulting rhysmonic stress in
            the vacuum
            is the electric field. As a function of this rhysmonic
            movement, rhysmonics
            required an accompanying rotational movement of directed
            excess vectors,
            which manifested itself as the magnetic field. Thus, the two
            fields, which
            of necessity must be interrelated in the dynamic case, are
            but different
            aspects of directed rhysmonic vectors. This is only natural,
            as the universe
            only consists of rhysmons and the void. Similarly,
            gravitational fields
            were shown to be but yet another aspect of these vectors as
            was discussed
            in the last chapter. The unification of these three aspects
            is simply demonstrable
            using the simple circuit for gravitational "wave" signal
            detection which
            was shown in <b><a href="#fig12">Figure (12)</a></b>.</font>

            a localized
            excess of rhysmons, while negative charge is a localized
            region having
            a deficiency of rhysmons. Directed excess rhysmonic vectors

            vectors is achievable
            with the "shielding" action introduced by mass particles,
            with or without
            charge. The earth’s mass creates a relatively strong flux
            known more generally
            as the earth’s gravity. However, since all these fluxes are
            excess directed
            rhysmonic vectors, they are all the same entity, only the
            method of their
            creation makes them appear to be different. The equivalence

            through their
            effects on loosely bound electrons in a capacitor. The
            electrons are "moved"
            by gravitational impulses (rhysmons) created by the sharp
            probe movement
            in very much the same fashion that the electric field
            (rhysmons) created
            by the battery can "move" these electrons. It had been shown
            by the author
            (see references of Appendix III) that supernova should
            create relatively
            strong monopolar gravitational impulses, i.e., rhysmonic
            vector impulses,
            which are oscillatory in nature, and thus should appear to
            this capacitor
            as equivalent to an alternating electric field. The
            resulting perturbations
            on the loosely bound electrons creates small impulse
            currents which can
            be amplified tremendously and converted to voltage
            fluctuations in the

            Therefore, electric fields and gravitational fields, under
            certain conditions,
            are indistinguishable from each other (as demonstrated in

            depicted in <b><a href="#fig6">Figure
                (6)</a></b>, the universe is a perfect sphere, with
            matter formed only
            in central portion. The outer half-sphere is generally pure
            rhysmoid (pure
            vacuum) in construction. A fairly active galaxy could be
            viewed directly
            through the matter universe with a great loss of EM wave
            energy in this
            matter region, or also over a much longer path reflecting
            off the edge
            of the universe, with little or no loss of EM energy in the
            rhysmoid region.
            Therefore, this second path would introduce large redshifts
            but little
            energy loss, the two more prominent characteristics of

            much faster
            than in reality. This is a property of spherical mirrors and
            is simply
            demonstrable by looking at the image of an object, say a
            pencil point,

        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">As had been pointed out
            many times
            now, matter in the rhysmonic universe forms only in the
            central region
            of the universe. Coupled with rhysmonic gravitational
            effects, it can be
            shown that spiral formation in matter concentrations are a
            natural development
            in this universe. With the further development of matter
            from the intrinsic
            energy of the vacuum, other effects appear which tend to
            destroy this symmetry.
            For example, supernovae tend to form black holes with
            surrounding shock-ring-formed
            star systems. On a larger scale, the shock-ring star
            formations become
            new galaxy formations. Over a long period of time, the
            universe may tend
            to collect black holes in the center region, perhaps
            creating a super black
            hole, and a "chicken wire" structure of galaxies in the
            remainder of the
            matter portion of the universe. The original basic spiral
            structure may
            yet leave trace areas where galaxy count is low, i.e., the
            so-called holes
            in space. Gravitational wave astronomy should be able to
            "map" this structure
            more completely. More details on these processes are given

        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It has been shown in
            several reference
            articles that l/f noise is generated by massive
            gravitational effects,
            such as those created by nova and supernova bursts, the
            energy of which
            affect relatively free matter, such as molecules, atoms, and
            electrons.
            This noise is heard in such varied phenomena as running
            water; winds and
            fan-forced air; ionized flames, such as gas- and oil-fired
            burners; and
            even in the so-called "sounds of the sea" in sea shells.
            Electrons in electronic
            components such as resistors, capacitors, and electron
            devices, are especially
            sensitive to these fluctuations in the rhysmonic flux which
            bathes matter
            throughout the universe. Since the sources of these
            fluctuations are generally
            large volume, e.g., supernovae, the fluctuations in a
            particular locality
            are largely correlated. While other effects, such as signal
            delays in circuits,
            would tend to destroy some of this correlation, it is
            possible, in principle,
            to cancel noise generated by these processes at the input o
            an electronic
            system, where the noise factor is largely established.
            Cancellation would
            require the proper adjustment of both phase and amplitude if
            reduction
            is to be more complete. Such cancellation would enable the
            design of more
            sensitive receivers, for example, since at low audio
            frequencies, l/f noise,
            at present, is the limiting factor in receiver sensitivity.</font>

            which balance
            weights against some restoring force (Hooke’s Law type

        <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Vacuum Energy</font></b>
        </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Rhysmonic cosmology has
            shown the
            vacuum to be a storehouse of a vast amount of potential
            energy. In fact,
            this is the only real energy source in the universe. This
            energy is made
            apparent to man through the perturbation and disturbances in
            this storehouse,
            which will now appear as particles and fields, as well as
            other attending
            phenomena. Most energy sources used by man are secondary
            sources, in which
            this fundamental energy had been converted to other forms by
            other processes.
            Rhysmonics does not preclude the "tapping" of the vacuum
            energy more directly,
            e.g., through an intermediate process which can be
            controlled by man. Nuclear
            energy is a point in fact, as in the gravitational impulse
            energy which
            can be tapped with the use of capacitors, for example. There
            are other
            ways to tap this vacuum energy; these become more and more
            apparent as
            the understanding of rhysmonic cosmology develops. The most
            promising is
            the extraction of energy from the curl of a magnetic field,
            which can be
            directly replaced by the intrinsic energy of the vacuum.
            Preliminary tests
            have shown that such a system could probably be the energy
            source of the
            future because of its extreme efficiency.</font>

              Communications</font></b>
        </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Very limited work on this
            aspect
            has demonstrated feasibility. This is a most important
            consideration for,
            say space communication, since communication would be
            instantaneous. If
            there are other intelligent life out there in space,
            monopole gravitational
            waves would probably be used for space signaling. Some of
            the sounds heard
            on GW detectors, especially the "musical" ones might be such
            communications,
            especially as they appear to come from the same direction in
            space on a
            daily basis. Most are from the plane of the Milky Way. This
            development
            is the direct result of the discovery of monopole gravity
            signals, and
            the author is confident that future developments will make
            this a viable
            and reliable communications system.</font>

        <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Conclusions</font></b>
        </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The technological
            applications applications
            of rhysmonic cosmology are extremely numerous since this is
            quite virgin
            territory yet. The author has prepared many patent
            applications covering
            the basic and specific technology of this cosmology. The
            author, at present,
            has over 100 potential applications for this technology.
            However, other
            than that already disclosed here, the remainder will be
            disclosed in future
            articles after patent protection has been sought.</font>

        </center>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The prime objective of
            this brief
            monograph was to introduce the principles of rhysmonic
            cosmology to potential
            fellow investigators in a simple and straightforward manner.
            To do this
            properly would have required much more time and many more
            pages than the
            author could do a this time.</font>
        </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The author, however, hopes
            that he
            has provided enough glimpses of this theory to encourage
            others to enter
            into this development. Some additional considerations are
            provided in the
            specialized articles listed in the rhsymonic references of
            Appendix III.
            Technological aspects, however, are first disclosed in
            patent applications,
            and then in limited form here and also in technical articles
            in the future.</font>
        </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Rhysmonic cosmology, which
            has strong
            experimental and theoretical support, has every indication
            of being the
            viable cosmology of the future. Rhysmonics is here to stay.</font>
