        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The rhysmoid is formed of
            many individual
            rhysmons which are interlocked as a matrix-type structure in
            a 3-dimensional
            configuration. It is difficult to visualize this active
            structure except
            in an "instant" of time, where the rhysmon's position can be
            considered
            to be momentarily "frozen" in time. Consider a single
            rhysmon in a planar
            "orbit" as depicted in Figure 1. This rhysmon is depicted in
            six momentary
            positions, separated in time at each position by the Panck
            Time, T*, of
            about 5.4 x 10<sup>-44</sup> seconds. At each of these
            "instants" in time,
            the rhysmonic vector may be considered as a "force" directed
            tangentially
            to the radius of the orbit path at that particular
            instantaneous position.
            It should be remembered that when the entire rhysmonic
            matrix structure
            is considered, each of the instantaneous rhysmon positions
            shown in Figure
            1 would actually be occupied by a different <u>separate</u>
            individual
            rhysmon of the matrix structure. Therefore, the
            instantaneous forces as
            depicted there would construct the typical <u>hexagonal</u>
            force structure
            normally depicted in this rhysmonic cosmology. When the
            other rhysmons
            in an extended volume are also considered, the forces
            present in each of
            the unit cell structures will "intermesh" with the other
            cell structures
            and thus will build-up to make the rhysmoid, i.e., the
            vacuum substratum,
            or aether, of this universe.</font></p>

      <blockquote><font face="Times New Roman,Times">As depicted in
          Figure 1,
          the dynamic energy vectors of each individual rhysmon will be
          directed
          in <u>all</u> possible directions in the plane of their
          orbits as a function
          of each instantaneous time period, but each individual rhysmon
          will return
          to its original vector direction after a time period of 6T*.
          Moreover,
          in the case of the 3-dimensional configuration of a basic
          matrix cell structure,
          as shown in Figure in the Monograph <i>Rhysmonic Cosmology</i>
          for a particular
          instant of time, the dynamic energy vectors will be directed
          over <u>every</u>
          conceivable possible direction in space during the course of
          the instantaneous
          positions of each individual rhysmon in that same time period
          of 6T*. These
          impulse forces in space will thus be a function of and related
          to Planck's
          Constant, h.</font></blockquote>

      <blockquote><font face="Times New Roman,Times">For an extended
          planar rhysmonic
          structure, or an extended 3-dimensional rhysmonic structure,
          the rhysmonic
          energy vectors will also "interlock" to form universe-wide
          similarly directed
          (when not disturbed) energy vectors in the universe. These,
          when aligned,
          will be those instantaneous straight-line Euclidian-type
          vectors in free
          space which are fundamental to the phenomena of gravity.
          However, any changes
          in the energy density for the rhysmonic matrix structure will
          introduce
          what will now be recognized as mass (matter) and fields
          (forces) by man
          and his instrumentation. However, the undisturbed rhysmoid
          would be "unobservable"
          since it exists as a perfectly balanced energy system where
          all vectors
          are "cancelled" and thus can present no outward effects.</font></blockquote>

          thus that
          aspect will not be extensively considered here. It is
          difficult enough
          to describe the rhysmoid (or aether) without introducing more
          questions
          right now. Perhaps, the rhysmon may be a universe in itself,
          and out Universe
          might be a rhysmon of an even larger universe, and so on ad
          infinitum in
          both direction. Such a system of universes has been suggested
          in the past.</font></blockquote>

          is a
          dynamic theory which, when fully developed, might go a long
          way in explaining
          reality at both the macroscopic (chemical and astronomical)
          levels, as
          well as the microscopic (atomic and sub-quantum) levels. It
          appears to
          be having some success thus far even in its early stages of
          development.
