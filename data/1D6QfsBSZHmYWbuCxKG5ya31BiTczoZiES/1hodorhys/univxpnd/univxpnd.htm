      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The expansion of the
          universe has
          been invoked from the ‘Big Bang’ theory of the creation of the
          universe
          and as the only logical explanation for the redshifts observed
          in the spectra
          from distant galaxies. The author, however, utilizing a ‘new’
          cosmology
          developed by him, shows that redshifts are but a necessary
          consequence
          of the process of EM wave propagation and that the universe
          must be finite
          and spherical. Therefore, the universe is not really
          expanding!</font>

      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Introduction</font></b>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The vastness of our universe
          was
          not realized until about 1919 when a study of novae in
          so-called ‘spiral
          nebulae’ were found to be, on the average, at least 100 times
          further away
          as those which appeared at times in our own galaxy. Therefore,
          these objects
          were found to be ‘extra-galactic’, and the universe received
          an enormous
          extension in space. Determination of a velocity of approach or
          recession
          for these extra-galactic nebulae, i.e., galaxies, indicated
          that practically
          all galaxies were receding from us. This was culminated, in
          1929, by the
          announcement by E.P. Hubble, that the velocity of recession
          was proportional
          to the galaxy distance, e.g., galaxies at a distance of d
          million light
          years, have velocities of about 100d miles per second. Present
          day cosmologists
          postulate an expansion of the universe primarily because of
          the Hubble
          relation, This enabled an explanation for the ‘redshifts’ in
          the spectra
          of distant galaxies in terms of a Doppler Shift effect (which
          would be
          proportional to the velocity of recession). No other ‘effect’
          was known
          which could explain this without further ad hoc assumptions.</font>
      </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Hubble Constant</font></b>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In general, the velocity of
          recession
          of a galaxy at a distance d, is given by:</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">V = H<sub>o</sub> d ,</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Where H<sub>o</sub> is a
          constant
          of proportionality called the Hubble Constant. Since this
          factor is determined
          from experimental observations and certain assumptions, it is
          uncertain
          and thus has changed value many times over the years. The
          constant has
          a value ranging from about 50 to 100 km/sec per megaparsec.
          The presently
          accepted value is 55, but recent work indicates 75 may be more
          correct.
          The current value of 55 will be used in the following
          illustrations for
          this constant. Therefore, the present day calculated Hubble
          factor is H<sub>o</sub><u>~</u>
          5.9 x 10<sup>-29</sup> per centimeter of light travel time.
          Since light
          (in vacuum) travels at 2.977 x 10<sup>10</sup> cm/sec, it will
          have a travel
          time, to, of 3.36 x 10-11 sec for the one centimeter length.
          Therefore,
          this equation can be re-expressed as follows:</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">V = H<sub>o</sub> / t<sub>o</sub><u>~</u>
          5.9 x 10<sup>-29</sup> / 3.36 x 10<sup>-11</sup> sec <u>~</u>
          1.76 x 10<sup>-18</sup>
          sec<sup>-1</sup> .</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Thus, for a galaxy at a
          distance,
          d, say one million light years, which is 10<sup>6</sup> LY x
          9.46 x 10<sup>17
          </sup>cm/LY
          or 9.46 x 10<sup>23</sup> cm away, the velocity is:</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">V = H<sub>t</sub>d = 1.76 x
          10<sup>-18</sup>
          / sec x 9.46 x 10<sup>23</sup> cm</font>
        <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">= 1.67 x 10<sup>6</sup>
          cm/sec,
          or about 10.4 miles/sec.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Therefore, the original
          Hubble factor
          was about 10 times too high! The present Hubble factor may be
          a factor
          of 2 or 3 too low now?</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">However, the author has
          developed
          a ‘new’ cosmology in which an alternate explanation is given
          for the observed
          redshift in the spectra of distant galaxies (Ref. 1). This
          cosmology enabled
          a new approach to the basis of electromagnetic wave
          propagation (Ref. 2).
          In essence, it restores an updated version of an ‘aether’ as
          the constituent
          of the vacuum. A substratum particle which he termed the
          rhysmon, after
          another early Greek term for the atom, forms the very fabric
          of the universe
          and is the basis of this rhysmonic cosmology. Some concepts,
          essential
          to any discussion of the EM wave propagation process, will be
          briefly presented
          here. Further details will be found in the reference cited
          above.</font>
      </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Basic Rhysmonics</font></b>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The substratum, or the new
          arther
          of the vacuum, is a storehouse of potential energy provided by
          the extremely
          small spherical objects called the rhysmons. The rhysmons are
          contained
          within individual ‘orbits’ and have energy equal to one Planck
          Constant
          quantum of action, h. Individual rhysmons intertwine with
          other rhysmons
          in a matrix structure as shown in <b><a href="#fig5">Figure
              (1)</a></b>.
          In this planar view it is seen that interweaving results in
          short directed
          rhysmonic vectors which now have energies of h/2 pi, or h
          quantum of action.
          From this construction, one can define some additional
          parameters based
          upon Planck’s Constant and his system of natural Units (Ref
          3). These are
          given in Appendix I for reference. The complete matrix is
          shown in 3-dimensional
          form in <b><a href="#fig6">Figure (2)</a></b>. This basic
          cell is reminiscent
          of R. Buckminster Fuller’s vector equilibrium (Ref 4) in that
          all directed
          energy vectors in the pure rhysmoid, i.e., the undisturbed
          vacuum, cancel
          their energies and thus display no effects or phenomena which
          can be ‘observable’.
          The basic cell structures interlock with other cells to form
          the vacuum
          of the universe. This interlocking is depicted for an extended
          planar view
          in <b><a href="#fig7">Figure (3)</a></b>. Maximum use of
          energy content
          requires that the 3-dimensional universe be in spherical form.
          Shown in
          <b><a href="#fig7">Figure
              (3)</a></b> are the directed energy vectors as given in a
          single instant
          of time as given by the Planck Time, T*. In the next instant
          of time, T*,
          all the vectors reverse direction, and then restore to the
          original direction
          in time, T*, later. Thus the universe is like a movie, in
          which each frame
          in the cinema of existence lasts for only Planck Time, T*. As
          seen in <b><a href="#fig7">Figure
              (3)</a></b>, directed vectors join head-to-tail to form an
          ‘instantaneous’
          vector which can span the universe. The instantaneous vectors
          are especially
          significant in the rhysmonic explanation of the nature of
          gravitation.
          However, the interaction of these vectors in the process of EM
          wave propagation
          must be discussed briefly here as they are essential to a
          discussion of
          the redshift mechanism. This simple interpretation of the
          structure of
          the universe forms the basis of rhysmonics.</font>

          which is equal

          component in electromagnetic
          wave propagation is at right angles to the direction of the

          and since curl or a rotational vector geometry is involved,

          reversal cannot take place closer than this closest approach
          of parallel
          vectors, or 2L*. It can be shown that a similar requirement is
          needed for
          the electric field (curl) vectors (see References). Therefore,
          for each
          magnetic field (or electric field reversal), i.e., for each
          half wavelength
          of electromagnetic wave propagation, the wavelength must

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Rhysmonic cosmology
          predicted that
          electromagnetic wave propagation would require about a 2L*
          (double Planck
          Length) increase in wavelength with each half wavelength of EM
          wave propagation.
          For the full wavelength the increase would be in the order of
          4L*, due
          to the nature of the propagation process in this theory. The
          process has
          been depicted in <b><a href="#fig8">Figure (4)</a></b> for
          the magnetic
          component only. Therefore, this mechanism results in increased
          wavelength
          for EM waves as a function of the time (or length of path) of
          the progation.
          Thus, the redshifts in the spectra of distant optical
          phenomena are part
          of this propagation process, and not the result of an
          expanding universe.</font>

          factor, H*,
          as determined by rhsymonic cosmology, is fundamentally more
          accurate, and
          thus may be used to calculate astronomical distances without
          the uncertainties
          of the present Hubble factor. The wavelength-distance relation
