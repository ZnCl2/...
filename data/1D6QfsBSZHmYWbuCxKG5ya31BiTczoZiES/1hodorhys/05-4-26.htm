<p><b>A. Rhysmonic Geometric Concepts</b>
<p>Many concepts in Rhysmonics have been released to you over the years
in papers, articles, notes, experiments and personal communications. Briefly,
the methods of Euclid were used in this cosmology and they are effective
universe-wide! Some basic postulates are now defined as they apply to an
undisturbed Euclidian Universe.
<p>1. <i>Point</i>: A point in rhysmonics is defined as a finite but extremely
small particle: It is the rhysmon itself!
<p>2. <i>Line</i>: The line is defined as a series of points (rhysmons)
where adjacent points lie in the shadows of each other. When all points
lie with a common shadow, this is generally termed as a straight line and
now it can exist universe-wide!
<p>3. <i>Plane</i>: A plane may be defined as a collection of points (rhysmons)
in which parallel lines can exist. Parallel lines are defined as adjacent
straight lines which maintain a specified spacing universe-wide!
<p>4. <i>Volume</i>: A volume is defined as a region in space where a collection
of points (rhysmons) can exist as a series of adjacent planes which maintain
a specified spacing universe-wide! A region which exists universe-wide
is just the volume of a finite Universe!
<p><b>B. Mensural Concepts</b>
<p>Measuring concepts in rhysmonics are based upon Planck’s Natural Units
(and their derivatives) as well as on the Cartesian coordinate reference
system, since a Euclidean Universe is best described by such a measuring
system. Some other applicable postulates are now defined.
<p>1. <i>Point</i>: The point (rhysmon) has only location (position), shape
(sphere), and a quality called inertia (mass). These are discussed in my
Monograph and in the many other releases to you. Location (position) here
is in relation to the rest of the Universe, since the point (rhysmon) is
essentially fixed in the structure of a rhysmonic universe.
<p>2. <i>Line</i>: The line is further defined by a concept called length,
which is esentially a physical distance between any two points on a line.
In rhysmonics the basic unit of length is the Panck Length, L*. This is
the closest spacing between any two adjacent points in an undisturbed universe.
All other lengths are simply multiples of that unit length, i.e., L = nL*,
where n is the number of adjacent points (rhysmons) in that line.
<p>3. <i>Plane</i>: A plane in Cartesian coordinates is generally measured
in straight line lengths in the X-direction and also the Y-direction. The
product of these lengths give rise to a concept called area, A. In this
case the area is termed a square and it is related to the number of rhysmons
in that two-dimensional space. Other arithmetical or geometrical methods
of measurement are used for other area shapes.
<p>4. <i>Volume</i>: In a similar fashion, the concept of a volume is simply
a measurement of the number of points (rhysmons) in three-dimensional space.
The simplest volume measurement is the cube, where the x, y, and z lengths
are equal. The volume is simply the product XYZ! Other arithmetical or
geometrical methods are used tocompute the volume of other shaped regions.
<p><b>C. Summary</b>
<p>The point (rhysmon) is an entity which has a fundamental existence in
itself. Thus, geometrically, it has only a location, as such, in the Universe.
However, since it is a very dynamic entity (at Planck lengths) it is the
sole source of energy in the Universe! Dynamic energy in the third-dimension
universe is kinetic energy and is measured as 1/2 MV<sup>2</sup> (since
an averaged velocity must be used). However, the rhysmonic kinetic energy
is equal to MC<sup>2</sup>, since the rhysmonic velocity is equal to C,
the constant velocity of light! See my releases for more details on this.
The line not only has a location in the Universe but also a characteristic
called length. Moreover, the line (especially straight lines), enable the
transport of rhysmonic energy throughout the Universe! The plane not only
has location in the Universe, but also the characteristic called area.
Moreover, this planar area enables a larger flux of energy to be transported
throughout the Universe. A volume not only has location in the Universe,
but the characteristic of being a region in space, which now enables an
energy density characteristic to exist in space.
<p>All the above characteristics of a Rhysmonic Universe have been used
in the many experimental and theoretical proofs I used over the years to
demonstrate the real existence of such a Rhysmonic Universe! At the present
time it appears that Euclidian Geometry describes the undisturbed Universe
quite well and that there is no need for the other two proposed theoretical
geometries!
<p><b>D. Conclusions</b>
<p>1. Euclidian geometrical methods strictly apply only to an undisturbed
Universe. However, the rhysmonic universe is extremely dynamic with energy
available from the linear (G-fields) in the Universe and also from the
rotational (torsion fields) in the Universe. This essentially unlimited
energy is available for use in many ways (transformed) but it is eventually
returned back to the Universe. Thus, the premise of the conservation of
energy: Energy is neither created or destroyed; it just exists. When external
forces and/or rhysmonic packing conditions apply, the disturbed Universe
will result in the many observed structures and activities seen in our
3-D everyday universe.
