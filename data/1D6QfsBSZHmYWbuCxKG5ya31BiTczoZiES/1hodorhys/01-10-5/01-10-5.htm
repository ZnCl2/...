      <p class="MsoNormal"><b>I. Gravitational Signal Astronomy Remarks</b>
      </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">As some of you now know, I have been using
        Rhysmonic
        techniques in astronomical observations since about 1970 --
        early in the
        development of my Rhysmonic Cosmology. Some thoughts on this
        appeared in
        a three-part paper that was highly edited but published as
        "Gravity Impulses"
        in the Radio Electronics <i>Experimenters’ Handbook</i> (1989).
        Much more
        appeared as well in many other Notes and papers released by me
        in the past.
      </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">This particular Note, however, is inspired by
        a paper
        by Don Reed, "Torsion Field Research and Implications for New
        Physics and
        Energy Technologies" as published in the <i>Journal of New
          Energy</i>,
        Vol. 4, No. 2 (1999). By the way, an edited version of my
        Cosmology Note
        of 10-20-98, "Extraction of Energy Directly from the Aether"
        also appeared
        in that same issue of JNE in a paper published by Bill Ramsay,
        "New Energy
        and Hodowanec’s Rhysmonic Cosmology".
      </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">Returning to Don Reed’s paper, I was
        impressed by
        the reference to "torsion field" astronomy telescope experiments
        made by
        N. Kozyrev (with V.V. Nasonov) where torsion fields (G-fields?)
        were used
        to "observe" the gravitational position of stars as being <u>displaced</u>
        from the optical image of the star -- implying much different
        "propagation"
        rates the "torsion field" and the EM (optical) fields (almost
        "instantaneous"
        for torsion fields!). This is definitely in agreement with my
        Rhysmonic
        Cosmology. I will elaborate more:
      </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">The Kozyrev system used small resistors in a
        balanced-bridge
        configuration, where the "sensing" resistor was located behind a
        slit that
        was also placed in the optical path of the telescope. The small
        changes
        in resistance of the sensing resistor (or the impulse currents
        developed
        in that resistor?) are caused by gravitational effects and would
        result
        in small voltage changes in the bridge network. This voltage was
        amplified
        and then measured by some device (meter, scope, chart recorder,
        etc.) <u>Many</u>
        materials and devices respond to gravitational impulses (torsion
        fields?).
        I used a small resistor as the sensing element in a version of
        my GW field
        detectors (as noted in the R.E. article above). But now let’s
        look at Figure
        (1):

        <u>many</u>
        reflections occur! Also, for ease in depiction, a planar

    <div class="MsoNormal">
      <blockquote>Figure (1) is a simplified depiction of how Kozyrev
        may have
        observed stars gravitationally. There I use our Sun as the star.
        Kozyrev
        observed that when his system was optically aligned with the
        star, a weak
        response was seen (even when optically shielded). If, however,
        he moved
        the telescope slightly to one side of the optical image (<u>East</u>
        or
        <u>West</u>?),
        he noticed a much <u>increased</u> response! He reasoned that
        this type
        of response could be due to the fact that the gravitational
        (torsion field?)
        "propagation" must be <u>many</u> orders of magnitude
        <u>faster</u> compared
        to the <u>slower</u> EM field <u>weak</u> response of the
        optical image.
        Thus the gravitational image response would "appear" before the
        optical
        image response. Moreover, he also noted a similar response when
        the telescope
        was "panned" equally to the other side of the optical image! He
        had no
        explanation for this other than to say that this was a "future"
        position
        of the star. In Figure (1) I give the Rhysmonic explanation.</blockquote>
    </div>
    <div class="MsoNormal">
      <blockquote>Rhysmonics postulates the Universe to be Euclidian in
        geometry
        and spherical in form and also to perfectly reflect all forms of
        radiant
        energy from the Universe edge. I believe the Earth to be located
        in a position
        somewhat inside the outer edge of the central "material" portion
        of the
        Universe (See my Rhysmonic Cosmology for more details). Using
        this as a
        basis, the simplified <u>planar</u> sketch of Figure (1)
        explains his result.
        The Earth is shown as located at position E. Any gravitational
        impulse
        directed through the Earth <u>and</u> the Universe Center would
        reflect
        just directly back on itself and thus tend to cancel. However,
        any <u>active</u>
        gravitational impulse that does <u>not</u> line up with the
        Universe <u>center</u>
        will result in repeated reflections of the edge of the Universe
        as depicted
        in Figure (1). For example, in this depiction, when the Sun is
        in its <u>actual</u>
        position, T<sub>1</sub> (gravitational path E-T<sub>1</sub>),
        the Sun’s
        gravitational effects will "bounce" off the Universe edge 30
        times before
        returning "instantly" to this same path and thus would be noted
        as an "additive"
        response in the system. But notice that a <u>reflection</u>
        point also
        appears at gravitational path E-T<sub>2</sub> equidistant from
        the Sun’s
        apparent position also! This could well be the other torsion (?)
        image
        appearing in Kozyrev’s test?</blockquote>

    <div class="MsoNormal">
      <blockquote><b>II. Conclusions ~</b></blockquote>
    </div>
    <div class="MsoNormal">
      <blockquote>1. While the gravitational impulses from our Sun would
        <u>precede</u>
        the optical image by about 8.3 minutes, the angle
        <strike>O</strike> would
        be extremely small and possibly not measurable here on Earth.
        While I do
        not know on which star Kozyrev conducted his tests, it probably
        was quite
        distant for him to obtain a measurable angle
        <strike>O</strike>.</blockquote>
    </div>
    <div class="MsoNormal">
      <blockquote>2. Repeating gravitational phenomena have appeared
        throughout
        my many tests in Rhysmonics and had been reported to you in many
        Notes
        and articles (both published and unpublished)! That phenomenon
        is fundamental
        in Rhysmonic Cosmology. Such phenomena (in integrated form) may
        be the
        basis of the Microwave background Radiation in the Universe. It
        can, however,
        be resolved into l/f and white noise components. I look at these
        components
        as the <u>zero-point energy</u> under consideration today. Of
        more importance,
        however, is the basic Rhysmonic G-field energy, which is really
        the
        <u>sole</u>
        intrinsic energy source of the Universe!</blockquote>
    </div>
    <div class="MsoNormal">
      <blockquote>3. Much of the repeating gravitational phenomena
        involve the
        rotation of the Earth, especially with regard to the g-fields of
        the Earth.
        One example is to "modulate" the g-fields by moving a mass, say
        at 100
        Hz every 10 seconds. Do this for a minute or so. Due to the
        Earth’s rotation,
        these impulses will then <u>repeat</u> (based on the above
        depiction) every
        10 seconds for may hours (at that location), even days, or until
        other
        Universe events finally dissipate (or mask) that energy.</blockquote>
    </div>
    <div class="MsoNormal">
      <blockquote>While simple GW detectors will illustrate the above
        effects,
        more elaborate GW detectors ("tuned" to the musical scale) will
        <u>repeat</u>
        simple musical tunes (as per Bill Ramsay’s Cosmic Organ)! Again,
        this will
        repeat for many hours after the "activation" of the simple tune
        had ceased!</blockquote>
    </div>
    <blockquote>
      <div class="MsoNormal">4. More effort is required (by others) to
        explore
        and utilize these simple techniques! How about you, my
        colleagues?</div>
