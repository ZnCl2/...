<br><font face="Times New Roman,Times">QND-type gravity detectors which
"ring" around 500-600 Hz at the input are ideal for detecting the actual
formation of the neutron star or black hole in the super-nova-type astronomical
event. These will appear as gaussian-type pulses when displayed on an oscilloscope.
However, nova and supernova, as well as the resulting black hole type structures
which appear following the supernova events, are best displayed with the
l/f type "shadow" gravity detectors, where the output is integrated to
obtain an envelope-type response for the event. Simple explanations for
these types of responses follow:</font></blockquote>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;" class="MsoNormal">
<blockquote><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Novae are stars which "explode"
and thus eject some of their outer layers and most of their atmosphere.
This is a momentary and transitory type of event which must be "caught
in the act", so to speak, since they do not ordinarily leave permanent
traces which may be "observable" with this system in further scans of that
region. The novae generally have two characteristic "signatures" when detected
with shadow-type detection systems. These are depicted in Figure (1). As
the extremely fine resolution "beam" of the detector scans a nova event
(as a function of the rotation of the earth), it will first detect the
actual explosion, primarily as a sharp gradient in the earth's gravity
field, due to the "modulation" of the earth gravity field by the sudden
displacement of a large amount of mass at the nova event. As the "beam"
moves with the earth rotation, it will pull away from that expanding mass
in the nova event and thus the response will fall off, or tail, as shown
in the depiction of Figure (1). In some cases, some shock-wave modulations
may appear, if the exploding star was in or near a gassy or dusty environment.
Nova events apparently occur quite often and thus are also "seen" quite
often with this detection system.</font></blockquote>

Responses</font></b></blockquote>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;" class="MsoNormal">
<blockquote><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Supernovae are believed
to be the demise of some more massive stars and thus are less frequent
events than supernovae, but still are "seen" fairly often with the shadow
detection systems. This is primarily due to the fact that supernovae are
detectable when located <u>anywhere</u> on the detector’s meridian location,
but generally in the zenith regions or directly through the earth. However,
the detections can be limited to certain depths in space by properly adjusting
the output signal integration, i.e., the output filter of the detection
circuitry.</font></blockquote>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;" class="MsoNormal">
<blockquote><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Supernovae responses as
detected with this system generally have three characteristic signatures
as is depicted in <b>Figure (2)</b>. Initially "seen" is the collapse of
the star to a neutron star or black hole. While this is noted as a gaussian-type
"ring" in the QND type of detectors, in the shadow type detectors it appears
as a very sudden change in averaged earth gravity levels, due both to the
movement of much mass in the supernova event as well as its compaction
(implosion) into the neutron star or black hole. This is followed immediately
by the explosive burst of much of the star's outer layers and atmosphere.
Since much mass is involved in this process (with high velocity movements),
the shock-wave front from the core event will "pile up" some surrounding
material as a ring (or rings) of debris which are also generally detectable
with these systems. Again, due to the rotation of the earth, a "tailing"
effect is also present. An additional characteristic response for supernovae
is that they <u>do</u> generally leave some lasting traces of their existence,
primarily the black holes and an "accretion" ring.</font></blockquote>

<blockquote><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A new black hole usually
retains an accretion ring structure and the characteristic "signatures"
are as depicted in <b>Figure (3)</b>. They can be quite pronounced in the
first few days following the supernova event. Here, the fine resolution
scanning "beam" of the detector can sweep across the entire structure of
the black hole and accretion ring as shown in <b>Figure (3)</b>. The black
holes and accretion rings have very long lifetimes, but the detection system
may also pick up black holes <u>without</u> the accretion ring. These may
be very old supernovae events which have since "lost" such structures in
an in-fall type of mechanism. Our own galaxy Center now has a new and very
pronounced "black hole" structure since about December 6, 1986!</font></blockquote>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;" class="MsoNormal">
<blockquote><font face="Times New Roman,Times">These simple explanations
of some prominent "observable" events in gravitational astronomy should
be of interest to the inquisitive experimenter, as well as amateur astronomers.
It should also be of prime interest to the professional astrophysicists
once they are able to shed their "inhibitions" due to their academic training.</font>
