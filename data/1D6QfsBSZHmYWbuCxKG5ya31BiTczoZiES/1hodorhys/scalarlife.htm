<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There has always been a question as to the possible
effects of a strong scalar-type field, e.g., the Tesla field, on living
organisms. On a smaller scale, it has been shown that scalar-type magnetic
fields did affect the lifetimes of small organisms (Ref. 1). Such scalar
magnetic fields are present at the pole pieces of magnets. Small organisms
which were living on top of a south magnetic pole piece were shown to have
reduced lifetimes compared to organisms which were living on top of a north
magnetic pole piece. Interaction between the scalar magnetic field and
the earth’s gravity field could result in a reduced gravity field on top
of the north magnetic pole and an increased gravity field on top of the
south magnetic pole. Gravity fields are thus increased when scalar flux
is directed in the same direction as the gravity field, and reduced when
the flux is directed in the opposite direction. The lifeforms, therefore,
appeared to prosper more under the reduced gravity field conditions. Perhaps
that is why small lifeforms are rather rare at the earth’s north pole region
(actually a south pole magnet), but appear to be much more abundant at
the earth’s south pole region (actually a north magnetic pole).
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What would have been the effect of the very strong
longitudinal scalar Tesla fields on humans if the power levels Tesla had
under consideration in his power transmisson system had ever become operational?
The answer to this question is that the humans ad all earthly lifeforms
had always existed in a very strong scalar-type field, the gravity field
of the earth, and to a lesser extent some strong scalar-type electrical
fields as well. The gravitational field near the earth’s surface has an
energy content of better than 400 KW-hours per cubic foot according to
the Russian physicist Landau. That this may be so is seen in the ‘extraction’
of this energy by means of the falling water at hydroelectric plants! The
only effect humans notice from this gravitational flux gradient is that
they also experience an acceleration towards the earth, better known as
their weight! He more massive the human is, of course, the greater is the
effect, and the effect can be quite dangerous if an unchecked acceleration
is suddenly checked by another mass at rest!
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the Tesla field may also be a form of scalar
field similar to the gravitational field, there may be only effects such
as the change in weight of a person located in such a field. However, if
a person were located in a vector-type field, e.g., an electromagnetic&nbsp;
(EM) field, having the same energy content as seen in the gravity field,
that person would probably be badly burned or even vaporized, since the
human body would possibly absorb much of the energy in a heating process,
very much the same as is seen in the microwave ovens of today. Fortunately,
it is difficult to develop such EM energy densities, except in drastic
processes such as an atomic bomb.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus, scalar-type fields, while containing much energy
content, react differently with material bodies, accelerating the bodies
rather than heating the bodies, Therefore, the energy system proposed by
Tesla could have become a viable system provided the system removed all
vestiges of EM radiation in the process. Tesla’s early tests did not do
so, so that there could have been problems in his proposed further tests.
However, further research could have developed the necessary methodology
for the safe introduction of such wireless power transmission systems.
That day may yet come!
