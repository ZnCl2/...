      </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">There are many interpretations for the
        gravitational
        constant, G, the value of which is presently determined largely
        from various
        experimental tests. I have shown in some past Notes that this
        value was
        also determinable from dimensional analysis using the Planck
        Natural Units.
        However, it intrigued me to know just what this constant really
        stood for.
        I knew that it was related to the 'force' of gravity in terms of
        Rhysmonic
        Cosmology, but past attempts to evaluate it always resulted in
        some extra
        terms in mass, length, or time. In some analyses these extra
        terms showed
        up as an acceleration, cm/sec2, or as a surface density, gm/cm2.
        I finally
        realized that both these relations could be directly obtained
        from the
        dimensional analysis of the units of the value of G!

      <p class="MsoNormal">this being the same value obtained in
        experiment AND
        this rhysmonic determination! Therefore, G may be a measure of
        the acceleration
        of rhysmonic flux through a unit area, something like the
        Poynting Vector
        in EM work. However, this measure may also be expressed as a
        surface force
        or a pressure gradient as follows:
      </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">P* = S* a* = about 4.64E114 dynes/cm**2
      </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><b>II. Some comments on this interpretation
          of G</b>
      </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">1. Rhysmonics implies that there is a very
        dynamic
        but highly localized structure in the rhysmoid (aether) which
        exists in
        the order of Planck Length dimensions in the 4th Dimension.
        Thus, when
        I speak about rhysmonic 'flux flow,' I do not imply a movement
        of rhysmons
        over any extended lengths, which we do in the third dimension
        where flux
        flow usually means an actual movement of particles, both
        microscopic and
        macroscopic. Both result in a pressure per unit area, but in
        rhysmonics
        only the effect is transported over space, very much like sound
        waves or
        water waves are transported and where there is little relative
        movement
        of the air or water molecules. Another difference here is that
        the rhysmonic
        effects are 'transported' essentially in an instantaneous
        fashion as pointed
        out in my Cosmology.
      </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">2. The universal gravitational 'flux' energy
        vectors
        are omni-directional in free 'undisturbed' space but due to the
        rhysmonic
        structure of space these vectors cancel and thus no 3rd
        dimensional effects
        are seen. Moreover, these energetic basic 4th dimensional
        vectors cannot
        be 'tapped' directly with most present day technology
        techniques. However,
        it is possible to 'tap' the energy in certain other existing
        scalar gradients
        in this field (or those which can be created with the use of
        certain field
        modifying techniques). The main gradients are well known:
        E-fields, H-fields,
        EM-fields, and g-fields. There may be many other field gradients
        which
        contain much energy, but most of these are as yet 'unknown' and
        must be
        'discovered' before man can use them as an energy source. There
        are already
        hints of these in some 'free energy' experiments and energy
        'machines.'
      </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">3. Much of the potential energy of the
        universal gravitational
        field has been 'captured' in particles and various radiation
        fields, and
        these provide much of our present day useful energy using the
        technology
        of today. However, as we learn more about our rhysmoid (aether)
        we should
        eventually be able to utilize this very basic energy through
        direct means
        and highly efficiently (more than 100%). That day is now
        approaching.
      </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><b>III. Conclusions</b>
      </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">Rhysmonic cosmology is continuing to develop
        into
        a simple but sound approach to cosmology and thus increasing
        expectations
        in both the theoretical and technological fall-out. Within my
        very limited
        time here, I will continue to report to you on any further
        thoughts or
        discoveries. I will not be able to do much in terms of
        experiments in the
        near future and it would be nice to have a little more help (ala
        Bill Ramsay)
        in these lines, as well as more comments on the theory. I wish
        all the
        best regards and good experimenting.

      <p class="MsoNormal">Later observations. Is this real or just
        possibly
        a 'local' phenomenon, a product of our local power company?

      <p class="MsoNormal">More on the simple coil test of 11/26/95.
      </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">While some personal problems have limited my
        research
        activity here in recent months, I did find some time to briefly
        follow
        a simple coil test a bit. I used a coil taken from a 120 to 12.5
        volt miniature
        Radio Shack transformer, Part No. 273-1385. The primary was
        connected to
        the home water pipe system and the vintage (tube type)
        oscilloscope was
        used for qualitative tests only. The 12.5 volt secondary winding
        was connected
        to a frequency meter. With this setup (shown in Fig. 1) the
        sharp input
        pulse was readily seen as well as its exponential decay, see
        Fig. 3. Moreover,
        the non-decaying 'wave- packet' type of traces also showed up
        well, as
        is seen in Fig. 3.</p>

    <div class="MsoNormal">
      <blockquote>[Figures 1, 2, 3 are in the Newsletter.]</blockquote>
    </div>
    <div class="MsoNormal">
      <blockquote>It was noticed that the wave-packet traces were seen
        with different
        amplitudes during the course of the day, and at times, the
        amplitude would
        vary more rapidly at a frequency of less than 1 Hz to a few Hz.
        These fluctuations
        may be related to the variations in the earth-ionosphere complex
        which
        is largely 'excited' by the solar wind and thus may be more
        active during
        daylight hours. At other times, a fairly high-level response was
        seen,
        generally around 40-50 KHz or so. This response was slightly
        distorted
        (and at times asymmetric) compared to the more normal response.
        This seemed
        to be due to some other man-made 'excitation,' as it was seen to
        be suddenly
        turned on and off, and apparently was not present on weekends!
        Outside
        of the work-week or HAARP? An attempt was made to identify some
        'resonances'
        in the normal type resonances. To enhance the output, a ferrite
        core was
        placed within the coil. The responses were now more sinusoidal
        and easily
        showed their multiple 'excitations.' A limited test showed
        possible resonances
        at 3, 10, 18, 24, 32, 47, 68, 90, and 130 KHz. Moreover, some of
        these
        frequencies are quite close to those noted in some Mini-MRA
        tests which
        developed fairly decent sinusoidals and over-unity operation!
        Therefore,
        there could be a relation here?
        <p><b>Conclusions</b>
        </p>
        <p>If more of you colleagues would look into this experiment,
          then perhaps
          we could learn if this was a factor in free energy devices?
          The effects
          here appear to me to be related to some persistent 'Universe'
          excitations
          (using 'modulation' by various scalar fields) and which I had
          reported
          to you in various Notes and papers. In this particular case,
          the initiating
          scalar impulse (Pk) may be from the 60 Hz 'leakage' fields as
          developed
          between the water pipe system and the utility line return
          (neutral). This
          impulse (loaded only by the scope input) is shown in Fig. 2.
          This is 60
          Hz (plus some harmonics) and it is very high in voltage but
          very low in
          current. The primary was opened at point Z for the measurement
          of Fig.
          2. When the 60 Hz leakage input is 'driving' the low
          resistance primary
          coil winding (no ferrite used), the response is low-level and
          largely as
          shown in Fig. 3. However, when a ferrite core is used and
          'tuned' to about
          17.2 Khz, the responses are more equalized and increase to
          about 1.2 V
          AC (rms) at about 40 µA (rms), and the waveforms are quite
          sinusoidal
          now. Some other resonant points showed similar responses! I
          will have more
          on these particular aspects as time permits. Good
          experimenting.</p>
