      </p>
      <p>Are gravitational waves the source of noise in electronic
        devices? The
        author believes so, and describes a simple circuit to detect the
        waves.
      </p>
      <p>The author has developed a new cosmology that predicts the
        existence
        of a new type of gravitational signal. We are publishing the
        results of
        some of his experiments in the hope that it will foster
        experimentation
        as well as alternate explanations for his results.
      </p>
      <p>Einstein predicted the existence of gravity waves -- the
        counterpart
        of light and radio waves -- many years ago. However, he
        predicted the existence
        of quadrature-type gravity waves. Unfortunately, no one has been
        able to
        detect quadrature-type gravity waves.
      </p>
      <p>Consequently, the author developed, over the years, a new
        cosmology,
        or theory of the universe, in&nbsp; which monopole gravity waves
        are predicted.
        The author's theory does not preclude the existence of
        Einsteinian gravity
        waves, but they are viewed as being extremely weak, very long in
        wavelength,
        and therefore very difficult to detect unequivocally. Monopole
        signals,
        however, are relatively strong, so they are much more easily
        detected.
      </p>
      <p>Monopole gravity waves have been detected for many years; it's
        just
        that we've been used to calling them 1/f "noise" signals or
        flicker noise.
        Those noise signals can be seen in low-frequency electronic
        circuits. More
        recently, such signals have been called Microwave Background
        Radiation
        (MBR); most scientists believe that to be a relic of the
        so-called "big
        bang" that created the universe.
      </p>
      <p>In the author's&nbsp; cosmology, the universe is considered to
        be a
        finite, spherical, closed system; in other words, it is a black
        body.
      </p>
      <p>Monopole gravity waves "propagate" any distance in Planck time,
        which
        is about 10<sup>-44 </sup>seconds; hence, their effects appear
        everywhere
        almost instantaneously. The sum total of background flux in the
        universe
        gives rise to the observed microwave temperature, in our
        universe, of about
        three degrees kelvin.
      </p>
      <p>Sources of monopole gravity waves include common astrophysical
        phenomena
        like supernovas, novas, starquakes, etc., as well as earthly
        phenomena
        like earthquakes, core movements, etc. Those sorts of cosmic and
        earthly
        events cause delectable temporary variations in the amount of
        gravitational-impulse
        radiation present in the universe.
      </p>
      <p>Novas, especially supernovas (which are large exploding stars),
        are
        very effective generators of oscillatory monopole gravity waves.
        Those
        signals have a Gaussian waveshape and a lifetime of only a few
        tens of
        milliseconds. They can readily impart a portion of their energy
        to free
        particles like molecules, atoms, and electrons.
      </p>
      <p>The background flux, in general, is fairly constant. Variations
        in the
        background flux are caused by movements of large mass
        concentrations like
        galaxies, super-galaxies, and black holes.
      </p>
      <p>These movements create gravitational "shadows," analogous to
        optical
        shadows. When the earth-moon-sun alignment is just right, the
        gravitational
        shadow of a small, highly concentrated mass -- a black hole, for
        example
        -- can be detected and tracked from the Earth. So, keeping those
        facts
        in mind, let's look at several practical methods of detecting
        gravitational
        energy.
      </p>
      <p><b><font size="+1">Electrons and Capacitors</font></b>
      </p>
      <p>As stated above, gravity-wave energy can be imparted to
        ordinary objects.
        Of special interest to us are the loosely-bound electrons in
        ordinary capacitors.
        Perhaps you have wondered how a discharged high-valued
        electrolytic capacitor
        (say 1000 uF at 35 volts) can develop a charge even though it is
        disconnected
        from an electrical circuit.
      </p>
      <p>While some of that charging could be attributed to a chemical
        reaction
        in the capacitor, I believe that much of it is caused by
        gravity-wave impulses
        bathing the capacitor at all times. And the means by which
        gravity waves
        transfer energy is similar to another means of energy transfer
        that is
        well known to readers of <i>Radio-Electronics</i>: the electric
        field.
      </p>
      <p>As shown in <b>Figure (1a)</b>, the presence of a large mass
        near the
        plates of a capacitor causes a polarized alignment of the
        molecules in
        the capacitor, as though an external DC voltage had been applied
        to the
        capacitor, as shown in <b>Figure (1b)</b>.
      </p>
      <p><b><font size="+1">Figure 1</font></b>
      </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="fig1.gif" width="337" height="636"></p>
      </center>
      <p>You can verify that yourself: Drop a fully-discharged 1000-uF,
        35-volt
        electrolytic capacitor broadside on a hard surface from a height
        of two
        or three feet. Then measure the voltage across the capacitor
        with a high-impedance
        voltmeter.
      </p>
      <p>You will find a voltage of about 10 to 50 mV. Drop the
        capacitor several
        times on opposite sides, don't let it bounce, and note how
        charge builds
        up to a saturation level that may be as high as one volt.
      </p>
      <p>In that experiment, the energy of free-fall is converted to
        polarization
        energy in the capacitor. The loosely-bound electrons are
        literally "jarred"
        into new polarization positions.
      </p>
      <p>In a similar manner, gravitational impulses from space "jar"
        electrons
        into new polarization positions.
      </p>
      <p>Here's another experiment: Monitor a group of similar
        capacitors that
        have reached equilibrium conditions while being bathed by normal
        background
        gravitational impulses.
      </p>
      <p>You'll observe that, over a period of time, the voltage across
        all those
        open-circuited capacitors will be equal, and that it will depend
        only on
        the average background flux at the time. Temperature should be
        kept constant
        for that experiment.
      </p>
      <p>I interpret those facts to mean that a capacitor develops a
        charge that
        reflects the monopole gravity-wave signals existing at that
        particular
        location in the universe. So, although another device could be
        used, we
        will use a capacitor as the sensing element in the gravity-wave
        detectors
        described next.
      </p>
      <p><b><font size="+1">The Simplest Detector</font></b>
      </p>
      <p>Monopole gravity waves generate small impulse currents that may
        be coupled
        to an op-amp configured as a current-to-voltage converter, as
        shown in
        <b>Figure
          (2)</b>. The current-to-voltage converter is a nearly lossless
        current-measuring
        device.
      </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="fig2.gif" width="359" height="337"></p>
      </center>
      <p>It gives an output voltage that is proportional to the product
        of the
        input current (which can be in the picoampere range) and
        resistor R<sub>1</sub>.
        Linearity is assured because the non-DC-connected capacitor
        maintains the
        op-amp's input terminals at virtual ground.
      </p>
      <p>The detector's output may be coupled to a high-impedance
        digital or
        analog voltmeter, an audio amplifier, or an oscilloscope. In
        addition,
        a chart recorder could be used to record the DC output over a
        period of
        time, thus providing a record of long-term "shadow-drift"
        effects.
      </p>
      <p>Resistor R<sub>2</sub> and capacitor C<sub>2 </sub>protect the
        output
        of the circuit; their values will depend on what you're driving.
        To experiment,
        try a 1k resistor and a 0.1 uF capacitor.
      </p>
      <p>The output of the detector (E<sub>o</sub>) may appear in two
        forms,
        depending on whether or not stabilizing capacitor Cx is
        connected. When
        it is, the output will be highly amplified 1/f noise signals, as
        shown
        in <b>Figure (3a)</b>.
      </p>
      <p>Without Cx, the circuit becomes a "ringing" circuit with a
        slowly decaying
        output that has a resonant frequency of 500-600 Hz for the
        component values
        shown. In that configuration, the circuit&nbsp; is a Quantum
        Non-Demolition
        (QND) circuit, as astrophysicists call it; it will now actually
        display
        the amplitude variations (waveshapes) of the passing
        gravitational-impulse
        bursts, as shown in <b>Figure (3b)</b>.
      </p>
      <p>An interesting variation on the detector may be built by
        increasing
        the value of sensing capacitor C<sub>1</sub> to about 1000-1600
        uF. After
        circuit stability is achieved, the circuit will respond to
        almost all gravity-wave
        signals in the universe. By listening carefully to the audio
        output of
        the detector you can hear not only normal 1/f noise, but also
        many "musical"
        sounds of space, as well as other effects that will not be
        disclosed here.

      <p><b><font size="+1">An Improved Detector</font></b>
      </p>
      <p>Adding a buffer stage to the basic circuit, as shown in <b>Figure
          (4)</b>,
        makes the detector easier to work&nbsp; with. The IC used is a
        common 1458
        (which is a dual 741). One op-amp is used as the detector, and
        the other
        op-amp multiplies the detector's output by a factor of 20.
        Potentiometer
        R<sub>3</sub> is used to adjust the output to the desired level.

        <p><img src="fig4.gif" width="341" height="288"></p>
      </center>
      <p>When used unshielded, the circuits presented here are not only
        sensitive
        detectors of&nbsp;&nbsp; gravitational impulses, but also of
        ‘electromagnetic’
        signals ranging from 50-500 GHz!&nbsp; Hence, these circuits
        could be used
        to detect many types of signals, including radar signals.
      </p>
      <p>To detect only gravity&nbsp; waves, and not EMI, the circuit
        should
        be shielded against all&nbsp; electromagnetic radiation. Both
        circuits
        are low in cost and easy to build. Assembly is non-critical,
        although proper
        wiring practices should be followed.
      </p>
      <p>Initially, you should use the op-amps specified; don't
        experiment with
        other devices until you attain satisfactory results with the
        devices called
        for. Later you can experiment with other components, like
        low-power op-amps,
        especially CMOS types, which have diodes across their inputs to
        protect
        them against high input voltages.
      </p>
      <p>Those diodes make them much less sensitive to electromagnetic
        radiation,
        so circuits that use those devices may be used to detect
        gravity-waves
        without shielding.
      </p>
      <p>The circuit in <b>Figure (4)</b> is the QND or ringing type,
        but the
        feedback resistance is variable from 0.5 to 2 megohms. That
        allows you
        to tune the circuit to the natural oscillating frequency of
        different astrophysical
        events.
      </p>
      <p>Huge supernova bursts, for example, have much larger
        amplitudes, and
        much lower frequencies&nbsp; of&nbsp; oscillation than normal
        supernovas
        and novas.&nbsp; Hence you can tune the detector for the
        supernova burst
        rate that interests you.&nbsp; With the component values given
        in <b>Figure
          (4)</b>, the resonant frequency of the circuit can be varied
        between 300-900
        Hz. The circuit of <b>Figure (4)</b>, or a variant thereof, was
        used to
        obtain all the experimental data discussed below.
      </p>
      <p>In addition, the circuits that we've described in this article
        were
        built in an aluminum chassis and then located within an
        additional steel
        box to reduce pickup of stray EMI. Power and output connections
        were made
        through filter-type feedthrough capacitors.
      </p>
      <p>In the QND mode, coupling the detector's output to an audio
        amplifier
        and an oscilloscope gives impressive sound and sight effects.
      </p>
      <p>Fluctuations generally reflect passing gravitational shadows.
        The author
        has taken much data of the sort to be discussed; let's examine a
        few samples
        of that data to indicate the kind of results you can expect, and
        ways of
        interpreting those results.
      </p>
      <p><b><font size="+1">Sample Scans</font></b>
      </p>
      <p>Shown in <b>Figure (5)</b> is an unusual structure that was
        repeated
        exactly the next day, but four minutes earlier. The pattern was
        followed
        for several weeks, moving four minutes earlier per day.
      </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="fig5.gif" width="438" height="304"></p>
      </center>
      <p>That confirms the observation that the burst response of the
        detector
        was related to our location on earth with respect to the rest of
        the universe.
        The change of four minutes per day corresponds with the relative
        movements
        of the earth and the body that was casting the "shadow."
      </p>
      <p>The plot of <b>Figure (6)</b> appears to be a supernova,
        probably in
        our own galaxy, caught in the act of exploding. The plot of <b>Figure
          (7)</b>
        was made four days after another supernova explosion; that plot
        reveals
        that that supernova left a well-developed black hole and "ring"
        structure.
      </p>
      <center>

        </p>
        <p><img src="fig7.gif" width="444" height="314"></p>
      </center>
      <p>You may find it interesting to consider that visual indications
        of those
        supernovas will not be seen for several thousand years!&nbsp; As
        such,
        it might be "quite a while" before we get a visual confirmation
        of our
        suspected supernova!
      </p>
      <p>Last, <b>Figure (8)</b> shows a plot of the moon's
        gravitational shadow
        during the eclipse of&nbsp; May&nbsp; 30,&nbsp;
        1984.&nbsp;&nbsp; Note
        that the gravitational shadow preceded the optical shadow by
        about eight
        minutes!
      </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="fig8.gif" width="449" height="302"></p>
      </center>
      <p>That gives credence to our claim that gravitational effects
        propagate
        instantaneously. Relatedly, but not shown here, a deep shadow is
        consistently
        detected whenever the center of the galaxy appears on the
        meridian (180
        degrees), hinting of the existence of a "black hole" in that
        region.
      </p>
      <p><b><font size="+1">Conclusions</font></b>
      </p>
      <p>In this article we discussed the highlights of a new theory of
        the universe
        that predicts the existence of monopole gravity waves. We then
        presented
        details of a circuit that can be used to detect monopole gravity
        waves.
      </p>
      <p>The author has monitored those signals for ten years so is
        confident
        that you will be able to duplicate those results.&nbsp; Needless
        to say,
        the subject of gravity waves is a largely unexplored one, and
        there is
        much yet to be learned.
      </p>
      <p>Perhaps this article will inspire you to contribute to that
        knowledge.
        In your experiments, you might consider trying&nbsp; the
        following: Operate
        several detector circuits at the same time and record the
        results.
      </p>
      <p>Separate the detectors -- even by many miles -- and record
        their outputs.
        In such experiments, the author found that the circuits' outputs
        were very
        similar. Those results would seem to count out local EMI or pure
        random
        noise as the cause of the circuit response.
      </p>

        Measurements"
        in <i>Science</i>, Volume 209, August 1,1980 contains useful

        on the QND type of measurement used here.

      <p>Each rhysmon has the attributes of size, shape, position, and
        velocity;
        rhysmons are arranged in space in a matrix structure, the
        density of which
        varies according to position in the universe.
      </p>
      <p>The matrix structure of rhysmons in free space gives rise to
        the fundamental
        units of length, time, velocity, mass, volume, density, and
        energy discovered
        by physicist Max Planck.
      </p>
      <p>Fundamental postulates of the Rhysmonic Universe can be
        summarized as
        follows:
      </p>
      <p>The universe is finite and spherical Euclidean geometry is
        sufficient
        to describe Rhysmonic Space.
        <br>
        The edge of the universe is a perfect reflector of energy.
        <br>
        Matter forms only in the central portion of the universe.
      </p>
      <p>The matrix structure of rhysmons allows the instantaneous
        transmission
        of energy along a straight&nbsp; line, called&nbsp; an&nbsp;
        energy vector,
        from the&nbsp; point of origin to the edge of the universe,
        where it would
        be reflected according to laws similar those governing spherical
        optics.
      </p>
      <p>In Rhysmonic Cosmology, mass, inertia, and energy are treated
        as they
        are in classical mechanics. Mass arises, according to the
        author, because
        particles in rhysmonic cosmology must be the result of changes
        in the `density'
        of the rhysmonic structure, since the universe is nothing more
        than rhysmons
        and the void."
      </p>
      <p>In a "dense" area of the universe, such as the core of a
        particle, a
        number of rhysmons are squeezed together. This means that every
        particle
        has a correlating anti-particle, or an area of correspondingly
        low density.
        In addition, a particle has an excess of outward-directed energy
        vectors,
        and an anti-particle has an excess of inward-directed energy
        vectors. Those
        vectors are what we usually call electric charge.
      </p>
      <p>Gravity is not a force of attraction between objects; rather,
        two objects
        are impelled towards each other by energy vectors impinging on
        the surfaces
        of those objects that do not face each other. Newton's laws of
        gravitation
        hold, although their derivation is different than in Newton's
        system.
      </p>
      <p>Gravitational waves arise in various ways, but, in general, a
        large
        astronomical disturbance, such as the explosion of a supernova,
        instantaneously
        modulates the rhysmonic energy vectors. That modulation might
        then appear,
        for example, superimposed on the Earth's gravitational-field
        flux -- and
        it would be detectable by circuits like those described here.
