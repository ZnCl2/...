      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Introduction:</font></b>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Impulse gravimeter Circuit
          #2005
          is fabricated in a plastic box 1.5" x 2.5" x 5" in size but
          with an aluminum
          cover plate. All operating controls are brought out on this
          panel, as well
          as an output jack and a small (1.5" square) zero-center
          calibrated meter,
          used to give a display of the output voltage of the unit. A
          dual 1.5 volt
          battery supply is self-contained in the unit. The unit is
          primarily designed
          to demonstrate the gravitational ‘impulses’ generated by the
          numerous Newtonian-type
          gradients developed in this universe.</font>
      </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The Circuit:</font></b>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The circuit used in this
          unit (<b><a href="#9r">Figure
              1</a></b>) is a typical electronic-type gravimeter, but
          has had the parameters
          adjusted for this particular application. The unit was
          designed around
          a quad-type C-MOS IC op-amp which performs very well with a
          1.5 volt power
          supply. This ICL7641 device can operate over the full range of
          the supply
          voltage, i.e., over the rail-to-rail range of 1.5 volts.
          However, the operating
          parameters for this unit were adjusted to that the unit
          operates in the
          sensitive range of =/- 0.5 volts in order to agree with the
          scale calibration
          on the display meter used.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The detector section (IC<sub>1</sub>)
          is typical, but the sensing capacitor, C<sub>in</sub>, and the
          feedback
          resistance, R<sub>f</sub>, have been adjusted to this
          particular device
          for optimum performance at the +/- 1.5 volt supply operation
          with an output
          in the +/- 0.5 volt range and also to keep the input circuit
          resonances
          very much below 1 Hz, so as to avoid the many ELF ‘resonances’
          seen in
          this universe (which would complicate the desired responses).
          Some measure
          of sensitivity control was provided by the gain control in the
          feedback
          circuit. The output of the detector section is buffered by IC<sub>2</sub>
          before being fed into the amplifier stage.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The amplifier stage, IC<sub>3</sub>,
          is an inverting-type having a gain of only about 5x to limit
          the response
          of the unit to the desired output ranges. An off-set control
          (Set) is included
          here to enable the adjustment of the averaged output signals
          of the unit
          to about center-scale on either side of the zero-center meter
          circuit.
          This enables operation of the unit with a choice of pulse
          polarity, e.g.,
          the negative mode of operation would allow an increase in the
          detected
          value of the earth’s g-field to read up-scale on the meter
          circuit.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The output of the gain stage
          is also
          buffered by IC<sub>4</sub> before it is fed to the internal
          low-pass filter
          and meter sections of the unit. In this particular unit, the
          filter and
          meter sections were combined for use as a portable calibrated
          gravimeter
          unit. However, an output jack was provided for use with an
          external high
          impedance meter or a strip chart recorder unit. The filter
          section was
          designed for a cut-off frequency of about 10 Hz for a good
          response to
          the gravitational signals from the Local Supercluster of
          Galaxies, as well
          as the Milky Way Galaxy. However, this internal filter can be
          cut-out (in
          the filter of position) if one desires to follow the very fast
          responses
          of the very remote events in the universe.</font>
      </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Operation:</font></b>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Operation of the unit is
          very simple:
          Turn on the power supply and allow the unit a minute or two to
          stabilize.
          Set the off-set and gain controls to about their
          mid-positions, and the
          filter to the off position. The gravity signals should now be
          quite apparent
          as fairly rapid excursions on the meter. The gain control can
          now be adjusted
          for the desired level of excursions --- higher gain means
          greater amounts
          of excursion. The off-set control should now be adjusted to
          read the impulses
          on either side of the zero center scale, depending on the
          desired pulse
          polarity. Place the filter switch to the on position to limit
          the unit
          response to the nearby galaxies (normal mode of operation).
          The off-set
          control should be used to properly position the response on
          the built-in
          meter or an external meter or strip chart recorder unit. The
          output polarity
          is adjustable with the off-set control or just the reversing
          of the output
          leads. The experimenter should become quite adept at using
          this unit in
          very short order.</font>
      </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Conclusions:</font></b>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">While this unit was
          primarily intended
          for response to the fairly rapid ‘universe’ gravitational
          response, it
          may also be used as a g-factor gravimeter by loading the
          output with a
          capacitor in the range of 21,000 uF to 100,000 uF (observing
          proper polarity),
          to increase the output time constant to such long periods that
          the unit
          will respond to only the very slow changes in the earth’s
          g-field levels.
          This is best done with the output jack brought out to an
          external meter
          and capacitor load, using the output jack provided. With the
          judicious
          selection of the operating parameters it should be possible to
          set the
          unit to read (32) or (98) on a meter scale to conform to a
          g-factor of
          32 ft/sec<sup>2</sup> or 980 cm/sec<sup>2</sup> . Thus the
          unit would be
          a direct reading g-factor gravimeter for many purposes. This
          type of operation
          will also disclose to the experimenter the subtle daily
          changes in the
          earth’s gravity field which are presently affecting our
          weather patterns
          (not always to the good!)</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">While the current
          requirements for
          this unit are very low, the experimenter should use ‘good’
          batteries for
          best results. The unit is a very good introduction to the new
          field of
          gravitational astronomy for the serious experimenter or
          researcher. Good
          experimenting to all!</font>
