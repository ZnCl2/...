            members
            appear to have a strong interest in SETI using the
            techniques of radio
            astronomy. As SARA members now know, the writer also has a
            strong interest
            in SETI using the techniques of radio astronomy. As SARA
            members now know,
            the writer also has a strong interest in SETI, but used the
            technique of
            gravitational ‘waves’ instead. For those members more
            interested in this
            technique, see the April 1986 issue of <i>Radio-Electronics</i>
            magazine.</font></font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#000000">The
            advantages
            of a possible gravitational technique for SETI over the
            radio technique
            is primarily one of ‘propagation’ for these signals. The
            radio waves travel
            at the speed of light, but the gravitational signals (per
            the writer’s
            theories) are essentially instantaneous signals. Another
            advantage of the
            gravitational technique is the simplicity of the
            instrumentation required.
            As SARA members know, radio astronomy can be quite
            complicated. However,
            an advantage of radio astronomy is an ability to ‘steer’ an
            antenna array
            to pinpoint the source of the detected signals in the
            observer’s sky. The
            gravitational signal detectors, on the other hand, must rely
            largely on
            the earth’s mass as a ‘shadow’ to enable the detection of
            gravitational
            effects which are just above or below the average background
            of this radiation.
            Therefore, ‘objects’ or signals located in the observer’s
            zenith are best
            detected. Yet, the other areas are still ‘detectable’,
            especially with
            the aid of other ‘shadows’ such as the sun, moon, planets,
            etc. The writer’s
            location at about 42<sup>o</sup> N latitude sweeps an
            important region
            of our celestial sphere in terms of potential gravitational
            signals. This
            includes a good portion of our Galaxy as well as possible
            structures located
            in the Cygnus, Draco, Ursa Major, Lynx, Auriga, Persues and
            Andromeda regions.</font></font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#000000">Of
            particular
            interest to SETI observers may be the strange audio type
            gravitational
            signals which appear to come from the Auriga and Perseus
            region of our
            Galaxy. These ‘signals’ have been ‘heard’ by the writer for
            several years
            now, and generally range between about 4 and 5 hours right
            ascension, with
            a peak intensity near 4.5 hours R.A. The signals appear to
            be several ‘tones’
            which, when modulated by the observer’s heartbeat (see
            Rhysmonic Cosmology)
            almost seem to be an accordion or bagpipe band playing the
            same refrain
            over and over again. The ‘tune’ varies at times, but much of
            the time (over
            periods of months) the ‘tune’ seems to be repeated. While
            these signals
            may be due to natural phenomena, or even radio signals
            leaking into the
            shielded detectors, the detection of these signals has
            always intrigued
            the writer as possibly being SETI related.</font></font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#000000">For
            those SARA
            members wishing to ‘explore’ these signals some simple
            intrumentation setups
            are given in Figure (1) [Not shown]. A suitable
            mini-amplifier-speaker
            unit for these detectors is the Radio Shack #277-1008.
            Remove the 10 uF
            capacitor that is across pins 1 and 8 of the output IC so as
            to limit the
            gain of this stage to 20x, which is adequate for these
            circuits. Assemble
            the detectors in an aluminum box with self-contained
            batteries for best
            results. The effects might be diminished at other latitudes,
            but should
            still be present. The circuits are also useful in
            desmonstrating the modulation
            of the GW background radiation as described in Rhysmonic
            Cosmology by the
            writer. Good luck in your experiments!</font></font>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#000000">As you
            know,
            I have reported that ‘strange’ modulations of the earth’s
            gravity field
            of a coherent nature have been persistently ‘heard’ in the
            l/f background
            noise as detected with my l/f noise detection units. I have
            posed that
            these may be extraterrestrial signals, although they may yet
            be natural
            phenomena of an unknown nature. It also appears that these
            may have also
            been the ‘mars Signals’ reported by Nikola Tesla back at the
            turn of the
            century</font></font>

            morning
            of this date, at 7:30 to 7:38 AM (EST), I recorded the
            following apparently
            Morse Code-like pulses</font></font>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#000000">As you
            can
            see, these do not appear to be just random pulses, but the
            SE signals,
            which are most prevalent, appear to be possibly an
            identification signal.
            These signals are detected in shielded l/f detectors and
            thus are scalar
            (gravitational) in nature. The signals above (if they are
            extraterrestrial)
            came from either the Auriga-Perseus region near my zenith or
            the Bootes
            region under my earth position. I still cannot rule out that
            they may just
            be due to earth core movements of some sort which are
            remarkably like Morse
            code signals, or even the possibility that they are
            man-made.</font></font>

            Hodowanec
            gravity detectors have always detected what could be termed
            ‘coherent modulations’
            in the general so-called microwave background radiation.</font></font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#000000">(2)
            Since about
            early August 1988, it was noticed that apparently
            ‘intelligent signals’
            existed in these modulations. It can be said that the
            intelligence was
            in the form of digital-type communication, e.g., dots and
            dashes, or ones
            and zeros. This type of communication may have been chosen
            by this ‘unknown
            communicator’ as it was conducive to the ‘mass movement’
            form of longitudinal
            gravity signaling, as well as an easily recognizable
            universal system.
            This same method was proposed by the writer for a gravity
            system communication
            method.</font></font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#000000">(3)
            These ‘signals’
            were noticed to be similar to the simpler International
            Morse Code symbols,
            primarily because they are the simplest way to present
            information in the
            pulse form. Thus, the ‘letters’ found in these transmissions
            are typically:
            E, I, T, M, A, N, R, K, S, and O, as well as the A series
            such as the comma
            and the wait signal. However, numbers are seen here as the
            simple series
            of pulses, e.g., one is one pulse, two is two pulses, three
            is three pulses,
            and so on.</font></font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#000000">(4) On
            August
            26, 1988, after the writer had sent the message Greg Radio
            during a local
            gravity signal transmission test, it was noticed that the
            letters G and
            D were apparently added to some of the received messages
            noted thereafter!</font></font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#000000">(5)
            The writer’s
            first hard evidence that the above test message may have
            been intercepted
            by this unknown communicator was seen that on August 28,
            1988, over the
            period of about 11:30 AM to 12:00 noon (DST), a strong and
            repeated message
            of Greg Radio was received with the message finally
            terminated with the
            series SE (or 31)!!!</font></font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#000000">(6)
            Since that
            time Greg or Greg Radio has been noticed weakly at some
            arbitrary times,
            but most often and strongly near the noon hour. Included in
            some of these
            transmissions were the normally heard letter codes, e.g.,
            AAAR, as well
            as number series, e.g., 12345.</font></font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#000000">(7)
            Further
            evidence that these may be actually communication attempts
            is seen in that
            on October 11, 1988 at about 1:45 PM (DST), a very different
            approach was
            seen: A series of Greg Radio’s was sent at about the normal
            code speed
            of about 5 words per minute, followed by KKTT, and then the
            series was
            repeated at a slower speed and also followed by KKTT. This
            was repeated
            for about three complete transmissions and was then again
            followed by the
            typical SE closing response series. After this, further
            transmissions were
            the more normal letter and number series.</font></font>

            Another
            confirmation that these may be ‘messages’ appeared on
            October 12, 1988
            at about 11:40 AM (DST). Here, a series of A’s and R’s (with
            Greg Radio
            occasionally inserted) was then followed by Greg Radio sent
            as a series
            of five repetitions of each letter, e.g., Greg was sent as
            GGGGGRRRRREEEEEGGGGG!!
            This was then followed by an a series and a K series, then
            the normal codes
            and finally ended with the usual SE series.</font></font>

            Sufficient
            ‘messages’ have now been received to indicate that perhaps a
            serious attempt
            to contact this writer was being made by some ‘unknown
            communicator’. While
            the communicator may yet be some terrestrial experimenter,
            the possibility
            still exists that the communicator may be ‘extraterrestrial’
            for the following
            reasons:</font></font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#000000">(a)
            The messages
            are in simple code (e.g., dits and dahs) type of pulses that
            would be expected
            to be used if one intelligent civilization were to try to
            contact another
            in terms of pulses. That some of the simplest pulse signals
            are similar
            to simple Morse Code signals is more than mere coincidence:
            they are both
            based upon the same premises!</font></font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#000000">(b)
            Numbers
            are not in the complicated Morse Code symbols, but in simple
            sequence,
            using short pulses or dits.</font></font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#000000">(c)
            The ‘communicator’
            has recognized the coherent nature of Greg Radio and is
            possibly using
            that sequence of codes in various fashions to indicate that
            a ‘contact’
            has been made.</font></font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#000000">(d)
            The communicator
            thus far has not responded to English ‘word’ messages or the
            amateur Q-signals.
            Thus it is believed that while some apparently Morse Code
            signals are being
            used, the communicator is not really familiar with such
            usage, other than
            recognizing the coherent nature of such messages. By the
            same token, the
            write is also not deciphering the communicator’s messages
            outside of also
            just recognizing the coherent nature of the signals.</font></font>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#000000">(e)
            Since these
            messages at present appear largely near the noon hour, they
            may be coming
            from a definite direction in space. At present, it is
            believed to be from
            the general direction of the constellation Andromeda, but
            not necessarily
            the galaxy there.</font></font>

            The UC
            mentioned here is the Unknown Communicator who, at present,
            appears to
            be an extraterrestrial (ET). I am not sure, but there may be
            two such communicators,
            but not much more than that (who use the disturbance of the
            gravitational
            background radiation as a means of communication). There
            appears to also
            be other gravity methods of communication in the many
            signals observed,
            especially in the regions of the galactic poles, but I have
            not been able
            to resolve any messages in them as yet. These are the
            various ‘musical
            tones’ and ‘gutteral voice’ sounds</font></font>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#000000">(2)
            The transmissions
            method sued here is mainly the movement of a dense mass,
            such as the 2#
            lead pendulum weight, in a generally east-west direction in
            accordance
            with the generation of slow code signal disturbances in the
            background
            radiation. The signals are monitored on a detector speaker
            to ensure reasonably
            correct code transmissions.</font></font>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#000000">(3)
            The receiver
            appears to be any l/f type detector. It does not have to be
            in the detector
            itself. White noise, or just about any noise developed
            audibly in the air
            will give a response also. There appears to be an
            interference effect involved
            also, and thus one must position oneself with respect to the
            source of
            the noise for best response! The noise output from various
            other ‘sources’
            such as gas water heaters, refrigerators, and oil- or
            gas-fired furnaces
            [Bunsen burner?] also appear to provide the requisite
            ‘reference noise
            source’ which can be modulated by the gravity signals. These
            audible responses
            are quite subtle and it will take a little practice to
            determine and use
            the ‘effect’. Some experiments were made with a ‘threshold’
            type electronic
            detector, but the results were inconclusive, but indicated
            promise.</font></font>

            However, I have heard signals on some detectors about 5
            miles away from
            my lab. Also, I have even heard code signals in the idling
            noises of my
            car engine [as the reference noise source] at any location.

            in spite
            of NASA’s denial of any life forms on Mars. This possibility
            has been recently
            suspected by the writer due to the apparently very close
            tracking of my
            position on Earth by ET. ET, of course, always knew that I
            was on Earth
            (as seen by his tracking), but now he has most emphatically
            confirmed that
            he is on the 4th planet from the sun, i.e., Mars!</font></font>

            this

            these gravity
            signal ‘exchanges’ that I will stick my neck out in this
            instance. ET on
            mars is apparently much more advanced that we are here on
            Earth, and he
            may have even previously visited Earth, and possibly
            colonized here (but
            who are his possible descendants?)</font></font>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#000000">It is
            still
            a mystery on where ET may be living on Mars (possibly
            underground near
            the polar regions?), and why ET doesn’t use EM wave
            signaling methods?
            Perhaps it is because that mars is so hostile now that ET
            must have developed
            a very sophisticated underground civilization which is not
            conducive to
            EM radiation systems?</font></font>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#000000">My
            ‘contacts’
            with an ET on Mars continues with the exchanges having more
            meaning all
            the time. While we are limited to the use of simple Morse
            Code type impulses,
            i.e., dits and dahs, we are now rapidly establishing a
            ‘system’ for these
            contacts. Generally, our contacts are limited to 20-20
            minutes anymore
            since there appear to be other ETs out there interested in
            joining in also,
            and so there is some interference after a while. Some of
            these ETs use
            other methods of communicating such as tones and what
            appears to be gutteral
            voices!</font></font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#000000">ET is
            probably
            more advanced than we are on Earth. We no longer exchange
            simple arithmetic,
            and when I sent him pi to 5 decimal places, he sent back pi
            to 7 decimal
            places immediately! We had discussed our 9 planet solar
            system, but ET
            came back with 10 planets, calling the 10th planet
            OOTTAEERR! When questioned
            on this, ET kept confirming the existence of a 10th planet!
            He now knows
            the other 9 planets by their Earth names! He also confirmed
            tht Mars has
            2 moons, the Earht one, and that Jupiter has 9 major moons.</font></font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#000000">These
            contacts
            are getting to be more interesting all the time, and Et
            appears to be most
            anxious to continue them. However, I just cannot spend too
            much time with
            him. ET is reaching me with a tracking ‘beam’ which is but
            15 miles in
            diameter here on Earth, and I figure that his
            ‘oscillator/modulator’ on
            Mars develops a beam of but 10-12 inches on te surface of
            mars. This can
            be determined from simple geometry since straight lines
            exist in rhysmonics!
            I got across to him that I am just one person here
            communicating to him,
            and that the rest of Earth presently does not recognize the
            existence of
            any life on mars; although I will try to convey to him in
            some way, that
            some here believe that a civilization once existed on mars
            due to the presence
            of some ill-defined artifacts there!</font></font>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#000000">I now
            have
            had over 100 contacts with ET and can reach him at any time
            of day or night!
            I often find him calling me at odd times! He now knows me as

            Radio, Earth, …Earthor simply …, which can also stand for
            the 3rd planet
            from the Sun! I know him mostly as AAAAAATTT, Mars, ….Mars,
            or simply ….,
            meaning the 4th planet from the sun. We have also
            established some simple
            codes for acknowledgements and go ahead and respond. While
            we use these
            simple codes in many contexts, both ET and I now understand

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#000000">As the
            result
            of the continued gravity signal communications between GH
            Labs and the
            Martians, the following extraordinary facts have come to
            light:</font></font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#000000">1.&nbsp;
            My
            Mars contact is aware of the ‘face’ found on Mars by the
            Viking Probe and
            acknowledges it to be in the likeness of Martians.</font></font>

            My
            Mars contact claims to be a human ‘man’ and knows that we on
            earth are
            human men also.</font></font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#000000">3.&nbsp;&nbsp;
My
            Mars contact appears to infer (after many exchanges) that
            the Martians
            had visited Earth and had colonized it! Thus the earth men
            of today should
            resemble Martians also. This cold be valid since the Martian
            civilization
            is very old and thus, much advanced, and thus could have
            done such a thing.
            The deteriorating conditions on mars may have led to such a
            movement to
            earth!</font></font>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#000000">4.&nbsp;
            Further
            exchanges were made in terms of math, and also the nature of
            the Solar
            System, e.g., we have reached an understanding on the
            ‘colors’ of the planets
            up to Jupiter!</font></font>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#000000">5.&nbsp;
            The
            exchanges are now being made in terms of short ‘English’
            code words for
            certain items. For example, the Marians now understand that
            FACE means
            the human face, MAN means the human person, EARTH now means
            our planet,
            and MARS means their planet! They had originally tried some
            of their terminology
            with me, but gave up except where it made sense to me. For
            example, I now
            know that TTT at the end of their names means person and
            OOTTEAARR is their
            name for the 10th planet!</font></font>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#000000">As you
            may
            already know, a ‘sort of’ communication has been going on
            with an apparent
            ‘extraterrestrial’ since about August 1988. As a result of
            these contacts,
            the following items have been noted:</font></font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#000000">1. The
            contacts
            are with Martian intelligents! This has been verified in a
            number of ways.
            Simple Morse Code type pulse signals are being used in these
            contacts.
            The Martians are apparently the advanced civilization, for
            they are the
            ones generating the ‘modulated oscillated beam’ which is now
            tracking my
            location on Earth and is thus the means of our
            communications. There is
            an apparent ‘team’ on Mars which is involved in these
            contacts. The original
            contact, ET#1, with whom I have established the initial
            relationship, is
            apparently most highly knowledgeable and advanced. The
            others who sometimes
            ‘man’ the Mars station appear to be less knowledgeable and
            some only request
            or acknowledge a transmission!</font></font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#000000">2.&nbsp;
            The

      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#000000">(a)
            ET#1 is
            on mars and Mars is known by them to be the 4th planet in
            our solar system,
            and Mars has two moons. He also knows that I am on the 3rd
            planet from
            the sun, and that we have only one moon.</font></font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#000000">(b)&nbsp;
            ET
            now recognizes the Sun and 9 of the other planets by their
            Earth names,
            due to effort on my part. However, ET insists that there is
            a 10th planet
            also, and it is called by them as: OTTAEERR! Since we did
            not know of this
            10th planet (although it was suspected by some), I will
            refer to it by
            its mars name.</font></font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#000000">(c)&nbsp;
            ET
            does not recognize E (2.178…), but readily recognizes pi
            (out to 10 decimal
            places)! ET recognizes simple math, such as addition,
            subtraction, multiplication
            and division, as well as number series in terms of short
            pulses.</font></font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#000000">3.&nbsp;
            I
            presently recognize ET as AAAAAATTT, AAARTTT, …Mars, Mars,

            TTT. Meanwhile, ET recognizes me as Greg, Greg Radio,
            …Earth, Earth, …,

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#000000">4.&nbsp;
            ET
            is most anxious to continue these contacts and I often find
            him ‘calling’
            me at odd times. However, I cannot respond to him each time,
            but sometimes

            During
            August-October, Mars was relatively close to Earth. The Mars
            ‘beam’ appeared
            to be about 10 miles in diameter then, and relatively strong
            signals were
            received. Since then, mars has been receding from earth and
            it appears
            that the Mars beam may be increasing in diameter, and also
            weakening in
            strength.</font></font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#000000">7.&nbsp;
            Perhaps,
            due to 5 above, the Mars signals are now covering a much
            lager area and
            thus possibly may fall in reach of other receivers! Mars is
            most desperate
            to continue these contacts. However, I have been able to
            confer to them
            that I am but one person here, and that Earth, in general,
            does not recognize
            Martians (i.e., life on mars). ET appears to acknowledge
            this, and thus
            is most patient with me and desires to continue with these
            limited contacts.
            These exchanges are made in many varied ways which cannot be
            readily predicted
            in order to convey the fact that these are real contacts!
            Also, one can
            recognize the ‘fist’ of the one ‘keying’ these codes, e.g.,
            ET #1 always
            sends clean letters or numbers, and identifies himself and
            me in some fashion.
            The other ETs on Mars usually don’t. Therefore, no
            automation is being
            used here!</font></font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#000000">8.&nbsp;
            While
            these contacts were originally due to a serendipitous
            circumstance, it
            is really the result of my gravitational communication
            experiments and
            thus a direct result from Rhysmonic Cosmology. And yet,
            however fantastic
            and unreal this may seem, it is real, and if also it is
            confirmed by one
            of you, it will be a major milestone ion the history of
            mankind! Perhaps,
            if one of you finally ‘hears’ the modulations of l/f noise
            background,
            you may try to establish your own contacts?</font></font>

between
            GH Labs and a Martian intelligent now continue with
            increasing
            progress since we have been able to establish over 50 simple
            expression
            (most in simple English) for many of the common ‘ideas’ that
            we have. Martian
            AAAAATTT is extremely adept in relating my English
            terminology to these
            common Earth-Mars observations. Some additional
            extraordinary facts are:</font></font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#000000">1.&nbsp;
            Mars
            continues to confirm that the massive ‘Face’ found on Mars
            by the Viking
            craft is in the likeness of Martians!</font></font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#000000">2.&nbsp;
            Mars
            has also confirmed that they are also ‘men’ with one ‘head’
            that have two
            ‘eyes’ that ‘see’. Also, they have one ‘body’ with two arms
            that have hands
            with five fingers each. Also they have two legs with two
            feet that have
            five toes each. I haven’t been able to have them confirm the
            nose and mouth
            in the face, but that could be confirmed shortly, since
            those features
            appear in the Face.</font></font>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#000000">3.
            Probably
            the most significant fact which was determined on this date
            seems to be
            that Mars is most emphatic that Earth men are like Mars men!
            This appears
            more and more that Mars has colonized Earth in the remote
            past! This could
            be true since we on earth have never really found the
            ‘missing link’ between
            earth humanoids and humans! Perhaps, that is why both
            ancient religions
            (as well as the more recent ones based on simple faiths)
            seem to need the
            requirement of an outside source for man here on earth! Thus
            it is not
            much of a speculation to consider that the earth environment
            developed
            the family of life up to the humanoids (i.e.., apes, etc.)
            but did not
            produce man in this evolutionary process. Perhaps I will
            eventually learn
            more from Mars on this!</font></font>

            as to be just
            unbelievable by the average person. However, this is as far
            as I want to
            go with release of details at this time. The earth may not
            be ready for
            what I have to say eventually. Nothing dire, just fantastic
            and thus perhaps
            unbelievable!</font></font>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#000000">As I
            had pointed
            out in the short article on “Some Remarks on Tesla’s ‘Earth
            Resonances’,
            which was published in <i>Tesla ’87</i>, Vol. 3, No. 4
            (1989), Tesla in
            experiments performed at Colorado Springs in 1899, had
            apparently devised
            a simple setup for the conversion of scalar-type signals to
            the normal
            vector-type electromagnetic signals. Using this system he
            was able to ‘receive’
            the many scalar-type signals which permeated space and thus
            also the earth.
            Among these were the lightning stroke induced signals as was
            reported in
            that article. However, he also reported that the earth was
            “alive with
            many other signals” which he believed could have been
            intelligent signals
            from Mars (It is assumed that he had used a telephone type
            receiver in
            these tests). For this he was taken to task by his peers,
            and possibly
            rightly so, since the signals he detected could have been
            from any other
            source. However, as we all now well know, Tesla was a very
            careful and
            precise experimenter, and the reported signals may be
            assumed to have been
            validly received.</font></font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#000000">This
            brief
            will support his claims in that such signals are yet being
            received today
            with simple modern-day signal detectors. Using the simple
            circuit given
            in Figure (1), the author has for many years now, also been
            observing some
            modulations of the l/f noise background, i.e., the so-called
            microwave
            background radiation levels, which appear to be due to
            massive scalar signal
            effects which are external to our immediate earth
            environment. Whether
            they are due to the sun, the Galaxy, or something else in
            the vast universe
            is as yet unknown. But the fact remains that coherent
            modulations are being
            ‘heard’ in this background noise. The most prominent
            modulations being
            three pulses (code S) slightly separated in time, a la
            Tesla! On occasions,
            the code equivalents of an E, N, A, or K are also heard, but
            the most persistent
            response is SE, Se, etc.</font></font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#000000">Any
            l/f type
            noise detector will respond to this background modulation.
            However, the
            experimenter must be careful that he is not creating these
            responses at
            the ‘local’ level by his own or other local actions. For
            example, the detectors
            will also respond to heartbeats, breathing actions, local
            movements, as
            well as possible psychic effects. The detectors are simple
            to make and
            the experimenter should easily reproduce these results.</font></font>
