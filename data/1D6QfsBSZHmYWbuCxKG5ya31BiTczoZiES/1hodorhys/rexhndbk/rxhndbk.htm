          center of the Milky Way galaxy. Build a simple gravity
          detector and observe

      </p>
      <p>The main problem today in attempting to observe gravity signals
        has
        been the insistence by astrophysicists that only the quadrupole
        radiated
        gravity signals predicted by Albert Einstein are permissible in
        the universe;
        even though quadrupole-type gravity signals have eluded
        detection. On the
        other hand, monopole-type gravity signals that exist profusely
        in the universe
        are produced by Newtonian gravity gradients, which are easily
        detected
        with a simple device developed by the author.
      </p>
      <p><b>New Scalar Definition</b>
      </p>
      <p>A field in physics may be defined as a region in space which is
        under
        the influence of some effect, typically an electric, magnetic,
        or gravitational
        effect. Vector type fields must be described in terms of both
        magnitude
        and direction. Less understood is the theory of fields that are
        scalar
        in nature and described in terms of magnitude alone. A common
        example of
        a scalar field is temperature; even though the gradient of such
        a field
        will be vectorial. Less well-known are the scalar aspects of
        gravitational,
        electric, and magnetic fields.
      </p>
      <p>The authors uses the term scalar in a unique way. When all the
        vectors
        of a force are directed parallel to each other, the force can be
        fully
        specified by a magnitude only. Therefore, any two faces whose
        vector fields
        run parallel to each other will interact (as scalars) in a
        simple algebraic
        superposition with no need to use vector analysis.
      </p>
      <p>A scalar electric field is realized by the application of a
        voltage
        between two parallel plates, where all the electric lines of
        force are
        parallel to each other. A scalar magnetic field is realized in
        the H-fields
        that emanate from the end of a bar magnet into the space just
        beyond the
        magnet. Such a curl-free magnetic field is scalar for only a
        short distance
        because that is the region where the magnetic flux lines are all
        parallel.
        Similarly, the earth’s gravitational-field is also a scalar
        field because
        the gravity flux is parallel and directed downward only.
      </p>
      <p>It is the author’s presumption that scalar gravitational,
        electric,
        and magnetic fields may interact with each other only when the
        fields run
        exactly parallel. Taking that theory a step farther means that
        energy can
        be transferred from one scalar field to an other.
      </p>
      <p><b>Capacitor Charging</b>
      </p>
      <p>Traditionalists recognize the polarization effect in a
        dielectric that
        us placed between the parallel plates of a capacitor, an
        electric field
        will develop between the plates. A traditionalist would see the
        electric
        field as a vector force directed from the negative plate to the
        positive
        plate. The magnitude would depend upon the intensity of the
        electric field
        generated by the movement of electrons from one plate to the
        other. But
        dew traditionalists recognize the scalar nature of such parallel
        electric
        fields, and their possible interaction with each similarly
        directed A (scalar)
        fields; primarily, earth’s ever-present gravity-field. The
        presence of
        a scalar gravity field on the plates of a capacitor will cause
        the molecules
        to polarize just as though an external DC voltage were being
        applied.
      </p>
      <p>In Figure 1, the dielectric in the capacitor us shown polarized
        by the
        G-fields; that results in a potential difference across the
        capacitor that
        drives a current. Because the G-fields are modulated by various
        universe
        and terrestrial processes, the energy components are both DC and
        AC in
        nature. Therefore, as long as the vectors of the gravitational
        and electric
        fields run parallel to each other, then both fields can be
        considered scalar
        fields, which means energy from one field can be transferred to
        the other.
        The G-field may be visualized as squeezing the plates, however
        minutely.

      <p>Thermal tests were conducted at an independent laboratory.
        Heating the
        electrolytic capacitor in a shielded hot oil bath (75° C.), and
        cooling
        in a shielded ice bath (0° C.) had no discernible effect on
        signal
        output. However, chilling in a shielded dry-ice bath (-79° C)
        resulted
        in a steady decrease in amplitude, frequency, and burst rate
        until the
        only signal remaining was the 1.5 volt DC. The question was
        raised: Shouldn’t
        the burst rate have remained constant if caused by gravity
        waves? The laboratory
        found that the total effective capacitance decreases rapidly at
        temperatures
        less than –30° C. A 300 to 400 fold decrease was observed at
        –79°
        C, so that 1600 uF at –79° C would have an actual capacitance of
        4
        uF; effectively, there was very little capacitance in the
        detector at that
        temperature, which would account for the diminished burst rate.

      <p>Brownian agitation of the electron-ion structure in capacitors
        is attributed
        only to thermal actions by traditionalists. While thermal
        actions contribute
        to some aspects of white-noise, the author concludes that much
        of the white
        noise, and especially the low-frequency l/f type impulse noise,
        is very
        much independent of the thermal environment. Indeed, the energy
        causing
        noise of those types is directly attributable to gravitational
        fields.
        The l/f noise is simply the mathematical expression for the rate
        of occurrence
        of gravity field events. It is termed l/f noise because the
        stronger impulses
        are generated less frequently than the more moderate impulses,
        and the
        moderate impulses are seen less frequently than the weaker
        impulses.
      </p>
      <p>An electrochemical or battery effect does occur in electrolytic
        capacitors,
        thereby introducing an additional small voltage component across
        the capacitor;
        however, the electrochemical voltages are very small when
        compared to the
        G-field effects, and can, therefore, be neglected.
      </p>
      <p>A flat (planar) type of capacitor positioned so that the flat
        side is
        up, is more effective as a gravity-detecting element than a
        tubular-type
        of capacitor. Different capacitor types (electrolytic, mylar,
        polystyrene,
        paper, ceramic, etc) will give the same response to the gravity
        field provided
        the effective capacitances are equal.
      </p>
      <p><b>Gravity Detectors</b>
      </p>
      <p>A scalar G-signal detector is shown in Figure 2. The small
        G-impulse
        current generated across capacitor C<sub>1</sub> is coupled to
        the input
        of IC<sub>1</sub> for amplification. C<sub>1</sub>, and the
        feedback resistance,
        R<sub>1</sub>, are chosen sufficiently high in value so that
        input circuit
        resonances are very much less than 1 Hz.
      </p>
      <center><img src="fig2.gif" width="285" height="328"></center>
      <p>Varying C<sub>1</sub>’s value will have an affect on the
        response time
        to G-field fluctuations; that is because the op-amp’s output is
        a harmonic-type
        oscillation, where the polarization stress induced in the
        capacitor’s dielectric
        by gravity flux is also restored by the reverse electric
        potential developed
        by the feedback resistance in that circuit. Therefore, the
        oscillations
        are a function of both the sensing capacitance and the feedback
        relationship,
        and will give have different frequencies for different capacitor
        and feedback
        resistor values.
      </p>
      <p>The use of CMOS op-amp ICL7611 enables efficient operation with
        a 1.5
        volt battery supply. The unit is assembled in a small aluminum
        box with
        the batteries enclosed within the box, and the output is brought
        out with
        a feedthrough capacitor in order to eliminate any possible
        response to
        ambient RF-type signals.
      </p>
      <p>An improved gravity sensor is shown in Figure 3. The extra
        op-amp, IC<sub>1-b</sub>,
        will add additional gain and frequency stability. Op-amp output
        off-set
        components may be included, however, the author found nulling
        the op-amp
        to be unnecessary. The gravity detector is enclosed within an
        aluminum
        box which is enclosed within an aluminum box which is also
        within another
        heavy steel box in order to shield the detector from any
        electromagnetic
        interference (EMI). A highly permeable magnetic mu-shield was
        also used
        to guard against the Earth’s magnetic field, and stray magnetic
        fields
        generated by the power company’s AC line voltage. However, the
        author found
        mu-shielding unnecessary. Tests shows apparent difference in
        data when
        using a mu-shield, or when the aluminum box was used alone.

      <p>Most gravity detection will require additional output
        filtering, as
        shown in Figure 4. The cut-off frequencies of the filter will
        limit the
        detector’s response to certain astronomical distance ranges. For
        example,
        if the output shunt-capacitance is about 470 uF, then the
        response appears
        to be largely limited to our own immediate group of galaxies.
        With lower
        values of output shunt-capacitance, i.e., a higher filter
        cut-off frequency,
        the response will include gravitational effects from deeper in
        space.
      </p>
      <p>Scalar fields of the gravitational type are generated profusely
        in the
        universe. The individual impulses of gravity gradients will be
        heard as
        a noise spectrum through an audio amplifier, or seen as grass on
        an oscilloscope.
        Figure 5 shows a simple audio amplifier that can be sued with
        the detector.
        The readily available LM386 IC has a gain of about 200. The
        author also
        used an audio amplifier available from Radio Shack (#277-1008)
        with good
        results.
      </p>

      </center>
      <p>Another simple gravity detector shown in Figure 6 uses a
        low-cost LM741
        op-amp. Here, the l/f noise is generated in a carbon composition
        resistive
        element rather than in a capacitative element. The current
        impulses developed
        in the resistor by gravity signals are also highly amplified and
        converted
        to voltage impulses y the op-amp. To facilitate the more
        critical adjustment
        of the Figure 6 circuit, both the input resistance and the
        feedback resistance
        are made variable. Input resistance R<sub>1</sub> is generally
        in the order
        of 100 to 200 ohms for most of the ICs tested. For optimum,
        results, the
        feedback resistance R<sub>2</sub> is generally in the order of
        1000 to
        10,000 times R<sub>1</sub>’s value. The experimenter should
        first adjust
        the input resistance to about 150 ohms, and then adjust the
        feedback resistance
        for maximum l/f noise response. Then, re-adjust the input
        resistance for
        optimum results.
      </p>
      <p>The output voltage from the gravity detector can be used to
        drive either
        a chart recorder, or fed to a DMM (Digital MultiMeter) and
        plotted. The
        detector’s output voltage varies quite slowly, with most
        observations taking
        several seconds or minutes to record.
      </p>
      <p><b>Gravity Communication</b>
      </p>
      <p>Present-day communication systems largely make use of the
        interaction
        of electric and magnetic flux fields in a vector type radiation
        field,
        i.e., electromagnetic waves, to convey information between
        distant points
        at the speed of light. Such systems range over the entire
        electromagnetic
        spectrum, from the very low frequencies (VLF) to the super high
        frequencies
        (SHF), reaching past the microwave frequencies and well into the
        optical
        range of frequencies. Such vector-type radiation fields have
        been extensively
        developed over the years and are in common use today. However,
        according
        to the author’s theories, scalar-type radiation fields, such as
        the gravitational
        field, might eventually be useful to convey information
        instantly.
      </p>
      <p>Scientists recognize the physical universe in basic terms such
        as mass,
        energy, fields, etc., and all else is but an integration of such
        factors.
        The author theorizes that gravitation has infinite wavelengths
        and are
        thus not wave-like. Moreover, gravitational impulses travel at
        Planck’s
        time interval of about 5.4 x 10<sup>-44</sup> seconds, and do
        not propagate
        at the speed of light --- a slow speed when compared to Planck’s
        time constant.
        The gravity impulse is a monopole and appears to travel almost
        instantaneously
        everywhere in the universe.
      </p>
      <p>Listening to the sounds of scalar gravity signals with an audio
        amplifier
        can be quite impressive. Adjust the amplifier’s sound level for
        best response
        to the particular sound being studied. Of particular interest
        may be some
        of the coherent musical sounds which appear to come from the
        same direction
        of space on a daily basis. At the author’s location of 42° N
        Latitude,
        those sounds appear to originate from the Perseus and Auriga
        regions of
        our Galaxy when those regions appear in the author’s zenith.
      </p>
      <p>Perhaps some of those signals might be ET intelligence signals,
        and
        experimenters interested in SETI (Search for Extra-Terrestrial
        Intelligence)
        might want to investigate that aspect of the detection process.
        Since gravity
        impulses travel everywhere almost instantaneously, communication
        between
        different galactic cultures would not be limited by the long
        time intervals
        required by speed-of-light communication by radio-wave.
      </p>
      <p>Man-made scalar flux signals are largely due to oscillating or
        rotating
        masses. A translation of mass will generate signals that are due
        to the
        perturbations of an apparent standing-wave pattern in the
        universe’s background
        radiation. That those modulations are truly due to mass in
        motion can be
        seen by oscillating a pendulum, or roiling a mass, which will
        disturb the
        gravitational background. The author has detected the
        oscillation of a
        pendulum 150 feet away that appeared to have the same response
        in detected
        intensity as when the pendulum was only 5 feet away. A local
        translation
        of mass will appear as a strong rushing sound in the detector’s
        audio output.
      </p>
      <p>As shown in Figure 7, an interesting pendulum experiment can be
        performed
        with a 2-pound weight that is suspended by a light-weight string
        from a
        height of 6 feet. Set the pendulum in motion with about a 5-foot
        arc length.
        Adjust the volume of the detector for a good response to the
        swinging disturbance
        of the vacuum, i.e., the universe. Even though the pendulum will
        eventually
        stop swinging, the disturbance in the universe continues to
        remain! That
        effect appears to be typical of gravitational perturbation in
        the universe.
        Apparently, once gravity disturbance is generated, the gravity
        impulses
        tend to propagate continually until dissipated or over-ridden in
        some way.
        It appears that gravitational communications will probably
        require some
        sort of modulation that can defeat the continuing propagation
        characteristics
        of the vacuum.

      <p><b>Gravity Astronomy</b>
      </p>
      <p>Astronomy, in recent years, has undergone a revolution in both
        theoretical
        considerations and observational methods. The revolution has not
        only opened
        new observational techniques at electromagnetic frequencies
        other than
        light, but has also given evidence that our universe, in its
        furthest reaches,
        also obeys the same scientific principles as those observed here
        on Earth.
        Among the new observational methods were attempts to detect
        gravitational
        signals. Such signals would be a new window into the universe,
        and would
        disclose many aspects not observable with the present day
        electromagnetic
        techniques.
      </p>
      <p>The astronomical gravity signal detection units are special
        modifications
        of the basic gravity detector. The modifications are: the input
        resonance
        frequency is normally kept much les than one hertz per second,
        additional
        amplification is used, and the output is passed through a low
        pass filter.
      </p>
      <p>The effectiveness of the capacitor element as a detector in
        gravity-signal
        astronomy is shown in Figure 8. The earth’s gravity field is in
        parallel
        with the polarized electric field in the planar capacitor
        dielectric. Furthermore,
        it can be shown that any gravity component arriving from other
        directions
        such as vectors a and b will be largely canceled because those
        vectors
        components are not parallel with the electric field in the
        capacitor, leading
        to reduced gravity components a' and b'. Only the gravity
        components arriving
        along a line through the observer’s meridian and the center of
        the earth
        will be most effective in exciting the capacitor element of the
        gravity
        detector.

      <p><b>Gravity Telescope</b>
      </p>
      <p>The gravity-signal detector sees the zenith of the observer’s
        celestial
        sphere through a very small aperture. That small aperture beam
        sweeps across
        the celestial sphere (at the observer’s latitude) at the rate of
        the Earth’s
        rotation. In that respect, the Earth’s rotation has a period of
        23 hours,
        56 minutes, 4.1 seconds of civil (ordinary) time, and that
        period is called
        a sidereal day.
      </p>
      <p>As shown in Figure 9, the Milky Way galaxy center as observed
        on the
        author’s meridian appears predictably about four minutes earlier
        each day
        with respect to civil (standard) time. Also note that another
        gravity event
        occurs 35 seconds before the galaxy center appears, which was
        used by the
        author as a marker. The author suggests that the chart
        recordings are gravity
        signals emitted from the Milky Way galaxy center, and not random
        electrical
        fluctuations that traditionalists call noise.

      <p>To locate astronomical objects, use a circular-type star
        finder, which
        is more generally known as a planisphere. The charts are
        calibrated for
        different Earth latitudes in standard (civil) times for each day
        of the
        years.
      </p>
      <p>The sky charts, or planispheres, are also calibrated in terms
        of right
        ascension and declination, so that objects may be located in
        terms of those
        parameters if they are known. For example, the galaxy center is
        known to
        be located in the Sagittarius constellation region in the
        southern hemisphere
        at about 17.7 hours right ascension and about –29° declination.
        Locating
        that spot on the meridian of the observer’s celestial sphere
        will enable
        the experimenter to use the planisphere to determine the day and
        time of
        day when the Milky Way galaxy center will appear there.
      </p>
      <p>The gravity detection process is shown in Figure 10 [Not
        available]
        for two common galactic gravity events. A supernova implosion
        will generate
        an oscillatory modulation of the g-field to an observer at
        position A.
        Black holes, on the other hand, will actually reduce the g-filed
        for an
        observer at position B. The effects of those cosmic events, and
        others,
        will now be considered in more detail.
      </p>
      <p><b>Galactic Events</b>
      </p>
      <p>A few of the more prominent galactic events will be briefly
        described
        to aid the experimenter in recognizing their signatures.
      </p>
      <p><i>Nova</i>: A nova is believed to be a star that ejects its
        outer layers
        in a violent explosion. As shown in Figure 11 [Not available],
        the large
        transit movement of mass creates two prominent features (or
        signatures)
        for that explosive event; the blast itself is then followed by
        the tailing
        of the blasted material as the gravity detector moves away due
        to the rotation
        of the Earth. A nova generally does not leave a lasting
        gravitational trace
        because the amount and density of the expelled material is not
        that great;
        although new nova explosions are commonly observed.
      </p>
      <p><i>Supernova</i>: A supernova is believed to be a star that
        exceeds
        a certain critical mass and then collapses to a small dense
        neutron star,
        or a black hole structure and, in that process, expels much of
        its gaseous
        material. The entire collapsing process, which occurs only in a
        few hundred
        milliseconds, is observable with the author’s gravity detector.
        As shown
        in Figure 12 [Not available], a plot of a supernova has certain
        prominent
        features. First, there is the actual collapse of the core of the
        star that
        generally appears as a sharp dip. The expulsion of the gaseous
        mass layer
        is now much more pronounced, which again gives rise to the
        tailing effect
        like the one of an ordinary nova. Supernova, however, also shows
        a mass
        build-up due to shock wave action, and that might appear as a
        bump in the
        tailing response.
      </p>
      <p><i>Black Hole</i>: A black hole type structure is generally
        developed
        by a very massive supernova event, and is usually developed 24
        to 48 hours
        after the event. An ancient black hole, as shown in Figure 13,
        appears
        as a rather deep gravity shadow of very narrow width (time of
        response)
        since it is rather small in size --- being only a few miles in
        diameter.

      <p><i>Galaxy Center</i>: The Milky Way center collectively
        generates a
        massive and predictable gravity response, as shown in Figure 14.

      <p><b>Solar System Events</b>
      </p>
      <p>Those who possess a strip chart recorder may wish to observe
        the planets
        that make up our solar system. The outer planets while massive
        are of low
        density and thus difficult to observe unless their exact time of
        transit
        on the observer’s meridian is known, and even then the results
        often are
        difficult to plot. The inner planets, while denser, must be
        observed in
        a background relatively free of other cosmic events. It is
        unfortunate,
        but the gravitational background of cosmic events tend to mask
        solar system
        gravity sources.
      </p>
      <p>Probably the easiest local astronomical body to observe will be
        our
        sun. It is located on the observer’s meridian at noon and at
        midnight.
        Using a low system gain, a typical scan of the Sun is shown in
        Figure 15.
        The twin peaks of the scan seen in the center of the scan seen
        in the center
        of the scan are believed to represent the nuclear core. The body
        of the
        sun is gaseous (low density), and thus, gravitationally
        transparent. The
        sun’s mass shows little differential from the averaged
        background level,
        except for the core, which shows an increase in density that
        measures about
        50 mV above the averaged background level of about 1.5 volts.

      <p>The Moon is not an interesting object gravitational observation
        because
        it’s difficult to detect against a background of gravity events
        that tend
        to mask the moon’s transit.
      </p>
      <p>To catch the planet Venus you must know the right ascension
        location
        for the day you want to scan. A scan for Venus is shown in
        Figure 16. It
        appears to indicate that Venus has a dense core.
