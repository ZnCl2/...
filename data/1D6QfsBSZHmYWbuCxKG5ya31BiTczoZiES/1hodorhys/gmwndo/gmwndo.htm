<p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Abstract:</font></b>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Described here is a very simple electronic-type
gravity meter (gravimeter) which can measure fluctuations in the earth’s
gravity field (g-field). These fluctuations, in turn, may be related to
cosmic effects of a gravitational nature. The author has developed many
such instruments over the past 15 years and has ‘observed’ many interesting
cosmic gravitational phenomena which appear to also affect the earth’s
gravitational field. Some of this data has been released in the past. In
recent years (and months) the gravimeters have noted some ‘catastrophic’
cosmic events which appeared to have a direct effect on the earth’s jet
stream patterns and thus also on the weather pattern on earth. The same
effects may have helped to initiate some of the recent earthquake activity
also. Some of these catastrophic events are briefly noted here. The author
hopes to increase the interest of the private experimenter-researcher in
these studies. The apparatus is very low in cost and simple and does not
require any expensive set-up. This area of investigation is yet quite unexplored
and thus wide open to the inquisitive and knowledgeable electronic experimenter
and amateur scientist.</font>
<p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Introduction:</font></b>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Gravity in terms of the author’s
rhysmonic cosmology theory (Ref 1) is a kinetic force, i.e., a Newtonian
force field gradient, which can directly affect material bodies. This force
is well known as the force of ‘free fall’ or the g-field of the earth,
i.e., it accelerates any mass at about 32 ft/sec<sup>2</sup> and thus makes
itself known as ‘weight’ on earth. Less well known is that these same gradients
can also affect certain structures in an electrical manner. In particular,
the ‘bound’ dipole structures in the dielectric of an ordinary capacitor
are affected by these gradients. These result in ‘polarization’ variations
which can be coupled out of the capacitor as electrical current impulses
and/or current levels. These impulses can be highly amplified to voltage
impulses (or voltage levels in the case of a ‘steady’ gradient force field)
using very simple circuitry.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">While the earth’s gravity field (g-field)
is a relatively constant gradient force field which is directed toward
the center of the earth, the author has long surmised and actually that
there would be fluctuations in these earth gravity gradients. These are
due to certain cosmic gravitational effects, such as the rapid and large
movement of mass, e.g., a supernova ‘blast’, or very dense concentrations
of mass, e.g., a ‘black hole’ type of structure. The rapid movement of
mass could be considered as causing a ‘shadow’ in the gradient. These effects
actually ‘modulate’ the earth’s g-field by superposition when the cosmic
gradients are directly in parallel with the earth’s gravity field gradient.
The field gradients in this case may be considered to be scalar fields
since they have a common direction and thus the potentials interact in
simple algebraic rules. This is particularly true of the cosmic gradient
arrives on earth from the direction of the gravimeter’s meridian location,
especially along the unit’s nadir line, i.e., the line running from the
zenith through the center of the earth. Thus the cosmic effects are most
pronounced when they ‘transit’ the observer’s meridian position, to use
the astronomer’s terminology. While the interaction is maximum only along
the nadir line, there is interaction from the cosmic gradients arriving
from anywhere along the meridian line. Thus some very strong cosmic gradients
off the nadir line may sometimes override weak nadir line gradients. This
was found useful in observing strong cosmic signals, e.g., the Milky Way
Galaxy Center, which lies well off the nadir line at the author’s latitude.
However, it must be remembered that detection response weakens with departure
from the nadir line since only the gradient component which is parallel
to the earth’s gradient will interact and thus modulate the earth’s gravity
field levels. However, the author has also developed a more complex gravity
‘telescope’ unit which improves the responses from various declination
positions along the observer’s meridian line.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">That such gravity gradient detections
are valid and useful, as well as meaningful, will be briefly considered
here. The reader is referred to the References for additional data and
information.</font>
<p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A Simple Electronic Gravimeter:</font></b>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The author (over the years) has developed
many types of gravimeters, some mechanical, but most electrical in nature.
The units varied from the extremely simple to the more complex, depending
on the particular components used and the end application. The unit shown
in <b><a href="#9a">Figure (1)</a></b> is a simple circuit (using generally
available parts) and was designed with this particular article in mind.
It was designed to measure the slow variations in the earth’s gravity field,
but also to demonstrate supernova ‘blasts’ in terms of an audio signal
as well as a display on an oscilloscope.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The unit was constructed on a small
plastic box about 1.5" x 2" x 5" which had an aluminum panel. A small 50
uA meter movement was used to display the averaged g-field levels and the
sensitivity and off-set controls were brought out on the panel as were
also the output jack and on/of switch. The 9-volt battery supply was also
self-contained within the plastic box.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The detection unit is a basic GW
detection circuit as developed by the author and uses the workhorse 741
operational amplifier (op-amp) device. Some slight revisions were included
to optimize the circuit for this particular application. The circuit is
the basic Quantum Non-Demolition (QND) type of circuit and thus will respond
to supernova ‘burst’ frequencies and amplitudes as well as the general
l/f noise background (which is generated by the multitude of GW signals
present in this universe). These signals are developed in the input capacitor,
C<sub>1</sub>, as current impulses and changed into output voltage signals
by the 741 device operated as a current-to-voltage converter. The ‘ring’
frequency and also the output voltage gain is controlled by the feedback
potentiometer resistance, R<sub>1</sub>. The circuit was placed in an ac
operating mode by off-setting the non-inverting input (pin 3) of the op-amp
device to approximately the midpoint of the nine-volt power supply. The
off-set positioning is provided by the resistance string of R<sub>2</sub>,
R<sub>3</sub>, and R<sub>4</sub>. Capacitor, C<sub>2</sub>, is used to
bypass the low-frequency components from the meter circuit, while capacitors,
C<sub>3</sub> and C<sub>4</sub> were intended to bypass possible RF components,
since the plastic box enclosure used does not fully protect against possible
RF interference signals. The meter, M<sub>1</sub>, is used directly between
the output and the non-inverting input as an approximately 50 mV voltmeter,
using only the internal resistance of the meter as a multiplier resistance.
The resistance of the meter used should be 1K or better. The typical voltage
output at this point is in the order of 30 mV, when the potentiometers
are set at their midpoint levels. The meter will respond only to the averaged
dc levels present at the output and not to any ac components. Thus, the
circuit parameters can be adjusted to have the meter read 32 on the meter
scale, this being equivalent to the typical g-field value of 32 ft/sec<sup>2</sup>.
While this response is linear and can be made accurate, unfortunately,
in this particular circuit, the g-field response is inverse, i.e., an increase
in the g-field will read down-scale, while a reduction in the g-field will
read up-scale. While this could be corrected with a following inverter
amplifier stage, it was deemed unnecessary. The averaged daily variation
in the g-field seen with this unit since about November 25, 1989 was in
the order of 6%, ranging between 31 and 33 ft/sec<sup>2</sup>!!! This larger
than usual variation will be discussed later.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The component values for this gravimeter
unit are not overly critical and the reader may use values in the order
of these shown, or even use quite different values. For example, the feedback
resistance could be a 2M or even a 5M potentiometer, while a 100K or even
a 200K potentiometer could be used for the off-set resistance string. Other
op-amps could also be used but may require some adjustment in the parameters.
Thus, the reader has much leeway in this design.</font>
<p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Cosmic Gravity Signals:</font></b>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Electronic gravity detectors are
capable of detecting many types of cosmic gravitational gradient signals,
depending on the design and the operating mode used. Only some of the more
common responses will be described here in order to help the researcher
recognize the mature of these signals. The gravimeter of <b><a href="#9a">Figure
(1)</a></b> was designed to detect only the highly averaged, i.e., relatively
constant, but slowly varying levels in the earth’s g-field, and these detections
will be discussed in the next section. Some single-stage op-amp detectors
can be made to respond to fast gravity changes, but generally two-stage
gravity detectors can be made more sensitive and thus will respond better
to the fast-changing earth gravity levels generated by the cosmic events
shown in <b><a href="#9b">Figure (2)</a></b>. These are novae, supernovae,
and the resulting ‘clack hole’ type structures in some cases.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A typical nova response is shown
in <b><a href="#9b">Figure (2a)</a></b>. The typical nova is a star which
becomes unstable for some reason and ‘blasts’ off a good portion of its
outer atmosphere, but still leaves a fairly large amount of star behind.
In <b><a href="#9b">Figure (2a)</a></b>, the blast of star material can
be at a and a ‘tailing’ response is seen at b. The tailing response is
generated by the process of the earth’s movement, as it pulls away from
the star, i.e., the observer’s meridian position moves off the meridian
position at which the star was located. Novae are quite common and many
are ‘observed’ during a ‘scan’ of the universe by the gravimeter. They
generally do not leave a lasting trace and thus may not show up in a scan
12 or 24 hours later.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Shown in <b><a href="#9b">Figure
(2b)</a></b> is a typical supernova response. In this case the star is
above a certain ‘critical’ mass when it becomes unstable, and it leads
to an ‘implosion’ causing the creation of a very dense star as is seen
at a here. This is followed by an ‘explosion’ of much of the star’s mass
as is seen at b. This is again followed by a tailing response as the detector
moves off the star’s meridian position with the rotation of the earth.
With a supernova, two other general effects are noted: the development
of the super dense star at c and signs of a shock front at d. Some supernovae
show signs of more than one shock front. Another factor is that supernova
generally show lasting traces. A scan 12 or 24 hours later will show the
dense star of a neutron star or black hole nature at c again, but the shock
front has now become an ‘accretion’ ring on both sides of the object at
c as is seen in the scan <b><a href="#9b">Figure (2c)</a></b>. Further
scans in time, generally show the accretion ring to be pulling away from
the central dense object and this results in a discernable gravity ‘wind’
from these events. In other scans, black hole structures are seen where
there is no sign of an accretion ring. These are believed to be ancient
supernovae where the accretion ring has either dissipated or returned to
the central dense object.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In many instances the ‘blasts’ of
mass create gravity ‘winds’ which not only can affect the gravity levels
on earth, but also can be ‘heard’ aurally on the detectors as an increased
rushing sound disturbance in the general l/f background noise of the universe.
The creation of the dense object, e.g., a black hole, cause a ‘shadow’
to appear in the earth’s g-field response, and thus appears as a very sharp
dip in the g-field levels, either a rise or fall, depending upon the object’s
position at the observing location, i.e., above or below the earth.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">While these responses are very common
occurrences seen with the very fast gravimeters, the slow highly averaged
gravity changes in the earth’s g-field also reveal much interesting information
about our universe as will be described next.</font>
<p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Gravity Field Revelations:</font></b>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The meter of the gravimeter circuit
of <b><a href="#9a">Figure (1)</a></b> displays only the highly averaged
(damped) g-field levels of the earth. While the meter will not display
the short-term fluctuations that were shown in <b><a href="#9b">Figure
(2)</a></b>, the long term fluctuations apparently show other interesting
aspects of our universe. A typical scan of these highly averaged g-field
variations (over a period of 24 hours) is shown in <b><a href="#9c">Figure
(3)</a></b>. In this scan some of the more rapid fluctuations have been
smoothed out and only the broad changes in the earth’s g-field levels are
shown.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">From the analysis of such scans,
the author has surmised the following conclusions:</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">1) The universe as a whole may have
a basic spiral structure quite similar to that of the Milky Way and Andromeda
Galaxies.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">2) The Milky Way Galaxy may be located
in an outer spiral of this Super Universe, very much like the earth is
located in an outer spiral arm of the Milky Way Galaxy.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">3) Just as the Milky Way Galaxy may
contain a massive ‘black hole’ type structure in its nucleus, so may the
Super Universe Galaxy, only it would be much more massive.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">4) There may be another very massive
‘black hole’ type structure located in the Virgo region of our universe,
and this may have already been recognized by many as the ‘Great Attractor’.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Since these are very massive and
dense structures, they possibly could affect our earth g-fields and thus
they are believed to be causing the structures seen in the scan of <b><a href="#9c">Figure
(3)</a></b>. It is further surmised that perhaps effects of these types
may have altered the earth’s g-fields to the extent o affecting the jet
stream patterns (and thus the earth’s weather) over the eons. It is offered
as another datum to be used in analyzing the weather on earth and possibly
all the planets. Some recent ‘drastic’ g-field variations noted with these
gravimeters are now presented:</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">1) On about December 6, 1986 it was
noted that the previously ‘seen’ Milky Way Galaxy structure had changed
from a weaker two massive dense structures to a more defined single ‘black
hole’ type structure with a new ‘accretion’ ring! At the same time, this
event appeared to have possibly ‘triggered off’ a supernova type event
relatively close to us (possibly Betelgeuse in Orion?) which lies on about
the same meridian as the Galaxy Center. It is surmised that the strong
gravity ‘winds’ from Betelgeuse (?) may have sufficiently disturbed out
earth g-fields to have caused severe changes in the earth’s weather for
the past two years (and it may have also been responsible for helping initiate
some of the recent earthquake activity seen in the northern hemisphere
and elsewhere.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">2) Another event was noted on about
March 14, 1987 which may have been from the Super Galaxy Center. As a result
of the December and march events, the gravimeters which had previously
only noted a daily variation in the earth’s g-field in the order of +/-
1% were now seeing variations of about +/- 2%. Also, strong gravity winds
were being noted in the aural responses of the gravimeters.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">3) On about November 25, 1989, a
new gravity wind was noticed and the gravimeters were now showing a daily
variation in the g-field of about +/1 3%! The winds appeared to be coming
from the direction of the Great Attractor in the Virgo Region. This apparently
very massive event appears to have affected the jet stream patterns of
the northern hemisphere mainly, and thus the weather patterns here. At
this time (New Years Day, 1990) the winds appear to be abating somewhat
and perhaps the weather may return to more normal later in the year. Based
on the apparent size of the jet stream disturbance, it is surmised that
the very dense structure in the Great Attractor region may be in the order
of 500 to 1000 miles in diameter. This area of investigation should be
of great interest to the meteorologists and thus more research into these
aspects should be made by them. The effects appear to be real and thus
of very great importance to mankind.</font>
<p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Conclusions:</font></b>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The many aspects of a possible new
gravitational ‘window’ to our universe requires more investigation than
one ‘observer’ with limited time and facilities (as well as funds) can
undertake. A few independent experimenter-researchers have entered these
studies at this time. The author hopes he has instilled sufficient interest
on the part of the private researcher to look further into these aspects
and thus help the author further determine the reality and validity of
these observations. Good experimenting to all!</font>
