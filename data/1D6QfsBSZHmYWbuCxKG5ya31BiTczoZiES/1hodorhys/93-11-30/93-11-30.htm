The
          lunar eclipse of 11-28-93 was visible here at Newark NJ from
          about
          11:40 pm to about 2:50 am, with totality occurring from about
          1:02 am to
          1:50 am. Since our GW detectors ‘look’ at but a small N-S
          segment of our
          zenith with the rotation of the earth, then at about 12:00
          midnight we
          would be seeing only a small portion of a partial eclipse in
          terms of gravitational
          effects. There would not be much change in the earth’s g-field
          since the
          moon and sun would be at opposite sides of our position on
          earth and these
          gravity effects would largely be nullified. However, past
          experience has
          shown that ‘near’ masses such as the earth, moon and sun would
          have a ‘filtering’
          effect on GW signal responses, i.e., they tend to ‘smooth out’
          some of
          the fluctuations seen in the GW responses. Thus, a scan was
          made during
          this eclipse with the hope of at least ‘seeing’ this smoothing
          effect.</font>

      <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><b>B.</b>&nbsp;
An
          estimate was made for the time the real sun would be on our
          zenith-nadir
          meridian line during this eclipse period. The mean sun, of
          course, is supposed
          to be on this line at 12:00 midnight (for my longitude).
          However, we must
          correct for the equation of time (at this time of year) which
          puts the
          real sun on this line at about 12:13 am. Again, correcting for
          the sun’s
          light travel time of about 8.3 minutes, we would expect the
          real sun to
          actually be on our meridian at about 12:04 to 12:05 am. Based
          upon the
          optical eclipse, a small portion of the moon is also on this
          earth-sun
          alignment. Thus, during the time period of 12:04-12:05 am we
          should expect
          to see some gravitational effects, e.g., some smoothing of GW
          signals.</font>

          To observe this possible effect, I used Circuit #300-B at the
          x10 range
          with low gain, a 4-diode offset, and a 1 Hz LP filter. The
          observations
          were recorded on a Rustrak chart recorder at a speed of 1/2
          inch per hour.
          At this low gain level, the chart response was about 1/16"
          thick trace
          with possibly 1/64" of scruff appearing above and below this
          more or less
          solid trace. The system was run overnight and the chart was
          inspected in
          the morning.</font>

          response
          is redrawn here (Figure 1). A copy of the actual chart does
          not always
          reveal the details seen in the originals. I am retaining the
          original for
          future reference.</font>

          Eclipses
          in terms of these GW detectors are "seen" only when the
          moon-sun-earth
          are all on the observer's meridian line. This eclipse was
          observed only
          as a very partial eclipse and thus only as a "smoothing out of
          scruff"
          with this partial alignment on this meridian. Even if better
          alignment
          was had, it would not be as impressive as a solar eclipse
          would have been.</font>

      <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">2.
          The
          gravitational interaction period appears to be only from about
          11:58 pm
          to 12:10 am.</font>

          A small
          white dot (indicating a dense mass) was also seen at about
          12:04-12:05
          am, somewhat south of my zenith-nadir line here. This could
          possibly be
          the sun's core, which could have been enhanced since it
          appears under the
          earth!</font>
