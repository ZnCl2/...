      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Present-day communications
          systems
          largely make use of vector type radiation fields, i.e.,
          electromagnetic
          waves, to convey information between distant points at the
          speed of light.
          Scalar type radiation fields, such as the gravitational field,
          however,
          might eventually be useful to convey information essentially
          ‘instantly’
          according to the author’s theories. With the development of
          very sensitive
          scalar type field detectors by the author, it is now possible
          to demonstrate
          some effects which appear to be attributable to such scalar
          fields. Several
          simple experiments which illustrate some of these points are
          described.
          These should provide a starting point for further experiments
          and investigations
          into these effects by the inquisitive experimenter and the
          open-minded
          private researcher.</font>

      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Introduction:</font></b>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A field in physics may be
          defined
          as a region in space which is under the influence of some
          ‘effect’, typically
          an electric, magnetic, or gravitational field. This field
          consists of interlocking
          closed loops of electric and magnetic lines of flux, and thus
          are vector
          type fields, as whirlpool fields. Such fields must therefore
          be described
          in terms of vectors, since a magnitude and direction is
          necessary to fully
          describe such fields. The theory of electromagnetism has been
          highly developed
          along these lines and thus is now useful in many aspects of
          high technology.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Less understood is the
          theory of
          fields which are conservative in nature and thus can be
          described in terms
          of magnitude alone. Such fields are called scalar fields. A
          common example
          of such a field is temperature, even though the gradient of
          such a scalar
          field will be vectorial. The gravitational field is also a
          scalar field
          and the gradients in this field are also vectorial. Less
          well-known are
          the conservative or scalar aspects of electric and magnetic
          fields. A scalar
          electric field is realized when the field is generated by the
          application
          of a voltage between two parallel plates, i.e., atypical
          parallel plate
          capacitor. An example of a ‘curl-free’ or scalar field
          (conservative) in
          magnetism is seen in the H-fields which emanate from the end
          of a bar magnet
          into the space just beyond it. Such a field is scalar for only
          a short
          distance, however,</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Scalar fields of the
          electric, magnetic
          and gravitational type have interesting properties compared to
          their vector
          field counterparts. For example, scalar fields easily
          penetrate ordinary
          matter, while the gradients of such fields can also interact
          with matter.
          The scalar fields emanating from the end of the bar magnet,
          for example,
          can easily penetrate a thick material mass, provided the mass
          is non-magnetic
          and thus cannot support induced fields which can counter the
          penetrating
          field components. Therefore, while these properties of scalar
          fields could
          provide a basis for a new communication system, proper
          methodology will
          have to be developed for the generation and detection of such
          signals before
          the system cold become viable. Effort and progress in these
          aspects are
          being made.</font>

      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Background:</font></b>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A major step forward in the
          possibility
          of effecting scalar signal communications has been made with
          the development
          of very sensitive scalar field detectors by the author (Ref.
          1) These detectors
          are presently being used in a wide range of applications by
          the author,
          including such facets as gravitational signal astronomy,
          gravity field
          measurements, l/f noise cancellation, Hooke’s Law type scale
          error-corrections,
          esoteric energy detection, and many other used. Discussed in
          this brief
          article will be the potential for using scalar fields, e.g.,
          gravitational
          fields, in possible methods for communication or signaling
          purposes.</font>

      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Scalar Field Detector:</font></b>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The scalar field detector
          used by
          the author in the experiments described in this article is
          very simple
          and is shown in <b><a href="#fig1">Figure (1)</a></b>. It
          is&nbsp; l/f
          noise type detector and uses a Cmos op-amp which operates with
          a 1.5 volt
          supply. The unit is assembled in an aluminum box with
          self-contained batteries
          and the output is brought out with a filter type feedthrough
          in order to
          eliminate possible response to RF type ambient signals.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Shown in <b><a href="#fig2">Figure
              (2)</a></b> is a simple audio amplifier which may be used
          with this detector.
          The readily available 386 IC has a gain of 200 times and
          provisions are
          made for headphone use also. Small telephone amplifiers or
          mini-amplifiers
          are commercially available which make suitable ready-built
          audio amplifiers.
          The author used a mini-amplifier available from Radio Shack
          (#277-1008)
          for these tests with good results. The headphone jack is
          desirable for
          headphone listening to the many scalar signal sounds generated
          naturally
          in the universe and/or by man. Headphone listening also
          facilitates the
          detection of some of the weaker scalar field effects to be
          noted in these
          experiments.</font>

      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Scalar fields of the
          gravitational
          type are generated profusely in the universe and are
          detectable with the
          simple circuit of <b><a href="#fig1">Figure (1)</a></b>. The
          unit will
          respond to the individual impulses of gravity gradients as a
          ‘noise spectrum’
          which can be heard with the audio amplifier or displayed as
          ‘grass’ on
          the oscilloscope. Careful listening to the audio signal
          response will also
          reveal, not only ‘noise’, but also some coherent response and
          ‘musical’
          tones as well. These will be considered later.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Man-made scalar
          gravitational signals
          are largely due to oscillating masses or rotating asymmetric
          masses. A
          translation of mass will also generate ‘signal’ which are due
          to perturbations
          of an apparent standing-wave pattern in the universe’s
          background radiation
          which is believed to have been created by the various
          processes in the
          universe. (Ref. 2)</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Local weak scalar signals of
          the
          ‘pure’ electric type or the ‘curl-free’ magnetic type may be
          generated
          with the circuits shown in <b><a href="#fig3">Figure (3)</a></b>.
          These
          signals have been detected at about 75 feet, the maximum lab
          distance available.
          However, they are at about the same level as the background
          radiation and
          thus are somewhat difficult to ascertain within the general
          background
          responses. The use of different pulse rates for these
          generators helps
          to properly identify the correct scalar signal. In general,
          low pulse rates
          must be used with these signals.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Scalar signals of the pure
          electric
          field type are generated mainly by charge impulses which are
          divorced from
          any accompanying magnetic components. The curl-free magnetic
          modes utilize
          parallel magnetic fields (H-fields) generated near the pole of
          a magnetic
          source field (in loose terms, a magnetic monopole). Scalar
          fields o the
          electric type can also be generated by special coil
          configurations in which
          the magnetic component (but not the electric components) is
          cancelled.
          These configurations are under consideration by the author.</font>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Listening to the sounds of
          scalar
          signals being detected by the detector of <b><a href="#fig1">Figure
              (1)</a></b>
          on headphones can be quite impressive. Adjust the amplifier
          sound level
          for best response to the particular sound being studied. Of
          particular
          interest are some of the ‘musical’ sounds which appear to come
          from the
          same points in our Galaxy on a daily basis. At the author’s
          location at
          about 42o N. latitude, these sounds seem to originate in the
          Perseus and
          Auriga regions of our galaxy. Perhaps some of these signals
          might be extraterrestrial
          intelligence signals, thus those experimenters interested in
          SETI (Search
          for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) may want to investigate
          this aspect
          of this detector.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The detector is also
          extremely sensitive
          to modulations of the ambient gravitational field by local
          mass translations
          (Ref. 2). The so-called microwave background radiation (MBR)
          appears to
          have a standing-wave pattern structure in the universe which
          has a ‘wavelength’
          of about 0.25 centimeter, corresponding to the 3o K black-body
          temperature
          for this radiation. The local translation of mass affects this
          structure
          as a rather intense perturbation which appears as a strong
          ‘rushing’ sound
          in the detector audio output. The experimenter may best
          observe this effect
          by slowly waving his arm back and forth at about a 1-2 Hz rate
          so as to
          establish a strong ‘resonance’ effect and then stops this
          movement at some
          peak swing. He will then note that this resonance effect will
          continue
          for many minutes, even hours, or until the coherent effect is
          destroyed
          by some other gravitational effect, such as your own beating
          heart, or
          by oscillating a mass, starting with large excursion which are
          then tapered
          down to a standstill. That these modulations are truly due to
          mass in motion,
          can be seen by oscillating a pendulum, or rolling a mass.
          These devices
          will disturb the vacuum, i.e., the gravitational background,
          independently
          of any human action. This effect will drop off with the square
          of the distance
          as with all scalar signals. The author has detected the
          oscillation of
          a pendulum 150 feet away which appeared to have the same
          response in detected
          intensity as when the pendulum was only 5 feet away.&nbsp;
          Therefore, such
          signals could have very extended ranges.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">An interesting experiment
          can be
          performed with this pendulum, which is a two pound weight
          suspended from
          a six foot height with a light weight string. Set the pendulum
          in motion
          with about a five foot arc length. Adjust the detector volume
          for a good
          response to this swinging disturbance of the vacuum, i.e., the
          universe.
          Now take the detector along in your car. Notice that the
          response remains
          about the same intensity even when the detector is inside the
          car. Now
          drive slowly to a distance of about one mile from the site of
          the pendulum.
          You will notice that the pendulum response will fall off with
          the distance
          (probably at the l/r<sup>2</sup> rate), but will still be
          noticeable at
          the one mile distance. As you return, you will notice that the
          response
          will continually increase in level and will have the original
          amplitude
          when you have returned to the site. However, most likely, the
          pendulum
          has stopped its oscillations by this time, but the disturbance
          in the universe
          remained! This effect appears to be typical of scalar signals
          or gravitational
          perturbations in this universe.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">There is one drawback,
          however. Scalar
          signals, once generated, tend to propagate continually until
          dissipated
          or over-ridden in some way. However, the perturbations can be
          encoded,
          e.g., if a gravity signal is pulsed at some rate, the pulse
          rate will be
          maintained. For example, if the 5 Hz LED scalar signal
          generator shown
          in <b><a href="#fig3">Figure (3)</a></b> is pulsed on every 5
          seconds,
          the gravitational field will be excited with 5 Hz pulses every
          5 seconds
          even if the original excitation has ceased. It appears that
          gravitational
          communications will probably require some sort of pulse-code
          modulation
          which can defeat the continuing propagation characteristics of
          the vacuum.
          The buzzer scalar source of the type shown in <b><a
              href="#fig3">Figure
              (3c)</a></b> can apparently do this to some extent. The
          strong desired
          scalar signals from the diode CR<sub>1</sub> appear to be
          followed by a
          ‘cancellation’ pulse, either from the scalar H-field shown,
          the g-field
          generated by the armature, or possibly some remaining E-field
          pulse at
          the breaker points. These fields may act in such a way that
          the desired
          ‘buzzing’ scalar signals are strongly transmitted, but they
          are not strongly
          repeated, i.e., the repeating pulses appear to be way, way
          down in level.
          Therefore, it was possible to transmit low speed Morse Code
          signals by
          these means. While some brief tests were made a ta distance of
          about 200
          feet, the range is probably much greater than that, even
          though a very
          low level (1.5 volt) buzzer source was used. Perhaps the early
          radio experimenters
          with their ‘spark gap’ induction coil transmitters were really
          using scalar
          ‘waves’ in addition to EM waves in their systems.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It is also interesting to
          note that
          it seems that maximum energy excitation takes place at about
          the 1-2 Hz
          rate. This appears to be a natural resonance frequency either
          as an earth
          resonance or as a universe resonance effect. Lightning stroke
          induced HV
          scalar signals also appear to be a good source for these very
          low frequency
          excitations (Ref. 3). There is room for much research here.</font>
      </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Psychic effects?</font></b>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">There are many sources for
          gravitational
          perturbation excitations at the local level. For example, a
          good 1-2 Hz
          resonance can be established by simply pressing the thumb and
          first finger
          together at this rate. When a good rate is established, cease
          the excitation
          with the fingers. The modulation will now continue at this
          same rate. Now
          think hard to slow down this rate: the rate will slow down!
          Relax and the
          rate will return to the original excitation! Are these psychic
          effects
          or are they a control of time? Or are they related to
          unconscious heart
          beats of muscle tensions as if nerve impulses are scalar in
          nature? I will
          leave it to the reader to perform the experiment and decide
          for himself.
          That these effects are apparently real is seen in that the
          experiment can
          be recorded on tape and stored.</font>

      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Conclusions</font></b>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A new area of scalar field
          research
          has been opened up due to the development of very sensitive
          field detectors
          by the author. The brief notes on some experiments given here
          are but the
          tip of the iceberg. There is room for much research and
          development in
          this area. The author hopes that dedicated experimenters and
          open-minded
          private researchers will enter this new field and contribute
          to the ‘new
          science’ now being investigated by just a few ‘pioneers’ in a
          potentially
          promising vast new field of endeavors.</font>
