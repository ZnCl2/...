      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The use of electromagnetic
          radiation
          to transmit or receive impulses or signals without the use of
          connecting
          wires or waveguides is so common today that we now have many
          terms which
          were ‘coined’ to describe a particular aspect of these
          communication systems.
          For example, the term radio incorporates systems which involve
          sound broadcasting,
          be it in commercial, military, amateur, or citizen band
          applications. The
          term television incorporates vision broadcasting, which today,
          while using
          electromagnetic radiation signals, is also using guided
          signals, primarily
          cables. Another common term is radar where the systems employ
          electromagnetic
          radiation for the purpose of locating, identifying, or guiding
          fixed door
          moving objects. The reader is also aware of the many
          specialized applications
          such as garage door openers, intrusion alarms, wireless
          telephones, etc.,
          as well as such sophisticated systems as those used in radio
          astronomy,
          for example. Therefore, with electromagnetic radiation signals
          so commonplace
          in our lives, perhaps the inquisitive reader or electronic
          experimenter
          has often wondered how exactly do these signals travel in
          space to reach
          us. It will be the purpose of this article to go beyond the
          usual (in simple
          fashion) of the actual basic mechanism underlying
          electromagnetic signal
          propagations.</font>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Electromagnetic radiation
          ‘effects’
          were probably noticed by many 19th century physicist and
          experimenters,
          notably Michael Faraday, theoretically predicted by James
          Clerk Maxwell,
          was finally conclusively generated and detected in the
          experiments of Heinrich
          Rudolf Hertz. Not much was done with these signals until
          Guliemo Marconi
          demonstrated in 1901 that long range communication using these
          signals
          was feasible. At this time the inquisitive and knowledgeable
          experimenter
          became involved and amateur radio as a hobby and avocation was
          born. These
          dedicated experimenters probably did more for the
          state-of-the-art of radio
          than any other group until the advent of World War II in 1939,
          when government
          and industry, out of necessity, teamed up to rapidly advance
          the state-of-the-art
          on all fronts. This effort was summarized in the well known
          MIT Radiation
          Laboratory Series of publications which were produced at the
          war’s end.
          While development work was continued since then, emphasis has
          been on the
          more practical aspects of communications rather than on
          studies of the
          basic mechanisms of electromagnetic wave propagation. This was
          the result
          of the theory of relativity and the new physics which did away
          with the
          classical view of an ‘aether’ which was hypothesized to be the
          ‘medium’
          in which wave propagation took place. Failure to detect his
          medium in a
          number of tests was cause enough to drop this medium as an
          unnecessary
          assumption and reliance put on the mathematical descriptions
          of the propagation
          process. However, the author in some original work in physics
          and cosmology
          (Ref. 1), has come up with a new approach to the basics of
          electromagnetic
          radiation which, in essence, restores an updated version of
          the aether
          as the fundamental constituent of the ‘vacuum’. A substratum
          particle which
          he calls a ‘rhysmon’ forms the very fabric of the universe in
          a structure
          in which particles, fields, and forces are but different
          manifestations
          of this structure. Some of these concepts, which are essential
          to any discussion
          of the propagation process, will be briefly presented here.
          Further details
          will be found in the reference cited above.</font>

      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The substratum, or the new
          aether
          of the vacuum, is a storehouse of energy provided by the
          extremely small
          spherical ‘objects’ called the rhysmons. The rhysmons are
          contained within
          individual ‘orbits’ and have energy equal to one Planck
          Constant quantum
          of action, h. Individual rhysmons intertwine with other
          rhysmons in a matrix
          structure as shown in planar form in<b><a href="#fig11">Figure
              (1)</a></b>.
          In this planar view it is seen that interweaving results in
          short directed
          rhysmonic vectors which now have energies of 2/h pi or h
          quantum of action.
          From this construction, one can define some additional
          parameters based
          on Planck’s Constant and his system of Natural Units (Ref. 2)
          There are
          further developed in Appendix I for reference. The complete
          matrix structure
          is shown in 3-dimensional form in <b><a href="#fig12">Figure
              (2)</a></b>.
          This basic cell is reminiscent of R. Buckminster Fuller’s
          (Ref. 3) vector
          equilibrium I that all directed energy vectors in the pure
          rhysmoid, i.e.,
          the undisturbed vacuum, cancel their energies and thus display
          no effects
          or phenomena which can be observable. The basic cell
          structures interlock
          with other cells to form the vacuum structure of the universe.
          This interlocking
          is depicted for an extended planar view in
          <b><a href="#fig13">Figure (3)</a></b>.
          Shown are the directed vectors as given in the single instant
          of time given
          by Planck Time, T*. In the next instant of time, T*, all the
          vectors reverse
          direction and then restore to the original direction in time,
          T*. As seen
          in <b><a href="#fig13">Figure (3)</a></b>, directed vectors
          join head-to-tail
          to form an ‘instantaneous’ vector which can span the universe.
          The instantaneous
          vectors are especially significant in the nature of
          gravitation. This simple
          interpretation of the structure of the universe forms the
          basis of rhysmonic
          cosmology (See Reference 1).</font>

          are for the vacuum
          state. Balance of forces in the vector equilibrium of the
          vacuum result
          in no phenomena, or effects, i.e., the vacuum is
          ‘unobservable’. For a
          ‘particle’ to be observed in the vacuum, the vacuum would have
          to be perturbated
          primarily as a change in density of the vacuum. This can be
          accomplished
          by a ‘tightened’ or a ‘loosened’ matrix structure of the form
          shown in
          <b><a href="#fig12">Figure
              (2)</a></b>. A tightened matrix structure would result in
          an increased
          density of rhsymons compared to the vacuum, and as a result
          there would
          be an excess of directed rhysmonic vectors leaving such a
          region. The dense
          region would be said to have a ‘positive charge’ and the
          excess out directed
          vectors would form the flux field known as the positive
          electric field
          of this entity. Therefore, rhysmonics gives reality to the
          flux lines of
          charged particles as imagined by Faraday, Maxwell, and the
          other classicists
          of the 19th century. The depiction of charge and electric
          fields in rhysmonics,
          shown in <b><a href="#fig14">Figure (4)</a></b>, is therefore
          pretty much
          as imagined by the classical physicists.</font>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It has been known since
          classical
          times that a moving charge will generate a magnetic field.
          This is because
          a particle which has charge, say an electron, in addition to a
          property
          called spin, has a new action called a magnetic moment. In
          rhsymonics,
          the electron is a ‘loosened’ spherical matrix structure in the
          vacuum,
          having a radius in the order of 10<sup>-13</sup> cm and an
          angular momentum
          of h/2, as determined by the classicists. Rhysmonics has also
          shown the
          electric field between unlike charges to be the result of the
          flux of directed
          rhysmonic vectors moving between a region of excess (positive
          charge or
          a source) to a region of deficiency (negative charge or a
          sink) as was
          shown in <b><a href="#fig14">Figure (4)</a></b>. Rhysmonics
          also shows
          that the magnetic field is due to an interaction of the excess
          vectors
          of the rotating charge region with the circumferential
          directed rhsymonic
          vectors surrounding the charge region as depicted in <b><a
              href="#fig15">Figure
              (5)</a></b>. Here the electron is shown to be ‘spinning’
          counterclockwise
          as it moves up and out of the paper. The excess directed
          vectors affect
          the circumferential vectors shown and thus cause a magnetic
          moment to be
          created. Thus the magnetic field is a closed loop of
          ‘rotating’ rhysmonic
          directed vectors, giving reality to the flux lines as imagined
          by faraday
          and the classicists, as well as that seen in the well known
          image formed
          by iron filings surrounding a current-carrying wire. Since the
          rhysmoncs
          are directed vectors, the flux line ‘flow’ is as was imagined
          by the classicists,
          i.e., that given by the right hand rule. From <b><a
              href="#fig15">Figure
              (5)</a></b> it can be shown (by Euclidian geometry) that
          the strength of
          the circumferential vectors, i.e., the magnetic field, will
          fall off inversely
          with the radius. The radial vectors, which formed the electric
          field flux
          lines, were shown to fall off inversely with the square of the
          radius.
          Thus, rhysmonics provides a logical explanation for the
          falling off of
          field strengths which have been determined from experiment.</font>
      </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Electromagnetic Fields</font></b>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Rhysmonics has also shown
          that a
          translation of a ‘particle’ in the vacuum required a ‘spin’
          for this process
          (See Ref. 1). However, if the particle has charge, i.e.,
          excess directed
          vectors, the translation must be accompanied with an
          additional interaction
          with the circumferential vectors surrounding this charged
          particle, as
          was discussed above. This rotational energy forms the entity
          known as the
          magnetic field. Therefore, a dynamic translation of ‘charge’,
          i.e., an
          electric field, must of necessity also create a dynamic
          movement of circumferential
          vectors, i.e., a magnetic field. Thus, under dynamic
          conditions, we cannot
          speak of only an electric field or a magnetic field, but of a
          dynamic electromagnetic
          field. It can be shown that this process is reversible, i.e.,
          a dynamic
          magnetic field, however created, must of necessity, also cause
          a translation
          of rhysmonic vectors, i.e., a movement of charge or an
          electric field.
          This is because the vacuum is a ‘perfect machine’ and the
          balance of forces
          requires these interactions (See Ref. 1).</font>

      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Wave Propagation</font></b>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A dynamic electromagnetic
          field has
          an additional interesting property in that the interacting
          fields result
          in a propagation effect in free space (the vacuum) which is
          known as an
          electromagnetic wave or EM radiation. A seldom-used
          illustration of this
          process is shown in <b><a href="#fig16">Figure (6a)</a></b>.
          This is the
          ‘chain link’ interpretation of EM wave propagation. Here the
          fields are
          depicted as closed loop vectors for not only the magnetic
          component, but
          also the electric component. The H-field loops are shown lying
          in the plane
          of the paper, while the E-field loops are shown directed into
          the paper
          at (+) and coming out of the paper at (-), thus completing
          this loop. The
          direction of propagation is seen to be at right angles to both
          these components.
          This closed loop interpretation of wave propagation indicates
          a quarter
          wavelength or 90o phase shift between the electric and
          magnetic components,
          which is not indicated in most depictions of EM wave
          propagation. This
          may be a necessary requirement of the directed vector
          construction of the
          vacuum of the universe. The loops are shown as circular in
          this depiction
          for illustrative purposes only. It should be noted that the
          depiction is
          symmetrical, i.e., the E-components can be interchanged with
          the H-components,
          and vice versa, without affecting the nature of this
          propagation. This
          symmetry is also apparent in Maxwell’s equations.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">When viewed under the
          substratum
          conditions of the rhysmonic matrix structure, this propagation
          process
          has some interesting consequences. As was seen in the planar
          view of circumferential
          vectors in the basic matrix structure of <b><a href="#fig11">Figure
              (1)</a></b>,
          the closest approach of any two adjacent parallel directed
          rhysmonic vectors
          is approximately two times the Planck Length, L*, equal to
          about 3.2 x
          10<sup>-33</sup> centimeters. Since the magnetic component in
          electromagnetic
          propagation is at right angles to the direction of
          propagation, and since
          curl or a rotational vector geometry is also involved,
          magnetic field reversal
          as seen in the depiction of <b><a href="#fig16">Figure (6a)</a></b>
          cannot
          take place closer than this closest approach of parallel
          rhysmonic vectors,
          or 2L*. This concept is clarified in the simplified sketch of
          <b><a href="#fig16">Figure
              (6b)</a></b>. Here the magnetic closed loop vectors (which
          are really the
          circumferential rhysmonic vectors) are shown, but the electric
          field vectors
          (which are really the radial rhysmonic vectors) are shown only
          by (+) where
          they enter the paper and (-) where they return out of the
          paper. Again,
          the magnetic rotational vectors cannot approach closer than
          the basic cell
          structure shown here. It should be noted that this basic cell
          could, in
          a broad sense, be considered as the ‘idler wheel’ imagined by
          Maxwell in
          is mechanical model of EM fields. Therefore, for each magnetic
          field reversal,
          i.e., each half wavelength of EM propagation, the wavelength
          must increase
          by this increment, 2L*, or 4L* per full wavelength. Since this
          increment
          is independent of wavelength, it is a linear factor and is
          also the observed
          Hubble Factor, but it should not be considered as a velocity
          factor. It
          should be remembered that E- and H-components may also be
          interchanged
          in this depiction. However, from symmetry, it is seen that the
          electric
          field component reversal also requires an increment of 4L* per
          wavelength.
          However, since both components are increased equally, the
          overall wave
          has a uniform expansion with wavelength of this same fixed
          amount of 4L*.
          Thus the longer EM waves travel in space, the more the
          wavelength increases.
          This process accounts for the so-called redshift in the
          spectra of distant
          galaxies.</font>

              href="#fig16">Figure
              (6)</a></b> are for EM propagation in the pure rhysmoid,
          i.e., the vacuum.
          Since the universe is like a cinema, with each frame in the
          cinema of existence
          lasting for Planck Time, T*, a rhysmonic field reversal, e.g.,
          the magnetic
          field reversal, must occur only after a new frame has begum,
          i.e, after
          this time interval of T* has passed. But also in this time
          interval a rhsymonic
          vector has moved or ‘jumped’ a distance of Planck Length, L*.
          Therefore,
          the translation of these rhysmonic ‘effects’ is Planck Length,
          L*, in Planck
          Time, T*, which gives a Planck Velocity, C*, or as is
          calculated out, C,
          the known velocity of light (or EM waves) in the vacuum! Since
          repeated
          rhsymonic field reversals occur during the electric and
          magnetic field
          generations, as well as in this propagation process, the
          velocity of propagation
          must be this constant L*/T*, and is thus dependent of
          wavelength (frequency)
          or other factors such as initial velocity or energy. The only
          way the velocity
          of propagation would change is if L* and T* change. This is
          possible in
          ‘matter’ where the matrix structure is tightened or loosened,
          or under
          conditions where space and time are ‘dilated’ as per
          relativity theory.</font>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The depiction of
          electromagnetic
          waves, thus far, has been on a fundamental mechanism basis. In
          practice,
          radio waves, in general, are initiated by antenna systems
          which are considerably
          larger than rhysmonic or atomic dimensions. Therefore, the
          overall radiative
          effects are definitely macroscopic in nature. For example,
          consider the
          simple dipole antenna system of <b><a href="#fig17">Figure
              (7a)</a></b>.
          The linear dimensions of such an antenna are in the order of
          one half the
          wavelength of the generated EM wave. The radiation is
          initiated by an ‘induction’
          field in the immediate region of the antenna, and is generally
          termed the
          ‘near field’. The radiated field is generated beyond about one
          wavelength
          in a delayed process due to the finite generation times for
          electric and
          magnetic fields. This mechanism may be found explained in most
          elementary
          texts on electromagnetic waves and will not be considered
          here. The important
          fact here is that the macroscopic nature of this wave
          generation results
          in an expanding spherical wave as depicted in <b><a
              href="#fig17">Figure
              (7a)</a></b>. The electric component, in planar form, is
          shown as arcs
          of increasing length with distance from the antenna. At great
          distances,
          the radiation may be considered to be a plane wave, for all
          practical purposes.
          To be useful for information purposes, the wave is ‘modulated’
          in some
          fashion, generally as pulse (code), amplitude (intensity), or
          as a frequency
          variation. In any event, these waves have all the
          characteristics of ‘waves’
          as defined in classical physics.</font>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">When the source of the
          radiation
          is from dipoles, say o atomic dimensions, the radiation will
          have different
          ‘characteristics’. Depicted in <b><a href="#fig17">Figure
              (7b)</a></b>
          is a simplified model of a hydrogen atom, which contains a
          single proton
          in the nucleus, and&nbsp; a single electron in ‘orbit’. When
          an energy
          change is made by the trapped electron, the sub-microscopic
          radiation released
          in this process is highly contained and may appear as depicted
          in <b><a href="#fig17">Figure
              (7b)</a></b>. the highly localized fields now have the
          ‘characteristics’
          of a localized ‘particle’, having both trapped energy and
          spin. This particle
          has been termed a photon and will exist as a short pulse of EM
          waves, perpetuated
          by the energy of the vacuum until dissipated in some fashion.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">However, if a stream of such
          ‘particles’
          is allowed to pass through a narrow slit, as shown in <b><a
              href="#fig17">Figure
              (7c)</a></b>, the coherent nature of this radiation (it is
          all generated
          in the same manner) can introduce other effects due to
          absorption and re-radiation
          from the slit edges, to create an apparent wavefront, i.e.,
          spherical and
          plane waves as depicted in <b><a href="#fig17">Figure (7c)</a></b>.
          Therefore,
          EM waves generates at the atomic dimensions are generally
          ‘particle’ in
          nature, or photons, while macroscopic effects, generated by
          many photons,
          or large radiating structures, are generally recognized as
          waves. Thus
          particles and waves are but different aspects of rhysmonic
          effects in the
          vacuum. The smaller the wavelength, the more particle-like the
          effects.</font>

      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Conclusions</font></b>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A brief introduction on the
          nature
          of electromagnetic wave propagation from the viewpoint of the
          author’s
          rhsymonic cosmology has been presented. Even this brief
          glimpse has developed
          a number of concepts which will just be mentioned here:</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">1) <u>The vacuum is a
            storehouse
            of potential energy and a perfect mechanical structure</u>
          which under
          undisturbed conditions is unobservable. However, the energy of
          the vacuum
          can be found useful under certain conditions. Three simple
          examples are
          given here:</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">a) <i>Electromagnetic wave
            propagation</i>:
          This has been the main subject of this article. In essence, EM
          waves, once
          initiated, would be perpetuated forever by the intrinsic
          energy of the
          vacuum. In practice, matter in the universe would affect and
          dissipate
          this process. Even in pure vacuum, the energy would eventually
          ‘dissipate’
          due to the increase in wavelength with tie of propagation.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">b) <i>Inertial effects</i>:
          Although
          not emphasized here, inertial effects are also the result of
          the perfect
          mechanical nature of the structure of the vacuum. Again, once
          inertial
          effects are initiated, they would also be perpetuated forever
          by the intrinsic
          energy of the vacuum. Examples are astronomical objects, space
          satellites,
          and closer to home, the simple flywheel. Dissipation in the
          latter case
          is primarily due to resisting forces such as gas molecules and
          friction.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">c) <i>Magnetic fields</i>:
          Since
          the magnetic field is a closed loop of rhysmonic energy, it
          should be possible,
          in principle, to ‘tap’ this energy and have it continuously
          replaced by
          the vacuum. Possibility of this approach has been partly
          confirmed by the
          author.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">2) <i>Nature of particles
            &amp; fields</i>:
          These are essentially perturbations of the pure vacuum. The
          important factor
          here is that the concepts of charges and fields, which were
          assumed by
          the classicists as aids in evaluating phenomena, are shown to
          have reality,
          i.e., these entities actually exist!</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">3) <i>Velocity of light</i>:
          The
          constant velocity of light (or EM waves) in the vacuum, which
          is only a
          postulate in relativity theory, is shown to be a necessary
          consequence
          in rhysmonics.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">4) <i>Redshift of spectra</i>:
          The
          so-called expansion of the universe has been called upon to
          explain this
          phenomenon. Rhysmonics shows redshift to be but a function of
          the propagation
          process and universe expansion is not required.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">5) <i>Phase shift</i>:
          Rhysmonic
          models appear to require a phase shift between the electric
          and magnetic
          components in EM wave propagation. This is not generally
          considered in
          most models of wave propagation.</font>
      </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Summary</font></b>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The author hopes that the
          curiosity
          of the inquisitive and knowledgeable electronic experimenter
          as to the
          actual physical nature of ‘radio’ propagation has been
          answered, at least
          in part, by this article. However, the author believes that
          there is much
          more to intrigue the serious experimenter. As mentioned in the
          introduction,
          experimenters have contributed much to the development of
          early radio.
          The present day experimenter should find this ‘new’ cosmology
          very fertile
          ground for new concepts and innovations. These would have both
          practical
          and technical value, and the experimenter would have the
          satisfaction of
          exploring new and virgin territory. The author hopes that many
          would opt
          to do so.</font>
