      <br>
      Anew financially viable and environmentally friendly way to
      recover and recycle gold from electronic waste has been outlined
      by scientists. With lower toxicity, cheaper cost and quicker
      extraction, the team has discovered an approach that could
      revolutionize the industry and be a veritable gold mine, so to
      speak. <br>
      <br>
      Foley, an associate professor in the Department of Chemistry,
      along with research associate Loghman Moradi and PhD student Hiwa
      Salimi, have discovered a new financially viable and
      environmentally friendly way to recover and recycle gold from
      electronic waste.<br>
      <br>
      "We've found a simple, cheap and environmentally benign solution
      that extracts gold in seconds, and can be recycled and reused,"
      said Foley. "This could change the gold industry."<br>
      <br>
      The biggest issue with gold is it is one of the least reactive
      chemical elements, making it difficult to dissolve, Foley
      explained. The common practice of mining for gold creates
      environmental issues because it requires large amounts of sodium
      cyanide. Meanwhile, recycling gold from electronic scraps like
      computer chips and circuits involves processes that are costly and
      have environmental implications.<br>
      <br>
      "The environmental effects of current practices can be
      devastating," said Foley, noting that the world produces more than
      50 million tons of electronic waste per year and 80 per cent of
      that winds up in landfills.<br>
      <br>
      What his U of S research team has discovered is a process using a
      solution -- <b>acetic acid combined with very small amounts of an
        oxidant and another acid </b>-- that extracts gold efficiently
      and effectively without the environmental concerns of current
      industry practices. In this technique, the gold extraction is done
      under mild conditions, while the solution dissolves gold at the
      fastest rate ever recorded.<br>
      <br>
      "Gold is stripped out from circuits in about 10 seconds, leaving
      the other metals intact," Foley said.<br>
      <br>
      Foley said it requires 5,000 litres of aqua regia to extract one
      kilogram of gold from printed circuit boards, none of which can be
      recycled. With the new U of S solution, one kilogram of gold can
      be extracted using only 100 litres of solution, all of which can
      be recycled over again. The overall cost of this solution is only
      50 cents a litre.<br>
      <br>
      With lower toxicity, cheaper cost and quicker extraction, Foley's
      team has discovered an approach that could revolutionize the
      industry and be a veritable gold mine, so to speak.<br>
      <br>
      The next step for Foley and his team is to move the process into
      large-scale applications for gold recycling.<br>

      <b>Abstract</b><br>
      <br>
      An extraction component enabling the concurrent recovery of gold
      and/or palladium selectively from a hydrochloric acid media
      containing the base metals and other contaminants. The disclosed
      extractant disclosed eliminates the conventional multi-step
      process for such extraction by providing for an extraction method
      which uses a single solvent extraction reagent. Further enhancing
      the conventional multi step process, the conventional scrubbing
      stage is eliminated by a single stripping stage. The resulting
      solutions can be obtained from leaching many types of material
      such as copper anode slimes, the treatment of scrap such as
      electronic circuit boards and plating effluents, PGM, or
      refractory gold ores.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>1. Field of the Invention</b><br>
      <br>
      This invention relates to a method and material employed for
      recovery of palladium and gold from base metals and impurities.
      More particularly it relates to a system and method employing a
      single novel extractant in a method allowing for extraction of
      palladium and gold from acidic media containing chloride ions.<br>
      <br>
      <b>2. Prior Art</b><br>
      <br>
      Throughout the world, for centuries, their has been a continuing
      demand for precious metals. In earlier times such was desirable
      for decorative purposes and as a means to store wealth of regents.
      More modernly, in addition to decorative purposes, precious metals
      are employed throughout the world in products such as electronics.
      With the ongoing metamorphosis of countries like China into high
      technology manufacturers and consumers, there continues to be an
      ever increasing industrial demand for precious metals. The
      increasing industrial use, and increased ownership by individuals
      and governments during current economic times, has driven the
      price for precious metals to historic highs.<br>
      <br>
      Mining of precious metals has become prohibitively costly and the
      minerals extracted by mining is unable to keep up with the
      logarithmic increase in demand. The above noted increased
      ownership and use, and the lessening supply from mined sources of
      precious metals, and the resulting high prices for such metals,
      has made the processes of recovering and refining these metals
      from other underused sources, potentially a very significant
      source, if they can be extracted and delivered at reasonable
      prices through refining and extracting of underutilized sources
      already existing.<br>
      <br>
      Copper anode slime is one of the major sources of the precious
      metals. Copper anode slime occurs in copious quantities during
      copper smelting. The anode slime collects at the bottom of
      conventional electrolytic copper refining cells. This anode slime
      contains significant quantities of platinum group metals
      especially platinum and palladium. The slime also contains
      significant quantities of gold, silver, aluminum, zinc, copper,
      arsenic, selenium, tellurium, nickel, and iron.<br>
      <br>
      Smelting firms are cognizant of the slime contents and
      conventionally employ a solvent extraction process to the anode
      slime to achieve a concentration, separation, and final extraction
      of precious metals by these large industrial companies. Despite
      simplicity and other advantages of solvent extraction process in
      precious metals recovery from copper anode slime, serious problems
      associated with the process exist which must be solved.<br>
      <br>
      Major impediments to the reagent used in such solvent extraction
      processes of precious metals exist in the recovery procedure,
      including extraction and stripping rate, extractant consumption,
      and selectivity. Two conventional extractants employed in this
      process include Dibutyl carbitol (DBC) and di-n-hexyl sulfide
      (DHS). These are employed as preferred extractants to yield gold
      and palladium respectively in the extraction process from sources
      such as copper anode slime. Prior art has sought to solve some of
      these problems without significant success.<br>
      <br>
      U.S. Pat. No. 7,291,202 describes the extraction of 1 mol gold
      from PGM concentrate by employing about 75 mol DBC. The extraction
      time using this quantity of DBC is taught at about 10 minutes. As
      taught in this patent, the extraction of gold with DBC from the
      subject material required five different stages. The process
      employed 2 stages for initial extraction, and three stages of
      scrubbing are then employed using 5 M hydrochloric acid solutions.
      This method involves problems, one of which is the large amount of
      extractant DBC used for extraction of gold for the ten minute time
      duration. Further, the taught method requires multi-steps for both
      extraction and for scrubbing stages. It is thus time consuming and
      expensive due to the amount of labor and extractant material that
      is used. Further, the conventional palladium extractant (DHS)
      taught for use for extraction of palladium to yield a molar ratio
      of 6:1 (DHS:Pd) requires no less than 3 hours of time. The '202
      patent describes that gold disturbs the extraction of palladium
      with DHS. Thus for extraction of palladium by DHS, gold must be
      removed at first because DHS cannot extract gold and/or palladium
      simultaneously. Consequently, there is a major drawback of DHS
      employed as an extractant since it yields a very low extraction
      kinetic and is time consuming.<br>
      <br>
      U.S. Pat. No. 5,284,633 teaches a new technique for separating of
      gold, palladium and platinum from the available material such as
      anode slime. This patent teaches the use of a single extractant,
      kelex 100, to be employed as the extraction reagent. However the
      '633 patent has some serious flaws also.<br>
      <br>
      First, using the method and extractant of the '633 patent, yields
      a low extraction of precious metals using a feed solution which is
      employed in a high volume. The extractant consumption for recovery
      of precious metals from the taught feed solution used of
      substantially 200 mol of kelex 100 yields only 1 mol of recovered
      precious metal. Using this 200:1 ratio, the extraction time takes
      at least 2 minutes. Further, because the employment of kekex 100
      also extracts iron to the organic phase at a taught ratio of 27%,
      it requires scrubbing and the scrubbing process in each stage
      eliminates a portion of the precious metals which are being
      recovered, from the organic phase (Au: 3%, Pt: 6% and Pd: 2%)
      thereby increasing cost from lower yields.<br>
      <br>
      U.S. Pat. No. 7,597,863 teaches the utilization of sulfur
      containing diamide agents for the extraction of palladium. In the
      '863 patent, it is taught that 200 mol the extractant must be
      employed to yield a recovery of 1 mol palladium. Using this costly
      200:1 ratio is especially time consuming as it lasts at least 10
      minutes. The '863 thus has some major disadvantages since it
      requires a very high consumption of the extractant for the low
      yield, and it uses a hydrochloric acid solution containing
      thiourea in the eventual stripping stage which is conventionally
      not considered suitable for practical widespread application. Due
      to some shortages of the ingredients of this and other above noted
      extractants, costs are increased and production slowed.<br>
      <br>
      As such, there exists an unmet need for a more effective and
      economical system employing a more practical reagent in the
      extraction of precious metals from sources such as copper anode
      slime and the like. Such a method should yield the highest amount
      of recovered precious metal with a significantly lower utilization
      of extractant than current systems. Finally, thus a system and
      extractant should significantly reduce the time needed for the
      process by the elimination of time-consuming scrubbing stages so
      that production may speed up and further lower costs by increasing
      valuable recovered precious metals using less labor and extractant
      material.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The noted shortcomings of the prior art are solved in the
      disclosed method and system herein. The disclosed method and used
      materials herein provide a procedure allowing for selective
      extraction and concentrating of gold and palladium from acidic
      solutions containing chloride ions. The system herein employs a
      solvent extraction process using the herein disclosed novel
      extractant. The disclosed extractant employs derivatives of
      dithiobiuret as a means to simultaneously extract gold and
      palladium from acidic solutions containing chloride and base metal
      ions derived from leaching of ores, catalysts, anode slimes or
      other such materials containing precious metals. The process is
      further enhanced because it allows for a loaded organic phase
      during the recover without a scrubbing stage. This one step
      process using a single solvent extraction reagent requiring only a
      single stripping stage eliminates the need for a costly scrubbing
      stage.<br>
      <br>
      As will be seen in this disclosure, a number of improvements in
      the process itself and the extractant are provided by the
      disclosed method and extractant. Of particular note, the disclosed
      extractant is very selective for extraction of gold and palladium
      even when employed in the presence of contaminants. Thus the high
      percentage of extraction of gold and palladium (about 99.9%) can
      be achieved in one stage.<br>
      <br>
      Also of note, the extraction kinetic of palladium and gold by
      utilizing disclosed extractant is much faster than conventional
      methods and works I substantially two minutes in many cases. This
      exceeds in the conventional DRS commercial extractant for
      extraction of palladium which has an extraction time of 180
      minutes. Thus the extraction of gold and palladium with the
      disclosed extractant enabling the disclosed method is time and
      energy saving.<br>
      <br>
      Further, the disclosed extractant can extract both gold and
      palladium simultaneously. This eliminates the conventional need to
      utilize different extractants separately for the respective metals
      and reduces the cost of metal recovery process.<br>
      <br>
      Still further, due to a high selectivity of the disclosed
      extractant, the process does not require the conventional
      scrubbing stage. This results in significant monetary savings for
      energy and ecological benefits. Additionally ecologically
      beneficial is the fact that the disclosed extractant is very
      stable in extraction conditions and thus it can be re employed
      many times without significant loss of extraction ability.<br>
      <br>
      Also, a high concentration of gold and palladium can be achieved
      in the organic phase without utilizing any modifier as is required
      conventionally. Because of high selectivity and high loading
      capacity the disclosed extractant can be employed in single batch
      method at an aqueous to organic ratio of 6:1 instead of multi-step
      counter-current contacts of conventional methods. Thus the amount
      of solvent used in the disclosed system is substantially less than
      systems using conventional solvent extractants.<br>
      <br>
      Especially attractive to many countries and firms not having high
      technical expertise is the fact that the synthesis of the
      disclosed extractant is simple and the cost of synthesis process
      is very low, versus conventional commercial extractants (DRS and
      DBC). As such, due to aforementioned advantages of the disclosed
      extractant and resulting method, a significant improvement is
      yielded in both economic considerations, and economy, and it has
      the potential to revolutionize the industry of precious metals
      recovery.<br>
      <br>
      With respect to the above description, it is to be understood that
      the invention and method herein, is not limited in its application
      to the details of construction and to the arrangement of the
      components in this specification or illustrated in the drawings
      showing metals extraction method herein. The disclosed method
      herein described and extractant disclosed, provides a novel one
      step precious metals recovery system, is capable of other
      embodiments and of being practiced and carried out in various ways
      which will be obvious to those skilled in the art upon reading
      this disclosure. Also, it is to be understood that the phraseology
      and terminology employed herein are for the purpose of description
      and should not be regarded as limiting.<br>
      <br>
      As such, those skilled in the art will appreciate that the
      conception upon which this disclosure is based may readily be
      utilized as a basis for designing of other improved precious metal
      extraction processes. It is important, therefore, that the claims
      and disclosure herein be regarded as including any such equivalent
      construction and methodology insofar as they do not depart from
      the spirit of the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      It is an object of this invention to provide a method and means
      for precious metal extraction which conserves time and yields
      increased production of precious metals.<br>
      <br>
      An additional object of this invention is the provision of a
      precious metals extraction system and a metals extraction process
      which allows for a loaded organic phase during the recovery
      without a scrubbing stage.<br>
      <br>
      Yet another object of this invention is the provision of a metals
      extraction process which is a one step process using a single
      solvent extraction reagent and only requiring only a single
      stripping stage.<br>
      <br>
      These together with other objects and advantages which become
      subsequently apparent, reside in the details of the construction
      and operation as herein described with reference being had to the
      accompanying drawings forming a part thereof, wherein like

      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS OF THE
        INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      As disclosed herein the novel extraction component disclosed and
      described herein, enables a method of recovering gold and
      palladium selectively from hydrochloric acid media containing base
      metals and other contaminants. The novel extractant disclosed
      provides for a time and labor saving method which uses a single
      solvent extraction reagent. Further enhancing the conventional
      multi step process, only a single stripping stage is required
      wherein the scrubbing stage of conventional processing is
      eliminated as it is not required.<br>
      <br>
      The extracting agents disclosed, employed by method disclosed in
      this invention, can form considerably stronger complexes with the
      gold and palladium than with base metals. The acidic solution
      containing chloride ion can be achieved by leaching a material
      which includes the desired precious metals, by adding an acid
      containing an oxidizing agent. The resulting solutions can be
      obtained from leaching many types of material such as copper anode
      slimes; treatment of scrap such as electronic circuit boards;
      plating effluents, PGM or refractory gold ores.<br>
      <br>
      Copper anode slimes conventionally contain varying quantities
      precious metals such as gold, platinum, palladium and silver.
      Other contents includes copper, selenium, tellurium, lead,
      arsenic, antimony, nickel, iron, cobalt, barium, aluminum, zinc,
      etc.<br>
      <br>
      In the precious metals recovery process herein disclosed employing
      the disclosed novel extracting agent with an anode slime, the
      process includes in a first stage of leaching the copper anode
      slime with nitric acid 8-10 M (2 times) for about 2 hours at 85°
      C., or till a solute is reached at least about 95% by weight of
      the silver content and efficient oxidization of precious metals,
      in hydrochloric acid leaching stage. Next, the leaching residue is
      separated from the lechate.<br>
      <br>
      After separating the leaching residue from the lechate, the
      leaching residue is leached by mixture of hydrochloric acid and
      hydrogen peroxide to form a slurry. This slurry so formed, is then
      filtered to separate a leaching residue from a desirable leachate
      containing gold, platinum, palladium and other base metals.
      Oxidizing is then accomplished employing one or a combination of
      different oxidizing agents such as chlorine, perchlorate,
      permanganate, hydrogen peroxide etc. The use of HCl as the
      leaching solution and H2O2 as the oxidizing agent is preferred.<br>
      <br>
      Following this adjustment step of the liquid characteristics of
      the leachate, a solvent extraction step is employed using the
      disclosed novel extractant herein. This extraction step is
      employed to extract gold and palladium from the leachate. The
      resulting loaded organic is then stripped with acidified thiourea
      solution, without the need for the conventional scrubbing stage of
      conventional extraction methods. This stripping yields a
      substantially yellow precipitate containing palladium along with a
      solution containing gold free of base metals which is obtained.<br>
      <br>
      In this method, palladium is selectively separated from gold in a
      stripping stage without the need to use conventional multiple
      reagents. As described above, extraction of the precious metals by
      the method herein enabled by the disclosed novel extractant, thus
      is very time and energy saving.<br>
      <br>
      One important enhanced feature of the present invention is that
      the employment of the disclosed extracting agent eliminates all of
      the impurities in the extracting stage without using scrubbing
      process. Palladium and gold are thus extracted concurrently from
      this acidic feed solution by using the single disclosed extractant
      instead of a plurality of extractants in the conventional mode of
      the extraction process.<br>
      <br>
      Still further, the disclosed extractant is reusable at least 15
      times after the striping stage. It thus may be employed for
      subsequent extraction of the precious metals from new feed
      liquors, without damaging and decreasing power of extraction
      method herein.<br>
      <br>
      In solvent extraction techniques, single batch extraction and high
      loading capacity of the extractant have important roles. The
      results obtained from example 8, disclose that the organic phase
      employing the disclosed extractant herein, in the absence of any
      modifiers, can be extremely loaded with precious metals in a
      single batch process without the solvent becoming viscose.
      Consequently, the solvent consumption in the disclosed method
      employing the novel extractant, uses significantly less solvent
      and extractant than conventional methods.<br>
      <br>
      The disclosed extracting agent used in present invention and
      method, is a new derivative of<b> dithiobiuret</b> having
      substantially the following formula:<br>
      <br>
      <div align="center"><img alt="" src="US08663584-1.png"
          height="188" width="354"><br>
      </div>
      &nbsp;<br>
      In the above formula, R is cyclohexyl or isopropyl and Z
      represents a group consist of —CH2-, —CH2-CH2-, CH2-CH2-CH2,
      CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2, CH2(CH2)2CH2, CH2-NH—CH2-, CH2-CHOH—CH2-,
      CHOH—CH2-CH2-, —CH2-O—CH2-.<br>
      <br>
      More importantly, this extracting agents introduced herein are
      able to form very stable chelates with gold and palladium which
      eliminates the base metal contaminants in the conventional solvent
      extraction process without needing to scrubbing step before
      stripping stage. Then in the stripping stage, the said precious
      metals are selectively recovered utilizing an acidified thiourea
      solution. The organic solvents that can be used in this process
      are including of polar hydrocarbon solvents such as
      dichloromethane, dichloroethane, chloroform, esters such as ethyl
      acetate, chlorobenzene and 1,2 dichlorobenzene etc.<br>
      <br>
      The acidified thiourea solution used in this process can have an
      acid concentration of from about 0.5-2 M, more preferably from
      about 0.5-1 M of HCl, HNO3, H2SO4, that the sulfuric acid is
      preferred. Additionally, the acidified thiourea solution may
      contain from about substantially 0.3-1M of thiourea, such that the
      concentration of 0.7 mol of thiourea is preferably achieved.<br>
      <br>
      Utilizing of acidified thiourea for stripping of precious metals
      from the dithiobiuret complex doesn't damage the organic phase in
      contrast to other conventional stripping methods taught reported
      in the prior arts such as hydrolytic or direct hydrogen reduction.
      The disclosed herein, single solvent extraction process which is
      combined with a single stripping stage and recycling of extractant
      several times will thus provide a means to decrease the total cost
      of precious metal recovery. Furthermore, the strip solutions
      obtained by this process can be treated chemically to recover gold
      by electrolyze or reduced with hydrogen or sodium borohydride to
      produce gold powders.<br>
      <br>
      The following examples are given to illustrate the employment of
      the method and extractant disclosed in the invention herein.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 1</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Typical procedure for preparation of the preferred novel
      extractant: The 0.55 kg of CS2 was added in small portions over a
      period of about 1 hour to a mixture of 0.48 kg morpholine amine
      and 1 kg dicyclohexyl carbodiimide (DCC) in 6 L of methanol at 10°
      C. or less. The reaction mixture was stirred for 4 hours. When the
      reaction was completed, the precipitated solid was removed by
      filtration and washed with water two times. This product is easily
      recrystallized from methanol. This reaction can be carried out in
      water or solvent free conditions too.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 2</b><b><br>

      0.5 M hydrochloric acid solution containing 2000 ppm gold in form
      of gold chloride (AuCl4-). After a contact time of 90 sec the
      phases were allowed to separate. After extraction, the aqueous
      phase is analyzed by AAS (Atomic Absorbance Spectroscopy). Based
      on AAS data, the remained gold in aqueous phase was about 0.6 ppm.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 3</b><b><br>

      <br>
      Table 1 shows that gold and palladium are extracted selectively in
      to organic phase. The platinum and other base metals remain almost
      completely in the raffinate.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 5</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      0.5 L of loaded organic phase containing 2000 ppm gold earned from
      example 2 was contacted with equal volume of 0.5 M thiourea
      solution containing 98 gpl sulfuric acid for 5 minutes at room
      temperature. The earned analysis data showed complete stripping of
      gold.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 6</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      0.5 of loaded organic phase containing 2000 ppm palladium earned
      from example 3 was contacted with equal volume of 0.5 M thiourea
      solution containing 98 gpl sulfuric acid for 5 minutes at room
      temperature. After stripping a yellow precipitate was obtained.
      The palladium powder was recovered by calcining the yellow
      precipitate at 850° C. for 2 hours.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 7</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      1 L of organic solution containing 3 g of novel extractant said in
      example 1, in dichloromethane, was contacted vigorously with an
      equal volume of 0.5 M hydrochloric acid solution containing 1000
      ppm gold in form of gold chloride (AuCl4-). After a contact time
      of 2 minutes the phases were allowed to separate. The loaded
      organic phase was contacted with equal volume of 0.5 M thiourea
      solution containing 98 gpl sulfuric acid for 5 minute, and after
      separation of two phases, the organic phase was resent for
      extraction of gold from a new aqueous feed solution, and this
      procedure was repeated for 15 times. Analysis of final raffinate
      solution with AAS showed that the remained gold in aqueous phase
      is about 8 ppm.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 8 <br>
        <br>
        Loading Capacity</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      1.2 L of a 1 M hydrochloric acid solution contain 13500 ppm
      palladium in form of palladium chloride (PdCl4-2) was contacted
      with a 0.2 L dichloromethane containing 80 g of new extractant
      said in example 1. After a contact time of 3 minutes the phases
      were allowed to separate. Aqueous phase analyses showed almost
      completely extraction of palladium in to organic phase. So
      extremely high concentration of palladium can be extracted in to
      the organic phase without the solvent becoming immoderately
      viscous and a single batch extraction can be used for efficient
      extraction instead of multi-step counter-current contacts.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 9</b><b><br>

      ppm for iron, 450 ppm for nickel, 9100 ppm for arsenic, 80300 ppm
      for selenium, 9500 ppm for tellurium, 60000 ppm for silver, 10000

      and 0.7 L of water, 0.5 L of hydrogen peroxide was added gradually
      to the mixture and the temperature of the liquid was maintained at
      70° C. for 4 hours to effect oxidizing leaching. Following
      cooling, the chlorination leaching residue was filtered. The
      respective concentration levels within leach liquor were 1250 ppm
      for gold, 50 ppm for palladium, and containing very high levels of
      other impurities. The acid concentration of the filtrate was
      adjusted to 1 M or less, and lead and silver was precipitated and
      separated from leach liquor. Then filtrate was mixed with equal
      volume of dichloromethane containing 35 g new extractant said in
      example 1. Then the mixture allowed stirring for 20 minutes
      vigorously at room temperature. The two phases were separated and
      the respective concentration levels with in the raffinate solution
      were 0.7 ppm for gold and 0.6 ppm for palladium. The resulting
      data obviously shows almost completely extraction of gold and
      palladium from copper anode slime.<br>

        Abstract<br>
      </b>The invention relates to the use of a single solvent
      extraction reagent which greatly simplifies the recovery of
      platinum, palladium and gold from base metal-containing solutions.
      The recovery of platinum, palladium and gold from acidic feed
      solutions which contain chloride ion is accomplished by first
      using a substituted 8-hydroxyquinoline reagent or a derivative
      thereof for extraction wherein a chelate is formed between the
      reagent and the precious metals. The chelated product is
      sufficiently stable to allow any base metals or complexes thereof
      to be scrubbed from the organic phase. The precious metal values
      are then recovered from the reagent by stripping with acidified

      and R2 each represent a group selected from a chain hydrocarbon
      group having 1 to 18 carbon atoms which may be branched, an
      alicyclic hydrocarbon group having 1 to 10 carbon atoms, and an
      aromatic hydrocarbon group having 1 to 14 carbon atom, and R3
      represents a group represented by {(CH2)nS(CH2)m}L in which n, m
      and L each represent an integer of from 1 to 4; extracting

          Electronics Recycling</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Recycling and reusing electronic components could be made much
      easier with a new polymer that produces a circuit board that will
      dissolve when immersed in hot water. The circuit board was
      developed by the UK’s National Physical Laboratory (NPL) as part
      of the ReUSE (Reuseable, Unzippable, Sustainable Electronics)
      project.<br>
      <br>
      The circuit board material is hardy enough to withstand ordinary
      heat and moisture, but full immersion in hot water acts to release
      the components from the board. This allows for over 90% of the
      electronics materials to be recovered, whereas typically less than
      2% of the materials on a circuit board are re-used.<br>
      <br>
      Although this is not necessarily beneficial for the repairability
      of electronics, it could be a definite improvement in helping get
      a handle on the growing mountains of electronics waste and make
      recycling of electronics components and recovery of minerals an
      easier process.<br>
