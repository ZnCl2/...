      <br>
      To one who is neither an engineer nor an economist, the relation
      of the depression to thermodynamics is not exactly as clear as
      hell. But to Dr. H.C. Dickinson of the Bureau of Standards, who is
      both an engineer and a student of economics, there is little
      difference, so far as methods of analysis are concerned, between
      finding out what is wrong with the business world and with a
      system which is intended to convert the heat of fuel into
      mechanical work. Reduce the economic model to a working model and
      you will see at once just why and when it is morking efficiently
      and inefficiently.<br>
      <br>
      When he wasn't testing automotive engines at the Bureau of
      Standards, Dr Dickinson was devising such a machine at home. He
      calls it an "Economonstrator" and talks about it now and then
      before engineering societies. It is well to add that he has no
      desire to become a member of the Brain Trust or to induce the
      country to adopt some view of money or business peculiarly his
      own. Engineer that he is, his one concern is to show how the
      forces, now working with one another and how against one another
      may be visualized, so that anyone of intelligence can see for
      himself how our economic system works.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Five Economic Factors</b><br>
      <br>
      Dickinson considers (1) products of labor which are distributed
      for consumption, (2) property for use, such as personal property
      owned outright, (3) capital goods entended to increase production
      and wealth, (4) debts on which interest must be paid, and (5)
      natural resources. The accompanying diagram, which is simpler than
      it looks, shows clearly how the economonstrator juggles these five
      to visualize any economic situation.<br>
      <br>
      Money having a fixed value in terms of a fixed standard is
      Dickinson's mesure of value for all salable products. he makes it
      flow, symbolically, in the form of dyed water through a system of
      pipes and reservoirs, all neatly balanced like a see-saw. Keep the
      see-saw in equilibrium and all is well. Let it tilt to one side
      and you have over-prosperity&nbsp; and the reason why...<br>
      <br>
      ... below that paid for old loans. You also see these old loans
      (bonds) selling above par.<br>
      <br>
      Instead of being discouraged, the economonstrator shows the
      thrifty man actually spurred on. He makes an immediate apparent
      profit because his bonds sell above par. Out of this flows the
      conclusion that a tendency to oversave leads to a
      speculation&nbsp; with profits -- a condition revealed when the
      level in Tank 3 rises rapidly. Dickinson thinks that classical
      economists have generally overlooked this vital fact.<br>
      <br>
      Take our present situation. Tank 4 is full, meaning that excessive
      debt has accumulated. Take 1 (payrolls) must be pumped full as
      rapidly as possible or Tank 4 (debts) must be emptied. The
      Administration finds that both procedures are necessary -- the
      extreme case. So we see the government putting more men at work
      and increasing ...<br>

      <br>
      To demonsrate the forces that bring about prosperity or
      depression, Dr H&nbsp; Dickinson, engineer connected with the US
      Bureau of Standards, has devised a curious machine that he calls
      an "Economonstrator". With its aid, he declares, the entire
      economocs of a nation's rise and fall can be explained
      graphically. Two tiny electric pumps circulate colored liquid
      through glass tubes, representing channels through which
      commodities change hands and connecting sources of supply and
      consumption. When the flow is interrupted by closing valves at
      various significant points, the pivoted platform tilts, and the
      shifting liquid shows just how the whole economic system is thrown
      out of balance. This is done by measuring reservoirs that
      represent economic activities.<br>
