      </b>[ Nanoparticles (purple) carrying melittin (green) fuse with
      HIV (small circles with spiked outer ring), destroying the virus’s
      protective envelope. Molecular bumpers (small red ovals) prevent
      the nanoparticles from harming the body’s normal cells, which are
      much larger in size. ]<br>
      <br>
      Nanoparticles carrying a toxin found in bee venom can destroy
      human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) while leaving surrounding cells
      unharmed, researchers at Washington University School of Medicine
      in St. Louis have shown. The finding is an important step toward
      developing a vaginal gel that may prevent the spread of HIV, the
      virus that causes AIDS.<br>
      <br>
      “Our hope is that in places where HIV is running rampant, people
      could use this gel as a preventive measure to stop the initial
      infection,” says Joshua L. Hood, MD, PhD, a research instructor in
      medicine.<br>
      <br>
      The study appears in the current issue of Antiviral Therapy.<br>
      <br>
      Bee venom contains a potent toxin called melittin that can poke
      holes in the protective envelope that surrounds HIV, and other
      viruses. Large amounts of free melittin can cause a lot of damage.
      Indeed, in addition to anti-viral therapy, the paper’s senior
      author, Samuel A. Wickline, MD, the J. Russell Hornsby Professor
      of Biomedical Sciences, has shown melittin-loaded nanoparticles to
      be effective in killing tumor cells.<br>
      <br>
      The new study shows that melittin loaded onto these nanoparticles
      does not harm normal cells. That’s because Hood added protective
      bumpers to the nanoparticle surface. When the nanoparticles come
      into contact with normal cells, which are much larger in size, the
      particles simply bounce off. HIV, on the other hand, is even
      smaller than the nanoparticle, so HIV fits between the bumpers and
      makes contact with the surface of the nanoparticle, where the bee
      toxin awaits.<br>
      <br>
      “Melittin on the nanoparticles fuses with the viral envelope,”
      Hood says. “The melittin forms little pore-like attack complexes
      and ruptures the envelope, stripping it off the virus.”<br>
      <br>
      According to Hood, an advantage of this approach is that the
      nanoparticle attacks an essential part of the virus’ structure. In
      contrast, most anti-HIV drugs inhibit the virus’s ability to
      replicate. But this anti-replication strategy does nothing to stop
      initial infection, and some strains of the virus have found ways
      around these drugs and reproduce anyway.<br>
      <br>
      “We are attacking an inherent physical property of HIV,” Hood
      says. “Theoretically, there isn’t any way for the virus to adapt
      to that. The virus has to have a protective coat, a double-layered
      membrane that covers the virus.”<br>
      <br>
      Beyond prevention in the form of a vaginal gel, Hood also sees
      potential for using nanoparticles with melittin as therapy for
      existing HIV infections, especially those that are drug-resistant.
      The nanoparticles could be injected intravenously and, in theory,
      would be able to clear HIV from the blood stream.<br>
      <br>
      “The basic particle that we are using in these experiments was
      developed many years ago as an artificial blood product,” Hood
      says. “It didn’t work very well for delivering oxygen, but it
      circulates safely in the body and gives us a nice platform that we
      can adapt to fight different kinds of infections.”<br>
      <br>
      Since melittin attacks double-layered membranes indiscriminately,
      this concept is not limited to HIV. Many viruses, including
      hepatitis B and C, rely on the same kind of protective envelope
      and would be vulnerable to melittin-loaded nanoparticles.<br>
      <br>
      While this particular paper does not address contraception, Hood
      says the gel easily could be adapted to target sperm as well as
      HIV. But in some cases people may only want the HIV protection.<br>
      <br>
      “We also are looking at this for couples where only one of the
      partners has HIV, and they want to have a baby,” Hood says. “These
      particles by themselves are actually very safe for sperm, for the
      same reason they are safe for vaginal cells.”<br>
      <br>
      While this work was done in cells in a laboratory environment,
      Hood and his colleagues say the nanoparticles are easy to
      manufacture in large enough quantities to supply them for future
      clinical trials.<br>

          <br>
        </big></div>
      Inventor: WICKLINE SAMUEL A / LANZA GREGORY [US]<br>
      <br>
      Nanoparticulate compositions which employ membrane-integrating
      peptides to effect contraception and/or protection against
      infection by sexually transmitted virus are described.<br>
      <br>
      <b>CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION<br>
        <br>
      </b>[0001] This application claims priority from U.S. provisional
      application 61/405,108 filed 20 Oct. 2010. The contents of this
      document are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
      <b><br>
        FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
        <br>
      </b>[0002] The invention is in the fields of protection against
      conception and against HIV infection. More particularly, the
      invention concerns vaginal preparations that specifically interact
      with sperm and/or HIV using nanoparticulate delivery systems.<br>
      <b><br>
        BACKGROUND ART<br>
        <br>
      </b>[0003] There is a well recognized need for protection against
      HIV transmitted through sexual intercourse as well as an option
      for contraception, particularly in societies where women have
      little control over reproduction and sexual interaction. The
      present invention provides women with means to practice
      contraception and to protect themselves against HIV infection
      using a vaginal preparation which can be administered using a
      simple applicator and does not require cooperation or permission
      from sexual partners.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] The basis for the compositions of the invention resides in
      perfluorocarbon-based nanoparticles (PFC-NP) that are targeted to
      sperm or to HIV and that carry a membrane-integrating peptide,
      i.e., a peptide which forms pores in or lyses cell membranes. U.S.
      Pat. No. 7,943,168 ('168 patent), incorporated herein by
      reference, describes such perfluorocarbon nanoparticles which are
      associated with membrane-integrating peptides. Briefly, the
      nanoparticles comprise perfluorocarbon cores coated with a
      lipid/surfactant layer as described, for example, in U.S. Pat.
      Nos. 7,255,875 and 7,186,399 (the “Lanza patents”), also
      incorporated herein by reference. The various membrane-integrating
      peptides that can be associated with the nanoparticles are also
      described in the above-cited '168 patent and include
      membrane-lytic peptides and cell-penetrating peptides as well as
      pore-forming peptides. In particular, melittin and its analogs are
      described.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] As further noted in the above-referenced '168 patent, the
      nanoparticulates bearing the membrane-integrating peptides may be
      targeted. Targeting agents can include antibodies, aptamers,
      peptidomimetics and the like. A description of such targeting
      agents and means for attachment thereof is also found in the
      above-referenced Lanza patents as well as U.S. Pat. Nos.
      7,255,875, 7,566,442 and 7,344,698, also incorporated herein by
      reference.<b><br>

        DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
        <br>
      </b> [0006] The invention is directed to compositions designed for
      application to the vaginal vault which compositions comprise
      nanoparticles targeted to sperm wherein said nanoparticles further
      contain membrane-integrating peptides or comprise nanoparticles
      targeted to sexually transmitted viruses, such as HIV, which
      nanoparticles further contain membrane-integrating peptides or
      wherein the composition comprises both. It is desirable, in
      preventing infection by sexually transmitted viruses for the
      nanosnares or nanoparticles to be targeted. However, untargeted
      nanosnares may also be used for this indication. The same
      nanoparticles may target both sperm and virus.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] In another aspect, the invention concerns methods to
      prevent conception and/or protect a subject against virus
      infection in a subject which method comprises administering to the
      vagina of the subject the compositions of the invention.<br>

        <br>
        MODES OF CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
        <br>
      </b>[0014] In general, “a” or “an” refer to one or more than one
      of the referent unless the opposite intention is clear from the
      context.<br>
      <br>
      [0015] The compositions of the invention contain thousands of
      trillions of nanoparticles per intervaginal dose wherein these
      nanoparticles comprise one or more membrane-integrating peptides.
      In some embodiments, these nanoparticles, sometimes called herein
      “nanosnares”, are targeted specifically to sperm or to sexually
      transmitted viruses, such as HIV. These nanoparticles are
      typically perfluorocarbon nanoparticles (PFC-NP) and carry a
      potent toxin in the form of a membrane-integrating peptide that
      results in the formation of pores in the sperm or virus when these
      are fused to the nanoparticles. In the case of virus, specific
      targeting is not necessary since the nanoparticles are
      substantially larger than the virus particles. Nevertheless,
      efficiency may be improved by providing a targeting ligand. In the
      case of sperm, however, targeting is needed for efficient fusion
      because the fusion event establishes the proximity necessary for
      formation of a hemi-fusion stalk (&lt;5 nm) in a process driven
      passively by the energy stored in the lipid membrane of the
      PFC-NP. Since cells and sperm are a great deal larger than the
      nanoparticles, non-targeted nanoparticles even comprising multiple
      copies of the membrane-integrating peptide may not be sufficient
      to affect the viability of the cells or motility of the sperm.
      Since only sperm, and not endothelial cells are targeted,
      nontargeted cells (but not virus) are spared and the nanoparticles
      in the composition are destructive only to the targeted sperm. As
      noted above, both targeted and non-targeted particles that
      comprise the membrane-integrating peptide are effective against
      virus infections that are sexually transmitted, such as herpes or
      papillomavirus, or HIV.<br>
      <br>
      [0016] To target sperm, the nanoparticles may be associated with a
      targeting agent for the αvβ3 integrin, which is a well known
      docking site on the sperm cap. The targeting agent for this
      integrin may be an antibody specific for the integrin or an
      immunospecific portion thereof, an aptamer, or may be a
      peptidomimetic, such as those described in U.S. Pat. No.
      7,566,442, incorporated herein by reference. Alternatively, other
      known sperm-associated receptors can be targeted. In addition to
      targeting the sperm per se, progesterone can be added to the
      composition since it is a chemoattractant for sperm that swim up a
      hormonal gradient sensed through their cap progesterone receptors.
      Progesterone mimics could also be included as the targeting agent
      on the nanoparticles.<br>
      <br>
      [0017] Targeting agents for sperm also include antibodies or
      fragments thereof that are specifically immunoreactive with
      ligands on the surface of the sperm. (“Antibodies”, of course,
      include any immunoreactive portion of conventional antibodies,
      including recombinantly produced single chain antibodies, chimeric
      antibodies, polyclonal antibodies or monoclonal antibodies,
      antibody mimics, such as aptamers or peptidomimetics and the
      like.) A particularly useful antibody which might be used, or a
      fragment of which might be used, is the SPAM antibody marketed by
      Sigma-Aldrich that is specific for sperm.<br>
      <br>
      [0018] For capture of HIV, the targeting ligands may be those that
      bind to gp41 and/or gp120 epitopes. Here, too, antibodies or
      aptamers could be employed. Alternatively or in addition CD4, CCR5
      and CXCR4 peptides that imitate the viral membrane fusion process
      for T cells may be used. However, as noted above, effective
      defense against viral particles in general, including HIV, herpes
      and papillomavirus may be effected in the vaginal vault using
      nanosnares containing membrane-penetrating peptides that do not
      comprise targeting agents.<br>
      <br>
      [0019] The composition may include nanoparticles targeted to sperm
      or nanoparticles targeted to virus or both types of nanoparticles.
      It is also possible to include targeting ligands to both virus and
      sperm on the same nanoparticle, or to employ non-targeted
      nanoparticles for virus protection.<br>
      <br>
      [0020] For the targeted nanoparticles useful in the invention, the
      number of molecules of targeting ligand per nanosnare will vary
      depending on its nature. However, typically, the number of
      targeting ligands per nanoparticle is between 10 and 500,
      alternatively between 20 and 100 or between 20 and 30.<br>
      <br>
      [0021] The targeted nanoparticles further comprise toxic
      membrane-integrating peptides, which are exemplified by melittin.
      Melittin forms pores in lipid membranes that are too large to be
      repaired by standard membrane repair mechanisms and thus result in
      discharge of DNA from sperm or RNA from HIV, rendering both
      ineffective. This effect is confined in the vaginal vault to the
      targeted sperm and/or to virus particles for the reasons set forth
      above, i.e., fusion to the target is needed to effect pore
      formation in the case of cells as opposed to viruses. In addition,
      the nanoparticles are too large (100-500 nm, typically 250 nm) to
      penetrate the vaginal mucosa and thus their action is confined to
      the vaginal vault and they remain in place until washed away.<br>
      <br>
      [0022] As used herein, the word “peptide” is not intended to
      impose an upper limit on the number of amino acids contained. Any
      peptide/protein which is capable of effecting cell penetration can
      be used in the methods of the invention. The nature of the
      lipid/surfactant layer can be adjusted to provide a suitable
      environment for the peptides/proteins used in the invention
      depending on the specific characteristics thereof. Thus, the
      nature of the lipids and surfactants used in this layer are
      selected so as to accommodate cationic peptides, anionic peptides,
      neutral peptides, hydrophobic peptides, hydrophilic peptides,
      amphipathic peptides, etc.<br>
      <br>
      [0023] Membrane-integrating peptides useful in the invention
      include lytic peptides such as melittin and the classic pore
      forming peptides magainin and alamethicin (Ludtke, S. J., et al.,
      Biochemistry (1996) 35:13723-13728; He, K., et al., Biophys. J.
      (1996) 70:2659-2666). Pore forming peptides can also be derived
      from membrane active proteins, e.g., granulysin, prion proteins
      (Ramamoorthy, A., et al., Biochim Biophys Acta (2006)
      1758:154-163; Andersson, A., et al., Eur. Biophys. J. (2007) DOI
      10.1007/s00249-007-0131-9). Other peptides useful in the invention
      include naturally occurring membrane active peptides such as the
      defensins (Hughes, A. L., Cell Mol Life Sci (1999) 56:94-103), and
      synthetic membrane lytic peptides (Gokel, G W., et al., Bioorganic
      &amp; Medicinal Chemistry (2004) 12:1291-1304). Included as
      generally synthetic peptides are the D-amino acid analogs of the
      conventional L forms, especially peptides that have all of the
      L-amino acids replaced by the D-enantiomers. Peptidomimetics that
      display cell penetrating properties may be used as well. Thus
      “cell penetrating peptides” include both natural and synthetic
      peptides and peptidomimetics.<br>
      <br>
      [0024] One particular class of membrane-integrating peptides
      useful in the invention has the general characteristics of
      melittin in that it comprises a hydrophobic region of 10-20 amino
      acids adjacent to a cationic region of 3-6 amino acids. Melittin
      itself is formed from a longer precursor in bee venom and has the
      amino acid sequence<br>

      [0025] Various analogs of melittin can be identified and tested as
      described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,645,996, for example. Other designs
      for peptides useful in the invention will be familiar to those in
      the art. In the melittin analogs, the hydrophobic region is
      preferably 15-20 amino acids long, more preferably 19-21 and the
      cationic sequence is preferably 3-5 or 4 amino acids long.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] The toxicity of such peptides is affected by a number of
      factors, including the charge status, bending modulus,
      compressibility, and other biophysical properties of the membranes
      as well as environmental factors such as temperature and pH. The
      presence or absence of certain moieties (other than the targeted
      epitope) on the cell surface may also effect toxicity.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] Illustrated below is the membrane-integrating peptide
      melittin, which is a water-soluble, cationic, amphipathic 26 amino
      acid alpha-helical peptide. Suchanek, G., et al., PNAS (1978)
      75:701-704. It constitutes 40% of the dry weight of the venom of
      the honey bee Apis mellifera. Although a candidate for cancer
      chemotherapy in the past, melittin has proved impractical because
      of its non-specific cellular lytic activity and the rapid
      degradation of the peptide in blood. Attempts have been made to
      stabilize melittin by using D-amino acid constituents (Papo, N.,
      et al., Cancer Res. (2006) 66:5371-5378) and melittin has been
      demonstrated to enhance nuclear access of non-viral gene delivery
      vectors (Ogris, M., et al., J. Biol. Chem. (2001) 276:47550-47555
      and Boeckle, S., et al., J. Control Release (2006) 112:240-248).
      The ultimate effect of melittin is to cause the formation of pores
      in a cell membrane, and membranes of internal cell organelles, so
      as to damage the cell and lead to cell death. As noted in the
      examples below, these proteins are also toxic to viruses.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] In another embodiment a peptide from the Bcl-2-family
      proteins is employed based on activating or inhibitory activity,
      for example, BH3 domain peptides (Danial, N. N., et al., Cell
      (2004) 116:205-219). After penetrating to the cellular interior
      the peptides cause activation or inhibition of the endogenous
      Bcl-2-family or associated proteins in the cells (Walensky, L. D.,
      et al., Mol Cell (2006) 24:199-210). Thus, the cellular machinery
      of apoptosis can be regulated to a variety of therapeutic goals.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] In PFC-NP, the core is inert and nontoxic but facilitates
      fusion by mobilizing component lipids and relaxing lipid membrane
      structures.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] A variety of means can be employed to couple the targeting
      agent and the membrane-integrating peptide to the nanoparticles
      but one advantageous method is through fusion with a peptide
      linker which is a truncated form of melittin that retains its
      membrane-binding potential but deletes its lytic capacity. This
      linking peptide is described in an article by Pan, H., et al.,
      FASEB J. (2010) published online 24 Mar. 2010. This peptide and
      effective analogs are also described in WO2009/151788,
      incorporated herein by reference for the description of these
      peptides and methods for employing these peptides as linkers to
      couple any desired moiety to the PFC-NP. This linker can be
      inserted into the lipid layer of the PFC-NP using a 10-minute
      mixing procedure that drives the peptide to form a hydrophobic
      interaction with the lipid layer. Alternatively, a component of
      the lipid/surfactant layer may be used.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] However, melittin may simply be passively loaded onto the
      PFC-NP. The hydrophobic portions of melittin are sufficiently
      compatible with the lipid/surfactant layer to effect coupling.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] Targeted PFC-NP are prepared as described in the
      above-referenced patents. Targeting ligands to virus or other
      sperm cell marker that are peptides may be fused to the linker
      peptide described above to obtain up to 2,000-30,000 total copies
      of each associated with each nanoparticle. Thus, each of the
      nanoparticles may also contain about 10-1,000 targeting ligands.
      Gentle centrifugation removes any unbound ligands. Targeting
      ligands may be attached to a phospholipid anchor. This is coupled
      to a component of the lipid/surfactant layer and formulated into
      the particle itself.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] Similarly, a multiplicity of toxin molecules may be
      associated with the nanoparticles. In the case of melittin, the
      hydrophobic α-helical portion of the protein serves as a linker
      whereby the lytic portion is associated with the nanoparticle.
      Alternative lytic or pore-forming membrane-integrating peptides
      may be fused to this linker and associated with the nanoparticles
      as well. The level of toxic pore-forming molecules associated with
      the nanoparticles can also be varied from just a few to more than
      20,000. The pore-forming peptide or lytic peptide may be coupled
      to a component of the lipid/surfactant layer, as well, in order to
      associate the toxin with the nanoparticles.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] The preparation of successfully derivatized nanoparticles
      can be verified by means known in the art. For example, flow
      cytometry may be used to identify and count nanoparticles
      successfully as associated with targeting ligands and toxins.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] Efficacy as a contraceptive may be evaluated in vitro by
      demonstrating disrupted motility of sperm at selected
      concentrations of targeted nanoparticles by computer assisted
      semen analysis and viability of sperm may be tested by dye
      exclusion and apoptosis staining. Efficacy against virus, such as
      HIV, may be evaluated by calculating the viral load remaining in
      the supernatant of a mixture of virus and nanoparticles following
      5-30 minute incubations with continuous mixing at 37° C. and
      low-speed centrifugation to pellet nanoparticle-virus complexes
      with visual confirmation of complexes by TEM. In addition,
      targeted nanoparticles incubated in viral cultures are assessed
      for efficacy of antiviral activity by incubating these cultures
      with cells that are candidates for viral infection, and observing
      infection rates.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] The nanoparticles described above are formulated into
      suitable preparations for vaginal administration.<br>
      <b><br>
        [0037] Vaginal Formulations<br>
        <br>
      </b>[0038] The nanosnares of the invention are specifically
      formulated in a composition suitable for vaginal administration.
      These formulations differ markedly from pharmaceutical
      compositions in general. Specifically, they are designed to
      provide a suitable residence time in the vagina and are adjusted
      for pH and release characteristics that are suitable for this
      environment. The formulations, when marketed, would be labeled
      appropriately to limit their use to vaginal administration.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] Suitable vaginal preparations may be in the form of
      aerosols, foams, gels, creams, suppositories or tablets; typically
      these are in the forms of foams or gels or dissolvable waffles.
      The excipients in such compositions are typically polyethylene
      glycols, emulsifying agents, lanolin, starch, algins,
      polysorbates, xanthan gums, glycerol and the like. Preparation of
      vaginal compositions is well known in the art and is described,
      for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,725,870 and 6,706,276
      incorporated herein by reference. Deodorants, colorants and other
      cosmetic materials may be added as well.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] In addition to direct application to the vaginal vault, the
      vaginal formulations containing the nanosnares of the invention
      may be applied to condoms. Formulations designed to be retained at
      the surface of the condom until use are within the skill of the
      art. Typically, gels or creams can be used for this purpose. This
      embodiment is especially useful for nanosnares targeted to sperm,
      an analogy to contraceptive creams that are often applied to
      condom surfaces. However, the nanospheres designed to inhibit
      infectivity of sexually transmitted virus may be included as well.
      The surface may be either the inner or outer surface of the condom
      or both.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] The formulations may contain a single type of
      nanosnare—i.e., nanosnares that comprise at least one
      membrane-integrating peptide and which either further comprise a
      targeting ligand for a sexually transmitted virus, or further
      comprise a targeting ligand for sperm or do not comprise a
      targeting ligand or that further comprise both a targeting ligand
      for sexually transmitted virus and a targeting ligand for sperm or
      combinations of the foregoing.<br>
      <b><br>
        [0042] Usage<br>
        <br>
      </b>[0043] For use, the vaginal preparations of the invention are
      used in effective amounts. As prepared as a suppository or tablet,
      typically the suppository or tablet is in the range of 0.1-10
      grams or 1-5 grams; as a cream or gel, similar quantities may be
      employed. The mode of application is dependent on the nature of
      the composition; for liquid or gel compositions, an applicator is
      generally employed. Use of coated condoms is also contemplated.
      The application should be carried out prior to the beginning of
      vaginal intercourse, generally 1 to 30 minutes, up to 12 hours
      prior to intercourse. Intermediate times such as 2 hours, 6 hours,
      etc., are also acceptable. The nature of carriers and excipients
      and their mode of application is understood in the art.<br>

      of egg lecithin (98 mol %) and
      dipalmitoyl-phosphatidylethanolamine (DPPE) 2 mol % (Avanti Polar
      Lipids, Piscataway, N.J.) was dissolved in chloroform, evaporated
      under reduced pressure, dried in a 50° C. vacuum oven and
      dispersed into water by sonication. The suspension was combined
      with either perfluoro-octylbromide (PFOB), or perfluoro-15-crown
      ether (CE) (Gateway Specialty Chemicals, St. Peters, Mo.), and
      distilled deionized water and continuously processed at 20,000
      lbf/in&lt;2 &gt;for 4 min with an S110 Microfluidics emulsifier

        <br>
      </b>[0055] Perfluorocarbon nanoparticles were incubated in a 900
      μM solution of melittin at 4° C. protected from light for 3 days.
      The nanoparticles were then centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 5 minutes
      and washed with PBS three times. Nanoparticles were stored under
      argon at 4° C. until use. For comparison, blank nanoparticles of
      the same concentration were obtained by incubating with PBS rather
      than melittin according to this protocol.<br>
      <br>
      [0056] In more detail, 100 μL of 10 mM melittin or 100 μL of PBS
      was added to 1000 μL of blank nanoparticles and incubated at 4° C.
      protected from light with gentle shaking for 3 days.<br>
      <br>
      [0057] The level of suspension in the vial used in the mixture is
      marked and then centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 5 minutes and washed
      4× with PBS. The nanoparticles are resuspended to original volume
      in PBS and stored under argon at 4° C. until use.<br>
      <br>
      [0058] In the alternative, melittin was dissolved in 100 mM KCl
      (pH 7, 10 mM HEPES) at 0.1 mM and 2-20 mL was added to 50 μl of
      nanoparticle suspension with mixing. After incubation at room
      temperature for 10 min, the nanoparticles were washed twice by
      centrifugation (100 g, 10 min) to remove the unbound melittin. The
      melittin in the supernatant was quantified by measuring the
      tryptophan fluorescence (described below). Depending on the amount
      of melittin added, the melittin-loaded nanoparticles yielded molar
      lipid/melittin ratios ranging from 1,000 to 40.<br>
      <br>
      [0059] In still another alternative, the PFC-NP prepared in
      Preparation A, paragraph B or similar targeted nanosnares were
      incubated at a concentration of 0.91 mM melittin in water with
      rotation at 4° C. for 72 hours to load melittin. Nanosnares were
      isolated by low speed centrifugation for 20 min. at 1000 g to
      “softly” pellet the nanosnares. Nanosnare supernatants were
      analyzed for unbound melittin using an Eclipse™ plate reader at
      excitation 280 nm and emission 300-500 nm Single maximum emission
      peak sizes corresponding to the amount of melittin present were
      then compared to a standard 0.91 mM melittin emission peak and
      used to calculate supernatant and corresponding nanoparticle
      pellet concentrations of melittin for the nanosnares.<br>

        Vaginal Epithelium Toxicity<br>
        <br>
      </b>[0060] In order to function satisfactorily, the compositions
      of the invention must not be toxic to the vaginal epithelium. This
      example demonstrates that although free melittin not coupled to
      nanoparticles is toxic, melittin coupled to untargeted
      nanoparticles is not toxic at concentrations useful in the
      invention.<br>
      <br>
      [0061] Immortalized vaginal epithelial cells (VK2/E6E7) were
      obtained from ATCC (CRL-2616) and propagated by the suggested
      protocol. For toxicity studies, 7500 cells were added to each well
      of a 96-well plate and allowed to attach for 24 hours. Melittin or
      melittin coated PFC-NP were then added and incubated with the
      cells for 12 hours at 37° C. with shaking at 500 rpm. Cells were
      washed once with media and incubated with MTT reagent for 4 hours.
      The colored product was solubilized in DMSO and absorbance at 570
      nm was measured using a plate reader.<br>
      <br>
      [0062] In more detail, cells were detached from a T75 flask by
      rinsing with 2-3 mL of trypsin, followed by adding 5 mL trypsin
      and incubating at 37° C. for 15 minutes. Five mL DMEM-FBS is then
      added to stop the trypsin, and the mixture is centrifuged at 900
      rpm for 5 minutes, supernatant is removed and the cells are
      resuspended in 5 mL of Keratinocyte-Serum Free Media
      (Invitrogen™). The cells are diluted to approximately 75,000
      cells/mL, and 100 μL of the cell suspension is added to each well
      of a 96-well plate and incubated for 24 hours at 37° C. The media
      are replaced with 100 μL of media containing the melittin or
      melittin-loaded nanoparticles at various concentrations and
      incubated for 12 hours at 37° C. with shaking at 500 rpm. The test
      solutions are then removed and the cells washed once with media.<br>
      <br>
      [0063] To each well containing 100 μL of media, 20 μL of MTT
      reagent (5 mg/mL MTT in PBS) were added, and incubated for 4 hours
      at 37° C. The media are removed and 75 μL of DMSO is added to each
      well and incubated for 10 minutes at 37° C. with shaking at 500
      rpm. Absorbance is read at 570 nm using a plate reader.<br>
      <br>
      [0064] Results are shown in FIGS. 1A-1C. As shown in FIG. 1A,
      concentrations of melittin as low as 1 μM dramatically decrease
      the viability of vaginal epithelium cells. However, as shown in
      FIG. 1B, concentrations of melittin up to 20 μM do not decrease
      epithelial cell viability. In fact, as shown in FIG. 1C,
      nanoparticles containing melittin at concentrations up to 20 μM
      appear to have a somewhat positive effect on cell viability.
      Controls with nanoparticles not containing melittin (blank NP),
      but comparable in concentration to the melittin-containing

        Fusogenic Anti-HIV “Nanosnares” Decrease Infectivity of HIV to
        TZM-b1 Cells<br>
        <br>
      </b>[0067] Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) pseudotyped HIV-1 is a
      strain of HIV that demonstrates several fold increases in the
      levels of transfection over amphotropic HIV by utilizing an
      endocytic entry mechanism. TZM-b1 cells are specially engineered
      HeLa cells designed to express CD4 and either CXCR4 or CCR5 which
      are required for HIV fusion. The cells also contain HIV-TAT
      inducible luciferase. When TZM-b1 cells are infected, firefly
      luciferase is produced. Cells to be assessed for infection are
      lysed and luciferin is added. Fluorescence is produced by infected
      cells, and the level of fluorescence, in relative fluorescence
      units, corresponds to the level of viral infection.<br>
      <br>
      [0068] In this assay, PFC-NP (25 μl) providing 1 μM melittin in a
      nanoparticle/virus solution and virus (HIV or VSV pseudotyped HIV)
      (50 μl) were mixed, and then added to 4×10&lt;4 &gt;cultured cells
      in 50 well plates and incubated overnight at 37° C. The level of
      infection was measured as described above.<br>
      <br>
      [0069] The results are shown in FIG. 2. As shown, when HIV alone
      or VSV pseudotyped HIV alone was added to the cells, high levels
      of infection occurred. However, the level of viral infectivity of
      either virus combined with the melittin-containing nanoparticles
      of the invention is dramatically mitigated.<br>
      <br>
      [0070] The procedure set forth above was repeated comparing
      HIV-1p120 which is a CXCR4-dependent strain and p134 which is a
      CCR5 dependent strain. These results are shown in FIG. 3A and FIG.
      3B. As shown, the infectivity of either p120 or p134 in the
      presence of nanoparticles alone (blank nanoparticles) is not
      effectively reduced; however, in the presence of
      melittin-containing nanoparticles with an effective concentration
      of 10 μM melittin, infectivity is dramatically decreased.<br>

      [0072] A lipid film containing 92.8 mol % lecithin (phosphatidyl

      2-iminothiolane in 0.1 M PBS, 10 mmol EDTA buffer pH 8.0, flushed
      with argon gas and incubated at RT for 1 hour. For conjugation of
      CD4 to the nanoparticles, 15 ml of 2 mol % MPB-PEG-DSPE PFOB was
      added into 2.1 ml of modified CD4 solution and incubated at room
      temperature for 2 hours. Then 7 mg cysteine was added to quench
      MPB reactivity and incubated for another 2 hours. Finally, the
      nanoparticle suspension was then dialyzed in 2 L PBS buffer three
      times at intervals of 2, 3, and 2 hours to remove free unreacted
      sCD4 and excess 2-iminothiolane thus producing CD4 nanosnares.<br>
      <br>
      [0074] To produce melittin loaded CD4 nanosnares, CD4 nanosnares
      were incubated at a concentration of 0.91 mM melittin in water
      with rotation at 4° C. for 72 hours to load melittin. Nanosnares
      were isolated by low speed centrifugation for 20 min. at 1000 g to
      “softly” pellet the nanosnares. Nanosnare supernatants were
      analyzed for unbound melittin using an Eclipse™ plate reader at
      excitation 280 nm and emission 300-500 nm. Single maximum emission
      peak sizes corresponding to the amount of melittin present were
      then compared to a standard 0.91 mM melittin emission peak and
      used to calculate supernatant and corresponding nanoparticle
      pellet concentrations of melittin for the nanosnares. Melittin
      only nanosnares were created using the same method in the absence
      of sCD4. “Blank” nanosnares were created using the same method
      without sCD4 or melittin.<br>
      <br>
      [0075] In the resulting products PFC-NP comprising melittin
      contained about 20,000 melittin molecules per nanosnare and PFC-NP
      coupled to CD4 contained about 20-30 CD4 molecules per nanosnare.<br>
      <br>
      [0076] HIV-1 producing 293T cell supernatants were harvested 48 h
      postlipofection, filtered, and assayed for p24 antigen content by
      enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Viruses were resuspended in
      culture media, aliquoted and stored at −80° C. Equal amounts of
      virus based on p24 content were used in each experiment.<br>
      <br>
      [0077] HIV-1p134 viral strain was coincubated with blank
      nanospheres, melittin-bearing nanospheres, CD4-labeled nanospheres
      or CD4-melittin containing nanospheres at the same concentration
      levels of nanoparticles in each case. Ninety (90) μL of virus were
      added to 10 μL of the various nanoparticulate stocks. The final
      concentration with regard to nanosnares containing melittin is
      0.06 mM melittin. To test whether the virus particles can be
      captured by the nanospheres, advantage is taken of the
      comparatively large size of the nanoparticles as compared to virus
      such that the nanoparticles are segregated by centrifugation at
      1000×G. To detect capture of the virus, the level of the viral
      protein p24 in the supernatant and precipitate was compared. The
      initial p24 value was the same for every sample, confirming that
      the same level of virus particles was present in each sample.<br>
      <br>
      [0078] As shown in FIG. 4, CD4-containing nanospheres show a
      larger percentage of p24 in the precipitate as compared to
      supernatant in contrast to nanospheres that do not contain CD4.<br>

        Effect of Melittin-Containing Particles on Sperm Motility and
        Viability<br>
        <br>
      </b>[0079] Human semen samples were obtained from the Washington
      University in vitro fertilization laboratory and stored at 37° C.
      until use. Semen was diluted in EmbryoMax® Human Tubal Fluid (HTF)
      (Millipore) and free melittin or melittin-coupled nanoparticles in
      HTF was added to achieve a final sperm concentration of 10 million
      sperm per mL. (For nanoparticles, samples were pipetted up and
      down 3 times every 10 minutes to keep the nanoparticles
      suspended.) Samples were incubated in 96-well plates for 30
      minutes at 37° C. with shaking at 150 rpm to prevent sperm from
      settling. Afterwards, Viadent® stain (Hoechst 33258, Hamilton
      Thorne) was added to achieve a final stain concentration of 10
      μg/mL and samples were incubated for an additional 5 minutes.
      Sperm motility and viability were determined using an IVOS®
      Computer Assisted Sperm Analyzer (Hamilton Thorne).<br>
      <br>
      [0080] The results are shown in FIGS. 5A-5D. As shown, both sperm
      viability and sperm motility are impeded in free melittin, but the
      presence of melittin on nanoparticles in comparable amounts shows
      no effect. The ability of nanoparticles to protect sperm (and
      endothelial cells) but not viruses from melittin poisoning is
      explained by the difference in size of the virus as compared to
      sperm or epithelial cells. These results indicate that sperm
      targeting is needed to effect inhibition of motility and viability
      of sperm. Means to provide sperm-targeting are illustrated in the
      next example.<br>

      </b>Inventor: CHUNG BONG YOUL, et al.<br>
      <br>
      [0001] The present invention relates to a method of separating
      melittin from bee venom, and more particularly to a method and a
      pure bee venom melittin from separation by using a cation-exchange
      resin yield.<br>
      <br>
      [0002] The venom has been recognized medical treatment effect from
      the example. 4th century BC Hippocrates is called the bee venom as
      a "strange and even mysterious about", was intended for use in the
      treatment of inflammation such as arthritis. Also, our country was
      treating the disease as bongryo from Koguryo of progenitor
      Dongmyeong of Goguryeo time, when the Shilla sinmunwang time and
      Huh authored the Donguibogam ryeoteumyeo dozen diseases with
      needle in court, Emperor Gojong when using bee venom seen as a
      treatment of civilians needle It was our deep-rooted folk
      medicine.<br>
      <br>
      [0003] Recent studies, bee venom has anticancer effects,
      rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis or arthritis pain in
      degenerative diseases such as relaxation, lower blood pressure in
      the blood lymph cells and the regeneration and growth of red blood
      cells, stimulate the adrenal adrenaline secretion, the local area
      It is known that the injection operation and an improvement in the
      bactericidal activity of blood reflux.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] It should be noted is that bee venom treatment is 10 000
      allergy sufferers because it does cause hives or difficulty
      breathing as one out of every people must have the prior allergic
      reaction test. There are also symptoms of itchy swollen after bee
      venom therapy, also it algi the body aches badly.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] is a major component of bee venom, which is over 40
      peptides, carbohydrates, enzymes, reported that consists of amino
      acids, of which 40-50% is melittin, a phospholipase A2, accounting
      for 10-12%.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] melittin is hemolytic action, as well as antibacterial and
      antifungal action and this, in recent years anti-cancer activity,
      anti-inflammatory, anti-pain action, a number of effects as the
      compositions of antiviral agents has been reported. On the other
      hand, it phospholipase A2 (phospholipase A2: PLA2) is the blood
      pressure reduction, blood flow improving effect it is hemolytic
      action, to liberate the phospholipids of cell membranes makes
      cells stronger. In particular, the anti-inflammatory effects of
      bee venom is melittin, APA Min, mast cell granules reduced peptide
      (MCD peptide), ahdol Lapin, it is known that protease inhibitors
      such acts.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] However, phospholipase A2, causes inflammation, which is
      known as the most powerful allergen of bee venom components. In
      addition, 0.5 ~ 1% of the histamine (histamin) may cause
      irritation and itching. APA is a civil and mast cell granules are
      reduced peptide neurotoxins block the potassium channels in
      neurons.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] Accordingly, to remove the toxic component from the bee
      venom, and to develop a method that can separate only melittin has
      been urgently required.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] In the Republic of Korea Patent No. 10-0744755 call, the
      bee venom into the buffer solution and then centrifuged to remove
      the surface lipids, the supernatant of pH 3.0 ~ pH 4.0 acetate
      buffer as the first gel filtration chromatography to Meli Separate
      the tin, and the separated melittin with hydrochloric acid
      solution the second gel filtration chromatography to obtain the
      desalted and then neutralized with NaOH, so that the cause of the
      enzyme phospholipase A2 in allergic generation-free method to
      remove the melittin It is disclosed.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] However, the method has a low yield of pure melittin
      melittin and phospholipase this resolution of the lipase A2 is not
      good, go through desalination and the neutralization step because
      the process is complex, and the purification time is long, the
      purification efficiency is low Issues have.<br>

      [0011] Republic of Korea Patent Registration No. 10-0744755<br>
      <br>
      [0012] The present invention has been made to solve the above
      problems, one object of the present invention to provide a method
      of separation in high yield from the pure bee venom melittin.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] Another object of the invention is to provide a process for
      easily producing a high efficiency from the bee venom melittin to
      pure.<br>
      <br>
      [0014] In one embodiment of the present invention relates to a
      method of separating from the bee venom melittin, separation
      method of the present invention<br>
      <br>
      [0015] (i) of bee venom is dissolved in distilled water or a
      buffer solution and then centrifuged to remove the precipitate and
      to obtain a bee venom solution jijilcheung and purified by taking
      the middle aqueous layer.<br>
      <br>
      [0016] (ii) solidifying the equilibrium phase with the distilled
      water or a buffer solution and injected into a cation exchange
      resin column purified bee venom solution;<br>
      <br>
      [0017] (III) to the distilled water or a buffer solution, a salt
      solution containing from 0.2 to 5 M in a step of 100% to the slope
      (gradient) eluted in 0.<br>
      <br>
      [0018] In one embodiment of the invention, the venom is a shock
      hazard in that it contains doknang bee, physical methods, chemical
      methods such as extraction by obtained by commercially available.<br>
      <br>
      [0019] There is bee venom is added to the distilled water or a
      buffer solution in step (i) have to be limited to that amount,
      considering the convenience of working with distilled water or
      buffer solution, 100 parts by weight of 0.5 to 10 parts by weight
      is added to the It is preferred.<br>
      <br>
      [0020] In one embodiment of the present invention, distilled water
      or a buffer solution may be a neutral or alkaline, melittin and pH
      7 to 12 in the resolution aspect of phospholipase A preferably, pH
      10 to 11.5 is more preferred .<br>
      <br>
      [0021] The buffer solutions include phosphate buffer solution,
      Tris buffer solution, potassium chloride buffer solution and the
      like can be used, but is not limited thereto.<br>
      <br>
      [0022] The distilled water is added to adjust the pH, such as
      sodium hydroxide.<br>
      <br>
      [0023] The distilled water or a buffer solution, it is preferable
      to use the same solution in step (i) to (iii).<br>
      <br>
      [0024] The purified bee venom solution obtained in step (i) can
      remove impurities that are insoluble passed through a 0.2 to 0.45
      um filter.<br>
      <br>
      [0025] In addition, the purified bee venom solution can be used in
      dialysis for one night at 2 to 25 ° C using a dialysis membrane.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] As the step (ii) a polymer cation exchange resin is
      introduced the functional group with a cation exchange capacity in
      the, polymer matrix, for example, polystyrene (polystyrene),
      polyphenolic (polyphenolic) resin, cellulose (cellulose ),
      polyacrylamide (polyacrylamide), the test is, sepharose
      (Sepharose), and the like can be used however, and the like. As
      the functional group with a cation exchange capacity, for example,
      RCH2SO3 &lt;-&gt; H &lt;+&gt;, C6H5SO3 &lt;-&gt; H &lt;+&gt;,
      C6H5PO3 &lt;2 -&gt; (Na &lt;+&gt;) 2, RCOO &lt;-&gt; Na &lt;+&gt;,
      C6H5CH2N (CH2COO &lt;-&gt; H &lt;+&gt;) 2, carboxymethylcellulose
      (Carboxymethyl), phosphate (phosphate), sulfoethyl (sulfoethyl),
      sulfopropyl (sulfopropyl), diethyl (2-hydroxypropyl quaternary
      amino) (diethyl (2-hydroxylpropyl quaternary amino)), and the like
      can be used however, and the like. Preferably phosphate-Sepharose
      or Sepharose carboxymethylcellulose may be used.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] was observed melittin is shown to bind to the cation
      exchange resin at pH 12 or less, the higher the pH of binding was
      weaker. This is because the isoelectric point (pI) of melittin is
      pH 12.2.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] On the other hand, phospholipase A2 was passed through the
      column without binding as the cation exchange resin is at pH 10 to
      12. Therefore, according to the present invention can be
      completely separated from the phospholipase A2 from melittin.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] step (iii) in step (ii) with distilled water or 0.2 to 5
      100% gradient of solution at 0 was added a salt of M for buffer in
      the (gradient) elution ionic strength in accordance with the salt
      concentration (conductivity ) it can be separated and combined
      components to the cation exchange resin by. The higher the bonding
      strength, while increasing the salt concentration of the
      components can be separated.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] The salts that can be used without restriction as the ionic
      strength is adjustable, sodium chloride (NaCl) is preferred.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] The eluted fractions containing the melittin in the above
      step (iii) can be confirmed through electrophoresis, HPLC of the
      standard sample.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] Thus, the collection of fractions containing only the
      melittin and melittin can be obtained a highly pure lyophilized.
      The resulting melittin is phospholipase A2 is toxic ingredients
      such as antimicrobial agents removed completely without side
      effects occur, such as allergic, anti-inflammatory drugs,
      anti-cancer drugs, anti-viral agents can be used effectively,
      cosmetics, quasi-drugs, and more.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] According to the present invention, a highly purified
      melittin does not contain other components in addition to from bee
      venom melittin it can be isolated in a high yield. Separation
      method of the present invention can be simply prepared at a high
      efficiency from the bee venom melittin to pure using a cation
      exchange resin column.<br>

      <br>
      [0033] As purified bee venom production method according to one
      embodiment of the invention shown in FIG. 1, it is possible to
      prepare the purified bee venom powder (S 11). In this case, be
      prepared with purified bee venom Bee venom powder can be collected
      from seoyangjong bees (Apis Mellifera).<br>
      <br>
      [0034] Here, there purified bee venom powder can be prepared by
      conventional various methods, specifically, the bee venom
      collected from bees by bee venom collection device to air-dry,
      acceptable tablet, purified bee venom powder through the process
      of sterilization and freeze-dried It can be prepared, the thus
      prepared powder was purified bee venom and bee venom may be
      similar to the physiological activity is collected from bees, but
      the present invention is not limited thereto.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] Next, the mixed powder and distilled water to purified bee
      venom and bee venom solution is prepared (S12). At this time, the
      distilled mixture is preferably purified bee venom 1000㎖ to 1500㎖
      per 1 g of powder.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] Here, when the amount is less than 1000-ml of distilled
      water are mixed, the viscosity of the bee venom solution is
      increased, and thus the permeability of the bee venom solution to
      the ultrafiltration membrane will be described later filtration
      (ultrafiltration membrane) is lowered, to lower the yield after
      filtration There we have a problem. Further, if the amount exceeds
      1500 ml of distilled water are mixed, amount of time required for
      the filtration and drying of the bee venom solution is
      uneconomical because the longer a problem.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] In addition, the yield of purified bee venom in the case of
      distilled water to adjust the mixed powder 1000㎖ to purified bee
      venom 1500㎖ per 1g may be greater than or equal to 60%.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] The bee venom solution and the cut-off (cut-off) was
      filtered with the size 10kDa (kilo-Dalton) the ultrafiltration
      membrane (ultrafiltration membrane) to remove the allergenic
      components contained in bee venom solution (S 13).<br>
      <br>
      [0039] an approximate molecular weight of the tablet is the same
      as the major component of bee venom powder following Table 2.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] [Table 2]<br>
      <br>
      [0042] As shown in Table 2, which is known as a strong allergic
      component Phospholipase A2 (Phospholipase A2) and is in the
      molecular weight of the hyaluronidase (Hyaluronidase) is
      approximately 13kDa and 38kDa, respectively. The ribosome, the
      mitochondria, the case of a biomolecule, such as viruses, in
      general, to the molecular weight Dalton (Dalton) indicates the
      approximate molecular weight, and estimate the size (size) in the
      molecular weight.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] Thus, purified bee venom production method according to one
      embodiment of the present invention, by setting the
      ultrafiltration membrane cut-off size of the 10kDa, in such a way
      as to not pass through the material having a higher size, allergic
      component of force included in the bee venom solution You can
      remove the fabric first with lipase A2 and hyaluronidase. In
      addition, filtration, by applying pressure to the bee venom
      solution was filtered quickly proceed, it is possible to reduce
      the filtration time.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] to obtain the back, purified bee venom allergy component
      removed (S14). At this time, the resulting purified bee venom is
      pain Min (apamin) at least 4% by weight, melittin (melittin) and

      purified bee venom according to another embodiment of the present
      invention.<br>
      <br>
      [0046] purified bee venom production process according to another
      embodiment of the present invention 2, the first preparation of
      purified bee venom powder (S21). At this time, purified bee venom
      powder can be prepared in the same manner as the purified bee
      venom powder according to the exemplary embodiment of the present
      invention.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] Next, the mixed powder and distilled water to purified bee
      venom and bee venom solution is prepared (S22). Here, the
      distilled mixture is preferably purified bee venom 100㎖ to 200㎖

      30kDa ultrafiltration membrane for removal of the allergenic
      component included in the bee venom solution (S23).<br>
      <br>
      [0049] In particular, when the amount of less than 100 ml of
      distilled water are mixed, the viscosity of the solution increased
      and the bee venom thus ultrafiltration membrane permeability is
      lowered, there is a problem that can lower the yield after
      filtration. Further, if the amount of more than 200 mL of
      distilled water to be mixed, with reference to Table 2, the
      concentration of the allergenic component of the Phospholipase A2
      and dilution, ultrafiltration membrane for phosphorylation strong
      allergic component is increased because the transmission of the
      lipase A2 to the phospholipase A2 has a problem that can not be
      reduced as much as possible.<br>
      <br>
      [0050] Thus, purified bee venom production process according to
      another embodiment of the present invention in a distilled water,

      removed (S24). At this time, purified bee venom that is obtained
      may include pain Min (apamin) of 2.5% or more, melittin (melittin)
      at least 45% by weight, the phospholipase A2 is 1 wt% or less.<br>
      <br>
      [0052] As described above, according to purified bee venom
      production method according to one embodiment of the invention,
      the force leading to a strong allergic reactions included lipase
      A2 (Phospholipase A2) and hyaluronidase is ultrafiltration from
      the purified bee venom claim (Hyaluronidase) in by removing by,
      there is an advantage to essentially produce a safe separation and
      purification from the venom allergies.<br>

      Melittin is the principal active component of apitoxin (bee venom)
      and is a powerful stimulator of phospholipase A2. Melittin is a
      peptide consisting of 26 amino acids with the sequence
      GIGAVLKVLTTGLPALISWIKRKRQQ.<b><br>
        <br>
        Biological effects<br>
        <br>
      </b>Melittin inhibits protein kinase C, Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent
      protein kinase II, myosin light chain kinase and Na+/K+-ATPase
      (synaptosomal membrane) and is a cell membrane lytic factor.
      Melittin is a small peptide with no disulphide bridge; the
      N-terminal part of the molecule is predominantly hydrophobic and
      the C-terminal part is hydrophilic and strongly basic.<br>
      <br>
      Extensive work with melittin has shown that the venom has multiple
      effects, probably, as a result of its interaction with negatively
      charged phospholipids. It inhibits well known transport pumps such
      as the Na+-K+-ATPase and the H+-K+-ATPase. Melittin increases the
      permeability of cell membranes to ions, particularly Na+ and
      indirectly Ca2+, because of the Na+-Ca2+-exchange. This effect
      results in marked morphological and functional changes,
      particularly in excitable tissues such as cardiac myocytes. In
      some other tissues, e.g., cornea, not only Na+ but Cl−
      permeability is also increased by melittin. Similar effects to
      melittin on H+-K+-ATPase have been found with the synthetic
      amphipathic polypeptide Trp-3.[2]<br>
      <br>
      Melittin also exhibits potent anti-microbial activity. For
      example, melittin has been shown to exert "profound inhibitory
      effects" on Borrelia burgdorferi, the bacteria that causes lyme
      disease.[3] Melittin has also been shown to kill the yeast Candida
      albicans[4] and to suppress Mycoplasma hominis and Chlamydia
      trachomatis infections.[5][6][7]<br>
      <b><br>
        Potential therapeutic applications<br>
        <br>
      </b>At Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, very
      small nanobot "nanobee" devices are being developed to carefully
      deliver melittin, which is known to disrupt cellular walls and
      thus destroy cells, to tumor cells in animals.[8] In February
      2013, it was reported that nanoparticles carrying melittin were
      effective in destroying HIV by eroding the double-layer viral
      envelope surrounding the virus. Possible applications include a
      vaginal gel that would target HIV intrusion prior to infection and
      as an intravenous treatment of extant HIV infections.[9]<br>
      <br>
      It has been suggested that the regulation of S100B by melittin has
      potential for the treatment of epilepsy.[10]<b><br>
