          Abstract --</span> An improved engine (1) uses a dwelling
        scotch yoke (42) and a journalled flywheel (20) which provides
        for stalling the translatory movement of oppositely paired
        pistons (10) during the power stroke so as to achieve a clean
        exhaust and an energy efficient engine. The yoke (42) is made up
        from a U-shaped cam member (43) to which the piston rods (12)
        are connected at junction (114). The cam member (43) defines an
        involuted cam (44) which contacts the cam follower (32) carried
        by the flywheel (20).<br>

            <span style="font-weight: bold;">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</span><br
              style="font-weight: bold;">
            <br>
            This invention relates to an improved engine, and will have
            special application, but not necessarily so limited, to
            internal combustion engines which can be used in lawn mowers
            to diesel electricity generators.<br>
            <br>
            The engine embodied in this invention utilizes a dwelling
            scotch yoke and a journalled flywheel in a unique
            combination for stalling the translatory movement of
            oppositely paired pistons during the detonation of lean fuel
            mixture. A fixed volume is thus maintained above the piston
            during detonation, in which a complete chemical reaction of
            the fuel molecules and the rich air can occur. Consequently,
            the fuel mixture can be disassociated into its purer
            elements to achieve a very clean exhaust and a highly energy
            efficient engine.<br>
            <br>
            An additional feature of this engine is that it is compact
            and efficient in size and maintenance. The journalled
            flywheel obviates the use of a crankshaft and throws
            typically used in two and four cylinder engines. Further,
            the flywheel functions as an oil pump for supplying
            lubrication to the pistons. Each of the pistons have flared
            skirts to allow for better engine lubrication and to reduce
            heat warping, thus reducing wear.<br>
            <br>
            The engine also utilizes cylinders with sealed end walls.
            The cylinder bore by being enclosed at its lower end is
            separated from the crankcase internal chamber where the
            journalled flywheel and oil bath is located. The presence of
            the cylinder end wall functions to provide a barrier between
            the cylinder bore and the oil bath and also to allow for an
            increase in the density of the fuel mixture during piston
            movement. By increasing the density of the fuel mixture, it
            is more efficiently burned during the detonation process.<br>
            <br>
            Still another feature of the cylinder is the location and
            size of its exhaust ports. The exhaust ports are located
            such that the exhaust gases generated within the cylinder
            are not released until the piston completes its inward or
            power stroke. Thus, a longer power stroke is achieved
            resulting in increased horsepower than can be gained using
            conventional cylinders.<br>
            <br>
            Accordingly, an object of this invention is to provide an
            energy efficient engine.<br>
            <br>
            Another object of this invention is to provide an engine
            that produces environmentally favorable exhaust.<br>
            <br>
            Still another object of this invention is to provide an
            engine that can operate by burning various forms of fuels.<br>
            <br>
            Still another object is to provide an engine that is
            compact, lightweight, durable, easily assembled, and
            economical.<br>
            <br>
            Other objects will become apparent upon a reading of the
            following description.<br>

            <span style="font-weight: bold;">DESCRIPTION OF THE
              PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
            <br>
            The preferred embodiment herein described is not intended to
            be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the precise form
            disclosed. It is chosen and described to explain the
            principles of the invention and its application and
            practical use to enable others skilled in the art to utilize
            the invention.<br>
            <br>
            The preferred embodiment of the invention is a
            four-cylinder, two-stroke engine. The concepts that exist in
            this invention are applicable to other types of engines such
            as multiple-cylinder, four-stroke engines.<br>
            <br>
            Referring now to the drawings, FIG. 1 illustrates the
            preferred embodiment of the twin-opposing four--cylinder,
            two-stroke internal combustion engine 1. For descriptive
            purposes, engine I can be referred to as having similar
            halves sharing a flywheel 20. Thus, only one such engine
            half will be described in detail with similar reference
            numerals being used for like functioning components of both
            halves.<br>
            <br>
            Each engine half la, lb includes a pair of oppositely
            located pistons 10, a cylinder 26 for each piston 10, and a
            portion of a crankcase 50 supporting a journalled flywheel
            20 therein. Each crankcase half 50a, 50b includes an outer
            part 52 and an inner part 54 forming in conjunction with the
            other crankcase half a central chamber 102 for the internal
            components of engine 1. Outer part 52 and inner part 54 are
            fastened to other crankcase half by screws 94. Crankcase 50
            supports a journalled flywheel 20 in central chamber 102 by
            a bearing 104. Bearing 104 is seated in the cavity defined
            by inner parts 54 so as to support flywheel 20 and allow it
            to rotate about an axis perpendicular to the piston
            movement. Crankcase 50 has a side opening 21 for a sectored
            portion of flywheel 20 to mesh with a suitable power input
            gear (not shown). Additionally, outer part 52 and inner part
            54 form in conjunction the openings 53 for interfitting
            cylinder neck parts 28, as shown in FIG. 2.<br>
            <br>
            As shown in FIG. 14, each cylinder 26 includes a head part
            27 and a neck part 28. Each head part 27 includes top
            opening 31 for an interfitting spark plug 24, a lower
            annular lip 25 for interfitting with neck part 28 and which
            defines an opening 33 which is part of the cylinder bore 4,
            two exhaust ports 46 for allowing the discharge of the
            exhaust gases out of cylinder bore 4, diametrically located
            transfer ports 16 for allowing the passage of the fuel
            mixture from below the piston to above the piston and
            cooling flanges 30 for dissipating the heat generated within
            the head part, all as shown in FIG. 14. Each neck part 28
            has an annular recess 29 for accepting head part lip 25, an
            inlet port 14 for allowing the passage of the fuel mixture
            into the cylinder bore 4 below the piston, and necked collar
            part 100 for fitting into crankcase opening 53.<br>
            <br>
            Each cylinder 26 contains a piston 10 located in bore 4.
            Each piston 10 includes a skirt 76 with opposing slots 74
            and circumferential grooves 40, as shown in FIG. 6. Slots 74
            are for reducing the effects of heat warping upon each
            piston 10 and to allow skirt 76 to flare outwardly into
            contact with cylinder bore 4 so as to achieve a greater
            vacuum below the piston during engine operation. Rings 41
            are carried in grooves 40. The length of each piston 10 is
            preferably longer than the length of transfer ports 16.<br>
            <br>
            The pair of pistons 10 are coaxially interconnected by a
            yoke 42. Each piston 10 includes opposing lugs 75 which
            extend from the piston top wall 11 spacedly along the
            interior of skirt wall 76, as shown in FIG. 6. Lugs 75 have
            aligned holes 78. As shown in FIG. 5, a hollow retainer pin
            79 extends into each hole 78. Retainer pin 79 is held within
            piston 10 by a pair of washers 81 each placed over one end
            of the pin and is secured by a retainer screw 83 which
            extends through the hollow pin. A saddle 62 is pivotally
            carried between lugs 75 by retainer pin 79 inserted with
            clearance through the saddle piston hole 66. Saddle 62 has
            aligned wrist pin holes 70. Wrist pin 82 extends into each
            hole 70 and is held by a screw connection. A rod 12 is
            pivotally carried between the saddle walls 68 by wrist pins
            82 inserted with clearance through the rod wrist pin hole
            72. The end of rod 12 abuts against the saddle seat 64 for
            ensuring no longitudinal loading is experienced by wrist pin
            82 or skirt 76 during the power stroke of pistons 10.
            Clearance exists between rod 12 and saddle walls 68 for
            allowing lateral movement of piston 10 relative to rod 12 so
            as to achieve uniform piston wear. The oppositely aligned
            ends of rods 12 coaxially join a U-shaped cam member 43 to
            form yoke 42. Cam member 43 is located in internal chamber
            102. Each rod 12 extends from internal chamber 102 through
            the lower end wall 140, in which a hole 106 is provided in
            each neck part 28, and into cylinder bore 4.<br>
            <br>
            Each cam member 43 includes two side walls 110 and a back
            wall 112. Each side wall 110 defines an involuted cam or
            dwell cup 44, as shown in FIG. 6, herein described later.
            The center of each dwell cup 44 is referred to as either top
            dead center 44a or bottom dead center 44b. This nomenclature
            is relative to the position of each individual piston 10.
            For some applications of engine 1, dwell cups 44 can have
            varying curvatures as required to gain the desired engine
            efficiency during fuel detonation. This may be achieved by
            using an insert a shoe (not shown) in cam member 43 that has
            the desired shape of dwell cups 44. In this preferred
            embodiment dwell cups 44 have symmetrical curvatures. Back
            wall 112 of cam member 43 can be adapted for imparting
            auxiliary motion to a second machine through a suitable
            capped opening 130 in crank case 50.<br>
            <br>
            Each yoke 42 is connected to flywheel 20 through a cam
            follower 32, as shown in FIG. 2. Cam followers 32 form a
            part of flywheel 20 and are diametrically located on
            opposite sides of the flywheel within chamber 102. The
            contact surface of each cam follower 32 is in the form of a
            bearing 35. Each cam follower 32 fits with rolling clearance
            between side walls 110 of cam member 43.<br>
            <br>
            Lubricating oil is placed in chamber 102 for reducing
            friction wear of the engine components during operation. An
            oil passage 47 is provided in each inner part 54, connected
            to neck part 27 and head part 27. Passage begins at an inlet
            port 49 within internal chamber 102 and terminating in an
            outlet port 45 located in each cylinder bore 4, as shown in
            FIG. 4. Each outlet port 45 is located so piston rings 41
            are lubricated as piston 10 reaches the bottom of its
            stroke, as shown in FIG. 3. During the operation of engine
            1, the movement of the internal components located in
            crankcase 50 act as a pump forcing the oil in chamber 102
            into inlet port 49, along passage 47, out each port 45 and
            onto rings 41. Negative pressure created from piston 10
            movement aids in drawing the oil onto rings 41. The flaring
            of piston skirt 76 serves to obstruct the release of oil
            into bore 4 when rings 41 are not in contact with inlet port
            45.<br>
            <br>
            Each yoke rod 12 is necked at the cam member junction 114
            for preventing oil in chamber 102 from being injected into
            cylinder bore 4 through opening 106 during engine 1
            operation. A seal 107 is located at opening 106 of each neck
            28 and extends about rod 12 to also assists in obstructing
            oil from being pumped into cylinder bore 4. Cylinder bore 4
            is also sealed at its innermost end by its neck part 28.<br>
            <br>
            In the operation of engine 1, pistons 10 act in concert to
            rotate flywheel 20 by means of yokes 42. Each yoke 42 serves
            to translate the longitudinal coaxial motion of each pair of
            opposed pistons 10 into rotational movement of flywheel 20.
            This occurs when a piston 10 moves down cylinder bore 4
            thereby pushing yoke 42 along its longitudinal axis. As each
            yoke 42 is moved it carries with it the connected cam
            follower 32, thus causing flywheel 20 to rotate. Flywheel 20
            will rotate 360.degree. about its axis as each yoke 42 is
            pushed down and back.<br>
            <br>
            Piston 10 movement occurs upon the detonation of a fuel
            mixture 120 in cylinder 26. Fuel mixture 120 cycles through
            each cylinder bore 4 in the following manner. The first
            outward stroke of each piston 10 causes a negative pressure
            below the piston to draw fuel mixture 120 from inlet port 14
            into cylinder bore 4, as shown in FIG. 10. The following
            inward stroke of piston 10 forces fuel mixture 120 from
            below the piston into transfer ports 16, as shown in FIG.
            12. When piston 10 reaches the bottom of cylinder bore 4,
            transfer ports 16 open above the piston and allows the
            pressurized fuel mixture 120 to flow into the area above the
            piston, as shown in FIG. 13. The succeeding outward stroke
            of piston 10 further compresses fuel mixture 120 above the
            piston, as shown in FIG. 11. When piston 10 reaches the top
            of cylinder bore 4, fuel mixture 120 is detonated by a spark
            from sparkplug 24. The subsequent explosion causes piston 10
            to move inwardly; this motion is commonly referred to as the
            power stroke. As piston 10 reaches the bottom of cylinder
            bore 4 during its power stroke, exhaust ports 46 open to
            allow the burnt or exhaust gases 122 to expand and flow out
            of cylinder bore 4 through exhaust ports 46, clearing it to
            receive nearly simultaneously a fresh charge of fuel mixture
            120, as shown in FIG. 13. The cycle is then repeated.<br>
            <br>
            The presence of dwell cups 44 in yokes 42 increases the
            engine's horsepower by regulating the movement of pistons
            10. The outward movement of each piston 10 is substantially
            stopped when its associated cam follower 32 travels along
            the concave surface of dwell cup 44 during the power stroke
            of its oppositely located, paired piston. By stopping piston
            movement at the top its compression/detonation stroke, fuel
            mixture 120 is compressed into a fixed volume and can
            experience a substantively complete burn before the piston
            moves and enters its power or inward stroke. Further,
            hydrocarbons or nitrous oxides are reduced and sometimes
            even eliminated from exhaust gases 122, because the fuel
            mixture 120 is more thoroughly consumed. Thus, contamination
            of subsequent fresh charges fuel mixture 120 entering into
            cylinder bore 4 by unburned hydrocarbons will be reduced and
            perhaps even eliminated.<br>
            <br>
            This process begins when each cam follower 32 reaches the
            cam or concave surface of its associated top dwell cup 44a
            at -30.degree. There, fuel mixture 120 is ignited. For
            60.degree. of rotation, cam follower 32 travels along the
            dwell cup surface which is curved to match the radial
            sectored movement of the cam follower, stopping the movement
            of piston 10 while fuel mixture 120 is consumed. At
            +30.degree., piston 10 begins its power stroke, as shown in
            FIG. 8. The expansive forces created from the detonation of
            fuel mixture 120 moves piston 10 inward, pushing yoke 42
            against cam follower 32 which turns flywheel 20. When cam
            follower 32 reaches 150.degree., it begins to travel along
            the bottom dwell cup 44b, as shown in FIG. 9. Piston 10 will
            again be substantially stopped in movement for 60.degree.
            until cam follower 32 reaches 210.degree.. This allows the
            detonation process to occur in the opposite cylinder 26.
            Piston 10 then begins its succeeding outward stroke once cam
            follower 32 reaches 210.degree. and is forced out along
            cylinder bore 4 into its compression/detonation stroke by
            the connected opposite paired piston 10 which is being
            forced inward during its own power stroke.<br>
            <br>
            Each pair of pistons 10 has two power strokes (one for each
            piston) per revolution of flywheel 20. Each piston pair
            operate in synchronous translation and 180.degree. out of
            phase with the other pair of pistons. Thus, fuel mixture
            detonation occurs at each piston 10 in its outermost
            position simultaneously. Hence, the outermost piston 10 of
            one piston pair will be in its power stroke as the offset
            oppositely located outward piston 10 of the other piston
            pair is also in its power stroke, and in concert, the two
            pistons will function to rotate flywheel 20.<br>
            <br>
            The presence of cylinder end wall 140 also serves to
            maximize engine's 1 creatable horsepower by increasing the
            density of fuel mixture 120. Because cylinder bore is
            enclosed at its lower end and thus separated from internal
            chamber 102, fuel mixture 120 achieves a greater density
            when being compressed into transfer ports 16 than
            conventional engines. Thus, when fuel mixture 120 is
            consumed, the increase in density equates to an increase in
            generated power. The thickness of cylinder end wall 140
            thickness can be varied by installing specially machined
            neck parts 28 so as to alter the fuel mixture density as
            desired.<br>
            <br>
            The location and size of exhaust ports 46 serves to maximize
            the amount of horsepower piston 10 can generate during its
            power stroke. Exhaust ports 46 are positioned to open when
            the opposite paired piston 10 begins detonation. Thus, a
            longer power stroke is achieved resulting in increased
            horsepower than can be gained using conventional cylinders.<br>
            <br>
            During operation of engine 1, noise generated by yoke 42
            impacting against cam follower 32 is reduced because of the
            presence of dwell cups 44. Also during the operation of
            engine 1, yoke 42 may have a tendency to rotate about the
            longitudinal axis during translation. An I-beam 5 is
            fastened to each crankcase cover 6 so as to prevent such
            rotation.<br>
