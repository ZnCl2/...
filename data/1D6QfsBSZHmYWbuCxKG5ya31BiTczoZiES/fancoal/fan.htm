      "Ohio State students have come up with a scaled-down version of a
      power plant combustion system with a unique experimental
      design--one that chemically converts coal to heat while capturing
      99 percent of the carbon dioxide produced in the reaction. Typical
      coal-fired power plants burn coal to heat water to make steam,
      which turns the turbines that produce electricity. In chemical
      looping, the coal isn't burned with fire, but instead chemically
      combusted in a sealed chamber so that it doesn't pollute the air.
      This new technology, called coal-direct chemical looping, was
      pioneered by Liang-Shih Fan, professor of chemical and
      biomolecular engineering and director of Ohio State's Clean Coal

      COLUMBUS, Ohio—A new form of clean coal technology reached an
      important milestone recently, with the successful operation of a
      research-scale combustion system at Ohio State University. The
      technology is now ready for testing at a larger scale.<br>
      <br>
      For 203 continuous hours, the Ohio State combustion unit produced
      heat from coal while capturing 99 percent of the carbon dioxide
      produced in the reaction.<br>
      <br>
      Liang-Shih Fan, professor of chemical and biomolecular engineering
      and director of Ohio State’s Clean Coal Research Laboratory,
      pioneered the technology called Coal-Direct Chemical Looping
      (CDCL), which chemically harnesses coal’s energy and efficiently
      contains the carbon dioxide produced before it can be released
      into the atmosphere.<br>
      <br>
      “In the simplest sense, combustion is a chemical reaction that
      consumes oxygen and produces heat,” Fan said. “Unfortunately, it
      also produces carbon dioxide, which is difficult to capture and
      bad for the environment. So we found a way to release the heat
      without burning. We carefully control the chemical reaction so
      that the coal never burns—it is consumed chemically, and the
      carbon dioxide is entirely contained inside the reactor.”<br>
      <br>
      Dawei Wang, a research associate and one of the group's team
      leaders, described the technology’s potential benefits. "The
      commercial-scale CDCL plant could really promote our energy
      independence. Not only can we use America's natural resources such
      as Ohio coal, but we can keep our air clean and spur the economy
      with jobs," he said.<br>
      <br>
      “We carefully control the chemical reaction so that the coal never
      burns—it is consumed chemically, and the carbon dioxide is
      entirely contained inside the reactor.”<br>
      <br>
      Though other laboratories around the world are trying to develop
      similar technology to directly convert coal to electricity, Fan’s
      lab is unique in the way it processes fossil fuels. The Ohio State
      group typically studies coal in the two forms that are already
      commonly available to the power industry: crushed coal
      “feedstock,” and coal-derived syngas.<br>
      <br>
      The latter fuel has been successfully studied in a second
      sub-pilot research-scale unit, through a similar process called
      Syngas Chemical Looping (SCL).&nbsp; Both units are located in a
      building on Ohio State’s Columbus campus, and each is contained in
      a 25-foot-high insulated metal cylinder that resembles a very tall
      home water heater tank.<br>
      <br>
      No other lab has continuously operated a coal-direct chemical
      looping unit as long as the Ohio State lab did last September. But
      as doctoral student Elena Chung explained, the experiment could
      have continued.<br>
      <br>
      “We voluntarily chose to stop the unit. We actually could have run
      longer, but honestly, it was a mutual decision by Dr. Fan and the
      students. It was a long and tiring week where we all shared
      shifts,” she said.<br>
      <br>
      Fan agreed that the nine-day experiment was a success. “In the two
      years we’ve been running the sub-pilot plants, our CDCL and SCL
      units have achieved a combined 830 operating hours, which clearly
      demonstrates the reliability and operability of our design,” he
      said.<br>
      <br>
      At any one time, the units each produce about 25 thermal
      kilowatts—that is, thermal energy, which in a full-scale power
      plant would be used to heat water and turn the steam-powered
      turbines that create electricity.<br>
      <br>
      The researchers are about to take their technology to the next
      level: a larger-scale pilot plant is under construction at the
      U.S. Department of Energy’s National Carbon Capture Center in
      Wilsonville, AL. Set to begin operations in late 2013, that plant
      will produce 250 thermal kilowatts using syngas.<br>
      <br>
      The key to the technology is the use of tiny metal beads to carry
      oxygen to the fuel to spur the chemical reaction. For CDCL, the
      fuel is coal that’s been ground into a powder, and the metal beads
      are made of iron oxide composites. The coal particles are about
      100 micrometers across—about the diameter of a human hair—and the
      iron beads are larger, about 1.5-2 millimeters across. Chung
      likened the two different sizes to talcum powder and ice cream
      sprinkles, though the mix is not nearly so colorful.<br>
      <br>
      The coal and iron oxide are heated to high temperatures, where the
      materials react with each other. Carbon from the coal binds with
      the oxygen from the iron oxide and creates carbon dioxide, which
      rises into a chamber where it is captured. Hot iron and coal ash
      are left behind. Because the iron beads are so much bigger than
      the coal ash, they are easily separated out of the ash, and
      delivered to a chamber where the heat energy would normally be
      harnessed for electricity. The coal ash is removed from the
      system.<br>
      <br>
      The carbon dioxide is separated and can be recycled or sequestered
      for storage.&nbsp; The iron beads are exposed to air inside the
      reactor, so that they become re-oxidized&nbsp; be used again. The
      beads can be re-used almost indefinitely, or recycled.<br>
      <br>
      Since the process captures nearly all the carbon dioxide, it
      exceeds the goals that DOE has set for developing clean energy.
      New technologies that use fossil fuels should not raise the cost
      of electricity more than 35 percent, while still capturing more
      than 90 percent of the resulting carbon dioxide. Based on the
      current tests with the research-scale plants, Fan and his team
      believe that they can meet or exceed that requirement.<br>
      <br>

      Babcock &amp; Wilcox Power Generation Group, Inc.; CONSOL Energy,
      Inc.; and Clear Skies Consulting, LLC.<br>

      [0002] The present invention is generally directed to systems and
      methods of converting fuel, and is generally directed to
      oxidation-reduction reactor systems used in fuel conversion.<br>
      <br>
      [0003] There is a constant need for clean and efficient energy
      generation systems. Most of the commercial processes that generate
      energy carriers such as steam, hydrogen, synthesis gas (syngas),
      liquid fuels and/or electricity are based on fossil fuels.
      Furthermore, the dependence on fossil fuels is expected to
      continue in the foreseeable future due to the much lower costs
      compared to renewable sources. Currently, the conversion of
      carbonaceous fuels such as coal, natural gas, petroleum coke is
      usually conducted through a combustion or reforming process.
      However, combustion of carbonaceous fuels, especially coal, is a
      carbon intensive process that emits large quantities of carbon
      dioxide to the environment. Sulfur and nitrogen compounds are also
      generated in this process due to the complex content in coal.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] Chemical reactions between metal oxides and carbonaceous
      fuels, on the other hand, may provide a better way to recover the
      energy stored in the fuels. Several processes are based on the
      reaction of metal oxide particles with carbonaceous fuels to
      produce useful energy carriers. For example, Ishida et al. U.S.
      Pat. No. 5,447,024 describes processes wherein nickel oxide
      particles are used to convert natural gas through a chemical
      looping process into heat, which may be used in a turbine.
      However, recyclability of pure metal oxides is poor and
      constitutes an impediment for its use in commercial and industrial
      processes. Moreover, this technology has limited applicability,
      because it can only convert natural gas, which is more costly than
      other fossil fuels. Another well known process is a steam-iron
      process, wherein coal derived producer gas is reacted with iron
      oxide parlicles in a fiuidized bed reactor to be later regenerated
      with steam to produce hydrogen gas. This process however suffers
      from poor gas conversion -0-<br>
      <br>
      [0005] rates due to improper contact between reacting solids and
      gases, and is incapable of producing a hydrogen rich stream.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] As demands increase for cleaner and more efficient systems
      of converting fuel, the need arises for improved systems, and
      system components therein, which will convert fuel effectively,
      while reducing pollutants.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] In one embodiment of the present invention, a system for
      converting fuel is provided. The system comprises a first reactor
      comprising a plurality of ceramic composite particles, wherein the
      ceramic composite particles comprise at least one metal oxide
      disposed on a support. The first reactor is configured to reduce
      at least one metal oxide with a fuel to produce a reduced metal or
      a reduced metal oxide. The system also comprises a second reactor
      configured to oxidize the reduced metal or reduced metal oxide to
      produce a metal oxide intermediate, and a third reactor configured
      to regenerate at least one metal oxide by oxidizing the metal
      oxide intermediate.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] In another embodiment of the present invention, a method of
      converting fuel to hydrogen, CO, or syngas is provided. The method
      comprises the steps of: reducing a metal oxide in a reduction
      reaction between a fuel and a metal oxide to a reduced metal or a
      reduced metal oxide; oxidizing the reduced metal or reduced metal
      oxide with an oxidant to a metal oxide intermediate, while also
      producing hydrogen, CO, or syngas; and regenerating the at least
      one metal oxide by oxidizing the metal oxide intermediate.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] In yet another embodiment, a system comprising a
      Fischer-Tropsch reactor is provided. The Fischer-Tropsch reactor
      is configured to produce hydrocarbon fuel from a feed mixture
      comprising gaseous fuel. The system also comprises a first reactor
      comprising a plurality of ceramic composite particles, wherein the
      ceramic composite particles comprise at least one metal oxide
      disposed on a support. The first reactor is configured to reduce
      the metal oxides with a gaseous fuel to a reduced metal or a
      reduced metal oxide, wherein the gaseous fuel comprises at least
      partially the hydrocarbon fuel produced by the Fischer-Tropsch
      reactor. The system also comprises a second reactor configured to
      oxidize the reduced metal or reduced metal oxide with steam to
      produce metal oxide intermediates.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] In another embodiment, a method of preparing ceramic
      composite particles is provided. The method comprises reacting a
      metal oxide with a support material; heat treating the mixture of
      metal oxide and support material at temperatures of between about
      200 to about 1500 &lt;0&gt;C to produce ceramic composite powders;
      converting the ceramic composite powders into ceramic composite
      particles; and reducing and oxidizing the ceramic composite
      particles prior to use in a reactor...<br>

      <b>BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0003] The disclosed embodiments includes a process for producing
      hydrogen, comprising the steps of: (a) gasifying a fuel into a raw
      synthesis gas comprising CO, hydrogen, steam and sulfur and halide
      contaminants in the form of H2S, COS and HX, where X is a halide;
      (b) passing the raw synthesis gas through a water gas shift
      reactor (WGSR) into which CaO and steam are injected, the CaO
      reacting with the shifted gas to remove CO2, sulfur and halides in
      a solid-phase calcium-containing product comprising CaCO3, CaS and
      CaX2; (c) separating the solid-phase calcium-containing product
      from an enriched gaseous hydrogen product; and (d) regenerating
      the CaO by calcining the solid-phase calcium-containing product at
      a condition selected from the group consisting of: in the presence
      of steam, in the presence of CO2, in the presence of synthesis
      gas, in the presence of H2 and O2, under partial vacuum, and
      combinations thereof.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] The fuel could be coal, biomass, oil sands, coke, tar, wax
      oil shales, or combinations of these materials.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] Although the steam may be injected into the WGSR in any
      functional quantity, it is preferred that the steam injected is in
      the range of from about the stoichiometric requirement to about 3
      times the stoichiometric requirement.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] In one embodiment, the enriched hydrogen product has a
      purity of at least 60%. In one embodiment, the H2:CO ratio of the
      enriched hydrogen product is in the range of from about 0.5:1 to
      about 1000:1. In some embodiments the enriched hydrogen product
      has a purity in the range of from about 70% to about 99.99%, at
      temperature in the range of from about 400-1000 C, and a pressure
      in the range of from about 1 to about 100 atmospheres.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] The WGSR may be of a type selected from the group
      consisting of: fixed bed reactors, fluidized bed reactors,
      entrained flow reactors, moving bed reactors rotary kilns, or
      combinations thereof. Additionally, the calcinations step may be
      performed in a calcinations reactor of a type selected from the
      group consisting of: fixed bed reactors, fluidized bed reactors,
      entrained flow reactors, moving bed reactors rotary kilns, or
      combinations thereof.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] In some embodiments, the WGSR does not have a catalyst
      disposed therein. As such the WGSR operates at a temperature in
      the range of from about 550-750 C, in the pressure range of from
      about 1 to about 60 atm, it is preferred that the WGSR reactor
      operate in a temperature range of from about 600-700 C and at a
      pressure in the range of from about 20 to about 30 atm. In some
      embodiments, the enriched hydrogen product is 99% pure when 3
      times the stoichiometric steam requirement is used. At the
      stoichiometric steam requirement the process produces an enriched
      hydrogen product that is 90% pure. In another catalytic
      embodiment, the enriched hydrogen product has a H2/Co ration of at
      least 2.5 and a maximum sulfur (H2S/COS) concentration of less
      than 10 ppm using only the stoichiometric requirement of steam.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] In some embodiments, a catalyst may be used in the WGSR. A
      suitable high temperature shift catalyst which may include: Fe,
      Cu, Co, Mo, W, Cs, Pt, Ph, Pd, and other precious metal catalysts
      or their oxides or sulfides or combinations thereof. Suitable
      supports for use with the foregoing high temperature shift
      catalysts include: Cr2O3, ZnO, MgO, ceria, alumina, silica,
      zirconia and combinations thereof.<br>
      <br>
      [0000] A WGSR reactor with a catalyst operates in the temperature
      range of from about 550-750 C and at a pressure in the range of
      from about 1 to about 100 atm. It is preferred that the WGSR
      reactor operate in the temperature range of from about 600-700 C
      and at a pressure of from about 20 to about 30 amt. When a
      catalyst is used the enriched hydrogen product may achieve 99.99%
      purity when 3* the stoichiometric requirement of steam is used in
      the WGSR. The enriched hydrogen product may achieve 98% purity
      when the stoichiometric requirement of steam is used. Some
      embodiments may attain a purity of at least 80% with a maximum
      sulfur (H2S/COS) concentration of less than 10 ppm when 3* the
      stoichiometric requirement of steam is used and at least 70%
      purity with a maximum sulfur concentration of less than 1 ppm when
      the stoichiometric requirement of steam is used.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] The process may also comprise the step of (e) recycling at
      least a portion of a product stream from a Fischer-Tropsch
      reactor, fed by the WGSR, so as to introduce a chemical species
      selected from the group consisting of: methane, C1-C4
      hydrocarbons, CO, hydrogen and combinations thereof back into the
      WGSR.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] In all embodiments, the CaO may have a surface area of at
      least 12.0 m2/g and a pore volume of at least 0.015 cm3/g, said
      CaO having a sorption capacity of at least about 70 grams of CO2
      per kilogram of CaO.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] The CaO may be provided in any usable form including, but
      not limited to, pellets, granules, fines, monoliths and
      combinations thereof. The CaO may be obtained by processing
      chicken eggshells.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] Although the regeneration of CaO step may be performed any
      functional process, it is preferred that it is conducted by a
      process selected from the group consisting of: (a) calcining in
      the presence of steam and/or CO2 and/or H2 with O2, and/or
      synthesis gas with O2 and/or under partial vacuum or combinations
      thereof; (b) a process in which the heat is added to the calciner
      using steam and a combination of calciner fuel and oxidant; (c) a
      process in which the calciner fuel is H2 or natural gas or
      synthesis gas or coal or combinations thereof; (d) a process in
      which the oxidant is air or oxygen or combinations thereof; (e) a
      process in which heat is provided to the calciner directly or
      indirectly; (f) calciner reactor temperatures ranging from about
      700-1100 C; and (a process for adjusting the calciner temperature
      by modifying the CaO to CaCO3 ratio in the calciner. The gas phase
      product from the calciner may comprise pure CO2 and could also
      contain trace amounts of H2S.<br>
      <br>
      [0014] The disclosed embodiments also includes a process for
      producing hydrogen, comprising the steps of: (a) reforming a
      gaseous hydrocarbon fuel in the presence of CaO and steam to
      remove CO2, sulfur and halide contaminants in the form of H2S, COS
      and HX, where X is a halide, in a solid-phase calcium-containing
      product comprising CaCO3, CaS and CaX2, thereby producing a
      mixture of CO and hydrogen; (b) separating the solid-phase
      calcium-containing product from an enriched gaseous hydrogen
      product; and (c) regenerating the CaO by calcining the solid-phase
      calcium-containing product at a condition selected from the group
      consisting of: in the presence of steam, in the presence of CO2,
      in the presence of synthesis gas, in the presence of H2 and O2,
      under partial vacuum, and combinations thereof.<br>
      <br>
      [0015] The gaseous fuel may be natural gas, C1-C4 hydrocarbons, or
      mixtures thereof. The reforming step may involve the introduction
      of CO2, so called dry reforming.<br>
      <br>
      [0016] The reforming step may involve a reforming catalyst.
      Suitable reforming catalysts include those comprising: Ni, Pt, Rh,
      Pd, Ru, W, Mo, their oxide or carbides or sulfides. The reforming
      catalyst may use a support. Suitable supports for use with the
      foregoing reforming or pre-reforming catalysts include: alumina,
      silica, titania, zirconia, and combinations thereof. It is
      preferred that the reforming catalyst is sulfur intolerant.<br>
      <br>
      [0017] The reforming operation may occur in a temperature range of
      from about 550 to about 750 C. and at a pressure in the range of
      from about 1 to about 60 atm. Preferably, it operates in the
      temperature range of from about 600 to about 70[deg.] C. and at a
      pressure in the range of from about 20 to about 30 atm.<br>
      <br>
      [0018] The enriched hydrogen product produced may be as pure as
      99.9% when 3* the stoichiometric requirement of steam is used and
      95% pure when the stoichiometric requirement of steam is used.<br>
      <br>
      [0019] This process may additionally comprise the step of: (d)
      recycling at least a portion of a product stream from a
      Fischer-Tropsch reactor, fed by the reformer, so as to introduce a
      chemical species selected from the group consisting of: methane,
      C1-C4 hydrocarbons, CO, hydrogen and combinations thereof back
      into the reformer.<br>
      <br>
      [0020] In all embodiments, the CaO may have a surface area of at
      least 12.0 m2/g and a pore volume of at least 0.015 cm3/g, said
      CaO having a sorption capacity of at least about 70 grams of CO2
      per kilogram of CaO.<br>
      <br>
      [0021] The CaO may be provided in any usable form including, but
      not limited to, pellets, granules, fines, monoliths and
      combinations thereof. The CaO may be obtained by processing
      chicken eggshells.<br>
      <br>
      [0022] When a catalyst is used the enriched hydrogen product may
      achieve 99.99% purity when 3* the stoichiometric requirement of
      steam is used. The enriched hydrogen product may achieve 98%
      purity when the stoichiometric requirement of steam is used. Some
      embodiments may attain a purity of at least 80% with a maximum
      sulfur (H2S/COS) concentration of less than 10 ppm when 3* the
      stoichiometric requirement of steam is used and at least 70%
      purity with a maximum sulfur concentration of less than 1 ppm when
      the stoichiometric requirement of steam is used. The process
      allows for a hydrogen purity of at least 80% with a maximum sulfur
      (H2S/COS) concentration of less than 10 ppm when 3* the
      stoichiometric requirement of steam is used and at least 70%
      purity with a maximum sulfur concentration of less than 1 ppm when
      the stoichiometric requirement of steam is used.<br>
      <br>
      [0023] Another process of the disclosed embodiments for producing
      hydrogen, comprising the steps of: (a) at least partially
      oxidizing a fuel into a raw gas comprising CO, hydrogen, steam and
      sulfur and halide contaminants in the form of H2S, COS and HX,
      where X is a halide; (b) passing the raw gas through a water gas
      shift reactor (WGSR) into which CaO and steam are injected, the
      CaO reacting with the shifted gas to remove CO2, sulfur and
      halides in a solid-phase calcium-containing product comprising
      CaCO3, CaS and CaX2; (c) separating the solid-phase
      calcium-containing product from an enriched gaseous hydrogen
      product; and (d) regenerating the CaO by calcining the solid-phase
      calcium-containing product at a condition selected from the group
      consisting of: in the presence of steam, in the presence of CO2,
      in the presence of synthesis gas, in the presence of H2 and O2,
      under partial vacuum, and combinations thereof.<br>
      <br>
      [0024] In all embodiments, the CaO may have a surface area of at
      least 12.0 m2/g and a pore volume of at least 0.015 cm3/g, said
      CaO having a sorption capacity of at least about 70 grams of CO2
      per kilogram of CaO.<br>
      <br>
      [0025] The CaO may be provided in any usable form including, but
      not limited to, pellets, granules, fine, monoliths and
      combinations thereof. The CaO may be obtained by processing
      chicken eggshells.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] Although the steam may be injected into the WGSR in any
      functional quantity, it is preferred that the steam injected is in
      the range of from about the stoichiometric requirement to about 3
      times the stoichiometric requirement.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] The WGSR may be of a type selected from the group
      consisting of: fixed bed reactors, fluidized bed reactors,
      entrained flow reactors, moving bed reactors rotary kilns, or
      combinations thereof. Additionally, the calcinations step may be
      performed in a calcinations reactor of a type selected from the
      group consisting of: fixed bed reactors, fluidized bed reactors,
      entrained flow reactors, moving bed reactors rotary kilns, or
      combinations thereof.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] In some embodiments, the WGSR does not have a catalyst
      disposed therein. As such the WGSR operates at a temperature in
      the range of from about 550-750 C, in the pressure range of from
      about 1 to about 60 atm, it is preferred that the WGSR reactor
      operate in a temperature range of from about 600-700 C and at a
      pressure in the range of from about 20 to about 30 atm. In some
      embodiments, the enriched hydrogen product is 99% pure when 3
      times the stoichiometric steam requirement is used. At the
      stoichiometric steam requirement the process produces an enriched
      hydrogen product that is 90% pure. In another catalytic
      embodiment, the enriched hydrogen product has a H2/Co ratio of at
      least 2.5 and a maximum sulfur (H2S/COS) concentration of less
      than 10 ppm using only the stoichiometric requirement of steam.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] In some embodiments, a catalyst may be used in the WGSR. A
      suitable high temperature shift catalyst which may include: Fe,
      Cu, Co, Mo, W, Cs, Pt, Ph, Pd, and other precious metal catalysts
      or their oxides or sulfides or combinations thereof. Suitable
      supports for use with the foregoing high temperature shift
      catalysts include: Cr2O3, ZnO, MgO, ceria, alumina, silica,
      zirconia and combinations thereof.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] A WGSR reactor with a catalyst operates in the temperature
      range of from about 550-750 C and at a pressure in the range of
      from about 1 to about 100 atm. It is preferred that the WGSR
      reactor operate in the temperature range of from about 600-700 C
      and at a pressure of from about 20 to about 30 atm. When a
      catalyst is used the enriched hydrogen product may achieve 99.99%
      purity when 3* the stoichiometric requirement of steam is used in
      the WGSR. The enriched hydrogen product may achieve 98% purity
      when the stoichiometric requirement of steam is used. Some
      embodiments may attain a purity of at least 80% with a maximum
      sulfur (H2S/COS) concentration of less than 10 ppm when 3* the
      stoichiometric requirement of steam is used and at least 70%
      purity with a maximum sulfur concentration of less than 1 ppm when
      the stoichiometric requirement of steam is used...<br>

      A system for converting fuel is provided and includes a first
      reactor comprising a plurality of ceramic composite particles, the
      ceramic composite particles comprising at least one metal oxide
      disposed on a support, wherein the first reactor is configured to
      reduce the at least one metal oxide with a fuel to produce a
      reduced metal or a reduced metal oxide; a second reactor
      configured to oxidize at least a portion of the reduced metal or
      reduced metal oxide from the said first reactor to produce a metal
      oxide intermediate; a source of air; and a third reactor
      communicating with said source of air and configured to regenerate
      the at least one metal oxide from the remaining portion of the
      solids discharged from the said first reactor and the solids
      discharged from the said second reactor by oxidizing the metal
      oxide intermediate.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention is generally directed to systems and methods
      of converting carbonaceous fuels. Reduction- Oxidation (redox)
      reactions, with the presence of one or more chemical
      intermediates, are generally utilized to convert the carbonaceous
      fuels.<br>
      <br>
      In order to meet the ever increasing demand for clean and
      affordable energy carriers and to ensure the sustainable growth of
      modern economy, efficient and environmentally friendly
      technologies that convert carbonaceous fuels such as coal, crude
      oil, natural gas, biomass, tar sands, and oil shale into carbon
      free energy carriers are highly desirable. An energy carrier is a
      substance or phenomenon that can be used to produce mechanical
      work or heat or to operate chemical or physical processes.<br>
      <br>
      Existing carbonaceous fuel conversion technologies are either
      capital intensive (gasification or ultra-supercritical pulverized
      coal combustion), have low efficiencies (sub- critical pulverized
      coal combustion), or both, especially when CO2 regulation is
      mandatory.<br>
      <br>
      Chemical reactions between carbonaceous fuels and air/steam/CO2
      through the assistance of a metal oxide medium may represent an
      effective way to convert the fuels. A number of techniques have
      been proposed to convert carbonaceous fuels using metal oxide. For
      example, Watkins, U.S. Patent No. 3,027,238, describes a method
      for producing hydrogen gas including reducing a metal oxide in a
      reducing zone, and oxidizing the reduced metal with steam to
      produce hydrogen in an oxidizing zone. Thomas et al., U.S.
      Published Application No. 2005/0175533, and Fan et al., PCT
      Application No. WO 2007/082089, both describe methods for
      producing hydrogen gas by reducing a metal oxide in a reduction
      reaction between a carbon-based fuel and a metal oxide to provide
      a reduced metal or metal oxide having a lower oxidation state, and
      oxidizing the reduced metal or metal oxide to produce hydrogen and
      a metal oxide having a higher oxidation state. The metal or metal
      oxide is provided in the form of a porous composite of a ceramic
      material containing the metal or metal oxide. A well known process
      is a steam-iron process wherein coal-derived producer gas is
      reacted with iron oxide particles to be later regenerated with
      steam to produce hydrogen gas. However, a fluidized bed is used in
      this system which causes iron (Fe) to loop between FeO and Fe3U4,
      the gas is not fully converted, and no pure gas stream can be
      produced. Ishida et al., U.S. Patent No. 5,447,024, describes
      processes that make use of nickel oxide particles to convert
      natural gas through a chemical looping process into heat to be
      used in a turbine. However, this technology has limited
      applicability because it can only convert costly natural gas into
      heat/electricity. Therefore, both the feedstock and the product of
      the process are restricted.<br>
      <br>
      With increasing demand for cleaner and more efficient energy
      carriers such as electricity, hydrogen, and fuels, the need arises
      for improved systems, and system components therein, which produce
      the aforementioned energy carriers with higher efficiency and
      lower emissions.<br>
      <br>
      Embodiments of the present invention provide novel systems and
      processes for converting solid, liquid, and gaseous fuels into
      efficient energy carriers. In one embodiment, a system for
      converting solid, liquid, or gaseous fuel is provided and
      comprises a first reactor comprising a plurality of ceramic
      composite particles. The ceramic composite particles comprise at
      least one metal oxide disposed on a support, and the first reactor
      is configured to reduce the at least one metal oxide with a fuel
      to produce a reduced metal or a reduced metal oxide. The system
      includes a second reactor configured to at least partially
      re-oxidize the reduced metal or reduced metal oxide to produce a
      metal oxide intermediate. The system also includes a source of air
      and a third reactor communicating with the source of air and
      configured to regenerate the at least one metal oxide by oxidizing
      the metal oxide intermediate. In a preferred form, the fuel is a
      solid fuel or a gaseous fuel. Optionally, a fuel conversion
      enhancement gas, preferably including CO2, steam, and/or H2, is
      sent to the first reactor in which the gas flows countercurrently
      to the flow of solids. Also provided is a method of preparing
      ceramic composite particles, for example in the form of pellets,
      comprising the steps of, mixing a metal oxide with at least one
      ceramic material to form a mixture, granulating the mixture, and
      drying the granulated mixture. The dried, granulated mixture is
      processed into particle form such that the characteristic length
      of the particles is greater than about 200 [mu]m. The particles
      are heat treated at a temperature of from about 500 to about
      1500&lt;0&gt;C and optionally may be reduced and oxidized prior to
      use in the reactor system.<br>

      <b>BACKGROUND</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0002] Since the industrial revolution, the amount of CO2 in the
      atmosphere has risen from 280 ppm in 1800 to 370 ppm in 2000,
      mainly due to the consumption of fossil fuels. More than half of
      the energy used in the United States comes from the use of coal,
      and it is mostly used to generate electricity. Unfortunately, CO2
      is one of the greenhouse gases considered to be responsible for
      global warming. Moreover, the increased atmospheric CO2
      concentration will acidify the ocean and will change the chemistry
      of the surface ocean, leading to a potentially detrimental impact
      on the ecosystem. In order to meet the ever- increasing global
      energy demands, while stabilizing the atmospheric CO2 level,
      current carbon emissions should be significantly reduced.<br>
      <br>
      [0003] There have been significant research and development
      activities in the area of carbon capture and storage (CCS),
      including a number of integrated technologies (e.g., chemical
      looping processes) to combine CO2 capture with
      electricity/chemical/fuel production. Chemical looping processes
      involve a sorbent, typically a metal, or more likely a low
      oxidation state metal oxide that can be oxidized in air. The oxide
      is reduced by carbonaceous fuels in a subsequent step. A variation
      of this approach oxidizes the metal not in air but in a chemical
      reaction with steam to produce a pure stream of H2. The chemical
      looping processes also allow the inherent generation of the
      sequestration-ready CO2 stream at higher pressures.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] Once captured, CO2 can be stored via geological
      sequestration, ocean disposal, mineral carbonation, and biological
      fixation. The mineral sequestration scheme is particularly
      attractive, since this process converts CO2 into thermodynamically
      stable carbonates via the reaction of CO2 with widely available
      non-carbonate minerals, such as serpentine and olivine. Therefore,
      the mineral sequestration process eliminates the risk of
      accidental CO2 releases. The reaction underlining mineral
      carbonation mimics natural chemical transformations of CO2, such
      as the weathering of rocks. The main challenges of this storage
      method have been the slow dissolution kinetics and large energy
      requirement associated with the mineral processing.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0005] The previously developed pH swing carbon mineral
      sequestration immobilizes the gaseous CO2 into a thermodynamically
      stable solid, MgCO3, using Mg-bearing minerals such as serpentine.
      This mineral carbonation technology is particularly promising
      since it generates value-added solid products: high surface area
      silica, iron oxide, and magnesium carbonate, while providing a
      safe and permanent storage option for CO2. By carefully
      controlling the pH of the system, these solids products can be
      produced with high purity. The disclosed subject matter focuses on
      the synthesis of iron oxide particles as a chemical looping
      sorbent in order to achieve the integration between carbon capture
      and storage technologies. The synthesized iron-based chemical
      looping sorbent has been found to be as effective as commercially
      available iron oxide nanoparticles at converting
      syngas/carbonaceous fuel into high purity H2, while producing a
      sequestration-ready CO2 stream.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] The disclosed subject matter utilizes the iron component of
      magnesium-bearing minerals, e.g., olivine and serpentine, during
      carbon mineral sequestration. These minerals often contain 5-10
      percent by weight of iron, and the recovery and utilization of
      iron during the mineral processing increases the economic
      feasibility of carbon mineral sequestration technology. Among many
      applications of iron-based materials, the disclosed subject matter
      focuses on the synthesis of iron-based chemical looping sorbents,
      which can be used for carbon dioxide capture and hydrogen
      production, as well as the syntheses of iron-based catalysts to be
      used in the production of synthetic liquid fuels and hydrogen from
      carbonaceous materials including coal, biomass, and municipal
      solid wastes...<br>

      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE ART AND SUMMARY OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS OF
        THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0004] The production of gaseous hydrogen, and particularly,
      gaseous hydrogen of high purity, is known in the prior art. A
      variety of feedstocks are known to be useful for these processes,
      including petroleum, coal, biomass, oil sands, coke, tar, wax oil
      shales, or combinations of these materials. Depending upon the
      feedstock selected, the amount of sulfur and halogens present in
      the feedstock can vary extensively, and many considerations,
      including catalyst poisoning and the cost of environmental control
      equipment can be effected by these specific contaminants. [0005]
      Also, the process used will affect the amount of carbon dioxide
      produced. As carbon dioxide is associated with global warming,
      emissions of carbon dioxide must be controlled. [0006] It is
      therefore an unmet advantage of the prior art to provide a process
      of this type wherein the carbon dioxide, sulfur and halides are
      captured as a part of the hydrogen production process.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] The rising energy demand coupled with the depleting global
      oil reserves and the environmental degradation due to emissions
      has led to extensive research in the field of clean energy
      production. The total energy use, globally, has been predicted to
      increase from 421 quadrillion BTU in 2003 to 722 quadrillion BTU
      in 2030. &lt;l&gt; In the United States, the annual energy
      consumption is projected to increase by 71% from 2003 to 2030,
      which is much higher than the predicted increase in the domestic
      energy production. Currently, the United States is dependent on
      foreign oil for 56% of its energy needs. This translates to the
      fact that although the production capacity of petroleum products
      and natural gas will increase, the US will be dependent on foreign
      oil for 70% of its energy needs by 2025. &lt;l&gt; On the other
      front, the energy related CO2 emission has increased at an annual
      average percentage of 1.3 % in the past decade and is projected by
      the EIA to increase at the same rate till 2030. To add to this,
      oil prices are expected to soar up by 50 % at the end of 2030.
      &lt;l&gt; Hence, the implementation of energy generation
      technologies as well as production of "Green" fuels which will
      reduce the dependence on oil, limit the emissions of CO2, sulfur
      and other pollutants and be economically feasible are the need of
      the hour.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] This need has led to a global push towards the development
      of efficient, economical, and reliable carbon capture and
      sequestration technologies (CCS) for application to fossil fuel
      based power plants. Coal is present in abundance, about 494
      billion tons of reserves in the United States, within which the
      state of Ohio has 5% or 24 billion tons of reserves. While it
      gives rise to harmful emissions it can be used to provide a major
      portion of our energy needs if CCS is implemented in a carbon
      constrained scenario. The implementation of CO2 capture could be
      through post combustion capture, oxy-combustion and
      pre-combustion. These technologies could be applied to either
      coal, natural gas or biomass based systems. Figure 1 illustrates
      these concepts through simplified flow diagrams.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] Post combustion capture technology involves the combustion
      of coal or natural gas to produce hot flue gas which is used to
      generate steam. The CO2 from the flue gas is then captured using
      solvents or sorbents. Although coal combustion for power
      generation is economically viable in a non - carbon constrained
      scenario, this will not be true when a CO2 regulation is applied.
      This is because the combustion of coal or natural gas results in
      the production of large volumes of flue gas in which the CO2
      concentration is very low (13-14% for coal combustion and 3-4% for
      natural gas combustion) and hence the capture of CO2 becomes
      inefficient and expensive. Addition of CO2 capture results in
      plant efficiency losses of 8-12 % resulting in a net efficiency of
      35% for a Super Critical Pulverized Coal Combustion (SC-PCC) plant
      on an LHV basis.&lt;2&gt; In oxy-combustion, the fuel is burnt in
      oxygen and recycled flue gas, to produce a concentrated stream
      containing CO2 and H2O which is then dried, compressed and
      transported for sequestration. Although oxy-combustion obviates
      the need for a separate CO2 capture stage, it requires an Air
      Separation Unit (ASU) which is energy intensive and expensive.
      Oxy-combustion also yields in an overall LHV efficiency of 35 %
      for an SC-PCC plant similar to the post combustion capture
      case.&lt;2&gt; Pre combustion capture involves the gasification of
      coal or the reforming of natural gas to produce syngas. The syngas
      is then cleaned and sent to shift reactors (WGSR) to convert the
      carbon monoxide to H2 and CO2 in the presence of steam. The CO2 is
      then captured from the shifted syngas and the H2 is either
      combusted to produce electricity or purified in a Pressure Swing
      Absorber (PSA) and used for the production of chemicals and liquid
      fuels. The overall efficiency of an IGCC plant with CO2 capture is
      38-40% which is higher than that for post combustion and
      oxy-combustion systems.&lt;2&gt;<br>
      <br>
      [0010] Pre-combustion capture technologies are a potential
      solution to efficient and economical CCS implementation as
      gasification results in the production of a lower level of
      criteria pollutants when compared to combustion and the
      application of CCS to gasification systems is more efficient and
      economical when compared to CCS for post combustion systems. It
      has been estimated that with the implementation of CCS using
      solvent based systems, the increase in the COE for an IGCC is 25
      to 40 % while that for PC boilers is 60 to 85%. In a carbon
      constrained scenario, it has been estimated that the cost of a
      super critical PC boiler will be $2140/KWe while that of an IGCC
      will be $1890/KWe. In addition to being more economical and
      efficient, gasification is also very versatile and capable of
      producing H2 and liquid fuels in addition to electricity.&lt;3&gt;<br>
      <br>
      [0011] Applying CO2 capture to coal gasification requires the
      addition of shift reactors, a CO2 separation process and CO2
      compression and drying. In a typical gasification system, coal is
      partially oxidized in the presence of steam and oxygen to produce
      syngas which is then converted to H2, electricity or liquid fuels.
      <br>
      <br>
      [0012] Coal Gasification: CxHy + H2O = xCO + (Vi + I) H2 (1)<br>
      <br>
      [0013] For the implementation of CCS, the CO in syngas needs to be
      converted to H2 and CO2 via the WGS reaction so that a large
      fraction of the carbon content can be captured. <br>
      <br>
      [0014] WGS reaction: CO + H2O = CO2 + H2 (2)<br>
      <br>
      [0015] In the conventional scenario, a series of shift reactors
      with catalysts and excess steam addition is used due to the
      thermodynamic limitation of the WGS reaction. Depending on the
      sulfur tolerance of the catalyst, the WGSR can be conducted as a
      raw syngas (sour) shift or the clean syngas (sweet) shift.
      Commercially the clean WGSR is carried out in two stages: the high
      and low temperature shift reactors using iron oxide and copper
      catalysts respectively. The high temperature shift is conducted to
      convert the bulk of the carbon monoxide to H2 due to the fast
      kinetics. The lower temperature shift reaction is carried out as
      the equilibrium conversion is higher at lower temperatures but the
      gas stream has to be cooled down to 210 C-240 C which makes the
      process, energy inefficient.&lt;4&gt; Further, the commercial iron
      oxide catalyst has a sulfur tolerance of only about 100 ppm and
      the copper catalyst has a lower tolerance to sulfur (&lt;0.1 ppm)
      and chloride impurities. Hence syngas clean up is required
      upstream of the shift reactors to remove sulfur, chloride and
      other impurities and downstream of the shift operation to remove
      CO2. Cleanup is achieved using conventional scrubbing technology
      which is energy intensive due to the cooling and heating
      requirements. The sour gas shift uses a sulfided catalyst which is
      resistant to high sulfur concentrations in the syngas stream and
      operates at a temperature of 250- 500C. By using the raw gas
      shift, sulfur removal and CO2 removal can be conducted down stream
      of the shift reactor in an integrated mode. However the extent of
      CO conversion is lower in the raw gas shift than in the clean gas
      shift. Addition of the CO2 capture step results in a 25 - 40%
      increase in the cost of electricity (COE), 7.2% decrease in the
      efficiency, 2.1% due to CO2 compression and 0.9% due to CO2
      capture.&lt;3&gt;<br>
      <br>
      [0016] Conventional pre-combustion capture in a natural gas based
      plant involves methane reforming which is conducted at
      temperatures greater than 900C and is highly energy
      intensive.&lt;5&gt; <br>
      <br>
      [0017] Steam Methane Reforming (SMR): CH4 + H2O = CO + 3H2 (3)<br>
      <br>
      [0018] The syngas obtained is then shifted similar to the
      operation in the IGCC system and CO2 capture is achieved at low
      temperatures using physical (eg. selexol, rectisol, chilled
      ammonia) or chemical (eg. amine solutions) solvents resulting in a
      large increase in the parasitic energy requirement and related
      cost of energy. Hence there is a need to improve the energy
      efficiency and economics by implementing process intensification
      to reduce the foot print and improve the heat integration within
      the system. [0019] The Calcium Looping Process (CLP) developed at
      the Ohio State University&lt;6&gt;, as illustrated in Figures 2
      and 3, improves the efficiency of the coal/natural gas to H2
      process by integrating various unit operations into a single
      stage. The CLP not only aids in curbing CO2 emissions but also
      improves the efficiency and reduces the CO2 foot print. It
      utilizes a high temperature regenerable CaO sorbent which in
      addition to capturing the CO2, enhances the yield of H2 and
      simultaneously captures sulfur and halide impurities. It also
      enhances the yield of liquid fuels by reforming the lighter
      hydrocarbons and unconverted syngas into hydrogen which is used to
      increase the H2:C0 ratio in the syngas to 2 and for hydrotreating
      the liquid fuel. [0020] Figure 2 depicts the integration of the
      CLP in a coal gasification system. Syngas obtained from coal
      gasification is sent through a particulate capture device to the
      integrated H2 production reactor. When CaO is injected into the
      syngas it reacts with the CO2, H2S, COS and HCl to form a mixture
      containing predominantly CaCO3 and small amounts of calcium
      sulfide and calcium chloride. The insitu removal of CO2 removes
      the equilibrium limitation of the WGS reaction thereby obviating
      the need for a catalyst and excess steam addition. The CaCO3 is
      subsequently calcined to yield a pure CO2 stream for sequestration
      and the CaO is recycled back. In this process, naturally occurring
      limestone which is cheap and abundantly available is used and its
      capture capacity is maintained at 12.5 moles CO2/Kg of CaO over
      multiple cycles which is significantly larger than other solvents
      and sorbents. Thus the CLP integrates several unit operations,
      such as the WGSR, CO2 capture system, sulfur removal and halide
      removal in one process module. Figure 3 shows the integration of
      the CLP in a natural gas reforming process in which the unit
      operations namely, reforming, WGS, CO2 capture and sulfur removal
      are integrated in a single reactor system. Within the H2
      production reactor, the natural gas is reformed with steam in the
      presence of the reforming catalyst and CaO sorbent. The removal of
      CO2 removes the thermodynamic limitation of the WGSR and the
      reforming reaction and results in a high conversion of the methane
      to H2. The H2 production reactor is heat neutral due to the
      exothermic energy from the WGS and carbonation reactions being
      equal to the endothermic reforming reaction heat duty. Hence the
      temperature of operation for the reforming reaction can be reduced
      from over 900C to 650C. The spent sorbent containing CaCO3, CaO
      and CaS is separated from the H2 and regenerated in a calciner to
      produce a sequestration ready CO2 stream. The CaO sorbent is then
      recycled back to the integrated H2 production reactor. [0021] The
      overall objectives of the CLP are to improve process efficiency
      and economics by process intensification, produce H2 for
      electricity generation, chemicals and liquid fuels synthesis with
      integrated carbon and contaminants capture at high temperatures,
      produce a sequestration ready CO2 stream, reduce excess steam
      requirement and obviate the need for a WGS catalyst. Experimental
      investigation in a bench scale facility reveals that high purity
      H2 of 99.7% purity with less that 1 ppm sulfur impurity can be
      produced. Process evaluation using ASPEN Plus(R) software suggests
      that the overall efficiency of the coal to H2 process integrated
      with the CLP is 64% (HHV) which is significantly higher than 57%
      (HHV) achieved by the state-of-the-art H2 from coal process...<br>

      <b>BACKGROUND</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0002] Since the industrial revolution, the amount of CO2 in the
      atmosphere has risen from 280 ppm in 1800 to 370 ppm in 2000,
      mainly due to the consumption of fossil fuels. More than half of
      the energy used in the United States comes from the use of coal,
      and it is mostly used to generate electricity. Unfortunately, CO2
      is one of the greenhouse gases considered to be responsible for
      global warming. Moreover, the increased atmospheric CO2
      concentration will acidify the ocean and will change the chemistry
      of the surface ocean, leading to a potentially detrimental impact
      on the ecosystem. In order to meet the ever- increasing global
      energy demands, while stabilizing the atmospheric CO2 level,
      current carbon emissions should be significantly reduced.<br>
      <br>
      [0003] There have been significant research and development
      activities in the area of carbon capture and storage (CCS),
      including a number of integrated technologies (e.g., chemical
      looping processes) to combine CO2 capture with
      electricity/chemical/fuel production. Chemical looping processes
      involve a sorbent, typically a metal, or more likely a low
      oxidation state metal oxide that can be oxidized in air. The oxide
      is reduced by carbonaceous fuels in a subsequent step. A variation
      of this approach oxidizes the metal not in air but in a chemical
      reaction with steam to produce a pure stream of H2. The chemical
      looping processes also allow the inherent generation of the
      sequestration-ready CO2 stream at higher pressures.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] Once captured, CO2 can be stored via geological
      sequestration, ocean disposal, mineral carbonation, and biological
      fixation. The mineral sequestration scheme is particularly
      attractive, since this process converts CO2 into thermodynamically
      stable carbonates via the reaction of CO2 with widely available
      non-carbonate minerals, such as serpentine and olivine. Therefore,
      the mineral sequestration process eliminates the risk of
      accidental CO2 releases. The reaction underlining mineral
      carbonation mimics natural chemical transformations of CO2, such
      as the weathering of rocks. The main challenges of this storage
      method have been the slow dissolution kinetics and large energy
      requirement associated with the mineral processing.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0005] The previously developed pH swing carbon mineral
      sequestration immobilizes the gaseous CO2 into a thermodynamically
      stable solid, MgCO3, using Mg-bearing minerals such as serpentine.
      This mineral carbonation technology is particularly promising
      since it generates value-added solid products: high surface area
      silica, iron oxide, and magnesium carbonate, while providing a
      safe and permanent storage option for CO2. By carefully
      controlling the pH of the system, these solids products can be
      produced with high purity. The disclosed subject matter focuses on
      the synthesis of iron oxide particles as a chemical looping
      sorbent in order to achieve the integration between carbon capture
      and storage technologies. The synthesized iron-based chemical
      looping sorbent has been found to be as effective as commercially
      available iron oxide nanoparticles at converting
      syngas/carbonaceous fuel into high purity H2, while producing a
      sequestration-ready CO2 stream.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] The disclosed subject matter utilizes the iron component of
      magnesium-bearing minerals, e.g., olivine and serpentine, during
      carbon mineral sequestration. These minerals often contain 5-10
      percent by weight of iron, and the recovery and utilization of
      iron during the mineral processing increases the economic
      feasibility of carbon mineral sequestration technology. Among many
      applications of iron-based materials, the disclosed subject matter
      focuses on the synthesis of iron-based chemical looping sorbents,
      which can be used for carbon dioxide capture and hydrogen
      production, as well as the syntheses of iron-based catalysts to be
      used in the production of synthetic liquid fuels and hydrogen from
      carbonaceous materials including coal, biomass, and municipal
      solid wastes...<br>

      <b>BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0003] The concept of utilizing lime for carbon dioxide capture
      has existed for well over a century. It was first introduced by
      DuMotay and Marechal in 1869 for enhancing the gasification of
      coal using lime followed by CONSOL's CO2 acceptor process a
      century later when this concept was tested in a 40 tons/day plant.
      A variation of this process called the Hypring process was
      developed in Japan for the production of hydrogen at high
      pressures. Harrison et al. and Grace et al. have also applied this
      concept to the production of hydrogen both from Syngas by the
      water gas shift reaction and methane by the sorption enhanced
      steam methane reforming reaction. Silaban et al. studied the
      reversibility of the carbonation reaction for the production of
      hydrogen.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] Within the last decade research has also focused on the use
      of lime for carbon dioxide capture from combustion flue gas.
      Shimizu et al. conceptually designed a process that uses
      twin-fluidized bed reactors for capturing carbon dioxide from a
      coal combustion power plant. After the conceptual design, a
      significant amount of research has advanced the concept greatly.
      The contribution of John R. Grace from the University of British
      Columbia, Juan Carlos Abanades from Instituto Nacional del
      Carbon-CSIC and CANMET energy Technology Centre have further
      enhanced the understanding of the Chemical Looping Technology
      using lime sorbent for the capture of CO2. In addition, the
      reversibility of the carbonation reaction, the investigation of
      the decay of CO2 capture over multiple cycles of carbonation and
      calcination and the production layer formation have been studied
      by Barker et al., Bhatia and Perlmutter and Mess et al.
      respectively.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] The regenerability of the calcium oxide sorbent has been
      the major draw back of high temperature calcium based CO2 capture
      processes. CaO oxide sorbents are prone to sintering during to the
      regeneration step which is conducted at high temperatures. Over
      multiple cycles sintering progressively increases and reduces the
      CO2 capture capacity of the sorbent. Sintering results in an
      increase in solid circulation and make up rate. Research has been
      conducted to develop methods of reducing the sintering of the
      sorbent. Pretreatment methods have been developed at the CANMET
      Energy Center which involves hydration of the calcined sorbent at
      100[deg.] C. at atmospheric pressure and saturation pressure,
      powdering the sorbent and preheating the sorbent in a nitrogen
      atmosphere. The sintering of the sorbent was reduced when these
      pretreatment methods were applied to the sorbent. This concept
      developed by CANMET Energy Center is only a pretreatment method
      and is applied to the sorbent once in 20 cycles and sorbent
      sintering still occurs resulting in a reduction in CO2 capture
      capacity. This concept has been tested by Manovic et al. in TGA,
      fixed bed and a 75 KWth dual fluidized bed combustion plant.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] Grace et al. have also investigated the pretreatment of the
      sorbent by hydration at atmospheric pressure at 150[deg.] C. and
      300[deg.] C. From thermodynamics it is seen that complete
      hydration does not occur spontaneously at temperature of 300[deg.]
      C. and hence complete reactivation of the sorbent is not achieved
      by these methods. In addition, this method has also been developed
      to be applied once in a few cycles and hence sorbent degradation
      still occurs.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] The reactivation of the sorbent by recarbonation has also
      been investigated but this process requires an additional
      calcination step which is very energy consuming and uneconomical.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] Zeeman et al. have integrated the hydration process as a
      reactivation step in the CO2 removal process. They hydrate the
      sorbent at 300[deg.] C. in the presence of CO2 and steam at
      atmospheric pressure. There has been no mention about the extent
      of hydration achieved by this process and the amount of
      carbonation occurring during the hydration process. Although this
      method was found to reduce sintering and reactivate the sorbent a
      steady decline in the reactivity of the sorbent was still
      observed.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] Consequently, it can be understood that there is a need for
      a cost effective and efficient system and method to minimize the
      sintering of the selected sorbent and overcome the sorbents decay
      in reactivity. Exemplary systems and methods of the inventive
      concept satisfy these needs/preferences.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIVE CONCEPT</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0010] Exemplary embodiments of the present invention are directed
      to economically feasible options for the integration of calcium
      sorbent based CO2 capture technology in post-combustion systems,
      specifically in coal-fired power plants. Exemplary embodiments
      described herein may also be applicable for pre-combustion
      systems. Exemplary embodiments of the inventive concept
      specifically provide process integration options while factoring
      in such variables as location(s) of flue/fuel gas drawn for CO2
      capture, source of steam for the hydrator, solids purge and
      recycle locations, particle capture devices (PCDs), reactor
      configurations, heat management, and a variety of other factors.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] In contrast to the above mentioned methods of sorbent
      reactivation. The Ohio State University has developed a process to
      completely reactivate the sorbent in an energy efficient manner
      using pressure hydration. The complete reactivation of the sorbent
      during every cycle reverses the effect of sintering and the
      history of the number of cycles is completely lost. Hence, this
      process minimizes the amount of solids circulation in the system.
      In addition, pressure hydration of the sorbent may be conducted at
      high temperatures of 600[deg.] C. and the exothermic energy of
      hydration is used to supply the endothermic energy of dehydration.
      In addition, pressure hydration does not require the cooling and
      reheating of the sorbent thereby reducing the parasitic energy
      consumption of the process. Extensive experiments have been
      conducted at the Ohio State University wherein complete
      regeneration of the sorbent has been observed for a number of
      cycles. Pressure hydration as used herein does not require
      saturation pressure or high pressure of operation. A pressure of
      above 6 bar is sufficient for a temperature of 600[deg.] C. As the
      temperature decreases the pressure required is also reduced. Thus,
      the hydration process proposed by the Ohio state University is
      energy efficient and economical.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] Embodiments of the present invention detail a process for
      the efficient capture of CO2 and sulfur from combustion flue gas
      streams and gasification based fuel gas mixtures using regenerable
      and recyclable calcium based sorbents. In exemplary embodiments,
      the solid sorbent is predominantly a metal oxide that can be
      converted into a hydrate. Some exemplary embodiments specifically
      provide a method of reactivating the sorbent by hydrating it at a
      high temperature of about 600[deg.] C. and a pressure higher than
      about 6 bars in order to lower the parasitic energy consumption of
      the process. In other exemplary embodiments, hydration occurs at
      temperatures high enough such that heat generated from exothermic
      reaction can be extracted to generate steam for a steam turbine or
      used for heat exchange; minimum of at least 300[deg.] C. and
      greater for steam turbine integration. At higher hydration
      temperatures, greater than about 500[deg.] C., process efficiency
      increases, but hydration must operate at pressures greater than 1
      atm. At temperatures between about 300[deg.] C. to about 500[deg.]
      C. hydration may occur at about 1 atmosphere. More specifically,
      temperature from between 350[deg.] C. and about 512[deg.] C. By
      hydrating the sorbent at high temperatures the energy loss due to
      solids heating and cooling can be avoided and most crucially the
      exothermic energy of hydration can be used to provide the energy
      required for the dehydration of the sorbent or to generate high
      quality steam for additional electricity generation. At high
      temperatures of 600[deg.] C., the hydration reaction proceeds to
      completion only at pressures higher than 6 bars and hence the
      hydration is conducted at high pressures.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] In other exemplary embodiments at different temperatures of
      sorbent hydration, the pressure must also be adjusted to maintain
      maximum reactivity. This reactivation procedure which follows the
      calcination step during every carbonation calcination cycle
      produces a high capacity regenerable sorbent which aids in
      lowering the total amount of solids in circulation making the CO2
      capture process economically attractive...<br>

      High efficiency electricity generation processes and systems with
      substantially zero CO2 emissions are provided. A closed looping
      between the unit that generates gaseous fuel (H2, CO, etc) and the
      fuel cell anode side is formed. In certain embodiments, the heat
      and exhaust oxygen containing gas from the fuel cell cathode side
      are also utilized for the gaseous fuel generation. The systems for
      converting fuel may comprise reactors configured to conduct
      oxidation- reduction reactions. The resulting power generation
      efficiencies are improved due to the minimized steam consumption
      for the gaseous fuel production.in the fuel cell anode loop as
      well as the strategic mass and energy integration schemes.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention is generally directed to systems and methods
      of electricity generation with in-situ CO2 capture. In certain
      embodiments, a reduction- oxidation (redox) system using one or
      more chemical intermediates is utilized to convert carbonaceous
      fuel with C([3/4] capture. This is followed by strategic
      integration with an electrochemical conversion device to produce
      electricity. In other embodiments, water splitting systems are
      integrated with the electrochemical systems. Through the process
      integrations, the process auxiliary power consumption and/or water
      utilization and energy used for steam generation are minimized.<br>
      <br>
      Fossil fuels including crude oil, natural gas, and coal represent
      the majority of today's energy supply worldwide. The use of fossil
      fuels, however, requires that they be transformed to a carrier
      such as heat, electricity, liquid fuels, or chemicals through
      chemical conversion processes. With an increasing energy demand
      and concomitant concerns over the carbon emissions from fossil
      fuel usage, extensive efforts have been geared toward developing
      carbon neutral, efficient and economical energy systems that are
      sustainable. A transition from the use of fossil fuels to that of
      nuclear and renewable resources such as solar and biomass, thus,
      represents the natural progression of such efforts. Existing
      electricity generation technologies have one or more of the
      following limitations/drawbacks: 1) high costs (e.g.,
      photovoltaic, gasification, ultra- supercritical pulverized coal
      combustion); 2) low efficiency (e.g., sub-critical pulverized coal
      combustion); 3) environmental concerns (e.g., fossil fuel power
      plants); and 4) safety concerns (e.g., nuclear power). One of the
      common issues with respect to a conventional thermal power plant
      is the large amount of exergy loss during cooling and reheating of
      steam. A system and method that minimizes the requirements for
      steam generation is thus desirable.<br>
      <br>
      Chemical reactions between carbonaceous fuels and air/steam/C02
      through the assistance of a reaction medium may represent an
      effective way to minimize exergy loss in the fuel conversion
      process. A number of techniques have been proposed to convert
      carbonaceous fuels using metal oxide. For example, Watkins, U.S.
      Patent No. 3,027,238, describes a method for producing hydrogen
      gas including reducing a metal oxide in a reducing zone, and
      oxidizing the reduced metal with steam to produce hydrogen in an
      oxidizing zone. This technique, however, is limited to gaseous
      fuel conversion. Moreover, the gaseous fuel is only partially
      converted by the metal oxide. Thomas, US Patent No. 7,767,191;
      Fan, PCT Application No. WO 2007082089; and Fan, PCT Application
      No. WO 2010037011 describe methods for producing hydrogen gas by
      reducing a metal oxide in a reduction reaction between a
      carbon-based fuel and a metal oxide to provide a reduced metal or
      metal oxide having a lower oxidation state, and oxidizing the
      reduced metal or metal oxide to produce hydrogen and a metal oxide
      having a higher oxidation state.<br>
      <br>
      Hydrogen can also be produced from water splitting through
      photoelectrolysis, thermolysis, and thermochemical routes. To
      produce electricity, the aforementioned processes teach the
      further conversion of the hydrogen product in a gas turbine, gas
      engine, and/or fuel cell. However, a large amount of steam is used
      in these processes for hydrogen generation. Simple conversion of
      hydrogen in conventional hydrogen fueled power generation devices
      will lead to cooling and reheating of large amounts of
      steam/water, resulting in a large irreversibility of the power
      generation system.<br>
      <br>
      With increasing demand for electricity, the need arises for
      improved processes, systems, and system components therein, which
      produce electricity with higher efficiency and fewer pollutants.<br>
      <br>
      Embodiments of the present invention are generally directed to

      utilized for the gaseous fuel generation. The power generation
      efficiencies of the systems disclosed herein are significantly
      greater than state-of-the-art approaches due to the minimized
      steam consumption for the gaseous fuel production, in the fuel

      The present invention is generally directed to systems and methods
      for synthetic fuels and chemical products generation with in-situ
      C02 capture. A reduction- oxidation (redox) system using one or

      with liquid fuel generation via indirect C02 hydrogenation, direct
      hydrogenation, or pyrolysis.<br>
      <br>
      Fossil fuels including crude oil, natural gas, and coal provide
      more than 85% of today's energy supply. These fossil fuels are
      usually transformed to carriers such as electricity and liquid
      transportation fuels prior to utilization by end consumers.
      Electricity is mainly produced by relatively abundant energy
      sources such as coal, natural gas, and nuclear. In contrast,
      liquid transportation fuel is almost exclusively obtained from
      crude oil, whose supply is relatively insecure with volatile
      prices. With an increasing energy demand and concomitant concerns
      over carbon emissions from fossil fuel usage, affordable synthetic
      transportation fuels from more abundant resources such as coal,
      biomass, and oil shale are desirable. To address the environmental
      concerns, the next generation synthetic fuel production processes
      need to be able to capture pollutants generated in the process.
      These pollutants include C02, sulfur compounds, and mercury, among
      others.<br>
      <br>
      Synthetic fuel is generated from gaseous fuels such as natural gas
      through reforming and the Fischer- Tropsch ("F-T") scheme. Solid
      fuels such as coal, biomass, and pet coke can be converted to
      synthetic fuel through indirect liquefaction (gasification - water
      gas shift - Fischer- Tropsch), direct liquefaction, or pyrolysis.
      These systems are, however, more capital intensive than oil
      refining processes. Moreover, their energy conversion efficiencies
      are relatively low. <br>
      <br>
      Synthetic fuel can also be generated from biomass via biochemical
      routes.<br>
      <br>
      However, a large amount of process water is utilized. Moreover,
      the biochemical approaches have stringent requirements on the
      feedstock.<br>
      <br>
      All the aforementioned processes involve C02 emissions. C02
      capture from these processes associates with notable energy losses
      and hence decreases in process efficiency. Embodiments of the
      present invention provide alternatives to produce synthetic fuel

      <b>Technical Background</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      There is a constant need for clean and efficient energy generation
      systems. Most of the commercial processes that generate energy
      carriers such as steam, hydrogen, synthesis gas (syngas), liquid
      fuels and/or electricity are based on fossil fuels. Furthermore,
      the dependence on fossil fuels is expected to continue in the
      foreseeable future due to the much lower costs compared to
      renewable sources. Currently, the conversion of carbonaceous fuels
      such as coal, natural gas, petroleum coke is usually conducted
      through a combustion or reforming process. However, combustion of
      carbonaceous fuels, especially coal, is a carbon intensive process
      that emits large quantities of carbon dioxide to the environment.
      Sulfur and nitrogen compounds are also generated in this process
      due to the complex content in coal.<br>
      <br>
      Chemical reactions between metal oxides and carbonaceous fuels, on
      the other hand, may provide a better way to recover the energy
      stored in the fuels. Several processes are based on the reaction
      of metal oxide particles with carbonaceous fuels to produce useful
      energy carriers. For example, Ishida et al. U.S. Pat. No.
      5,447,024 describes processes wherein nickel oxide particles are
      used to convert natural gas through a chemical looping process
      into heat, which may be used in a turbine. However, recyclability
      of pure metal oxides is poor and constitutes an impediment for its
      use in commercial and industrial processes. Moreover, this
      technology has limited applicability, because it may only convert
      natural gas, which is more costly than other fossil fuels. Another
      well known process is a steam-iron process, wherein coal derived
      producer gas is reacted with iron oxide particles in a fhiidized
      bed reactor to be later regenerated with steam to produce hydrogen
      gas. This process however suffers from poor gas conversion rates
      due to improper contact between reacting solids and gases, and is
      incapable of producing a hydrogen rich stream.<br>
      <br>
      As demands increase for cleaner and more efficient systems of
      converting fuel, the need arises for improved systems, and system
      components therein, which will convert fuel effectively, while
      reducing pollutants.<br>
      <br>
      The concepts of the present disclosure are generally applicable to
      systems for producing hydrogen from coal, or other carbonaceous
      fuels. In accordance with one embodiment of the present
      disclosure, a system for converting fuel may comprise a first
      moving bed reactor, a second reactor, and a non-mechanical valve.
      The first moving bed reactor may comprise at least one tapered
      section and multiple injection gas ports. The multiple injection
      gas ports may be configured to deliver a fuel to the first moving
      bed reactor. The first moving bed reactor may be configured to

      This application claims the benefit of prior-filed U.S.
      Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61/484,982, filed May 11,
      2011, the subject matter of which is hereby incorporated by
      reference in its entirety. The present invention relates to oxygen
      carrying materials, and specifically to oxygen carrying materials
      that are associated with chemical looping systems.<br>
      <br>
      There is a constant need for clean and efficient energy generation
      systems. Most of the commercial processes that generate energy
      carriers such as steam, hydrogen, synthesis gas (syngas), liquid
      fuels and/or electricity are based on fossil fuels. Furthermore,
      the dependence on fossil fuels is expected to continue in the
      foreseeable future due to the lower costs compared to renewable
      sources. Currently, the conversion of carbonaceous fuels such as
      coal, natural gas, and petroleum coke is usually conducted through
      a combustion or reforming process. However, combustion of
      carbonaceous fuels, especially coal, is a carbon intensive process
      that emits large quantities of carbon dioxide to the environment.
      Sulfur and nitrogen compounds are also generated in this process
      due to the complex content in coal.<br>
      <br>
      Traditionally the chemical energy stored inside coal has been
      utilized by combustion with 02, with C02 and H20 as products.
      Similar reactions can be carried out if instead of oxygen, an
      oxygen carrying material is used in a chemical looping process.
      For example, metal oxides such as Fe203 can act as suitable oxygen
      carrying materials. However, unlike combustion of fuel with air,
      there is a relatively pure sequestration ready C02 stream produced
      on combustion with metal oxide carriers. The reduced form of metal
      oxide may then be reacted with air to liberate heat to produce
      electricity or reacted with steam to form a relatively pure stream
      of hydrogen, which can then be used for a variety of purposes.<br>
      <br>
      Chemical reactions between metal oxides and carbonaceous fuels, on
      the other hand, may provide a better way to recover the energy
      stored in the fuels. Several processes are based on the reaction
      of metal oxide particles with carbonaceous fuels to produce useful
      energy carriers. For example, Ishida et al. (U.S. Pat. No.
      5,447,024) describes processes wherein nickel oxide particles are
      used to convert natural gas through a chemical looping process
      into heat, which may be used in a turbine. However, recyclability
      of pure metal oxides is poor and constitutes an impediment for its
      use in commercial and industrial processes. Moreover, this
      technology has limited applicability, because it can only convert
      natural gas, which is more costly than other fossil fuels. Another
      well known process is a steam-iron process, wherein coal derived
      producer gas is reacted with iron oxide particles in a fluidized
      bed reactor to be later regenerated with steam to produce hydrogen
      gas. This process however suffers from poor gas conversion rates
      due to improper contact between reacting solids and gases, and is
      incapable of producing a hydrogen rich stream.<br>
      <br>
      One of the problems with the prior art in combustion looping
      systems has been the metal/metal oxide oxygen carrying material.
      For example, iron in the form of small particles may degrade and
      break up in the reactor. Iron oxide has little mechanical strength
      as well. After only a few redox cycles, the activity and oxygen
      carrying capacity of the metal/metal oxide may decline
      considerably. Replacing the oxygen carrying material with
      additional fresh metal/metal oxide makes the process more costly.<br>
      <br>
      As demands increase for cleaner and more efficient systems of
      converting fuel, the need arises for improved systems, and system
      components therein, which will convert fuel effectively, while
      reducing pollutants.<br>
      <br>
      The concepts of the present disclosure are generally applicable to
      oxygen carrying materials. In accordance with one embodiment of
      the present disclosure, an oxygen carrying material may comprise a
      primary active mass, a primary support material, and a secondary
      support material. The oxygen carrying material may comprise about
      20% to about 70% by weight of the primary active mass, the primary
      active mass comprising a composition having a metal or metal oxide
      selected from the group consisting of Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Mo, Mn, Sn,
      Ru, Rh, and combinations thereof. The oxygen carrying material may
      comprise about 5% to about 70% by weight of a primary support
      material. The primary support material may comprise a composition
      having at least one metal, metal oxide, metal carbide, metal
      nitrate, metal halide, or combinations thereof; at least one
      ceramic or clay material, or salts thereof; at least one naturally
      occurring ore; or combinations thereof. The oxygen carrying
      material may comprise about 1% to about 35% by mass of a secondary
      support material. The secondary support material may comprise a
      composition having at least one metal, metal oxide, metal carbide,
      metal nitrate, metal halide, or combinations thereof; at least one
      ceramic or clay material or salts thereof; at least one naturally
      occurring ore; or combinations thereof. The primary support
      material composition and the secondary support material
      composition may be different. In accordance with another
      embodiment of the present disclosure, a system for converting fuel
      may comprise an oxygen carrying material, a first reactor
      comprising a moving bed and an inlet for providing fuel to the
      first reactor, wherein the first reactor is configured to reduce
      the oxygen carrying material with the fuel to produce a reduced
      oxygen carrying material, and a second reactor communicating with
      the first reactor and an oxygen source, wherein the second reactor
      is configured to regenerate the oxygen carrying material by
      oxidizing the oxygen carrying material.<br>
      <br>
      In accordance with another embodiment of the present disclosure, a
      method for synthesizing an oxygen carrying material may include
      forming a matrix comprising a primary active mass, a primary
      support, and a secondary support; drying the matrix; and forming
      the matrix into particles of the oxygen carrying material...<br>

      <b>BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0003] The concept of utilizing lime for carbon dioxide capture
      has existed for well over a century. It was first introduced by
      DuMotay and Marechal in 1869 for enhancing the gasification of
      coal using lime followed by CONSOL's CO2 acceptor process a
      century later when this concept was tested in a 40 tons/day plant.
      A variation of this process called the Hypring process was
      developed in Japan for the production of hydrogen at high
      pressures. Harrison et al. and Grace et al. have also applied this
      concept to the production of hydrogen both from Syngas by the
      water gas shift reaction and methane by the sorption enhanced
      steam methane reforming reaction. Silaban et al. studied the
      reversibility of the carbonation reaction for the production of
      hydrogen.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] Within the last decade research has also focused on the use
      of lime for carbon dioxide capture from combustion flue gas.
      Shimizu et al. conceptually designed a process that uses
      twin-fluidized bed reactors for capturing carbon dioxide from a
      coal combustion power plant. After the conceptual design, a
      significant amount of research has advanced the concept greatly.
      The contribution of John R. Grace from the University of British
      Columbia, Juan Carlos Abanades from Instituto Nacional del
      Carbon-CSIC and CANMET energy Technology Centre have further
      enhanced the understanding of the Chemical Looping Technology
      using lime sorbent for the capture of CO2. In addition, the
      reversibility of the carbonation reaction, the investigation of
      the decay of CO2 capture over multiple cycles of carbonation and
      calcination and the production layer formation have been studied
      by Barker et al., Bhatia and Perlmutter and Mess et al.
      respectively.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] The regenerability of the calcium oxide sorbent has been
      the major draw back of high temperature calcium based CO2 capture
      processes. CaO oxide sorbents are prone to sintering during to the
      regeneration step which is conducted at high temperatures. Over
      multiple cycles sintering progressively increases and reduces the
      CO2 capture capacity of the sorbent. Sintering results in an
      increase in solid circulation and make up rate. Research has been
      conducted to develop methods of reducing the sintering of the
      sorbent. Pretreatment methods have been developed at the CANMET
      Energy Center which involves hydration of the calcined sorbent at
      100[deg.] C. at atmospheric pressure and saturation pressure,
      powdering the sorbent and preheating the sorbent in a nitrogen
      atmosphere. The sintering of the sorbent was reduced when these
      pretreatment methods were applied to the sorbent. This concept
      developed by CANMET Energy Center is only a pretreatment method
      and is applied to the sorbent once in 20 cycles and sorbent
      sintering still occurs resulting in a reduction in CO2 capture
      capacity. This concept has been tested by Manovic et al. in TGA,
      fixed bed and a 75 KWth dual fluidized bed combustion plant.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] Grace et al. have also investigated the pretreatment of the
      sorbent by hydration at atmospheric pressure at 150[deg.] C. and
      300[deg.] C. From thermodynamics it is seen that complete
      hydration does not occur spontaneously at temperature of 300[deg.]
      C. and hence complete reactivation of the sorbent is not achieved
      by these methods. In addition, this method has also been developed
      to be applied once in a few cycles and hence sorbent degradation
      still occurs.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] The reactivation of the sorbent by recarbonation has also
      been investigated but this process requires an additional
      calcination step which is very energy consuming and uneconomical.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] Zeeman et al. have integrated the hydration process as a
      reactivation step in the CO2 removal process. They hydrate the
      sorbent at 300[deg.] C. in the presence of CO2 and steam at
      atmospheric pressure. There has been no mention about the extent
      of hydration achieved by this process and the amount of
      carbonation occurring during the hydration process. Although this
      method was found to reduce sintering and reactivate the sorbent a
      steady decline in the reactivity of the sorbent was still
      observed.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] Consequently, it can be understood that there is a need for
      a cost effective and efficient system and method to minimize the
      sintering of the selected sorbent and overcome the sorbents decay
      in reactivity. Exemplary systems and methods of the inventive
      concept satisfy these needs/preferences.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIVE CONCEPT</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0010] Exemplary embodiments of the present invention are directed
      to economically feasible options for the integration of calcium
      sorbent based CO2 capture technology in post-combustion systems,
      specifically in coal-fired power plants. Exemplary embodiments
      described herein may also be applicable for pre-combustion
      systems. Exemplary embodiments of the inventive concept
      specifically provide process integration options while factoring
      in such variables as location(s) of flue/fuel gas drawn for CO2
      capture, source of steam for the hydrator, solids purge and
      recycle locations, particle capture devices (PCDs), reactor
      configurations, heat management, and a variety of other factors.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] In contrast to the above mentioned methods of sorbent
      reactivation. The Ohio State University has developed a process to
      completely reactivate the sorbent in an energy efficient manner
      using pressure hydration. The complete reactivation of the sorbent
      during every cycle reverses the effect of sintering and the
      history of the number of cycles is completely lost. Hence, this
      process minimizes the amount of solids circulation in the system.
      In addition, pressure hydration of the sorbent may be conducted at
      high temperatures of 600[deg.] C. and the exothermic energy of
      hydration is used to supply the endothermic energy of dehydration.
      In addition, pressure hydration does not require the cooling and
      reheating of the sorbent thereby reducing the parasitic energy
      consumption of the process. Extensive experiments have been
      conducted at the Ohio State University wherein complete
      regeneration of the sorbent has been observed for a number of
      cycles. Pressure hydration as used herein does not require
      saturation pressure or high pressure of operation. A pressure of
      above 6 bar is sufficient for a temperature of 600[deg.] C. As the
      temperature decreases the pressure required is also reduced. Thus,
      the hydration process proposed by the Ohio state University is
      energy efficient and economical.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] Embodiments of the present invention detail a process for
      the efficient capture of CO2 and sulfur from combustion flue gas
      streams and gasification based fuel gas mixtures using regenerable
      and recyclable calcium based sorbents. In exemplary embodiments,
      the solid sorbent is predominantly a metal oxide that can be
      converted into a hydrate. Some exemplary embodiments specifically
      provide a method of reactivating the sorbent by hydrating it at a
      high temperature of about 600[deg.] C. and a pressure higher than
      about 6 bars in order to lower the parasitic energy consumption of
      the process. In other exemplary embodiments, hydration occurs at
      temperatures high enough such that heat generated from exothermic
      reaction can be extracted to generate steam for a steam turbine or
      used for heat exchange; minimum of at least 300[deg.] C. and
      greater for steam turbine integration. At higher hydration
      temperatures, greater than about 500[deg.] C., process efficiency
      increases, but hydration must operate at pressures greater than 1
      atm. At temperatures between about 300[deg.] C. to about 500[deg.]
      C. hydration may occur at about 1 atmosphere. More specifically,
      temperature from between 350[deg.] C. and about 512[deg.] C. By
      hydrating the sorbent at high temperatures the energy loss due to
      solids heating and cooling can be avoided and most crucially the
      exothermic energy of hydration can be used to provide the energy
      required for the dehydration of the sorbent or to generate high
      quality steam for additional electricity generation. At high
      temperatures of 600[deg.] C., the hydration reaction proceeds to
      completion only at pressures higher than 6 bars and hence the
      hydration is conducted at high pressures.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] In other exemplary embodiments at different temperatures of
      sorbent hydration, the pressure must also be adjusted to maintain
      maximum reactivity. This reactivation procedure which follows the
      calcination step during every carbonation calcination cycle
      produces a high capacity regenerable sorbent which aids in
      lowering the total amount of solids in circulation making the CO2
      capture process economically attractive...<br>

      High efficiency electricity generation processes and systems with
      substantially zero CO2 emissions are provided. A closed looping
      between the unit that generates gaseous fuel (H2, CO, etc) and the
      fuel cell anode side is formed. In certain embodiments, the heat
      and exhaust oxygen containing gas from the fuel cell cathode side
      are also utilized for the gaseous fuel generation. The systems for
      converting fuel may comprise reactors configured to conduct
      oxidation- reduction reactions. The resulting power generation
      efficiencies are improved due to the minimized steam consumption
      for the gaseous fuel production.in the fuel cell anode loop as
      well as the strategic mass and energy integration schemes.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention is generally directed to systems and methods
      of electricity generation with in-situ CO2 capture. In certain
      embodiments, a reduction- oxidation (redox) system using one or
      more chemical intermediates is utilized to convert carbonaceous
      fuel with C([3/4] capture. This is followed by strategic
      integration with an electrochemical conversion device to produce
      electricity. In other embodiments, water splitting systems are
      integrated with the electrochemical systems. Through the process
      integrations, the process auxiliary power consumption and/or water
      utilization and energy used for steam generation are minimized.<br>
      <br>
      Fossil fuels including crude oil, natural gas, and coal represent
      the majority of today's energy supply worldwide. The use of fossil
      fuels, however, requires that they be transformed to a carrier
      such as heat, electricity, liquid fuels, or chemicals through
      chemical conversion processes. With an increasing energy demand
      and concomitant concerns over the carbon emissions from fossil
      fuel usage, extensive efforts have been geared toward developing
      carbon neutral, efficient and economical energy systems that are
      sustainable. A transition from the use of fossil fuels to that of
      nuclear and renewable resources such as solar and biomass, thus,
      represents the natural progression of such efforts. Existing
      electricity generation technologies have one or more of the
      following limitations/drawbacks: 1) high costs (e.g.,
      photovoltaic, gasification, ultra- supercritical pulverized coal
      combustion); 2) low efficiency (e.g., sub-critical pulverized coal
      combustion); 3) environmental concerns (e.g., fossil fuel power
      plants); and 4) safety concerns (e.g., nuclear power). One of the
      common issues with respect to a conventional thermal power plant
      is the large amount of exergy loss during cooling and reheating of
      steam. A system and method that minimizes the requirements for
      steam generation is thus desirable.<br>
      <br>
      Chemical reactions between carbonaceous fuels and air/steam/C02
      through the assistance of a reaction medium may represent an
      effective way to minimize exergy loss in the fuel conversion
      process. A number of techniques have been proposed to convert
      carbonaceous fuels using metal oxide. For example, Watkins, U.S.
      Patent No. 3,027,238, describes a method for producing hydrogen
      gas including reducing a metal oxide in a reducing zone, and
      oxidizing the reduced metal with steam to produce hydrogen in an
      oxidizing zone. This technique, however, is limited to gaseous
      fuel conversion. Moreover, the gaseous fuel is only partially
      converted by the metal oxide. Thomas, US Patent No. 7,767,191;
      Fan, PCT Application No. WO 2007082089; and Fan, PCT Application
      No. WO 2010037011 describe methods for producing hydrogen gas by
      reducing a metal oxide in a reduction reaction between a
      carbon-based fuel and a metal oxide to provide a reduced metal or
      metal oxide having a lower oxidation state, and oxidizing the
      reduced metal or metal oxide to produce hydrogen and a metal oxide
      having a higher oxidation state.<br>
      <br>
      Hydrogen can also be produced from water splitting through
      photoelectrolysis, thermolysis, and thermochemical routes. To
      produce electricity, the aforementioned processes teach the
      further conversion of the hydrogen product in a gas turbine, gas
      engine, and/or fuel cell. However, a large amount of steam is used
      in these processes for hydrogen generation. Simple conversion of
      hydrogen in conventional hydrogen fueled power generation devices
      will lead to cooling and reheating of large amounts of
      steam/water, resulting in a large irreversibility of the power
      generation system.<br>
      <br>
      With increasing demand for electricity, the need arises for
      improved processes, systems, and system components therein, which
      produce electricity with higher efficiency and fewer pollutants.<br>
      <br>
      Embodiments of the present invention are generally directed to

      substantially zero CO2 emissions. A closed loop between the unit
      that generates gaseous fuel (H2, CO, etc.) and the fuel cell anode
      side is formed. In certain embodiments, the heat and exhaust
      oxygen containing gas from the fuel cell cathode side are also
      utilized for the gaseous fuel generation. The power generation
      efficiencies of the systems disclosed herein are significantly
      greater than state-of-the-art approaches due to the minimized
      steam consumption for the gaseous fuel production, in the fuel
      cell anode loop, as well as the strategic mass and energy

      more chemical intermediates is generally utilized in conjunction
      with liquid fuel generation via indirect C02 hydrogenation, direct
      hydrogenation, or pyrolysis.<br>
      <br>
      Fossil fuels including crude oil, natural gas, and coal provide
      more than 85% of today's energy supply. These fossil fuels are
      usually transformed to carriers such as electricity and liquid
      transportation fuels prior to utilization by end consumers.
      Electricity is mainly produced by relatively abundant energy
      sources such as coal, natural gas, and nuclear. In contrast,
      liquid transportation fuel is almost exclusively obtained from
      crude oil, whose supply is relatively insecure with volatile
      prices. With an increasing energy demand and concomitant concerns
      over carbon emissions from fossil fuel usage, affordable synthetic
      transportation fuels from more abundant resources such as coal,
      biomass, and oil shale are desirable. To address the environmental
      concerns, the next generation synthetic fuel production processes
      need to be able to capture pollutants generated in the process.
      These pollutants include C02, sulfur compounds, and mercury, among
      others.<br>
      <br>
      Synthetic fuel is generated from gaseous fuels such as natural gas
      through reforming and the Fischer- Tropsch ("F-T") scheme. Solid
      fuels such as coal, biomass, and pet coke can be converted to
      synthetic fuel through indirect liquefaction (gasification - water
      gas shift - Fischer- Tropsch), direct liquefaction, or pyrolysis.
      These systems are, however, more capital intensive than oil
      refining processes. Moreover, their energy conversion efficiencies
      are relatively low. <br>
      <br>
      Synthetic fuel can also be generated from biomass via biochemical
      routes.<br>
      <br>
      However, a large amount of process water is utilized. Moreover,
      the biochemical approaches have stringent requirements on the
      feedstock.<br>
      <br>
      All the aforementioned processes involve C02 emissions. C02
      capture from these processes associates with notable energy losses
      and hence decreases in process efficiency. Embodiments of the
      present invention provide alternatives to produce synthetic fuel
      from naturally occurring carbonaceous fuel sources with high
      efficiency and effective C02 capture.<br>
      <br>
      Embodiments of the present invention are generally directed to
      novel redox based systems for fuel and chemical production with
      in-situ C02 capture. A redox system using one or more chemical
      intermediates is generally utilized in conjunction with liquid
      fuel generation via indirect Fischer- Tropsch synthesis, direct
      hydrogenation, or pyrolysis. The redox system is used to generate
      a hydrogen rich stream and/or C02 and/or heat for liquid fuel and
      chemical production. A portion of the byproduct fuels and/or steam
      from liquid fuel and chemical synthesis is used as part of the
      feedstock for the redox system...<br>

      <b>Technical Background</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      There is a constant need for clean and efficient energy generation
      systems. Most of the commercial processes that generate energy
      carriers such as steam, hydrogen, synthesis gas (syngas), liquid
      fuels and/or electricity are based on fossil fuels. Furthermore,
      the dependence on fossil fuels is expected to continue in the
      foreseeable future due to the much lower costs compared to
      renewable sources. Currently, the conversion of carbonaceous fuels
      such as coal, natural gas, petroleum coke is usually conducted
      through a combustion or reforming process. However, combustion of
      carbonaceous fuels, especially coal, is a carbon intensive process
      that emits large quantities of carbon dioxide to the environment.
      Sulfur and nitrogen compounds are also generated in this process
      due to the complex content in coal.<br>
      <br>
      Chemical reactions between metal oxides and carbonaceous fuels, on
      the other hand, may provide a better way to recover the energy
      stored in the fuels. Several processes are based on the reaction
      of metal oxide particles with carbonaceous fuels to produce useful
      energy carriers. For example, Ishida et al. U.S. Pat. No.
      5,447,024 describes processes wherein nickel oxide particles are
      used to convert natural gas through a chemical looping process
      into heat, which may be used in a turbine. However, recyclability
      of pure metal oxides is poor and constitutes an impediment for its
      use in commercial and industrial processes. Moreover, this
      technology has limited applicability, because it may only convert
      natural gas, which is more costly than other fossil fuels. Another
      well known process is a steam-iron process, wherein coal derived
      producer gas is reacted with iron oxide particles in a fhiidized
      bed reactor to be later regenerated with steam to produce hydrogen
      gas. This process however suffers from poor gas conversion rates
      due to improper contact between reacting solids and gases, and is
      incapable of producing a hydrogen rich stream.<br>
      <br>
      As demands increase for cleaner and more efficient systems of
      converting fuel, the need arises for improved systems, and system
      components therein, which will convert fuel effectively, while
      reducing pollutants.<br>
      <br>
      The concepts of the present disclosure are generally applicable to
      systems for producing hydrogen from coal, or other carbonaceous
      fuels. In accordance with one embodiment of the present
      disclosure, a system for converting fuel may comprise a first
      moving bed reactor, a second reactor, and a non-mechanical valve.
      The first moving bed reactor may comprise at least one tapered
      section and multiple injection gas ports. The multiple injection
      gas ports may be configured to deliver a fuel to the first moving
      bed reactor. The first moving bed reactor may be configured to
      reduce an oxygen carrying material with a fuel by defining a
      countercurrent flowpath for the fuel relative to the oxygen
      carrying material. The second reactor may communicate with the
      first moving bed reactor and may be operable to receive an oxygen
      source. The second reactor may be configured to regenerate the
      reduced oxygen carrying material by oxidation. The non-mechanical
      valve may comprise a circuitous piping assembly disposed between
      the first moving bed reactor and the second reactor. At least one
      gas opening may be configured to receive a gas stream. The gas
      stream may be operable to reduce gas leakage between the first
      moving bed reactor and the second reactor...<br>

      <b>BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0003] The concept of utilizing lime for carbon dioxide capture
      has existed for well over a century. It was first introduced by
      DuMotay and Marechal in 1869 for enhancing the gasification of
      coal using lime followed by CONSOL's CO2 acceptor process a
      century later when this concept was tested in a 40 tons/day plant.
      A variation of this process called the Hypring process was
      developed in Japan for the production of hydrogen at high
      pressures. Harrison et al. and Grace et al. have also applied this
      concept to the production of hydrogen both from Syngas by the
      water gas shift reaction and methane by the sorption enhanced
      steam methane reforming reaction. Silaban et al. studied the
      reversibility of the carbonation reaction for the production of
      hydrogen.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] Within the last decade research has also focused on the use
      of lime for carbon dioxide capture from combustion flue gas.
      Shimizu et al. conceptually designed a process that uses
      twin-fluidized bed reactors for capturing carbon dioxide from a
      coal combustion power plant. After the conceptual design, a
      significant amount of research has advanced the concept greatly.
      The contribution of John R. Grace from the University of British
      Columbia, Juan Carlos Abanades from Instituto Nacional del
      Carbon-CSIC and CANMET energy Technology Centre have further
      enhanced the understanding of the Chemical Looping Technology
      using lime sorbent for the capture of CO2. In addition, the
      reversibility of the carbonation reaction, the investigation of
      the decay of CO2 capture over multiple cycles of carbonation and
      calcination and the production layer formation have been studied
      by Barker et al., Bhatia and Perlmutter and Mess et al.
      respectively.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] The regenerability of the calcium oxide sorbent has been
      the major draw back of high temperature calcium based CO2 capture
      processes. CaO oxide sorbents are prone to sintering during to the
      regeneration step which is conducted at high temperatures. Over
      multiple cycles sintering progressively increases and reduces the
      CO2 capture capacity of the sorbent. Sintering results in an
      increase in solid circulation and make up rate. Research has been
      conducted to develop methods of reducing the sintering of the
      sorbent. Pretreatment methods have been developed at the CANMET
      Energy Center which involves hydration of the calcined sorbent at
      100[deg.] C. at atmospheric pressure and saturation pressure,
      powdering the sorbent and preheating the sorbent in a nitrogen
      atmosphere. The sintering of the sorbent was reduced when these
      pretreatment methods were applied to the sorbent. This concept
      developed by CANMET Energy Center is only a pretreatment method
      and is applied to the sorbent once in 20 cycles and sorbent
      sintering still occurs resulting in a reduction in CO2 capture
      capacity. This concept has been tested by Manovic et al. in TGA,
      fixed bed and a 75 KWth dual fluidized bed combustion plant.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] Grace et al. have also investigated the pretreatment of the
      sorbent by hydration at atmospheric pressure at 150[deg.] C. and
      300[deg.] C. From thermodynamics it is seen that complete
      hydration does not occur spontaneously at temperature of 300[deg.]
      C. and hence complete reactivation of the sorbent is not achieved
      by these methods. In addition, this method has also been developed
      to be applied once in a few cycles and hence sorbent degradation
      still occurs.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] The reactivation of the sorbent by recarbonation has also
      been investigated but this process requires an additional
      calcination step which is very energy consuming and uneconomical.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] Zeeman et al. have integrated the hydration process as a
      reactivation step in the CO2 removal process. They hydrate the
      sorbent at 300[deg.] C. in the presence of CO2 and steam at
      atmospheric pressure. There has been no mention about the extent
      of hydration achieved by this process and the amount of
      carbonation occurring during the hydration process. Although this
      method was found to reduce sintering and reactivate the sorbent a
      steady decline in the reactivity of the sorbent was still
      observed.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] Consequently, it can be understood that there is a need for
      a cost effective and efficient system and method to minimize the
      sintering of the selected sorbent and overcome the sorbents decay
      in reactivity. Exemplary systems and methods of the inventive
      concept satisfy these needs/preferences.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIVE CONCEPT</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0010] Exemplary embodiments of the present invention are directed
      to economically feasible options for the integration of calcium
      sorbent based CO2 capture technology in post-combustion systems,
      specifically in coal-fired power plants. Exemplary embodiments
      described herein may also be applicable for pre-combustion
      systems. Exemplary embodiments of the inventive concept
      specifically provide process integration options while factoring
      in such variables as location(s) of flue/fuel gas drawn for CO2
      capture, source of steam for the hydrator, solids purge and
      recycle locations, particle capture devices (PCDs), reactor
      configurations, heat management, and a variety of other factors.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] In contrast to the above mentioned methods of sorbent
      reactivation. The Ohio State University has developed a process to
      completely reactivate the sorbent in an energy efficient manner
      using pressure hydration. The complete reactivation of the sorbent
      during every cycle reverses the effect of sintering and the
      history of the number of cycles is completely lost. Hence, this
      process minimizes the amount of solids circulation in the system.
      In addition, pressure hydration of the sorbent may be conducted at
      high temperatures of 600[deg.] C. and the exothermic energy of
      hydration is used to supply the endothermic energy of dehydration.
      In addition, pressure hydration does not require the cooling and
      reheating of the sorbent thereby reducing the parasitic energy
      consumption of the process. Extensive experiments have been
      conducted at the Ohio State University wherein complete
      regeneration of the sorbent has been observed for a number of
      cycles. Pressure hydration as used herein does not require
      saturation pressure or high pressure of operation. A pressure of
      above 6 bar is sufficient for a temperature of 600[deg.] C. As the
      temperature decreases the pressure required is also reduced. Thus,
      the hydration process proposed by the Ohio state University is
      energy efficient and economical.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] Embodiments of the present invention detail a process for
      the efficient capture of CO2 and sulfur from combustion flue gas
      streams and gasification based fuel gas mixtures using regenerable
      and recyclable calcium based sorbents. In exemplary embodiments,
      the solid sorbent is predominantly a metal oxide that can be
      converted into a hydrate. Some exemplary embodiments specifically
      provide a method of reactivating the sorbent by hydrating it at a
      high temperature of about 600[deg.] C. and a pressure higher than
      about 6 bars in order to lower the parasitic energy consumption of
      the process. In other exemplary embodiments, hydration occurs at
      temperatures high enough such that heat generated from exothermic
      reaction can be extracted to generate steam for a steam turbine or
      used for heat exchange; minimum of at least 300[deg.] C. and
      greater for steam turbine integration. At higher hydration
      temperatures, greater than about 500[deg.] C., process efficiency
      increases, but hydration must operate at pressures greater than 1
      atm. At temperatures between about 300[deg.] C. to about 500[deg.]
      C. hydration may occur at about 1 atmosphere. More specifically,
      temperature from between 350[deg.] C. and about 512[deg.] C. By
      hydrating the sorbent at high temperatures the energy loss due to
      solids heating and cooling can be avoided and most crucially the
      exothermic energy of hydration can be used to provide the energy
      required for the dehydration of the sorbent or to generate high
      quality steam for additional electricity generation. At high
      temperatures of 600[deg.] C., the hydration reaction proceeds to
      completion only at pressures higher than 6 bars and hence the
      hydration is conducted at high pressures.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] In other exemplary embodiments at different temperatures of
      sorbent hydration, the pressure must also be adjusted to maintain
      maximum reactivity. This reactivation procedure which follows the
      calcination step during every carbonation calcination cycle
      produces a high capacity regenerable sorbent which aids in
      lowering the total amount of solids in circulation making the CO2
      capture process economically attractive...<br>
