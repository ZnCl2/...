      <p>The Capacity Changer, in all its simplicity, is a
        pulse-converter of the Coulomb charge upon one plate of a
        two-terminal capacitor, which becomes a capacitor having only
        one terminal when the plasma stream inside of a glass tube
        (commercially available ultraviolet lights) extinguishes. The
        plasma serves as the disappearing capacitor terminal of the
        Capacity Changer device. </p>

        Tue, 29 Jun 1999 </p>
      <p>Hi Folks! </p>
      <p>Comes here an interesting email regarding a 'one terminal
        capacitor' which you should be aware of thanks to the inventor
        Joseph Hiddink. This is the email he sent me along with my
        response and initial&nbsp; questions. Do check it out if you are
        so inclined; </p>
      <p>Ajax, Ontario, Canada June 29. 1999 </p>
      <p>In 1933, Hitler ordered his Engineers to build a Flying Disk,
        that could come off the ground, without any sound, could fly at
        great speed, without any sound, and it had to be invulnerable.
        His engineers had read about Vandegraaff's ideas. </p>
      <p>The Vandegraaff is a monopole high voltage generator, to a
        degree. Vandegraaff thought, that if he put his sphere to
        ground,and charged it up to five million volts positive, the
        sphere would be positive, the ground would be positive, and plus
        repels plus, ergo: Liftoff. </p>
      <p>So he was invited to come to Germany to do it. But when the
        sphere was on the ground, it only went to 3000 volts, and that
        did not do a thing. So in 1937 they switched to magnetics. And
        yes, by 1941, the day before Hitler invaded Germany, they had
        reached a weight reduction of their Flying Machine of 120
        pounds. </p>
      <p>Trouble was, the machine, which even looked like a Flying
        Saucer weighed two tons. So Hitler scrapped it and went in with
        the rockets. </p>
      <p>Seeing a picture of a Flying Saucer in 1967, and noticing these
        spheres underneath, I asked myself where we use a sphere in the
        physics literature. </p>
      <p>And yes, it was written in the physics books since the 1800's
        as a problem. Probably thought up by Faraday himself. I got it
        as a problem on my final exam Physics in Holland. : </p>
      <p>Two metal concentric spheres form a capacitor C. </p>
      <p>This is charged up to a potential V. </p>
      <p>Then the outside sphere is removed. </p>
      <p>The remaining sphere is a 1-terminal capacitor with a capacity
        c. </p>
      <p>The potential on this sphere is C/c x V. If C+ 1 microfarad,
        and c = 50 micromicrofarad, and V = 1000 volts, we get a
        momentarily pulse of 20 million volts. </p>
      <p>And that is positive all alone, or negative all alone. Of
        course that is difficult to do with these spheres, so the books
        caution that it was "Just a theoretical problem". </p>
      <p>But what if we can make a 2-terminal capacitor that can be
        charged up, and then can be changed into a 1-terminal capacitor?
        That is what I invented 30 seconds after thinking about it.. </p>
      <p>This type of capacitor is inside every sphere, with the
        1-terminal part connected to the sphere. As no charge can exist
        inside the sphere, it flows to the outside. </p>
      <p>If a sphere sits on the ground, and gives such a pulse, the
        first pulse may not do much, but the succeeding ones do. Earth
        will repel that sphere. And once off the ground, the electrical
        field off the sphere (with succeeding pulses) "sees" the earth's
        magnetic field as "ground" and tries to get away from it. </p>
      <p>And that is how it works. The saucer shape is nothing but a
        reflector. Steering is accomplished by applying the proper
        amount of power to each sphere with a joy stick. A sixteen year
        old girl with heavy glasses and normal IQ could fly it. </p>
      <p>Offered to Canada as a birthday present in 1967, it was
        ridiculed by the NRC (Canada), as nobody ever could invent such
        a capacitor, and as thus it was rejected. Confronted many years
        later with the patent, they had to lamely admit, that it could
        be done after all, but the NRC (Canada) was &amp;quotSure that
        it could not work, no funding!&amp;quot. </p>
      <p>After which the President of that institution retired
        immediately But not before exhorting his successor to keep this
        invention in the ridicule section. His successor became head of
        the Canadian Space Agency. If you apply for a patent, you need
        the signature of two witnessse, who declare that they understand
        the invention. </p>
      <p>One of the witnesses required, was a German, now Canadian
        Engineer, who had worked on Hitler's Flying Disk. &amp;quotMy
        God, why did nobody think about that before...? Why did I not
        think about that before...?" </p>
      <p>And he told me about Hitler's Flying Machine that never worked.
        &amp;quotWhen the project was terminated, we were sworn to
        secrecy about it, but that is nonsense now, you found it. .. Why
        did I not think about it before...?" He happens to be the
        world's foremost expert on the parts to make this capacitor. </p>
      <p>Offered to Nasa, the Rocket Experts at the Propulsion Lab,
        where I was referred to, were &amp;quotNot interested, thank
        you.!" You can figure out why. </p>
      <p>We can fly to the Moon in three hours, if need be,
        uncomfortable. Or in comfort, using a constant 1.1 g
        acceleration in two days. Mars in a few weeks. No osteoporosis
        and no barfbags. The Space station and all that nonsense is
        obsolete. </p>
      <p>Of course, anyone who can find out how a Flying Saucer works
        must be an idiot. that is, what I was told at the different
        &amp;quotScientific" Institutes in Canada. </p>
      <p>Invention was evaluated by Hermann... (forgot his last name) of
        the Hudson Institute for Strategical Studies at $600 Billion.
        Now probably Trillion. </p>
      <p>Found 1200 applications, from &amp;quotStarwar" cars that
        float, electrical engines that need only a battery to start,
        airplanes that reach any place on earth in two hours, all VTOL,
        no airports needed, to inexpensive power generators, weather
        control, tornadoes, hurricanes, earthquakes etc... Oil as an
        energy source will be out. No pollution and no noise. </p>
      <p>Just new to the net I will probably get my own site and start
        to advertise some applications. I have to make some money too. I
        wondered of course why the Patent Office never figured that this
        invention should be &amp;quotclassified", but you never argue
        with the dumbells that look after your security. Your security
        Council was informed before too. </p>
      <p>Threaten the President of the US, and CIA and FBI will be at
        your doorstep in five minutes. If all of the US could be in
        danger, if this invention is used by another party, who cares...
        Do have a nice day. </p>

      <p>Dear Jerry: </p>
      <p>I read in one of the missives, that some people are a little
        bit confused about plusses and minuses of voltages. I will try
        to explain once again: </p>
      <p>Draw a circle on a piece of paper. This represents the sphere.
      </p>
      <p>Now draw a capacitor inside that circle (A capacitor is drawn,
        electrically, by two parallel lines that do not touch. Make one
        of the lines solid, and draw a connection to the circle
        (sphere). </p>
      <p>Draw the other line in stipples like - - - - - -, with swiches
        on both sides of the stipples / - - - - - - \ . </p>
      <p>They are in the 'on' position, and that side of the capacitor
        is active. </p>
      <p>Now connect a battery with the minus to the solid line , via a
        switch. / -- </p>
      <p>Connect the plus of the battery to the stipple line part of the
        capacitor, via a switch / , When both switches are thrown, the
        capacitor C ( which will have a size of e.g. 1 microfarad) will
        reach your battery voltage </p>
      <p>Q =3D CV </p>
      <p>Now we put both switches that are connected to the battery in
        the 'off' position. That capacitor is still charged, and the
        sphere would show 12 volt negative. Now the switches connected
        to the stipples are put in the 'off' position. That makes that
        side of the capacitor disappear, the solid line is left, and
        still connected to the sphere, as a 1-terminal capacitor. </p>
      <p>But the capacity is now the capacity of the sphere. And that
        sphere, if it is a little bit bigger than three feet in
        diameter, has a capacity of about 50 micromicrofarad., </p>
      <p>That is 1,000,000 / 50 =3D 20,000 times smaller. But the
        voltage goes up 20,000 times. You get momentarily 240,000 volts.
        and that is negative in nature, like the solid line of your
        capacitor. And it carries the whole charge of the 2-terminal
        capacitor. This part is connected to the sphere. </p>
      <p>If that sphere rests on the ground, the ground will try to
        absorb that voltage. But we, very cunningly, repeat the process,
        fast. And the ground gets another mouthful. But after a few
        mouthfuls, that part of Mother Earth gets fed up, and rejects
        the next appetizer. </p>
      <p>The sphere comes off the ground. Sure, the ground will then
        become obstinate and eventually become positive right under the
        hovering sphere, which would attract the negative sphere, and as
        positive attracts negative, crash it, accompanied by a
        short-distance lightning stroke, but the idea is to get away
        from it all, and after 'rejection' use the earth's magnetic
        field to take off to higher realms. </p>
      <p>There will be a few guidelines for future Flying Saucer
        operators, probably on a computer screen. </p>
      <p>Regards, Joe Hiddink </p>

      <p>Joseph Hiddink </p>
      <p>A Flying Saucer does not have silicon type spheres underneath,
        but metal ones. They are 1-terminal capacitors.&nbsp; Inside
        each sphere is a capacitor, that can be changed from a
        2-terminal capacitor into a 1-terminal capacitor. When in the
        2-terminal capacitor state, it is charged up to about 20,000
        volts or less. </p>
      <p>Then it is changed into a 1-terminal capacitor, with the
        1-terminal connected to the metal sphere on the inside. The
        1-terminal capacitor becomes now the capacity of the metal
        sphere. It is based on a practical application of a problem,
        devised by Faraday, written up in the physics books as
        impossible to do in practice. The problem, if you went to High
        School: Two concnetric metal spheres do not touch and form a
        capacitor C. This one is charged up to a potential V. Then the
        outside sphere is removed. The remaining sphere is a 1-terminal
        capacitor c. The potential on this sphere is momentarily:
        C/c&nbsp; x&nbsp; V. </p>
      <p>Difficult, if not possible to do with spheres, which is the
        reason that the invention was ridiculed and the inventor
        insulted up to four months after the patent was granted. </p>
      <p>Let me quote from the patent: </p>
      <p>If C = 1/10 Microfarad&nbsp; (which is possible with the
        design) and is charged up to a potential of 10,000 volts, the
        charge is 1/10 Coulomb. When this capacitor gets changed into
        the 1-terminal capacitor ( a sphere of about 2 meters, with a
        capacity of about 100 pF ), the resulting electrical pulse is
        about 100 million volts. </p>
      <p>Now, a Flying Saucer does not have to go this potential to get
        lift-off, propulsion and at the same time take power out of the
        air, unless they would like to destroy a town like Sodoma or
        Gomorrah. These "Angels" were human, who came in a Flying
        Saucer. </p>
      <p>Tesla had an electric car, with an 80 HP electric motor, an
        antenna and some electronics. He drove it all the way from New
        York to Buffalo and back at speeds of up to 90 MPH. No gas. Just
        like a Flying Saucer, he took power right out of the air. </p>
      <p>He refused to tell anyone how it worked, as he realized, that
        the system could also be used to give every home on earth free
        electric power. He had designed the Niagara Falls Power Plant
        for Westinghouse and the investors (Rockefeller and Morgan)
        would have killed him. </p>
      <p>He did not patent it, but I did. My poor wife, reading all the
        letters of insult and ridicule, was very upset about it and did
        not want me to work on it, or she would have left me. She died
        recently amd now I am starting to work on it, slowly, as money
        is in short supply. Initial experiment in 1967, zapped all the
        HiFi's and TV's in the neighborhood (I fixed them all for free,
        but did not experiment at home anymore, as it also blew after a
        few seconds a big Power Transformer on a pole 100 yards away,
        luckily a Squirrel was blamed). </p>
      <p>Next experiment in the "sticks" had me lightning coming out of
        the clear blue sky, when I connected the device with a dog-screw
        to ground, and generated three pulses of 500,000 volts. Offered
        to Nasa's Propulsion Lab in Cleveland, it was soldidly rejected
        by the engineers. "Thank you for sending us a copy of your
        patent!" Who needs a propulsion engineer, if we, when using this
        system can be on the Moon in a few hours or at Mars in a day or
        so, no matter where they are located at the time, and all that
        without barf-bags, heat-tiles, or ostoporosis? I believe that
        they tried it a few years ago and caused the big blackout in the
        USA and Canada, blaming a poor, innocent tree. </p>
      <p>They did not know about what precautions to take. Any other
        experiment that you are working on is just a novelty without any
        real desirable results. </p>

      <p>Gravity control is so simple, that I (who told the family at
        age six that I was going to invent that) told my mother on my
        thelfth birthday, that it was going to be so simple, that a high
        school student could have invented it. Guess what. The
        technology was described by Faraday in the 1850's. As a
        theoretical problem. Unfortunately the learned(?) professors in
        the years succeeding wrote in the physics books that it only
        could be done in theory, never in practice. The material to do
        it existed already in the days of Faraday. I got the problem on
        my final exam Physics in my (Dutch) High school. Two concentric
        metal spheres do not touch and form a capacitor C. This one is
        charged up to a potential V. Then the outside sphere is removed.
        The remaining sphere is a one-terminal capacitor c. The
        potential on this sphere is C/c x V. If C = 1 microfarad, and V=
        10,000 volts and c = 50 micro-microfarad, we get a potential of
        20 million volts. And that is positive all alone, or negative,
        all alone. Difficult to do with concentric spheres, so I
        invented a capacitor that can be changed from a one- terminal
        type to a two-terminal type, gets charged up to 10,000 volts,
        after which it reverts to a one-terminal type of capacitor. That
        device is inside these spheres, seen in Flying Saucers. It takes
        a little bit of capital to build it, but not as much one rocket
        motor costs for the shuttle. Don't worry, the Nasa Rocket
        Propulsion Engineers were " Not interested, thank you!". So it
        probably will be used by another group that is interested in
        real space flight. We can reach the Moon in one day and Mars
        inside two weeks. Without the benefit of ostoporosis or
        barfbags. But who would deny those benefits to Astronauts? Not
        me. Joseph Hiddink vliegschotel@yahoo.com </p>

      <p>"The invention provides a capacity changer comprising at least
        one evacuated glass tube having an ionizable gas disposed
        therewithin and a pair of mutually spaced electrodes disposed
        within the glass tube and selectively connectable through a
        switch to a first power supply, the gas, when ionized, acting as
        a first capacitor electrode. A conductive coating on the outside
        of the or each glass tube forms a second capacitor electrode
        capacitively coupled to the first capacitor electrode when the
        gas is ionized, the first and second capacitor electrodes
        thereby forming a two-terminal capacitor. A second power supply
        is selectively connectable through a further switch between the
        second capacitor electrode and the first capacitor electrode
        when the gas is ionized, the second capacitor electrode further
        forming at least part of a 1- terminal capacitor when the gas is
        not ionized. The two-terminal capacitor formed by the ionized
        gas and the second capacitor electrode may be charged and then,
        when charged, converted into a one-terminal capacitor formed by
        the second capacitor electrode. In this way, very high voltages
        may be attained". </p>

      <p>Hi All, </p>
      <p>In 1967 I had the good (?) luck to figure out the workings of
        the Flying Saucer. The Propulsion System and how they are
        powered by taking energy right out of the air or aether. </p>
      <p>I built a small unit, went to 150,000 volts, got a heck of a
        poke and big bang was heard, the light went out. The Power
        Transformer on a pole 150 feet away had blown up. </p>
      <p>I was called out on business. When I came home a new
        Transformer had been installed. A squirrel was blamed. My TV and
        HiFi had been zapped. I blamed the Power Company, bought a slew
        of transistors and fixed the sets. </p>
      <p>A few weeks later I went to 500,000 volts, this time using long
        plastic rods to activate the switches and a scream from the kids
        above my workshop told me that the TV was on the blink again and
        so was the HiFi. Then the telephone of \all my neighbours around
        started to ring. "Could I come and have a look at their TV..?" </p>
      <p>Being on of these Good Neighbors of which you read in funny
        Novels, I fixed all sets for free but did not experiment at home
        anymore. Next experiment was in the "sticks". </p>
      <p>I got a lightning strike on the tree under which my Van was
        parked, set it afire, scared the daylights out of me and some
        poor farm dogs, which were instantly transformed into the
        fastest whippets you have ever seen. </p>
      <p>As a good Patriot I decided to offer the invention as a
        Birthday Gift to Canada. Canada was 100 years old! </p>
      <p>It was looked over by the National Research Council, the
        Scientific Arm of the Canadian Government. They concluded I was
        an Idiot. Nobody could ever invent the device I claimed to have
        invented, it said in the Physics Books that it was only a
        theoretical problem, originating by Faraday in the mid 1800's. </p>
      <p>No matter how many times I wrote and explained, they finally
        wrote to tell me that my letters would be henceforth in the
        wastebasket, unopened. </p>
      <p>Eleven years later, my (US) Patent Lawyer phoned me that the
        Patent was going to be granted. He urged me to inform the
        Governments of Canada and the USA immediately. "It is probably
        the biggest single invention I ever will have worked on and it
        could quite well be the Nobel Prize for you!" </p>
      <p>Dr. Kahn of the Hudson Institute had told him that it had been
        evaluated at $600 Billion if the USA would have it before
        Russia. That was for the Space Application alone! </p>
      <p>I wrote once more to the NRC. It was still ridiculed. I asked
        my MP to intervene. Four months after the patents were granted,
        the President of the NRC, Dr. Schneider, wrote a highly
        insulting letter (regarding me) to my MP., copy to the Premier,
        Mr. Trudeau, about this idiot, who did not know anything about
        Physics and could the Government do something to stop me from
        pestering them with his nonsense? </p>
      <p>I wrote a polite letter to this President, stating that someone
        must have mislead him, as I had the Patent now. I enclosed a
        copy of the Patent. </p>
      <p>A letter came back: "Yes, I had the Patent after all, but,
        "they" were sure that it could not work, no financial
        assistance!" </p>
      <p>I offered to come to Ottawa and have lightning come out of the
        clear blue sky. </p>
      <p>No answer. They tried it and the NRC Buildings were hit twelve
        times inside one hour. That item was even in the Newspapers! </p>
      <p>Now they had lost "face". They decided to keep on denying and
        poohooing this minor invention. In the USA it went to the
        Propulsion Lab of Nasa in Cleveland, Ohio. </p>
      <p>The learned gentlemen there were aghast. Who would need them if
        we could fly to the Moon in an hour or Mars inside a day? </p>
      <p>They were being paid big bucks and were not going to kill the
        Goose that laid Golden Eggs and (of course not) kickbacks from
        the different suppliers. </p>
      <p>"Not interested, than you for the copy of your Patent!" After
        the space disasters I believe that they decided to experiment
        with it and not knowing about precautions to be taken blew their
        own Power Transformer Station to Kingdom come and a poor
        innocent tree was blamed for the blackout.. One year after I got
        the Patents I went finally on the Web and read about a certain
        MR. Tesla. I realized that he had discovered the same thing. Two
        years later, while in the hospital with a heart-attack, due to a
        severe allergic reaction with Cashews. of which I had eaten a
        tin instead of making a TV dinner when my wife was visiting
        friends 600 Miles away, my wife came back home. She found the
        stack of rejecting and insulting letters and concluded that they
        were the reason for the heart attack. She did not want me to
        work on it anymore, the strain was too much for her. Love won. </p>
      <p>She passed away two years ago and now I am working on it again.
      </p>
      <p>First a unit that takes power out of the air to keep an
        industrial device with a 72 volt battery constantly charged. </p>
      <p>Next, a unit for home power. Then the real electric car like
        Tesla had. Next the power for air- and spacecraft. The fourth
        industrial revolution is coming. </p>
      <p>To ensure a long and happy life, I have given the complete
        circuitry to trusted people in Canada, the USA and Europe. </p>
      <p>If anything would happen to me it will be splashed all over the
        internet. </p>
      <p>The units will be leased, so as to get a constant income and
        keep the Tax man happy. Here in Canada the Ontario Provincial
        Government is not interested, the Politicians have their fingers
        in the Energy Pie, e-mail and faxes are not anwered. The Federal
        Government referred me to the Minister of the Environment who is
        all hopped up on getting the funding of many billions of dollars
        to bury Nuclear waste. No answer from him either. For 100
        Million Dollars we could fly it to the Moon or dump it at
        Jupiter. </p>
      <p>A real spacecraft can be as big as a football field and be
        crewed like a Naval Cruiser. Don't worry, the US Navy People
        were not interested, neither were the US Marines interested in a
        floating of flying vehicle to be used in hilly country like Iraq
        or Afghanistan . The poor Oil Barons in Calgary got $510 Million
        to fight pollution. With $5 million I will get better results
        than they ever will get. </p>
      <p>Patents are expired but I left one insignificant item out to
        ensure that an unfriendly power would not be able to use it. </p>
      <p>When I get enough capital I will have to take at least 1000
        patents out. There are myriads of applications. It is like
        inventing the wheel.&nbsp; Of course I might be on the wrong
        planet this time around. </p>
      <p>You also will understand that it is not something that should
        go to a University. </p>
      <p>Any disgruntled student could zap all the Computers,
        Cell-phones and even car computers. </p>

      <p><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>In the past, the changing of 2-terminal capacitors to
        1-terminal capacitors have been regarded largely as theoretical
        problems and devices. As for generators of high potentials, (in
        excess of 10 MeV), positive, negative or alternating in nature,
        they have been seen to be costly, cumersom and to need a fair
        amount of insulation. </p>
      <p>The present invention seeks to provide means and construction
        for attaining the foreging objects at relatively low cost and
        with good expectation of rewarding results. </p>
      <p><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</b> </p>
      <p>In order to understand clearly the nature of the present
        invention, and the best means for carrying it out, reference may
        be had to be the drawings in which like numerals denote similar
        parts throughout the several views. </p>
      <p>FIG. 1 shows a simple capacitor consisting of two conducting
        plates 10 and 11 which are separated by a dielectric medium 12
        which may be air or other insulating medium. On the other hand,
        there is shown in FIG. 2 a 1-terminal capacitor 13 which
        consists of only the single flat conducting plate 13. </p>
      <p>As shown in FIG. 3, there is depicted another type of
        1-terminal capacitor 14 consisting solely of a hollow sphere 14.
      </p>
      <p>Formulae for the calculation of the capacitance of various
        shapes of 2-terminal capacitors and of various shapes of
        1-terminal capacitors as shown in FIGS. 1, 2 and 3 are well
        known and given in various textbooks on electricity. The
        following shows how such elemental knowledge of capacitors is
        applied in development of the present invention in a novel form
        and construction. </p>
      <p>In FIG. 4A, the schematic circuit diagram shows the capacity
        changing circuit consisting of a 1-terminal capacitor 15
        consisting of a plate 16 which may be cylindrical in shape, and
        encloses or goes around a non-conducting gaseous discharge tube
        18 made of sealed glass or the like material, with electrodes 19
        and 20 inside the tube, and which is connected via lead wires 21
        to a battery 22 through a switch 23. </p>
      <p>In FIG. 4B, the schematic circuit diagram shows the realization
        of a 2-terminal capacitor 24 consisting of a plate 25 which may
        be cylindrical in shape which goes around a gaseous discharge
        tube 26 which is conducting. The ionized gas 27 within the tube
        26 acts as the second plate under the influence of the voltagee
        from battery 30 delivered via lead wires 31 through the switch
        32. The capacitance is indicated by the broken lines 33. </p>
      <p>As seen in FIGS. 5, 6 and 7, the basic capacitor of the present
        invention consists of one or more hollow tubes 34, 34A or 34B,
        which may be round, cylindrical or any other shape and made of
        non-conducting material such as glass. All of the tubes have end
        walls 36 at each end thereof and electrode terminals 38A or 38B
        are inserted through the sealed glass ends. The tubes are
        evacuated of air and filled with an ionizable gas 40 such as
        neon or argon, under suitable pressure. The tubes are partly
        covered with a conducting substance or coating 42, leaving the
        electrode terminals 38A and 38B free and insulated from the
        substance 42. The outside surface of each of the tubes 34, 34A
        and 34B are now for our purposes substance 42, which is a
        1-terminal capacitor. </p>
      <p>I have found that is is commercially advantageous to use a tube
        which does not have a phosphor coating, but which is otherwise
        similar to those used in the lighting industry. This type of
        tube, shown in FIG. 6, has heated filament-like terminals which
        make it possible to construct a high speed or fast-firing glow
        discharge circuit with a lower firing potential. </p>
      <p>Thus, FIG. 5 shows the tube 34A drawn as a glow discharge
        device, using power supply 50, switches 51 and 52 and electrode
        terminals 38A. FIG. 6 shows the similar arrangement but with
        tube 34B connected to the power supply 54, including switches 55
        and 56 and starters 57 at each end as is known in fluorescent
        lamp art. </p>
      <p>Looking at FIG. 7, there is shown a hollow metal sphere 60 with
        a spherical chamber 62, with a number of tubes like those shown
        at 34A and 42 in FIG. 5 or at 34B and 42 in FIG. 6 inside the
        chamber 62. The sphere 60 acts also as a 1-terminal capacitor,
        having its own capacity (C equals 0.556 d) and C is the capacity
        of pF, and d is the diameter of the conducting sphere in
        centimeters. Even if each tube 34 has its conducting surface 42
        connected to sphere 60, the capacity of the sphere remains the
        same, namely (C equals 0.556d). </p>
      <p>If the gas 40 inside the tubes 34A or 34B is ionized by an ac
        or dc power supply 66 through wires 68 and the switches shown in
        FIG. 7, and electrode terminals 38A and 38B as seen in FIGS. 5
        and 6, a 2-terminal capacitor is formed herein called capacitor
        70. Ionized gas 40 in each tube forms one plate and the
        conducting surface 42 forms the second plate. The glass tubes
        34A or 34B are the dielectric. </p>
      <p>This 2-terminal capacitor 70 can be of substantial value,
        depending on the size, shape or number of tubes 34-42 used
        inside the sphere. It will be noted that, although the capacitor
        70 can have a substantial value, the capacity value of the
        enveloping sphere 60 remains the same. </p>
      <p>Instead of mounting the tubes 34A or 34B in a sphere, they can
        be mounted in any other type of container with a conducting
        surface connected to the coating substance 42 by a wire 72 as
        shown in FIG. 7. However, for some purposes described herein, a
        sphere is the most efficient form. </p>
      <p>The 2-terminal capacitor array 70 can be charged by a direct
        current power supply 74, via switches 76 and 77 and conductors
        connected to the electrodes 38A or 38B on the ends of the tubes
        34 on one side, and another conductor 78 going to the conducting
        coating substance 42 on each tube. Whether ionized gas 40
        forming one plate of the capacitor or conducting coating
        substance 42 connected to sphere 60 as the other plate becomes
        positive or negative depends on the connection of power supply
        74. Versatility can be achieved by using three-position switches
        or relays for switching at 76 and 77 of FIG. 7. </p>
      <p>After the 2-terminal capacitor 70 has attained a charge, power
        supply 74 can be disconnected from the capacitor 70 by means of
        breaking the charging path via switch 76 or 77 or both. The
        connection from power supply 74 to conductors 42 should be
        broken to safeguard power supply 74. </p>
      <p>The plate formed by ionized gas 40 in each tube can now be
        removed by disconnecting power supply 66 via switches 80 or 81
        or both. When using a filament-type tube 34B as in FIG. 6, it is
        advisable to disconnect the filament-heating power supplies via
        starter switches 57 or both. </p>
      <p>When fast action is required in the changing to state from 2-
        or 1-terminal capacitor operation, the gas 40 can have quenching
        type additives as known in the art. The charge on the other
        plate (sphere 60 connected to conductors 42) remains. If
        capacitor 70 (2-terminal capacitor array) had a capacity of 10
        microfarads (which can be attained by using a sufficient number
        of the tubes 34-42) and was charged up to 10,000 volts, the
        charge would be 1/10 Coulom (Q equals CV). If the capacity of
        the sphere 60 was, for example 100 pF (picofarads), the
        potential which is generated is momentarily about 100 million
        volts. </p>
      <p>It is thus seen that the invention furnishes solutions to
        various problems as mentioned above, and at reasonable cost of
        equipment and power supply. </p>
      <p>Although the invention has been described in specific terms, it
        will be apparent to those skilled in the art that there are many
        modifications, changes and improvements which may be made
        therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the
        invention as herein claimed. Further, if desired, the switching
        arrangements at 76, 77, 80 and 81 of FIG. 7 may be mounted
        inside the sphere 60, if convenient.<br>

      <br>
      ...Now I've known a certain very private Canadian inventor for
      many years...he's brilliant, Joseph Hiddink.<br>
      <br>
      So I had been looking for info on how the Hurwich device might
      have worked to 'alter the center of gravity of any conductive
      mass' when Hiddink says he invented it and Hurwich visited his lab
      and stole the&nbsp; secret, then copied and claimed he invented
      it.<br>
      <br>
      I didn't believe him at first, then he explained how it was
      done...all from his 'one terminal capacitor' patents with similar
      effects to what&nbsp; you are claiming...<br>
      <br>
      <a href="http://keelynet.com/interact/archive/00000405.htm"
        "><b>http://keelynet.com/interact/archive/00000405.htm</b></a><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Two metal concentric spheres form a capacitor C.<br>
      <br>
      This is charged up to a potential V.<br>
      <br>
      Then the outside sphere is removed.<br>
      <br>
      The remaining sphere is a 1-terminal capacitor with a capacity c.<br>
      <br>
      The potential on this sphere is C/c x V. If C+ 1 microfarad, and c
      = 50 micromicrofarad, and V = 1000 volts, we get a momentarily
      pulse of 20<br>
      million volts.<br>
      <br>
      And that is positive all alone, or negative all alone. Of course
      that is difficult to do with these spheres, so the books caution
      that it was "Just a theoretical problem".<br>
      <br>
      Bu what if we can make a 2-terminal capacitor that can be charged
      up, and then can be changed into a 1-terminal capacitor? That is
      what I invented 30 seconds after thinking about it..<br>
      <br>
      This type of capacitor is inside every sphere, with the 1-terminal
      part connected to the sphere. As no charge can exist inside the
      sphere, it flows to the outside.<br>
      <br>
      If a sphere sits on the ground, and gives such a pulse, the first
      pulse may not do much, but the succeeding ones do. Earth will
      repel that sphere. And once off the ground, the electrical field
      off the sphere (with succeeding pulses) "sees" the earth's
      magnetic field as "ground" and tries to get away from it.<br>
      <br>
      And that is how it works. The saucer shape is nothing but a
      reflector. Steering is accomplished by applying the proper amount
      of power to each<br>
      sphere with a joy stick. A sixteen year old girl with heavy
      glasses and normal IQ could fly it.<br>
      <br>
      Offered to Canada as a birthday present in 1967, it was ridiculed
      by the NRC (Canada), as nobody ever could invent such a capacitor,
      and as thus<br>
      it was rejected. Confronted many years later with the patent, they
      had to lamely admit, that it could be done after all, but the NRC
      (Canada) was "Sure that it could not work, no funding!".<br>
      <br>
      After which the President of that institution retired immediately
      But not before exhorting his successor to keep this invention in
      the ridicule section. His successor became head of the Canadian
      Space Agency. If you apply for a patent, you need the signature of
      two witnessse, who declare that they understand the invention.<br>
      <br>
      One of the witnesses required, was a German, now Canadian
      Engineer, who had worked on Hitler's Flying Disk. "My God, why did
      nobody think about that before...? Why did I not think about that
      before...?"<br>
      <br>
      And he told me about Hitler's Flying Machine that never worked.
      "When the project was terminated, we were sworn to secrecy about
      it, but that<br>
      is nonsense now, you found it. .. Why did I not think about it
      before...?" He happens to be the world's foremost expert on the
      parts to make this capacitor.<br>
      <br>
      Offered to Nasa, the Rocket Experts at the Propulsion Lab, where I
      was<br>
      referred to, were "Not interested, thank you.!" You can figure out
      why.<br>
      <br>
      We can fly to the Moon in three hours, if need be, uncomfortable.
      Or in comfort, using a constant 1.1 g acceleration in two days.
      Mars in a few<br>
      weeks. No osteoporosis and no barfbags. The Space station and all
      that nonsense is obsolete.<br>
      <br>
      Of course, anyone who can find out how a Flying Saucer works must
      be an idiot. that is, what I was told at the different
      "Scientific" Institutes in Canada.<br>
      <br>
      Invention was evaluated by Hermann... (forgot his last name) of
      the Hudson Institute for Strategical Studies at $600 Billion. Now
      probably<br>
      Trillion.<br>
      <br>
      Found 1200 applications, from "Starwar" cars that float,
      electrical engines that need only a battery to start, airplanes
      that reach any place on earth in two hours, all VTOL, no airports
      needed, to inexpensive power generators, weather control,
      tornadoes, hurricanes, earthquakes etc... Oil as an energy source
      will be out. No pollution and no noise.<br>
      <br>
      Just new to the net I will probably get my own site and start to
      advertise some applications. I have to make some money too. I
      wondered of course why the Patent Office never figured that this
      invention should be "classified", but you never argue with the
      dumbells that look after your security. Your security Council was
      informed before too.<br>
      <br>
      Threaten the President of the US, and CIA and FBI will be at your
      doorstep in five minutes. If all of the US could be in danger, if
      this invention is used by another party, who cares... Do have a
      nice day.<br>
      <br>

      </b>Initial experiment in 1967, zapped all the HiFi's and TV's in
      the neighborhood (I fixed them all for free, but did not
      experiment at home <br>
      anymore, as it also blew after a few seconds a big Power
      Transformer on a pole 100 yards away, luckily a Squirrel was
      blamed).<br>
      <br>
      Next experiment in the "sticks" had me lightning coming out of the
      clear blue sky, when I connected the device with a dog-screw to
      ground, and generated three pulses of 500,000 volts. Offered to
      Nasa's Propulsion Lab in Cleveland, it was solidly rejected by the
      engineers.<br>
      <br>
      "Thank you for sending us a copy of your patent!" Who needs a
      propulsion&nbsp; engineer, if we, when using this system can be on
      the Moon in a few <br>
      hours or at Mars in a day or so, no matter where they are located
      at the time, and all that without barf-bags, heat-tiles, or
      osteoporosis? I <br>
      believe that they tried it a few years ago and caused the big
      blackout in the USA and Canada, blaming a poor, innocent tree.<br>
      <br>
      They did not know about what precautions to take. Any other
      experiment&nbsp; that you are working on is just a novelty without
      any real desirable <br>
      results...<br>

      Received this interesting response from Joseph regarding his
      patent and its uses/abuses....I had reservations about posting the
      entire thing to the list but it has so many good comments it just
      has to be shared. He indicates he is working on a website and I'll
      pass the URL on as soon as it is up;<br>
      <br>
      With regard to the 'one terminal capacitor' Joseph Hiddink writes;<br>
      <br>
      When I invented it, I managed to get GE to make three tubes for
      me.<br>
      <br>
      When using one tube I got 150,000 volts and a heck of a poke.
      After that I used a long stick to manipulate the switches. Then a
      few weeks<br>
      later I went to 500,000 volts, and caused quite an uproar by
      zapping not just my own HiFi and TV for the second time, but also
      zapping all<br>
      my neighbour's TV's. Being a good neighbour, I fixed them all for
      free, but I did not experiment at home anymore.<br>
      <br>
      With the making of a " magic wand" I was able to lift small
      pebbles. Now I am getting more tubes made for me.<br>
      <br>
      Beware! When you let too many people see the patent, anyone can
      zap all computers and all electronic devices in the neighbourhood,
      including alarm systems. In the wrong hands it can be used to
      start natural disasters like earthquakes etc.<br>
      <br>
      The patent is so-called expired, but I was not allowed for years
      to do anything, as I had found that it could be used as a Intense
      Neutron Generator. It took many years before the Atomic Energy
      Comission allowed me to write anbout the patent.<br>
      <br>
      So I have been asking about extensions for this basic patent.
      Others are coming. I found about 1200 applications, from electric
      fence to weather control. Being just a poor piano tuner at ther
      moment, and being new to the net, I will get my website soon and
      start to advertise for Venture Capiital.<br>
      <br>
      Ever heard about Edgar Cayce? When I wrote to the institution that
      keeps his records, his son Hugh, wrote me to tell that "Father
      said, that when it will be invented, it will be an industrial
      revolution like the world never has seen before.." Realizing that
      some industries like oil will probably disappear, I have already
      offered some interest to oil producers.<br>
      <br>
      Yes, there is a minimum size, depending on the size of the tubes,
      and the spheres. And unlike the Wrtight Brothers, who could use
      their knowledge as bicycle repairmen, it needs some understanding
      of electronics. And a healthy respect of high voltage.<br>
      <br>
      I tried once, and got lightning coming out of the clear sky, when
      I<br>
      experimented in the "sticks" I have never seen dogs, that were
      coming to investigate me run so fast. As for size of a Flying
      machine, a minimum size is probably 20 feet for a FS to carry one
      person.<br>
      <br>
      The spheres (I bought some old propane tanks, but had trouble
      cutting them open) will probably made of aluminum. They could even
      be used to propel a goodsized airplane. But Boeing was not
      interested., Nor were the Nasa rocket propulsion specialists.<br>
      <br>
      In Canada it was of course laughed out our so-called Science
      Groups.<br>
