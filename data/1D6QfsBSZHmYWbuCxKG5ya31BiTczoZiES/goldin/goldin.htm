      Researchers and companies have been trying for decades to capture
      the energy of waves to produce electric power, but the latest wave
      energy invention comes from an unlikely source: Aaron Goldin, a
      senior at San Dieguito High School Academy in Encinitas,
      California. In December, Goldin won the $100,000 Grand Prize
      scholarship from the 2004-2005 Siemens Westinghouse Competition in
      Math, Science and Technology, the nation's premiere high school
      science competition, for his invention of the "Gyro-Gen," a
      gyroscope that converts ocean wave energy into electricity. The
      spinning gyroscope, mounted in a buoy, resists the movement of the
      waves by exerting torque on a crank, which turns an electric
      generator. Goldin created his gyroscope prototypes in his garage,
      scavenging an old tape recorder, answering machine, and other
      household appliances for parts. The invention also won the
      prestigious California Sea Grant John D. Isaacs Scholarship for
      outstanding ocean engineering research in 2004.<br>

          Aaron Goldin, whom we posted about here has won top prize in
          the Siemens-Westinghouse high school science competition for a
          wave energy device as reported in this story at MSNBC.
          Unfortunately, the $100,000 prize will go to Mr. Goldin's
          college. Too bad that it can't be used to actually develop
          Goldin's device because with the current state of affairs in
          wave energy development, the project may never be built. Of
          course, $100,000 isn't much or nearly enough - but quite
          frankly, it's more than what's available to any US wave energy
          developer at this time. <br>

          ENCINITAS – Using old appliance parts in his garage,
          17-year-old Aaron Goldin spent two years building an
          environmentally friendly device that converts ocean wave
          energy into electricity.<br>
          <br>
          The San Dieguito High School Academy senior constructed the
          gyroscopic, wave-powered generator for the pure love of
          science, rather than for a class project or grade.<br>
          <br>
          However, his research generated first-place awards in county,
          state and international science fairs. And most recently, he
          won the prestigious Western Regional Finals of the Siemens
          Westinghouse Competition in Math, Science and Technology.
          He'll compete next month in Washington, D.C., against five
          others for a top prize of $100,000.<br>
          <br>
          Aaron said he's honored by the recognition, but more pleased
          to have possibly discovered a practical, environmentally
          friendly way to generate electrical power. He's seeking to
          patent his invention.<br>
          <br>
          "I've always been interested in the environment, and growing
          up right next to the beach I've observed and appreciated the
          power of the wave," he said. "Gyroscopes I've played with
          since I was a little kid. I'd balance them and hook them up to
          motors."<br>
          <br>
          The Siemens Foundation in New Jersey is an extension of
          engineering and telecommunications giant Siemens. It has
          promoted its competition for six years to motivate student
          involvement in math and science, and it awards more than $1
          million in scholarships annually.<br>
          <br>
          The competition drew 1,250 high school entries from across the
          nation, and one individual student winner from six regions
          will compete next month. Aaron has already won a $3,000
          scholarship and will come away with at least $10,000 more for
          competing in the final round.<br>
          <br>
          To build his device, Aaron adapted a retired computer printer
          part for the generator. The motor was from an old answering
          machine. The gyroscope was from a flywheel from an older-style
          reel-to-reel tape deck.<br>
          <br>
          His project was evaluated by a team of scientists and faculty
          at the University of California Berkeley. Lead judge Roger
          Falcone, a UC Berkeley physics professor, said Aaron's use of
          a gyroscope was creative, original and impressive because of
          its simplicity.<br>
          <br>
          "For many years, people have known that wave energy is very
          powerful, but his solution using a gyroscope is novel," he
          said. "We actually looked on the Web and at the patent office,
          and we couldn't find any work done on this."<br>
          <br>
          Aaron said he believed the gyroscope might generate electrical
          power from waves because it would automatically push back
          against them, enabling it to absorb wave energy. Aaron said
          his device is a free-floating system that is environmentally
          benign.<br>
          <br>
          Aaron is a straight-A student who packs his schedule with
          rigorous Advanced Placement classes, which cover material in a
          more sophisticated way. He earned top marks on Advanced
          Placement physics, calculus, chemistry and U.S. history tests,
          earning him college credit for those courses.<br>
          <br>
          He has nonacademic interests as well. Aaron played the
          trombone for local youth orchestras and currently plays for
          Band in Black, a local jazz group. He plays piano and composes
          music for fun.<br>
          <br>
          He is an avid reader, and his favorite book is "Crime and
          Punishment" by Fyodor Dostoevsky. With his friends, Aaron
          plays computer games such as "Warcraft III" and
          "Counter-Strike."<br>
          <br>
          Someday Aaron would like to be a university research professor
          in physics or engineering. His dad is an engineer, and Aaron's
          parents are proud of their son's scientific work.<br>
          <br>
          "He doesn't care so much about the money, as much as the honor
          of being able to participate in such a prestigious
          competition," said his mother, Linda Goldin. "He really cares
          about what his invention could possibly do for the environment
          as an alternative energy source. It's nice his work has a
          purpose to better society, and he feels strongly about it.
          That makes me feel good."<br>

      <b>Abstract</b> -- Techniques and devices that use precession of
      at least one spinning gyroscope to drive a motor generator to
      produce electricity from an oscillating motion that causes the
      precession of the gyroscope. A buoy may be used to produce the
      oscillating motion from the motion of water waves so that
      electricity may be produced from motion of water waves. An
      oscillating motion caused by other sources, such as wind, may also
      be used to generate electricity.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      This application relates to conversion of energy of a mechanical
      motion into electrical energy.<br>
      <br>
      Energy is a valuable resource. A variety of techniques have been
      and are being developed to generate energy from various sources,
      such as the coal, oil, natural gas, hydrogen, sunlight, wind, and
      ocean waves. Certain energy resources are limited on earth and are
      not renewable. Examples of such energy sources include the fossil
      fuels like coal, oil, and natural gas, and nuclear fuels such as
      uranium. The fossil fuels, uranium and other non-renewable energy
      sources will eventually be depleted on earth by continuous
      exploration and use. The consumption and use of many non-renewable
      energy sources such as fossil fuels and nuclear fuels are also
      known for causing pollutions to the environments.<br>
      <br>
      In contrast, certain other energy resources, such as the sunlight,
      wind, and ocean waves, are practically unlimited in their supply
      and may be utilized in ways that can significantly reduce or
      minimize adverse impacts to the environments and the earth's
      ecological systems. Therefore, techniques, devices and systems for
      obtaining energy from various sources other than fossil fuels and
      nuclear fuels are desirable to preserve earth's natural resources,
      to reduce pollution to the environments, and to expand energy
      supply sources in order to provide sustainable energy supply to
      humans.<br>
      <br>
      For example, the motion of water waves in a large body of water,
      e.g., lakes, rivers, and oceans, may be used to generate
      electricity. Oceans, in particular, have an enormous potential as
      a source of energy in part because oceans cover over 70% of the
      earth's surface and are estimated to have an annual capacity of
      about 2000 tera watt-hour in the surface wave energy alone.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      This application describes implementations of techniques and
      devices that use a spinning gyroscope to convert an oscillating
      torque caused by an oscillating motion into a continuous torque
      acting on an electromagnetic motor generator and thus cases a
      continuous rotation of the electromagnetic motor generator which
      generates electricity. In one implementation, for example, a
      method is described to use a spinning gyroscope to convert an
      oscillating motion into a continuous rotation motion and to cause
      the continuous rotation motion to activate an electromagnetic
      motor-generator to generate electricity.<br>
      <br>
      In another implementation, an exemplary device is described to
      include a base reactive to an oscillating motion acting on the
      base; a gyroscope engaged to the base and operable to precess in
      response to the oscillating motion of the base when the gyroscope
      is spinning; an electromagnetic motor-generator to rotate and to
      generate electricity; and a coupling unit coupled between the
      gyroscope and the electromagnetic motor-generator to transfer the
      precession of the gyroscope to continuous rotation of the
      electromagnetic motor-generator, thus converting energy of the
      oscillating motion into electricity.<br>
      <br>
      In yet another implementation, a device is described to include a
      floating device to float in water and a base engaged to the
      floating device to be substantially parallel to a water surface at
      a location where the base is located. This device includes a
      gyroscope engaged to the base and operable to precess, when the
      gyroscope is spinning, in response to an oscillating motion of the
      base when floating on the water. An electromagnetic
      motor-generator is engaged to the base and to rotate around a
      motor rotation axis that is perpendicular to the base. This device
      includes crank arm engaged to the electromagnetic motor-generator
      and operable to rotate the electromagnetic motor-generator and
      engaged to the gyroscope so that an axis of the spinning of the
      gyroscope is parallel to the crank arm. The crank arm is operable
      to transfer the precession of the gyroscope into continuous
      rotation of the electromagnetic motor-generator, thus converting
      energy of the oscillating motion into electricity. A control
      module is coupled to control spinning of the gyroscope according
      to a frequency of the oscillating motion.<br>
      <br>
      These and other implementations are described in greater detail in
      the attached drawings, the detailed description and the claims.<br>

      <b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</b><br>
      <br>
      The techniques and devices described in this application use a
      spinning gyroscope to convert an oscillating torque caused by an
      oscillating motion into a continuous torque acting on an
      electromagnetic motor generator and thus cases a continuous
      rotation of the electromagnetic motor generator. The
      electromagnetic motor generator generates electricity from the
      continuous rotation. A coupling mechanism is provided to transfer
      or transform the precession motion of the spinning gyroscope under
      the oscillating torque into the continuous rotation of the motor
      generator. As described in detail below, the use of the spinning
      gyroscope and the coupling mechanism can be implemented in simple
      and efficient configurations that convert the energy of an
      oscillating motion into electricity for a variety of applications.<br>
      <br>
      The implementation of the combination of the spinning gyroscope
      and the coupling mechanism may be adapted different to efficiently
      interact with different forms of oscillating motions. For example,
      the oscillating motion may be caused by a natural phenomenon such
      as water waves in, e.g., oceans and winds. Specific examples are
      described here for designs that directly convert the periodic
      torque of oscillating surface waves in a body of water such as
      ocean waves into the continuous torque acting on a rotary electric
      generator which in turn generates electricity. The spinning
      gyroscope, which sometimes may be used as an inertial frame of
      reference such as a horizontal spinning top, is configured to
      continuously precess harmonically to the oscillating motion of the
      ocean waves, usually with varying amplitudes and periods. This
      precession of the spinning gyroscope is then used to drive the
      rotary motor generator to continuously rotate and thus generate
      electricity. The entirety or a portion of the generated
      electricity may be directly used to power an electric load or
      device. The entirety or a portion of the generated electricity may
      also be used to charge up a rechargeable battery to store the
      generated energy or be stored in other energy storage device. In
      some applications, the generated electricity may be partially used
      to drive an electric load or device while the remainder of the
      generated electricity is being stored.<br>
      <br>
      In certain implementations, the spinning motion of the gyroscope
      may be initiated or initially powered by a power supply such as a
      battery. After the initial spinning of the gyroscope, the combined
      operation of the spinning gyroscope and the coupling mechanism
      generate electricity from a specific oscillating motion with which
      the system is designed to interact. While a portion of or the most
      of the generated electricity may be sent to the storage device or
      may be used to drive the electric load, a portion of the generated
      electricity from the rotary electric generator is partitioned out
      of the generated electricity and is used to power the spinning
      motion of the gyroscope. Therefore, after the initial powering by
      the power supply, the gyroscope may be controlled to cease
      receiving energy from the power supply after the partitioned
      portion of the electricity generated by the motor is sufficient to
      maintain spinning of the gyroscope. The power supply for the
      initial spinning of the gyroscope may be a rechargeable battery
      that can be recharged by the generated electricity. Therefore,
      under this particular design, a gyroscope-based generator may be a
      self-powered, autonomous system when the spinning gyroscope, the
      precession of the gyroscope and the oscillating motion are in
      phase and in resonance with one another.<br>
      <br>
      In other implementations, gyroscope-based generators based on the
      present combined operation of the spinning gyroscope and the
      coupling mechanism may be configured to initiate the spinning of
      the gyroscope without using energy from a power supply. The
      oscillating motion caused by a suitable source such as the ocean
      waves or winds can be used to cause the coupling mechanism to
      rotate the rotary electromagnetic motor generator to generate the
      electricity. This electricity is then used to spin up the
      gyroscope until the spinning gyroscope, the precession of the
      gyroscope and the oscillating motion are in phase and in resonance
      with one another. After this initial spin-up of the gyroscope, a
      part of the generated electricity is used to sustain the spinning
      of the gyroscope while the remaining part of the generated
      electricity is used to drive an electric load or to be stored in a
      storage device.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 1 illustrates one example of a gyroscope-based generator 100
      described in this application. A platform or base member 140 is
      provided to interact with an oscillating object or an oscillating
      force and to support a gyroscope 110 and an electromagnetic rotary
      motor generator 130. The oscillating motion of the platform or
      base member 140 causes an oscillating torque to be applied to the
      spinning gyroscope 110 and thus maintains the precession of the
      gyroscope 110. When the gyroscope 110 spins around its own
      spinning axis, the oscillating torque acts on the gyroscope 110 as
      an external torque and causes the gyroscope 110 to precess. A
      coupling mechanism 120, e.g., a mechanical transmission or
      coupler, is coupled between the precessing gyroscope 110 and the
      rotary motor 130 to transfer the precession of the gyroscope 110
      to the rotation of the rotary motor 130. The rotation energy of
      the rotary motor 130 is converted into electricity.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 2 illustrates the energy conversion in the gyroscope
      generator 100. The oscillating motion of the platform 140 and the
      spinning motion of the gyroscope 110 are coupled to each other to
      cause precession of the spinning gyroscope 110. This coupling
      essentially converts the energy of the oscillating motion of the
      platform 140 into the energy of the precession of the spinning
      gyroscope 110. The precession of the spinning gyroscope 110 is
      then converted by the coupling mechanism 120 into a continuous
      rotation of the rotary motor 130 which produces the electricity
      energy from the rotation. The generated electricity is then used
      to power a load or device or is stored in a rechargeable battery.
      As illustrated, a portion of the generated electricity may be used
      to power and maintain the spinning of the gyroscope 110.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 3 shows a simple gyroscope 110 that may be used in the device
      100 in FIG. 1. The gyroscope 110 operates based on the Newton's
      principle that a massive rapidly spinning body rigidly resists
      perturbation and reacts to a disturbing torque by precessing or
      rotating slowly around a precession axis orthogonal to the axis of
      the disturbing torque and the axis of the gyroscope's spin vector.
      As illustrated, the angular momentum of the gyroscope 110 can be
      represented by a vector (Li) along the axis of the spinning
      rotation. When the angle ([theta]) of the gyroscope 110 changes
      due to an external disturbing torque, the angular momentum vector
      changes. While the magnitude of the angular momentum (L) is
      constant, the initial angular momentum (Li) and the final angular
      momentum (Lf) differ. Thus, due to the conservation of angular
      momentum, a resultant angular momentum vector (N) is introduced
      and the sum of N and Lf is equal to Li.<br>
      <br>
      The change in the component of N, (Np), oriented along the axis of
      precession, which is the crank arm axis in an example described
      below, is ¦¦Np¦¦=L sin([theta]) for one quarter of a full cycle.
      Because Np is the change in Li that contributes to the torque
      turning the crank arm of the device 100, and the average torque<br>
      <br>
      [mathematical formula - see original document]<br>
      <br>
      can be expressed as follows:<br>
      <br>
      [tau]=4Lf sin([theta]),<br>
      <br>
      where f is the frequency of the oscillating object or force such
      as ocean waves. Thus the theoretical input power from the torque
      caused by the oscillating object or force is:<br>
      <br>
      Pin=8[pi]f&lt;2&gt; L sin [theta].<br>
      <br>
      As an example, consider an implementation of the design in FIG. 1
      where a crank arm is used as the coupling mechanism 120 between
      the gyroscope 110 and the rotary motor 130. If the gyroscope 110
      spins at a gyro rate of 90 r.p.s. and the frequency of the wave
      stimulator which simulates ocean waves to rock the device 100 is
      1.25 Hz, the gyroscope generator 100 in FIG. 1 can generate 0.817
      W of electricity for a wave angle of 20[deg.] and a crank arm of a
      radius at 0.1 meter.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 4 illustrates one exemplary implementation of the gyroscope
      generator 400 based on the design in FIG. 1. The gyroscope
      generator 400 includes a gyroscope 410 with a gyro wheel 412
      driven by a gyro motor 418, a rotary motor generator 460, and a
      crank arm 430 as part of the coupling mechanism to transfer the
      precession of the gyroscope 410 to the rotation of the rotary
      motor generator 460. The entire system is mounted on a base 480.<br>
      <br>
      The gyro wheel 412 of the gyroscope 410 is mounted to spin around
      a gyro axle 414 that is substantially parallel to the crank arm
      430 and to the base 480. The gyro axle 414 is engaged to and is
      rotated by the gyro motor 418 to cause the gyro wheel 412 to spin.
      A gyroscope power supply, such as a battery, may be used to supply
      the electrical power to the gyro motor 418 for, at the minimum,
      initiating the spin of the gyro wheel 412 so that the oscillating
      motion of the base 408 can cause the gyroscope 410 to precess. A
      gyro bracket 416 is structured to hold the gyro wheel 412, the
      gyro axle 414, and the gyro motor 418 together as the assembled
      gyroscope 410. A mechanical coupler or coupling element 420 may be
      used to engage the gyro bracket 416 to the crank arm 430. In this
      configuration, as the gyroscope 410 precesses in response to the
      external oscillating motion exerted on the generator 400, the
      precession motion of the gyroscope 410 causes the crank arm 430 to
      rotate via the coupling element 420.<br>
      <br>
      The crank arm 430 in the illustrated example is engaged to a first
      rotational axel 440 that is substantially perpendicular to the
      crank arm 430 and the gyro axel 414. When the gyroscope 410
      precesses, the crank arm 430 rotates around the axel 440 along
      with the precession of the gyroscope 410. The crank arm 430 may be
      configured in various geometries. For example, the crank arm 430
      may be a circular plate with its center engaged to the axel 440 so
      that the plate spins or rotates around the axel 440. The crank arm
      439 includes a crank hub 432 that is engaged to the axel 440. The
      gyroscope 410 may be positioned on the crank arm 430 off the first
      axel 440, or alternatively, near or at the axel 440. The axel 440
      may be the rotary axel of the rotary motor generator 460. In the
      illustrated example, a pair of reduction gears 442 and 444 are
      used to transfer the rotation of the axel 440 to the rotation of a
      second, substantially parallel axel 450 which is the rotary axel
      of the motor generator 460. The gear 442 is engaged to rotate with
      the axel 440 and the gear 444 is engaged to rotate with the axel
      450. The gears 442 and 444 are engaged to each other so their
      rotary motions are synchronized and may be sized with different
      diameters, e.g., the diameter of the gear 442 is greater than that
      of the gear 444, to rotate the motor 460 at a higher angular
      velocity than the axel 440. Therefore, in the illustrated example,
      the combination of the crank arm 430, the axel 440, the pair of
      reduction gears 442 and 444 forms the coupling mechanism 120 in
      FIG. 1. Other suitable implementations of the coupling mechanism
      120 may be used.<br>
      <br>
      The gyroscope generator 400 is further shown to use a generator
      frame 490 on a bottom plate 482 to hold the motor 460, the
      reduction gears 442 and 444, and the first axel 440. Electrical
      connectors and circuits (e.g., rectifiers) 470 for the rotary
      motor generator 460 may also be placed in the generator frame 470.
      The bottom plate 482 may be directly engaged to the base 480.<br>
      <br>
      The gyroscope generator 400 may be adapted to interact with
      various oscillating motions to generate electricity. For example,
      the base 480 or an extension connected to the base 480 may be used
      to interact with wind to cause the base 480 to oscillate with the
      wind and to generate electricity. As another example, a floating
      device or a buoy may be engaged to the base 408 and the entire
      system can float on the ocean to generate electricity from the
      oscillating motion of the ocean waves.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 5 shows an example of a buoy gyroscope generator 500. A
      waterproof chamber or housing 510 is provided to enclose the
      generator 400 in FIG. 4. The housing 510&nbsp; includes a buoy
      hull 512 with a bottom 518 and a top opening that is sealed by a
      lid 514. A Teflon gasket 516 and fasteners may be used to engage
      the lid 514 to the top opening and to provide a waterproof seal.
      The base 408 of the gyroscope generator 400 is fixed to the bottom
      518 of the housing 510 to facilitate the energy transfer from the
      motion of the waves to the motion of the housing 510. In
      operation, the housing 510 floats on the water surface to keep the
      bottom 518 and thus the base 408 to be parallel to the water
      surface when the water is calm without waves. When waves are
      present in the water, the up-and-down oscillating motion of the
      waves causes the gyroscope generator 400 inside the housing 510 to
      move accordingly with the waves and this motion of the gyroscope
      generator 400 in turn causes the gyroscope 410 to precess and to
      rotate the crank arm 430 which turns the rotary motor generator
      460.<br>
      <br>
      The housing 510 may be engaged to a set of elongated plates or
      blades, which extend vertically into the water, to provide lateral
      stability of the housing 510 and to ensure that the bottom 518 of
      the housing 510 faces downward. As illustrated in FIG. 5, a set of
      radial keel blades 530, e.g., four blades, may be engaged to the
      bottom portion of the housing 510 via keel attachments struts or
      other suitable fasteners 520. These blades interact with water to
      transfer the water wave motion into the motion of the housing 510.
      Hence, the up and down circulating movement of the waves rocks the
      housing 510 and causes the precession of the gyroscope 410 inside
      the housing 510. In addition, additional weights 540 may be
      attached to the bottom side of the housing 510 to further
      stabilize the system in the upright position.<br>
      <br>
      In the designs shown in FIGS. 4 and 5, the angular momentum of the
      gyroscope 410 can be computed by L=I[omega], where I is the moment
      of inertia of the gyro wheel, and [omega] is the spinning angular
      velocity of the gyroscope. As an example, if the gyro wheel of the
      gyroscope 410 is a ring, the moment of the ring is given by:<br>
      <br>
      [mathematical formula - see original document]<br>
      <br>
      where M1 is the projected mass of a disk with the outer radius of
      the ring, and M2 is the projected mass of a disk with the inner
      radius of the ring, and r1 and r2 are the outer and inner radii,
      respectively.<br>
      <br>
      Consider a specific configuration for the above example as
      follows:<br>
      <br>
      M=0.47 [kg],<br>
      r1=0.046 [m],<br>
      r2=0.03 [m],<br>
      M/m&lt;2&gt; =123.031 [kg/m&lt;2&gt; ],<br>
      M1=0.817862 [kg] and<br>
      M2=0.347862 [kg],<br>
      <br>
      The moment is I=0.000709 [kg.m&lt;2&gt; ], the angular momentum
      is&nbsp; L=I[omega]=0.400794 [kg.m&lt;2&gt; [omega]] and the input
      power for spinning the gyroscope is Pin=8[pi]f&lt;2 &gt; L
      sin([theta])=5.383 [W]. The gyroscope 410 in the designs shown in
      FIGS. 4 and 5 is offset to the crank arm axis 440 so that there is
      a small addition of power from the potential energy of the height
      of the gyroscope 410 due to gravity introduced every cycle. This
      part of the contribution can be expressed by Pgravity=4rMg
      sin([theta])f, where g is the acceleration of gravity. For the
      specific numbers used above, Pgravity=0.788 [W]. Accordingly, the
      total input power to the system is 6.171 [W]. In a simplified
      testing prototype generator based on the above numbers, the
      measured electrical load power Pload is 0.817 W. Therefore, the
      efficiency of the prototype generator, Pload/Pin, is 0.817
      [W]/6.171 [W]=0.132, or 13.2%.<br>
      <br>
      FIGS. 6A and 6B illustrate exemplary circuits for the rotary motor
      generator and the driver circuit for the gyro motor that spins the
      gyroscope, respectively, in a simplified testing prototype. In
      this example, a gyro power supply such as a battery is provided to
      supply the electrical power to initially spin up the gyroscope. A
      tri-axial accelerometer is used to measure the motion of the
      prototype platform. An oscilloscope is used to measure the rate of
      rotation of the gyroscope. The motor-generator energizes the test
      load and can be switched to provide power to the gyroscope motor
      in FIG. 6B. A data recorder records the accelerometer and
      generator outputs.<br>
      <br>
      The designs in FIGS. 4 and 5 may be configured with the capability
      to resonate at different wave frequencies under simple controls.
      The system resonates when the wave frequency and the gyroscopic
      precession frequency are the same or are sufficiently close to
      each other to be in resonance with each other. This resonant
      condition occurs when the torque that the gyroscope 410 exerts on
      the generator crank arm 430 with respect to the crank arm axis is
      equal but opposite to the torque the generator 400 exerts on the
      gyroscope 410. Under the resonance condition, the ratio between
      torque and angular momentum can be expressed as<br>
      <br>
      [tau]/L=4f sin([theta]).<br>
      <br>
      As long as this ratio is maintained during operation, the device
      can resonate at any given wave frequency and angle.<br>
      <br>
      A simple prototype, Gyro-Gen, based on the designs in FIGS. 4 and
      5 was successfully built and tested. The main components of this
      prototype are a gyroscope (adapted from a Sony capstan flywheel,
      shaft, and bearing set), a gyro motor with 9V DC and 20 ohms
      impedance, a crank arm made of a 1.27*28.3 cm aluminum rod, an
      electric generator (adapted from a 4-phase synchronous motor
      Superior Electric model MD62-FC09/1.7 V/4.7 A/65 oz.in torque), a
      control circuit (10A Schottky diode rectifiers), and a housing.
      The gyroscope is attached to a crank arm so that the torque
      generated is perpendicular to the change in angle due to the
      buoyant wave force on the hull. The spinning gyro's angular
      velocity is electronically varied to change the precessional
      torque on the crank arm in order to adapt the device to different
      wave frequencies. In various tests conducted in the prototype,
      frictional and electrical losses were minimized by using low
      friction bearings for the gyro, matching the electric generator's
      impedance to the load, and using Schottky diodes for the
      rectifiers.<br>
      <br>
      In testing the prototype Gyro-Gen, a motion controlled test frame
      was built as a wave simulator to simulate the rocking motion of
      the device when floated on the ocean. The test frame includes a
      brushless torque motor and programmed to simulate [2/3] to
      4-second period ocean waves. An 8-channel data recorder
      (Persistor, Inc. CF2) was mounted on the test frame to record 20
      samples per second electrical output power and output of a 3-axis
      accelerometer (Crossbow CXL04LP3) mounted below the crank arm
      shaft. Data analysis software was written using Matlab.<br>
      <br>
      The Gyro-Gen was tested with varying wave periods, fixing tilt,
      electrical load, gyro rate, and crank arm offset to obtain
      measures of the output power as a function of the angular
      velocity. The gyro spinning rate was varied by 20 r.p.s. between
      successive runs. Before each run, the gyro was spun up by applying
      a constant voltage to the gyro motor from a lab power supply
      (Tektronix PS280). The gyro spinning rate was determined using the
      back e.m.f. frequency of the gyro motor recorded with a Tektronix
      THS 730A digital storage oscilloscope. The load impedance was
      measured with the Fluke 87 DMM. The electrical generator's load
      impedance was set to 100 ohms. During the run wave frequencies
      were held constant for 30 seconds before stepping in 0.25 Hz.
      increments until the maximum frequency of 1.5 Hz was reached. Then
      the wave frequency was stepped down in 0.25 Hz increments until
      the minimum of 0.25 Hz. was reached marking the end of the run.
      Each run was performed 3 times.<br>
      <br>
      Measurements of the generated power as a function of the
      electrical load were also obtained by decreasing the load
      impedance from the initial value of 100 ohms to 50 ohms and 33
      ohms and gyro angular velocities set to 65 and 90 r.p.s.<br>
      <br>
      A Maximum Load Test was conducted (at the previous range of wave
      frequencies and gyro rates) in which the load was increased using
      a 100 watt Ohmite rheostat until the crank arm stopped rotating
      synchronously, then decreased just enough to restore synchronous
      rotation. Under this condition, the voltage generated and the
      final load impedance were recorded using an averaging D.M.M. Then
      the power was calculated to determine the maximum power the system
      could generate at a specific gyro rate and a specific wave
      frequency.<br>
      <br>
      Another bench test, Self-Powered Gyro Test, was conducted with the
      Gyro-Gen&nbsp; operating autonomously by using the generated power
      to spin the gyroscope. The gyro was initially spun by the bench
      power supply at 80 r.p.s. The gyro motor was then switched to the
      electric generator, which was also loaded with 100 ohms and driven
      by the test frame at 1.5 Hz wave frequencies until the gyro rate
      was stabilized. The wave frequency was decreased to 1.25 Hz and
      the gyro's angular velocity was again allowed to stabilize.<br>
      <br>
      FIGS. 7A, 7B, 8A, 8B, and 9 show power measurements of the
      prototype Gyro-Gen with the test frame. FIG. 7A shows the power
      measurements as a function of the angular velocity of the
      gyroscope. According to the measurements, when the gyro rate was
      set to zero, the crank arm failed to make a complete revolution
      and to synchronize with the wave period simulated by the test
      frame. When the gyro's angular velocity was increased to 20 r.p.s.
      the crank arm began to move, but only made partial revolutions at
      1.25 and 1.5 Hz waves and did not resonate. When the gyro's rate
      was increased to 40 r.p.s. and the wave frequency step was 1.0 Hz,
      the crank arm started to make continuous revolutions and became
      phase-locked with the wave motion. The generator made continuous
      revolutions at 1.0, 1.25, and 1.5 Hz waves. At 65 r.p.s. the
      Gyro-Gen synchronized at all frequencies except 0.25 Hz; at 90
      r.p.s., the crank arm phase locked at all wave frequencies. The
      data indicates that there is a direct relationship between the
      gyro rate and the ability of the generator to output power.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 7B shows calculated theoretical power using the same
      parameters as tested for the&nbsp; prototype Gyro-Gen. The
      calculated results are consistent with the measured results after
      the losses are accounted for.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 8A shows power measurements as a function of the load. When
      the gyroscope was spinning at both 65 and 90 r.p.s., the increase
      in load, though dropping the voltage, increased the power output.
      When the load was increased to 33 ohms, the power output increased
      for all wave frequencies except 0.5 and 0.25. Results show that
      there is an optimal electrical impedance that should be matched to
      the mechanical impedance. This optimal electrical impedance can be
      determined by the gyro rate, the buoyant force and the wave
      frequency. To test this, a maximum load test was conducted and
      FIG. 8B shows the results. Comparing data in FIG. 7A to the same
      test conducted at "maximum load" in FIG. 8B, the power generated
      was substantially increased. For example, at a 90 r.p.s. gyro rate
      with a 1.25 Hz wave frequency, the power output at a fixed load of
      100 ohms was less than 0.7 watts, whereas at "maximum load" of 6.3
      ohms, the output was 3.0 watts, greater than a 400 percent
      increase in power. Similar large increases were observed at all
      gyro rates above 20 r.p.s. At a wave frequency of 1.25 Hz, the
      power levels off as the load approaches the source impedance of
      the generator. The 1.5 Hz frequency was not recorded because the
      output power went beyond the range of the stepper motor generator.
      These results indicate that for the practical
      wave-powered-generator, a controllable gyro rate and electrical
      load can be used to adapt to different wave frequencies to improve
      the conversion efficiency.<br>
      <br>
      The efficiency of the system can be estimated by dividing the net
      power (maximum power generated minus the gyro motor power) by the
      total power at maximum output and adding all measurable system
      losses. For example, at 90 r.p.s. and 1.25 Hz, the power output of
      gyro motor plus load was 2.98 watts. The gyro motor power was 2.16
      watts, so that the net output power was 0.817 watts. Adding the
      total losses, the diode bridge loss was 1.13 watts and the
      generator's internal resistance loss was 1.042 watts. The total
      measured power dissipation equals 5.122 watts. This compares well
      with the theoretical total power input of 6.17 watts. The
      corresponding efficiency is 0.817 watts/5.12 watts, or 16%. Using
      the theoretical power input instead of the measured power output
      the efficiency is 13%. Noting losses in the diode bridges, the
      rectifiers were replaced with Schottky diodes and efficiency
      increased to 18.4%.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 9 shows that after the initial rate of 80 r.p.s, driven at a
      wave frequency of 1.5 Hz, the gyro's angular velocity decreased,
      then stabilized, with the crank arm rotating synchronously, thus
      the generator was able to continuously power both the load and the
      gyro motor. When the wave frequency was stepped down to 1.25 Hz,
      the same results occurred. At 1.0 Hz the output was insufficient
      to sustain the gyro and the system eventually stopped. Results
      indicate that when the gyro motor was powered by the generator
      output, the system became self-sustaining, converting enough
      energy to maintain the gyro rotation while powering an auxiliary
      load.<br>
      <br>
      The above Gyro-Gen as mounted in a watertight (60.6 liter
      Rubbermaid Roughneck) utility tub to form a prototype based on the
      design in FIG. 5 for conducting sea tests. The utility tub was
      used as the housing 510 and was made watertight with a Plexiglas
      disk sealed with Teflon gasket. The Plexiglas disk was 0.56 cm
      thick and 54.6 cm in diameter. The buoy was ballasted with 3.4 kg
      dumbbell weights and 25.4 cm Unistrut(R) brackets in a radial keel
      configuration were installed on the utility tub to maximize wave
      power input to the hull. A data recorder was installed and
      acceleration and voltage recorded at 10 samples per second at
      constant gyro speed and electrical load. Measurements under
      various operating conditions are called "Runs" in this
      specification. For Run 1, four brackets were as keels, in Run 2
      one bracket was used along with the 3.4 kg weight, in Runs 3-7
      four bracket keels and 3.4 kg ballast were used. Gyro angles for
      Runs 3-7 ranged from 90 to 0 degrees in 30 degree increments used
      the standard settings of 10 cm crank arm.<br>
      <br>
      Ocean testing included seven test runs shown in FIG. 10. In the
      first three tests, the keel design and ballast were varied and the
      best results were observed with 4 Unistrut bracket keels and 3.4
      kilos (7.5 lb) ballast. This set up was kept throughout all
      remaining runs (FIG. 12). Run 3, with the standard settings of 10
      cm crank arm radius and 90 degree angle gyro, generated the most
      power of any sea tests. Run 7 (gyro angle at 0.0 degrees)
      generated the least power of the runs performed with the gyro on.
      Run 6 (gyro off) revealed far lower power output than any other
      run. For example, in Run 3, with the optimal keel design, the
      output was more than ten times greater with the gyro rotating than
      when stopped. The contrast in power output between runs with and
      without the gyro rotating suggests that precessional torque
      converts periodic wave energy into the rotary motion of the crank
      arm.<br>
      <br>
      The above test results demonstrate that power generation based on
      gyroscopic precession is a viable technology for an autonomous
      wave-powered generator. The prototype Gyro-Gen successfully
      generated sufficient power to run both the gyroscope and an
      auxiliary load. Hence, the gyroscope can be used to efficiently
      transfer power from periodic angular motion into electricity. The
      test results further show that the crank arm could generate little
      power without the gyro's precessional torque. As the angular
      momentum of the gyroscope increases, the amount of the potential
      torque to the generator and the electrical power output increase
      accordingly. Notably, the load can be controlled in order to
      achieve the maximum power output. Both experimental and
      theoretical results indicate that the electrical load and the
      angular momentum of the gyro are interrelated, i.e., if the
      angular momentum on the gyro is increased, it only helps to a
      certain point before the load must be increased. For instance, as
      indicated in FIG. 7A, the power output started to level off at 40
      r.p.s. for frequencies of 1.0 Hz and above, and at 60 to 65 r.p.s.
      for wave frequencies of 0.25 Hz to 0.75 Hz. In FIG. 8B, power
      outputs at all wave frequencies continued to increase with the
      gyro angular velocity. A maximum of 3.0 watts into a 6.3-ohm load
      was generated at a wave frequency of 1.25 Hz and a gyro rate of 90
      r.p.s. Efficiency calculations show that it is important to keep
      electrical and frictional losses as low as possible.<br>
      <br>
      Sea tests of the prototype Gyro-Gen show that a rotating gyro
      increased the power output significantly. The buoy design in FIG.
      5 was effective and efficient in converting the wave energy into
      electricity. In particular, the addition of the radial-blade keel
      and ballast configuration resulted in higher output. Independent
      sea-state data at the same time and location of the tests
      indicated the significant wave height was approximately 0.5 meter
      at a period of approximately 12 seconds. See, Coastal Data
      Information Program, Integrative Oceanography Division, Scripps

      Although the wave period was beyond the range of the prototype,
      the results still support the conclusion that gyroscopic
      precession increases power output.<br>
      <br>
      The present gyroscope-based generator may be implemented in a
      large scale to increase the power output. As an example, assume a
      gyroscope with a moment of inertia of about 30 [kg.m&lt;2&gt; ] is
      used. This is approximately equivalent to the moment of inertia of
      a 250 [kg] disk with a radius of 0.5 [m]) spinning at 200 [r.p.s].
      The angular momentum of this large gyroscope is approximately 3600
      [kg.m&lt;2&gt; .[omega]]. Thus a Gyro-Gen buoy containing a single
      gyroscope mechanism with the above large gyroscope can generate
      approximately 2340 Watts in little more than one cubic meter of
      space excluding the buoy hull assuming the buoy pitches at +-15
      degrees on a 10 second period wave. Therefore, depending on the
      power requirements, gyroscope-based generators may be sized to
      provide sufficient power outputs for different applications.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 11A further shows a block diagram of an exemplary
      gyroscope-based generator 1100 that implements a system controller
      1130 and a power regulator 1150. The power regulator 1150 is
      connected to receive generated electrical power from the
      electrical generator 130. A regulation signal 1152 is sent to the
      system controller 1130 to inform the system controller of the
      status of the regulator load. A gyro angular velocity sensor 1120
      is coupled to the gyro wheel of the gyroscope 110 to measure the
      angular velocity. The measured angular velocity is fed to the
      system controller 1130. In addition, one or more motion sensors
      1140 for measuring the pitch, roll, and heave parameters of the
      whole system caused by the periodic or oscillating torque that
      acts on the gyroscope 110 and possibly the transmission 120. The
      measurements from the one or more sensors 1140 are sent to the
      system controller 1130.<br>
      <br>
      The system controller 1130 processes the measurements from the
      sensors 1120 and 1140 and the load information from the power
      regulator 1150 and dynamically controls the angular velocity of
      the gyroscope 110 by producing a gyro motor velocity control
      signal. A gyro motor velocity control unit 1110 is provided to
      respond to the control signal and to control the gyro motor 418
      accordingly. The gyro motor 418, in turn, drives the gyroscope 110
      at a desired gyro angular velocity. Hence, this control feedback
      is dynamic in the sense that the gyro angular velocity is adjusted
      with changes in the external periodic torque and the load. The
      power regulator 1150 splits the power from the generator 130 into
      a first portion as the output for distribution, e.g., driving an
      electronic device or an electrical appliance, and a second portion
      to a storage battery 1160. The storage battery may be used as the
      power supply for the gyro motor 418.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 11B shows another implementation based on the design in FIG.
      11A where a crank arm angle sensor is used to measure the angle of
      the crank arm and feeds the angle measurement to the system
      controller 1130. The system controller 1130 can process and use
      this information, in addition to other information (e.g., gyro
      angular velocity and the buoy motion parameters), to control the
      velocity of the gyro motor and thus the spinning speed of the
      gyroscope.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 12 shows an exemplary operation of the system controller 1130
      in the device 1100 as a buoyant system. First, the system is
      initialized at step 1210 to, e.g., power up the gyroscope and
      check communications with different parts of the systems such as
      the sensors. At step 1220, the attitude measurements from the
      sensors 1140 are acquired by the system controller 1130. At step
      1230, the buoy dynamics is computed to determine the power input
      from the external periodic torque. The system controller 1130 sets
      the initial gyro angular velocity and power output regulator to
      match the power input. This is the step 1240. At this time, the
      generator 130 begins to generate electricity (step 1250). The
      system controller 1130 further acquires attitude measurements from
      sensors 1140 to extract the buoy pitch and roll angles (step 1260
      and 1270). At step 1280, the system controller 1130 determines
      whether the pitch, roll, and crank arm precession angle are in
      phase with each other. The regulator load is adjusted to increase
      or decrease in order to maintain the phase between the pitch,
      roll, and crank arm precession angle. If the pitch and roll are
      not synchronized, the system initialization and subsequent steps
      are performed get the system back to the "normal" operation.<br>
      <br>
      In the above examples, only a single gyroscope is used in a
      gyroscope-based generator. In other implementations, two or more
      gyroscopes may be used in a generator to achieve certain operating
      advantages. FIG. 13 shows one example of a gyroscope-based
      generator 1300 where two gyroscopes 1310 and 1320 are used. The
      first gyroscope 1310 is fixed to a transmission gear 1312 which
      may be a circular plate or a cylinder with a geared edge. The
      precession of the gyroscope 1310 causes the transmission gear 1312
      to rotate with the precession. Similarly, the second gyroscope
      1320 is fixed to a second transmission gear 1322 which may be a
      circular plate or a cylinder with a geared edge. The precession of
      the gyroscope 1320 causes the transmission gear 1322 to rotate
      with the precession. The two transmission gears 1312 and 1322 are
      engaged at their geared edges to rotate in opposite directions and
      are synchronized with each other. Two electric motor-generators
      1316 and 1326 are respectively engaged to the transmission gears
      1312 and 1322 and are driven to produce electricity. As
      illustrated, gears 1314 and 1324 are used to engage the
      transmission gears 1312 and 1322 to the rotary motor-generators
      1316 and 1326, respectively. The control mechanism described in
      FIGS. 11 and 12 may be applied to the dual-gyroscope generator
      1300. A common base 1301 is used to support both gyroscopes and to
      cause both gyroscopes to react to the same oscillating motion.<br>
      <br>
      In summary, only a few implementations are disclosed. However, it
      is understood that variations and enhancements may be made.<br>
