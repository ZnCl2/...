      Mirko Beljanski (1923–1998) was a French-Serbian molecular
      biologist, and the founder of the Beljanski Foundation, a
      nonprofit organization focused on researching beneficial plant
      extracts for the treatment of cancer.[1] His later work on HIV and
      cancer was controversial.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Career</b><br>
      <br>
      Beljanski was born in 1923 in Yugoslavia. He came to France to
      study, and lived there for the rest of his life.[2] He was married
      to Monique.[3] He received a PhD in 1948 from the University of
      Paris.[2] In 1948, he entered the CNRS and worked at the Pasteur
      Institute in Paris as a researcher in molecular biology.[4] He
      made several discoveries while studying RNA and DNA. Beljanski was
      made to leave the Pasteur Institute in 1978, after pursuing
      research against the advice of the institute, but still continued
      to publish scientific papers.[2] He was at the Faculty of Pharmacy
      of Châtenay-Malabry until his retirement in 1988.[2]<br>
      <br>
      In his lifetime, Beljanski published a total of 133 scientific
      papers,[5] mostly written in French.[6] After his retirement he
      worked for another ten years in a private laboratory. During that
      time, he developed natural products that are said to inhibit the
      growth of cancer cells {The anticancer agent PB-100, selectively
      active on malignant cell lines, even multidrug resistant. Genetic
      and Molecular Biology 23, 1, 29-33 (2000), (Anti-prostate cancer
      activity of a ß-carboline alkaloid enriched extract from Rauwolfia
      vomitoria: International Journal of Oncology 29: 1065-1073, 2006),
      (Carboline Alkaloid–Enriched Extract from the Amazonian Rain
      Forest Tree Pao Pereira Suppresses Prostate Cancer Cells: Journal
      of the Society for Integrative Oncology, Spring 2009, Volume 7,
      Number 2), (Two Herbal Extracts for Protecting Prostate Cell DNA:
      Integrative Medicine, Vol. 9, No 2, Apr/Mat 2010). He also
      developed a preparation of RNA fragments that was claimed to
      promote the production of white blood cells and platelets (Dose
      escalation study of an antithrombocytopenic agent in patients with
      chemotherapy induced thrombocytopenia. Levin et al. BMC Cancer
      2010, 10:565).<br>
      <br>
      Beljanski believed he had found antivirals effective against
      cancer and AIDS.[4] A product made from extracts of the Brazilian
      paopereira tree[2] and called PB100 was claimed to be superior to
      AZT, which Beljanksi called "real poison".[3] Customers included
      François Mitterrand (via a homeopath called Philippe de
      Kuyper).[2][3] The French Department of Health accused him of
      illegally practising medicine in 1991, and he was sentenced in
      March 1994.[4]<br>
      <br>
      <b>Beljanski Foundation</b><br>
      <br>
      The Beljanski foundation and CIRIS,[7] French not-for-profit
      organizations work together to promote knowledge about Mirko
      Beljanski's research. They also provided financial support for
      ongoing research both preclinical and clinical.[8][9]<br>

      <div align="center"><big><b>The Beljanski Approach</b></big><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Mirko Beljanski, PhD, (1923-1998), biochemist and biologist, spent
      his professional career at the Pasteur Institute in Paris,
      studying the causes and mechanisms occurring during gene
      activation, cell division and tissue development in both normal
      and malignant states. His book, “The Regulation of DNA Replication
      &amp; Transcription,” is devoted to this critical subject.<br>
      <br>
      Dr. Beljanski discovered a change in the conformation of the DNA
      of a cell when in the presence of carcinogens (mutagens or other),
      pollutants, or other harmful molecules. He showed that the DNA of
      a cancer cell becomes unwound or destabilized, a finding that was
      recently confirmed in the United States. These results led him to
      invent the Oncotest, which allowed him to identify many molecules
      with carcinogenic potential. The Oncotest also permitted Dr.
      Beljanski to discover two specific anticancer plant extracts. John
      Hall, PhD, discusses this test and more about the ideas of Dr.
      Beljanski in the Townsend Letter article, “Destabilization of the
      DNA Double Helix in Cancer, Mirko Beljanski’s Theory of
      Carcinogenesis and Anti-Cancer Extracts”.<br>
      <br>
      Monique Beljanski, widow and colleague of Dr. Mirko Belanski,
      summarizes different steps of this work in an article also
      published in the Townsend Letter, “The Beljanski Approach: Outside
      the Box”.<br>
      <br>
      Dr. Beljanski made many more exciting discoveries and published
      many of his works. He was also one of the first biologists to
      study small RNA, which plays an important role in the growth of a
      cell. Certain RNA fragments stimulate the formation of white blood
      cells and platelets. They not only maintain normal white blood
      cell and platelet levels during radiation and chemotherapy, but
      they also preserve normal proportions among the various kinds of
      white blood cells, notably those that fight infections. These RNA
      fragments promote only the DNA of healthy cells, never that of
      cancer cells.<br>
      <br>
      After 20 years of successful use in Europe, the Beljanski®
      products were brought to the US and can now be obtained from
      Natural Source International, Ltd.<br>
      <br>
      At Columbia University, Dr. Aaron Katz’s team conducted more
      research on the efficacy of the plant extracts in the Beljanski®
      products, Rauwolfia vomitoria and Pao pereira (Pau pereira). Dr.
      Aaron Katz, MD and Debra Bemis, PhD have explored and confirmed
      the Rauwolfia vomitoria extract as an anti-cancer element and
      shortly thereafter have also explored and confirmed the Pao
      pereira as a selective anticancer extract.<br>
      <br>
      A clinical trial to test the synergistic effects of Rauwolfia
      vomitoria and Pao pereira (Pau pereira) on men with a negative
      biopsy and elevated PSA was recently executed at the Columbia
      University, Department of Holistic Urology, under the direction of
      Dr. Geovanni Espinosa. The trial has now been completed and we
      await the final statistical results.<br>

      In the article “A Novel Combination of Plant Extracts with
      Promising Anti-Prostate Cancer Activity”, John Hall, PhD, Natacha
      Springer, Msc, and Debra Bemis, PhD explain and discuss the
      anticancer activity of Pao pereira and Rauwolfia vomitoria.<br>
      <br>
      The prestigious publication, IMCJ (Integrative Medicine: A
      clinician’s journal) also published an article in their April-May
      2010 issue titled, “Two Herbal Extracts for Protecting Prostate
      Cell DNA”<br>
      <br>
      The Cancer Treatment Centers of America, who have just completed a
      clinical trial on the extraordinary Beljanski formula of RNA
      fragments, which are active during the synthesis of immune cells,
      published the results in the online magazine Bio Med Central under
      the following title: “Dose escalation study of an
      antithrobacytopenic agent in patients with chemotherapy induced
      thrombocytopenia”.<br>
      <br>
      Moreover, several doctors and journalists were interested in
      promoting Mirko Beljanski’s work:<br>
      <br>
      Michael Schachter, MD, of the Schachter Center for Complementary
      Medicine in Suffern, NY, has also taken an interest in the
      research of Dr. Beljanski and the Beljanski® products. Typically,
      he recommends the products as a complementary treatment for people
      fighting cancer. Read what Dr. Schachter says about Dr.
      Beljanski’s approach to combating serious afflictions.<br>
      <br>
      In the Townsend Letter article “Symptoms Elimination for Prostate
      Disease”, Dr. Morton Walker explores the positive effects of
      Rauwolfia vomitoria and Pao pereira (Pau pereira), and the current
      research taking place in America with these extracts.<br>
      <br>
      David Steinman, Publisher and Editor of The Doctor’s Prescription
      for Healthy Living magazine, recognized Dr. Mirko Beljanski as a
      green patriot. Dr. Beljanski’s research, specifically how
      chemicals and cancer are related, is important to the modern
      environmental movement. More information about the Beljanski®
      products, Prostabel® and Ladybel® is available thanks to Healthy
      Living magazine.<br>

      David Steinman has also spearheaded the publication of a book
      about the life and research of Mirko Beljanski titled

      the World’s First Green Molecular Biologist Can Restore Your
      Health” by L. Stephen Coles, MD, PhD. Dr. Coles is the co-founder

      Flavopereirine taken alone may act as an effective active agent in
      the struggle against HIV viruses in mammals, including humans.
      More specifically, it has been found that <b>flavopereirine</b>
      is an active agent which on its own, whether in vitro or in vivo
      exerts a selective inhibitlye action on viral HIV infection,
      particularly in patients infected by HIV-1. Thus, there is
      provided a method for the treatment of human immunodeficiency
      virus comprising administering to a human patient infected with
      human immunodeficiency virus an effective antiviral amount of a
      composition consisting of flavopereirine or a pharmaceutically
      acceptable salt or derivative thereof and a pharmaceutically
      acceptable carrier. The flavopereirine, or one of its salts or
      other acceptable pharmaceutical derivatives, is preferably
      administered in solid form containing approximately 250-500 mg of
      flavopereirine per dose.<br>
      <b><br>
      </b><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      <div align="center"><img alt="" src="us5d.jpg" width="369"
          height="259"><br>

      This invention relates to the antiviral usage of flavopereirine.
      More specifically, it relates to a pharmaceutical preparation
      whose sole active ingredient is flavopereirine, and to the use of
      this preparation for the treatment of viral infections in
      human--in particular, infections such as those provoked by the
      Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV).<br>
      <br>
      Flavopereirine is an alkaloid of the beta-carboline class. It is
      also traditionally referred to as "H or PB 100 composition," and
      shows UV emission fluorescence at 250-254 and 306 nm.<br>
      <br>
      Flavopereirine may be obtained from the peel of the Pao Pereira
      Geissospermum vellosii-Baillon Apocynaceae (see H. Rapaport et
      al., J. Amer. Chem. Soc. 80:1601-1608 (1958) and Beljanski et al.,
      request for first certificate of addition #79 05853 to French
      patent application #78 07155 and EP-A-0 059 817.).<br>
      <br>
      It is known that flavopereirine, administered intracutaneously at
      a dosage of 200-600 .mu.g or a dosage of 2.5-500 mg/day,
      preferably 30 mg/day, prevents the appearance and development of
      vital papules in the case of viruses of the Shope fibrome type and
      of vaccine.<br>
      <br>
      It is also known that flavopereirine appears to act in vivo
      against influenza (RNA virus), and that it may moreover inhibit
      the multiplication of the tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) after brief
      contact with this virus.<br>
      <br>
      European Patent Application EP-A-0 059 817 reveals that
      flavopereirine is active against the influenza virus; however, the
      half-life of a quaternary beta-carboline of this type is too short
      for efficient use in humans in a galenic form other than
      time-release capsules.<br>
      <br>
      French Patent Application No. 88 15845 describes a system for
      improving immune defense in humans (against RNA viruses--AIDS in
      particular--and DNA viruses). According to this document, the
      inhibition of the multiplication of the viruses in question is
      possible only by a combination of four different substances, of
      which flavopereirine is only one. The pharmaceutical preparation
      revealed in the document must include at least one representative
      of each of these four categories of active substances. The
      flavopereirine included in this combination is administered at a
      dosage of 0.25 g/day, preferably orally.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      It has now unexpectedly been discovered that flavopereirine taken
      alone may act as an effective active agent in the struggle against
      HIV viruses in mammals, including humans. More specifically, it
      has been found that flavopereirine is an active agent which on its
      own, whether in vitro or in vivo exerts a selective inhibitive
      action on viral HIV infection, particularly in patients infected
      by HIV-1. Thus, in accordance with the present invention there is
      provided a method for the treatment of human immunodeficiency
      virus comprising administering to a human patient infected with
      human immunodeficiency virus an effective antiviral amount of a
      composition consisting of flavopereirine or a pharmaceutically
      acceptable salt or derivative thereof and a pharmaceutically
      acceptable carrier. The flavopereirine, or one of its salts or
      other acceptable pharmaceutical derivatives, is preferably
      administered in solid form containing approximately 250-500 mg of
      flavopereirine per dose.<br>
      <br>
      It is also an object of the present invention to provide a method
      of using a pharmaceutical preparation based on flavopereirine in
      order to provide an antiviral treatment for HIV.<br>
      <br>
      A further aspect of the present invention is an article of
      manufacture comprising a packaging material and a pharmaceutical
      agent contained within said packaging material, wherein said
      pharmaceutical agent contains flavopereirine as the sole active
      ingredient, and wherein said packaging material comprises a label
      which indicates that the pharmaceutical agent can be used for
      treatment of human immunodeficiency virus.<br>

      <b> </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      Flavopereirine has the chemical formula ##STR1## For use in the
      present invention, flavopereirine may be prepared by the
      hydrolysis in 1N HCl of Geissospermum vellosii powder at 100 DEG
      C., followed by neutralization by KOH, extraction by ethanol and
      concentration by distillation. The residue of the distillation is
      subsequently taken up in chloroform, the excess salt is eliminated
      by precipitation with cold ethanol, and the residue, which
      contains mainly flavopereirine is concentrated. For purposes of
      the present invention, the flavopereirine may be used as produced
      by this process, or can be converted to a pharmaceutically
      acceptable salt or other derivative.<br>
      <br>
      In accordance with the invention, flavopereirine is administered
      orally in the forms of capsules to patients infected with HIV at
      levels of 1-3 grams per day. At this level, flavopereirine is
      devoid of toxic or side effects in mammals, including humans.
      Indeed, the LD50 in Sprague-Dawley EOPS rats is 10.45 g/kg (safety
      limits: 9.63-11.35) when administered orally, and 2.45 g/kg
      (safety limits: 2.35-2.55) when administered intraperitoneally. In
      determining these values, when the animal died, it died within 30
      to 60 minutes of oral or intraperitoneal administration by
      respiratory arrest. No change in mortality rate was observed
      during the subsequent 14 days in surviving animals.<br>
      <br>
      Sub-chronic administration in male and female Sprague-Dawley rats
      (OPA) demonstrated the absence of toxicity in doses equal to 1/20
      of the LD50 (viz. 530 mg/kg/day), or of 1/5 of the LD50 (viz. 2120
      mg/kg/day). At these doses, no alterations were noted in either
      body weight or feeding. Neither was any alteration in the globular
      blood count noted, and a hepatic and renal functions remained
      normal. No lesions of the liver, kidneys, duodenum, myocardia,
      spleen, thyroid and parathyroid glands, testicles or ovaries were
      visible by microscope.<br>
      <br>
      Flavopereirine was observed to penetrate the blood-brain barrier,
      as shown by the fact that in male CDI mice which received 10 mg of
      the flavopereirine preparation orally, the encephalic
      flavopereirine content was approximately 7 .mu.g (i.e., a
      concentration of 14 .mu.g/g, from 20 g mice with brains weighing
      0.5 g.).<br>
      <br>
      The effectiveness of flavopereirine in the present invention will
      now be demonstrated by the following non-limiting examples.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 1</b><br>
      <br>
      The destruction of HIV by flavopereirine in in vitro cell cultures
      without effect on normal or healthy cells was demonstrated using
      the H-9 colony of T4 lymphocytes obtained from Dr. R. Gallo via
      the Paul Ehrlich Institute (Frankfurt, Germany) and propagated by
      the Institut fur Medizinische Mikrobiologie und Hygiene
      (University of Bern, Switzerland).<br>
      <br>
      HIV was obtained as HTLV-III from Dr. Gallo and propagated in the
      H-9 cells. The surface material produced by the infected H-9 cell
      culture was stored at -80 DEG C. This material had a concentration
      of 10@6 IU/ml at the point of use. The H-9 cells were cultivated
      in an RPMI 1640 medium containing 15% fetal calf serum, 0.002
      .mu.m glutamine and 100 IU penicillin/ml in Falcon flasks (25
      cm@3). 8 to 20 ml of the medium was used per vial. The vials were
      incubated at 37 DEG C. in an upright position. The culture was
      initiated at a concentration of 2.times.10@5 H-9 cells per ml, and
      divided when the number of cells reached 1.times.10@6 cells/mi. In
      order to test the flavopereirine in cultures of both infected and
      non-infected H-9 cells, microtitration plates were used. In these
      cases, the cultures were begun at a concentration of 6.times.10@5
      H-9 cells/mi. After 23 hours incubation, 0.1 ml RPMI 1640 medium
      containing 10@2 IU of HIV was added to each well containing 0.1 ml
      of this cellular suspension. This corresponds to an infection
      multiplication of 1.6.times.10@4, i.e., one infectious unit per
      500 cells. 16 hours after infection, 0.1 ml of RPMI 1640 medium,
      with or without flavopereirine, was added to the infected and
      non-infected wells. The flavopereirine was used at a concentration
      of 30 .mu.g/ml and 60 .mu.g/ml. The microtitration plates were
      covered with an Amersham plate cover, and incubated at 37 DEG C.
      Cellular counts were determined using an HIV antigen kit provided
      by Abbott Laboratories. For purposes of titration, a volume of 10
      .mu.l (taken from each of the wells of the microtitration plate)
      was diluted in 1 ml of RPMI 1640 medium. Based on this stock, 8
      dilutions were made in respective series of 1 to 3 and 1 to 5. A
      volume of 0.1 ml of each dilution was removed and added to 0.2 ml
      of pre-incubated culture of H-9 cells containing 5.times.10@5
      cells/mi. After incubation at 37 DEG C., the presence of HIV
      antigens was tested using an HIV antigen kit provided by Abbott
      Laboratories.<br>
      <br>
      The results, which are reproduced in graphic form in the attached
      FIG. 1, show that flavopereirine does not affect the
      multiplication of non-infected cells. By contrast, the quantity of
      infected cells is around 40% lower when the flavopereirine is
      present.<br>
      <br>
      What was even more striking (as shown in the presentation of
      results in FIG. 2) was that, although there was an increase in
      viral particles of untreated infected cells over time, it was not
      possible, within the limitations of this particular test, to
      detect the presence of infectious units above 3000 in the series
      of infected cells treated with flavopereirine (30 .mu.g or 60
      .mu.g). This shows that the inhibition of infection exceeds 99% at
      the very least.<br>
      <b><br>
      </b><b>EXAMPLE 2</b><br>
      <br>
      An evaluation of the antiviral effect of flavopereirine was also
      undertaken by studying the cytopathogenic effect of the HIV virus
      on MT4 cells, given that a formation of syncytia was observed 4-6
      days after infection by HIV-1, followed by the death of the cells.<br>
      <br>
      The flavopereirine was used in the form of an alcoholic solution
      (40 mg in 100 .mu.l alcohol). Dilutions were made in RPMI medium
      at 10% of FCS, 1% of PSN and 1% of glutamine. The MT4 cells were
      left to pre-incubate for two hours at 37 DEG C. with a successive
      dilution of flavopereirine containing 3.times.10@5 cells for 10
      .mu.l of flavopereirine solution. The solution was obtained by
      adding 100 .mu.l of a 10@-4 dilution of HIV-1 virus, producing a
      syncytia formation in 4-6 days. After one hour of incubation at 37
      DEG C., the infected MT4 cells were washed three times with RPMI
      solution before being placed in culture (3.times.10@5 cells/ml in
      microplates with 24 wells) with the presence of different
      dilutions of flavopereirine. The syncytia count was taken each day
      in duplicate. The results are summarized in tables I, II and III
      below.<br>
      <br>
      Table I shows cellular toxicity for 100 and 400 .mu.g/ml
      flavopereirine. At 50 .mu.g/ml syncytia had not formed after 7
      days culture. From 10 .mu.g/ml to 100 ng/ml, syncytia was
      observed, as it was in the HIV-1 control,<br>
      <br>
      Table II confirms the protection obtained by flavopereirine at 50
      .mu.g/ml, and Table III reconfirms these results: no syncytia were
      formed at 60 .mu.g/ml after 7 days culture, while a few were
      observed after 6 days at the dosage 30 .mu.g/ml.<br>

      <b>EXAMPLE 3</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      To test the efficacy of flavopereirine on the infectious
      capability of HIV-1, two experiments were conducted. In the basic
      methodology of each experiment, 1 nanogram of primary isolates of
      HIV-1, BRE1 (from an asymptomatic patient) and TIG2 (from an AIDS
      patient) were inoculated with 10@6 peripheral blood mononuclear
      cells (PBMC) stimulated with PHA taken from five randomly-chosen
      HIV-negative donors. After 2 hours of incubation, the cells were
      rinsed twice and cultivated in 1 ml of RPMI 1640 containing 20 IU
      of IL-2 per ml (Boehringer Mannhelm, Germany), 2 .mu.g of
      Polybrene (hexadimethrine bromide) per ml (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo.,
      USA) and 10@-7 IU of goat antiserum acting against human alpha
      interferon (Janssen, Beerse, Belgium) per ml. Half the culture was
      changed after 72 hours, and thereafter every 48 hours until the
      30th day.<br>
      <br>
      For the first experiment, prior to incubation of the virus in PBMC
      stimulated by PHA (blast cells), extracellular viral stocks were
      pretreated in triplicate with 30 or 60 .mu.g flavopereirine per ml
      for two hours. In the second experiment, blast cells were
      pretreated in triplicate with 30 or 60 .mu.g flavopereirine per ml
      for two hours, and were then rinsed twice before exposure to the
      viral inoculum.<br>
      <br>
      The surface material of the culture was tested by an
      immuno-enzymatic (ELISA) assay for the production of antigen P24
      (Abbott, Chicago, Ill., USA) and the optical density (OD) of the
      resulting color was converted into P24 concentration from the
      slope of a standard nomogram, as described by W. Lu and J. -M.
      Andrieu, Journal of Virology, 66(1): 334-340 (1992). The result of
      the two experiments are shown in Tables IV and V, respectively. As
      shown, a pretreatment of HIV-1 by flavopereirine (compound H) at a
      level of 30 or 60 .mu.g/ml completely prevented the infection of
      target PBMC by primary HIV-1 isolates taken from both symptomatic
      and asymptomatic patients. On the other hand, only pretreatment of
      target PBMC with 60 .mu.g/ml led to complete inhibition of
      productive viral infections.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 4</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      To evaluate the cytotoxicity of flavopereirine in resting PBMC and
      in blast cells, prewashed fresh and blastic PBMC taken from five
      randomly-selected, healthy, HIV-negative donors were treated in
      triplicate with 30 or 60 .mu.g flavopereirine per ml of alcoholic
      solution for two hours, After washing twice, the cells were placed
      in culture in cellular culture medium until day 15. The viability
      of the cells of each group was examined by exclusion coloring with
      trypan blue and by quantimetric analysis. Cultures of HIV-negative
      PBMC without flavopereirine (compound H) were used as controls.
      The results are summarized in Table VI. As shown, the viability of
      resting PBMC was reduced significantly (p&lt;0.05) in the group of
      cells treated with 60 .mu.g/ml, but this was not the case in the
      group treated with 30 .mu.g of compound H per ml. Viability of the
      blastic cells appeared to be independent of exposure to compound
      H.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 5</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      To further test the inhibition of productive infection by HIV-1
      through use of flavopereirine, HIV-1 was pretreated with
      flavopereirine (compound H) in doses of 10, 30, 60, 100, 200
      .mu.g/ml and then combined with PBMC. Flavopereirine was found to
      inhibit infection of target PBMC by the virus in a manner
      dependent on the dose (see Table VII below). Doses equal to or
      higher than 60 .mu.g of compound H per ml appeared to represent
      the required concentration for complete inhibition of productive
      viral infections.<br>
      <br>
      This experiment was repeated, but prior to the pretreatment the
      virus was combined with human serum. In the primary human PBMC
      culture system, the efficacy of flavopereirine (compound H) on the
      inhibition of wild HIV-1 remained unchanged when the medicine was
      placed for incubation in a culture medium containing 50% human
      serum before the inhibition experiment. (See Table VIII).<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 6</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The cytotoxicity of flavopereirine (compound H) in human PBMC
      stimulated with PHA was tested in the presence and absence of
      human AB serum as shown in Table IX. These tests showed that the
      viability of blast PBMC diminished significantly (p&lt;0.001) in
      the group of cells treated with 200 .mu.g/ml, but this was not the
      case in the groups treated with 100, 60, 30 and 10 .mu.g/ml
      compound H respectively. Thus, the replication of HIV-1 can be
      totally inhibited by a concentration of flavopereirine (60-100
      .mu.g/ml) that is 2 to 4 times weaker than the cytotoxic
      concentrations. This effect did not appear to be influenced by the
      constituents of the human serum.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 7</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The effects of flavopereirine on the production of primary
      (IL-1.beta. and TNF-.alpha.) and secondary (IL-6) cytokines by
      monocytes was also tested. The adhesive monocytes used were taken
      from the blood of two types of donors:<br>
      Normal donors--voluntary blood donors who attended the blood bank
      of the Pitie-Salpetriere Hospital, Paris, France; and<br>
      HIV-positive donors from medical consultations. These individuals
      were in the early stages of HIV infection and, at the moment of
      taking the blood, were not undergoing any treatment. The risk
      factors involved were intravenous drug abuse for six of the
      donors, sexual transmission for three and blood transfusion (in
      Zaire) for one patient. No correlation was found between the risk
      factors and the results of the experiments.<br>
      <br>
      In the case of the HIV-positive donors, a number of anomalies were
      found; these related mainly to the polynuclear and lymphocytic
      lines;<br>
      Hypersegmented or hyposegmented (Pelger type) polynuclears in four
      cases out of 10.<br>
      Hyperbasophilic lymphocytes were also found in four cases out of
      10 (not the same cases as the above). No correlation was found
      between these anomalies and the results obtained in the
      experiments.<br>
      <br>
      In immunophenotypical analysis, no expression of the
      differentiation antigens (CD34, CD33, CD13 and CD11b) examined was
      found deficient.<br>
      <br>
      <b>I. Normal donors</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The ten donors in these experiments showed a considerable
      coherence of results;<br>
      No spontaneous production of either primary cytokines (IL-I.beta.
      and TNF-.alpha.) or of interleukin-6, a secondary cytokine;<br>
      The stimulation of monocytes over a period of 48 hours with
      interferon (1000 U/ml) did not cause any production of primary
      cytokines, except in donor #10 in 1L-1.beta., or of secondary
      cytokine, except for donors #1 and 5.<br>
      As expected, the stimulations obtained with LPS
      (lipopolysaccharide) and the combination interferon-.gamma.+LPS
      they varied in amplitude from donor to donor; they were always
      significant, with a synergic effect in the case of double
      stimulation.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Effect of product H</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Product H was not used in these experiments at a rate of more than
      20 .mu.g/ml water, since above this rate, net toxicity could have
      been produced. Four donors were previously tested with 30, 50, 100
      .mu.g/ml with virtually total cytotoxicity: above 40% at 30
      .mu.g/ml, and 100 .mu.g/ml above that rate (analysis of the
      culture surface material was not prepared).<br>
      <br>
      The doses of 5, 10 and 20 .mu.g/ml were chosen from the second
      series of experiments onwards, after the results from the first
      two donors had shown that doses of less than 5 .mu.g/ml proved
      inactive.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Direct activity of product H</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      On the production of primary cytokines:<br>
      * Increase in the production of TNF-.alpha. (donor 7), in one dose
      only; this effect was also detected in the response to
      IFN-.gamma..<br>
      * Increase in the production of IL-1.beta. (donors #3, 5 and 6)
      with a dose effect, though this was marginal. Donor #10, however,
      responded very well to doses of 10 and 20 .mu.g/ml.<br>
      <br>
      On the production of secondary cytokine (interleukin-6):<br>
      * No modification in response was observed.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Indirect Activity of product H</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      On the production of primary cytokines:<br>
      * Production of TNF-.alpha.: There was a sharp reduction in
      production, but solely in the case of a heavy dosage of the
      product (20 .beta.g/ml) (p&lt;0.05).<br>
      * Production of IL-1.beta.: there was no significant modification
      of the responses to LPS or to IFN-.gamma.+LPS (p&lt;0.05).<br>
      <br>
      On the production of secondary cytokine (interleukin-6):<br>
      * There was a sharp reduction in the production of IL-6; this
      inhibition was never total, and, contrary to the case of
      TNF-.alpha., it was dose-dependent (P&lt;0.05).<br>
      These different results are organized in diagrams 3 and 4, in
      which the measured doses are shown in .mu.g/ml of cytokines, and
      the standard deviations are not precise, since these are always
      10% less than the average.<br>
      <br>
      <b>II. HIV-positive donors</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The response of the monocytes taken from the various HIV-positive
      donors was tested in terms of spontaneous response. The quantities
      of cells received were low (the donors were not affected by
      cytapheresy), and the experiments were therefore limited by the
      number of cells available.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Direct activity of product H</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      On the production of primary cytokines.<br>
      No modification on the base production was observed, whether for
      TNF-.alpha. or for IL-1.beta..<br>
      <br>
      On the production of secondary cytokine.<br>
      8 out of 10 donors showed a significant spontaneous response in
      interleukin-6.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Indirect activity of product H</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Effect on the production of primary cytokines.<br>
      The effects obtained were the same as those for healthy donors,
      namely an almost total reduction in the production of TNF-.alpha.
      (only at a dosage of 20 .mu.g/ml) and an absence of any impact on
      the production of interleukin-1 at the three dosages employed
      (p&lt;0.05).<br>
      <br>
      Effect on the production of interleukin-6.<br>
      Interleukin-4 was used at the same time as flavopereirine H, since
      it has been shown prior to these experiments that this cytokine
      blocks the spontaneous production of interleukin-6 in certain
      HIV-positive patients.<br>
      In five cases, interleukin-9 was used for comparison, since this,
      too, blocks the production of IL-6 in normal monocytes stimulated
      by LPS.<br>
      The results obtained were as follows:<br>
      * Interleukin-4 inhibited the production of IL-6, but this
      inhibition was never total (p&lt;0.05).<br>
      * Interleukin-9 partially inhibited (up to a maximum of 50%)
      spontaneous production; it never has a compound effect to that of
      interleukin-4 (indeed, in two out of five cases, it caused the
      neutralization of these effects; these results are not shown in
      the tables).<br>
      * Product H showed an inhibitory effect with a very clear dosage
      effect (p&lt;0.05). However, it never led to the total inhibition
      of the spontaneous production of IL-6. On the contrary, in the
      presence of interleukin-4, an amplification effect was almost
      always obtained (except in case #4), with total disappearance of
      production at 3 .mu.g/ml of product H (and often even from 1
      .mu.g/ml) (p&lt;0.05).<br>
      <br>
      In conclusion:<br>
      <br>
      Product H proved toxic at dosages higher than 20 .mu.g/ml in vitro
      on the cells used within the framework of these experiments, viz.
      human monocytes taken both from healthy and from asymptomatic
      HIV-positive donors;<br>
      <br>
      Product H proved able to modulate the production of cytokines:
      this was true directly for primary cytokines, though this effect
      was weak; indirectly, this modification was marked in the case of
      the production of TNF-.alpha. and IL-6, though not IL-1. Product H
      also inhibited the spontaneous production of IL-6 shown in some
      HIV-positive patients. This inhibitory effect, which in these
      experiments was never total, was amplified in the presence of
      IL-4;<br>
      <br>
      The normalization of the IL-6 and TNF-.alpha. responses in the HIV
      positive subject, except for the inhibition of the production of
      IL-1, was highly significant, since product H did not modify the
      potential immune relations between monocytes and lymphocytes, or
      the majority of the inflammatory reactions necessary for survival,
      such as the stimulation of the stock cells of the bone marrow and
      the establishment of a defense reaction on the general level.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 8</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      To test the clinical tolerance and efficacy of flavopereirine a
      clinical study was carried out on 24 HIV-positive patients with
      total T4 lymphocyte counts at absolute values ranging from
      0.2-0.4.times.10@9 /1. All the patients were informed about the
      active ingredient being used and about the other anti-retrovirus
      medicines in use at the time of the study. The selection of
      patients was made on the basis of the absolute T4 lymphocyte
      count: men and women above 18 years of age, having a Karnofsky
      index equal to or higher than 90%, showing presence of anti-HIV I
      antibodies in two successive tests (ELISA method), from groups CDC
      11, CDC III, CDC IV C2, CDC IV E in the CDC 87 classification;
      with hemoglobin higher than 100-120 g/l, neutrophile polynuclears
      higher than 1.5.times.10@9 /1, platelets numbering more than
      80.times.10@9 /1, T4 lymphocytes numbering no more than
      0.2.times.109/1 and no less than 0.4.times.10@9 /1, and the
      absence of anti-retroviral therapy, particularly by AZT.<br>
      <br>
      20 patients were accepted on the basis of the above criteria.
      Before inclusion in the study, a pretherapeutic study was made for
      each patient: postclinical and therapeutic history, clinical
      examination including determination of fever, anorexia and nausea,
      headaches, pruritus, cough and expectoration, diarrhea,
      adenopathies, buccal mycoses, seborrheic dermatitis and Kaposi's
      lesions. A biological study was also undertaken; this included red
      corpuscles, platelets, lymphocytic sub-groups (CD2, CD4, VDS,
      CD19, CD4/8), determination of antigen P24 and microglobulin
      beta-2, of DHL (dehydrogenated lactate), plasmatic ferritin, ALAT
      (alanine-amino-transferase), ASAT (aspartate-aminotransferase) and
      plasmatic creatinine.<br>
      <br>
      The flavopereirine (compound H) was administered in the form of
      600 mg capsules,at a daily dose of 1-3 g, preferably at least
      around 1 g, which is generally active for one day, The average
      length of treatment was 43 .+-.11 weeks. Side effects were few,
      occurring only in the first three months. Neither blood nor renal
      toxicity was observed; nor was there any significant modification
      in ALAT or ASAT. No degradation in the CDC classification and no
      infections were noticed; the Karnofsky's index remained around the
      100% level in all cases- Physical and professional activity on the
      part of the patients remained completely normal.<br>
      <br>
      Immune response to the treatment was expressed mainly in a
      significant increase in CD4+ cells (p.&lt;0.05), as well as in
      CD19+ cells (p&lt;0.05). The negative decline in CD4+ was reversed
      in 18 out of 19 patients (p&lt;0.05).<br>
      <br>
      All the in vitro and in vivo results clearly indicate that the
      flavopereirine compound exerts a significant inhibitory effect on
      the viral infectional capacity of HIV, both in vitro in human
      cells and in vivo in HIV-1 infected patients.<br>
      <br>
      In 10 of the patients treated over a year, the following
      significant variations were further noted:<br>
      Increase in red cells at 9 months;<br>
      Increase in hemoglobin at 9 months;<br>
      Increase in the total lymphocyte mass at 9 and 12 months;<br>
      Increase in CD2 at 9 months;<br>
      Increase in CD4 at 12 months;<br>
      Increase in CD8 at 9 months;<br>
      Increase in CD19 at 6-9 and 12 months;<br>
      Increase in microglobulin beta-2 at 3-6 and 12 months.<br>
      <br>
      In practice, oral administration in solid form, such as tablets or
      capsules, for example, is recommended. A unitary dosage of around
      250-500 mg of active ingredient is particularly appropriate.<br>
      <br>
      The recommended dosage, in the light of the above results and the
      indications of toxicity, is around 1-3 g, which are generally
      active for one day (g/d) and preferably at least around 1 g/d,
      most profitably taken at successive intervals over the course of
      the day.<br>
      <br>
      The dosages and/or galenic forms retained may, however, vary
      according to the state of the patient and the stage of viral
      attack being treated. Their adaptation to the specific case
      concerned in each particular treatment may be easily achieved by
      the professional on the basis of his relevant experience and, if
      necessary, with the assistance of routine preliminary tests. In
      this respect, it is particularly recommended that close attention
      be paid to the data provided by a pharmacokinetic study of the
      patient made in order to establish the half-life, of the active
      ingredient being administered, and, if necessary, to adapt the
      form of pharmaceutical preparation for administration accordingly.
      The latter may, for example, take the form of time-release galenic
      preparations.<br>
      <br>
      Apart from the active ingredient or a salt or other derivative
      thereof, the doses for administration include at least one
      pharmaceutical support or vector, as well as excipients, carriers
      and standard perfumes and/or colorants.<br>

          <b>US4335239</b></big><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      The invention relates to new medicaments useful for the treatment
      of leucocyte and platelet deficiencies, which medicaments are
      polyribonucleotides prepared by degradation of the ribosomic
      ribonucleic acids extracted from micro-organisms or from animal
      organs and are formed of simple chains or "RNA fragments"
      comprising about 20 to 80 ribonucleotide units, the overall ratio
      of purine bases (G+A) to pyrimidine bases (C+U) being between 1.0
      and 2.5. The invention also relates to a process for the
      preparation of these polyribonucleotides by scission of the
      ribosomic ribonucleic acids extracted from suitable
      micro-organisms, by means of a ribonuclease or of a chemicl
      reagent such as an alkali metal base.<br>
      <br>
      This invention relates to polyribonucleotides capable of promoting
      generation of leucocytes and blood platelets.<br>
      <br>
      Recently, in French patent application No. 74/38,768 and C. R.
      Acad. Sci. Paris, Series D. T. 280 (20th January 1975) pages
      363-366, a process has been described for the preparation of
      polyribonucleotides, also called "RNA-fragments," by the action of
      ribonucleases which leave the guanine-adenine (G-A) sequences
      intact (in particular pancreatic ribonuclease) on G and A rich
      ribosomic ribonucleic acids extracted from bacteria or from cells
      of animal organs. The polyribonucleotides thus obtained comprised
      single-stranded chains of about 20 to 80 riboncleotide units, in
      which the purine bases outnumbered the pyrimidine bases, and the
      G-A sequence units predominated.<br>
      <br>
      These polyribonucleotides have been selectively separated into
      various families by passing through a column filled with a
      molecular sieve marketed under the name "Sephadex G 25 fine" in a
      M/100 tris buffer of pH 7.4, elution being effected with the same
      buffer. The fractions separated in this way are called, in order
      of elution, P1, P2, P3, P4 and P5, and correspond to the peaks of
      the curve shown in FIG. 1 of the accompanying drawings, in which
      the volume of eluate is plotted as the ordinate and the absorption
      measured at 260 m.mu. is plotted as the abscissa.<br>
      <br>
      The various families of polyribonucleotides thus obtained have
      been analysed spectrophotometrically, and their contents of purine
      bases, namely guanine (G) and adenine (A), and of pyrimidine
      bases, namely cytosine (C) and uracil (U) determined. The families
      are distinguished from one another by the amount and ratio of the
      bases, the families P1 and P2 being richest in purine bases G and
      A.<br>
      <br>
      It has already been reported that the families called P1 and P2,
      obtained from ribosomic RNA of Escherichia coli M 500, exhibit an
      anti-viral activity, in particular against Shope fibroma virus,
      cow-pox virus and herpes virus.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention provides a medicament for treating leucocyte
      and platelet deficiencies, comprising simple chain
      polyribonucleotides having 20 to 80 ribonucleotide units prepared
      by degradation of the ribosomic ribonucleic acids extracted from
      micro-organisms or animal organs, the overall ratio of purine
      bases to pyrimidine bases [(G+A)/(C+U)] in said
      polyribonucleotides being between 1.0 and 2.5.<br>
      <br>
      It has now been found, according to the invention, that the
      polyribonucleotides, wherein the overall ratio of the purine bases
      to the pyrimidine bases [(G+A)/(C+U)] is between 1.0 and 2.3,
      promote the genesis of leucocytes and of blood platelets and are
      thus useful as medicaments for encouraging leucopoiesis and the
      formation of platelets when a deficiency occurs.<br>
      <br>
      In particular, the products called P3 and P4 and obtained from
      ribosomic RNA of Escherichia coli M 500 Sho-R by the action of
      pancreatic ribonuclease both exhibit a ratio (G+A)/(C+U) of
      between 1.0 and 2.5, according to the invention, and are useful as
      "regenerator" of leucocytes and platelets.<br>
      <br>
      The medicament according to the invention can be prepared in
      accordance with the process described in French patent application
      No. 74/38,768 from various sources (yeasts, bacteria and animal
      organs), in particular by passing E-coli M 500 Sho-R over a
      molecular sieve to select the fractions wherein the ratio
      (G+A)/(C+U) is between 1.0 and 2.5.<br>
      <br>
      However, the invention also relates to an improved process for the
      preparation of these polyribonucleotides which makes it possible
      to obtain them in a simpler manner and with greatly increased
      yield.<br>
      <br>
      The invention accordingly provides a process for the preparation
      of the polyribonucleotides according to the invention, wherein
      ribosomic ribonucleic acids extracted from a micro-organism having
      a ratio (G+A)/(C+U) from 1.0 to 2.5 are degraded by a ribonuclease
      or by a chemical reagent.<br>
      <br>
      According to this improved process, the methods of culture of the
      bacteria, of isolating the ribosomic ribonucleic acids (r-RNA) and
      of preserving them may be identical to those described in French
      patent application No. 74/38,768, the improvement relating to:<br>
      <br>
      (1) the choice of the bacterial strain or other starting material
      (fungi, yeasts or animal organs);<br>
      <br>
      (2) the degradation agent used for the scission of the r-RNA into
      RNA fragments; and<br>
      <br>
      (3) the resulting elimination of the need for fractionating the
      product on a column.<br>
      <br>
      It is preferred to use a wild non-pathogenic strain of E. coli
      T3000 (K 12) belonging to the species which are usually hosts of
      the intestinal flora. In this strain, the ratio of purine bases to
      pyrimidine bases is about 1.0, which is less than the ratio in the
      strain E. coli M 500 Sho-R. However, it is possible to use r-RNA
      isolated from other bacterial strains, fungi, yeasts or animal
      organs in which the ratio of purine bases to pyrimidine bases is
      satisfactory.<br>
      <br>
      The agents used for the degradation can be not only ribonucleases,
      such as pancreatic ribonuclease or a ribonuclease extracted from
      Neurospora crassa, but also strong bases (sodium hydroxide or
      potassium hydroxide), preferably at a final concentration of 0.1 N
      in the reaction solution.<br>
      <br>
      The RNA fragments obtained in this manner from a suitable starting
      material exhibit an overall ratio (G+A)/(C+U) of between 1.0 and
      2.5 and it is not necessary to carry out a fractionation on a
      column.<br>
      <br>

      strain of E. coli rendered resistant to showdomycin described by

      <b>EXAMPLE 1</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      <b>Preparation of P3 and P4 from E. coli M 500 Sho-R.</b><br>
      <br>
      The bacteria of this strain are cultured at 37 DEG C. in a
      well-aerated medium either on a rich medium containing, per liter
      of medium, 10 g of Bacto-tryptone, 5 g of yeast extract, 5 g of
      sodium chloride and sodium hydroxide solution to bring the pH to
      7.3, or, if it is desired at the same time to isolate the
      anti-viral products P1 and P2 and the products P3 and P4, on a
      synthetic medium containing, per liter of medium, 100 ml of
      monopotassium phosphate solution containing 136 g/l, 10 ml of 20%
      strength ammonium sulphate solution, 1 ml of 0.05% iron sulphate
      solution, 1 ml of magnesium sulphate solution containing 20 g/100
      ml, 2 ml of vitamin B1 solution containing 0.5 part per 1,000 and
      potassium hydroxide solution to bring the pH to 7.2, 4 or 5 g per
      1,000 of separately sterilised glucose (20% strength solution)
      being added to this medium after the latter has been sterilised.<br>
      <br>
      At the end of the culture, the bacterial cells are collected by
      centrifuging and can be stored frozen. They are then homogenised
      in the cold in a buffer A (5 ml of 2 M tris/HCl, 30 ml of 2 M KCl,
      and 10 ml of a solution containing 30 g of Mg acetate/100 ml) and
      then ground, and their destruction is completed by ultrasonic
      treatment.<br>
      <br>
      After dilution with a buffer B (similar to buffer A but only
      containing 0.1 ml of Mg acetate and 0.1 ml of mercaptoethanol),
      the mixture is centrifuged for 20 minutes (25 to 30,000 g) and 10
      to 20 .mu.g of desoxyribonuclease per ml are then added to the
      supernatant liquor. The desoxyribonuclease is allowed to act for
      15 minutes at 30 DEG-37 DEG C. and the mixture is then centrifuged
      for 20 minutes (25 to 30,000 g). The supernatant liquor is then
      re-centrifuged for 2 hours at 40,000 rpm in an ultracentrifuge in
      order to collect the ribosomes and the remove the whole of the
      useless RNA 4 S.<br>
      <br>
      The caked ribosomes are homogenised in the presence of buffer B,
      2-3 drops of 20% strength lauryl-sulphate solution are added, and
      the mixture is subjected to thorough mechanical stirring. The
      ribosomic RNA is extracted by the conventional method using phenol
      in the presence of buffer B, several such extractions being
      necessary, and a final extraction with choloroform is effected in
      order thoroughly to remove the phenol and proteins still present.<br>
      <br>
      The aqueous phases are combined and to them is added 96 DEG
      strength cold alcohol containing a little KCl to assist the
      precipitation of the RNA. By centrifuging for 5 minutes at 5,000 g
      it is possible to collect the RNA which is then dialysed overnight
      against distilled water containing 0.1 M KCl.<br>
      <br>
      In the morning, the dialysis is continued for 1 hour against
      distilled water only. The RNA is determined at 260 nm (U.V.) with
      the aid of a spectrophotometer.<br>
      <br>
      The 260/280 ratio makes it possible to check whether the RNA
      preparation is pure. This ratio should be very close to 2.<br>
      <br>
      The RNA is stored frozen or as a lyophilised powder.<br>
      <br>
      The fractionation of the RNA to give polyribonucleotides (RNA
      fragments) is carried out as follows: 70 mg of ribosomic RNA
      (about 10 ml) are brought together with 0.2 ml of a solution of
      crystallised pancreatic ribonuclease. (The solution of pancreatic
      ribonuclease, containing 5 mg/ml, was beforehand boiled for 10
      minutes and then cooled).<br>
      <br>
      The RNA is incubated with the ribonuclease for exactly 30 minutes
      at 36 DEG C. (water bath). The degradation is stopped by adding an
      equal volume of chloroform and stirring vigorously for a few
      minutes. The mixture is centrifuged for 5 minutes at 5,000 g. The
      aqueous phase (upper phase) is removed and, for the second time, a
      equal volume of chloroform is added, after which the mixture is
      stirred and centrifuged. The aqueous phase is immediately
      deposited on a column of fine Sephadex G-25 equilibrated with an
      H2 O-0.1 M tris/HCl buffer of pH 7.4.<br>
      <br>
      The RNA fragments are eluted with this same buffer.<br>
      <br>
      Under these conditions, 5 peaks detectable by absorption at 260 nm
      appear regularly, as illustrated by the elution curve. They are
      called from 1 to 5 in the sequence of elution from the column.<br>
      <br>
      The RNA fragments which constitute peaks 1 and 2 exhibit an
      anti-viral activity.<br>
      <br>
      The RNA fragments constituting peaks 3 and 4 always exhibit a very
      spectacular activity as leucocyte and platelets regenerators and
      constitute the medicaments according to the invention.<br>
      <br>
      The RNA fragments which constitute peak 5 were not kept.<br>
      <br>
      The fractions constituting each of the peaks are combined and
      lyophilised. The products P1, P2, P3 and P4 are thus obtained
      after taking up the dry residue in the minimum amount of distilled
      water, treating this once, vigorously, with an equal volume of
      chloroform, centrifuging the mixture, dialysing the supernatant
      liquid for 24 hours (under oxenic conditions) against sterile
      distilled water and lyophilising to dryness. The products P3 and
      P4 are products according to the invention, as are their mixtures
      in any ratios.<br>
      <br>
      The constitution of the RNA fragments P3 and P4, which are formed
      of simple chains comprising from 25 to 50 nucleotides, was studied
      in accordance with the technique described in French Patent
      Application No. 74/38,768 so as to determine their contents of
      purine bases and pyrimidine bases.<br>
      <br>
      150 .mu.g of RNA fragments are hydrolysed for 1 hour at 100 DEG C.
      (in a boiling water bath). After evaporation in a dessicator, the
      residue is taken up in 0.02 ml of distilled water and subjected to
      thin layer chromatography (ecteola cellulose) in accordance with
      the technique described by G. R. Bjork and L. Svensson (1967,
      Biochim. Biophys. acta, 138, pages 430-432). The hydrolysis
      liberates the purine bases and the pyrimidine bases remain in the
      form of nucleotides.<br>
      <br>
      The constituents of the RNA fragments P3 and P4 were separated by
      closed cell chromatography and identified in accordance with the
      technique described above for the RNA fragments P1 and P2.<br>
      <br>
      The RNA fragment P3 consists of:<br>
      <br>
      A : 29.0<br>
      G : 41.1<br>
      (G + A/C + U = 2.3)<br>
      C : 15.2<br>
      U : 15.0<br>
      <br>
      The RNA fragment P4 consists of:<br>
      <br>
      A : 25.6<br>
      G : 26.3<br>
      (G + A/C + U = 1.06)<br>
      C : 21.0<br>
      U : 27.1<br>
      <br>
      These figures are expressed in mols per 100 mols of nucleotides
      analysed, using the following extension coefficients: A=13;
      G=12.8; C=11.5; and U=10 and correspond to the absorption maximum
      (see Methods in Enzymology XII. Nucleic Acides, Part A, Ed.
      Grossman and K. Moldave, Academic Press (1967), page 386).<br>
      <br>
      The RNA fragments P3 and P4 contain no trace of DNA. This was
      rigorously checked by colorimetry (diphenylamine) and by
      enzymology (activity in the presence of DNA-polymerase).<br>
      <br>
      The process for the preparation of RNA fragments according to the
      inventionfrom r-RNA of E. coli T 3,000, by means of various
      ribonucleases and by means of an alkali metal base, will now be
      described in Examples 2 to 4 below.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 2</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>Degradation of r-RNA of E. coli T 3,000 by pancreatic
        ribonuclease A</b><br>
      <br>
      The r-RNA were obtained from a culture of E. coil T 3,000 by a
      processidentical to that described in Example 1 for the r-RNA of
      E. coli M 500 Sho-R. The degradation of the RNA obtained is
      effected in accordance with the invention by means of a solution
      of pancreatic ribonuclease (grade A) containing 5 mg/ml, which has
      beforehand been heated to 100 DEG C. for 10 minutes (on a boiling
      water bath) and then cooled rapidly.<br>
      <br>
      A mixture of r-RNA and ribonuclease is incubated at 36 DEG C., the
      ribonuclease concentration being the same as in Example 1, but the
      incubation time being shorter, namely 20 minutes (instead of 30
      minutes). [If a different, more or less crystalline, sample of
      pancreatic ribonuclease is used, it is necessary to adapt the
      ribonuclease concentration or the incubation time].<br>
      <br>
      The reaction is stopped by adding a solution of phenol containing
      10% of distilled water (1 volume of this solution per 1 volume of
      reaction mixture), and this mixture is stirred vigorously so as to
      remove the ribonuclease. After centrifuging for 5 minutes at
      10,000 rpm, the aqueous (upper) phase then has an equal volume of
      phenol added to it, and the mixture is stirred and then
      centrifuged. The operation is repeated with chloroform (using
      equal volumes). After separating the phases and repeating the
      operation two or three times, the aqueous phase is dialysed under
      axenic conditions for 16 hours against sterile distilled water at
      4 DEG C.<br>
      <br>
      The amount of non-dialysable RNA fragments is determined by
      absorption in the ultraviolet at 260 nm. The yield of active RNA
      fragments, relative to the initial amount of ribosomic RNA, varies
      from 50 to 60%.<br>
      <br>
      The RNA fragments are stored after lyophilisation.<br>
      <br>
      Electrophoresis, on acrylamide gel, of the RNA fragments reveals
      the presence of a single peak of RNA fragments of smaller size
      than that of the 4 S transferred RNA, as is shown by the attached
      FIG. 2, in which the absorption at 260 nm has been plotted as
      ordinates and the distance travelled in 1 hour 30 minutes as
      abscissae (a method described by M. Beljanski, P. Bourgarel and
      Mrs. M. Beljanski; Ann. Inst. Pasteur 1970, 118, page 253).<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 3</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>Degradation of the r-RNA of E. coli T 3,000 by ribonuclease
        N1</b><br>
      <br>
      Ribonuclease N1, originating from Neurospora crassa and prepared
      and purified as described by K. Kasai et al., J. Bio. Chem. 1969,
      66. page 389, and crystallised once, degrades the
      polyribonucleotide chains at the base G and its controlled action
      on the r-RNA makes it possible to obtain RNA fragments which are
      active in leucopoiesis and in the formation of blood platelets.
      The following conditions are used: 100 mg of r-RNA of E. coli T
      3,000 dissolved in distilled water are incubated in the presence
      of 0.73 ml of ribonuclease N1 (initial solution of 1,000 units/2
      ml). Incubation time: 30 minutes at 36 DEG C. The ribonuclease is
      immediately removed by the phenol and the chloroform as described
      in the case of ribonuclease A; the fragments are dialysed against
      sterile distilled water. The product obtained is lyophilised.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 4</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>Degradation of the r-RNA of E. coli T 3,000 by sodium
        hydroxide solution or potassium hydroxide solution</b><br>
      <br>
      To a solution of 7 to 10 mg of r-RNA/ml is added a solution of
      NaOH or KOH so as to bring the final concentration of the latter
      to 0.1 N.<br>
      <br>
      The incubation is carried out at 36 DEG C. for 30 minutes. The
      mixture is immediately neutralised with an equal volume of 0.1 N
      HCl. The solution is dialysed against distilled water for 16 hours
      at 4 DEG C. The non-dialysable product obtained is lyophilised.
      After hydrolysis of the various RNA fragments of Examples 2, 3 and
      4, the ratio of purine bases/pyrimidine bases was determined. The
      results are given in the table below and expressed in mols per 100
      mols of nucleotides analysed.<br>

      No significant difference is observable between the RNA fragments
      obtained by the various degradation agents mentioned above and
      when using the conditions described above; the sizes of the
      fragments are virtually identical and always less than that of RNA
      4 S (see FIG. 2).<br>
      <br>
      <b>Pharmacological properties</b><br>
      <br>
      The distribution, in the organism, of RNA fragments P3 and P4 of
      Example 1, marked with @14 C, was studied after intravenous
      injection into mice or rabbits.<br>
      <br>
      The RNA fragment P4 marked with @14 C essentially settles in the
      spleen and to a lesser extent in the liver, and is also to be
      found in the bone marrow. The RNA fragment P3 marked @14 C also
      settles and essentially in the same organs, but to a lesser
      degree. On killing the mice treated with these products, an
      increase in the volume and weight of the spleen (shown in FIGS. 3
      and 4) is found solely in the case of the animals treated with P4.
      In FIG. 3, the weight of the spleen (in mg) has been plotted as
      ordinates, and in FIG. 4 the weight of the liver (in g) has been
      plotted as ordinates, in each case as a function of the number of
      days (plotted as abscissae) which elapsed after the animal was
      given a dose of 0.3 mg of product P3 (curves 3) of P4 (curves 4),
      intravenously or intraperitoneally, per 20 g of weight of the
      mouse. The two organs regained their normal weight after 5 to 6
      weeks and radioactivity was no longer found, having undergone
      natural elimination.<br>
      <br>
      The action on the genesis of the leucocytes and the platelets was
      studied in rabbits treated with methotrexate. In animals which
      were given methotrexate (35 mg intramuscularly in the case of
      rabbits), a decrease of about 30% in the leucocytes 48 hours after
      administration of the antimitotic agent was found. Of 3 rabbits
      used for the experiment, 1 rabbit was then subcutaneously given 2
      mg of the mixture of P3 +P4 (in the weight ratio of 1:1); 1 rabbit
      was given the same dose intraperitoneally and a third rabbit was
      only given methotrexate (comparison). The two rabbits treated with
      P3 +P4 regained a virtually normal number of leucocytes in 5-7
      days whilst the comparison rabbit only recovered this normal
      number after about 15 days.<br>
      <br>
      These same rabbits were subsequently given a second dose of
      methotrexate (55 mg intravenously, per rabbit), on day 0 in FIG.
      5.<br>
      <br>
      Two days afterwards, 1 rabbit was given 5 mg of P3 +P4 (weight
      ratio 1/1.5) intraperitoneally, 1 rabbit was given the same dose
      subcutaneously and the third rabbit (the same comparison animal as
      in the preceding experiment) only received the methotrexate. The
      results of the analysis of the number of leucocytes in the blood
      sampled every two days for 20 days are illustrated by FIG. 5.<br>
      <br>
      In FIG. 5, the number of leucocytes is plotted as ordinates as a
      function of the number of days (plotted as abscissae) which have
      elapsed after the injection of methotrexate; it is seen that the
      action of the methotrexate manifests itself, in the three rabbits,
      by a very great lowering of the number of leucocytes (comparison
      results: curve 1), but this lowering was less in the case of the
      two rabbits previously treated with P3 +P4 subcutaneously (curve
      2) or intraperitoneally, than in the case of the comparison
      rabbit.<br>
      <br>
      In the case of the rabbit which was given P3 +P4 intravenously a
      second time (curve 3), the leucocyte number becomes normal in 48
      hours and increases for 24 or 48 hours before stabilising rapidly.
      In the case of the rabbit which was given P3 +P4 subcutaneously,
      curve 2, representing the increase in the number of leucocytes,
      reaches its maximum about the sixth day and then stabilises (FIG.
      5). In contrast, in the case of the comparison rabbit (not treated
      with P3 +P4), the number of leucocytes remains at a low level and
      the animal does not succeed in regaining a normal number over the
      period of observation.<br>
      <br>
      The number of red corpuscles in the rabbits treated in this way
      does not vary.<br>
      <br>
      The pharmacological studies carried out with the RNA fragments
      obtained with various degradation agents in accordance with
      Examples 2 to 4 have shown that there is no significant difference
      in respect of the activity regarding leucopoiesis and regarding
      the formation of platelets, between the products P3 and P4 of
      Example 1 administered by themselves or administered as a mixture
      in any ratio, and each of the products of Examples 2 to 4.<br>
      <br>
      A single dose of each of the products of Examples 2 to 4 (2 to 5
      mg) administered intravenously to strongly and constantly
      immunodepressed rabbits (leucocyte number lowered by 60 to 70%)
      makes it possible to re-establish a normal number of leucocytes in
      24-48 hours. The number of platelets can be increased by these RNA
      fragements by 50 to 100% relative to the number of platelets of
      the comparison animals. FIG. 6 illustrates the results obtained
      over the duration of an experiment (20 to 30 days ) with rabbits
      continuously treated with Endoxan (65 mg/day) and periodically
      treated with the RNA fragments obtained in accordance with one or
      other of Examples 1 to 4.<br>
      <br>
      In FIG. 6, the number of days of the experiment over which the
      rabbits were given 65 mg of Endoxan per day has been plotted as
      abscissae. At the time indicated by the arrow A, the rabbits
      received 2 mg of RNA fragments intravenously. One of the curves of
      FIG. 6 was obtained by plotting the number of leucocytes as
      ordinates and the other curve by plotting the number of platelets
      as ordinates.<br>
      <br>
      All routes can be used for the injection of the active RNA
      fragments, namely intramuscular injection (I.M.), intravenous
      injection (I.V.), subcutaneous injection (S.C.) and intradermal
      injection (I.D.); oral administration is also possible. The
      "response" time varies with the route chosen and depends on the
      dose of product. In rabbits not treated with Endoxan, which have a
      normal blood composition, the intravenous administration of RNA
      fragments does not alter the number of white corpuscles. If the
      dose of product is high, an increase is found, but in 24 hours the
      number of white corpuscles again becomes normal.<br>
      <br>
      The action of various chemical and physical agents (Endoxan,
      Methotrexate, Thiotepa or radiation), and even a genetic
      deficiency causing a decrease in leucopoiesis or a decrease in
      platelets can, from this point of view, be counterbalanced by the
      action of the various abovementioned RNA fragments. The action on
      the genesis of platelets is less rapid than that on the white
      corpuscles, but does allow a large gradual recovery to take place.<br>
      <br>
      The prolongation of the chemotherapy requires a repetition of the
      administration of the RNA fragments without causing exhaustion of
      the phenomenon.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Toxicology</b><br>
      <br>
      The products P3 and P4 of Example 1 and those of Examples 2 to 4,
      dissolved in sterile physiological water, were administered to
      mice and rabbits intravenously, intraperitoneally,
      intramuscularly, subcutaneously and orally. Doses of 1 to 5 mg
      given as a single injection to mice and of 4 to 25 mg to rats,
      these injections being repeated on several days and for up to 15
      days in succession did not make it possible to detect any toxic
      effect of the products.<br>
      <br>
      Markedly higher doses, administered orally, also did not show a
      toxic effect.<br>
      <br>
      Teratological studies have shown that the injection of the
      products according to the invention into female mice in gestation
      has no adverse effect either on the first generation or on
      subsequent generations.<br>
      <br>
      The products according to the invention accordingly are perfectly
      harmless to animals.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Therapeutic application</b><br>
