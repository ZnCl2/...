      <br>
      Remineralization of our agricultural land and garden soils with
      90-plus minerals is the goal of two lifelong advocates of
      sustainable organic food production, Robert Cain and David Yarrow,
      who were brought together by their common interest in the research
      of Maynard Murray, M.D.<br>
      <br>
      As most Acres U.S.A. readers are aware, Dr. Murray was a medical
      doctor and research scientist who was troubled by the obvious
      continual decline of American health and the subsequently
      flourishing pharmaceutical industry. He searched for reasons, on
      biological and chemical levels, as to why our bodies lose their
      resistance to chronic illness and develop degenerative disease.<br>
      <br>
      His studies led him to the sea, where, miraculously, cancer,
      arthritis, arteriosclerosis and aging on a cellular level
      seemingly did not exist. He discovered that sea life is sustained
      in a balanced solution consisting of all 90-plus atomic table
      elements. Murray observed that a cubic foot of seawater contains
      considerably more living organisms than an equivalent amount of
      soil.<br>
      <br>
      Murray theorized that the apparent difference in disease
      resistance and vitality between life on land and in the sea is due
      to mineral deficiencies in our soil and food. He visualized an
      endless cycle wherein continents rise from the sea rich with
      minerals. The constant effects of climate — freezing, thawing,
      rainfall, and erosion — combined with mankind’s historically poor
      stewardship of the land and increasing acid rain cause topsoil
      minerals to go into solution. These mineral solutions then enter
      streams and rivers and subsequently flow into the sea. Murray
      concluded that these minerals hold the key to human health.
      Therefore, it made perfect sense to recapture them and restore
      them to our soils.<br>
      <br>
      Initially, he successfully experimented using diluted seawater on
      soils and crops. Then he discovered that if water is totally
      removed from pure, mineral-enriched seawater, 3.5 percent remains
      as solids. He called these minerals “sea solids” and used them
      exclusively, during many years of extensive research, on all
      ranges of crops and soil types. Murray even developed a
      specialized use of sea solids for hydroponics, and operated a
      successful 13-acre hydroponic fresh-produce farm in southern
      Florida. The results were consistently the same: the plants
      flourished, matured more rapidly, were healthier, were more
      disease and drought resistant, and produced outstanding taste
      along with greater yields. In assays testing for nutrients, foods
      grown with Murray’s sea solids had significantly more minerals
      (ash content), vitamins (25 percent more vitamin C in tomatoes; 40
      percent more vitamin A in carrots) and sugars. In addition, he
      witnessed the same amazing results in all types of livestock and
      poultry that were offered feed grown in soil enriched by his sea
      solids. Physiologically, these animals were healthier, gained
      weight more rapidly, and reached maturity sooner.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
      During his 30 years of research, Murray conclusively proved that
      the proportions of trace minerals and elements present in pure
      seawater are optimum for the growth and health of both land and
      sea life. Additionally, he found that once these minerals and
      trace elements are restored to the soil, reapplication is not
      necessary for five or more years, given normal rainfall and
      climatic conditions. Cain, under Dr. Murray’s direction, applied
      these minerals to both soil and hydroponic food production, and
      personally tasted and witnessed their outstanding effects.<br>
      <br>
      Since creating sea solids by desalinization of seawater is very
      costly, Murray searched the earth for the best source of sea
      solids in their natural form. He required expansive tidal flats on
      the banks of a mineral-rich, unpolluted sea in an arid region with
      little or no rainfall. Prior to his death in 1983, he disclosed to
      Cain the location he had found to be the purest.<br>
      <br>
      Only recently, Cain and Yarrow have begun mining sea solids from
      Murray’s source and distributing the product throughout North
      America. Cain says he believes Dr. Murray discovered the true
      “Fountain of Youth.” However, the fountain with its life-enhancing
      properties is located not at a springhead where a stream or river
      begins, but rather at the opposite end of the ecosystem, where it
      empties into the sea.<br>
      <br>
      Cain and Yarrow’s vision is to improve the quality of human health
      through the food we eat by remineralizing the soil in which it is
      grown. In their opinion, application of these extraordinary sea
      solids with their 90-plus elements — the sea’s full spectrum of
      minerals — to tired and depleted soils is the perfect solution.
      They believe that as stewards of the land, it is our
      responsibility to restore the mineral balance to soils and
      subsequently the foods we ingest. Cain and Yarrow hope to convince
      all stewards of the land to help sustain life on this planet by
      remineralizing their soils and spreading the wisdom of sea energy
      agriculture.<br>

        <br style="font-weight: bold;">
        <big><span style="font-weight: bold;">Process of Applying Sea
            Solids as Fertilizer</span></big><br style="font-weight:
          bold;">

      <br>
      This invention relates to the process of applying sea water solids
      as a fertilizer. by sea solids we mean the inorganic salts that
      are dissolved in the water; the term as it will be used in the
      specification hereinafter does not include living organizms, plant
      or animal, but means merely the salts that are dissolved, which
      will include the salts of the various elements mentioned in this
      application.<br>
      <br>
      This invention relates more particularly to the use of sea solids
      in certain proportions for different crop requirements.<br>
      <br>
      This invnetion further contmeplates the use as a fertilizer of
      complete sea solids mixed with nitrogenous compounds, the
      proportions of each and the total amount of fertilizer depending
      upon the type of crop which it is desired to raise and the
      condition of the soil...<br>
      <br>
      When one is confronted with so many variables, to obtain a plant
      raised under optimum conditions seems to be almost impossible. It
      was therefore decided by the author to obtain the elements from
      sea water in the proportion that they occur there. The most
      soluble salts found in the land should be found in the most
      abundant supply in the sea. Sodium chloride is found in a much
      greater concentration in the sea than are the various barium
      salts. It is known that sodium chloride, per se, in great
      concentrations, is toxic to plants. Therefore it was deemed
      advisable to start with very low concentrations of sea water to
      test their effect on plants. This was done in pot and plot
      experiments, and it was found, after considerable experimentation,
      that sea solids comprising 3-1/2% of sea water could be applied to
      the soil in fairly great concentrations, without detriment to the
      plants. The solids were obtained by evaporating the water
      completely and leaving the elements in solid salt form. <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">The optimum amount found for most
        grain and vegetable plants grown in the temperate zone of the
        USA was from 550 to 2200 pounds per acre... The salt is first
        ground in a burr mill before spreading. The hydroscopic nature
        of the salt required that it be stirred from time to time as it
        was being applied to ensure accurate spreading.</span><br>
      <br>
      Oats, soy beans, grain and many varieties of garden vegetables
      were grown on soil thus treated. In 1954. 1/4 acre of garden
      vegetables were grown; 10 acres of treated and control corn have
      been grown; 10 acres of treated oats along with 10 acres of
      control oats were grown; also 3 acres of treated soy beans and 3
      acres of control soy beans have been grown.<br>
      <br>
      In my experiments to date, I have studied, or am in the process of
      studying, various phases;<br>
      <br>
      First, animals were fed a diet of 4 parts corn, 2 parts oats, and
      1 part soy beans, all grown on land treated with sea solids. This
      was to determine the effect of these grains on normal physiology
      and pathology. <span style="font-weight: bold;">The rats fed on
        the control, or untreated corn, oats, and soy beans, developed
        xerapthaemia in 12 to 14 days. The rats fed on the experimental
        feed did not show eye changes.</span><br>
      <br>
      300 chickens were obtained from a local hatchery when one day old.
      They were divided into 2 groups of 150 each. All were fed the
      commercial concentrate, plus 4 parts of corn and 2 parts of oats.
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">The animals fed on the
        experimental corn and oats matured approximately one month in
        advance of the control. The experimental started to lay eggs 3
        to 4 weeks earlier, and the eggs weighed 2 to 3 ounces more per
        dozen in the experimental flock. Dressed experimental roosters
        at 6 months of age weighed 1-1/2 lb more than the control, and
        there was less food consumed per pound by weight gain in the
        experimental chickens. There was a decided difference in the
        skeletal structures</span> of the experimental and control
      chickens, as shown by x-ray.<br>
      <br>
      Second, productivity. In oats, there was no manifest difference in
      productivity; however, during the growing stage, just before the
      oats headed, there was a marked difference in color. The
      experimental lot was darker green, which was noticeable to the eye
      and is also readily distinguishable in colored photographs. The
      farmer who harvested this crop observed that the experimental plot
      had many more rabbits, suggesting a taste difference. There was
      also <span style="font-weight: bold;">an observable difference in
        the amount of "rust" -- being much more prevalent in the control
        plot. The ash weight showed a 1.1% increase in the experimental.
        The second generation oats showed excellent germination and
        production, although no further applications of sea solids were
        put on the soil. Second generation oats were essentially "rust"
        free.</span><br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">In corn grown in 1952, the
        treated plot yielded 19.6 bushels more per acre than the
        control... In 1954, the experimental plot of corn yielded about
        13 bushels more per acre than the control, the experimental plot
        of corn yielded about 13 bushels more per acre than the control,
        and the experimental showed an increase of 1.7% in ash weight.</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      The control soy beans yielded 8.87 bushels more per acre than the
      experimental soy beans; however, <span style="font-weight: bold;">the
experimental





        showed an increase of 14.6% in ash weight</span>. <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">Second generation soy beans grew
        larger and the production was slightly higher than the control.
        There was also a 5.6% increase in ash weight in the
        experimental, although no further applications of sea solids
        were made.</span><br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">The increase in ash weight of the
        experimental garden vegetables over the control was a s follows:
        Sweet potatoes 8.3%; onions 4.4%; tomatoes 18.7%.</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Third, diseases in plants. There was a marked difference between
      the treated and control plants in <span style="font-weight:
        bold;">"curly leaf" of peach trees, the treated tree being mcuh
        freer of the disease. In blight of tomatoes, the treated plants
        showed a marked difference in resistance to the disease. The
        most phenomenal difference in plant diseases noted was in corn
        smut, which showed 384% more smut in the control than in the
        experimental.</span> These figures are based upon the number of
      observable galls counted on 4.9 acres in each plot. <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">Not only were the galls much less
        numerous in the experimental, but they appeared smaller, and
        fewer were on the ears. These same results were repeated on the
        second generation corn without further application of sea solids
        to the soil.</span><br>
      <br>
      It is known that there are many acres of soil unfit for the growth
      of garden peas. This is said to be due to an infection of the root
      of the plant caused by <span style="font-weight: bold;">Aphanomyces




        and Fusaria</span>, the former being very specific for the pea
      plant, and the latter having the ability to attack other hosts. In
      greenhouse experiments, <span style="font-weight: bold;">I was
        able to grow the pea plant to maturity in soil infested with
        these two organisms with the addition of sea solids, using two
        different varieties of peas. The control plants died at or near
        the blooming stage.</span><br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">"Center rot" in turnips is said
        to be due to a staphylococcus infection. In 100 plants on
        treated and control soil, there was an incidence of center rot
        in 30 of the control, and none in the experimental.</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Fourth, it was also decided to test the effect of sea solids on
      the pH of the soil. The ordinary garden beet was used as an
      indicator plant. In acid soil, this plant is supposed to germinate
      and put forth two leaves which seemingly are healthy. The second
      pair of leaves, however, usually die and the plant will not grow
      to maturity if the soil is too acid. I obtained soil with a pH of
      4. <span style="font-weight: bold;">After the addition of my sea
        solids, I found that the pH decreased slightly, but later
        returned to its original value</span>. I planted beets and
      radishes in this soil treated with sea solids and was able to grow
      them to maturity. I feel that so-called sour soil is deficient,
      and most probably not deficient in calcium alone; that the pH
      itself is not the determining factor as to whether or not the
      ordinary varieties of plants found in this climate will grow. <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">Radishes were grown in treated soil
        with a pH of 4. Beets, a sour soil indicator, grew beyond the
        third and fourth leaf.</span><br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">Observations</span> -- A number
      of observations made during these experiments have been recorded
      for their possible significance. Sheep ignored a field of
      untreated hay to get to a ten foot square patch of treated hay,
      indicating a <span style="font-weight: bold;">taste difference</span>.
      Also, experimental stalks of corn were marked with tape, and mixed
      with control corn. Cattle and sheep would nuzzle through the corn
      to pick out the experimental stalks, again indicating a taste
      difference. The farmer who harvested the oats noticed noticed that
      the experimental oats attracted more rabbits and grasshoppers. A
      taste difference was also noted in garden vegetables. Onions and
      radishes were sweeter&nbsp; than the control vegetables. There was
      also a difference in the taste of lettuce, green beans and
      carrots. <span style="font-weight: bold;">In apples and grapes,
        vitamin A and Vitamin C were found in greater quantity in the
        experimental crop. The experimental grapes were higher in sugar
        content</span>...<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">Summary</span> -- The list of
      elements found to be important in the normal development and
      health of plants and animals has increased steadily over the
      years. The problem has icnreased steadily over the years. The
      problem has been made even more complex by the discovery that the
      availability of an element to the plant may be dependent upon the
      presence or absence of other elements in the soil. The experiments
      of this report are based on three hypotheses:<br>
      <br>
      1 -- That all of the elements may be important in polant and
      animal physiology.<br>
      <br>
      2 -- That the elements should be added to the soil in the exact
      proportion and balance as they are found in sea water, including
      the sodium chloride, This is based on the assumption that the
      solubility of an element determines its rate of leaching from the
      soil, and the amount of it found in sea water,<br>
      <br>
      3 -- That most animals need to have the inorganic elements hooked
      up by plants for proper utilization.<br>
      <br>
      Tolerance experimetns indicated that the amount of complete sea
      solids ( including sodium chloride ) that could be added to
      mid-western and eastern soils ranged from 550 to 2200 pounds per
      acre.<br>
      <br>
      As a specific illustration of the use of sea solids as a
      fertilizer, an experiment was conducted in recent months on
      tomatoes, with the following results :<br>
      <br>
      <div style="text-align: center;"><img src="us307.jpg" alt=""><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      It will thus be noted that 1100 lb per acre of the fertilizer is
      about the proper amount for the best growth of tomatoes.<br>
      <br>
      Complete sea solids are obtained by drying sea water obtained from
      any ocean to complete dryness. The end product contains all
      elements soluble in water or saline solution, as found in sea
      water... <br>
      <br>
      To one ton of these sea solids, ground in a burr mill, I have
      added:<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">80 to 800 lb of ammonium nitrate
        pellets or crystals; or</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">100 to 1100 lb of ammonium
        sulfate; or</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">50 to 400 lb of urea.</span><br>
      <br>
      The range of these nitrogenous compounds is accounted for by the
      fact that different crops require different amounts of N in
      proportion to sea solids. Tolerance experiments with this mixed
      fertilizer have indicated that from 550 to 2200 lb per acre can be
      used on field crops, fruits and vegetables.<br>
      <br>
      I have varied the above process in the following ways: I have used
      sea water with the same proportion of elements described above,
      mixed with proportional amounts of nitrogenous compounds. Also, I
      have applied the sea solids to the land first, and then applied
      the nitrogenous compound afterward.<br>
      <br>
      As hereinbefore described, crops grown on soil fertilized with the
      above-described fertilizer have been analyzed for ash weight,
      vitamins and elements; and production has been noted. The results
      indicate an increase in ash weight, vitamins, number and
      proportion of elements, yield and resistance to plant disease.
      Animals have been fed products grown on fertilized soil with a
      stimulus in growth and improvement in bone and tissue structure.
      Thus it can be seen that the beneficial results of controlled use
      of sea solids or sea solids mixed with nitrogenous compounds are
      readily apparent. From experiments described herein, it is
      apparent that equally beneficial results will be obtained by the
      controlled use of sea solids in the growth of other grains,
      vegetables and fruits.<br>
      <br>
      In this discussion I have used the range of 550 to 2200 lb per
      acre as applied to midwestern or eastern soils. Also, the crop to
      be raised on the land determines the amount to be used. <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">It will be noted that 2200 lb per
        acre increased the production of corn, made no difference in
        production of oats, and decreased the production of soy beans.
        Therefore, soy beans should have no more than 1100 lb per acre.</span>
      Garden vegetables that were outlined in the discussion above had
      2200 lb, all with the same production as untreated vegetables.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">When 550 lb are applied, I apply
        that amount each year for 4 years. The amount of 2200 lb, when
        applied at once, and 550 lb, when applied each year for a period
        of 4 years, will last, on soil with ordinary drainage, for a
        period of 5 years.</span> I analyze the soil to see when sea
      solids should be applied again...<br>

          Nutrient Sea-Solids Solution for Hydroponic Farming<br>

      <br>
      ...In one set of experiments, crops of beans, tomatoes and
      cucumbers were grown in 32 hydroponic beds in accordance with the
      method illustrated in Figure 2. The seeds were sprouted in a
      dilute solution of aqueous sea-solids and transferred to the large
      beds as seedlings approximately 4 inches high. Alternatively, the
      plants can be grown directly from seeds without transplanting. <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">The growing plants were fed twice a
        day using a nutrient solution made up by dissolving 116 lb of
        complete sea-solids in 100,000 lb water, i.e., 9.3 lb / 1000 gal
        water. full production was achieved in about 100 days.
        Preferably, the concentration of sea-solids in the nutrient
        solution employed should not exceed about 8000 ppm by weight</span>.
      While some growth can be achieved using more dilute solutions, in
      general it will be necessary to use solutions of sea-solids
      containing at least about 1000 ppm. Solutions of greater than
      about 8000 ppm tend to retard the plants in a manner similar to
      that observed with the over application of conventional
      fertilizers, and generally should not be employed.<br>
      <br>
      In the manner described above, various crops including wheat,
      oats, radishes, carrots, turnips, beets, tomatoes, corn,
      strawberries, onions, and the like, have been grown successfully
      with nutrient solutions comprising fresh water containing&nbsp;
      containing in the range of about 1000 to 8000 ppm of dissolved
      complete sea solids. These results are all the more surprising in
      view of the comparative experiments which have been made using
      solutions containing equivalent amounts of sodium chloride only.
      Here, it was observed, that dissolved sodium chloride solutions
      are definitely toxic to plants but that solutions of complete
      sea-solids, even though they contained the same quantity of
      dissolved sodium chloride, which when used alone was toxic, can be
      used beneficially as a nutrient solution for the growing plants.<br>
      <br>
      If desired, conventional nitrogenous fertilzer materials and
      inorganic salts can be employed together with diluted sea water,
      or with a dilute solution of complete sea-solids in conventional
      concentrations. For example, in similar experiments described
      above, about <span style="font-weight: bold;">200 ppm of
        K-nitrate sucessfully was employed for each 1000 ppm of complete
        sea solids. Surprisingly, however, direct supplementary
        nitrogenous fertilizer is not required with sea-solid nutrient
        solutions as the hydroponic beds can be inoculated with
        azabactor which is nourished well in nutrient solutions
        comprising sea-solids and has the ability to fix sufficient
        nitrogen out of the air. One method of supplying azobacter
        bacteria to the hydroponic beds is to flow the nutrient solution
        through a bed containing a legume crop such as beans where the
        nutrient solution can come in contact with the nodules on the
        roots of the legumes.</span> Alternatively, bean crops, or other
      legumes can be grown in hydroponic beds interspersed with other
      beds connected in series so that an adequate supply of azabacter
      is assured...<br>
