          breakthrough for child autism, 50% reduction in severity
          (VIDEO)</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Scientists are celebrating a “world-first discovery” which shows
      the “highest improvement” in child autism patients, using fecal
      transplants to massively curtail symptoms and greatly reduce
      suffering.<br>
      <br>
      The results of the initial study involving 18 children show great
      promise: 83 percent of the children had “severe” autism symptoms,
      but just two years later, only 17 percent had “moderate” symptoms,
      while 44 percent fell below the threshold for “mild” autism.<br>
      <br>
      The team recorded a roughly 45-percent drop in language, social,
      and behavioural issues in the children over the course of the
      study.<br>
      <br>
      The initial success of the microbiota or ‘fecal transfer’ therapy
      adds further weight to the theory this, and many other,
      neurological conditions may be strongly connected to the gut
      rather than the brain. &nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      “We are finding a very strong connection between the microbes that
      live in our intestines and signals that travel to the brain,” Dr.
      Rosa Krajmalnik-Brown, a microbiologist at Arizona State
      University who jointly led the study, said, adding that, “Two
      years later, the children are doing even better, which is
      amazing.”<br>
      <br>
      In the US, one in every 59 children is diagnosed with some form of
      autism, which is a spectrum disorder, a vast increase in diagnosis
      from just one in every 150 in 2000. This means that half a million
      people on the autism spectrum will become adults in the next
      decade, “a swelling tide for which the country is unprepared,”
      according to the researchers. &nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      In children with autism, gastrointestinal symptoms such as
      constipation and diarrhoea can cause irritability, decreased
      attention span, and negatively impact behaviour, exacerbating
      other symptoms and making treatment and condition management far
      more difficult.<br>
      <br>
      The regimen consists of pre-treatment with a bowel cleanse,
      administering a stomach acid suppressant and fecal transplants for
      between seven and eight weeks. The ‘donation’ of more diverse gut
      bacteria greatly boosts overall health and wellbeing in the
      patients.<br>
      <br>
      Much larger trials are required before the treatment is officially
      approved by the US Food and Drug Administration.<br>
      <br>
      The treatment was originally pioneered by Dr. Thomas Borody, an
      Australian gastroenterologist, who has hailed the results as a
      significant breakthrough.<br>
      <br>
      “This is a world-first discovery... I would call it the highest
      improvement in a cohort that anyone has achieved for autism
      symptoms,” he said.<br>

      <br>
      According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about
      one in every 59 children in the U.S. is diagnosed with autism, up
      from one in every 150 in 2000. They report that “about half a
      million people on the autism spectrum will become adults over the
      next decade, a swelling tide for which the country is unprepared.”
      <br>
      <br>
      The apparent rise in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and its
      stubborn resistance to treatment has spurred a legion of
      researchers to enter the field and explore the disability in
      innovative ways.<br>
      <br>
      Currently, effective treatments for ASD include behavioral
      therapy, speech and social therapy, psychiatric medications, and
      dietary and nutritional approaches. However, no medical treatments
      have been approved to treat core symptoms of ASD such as social
      communication difficulties and repetitive behaviors.<br>
      <br>
      One promising avenue of autism research involves the gut
      microbiome, which is the collection of microbes that lives in our
      intestines and helps us in many ways including digestion of our
      food, training our immune system and preventing overgrowth of
      harmful bacteria. Recent research suggests our gut microbiomes
      also affect brain communication and neurological health.
      Worldwide, interest is growing in the idea that changes in normal
      gut microbiota may be responsible for triggering a vast range of
      diseases.<br>
      <br>
      In a new study, “Long-term benefit of Microbiota Transfer Therapy
      in Autism Symptoms and Gut Microbiota,” published in Scientific
      Reports, Arizona State University researchers Rosa
      Krajmalnik-Brown, Ph.D., James Adams, Ph.D, and lead author
      Dae-Wook Kang, Ph.D, demonstrate long-term beneficial effects for
      children diagnosed with ASD through a revolutionary technique
      known as Microbiota Transfer Therapy (MTT), a special type of
      fecal transplant originally pioneered by Dr. Thomas Borody, an
      Australian gastroenterologist. Remarkably, improvements in gut
      health and autism symptoms appear to persist long after treatment.<br>
      <br>
      At two years post-treatment, most of the initial improvements in
      gut symptoms remained. In addition, parents reported a slow steady
      reduction of ASD symptoms during treatment and over the next two
      years. A professional evaluator found a 45% reduction in core ASD
      symptoms (language, social interaction and behavior) at two years
      post-treatment compared to before treatment began.<br>
      <br>
      “We are finding a very strong connection between the microbes that
      live in our intestines and signals that travel to the brain,” said
      Krajmalnik-Brown, a professor at the Biodesign Swette Center for
      Environmental Biotechnology at the Biodesign Institute and ASU’s
      School for Sustainable Engineering and the Built Environment. “Two
      years later, the children are doing even better, which is
      amazing.”<br>
      <br>
      “Many kids with autism have gastrointestinal problems, and some
      studies, including ours, have found that those children also have
      worse autism-related symptoms,” said Krajmalnik-Brown. “In many
      cases, when you are able to treat those gastrointestinal problems,
      their behavior improves.”<br>
      <br>
      Roughly 30-50% of all people with autism have chronic
      gastrointestinal (GI) problems, primarily constipation and/or
      diarrhea that can last for many years. That chronic discomfort and
      pain can cause irritability, decreased attention and learning, and
      negatively impact behavior.<br>
      <br>
      An earlier study with only vancomycin (an antibiotic) had found
      major temporary improvements in GI and autism symptoms, but the
      benefits were lost a few weeks after treatment stopped despite use
      of over-the-counter probiotics.<br>
      <br>
      So, the question at hand was what’s going on in the gut, and how
      does it affect both physical and behavioral symptoms of autism,
      and how can we develop a long-lasting treatment?<br>
      <br>
      Krajmalnik-Brown, Kang and Adams have shown that by transferring
      healthy microbiota to individuals lacking certain gut bacteria, it
      is possible to “donate” a more diverse set of bacteria into the
      patient and improve gut health.<br>
      <br>
      In Australia, Fecal Microbiota Transplantation (FMT) was initially
      developed by Borody. At his Centre for Digestive Diseases in
      Sydney, Borody has overseen more than 18,000 FMTs for various
      disorders since 1987. He pioneered in Australia the use of FMT for
      colitis and Clostridium difficile infection, and was the first to
      use oral FMT to treat children with ASD. Only one dose of FMT is
      usually enough to cure C. Difficile infections, but his patients
      with autism were far harder to treat. He discovered that three
      months of daily FMT was required to treat his autism patients, but
      eventually resulted in significant improvements in both GI and
      autism symptoms. <br>
      <br>
      Based on his experience with his patients, Borody led the design
      of the clinical treatment used at ASU for this study. The MTT
      approach involves 10 weeks of treatment, including pre-treatment
      with vancomycin, a bowel cleanse, a stomach acid suppressant, and
      fecal microbiota transfer daily for seven to eight weeks.<br>
      <br>
      The initial open-label study, led by Krajmalnik-Brown and Adams,
      and published in the journal Microbiome in 2017, concluded that
      “this exploratory, extended-duration treatment protocol thus
      appears to be a promising approach to alter the gut microbiome and
      improve GI and behavioral symptoms of ASD. Improvements in GI
      symptoms, ASD symptoms, and the microbiome all persisted for at
      least eight weeks after treatment ended, suggesting a long-term
      impact.”&nbsp; The present study now shows the benefits are
      extended beyond eight weeks to at least two years post-treatment.<br>
      <br>
      The ASU team compared differences in the microbiome of children
      with autism compared to typically developing children. At the
      start of the study, children with autism were found to have lower
      diversity in their respective gut microbes and were depleted of
      certain strains of helpful bacteria, such as Bifidobacteria and
      Prevotella. “Kids with autism are lacking important beneficial
      bacteria, and have fewer options in the bacterial menu of
      important functions that bacteria provide to the gut than
      typically developing kids,” Krajmalnik-Brown said.<br>
      <br>
      FMT treatment substantially increased microbial diversity and the
      presence of helpful bacteria in the gut, such as Bifidobacteria
      and Prevotella. After two years, diversity was even higher and the
      presence of beneficial microbes remained.<br>
      <br>
      “We originally hypothesized that our therapy would be efficient to
      transform the dysbiotic gut microbiome toward a healthy one. In
      our original paper in 2017, we reported an increase in gut
      diversity together with beneficial bacteria after MTT, and after
      two years, we observed diversity was even higher and the presence
      of beneficial microbes remained,” Kang said. He added that this
      may be one of the reasons for success in improving the gut health,
      but further mechanistic studies are warranted to define specific
      roles of gut microbes in the context of autism.<br>
      <br>
      The work done at ASU is not only about treating patients but also
      about learning from the treatment in order to develop better
      formulations and optimize dosing.<br>
      <br>
      “Understanding which microbes and chemicals produced by the
      microbes are driving these behavioral changes is at the heart of
      our work,” Krajmalnik-Brown said. The team’s new publication
      reports that the study demonstrated that two years after treatment
      stopped the participants still had an average of a 58% reduction
      in GI symptoms compared to baseline. In addition, the parents of
      most participants reported “a slow but steady improvement in core
      ASD symptoms.”<br>
      <br>
      “Every family completed the study, and every family returned two
      years later for a follow-up evaluation,” said Adams, citing the
      families’ dedication to the research. “The treatment was generally
      well-tolerated with minimal adverse effects.”<br>
      <br>
      "This is a world-first discovery that when we treated the gut
      bacteria in these children during our clinical trial two years ago
      to reset their microbiome with FMT, positive results are still
      continuing to be improving two years from the original treatments.
      I would call it the highest improvement in a cohort that anyone
      has achieved for autism symptoms,” said Borody.<br>
      <br>
      Professional evaluation revealed a 45% decrease in ASD symptoms
      compared to baseline. Researchers note that although there may be
      some placebo effect, much of that effect appears to be real.&nbsp;
      At the start of the study, 83% of participants were rated as
      “severe” autism.&nbsp; At the end of the study, only 17% were
      “severe,” 39% were “mild/moderate,” and 44% were below the cut-off
      for mild ASD. <br>
      <br>
      Greg Caporaso, at Northern Arizona University, a leading expert in
      microbiome data science and a co-author on these studies, helped
      to analyze the microbiome data to better understand bacterial
      changes as a result of MTT. <br>
      <br>
      “Drs. Krajmalnik-Brown, Kang and I are excited about the results,
      but we want to caution the public that we need larger clinical
      trials for this to become an FDA-approved treatment,” said Adams.
      Professional expertise is required for safe and effective
      treatment.<br>
      <br>
      MTT improves GI distress by introducing key strains of beneficial
      bacteria and helping to raise levels of biodiversity within the
      gut, boosting health overall.<br>
      <br>
      Adams has both professional and personal reasons for doggedly
      pursuing ways to help children with autism because he knows the
      situation first-hand. His daughter was diagnosed with autism just
      before her third birthday.&nbsp; Adams, a President’s Professor at
      ASU’s School for Engineering of Matter, Transport and Energy, and
      the chair of Materials Sciences, is also president of the Autism
      Society of Greater Phoenix, the largest parent support group in
      Arizona.<br>
      <br>
      “Dr. James Adams is the reason why I started working on autism,”
      Krajmalnik-Brown said. “I had the methods to do all of the
      measurements and assessments in the microbiome part of the work,
      and he had the autism knowledge.”<br>
      <br>
      Adams recruited patients, supervised clinical work and ASD
      assessments, and guided the patients through the trials, and
      Krajmalnik-Brown led the microbiome evaluations and helped plan
      the study.<br>
      <br>
      All of the participants in the study exhibited chronic GI symptoms
      from infancy, including chronic constipation and/or chronic
      diarrhea. The treatment benefits extended beyond their physical
      symptoms, even causing some parents to note how much their
      children’s behavior had improved over time.<br>
      <br>
      “It is very unusual to see steady gradual improvement after the
      conclusion of any treatment,” said Adams. “We only conducted the
      long-term follow-up study after several families told us that
      their child was continuing to improve significantly.”
      Krajmalnik-Brown stated that the data suggests that the MTT
      intervention transformed the gut environment into a healthier
      status, leading to long-term benefit on both GI and ASD symptoms.<br>
      <br>
      Adams said many of the participants in the trial shared common
      traits, including birth by C-section, reduced breastfeeding,
      increased antibiotics, and low fiber intake by the mother and
      child, all of which lead to limited biodiversity in their gut
      bacteria. Due to the open label nature of the study and the small
      sample size used, more research is needed in order to verify the
      usefulness of MTT as a therapeutic.<br>
      <br>
      The initial study involved a “first-generation” estimate as to
      optimal dose and duration of treatment, and it was enough for 90%
      of the children to have substantial benefit. The team is now
      working on optimizing the dosing and duration to try to improve
      benefits even more, and to determine if booster doses may be
      needed in some cases.<br>
      <br>
      Krajmalnik-Brown and Adams are working now on a larger
      placebo-controlled trial in adults with ASD to verify their
      results. More information on that study is available at
      autism.asu.edu. They also hope to do another study for children
      with ASD pending future funding...<br>

      Many studies have reported abnormal gut microbiota in individuals
      with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD), suggesting a link between
      gut microbiome and autism-like behaviors. Modifying the gut
      microbiome is a potential route to improve gastrointestinal (GI)
      and behavioral symptoms in children with ASD, and fecal microbiota
      transplant could transform the dysbiotic gut microbiome toward a
      healthy one by delivering a large number of commensal microbes
      from a healthy donor. We previously performed an open-label trial
      of Microbiota Transfer Therapy (MTT) that combined antibiotics, a
      bowel cleanse, a stomach-acid suppressant, and fecal microbiota
      transplant, and observed significant improvements in GI symptoms,
      autism-related symptoms, and gut microbiota. Here, we report on a
      follow-up with the same 18 participants two years after treatment
      was completed. Notably, most improvements in GI symptoms were
      maintained, and autism-related symptoms improved even more after
      the end of treatment. Important changes in gut microbiota at the
      end of treatment remained at follow-up, including significant
      increases in bacterial diversity and relative abundances of
      Bifidobacteria and Prevotella. Our observations demonstrate the
      long-term safety and efficacy of MTT as a potential therapy to
      treat children with ASD who have GI problems, and warrant a
      double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in the future.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Introduction</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The human gut and brain interact in complex ways, and abnormal
      conditions in the gut may predispose individuals to
      neurodevelopmental disorders1,2. Individuals with Autism Spectrum
      Disorders (ASD)3, Parkinson’s disease4, and Alzheimer’s disease5,
      for example, have been known to experience chronic
      gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms as a common co-occurring medical
      condition, suggesting the presence of a gut-brain axis. Hallmayer
      et al.6 investigated 192 twin pairs and found that both genetic
      and environmental factors contribute to the etiology of ASD. The
      gut microbiome represents an important environmental factor that
      may exert an influence on symptoms, and a growing number of
      research groups have observed that children with ASD have
      distinctive gut microbiomes compared to neurotypical
      children7,8,9,10,11. Moreover, multiple mouse studies have
      reported that gut microbes and their metabolites can impact
      behavior through the gut-brain axis, including for ASD12,13,14.<br>
      <br>
      Effective treatments for ASD include behavioral therapy, speech
      and social therapy, and dietary/nutritional/medical treatments,
      but no medical treatment has been approved to treat core symptoms
      of ASD15, such as social communication difficulties and repetitive
      behaviors. Considering the link between the gut and brain,
      modulating the gut microbiome by antibiotics, probiotics,
      prebiotics, and/or fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) could be a
      viable therapeutic option. In FMT, a large diversity and number of
      commensal microbes from a healthy donor are used to transform a
      dysbiotic gut microbiome into a healthy microbiome. In fact, FMT
      is the most effective therapy to treat recurrent Clostridium
      difficile infection16 and has shown varying levels of success for
      treating other GI disorders17, which has drawn attention to the
      method for use beyond GI-associated disorders18. Previously, we
      performed a pioneering open-label modified-FMT trial with an
      intensive combination called Microbial Transfer Therapy (MTT)
      consisting of two-week vancomycin treatment followed by a bowel
      cleanse and then high dose FMT for 1–2 days and 7–8 weeks of daily
      maintenance doses along with a stomach-acid suppressant,
      administered to children with ASD and chronic gastrointestinal
      problems19. After this 10-week MTT treatment and an eight-week
      follow-up observation period (18 weeks in total), we observed an
      80% reduction in GI symptoms and a slow but steady improvement in
      core ASD symptoms. At the same time, we learned that gut microbial
      diversity, including potentially beneficial microbes,
      significantly increased after MTT19. Two years after this original
      clinical trial was completed, we re-evaluated the participants to
      determine whether observed improvements in behavior and GI
      symptoms persisted, and to ascertain the long-term impact of MTT
      on the gut microbiome of the study participants.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Results and Discussion</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>Improvements in GI and ASD symptoms remained two years
        after the MTT stopped</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Two years after the MTT was completed, we invited the 18 original
      subjects in our treatment group to participate in a follow-up
      study, and all provided informed consent. We performed the same GI
      and behavior tests that we employed previously19. 12 of 18
      participants made some changes to their medication, diet, or
      nutritional supplements, but these changes were well documented
      and were mostly minor (Supplementary Table S1). We note that due
      to the open-label nature of this initial trial, all of the
      assessments are subject to placebo effect, however the long-term
      improvements we observed here are promising. Two years after
      treatment, most participants reported GI symptoms remaining
      improved compared to baseline (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. S1).
      The improvement was on average 58% reduction in Gastrointestinal
      Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS) and 26% reduction in % days of
      abnormal stools (Daily Stool Record or DSR) relative to baseline,
      and this result is similar to what we observed at the end of
      treatment. The improvement in GI symptoms was observed for all
      sub-categories of GSRS (abdominal pain, indigestion, diarrhea, and
      constipation, Supplementary Fig. S2a) as well as for all
      sub-categories of DSR (no stool, hard stool, and soft/liquid
      stool, Supplementary Fig. S2b), although the degree of improvement
      on indigestion symptom (a sub-category of GSRS) was reduced after
      2 years compared with weeks 10 and 18. This achievement is
      notable, because all 18 participants reported that they had had
      chronic GI problems (chronic constipation and/or diarrhea) since
      infancy, without any period of normal GI health (Supplementary
      Table S2). The families generally reported that ASD-related
      symptoms had slowly, steadily improved since week 18 of the Phase
      1 trial, and this was consistent with the data reported in Fig.
      1b–f. Based on the Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS) rated by a
      professional evaluator, the severity of ASD at the two-year
      follow-up was 47% lower than baseline (Fig. 1b), compared to 23%
      lower at the end of week 10. At the beginning of the open-label
      trial, 83% of participants rated in the severe ASD diagnosis per
      the CARS (Fig. 2a). At the two-year follow-up, only 17% were rated
      as severe, 39% were in the mild to moderate range, and 44% of
      participants were below the ASD diagnostic cut-off scores (Fig.
      2a). The parent-rated Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) assessment
      revealed that 89% of participants were in the severe range at the
      beginning of the trial, but the percentile dropped to 47% at the
      two-year follow-up (Fig. 2b), with 35% in the mild/moderate range
      and 18% below the cut-off for ASD. For the parent-rated Aberrant
      Behavior Checklist (ABC), total scores continued to improve, and
      were 35% lower relative to baseline (versus 24% lower at the end
      of treatment, relative to baseline; Fig. 1d). The Parent Global
      Impressions-III (PGI-III) scores remained similar to the scores at
      the end of treatment (week 10) of the open-label (Fig. 1e). The
      Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale (VABS) equivalent age continued
      to improve (Fig. 1f), although not as quickly as during the
      treatment, resulting in an increase of 2.5 years over 2 years,
      which is much faster than typical for the ASD population, whose
      developmental age was only 49% of their physical age at the start
      of this study. Moreover, we observed improvement in behaviors in
      most sub-categories (Supplementary Figs S2c,d, and S3 for ABC,
      SRS, and VABS, respectively).<br>
      <br>
      Overall, the most substantial improvements observed were on the
      CARS assessments, which was conducted by a professional evaluator
      and is less susceptible to placebo-effect20. CARS is a stable and
      consistent diagnostic tool with high predictive validity21 and has
      been used to evaluate participants before and after therapeutic
      interventions in multiple studies20,22,23. For the follow up CARS,
      the evaluator collected current information based on each
      question’s unique criteria. After the interview was complete for
      each question, the evaluator reviewed the information initially
      collected at baseline and used it for calibrating the final
      evaluation.<br>

      <b>Improvements in GI and ASD symptoms were significantly
        correlated</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      We performed statistical analyses to assess whether improvements
      in GI and ASD severity were correlated. As shown in Fig. 2c–e,
      percentage changes in CARS, SRS, and ABC scores were positively
      correlated with percent changes in GSRS scores (Spearman
      correlation test, 2-tailed p?&lt;?0.005 and r?&gt;?0.7), implying
      that GI relief provided by MTT may ameliorate behavioral severity
      in children with ASD, or vice versa, or that both may be similarly
      impacted by another factor. Another GI assessment, DSR, however,
      showed that there was no significant correlation. Although the
      direction of the influence is not clear, a potential clinical link
      between GI and behavior severity is consistent with what previous
      studies have reported24,25.<br>
      ASD fecal bacterial diversity was higher two years after the MTT
      stopped<br>
      <br>
      16 out of 18 original ASD participants provided an additional
      fecal sample two years after the open-label trial. Based on 16S
      ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene amplicon sequencing analysis, most
      participants maintained higher gut microbiota diversity two years
      after treatment relative to baseline. Interestingly, for many
      individuals, the bacterial diversity was higher at two years than
      at the week 18 follow up as measured by Faith’s Phylogenetic
      Diversity (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Fig. S4a) and Observed OTUs
      (Supplementary Fig. S5a). Considering low gut bacterial diversity
      in individuals with ASD26 and other human disorders27,28,29, an
      increase in diversity after MTT may reflect that MTT intervention
      successfully transformed gut environment into a healthier status
      and led to a long-term benefit on GI and behavior symptoms<br>
      <br>
      Upon completion of the original MTT treatment, we observed that
      the unweighted UniFrac distance30 between the gut microbiota of
      MTT recipients and their corresponding donors was smaller than
      before treatment, suggesting some engraftment of the donor
      microbiome into the recipients by MTT19. Interestingly, two years
      after the trial, the recipients were as different from the donor
      microbiome as they were pre-treatment as measured by unweighted
      UniFrac distance (Fig. 3b, Supplementary Fig. S4b) and several
      other metrics of community dissimilarity (Supplementary Fig.
      S5b–e). This suggests that the recipients didn’t retain completely
      the donated microbiome, but rather retained some features of it
      such as increased overall diversity, and increase in some
      important microbes such as Prevotella, while finding a new state.<br>
      Bifidobacterium and Prevotella relative abundances remained higher
      in feces of participants with ASD two-years after MTT stopped<br>
      <br>
      Three taxa that were noticeably enhanced in MTT recipients at the
      conclusion of the original clinical trial19 were revisited during
      the two-year follow-up. Notably, compared to baseline, median
      relative abundances of Bifidobacteria and Prevotella increased
      4-fold and 712-fold at week 10, and 5-fold and 84-fold at two
      years, respectively (Fig. 4a,b). Desulfobivrio relative abundance
      decreased since week 18 (Fig. 4c), but at the two-year follow-up
      was still marginally higher compared to baseline (two-tailed
      Wilcoxon signed-rank test, p?=?0.07) and higher than neurotypical
      controls (two-tailed Mann-Whitney U test, p?&lt;?0.05). An
      increase in Prevotella after MTT is noteworthy, since its lower
      abundance in feces of children with ASD compared with neurotypical
      children has been confirmed in two different cohorts26,31. A
      recent study also found reduced levels of Prevotella in the oral
      microbiome of children with ASD32. Prevotella may be involved in
      butyrate production33, a key nutrient for the intestinal
      epithelial cells34. In addition, its co-occurrence with
      Desulfovibrio may reflect a synergistic advantage to outcompete
      other commensal microbes that utilize mucin as nutrients35,
      although more research is needed on how their ecological niche in
      mucin desulfation could contribute to an integrity of gut
      epithelial cells36 as well as to the improvement on GI and
      behavior symptoms we observed. Further mechanistic studies with
      multi-omic approaches are warranted to define the roles of
      Prevotella and Desulfovibrio in the context of autism.<br>
      <br>
      To the best of our knowledge, long-term follow-up studies are rare
      for medical treatment of individuals with ASD. In treatments with
      vancomycin37 or phytochemical sulforaphane38, benefits were lost
      within two or four weeks, respectively, of the treatments being
      discontinued. Thus, the long-term benefits observed here two years
      after MTT stopped are very encouraging, and MTT-driven gut
      microbiota transformation seems robust and long-lasting for the
      treatment of ASD. Despite steady and continuous improvement in
      behaviors over two years, we must underscore that the original
      clinical trial and current follow-up study are open-label trials
      without a control for placebo effect. Autism symptoms are
      relatively stable over time without a major intervention: for
      example, a trajectory study with 345 children with ASD showed that
      more than 80% of participants with ASD retained unexpectedly
      stable core symptoms severity over 8 to 12 years39. The VABS
      observations indicate that the improvements in adaptive behaviors
      observed here were substantially more than expected for children
      with ASD over two years. A limitation of this study is that 12 out
      of 18 participants made one or more changes to their medications,
      nutritional supplements, and diets between the end of the original
      MTT trial and the two-year follow-up since the treatment stopped
      (Supplementary Table S1). As described in detail in the methods
      section, participants were asked to rate the perceived
      effectiveness on GI and ASD symptoms (on a scale of 0–4) caused by
      changes in medications, diet, or nutritional supplements. Although
      the scale on the perceived effectiveness is still subjective and
      difficult to interpret, low scores received (1.1 for GI and 0.8
      for ASD symptoms) suggest that these treatments on average could
      have only “slight effect”. Thus, it appears that most of the
      changes observed were probably due to the MTT, although we still
      need follow-up studies to understand whether the improvement by
      MTT were solely from vancomycin, MoviPrep, Prilosec, Standardized
      Human Gut Microbiota (SHGM), or a combination of these individual
      factors. For example, some participants in our study could have GI
      symptoms that were acid-peptic in nature, and their improvements
      on GI symptoms might be solely attributed to the administration of
      stomach-acid suppressant (Prilosec)40. We hypothesize that MTT may
      also be beneficial for children with ASD who do not have obvious
      GI symptoms but have low diversity of gut bacteria, as our
      previous study26 found that most children with ASD had low gut
      bacterial diversity, regardless of whether they have GI problems.<br>
      <br>
      Here, we also would like to address a potential study limitation
      interpreting the improvement on GI symptoms after MTT, since these
      heterogeneous GI symptoms could reflect a wide range of underlying
      etiological GI pathologies. Although we reviewed medical histories
      to exclude children with known gastrointestinal diagnoses (such as
      ulcerative colitis, Crohn’s Disease, celiac disease, eosinophilic
      gastritis, or similar conditions)19, we did not conduct additional
      GI diagnostic evaluations, which is a limitation of this study.
      Thus, we want to underscore need of follow-up studies embracing
      more thorough examination of participants’ GI pathologies in order
      to better understand effectiveness of MTT.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Conclusions</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      In summary, all 18 participants with ASD were re-evaluated two
      years after MTT treatment stopped, and we observed significant
      improvements both in GI and behavior symptoms as compared with
      baseline measurements collected at the beginning of the original
      open-label trial. GI benefits were mostly maintained from the end
      of treatment, and autism symptoms were reported to have improved
      significantly since the end of treatment. Changes in gut
      microbiota persisted at two years, including in overall community
      diversity and relative abundances of Bifidobacteria and
      Prevotella. These encouraging observations demonstrate that the
      intensive MTT intervention is a promising therapy for treating
      children with ASD who have GI problems. We recommend future
      research including double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized
      trials with a larger cohort...<br>
