        <b>US4501923</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      A process is described for preparing adrenochrome comprising
      oxidizing adrenaline or a salt thereof with a persulfate in an
      aqueous medium at a pH in the range 4 to 8 in the presence of one
      or more water-soluble salts of bismuth.<br>
      <br>
      This invention relates to a process for preparing adrenochrome,
      and in particular to the preparation of high quality adrenochrome
      by oxidation of adrenaline.<br>
      <br>
      Adrenochrome is an intermediate for adrenochrome monosemicarbazone
      and adrenochrome monoaminoguanidine known as hemostatics.
      Adrenochrome has been commercially prepared by oxidizing
      adrenaline or its salts with potassium ferricyanide in an aqueous
      medium. This process is uneconomical in view of the large
      quantities of potassium ferricyanide needed and the ensuing
      effluent disposal problems, together with variability in product
      quality. It is reported in the literature that persulfates can be
      employed as the oxidizing agent. The use of the persulfates is
      advantageous since the problems associated with the use of
      potassium ferricyanide are precluded and they are significantly
      cheaper than potassium ferricyanide. However, the oxidation
      process with persulfates is slow so that long reaction periods are
      required for complete reaction. This is disadvantageous in
      operation efficiency of a process. Also, this results in lowering
      of yields of adrenochrome since the produced adrenochrome may be
      further oxidized to decompose to black by-products during the
      reaction. Accordingly, oxidation with persulfates is not practical
      for the commercial manufacture of adrenochrome.<br>
      <br>
      <b>British Patent Specification No. 1,519,756</b> discloses a
      process for preparing adrenochrome by oxidizing adrenaline or a
      salt thereof with a persulfate in the presence of a water-soluble
      salt of copper, zinc, nickel or cobalt. The presence of these
      catalysts provides a high reaction rate and a good yield of high
      quality adrenochrome.<br>
      <br>
      We have now found a further range of catalysts which are effective
      in catalysing the oxidation of adrenaline with a persulfate.<br>
      <br>
      According to the present invention, there is provided a process
      for preparing adrenochrome which comprises oxidizing adrenaline or
      a salt thereof with a persulfate in an aqueous medium at a pH in
      the range 4 to 8 in the presence of one or more water-soluble
      salts of bismuth.<br>
      <br>
      Bismuth salts are not particularly soluble in water but their
      solubilities are adequate in the quantities employed in the
      process of the invention.<br>
      <br>
      The presence of water-soluble salts of bismuth accelerates the
      oxidation reaction resulting in high quality adrenochrome in high
      yields. Any water-soluble salt of bismuth can be employed in the
      present invention although the nitrate and oxynitrate salts are
      preferred. Other suitable bismuth salts include bismuth
      oxycarbonate and bismuth citrate.<br>
      <br>
      Suitable persulfates for use in the present invention include
      potassium persulfate, sodium persulfate and ammonium persulfate.
      Sodium and ammonium persulfates are preferred in view of their
      good solubility in water.<br>
      <br>
      The aqueous reaction medium is maintained at a pH from 4 to 8.
      Preferably a buffer is present, e.g., sodium hydrogencarbonate,
      sodium dihydrogenphosphate, disodium hydrogenphosphate, potassium
      acetate and sodium acetate. Sodium hydrogencarbonate is preferred.<br>
      <br>
      The oxidation reaction of adrenaline with the persulfate is
      conducted in an aqueous medium at pH 4 to 8 in the presence of one
      or more water-soluble bismuth salts. Generally, a uniform aqueous
      solution of adrenaline is first prepared by adding an acid such as
      hydrochloric acid to an aqueous dispersion of adrenaline, or by
      directly dissolving a salt of adrenaline in water. The aqueous
      solution is then added to a separately prepared aqueous medium
      containing the persulfate, the bismuth catalyst and the buffer.<br>
      <br>
      The water-soluble bismuth salt may be employed in an amount of
      from 0.001 to 0.01 mole, preferably 0.005 to 0.01 mole, per mole
      of adrenaline. Amounts of the bismuth salts less than 0.001 mole
      do not significantly increase the reaction rate. Amounts of the
      bismuth salt in excess of 0.01 mole may lead to excessive
      oxidation causing decomposition of the produced adrenochrome and
      the formation of tar-like by-products.<br>
      <br>
      The persulfate is generally used in an amount in the range 2.0 to
      2.5 mole per mole of adrenaline. A buffer is generally used in an
      amount of from 4 to 7 moles, preferably 5 to 6 moles, per mole of
      adrenaline.<br>
      <br>
      The reaction is generally carried out at -5 DEG C. to 15 DEG C.,
      preferably 0 DEG to 5 DEG C. With the progress of the reaction,
      the reaction mixture is tinged with purplish red due to the
      production of adrenochrome and its color becomes deeper with
      increasing adrenochrome content. The reaction is continued until
      the absorbance at a wavelength of 495 nm, which is measured by
      sampling the reaction mixture at an appropriate time during the
      reaction, reaches the maximum. Thus, the further oxidation of the
      product adrenochrome can be minimized and adrenochrome can be
      obtained in the maximum yield. The reaction time required for the
      maximum yield generally varies in the range of 30 to 45 minutes,
      depending on the temperature of the reaction mixture and the level
      of catalyst employed. Thus, adrenochrome can be obtained in
      maximum yields in a very short period of time.<br>
      <br>
      After completion of the reaction, adrenochrome is obtained as a
      solution. Adrenochrome is very unstable due to its ortho-quinoid
      structure and, therefore, is usually stabilized by conventional
      derivation with hydrazines, e.g., aminoguanidine, semicarbazide,
      phenylhydrazine, o-nitrophenylhydrazine, p-nitro phenylhydrazine
      and 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine.<br>
      <br>
      Adrenochrome monoaminoguanidine and adrenochrome monosemicarbazone
      are useful as hemostatics and these hydrazine derivatives serve
      both for stabilization of adrenochrome and the preparation of
      useful medicines. Adrenochrome monoaminoguanidine and adrenochrome
      monosemicarbazone obtained utilizing the process of the present
      invention are far less colored than those prepared by the method
      using potassium ferricyanide.<br>
      <br>
      The stabilization of adrenochrome by formation of the hydrazine
      derivative and the isolation of the product may be conducted by
      the following technique. The hydrazine compound, e.g.,
      semicarbazide or aminoguanidine, is added to the reaction mixture
      containing the adrenochrome produced by the process of the
      invention. The hydrazine compound is generally dissolved in water
      in the form of the hydrochloride or sulfate and is added to the
      reaction mixture in one or more portions. The amount of hydrazine
      compound added is generally within the range 1.0 to 1.25 moles per
      mole of adrenochrome. The stabilization treatment is generally
      conducted for 30 minutes to 3 hours at a temperature of 0 DEG to
      15 DEG C. The stabilization is preferably carried out at pH 2 to 5
      when the hydrazine is monoaminoguanidine or pH 5 to 7 when the
      hydrazine is semicarbazide. The optimum pH for the semicarbazide
      stabilization is conveniently achieved by adding a suitable buffer
      to the semicarbazide solution prior to its addition to the
      adrenochrome solution. Suitable buffer salts include those
      previously listed. Potassium acetate is the preferred buffer and
      the amount employed is usually within the range 1.5 to 2.5 mole
      per mole of semicarbazide.<br>
      <br>
      After the completion of the stabilization, the derivative of
      adrenochrome is isolated from the reaction mixture by separating
      the precipitate in a normal manner, e.g., filtration, followed by
      washing. The derivative of adrenochrome is obtained in the form of
      powder. Prior to the separation, the treated reaction mixture may
      be neutralized with an alkali, e.g., sodium hydroxide, to
      precipitate the dissolved adrenochrome derivative. The isolated
      powders may be purified in the usual manner such as active carbon
      treatment, chelate treatment and recrystallization.<br>
      <br>
      The invention will now be illustrated by the following Examples.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 1</b><b><br>
      </b>To a 3-liter beaker was charged distilled water (1000 ml),
      ammonium persulfate (95.8 g; 0.42 mole) and sodium
      hydrogencarbonate (93 g; 1.1 mole). The mixture was stirred and
      cooled to 0 DEG C. To this solution was added a solution of
      bismuth nitrate pentahydrate, Bi(NO3)3.5H2 O, (0.97 g; 0.002 mole
      dissolved in 25 ml 10% HCl). This was followed by the dropwise
      addition of an aqueous solution of adrenaline hydrochloride (44.0
      g; 0.2 mole) dissolved in water (100 ml) over 20 minutes at 0 DEG
      to 5 DEG C. followed by a period of stirring for 30 minutes at 0
      DEG to 5 DEG C. During the reaction, a part of the reaction
      mixture (1 gm) was taken out and was diluted with water to 1000 ml
      and the absorbance of the dilute solution was measured at a
      wavelength of 495 nm. The absorbance increased to a maximum after
      30 to 45 minutes.<br>
      <br>
      To the resulting adrenochrome solution was added a solution of
      semicarbazide hydrochloride (23.6 g; 0.212 mole) and potassium
      acetate (41.2 g; 0.42 mole) dissolved in water (150 ml), over 15
      minutes at below 10 DEG C.<br>
      <br>
      The reaction was stirred for a further 2 hours to allow the
      product to crystallize. The product was collected by filtration,
      washed with water and dried to give 40.0 g crude powder of
      adrenochrome monosemicarbazone. Purification of the adrenochrome
      monosemicarbazone was achieved by suspending the solid in water
      (25 volumes) and treating with an excess of sodium hydroxide to
      afford a solution. After active carbon treatment and addition of
      ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid the purified product was
      precipitated by the addition of acetic acid to pH 5.5. The
      adrenochrome monosemicarbazone was isolated in the conventional
      manner.<br>
      <br>
      The infra-red absorption spectrum and ultraviolet absorption
      spectrum of the purified adrenochrome monosemicarbazone were
      measured. The infra-red absorption spectrum showed the
      characteristic absorptions at 3350, 3190, 1700, 1660, 1560, 1410,
      1295, 1195, 1095, 1060, 810 and 560 cm@-1. The ultra-violet
      absorption spectrum of the purified powder showed maximum
      absorption at 354 nm. The melting point, infra-red absorption
      spectrum and ultra-violet absorption spectrum agreed with those of
      the authentic adrenchrome monosemicarbazone, and the reaction
      product was identified as adrenochrome monosemicarbazone.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 2</b><b><br>
      </b>Adrenochrome was prepared in the same manner as in Example 1.
      To the resulting adrenochrome solution was added an aqueous
      solution of aminoguanidine hydrochloride (23.4 g; 0.212 mole)
      dissolved in water (100 ml) at below 5 DEG C., the pH of the
      resulting solution was adjusted to 2.9 with dilute HCl and stirred
      for a further 30 minutes at below 15 DEG C., during which time a
      deep orange solid precipitated. The pH was further adjusted with
      dilute sodium hydroxide solution to a final pH of 9.0 to 10.0. The
      resulting yellow orange slurry was then stirred for a further 15
      minutes. The product was isolated by filtration, washed and dried
      to give 41.0 g crude powder of adrenochrome monoaminoguanidine.
      The crude powder was dissolved in a 5% by weight aqueous solution
      of sulfurous acid, and after active carbon treatment, a small
      quantity of ethylene diaminetetraacetic acid was added. Four
      percent by weight aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide was then
      added, and the precipitate was separated and washed to give
      purified adrenochrome monoaminoguanidine. The infra-red absorption
      spectrum and ultra-violet absorption spectrum of the purified
      adrenochrome monoaminoguanidine were measured. The infra-red
      absorption spectrum showed the characteristic absorptions at 3330,
      3170, 1640, 1590, 1500, 1395, 1365, 1330, 1295, 1150, 1070, 860,
      815 and 720 cm@-1. The ultra-violet spectrum showed the maxima
      absorption of 348 nm and 445 nm. The infra-red absorption
      spectrum, ultra- violet absorption spectrum and the melting point
      agreed with those of an authentic adrenochrome monoaminoguanidine,
      and the formation of the desired product was thus confirmed.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 3</b><b><br>
      </b>To a 3-liter beaker was charged distilled water (1000 ml),
      ammonium persulfate (95.8 g; 0.42 mole) and sodium
      hydrogencarbonate (93 g; 1.1 mole). The mixture was stirred and
      cooled to 0 DEG C. To this solution was added a solution of
      bismuth oxycarbonate (BiO)2 CO3 (0.5 g; 0.001 mole dissolved in 25
      ml 10% HCl). This was followed by the dropwise addition of an
      aqueous solution of adrenaline hydrochloride (44.0 g; 0.2 mole)
      dissolved in water (100 ml) over 20 minutes at 0 DEG to 5 DEG C.
      followed by a period of stirring for 30 minutes at 0 DEG to 5 DEG
      C.<br>
      <br>
      To the resulting adrenochrome solution was added a solution of
      semicarbazide hydrochloride (23.6 g; 0.212 mole) and potassium
      acetate (41.2 g; 0.42 mole) dissolved in water (150 ml), over 15
      minutes at below 10 DEG C. The reaction was stirred for a further
      2 hours to allow the product to crystallize. The product was
      collected by filtration, washed with water and dried to give 38.3
      g crude powder of adrenochrome monosemicarbazone which slowed the
      characteristic absorptions of 3350, 3190, 1700, 1660, 1560, 1410,
      1295, 1195, 1095, 1060, 810 and 560 cm@-1. The ultra-violet
      absorption spectrum showed a maximum at 354 nm. The infra-red
      absorption spectrum and ultra-violet absorption spectrum agreed
      with those of an authentic sample of adrenochrome
      monosemicarbazone.<br>
      <b><br>
      </b><b>EXAMPLE 4</b><b><br>
      </b>The procedure of Example 3 was repeated except the bismuth
      oxycarbonate was replaced with bismuth citrate C6 H5 BiO7 (0.78 g;
      0.002 mole). Similar results to those obtained in Example 3 were
      obtained.<br>
