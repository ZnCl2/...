      </b><b>Breast milk as a cancer-killer</b><br>
      <br>
      Professor Catharina Svanborg has been paving the road to
      capitalizing on breast milk’s cancer-fighting abilities out of her
      lab at Lund University in Sweden. Specifically, the professor has
      been working on a way to bind a breast milk protein known as
      alpha-lactalbumin to oleic acid, a fatty acid found in olive oil,
      nuts and seeds.<br>
      <br>
      The cancer-killing combination she’s dubbed HAMLET (an acronym for
      human alpha-lactalbumin made lethal to tumor cells) has shown
      great success in laboratory applications, shrinking brain, bladder
      and colon tumors with ease. Tests involving animal and human
      cancer cell lines have shown that HAMLET is effective against at
      least 40 types of cancer.<br>
      <br>
      “Looking down the microscope at the dying tumor cells, we were
      quite excited, especially when the experiment was repeated and
      showed the same effect twice. We had used non-cancerous cells for
      a long time in similar experiments and they had not died,”
      Svanborg told The Telegraph, speaking about the amazing way breast
      milk kills cancer.<br>
      <br>
      But the funny thing is that Svanborg discovered all of this two
      decades ago.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Overcoming skepticism and doubt</b><br>
      <br>
      Svanborg reportedly went onto patent her confirmed discovery in
      1995. She published her research, hoping to take the cancer
      industry by storm with her amazing find. But instead of being met
      with praise and applause, she was simply met with disbelief.<br>
      <br>
      “There was a certain degree of skepticism. It is about being let
      into the cancer community more than anything else,” the professor
      contended. As a university professor and immunologist, Svanborg
      wasn’t considered part of the cancer or pharmaceutical industries
      — and she struggled to have her work taken seriously. As a
      specialist in infectious diseases, and a threat to the
      profit-driven cancer industry, her research on breast milk and
      cancer fell on deaf ears.<br>
      <br>
      But Svanborg was determined and would not be deterred. “One has to
      be stubborn when it is a journey into unchartered territory,” she
      said. For the last 20 years, Svanborg has continued her research
      and continues to turn her skeptics into believers, one by one.<br>
      <br>
      “It is an absolutely thrilling project. If you hang in there, it
      opens up new ways of thinking about protein structure, cell
      biology and the nature of cancer. People are coming around to the
      fact that this is very well supported by in-depth studies,”
      Svanborg contended. The team recently developed a way to mass
      produce HAMLET, which means it could soon become a widely used
      cancer treatment. Her game-changing discovery promises to kill
      cancer cells without damaging health cells — a feat that eludes
      conventional treatments like chemo.<br>
      <br>
      Though HAMLET still has a ways to go before becoming an approved
      form of treatment that’s available to the masses, Svanborg remains
      hopeful....<br>

      In a picturesque medieval town stands the ivy-covered Lund
      University, proudly displaying a historic crest dating back to
      1666.<br>
      <br>
      The exterior of this Swedish institution may exude heritage but
      inside its thick stone walls, pioneering scientists are crossing
      new frontiers in cancer research.<br>
      <br>
      Leading the charge is Professor Catharina Svanborg, who has spent
      the past two decades experimenting with human breast milk.<br>
      <br>
      As unbelievable as it sounds, back in the early Nineties, Svanborg
      and her postgraduate student Anders Håkansson accidently
      discovered that a protein found in breast milk can kill cancer
      cells.<br>
      <br>
      They were experimenting with breast milk to try to understand how
      it was able to fight off germs. A common scientific practice is to
      use human cancer cells in these tests because they behave
      similarly to other human cells and live indefinitely in laboratory
      dishes.<br>
      <br>
      "There was a certain degree of scepticism. It is about being let
      into the cancer community more than anything else"Prof Svanborg<br>
      <br>
      To their surprise, the pair realised that the cancer cells were
      inexplicably disappearing and on closer inspection Svanborg
      realised the breast milk was causing them to "commit suicide".<br>
      <br>
      "Looking down the microscope at the dying tumor cells, we were
      quite excited, especially when the experiment was repeated and
      showed the same effect twice. We had used non cancerous cells for
      a long time in similar experiments and they had not died," she
      explains.<br>
      <br>
      Further in vitro experiments confirmed that when human milk
      protein (called alpha-lactalbumin) binds to a fatty acid it
      creates a unique tumour-killing protein-lipid complex that has the
      ability to destroy cancer cells. It rapidly shrinks the most
      aggressive type of invasive brain tumour as well as bladder cancer
      and colon cancer tumours.<br>
      <br>
      Svanborg named this Hamlet (Human alpha-lactalbumin made lethal to
      tumour cells) and patented the discovery. She then set about
      informing the scientific world and published her first research
      paper in one of the most-cited multidisciplinary scientific
      journals, the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science, in
      1995.<br>
      <br>
      But instead of being met with worldwide acclaim, Svanborg and her
      associates were met with disbelief.<br>
      <br>
      As an immunologist working in a university, Svanborg was not part
      of the cancer research and pharmaceutical development community,
      and initially struggled to have her research taken seriously.<br>
      <br>
      Her expertise in infectious disease, rather than cancer research,
      meant that Svanborg had less clout - particularly as she was
      challenging the current dogma.<br>
      <br>
      Back in 1999, David Salomon - a cancer researcher at the National
      Cancer Institute in America - told Discovery magazine that if
      Svanborg's research had come from a well known laboratory,
      journalists would be calling "six days to Sunday. You’d have
      scientists eager to collaborate. But it’s coming from a small lab
      in a foreign country. It’s like General Motors versus a garage
      operation.”<br>
      <br>
      It's something Svanborg is all too aware of. "There was a certain
      degree of scepticism" she says, choosing her words carefully. "It
      is about being let into the cancer community more than anything
      else.<br>
      <br>
      "A common response I’d get would be 'we don't get it, but we can't
      fault the research'," says Svanborg.<br>
      <br>
      Undeterred, she doggedly set off to "take the tiger by the tail"
      and prove her discovery was legitimate: "One has to be stubborn
      when it is a journey into unchartered territory".<br>
      <br>
      So, for the past 20 years, she has been doing just that - breaking
      new ground and slowly winning over the sceptics by building up a
      wealth of conclusive scientific data. Her small team of around a
      dozen scientists have been testing Hamlet on animals and humans,
      showing time and again that it can kill over 40 cancers but leaves
      healthy cells unharmed.<br>
      <br>
      Tests on mice revealed that Hamlet limited the development of
      brain tumours and bladder cancer. It also prevented the
      development of colon cancer in baby mice, when given in their
      drinking water, suggesting that it might also be developed to
      prevent tumour development in genetically susceptible individuals.<br>
      <br>
      In one human test, nine bladder cancer patients were administered
      five daily doses of Hamlet via a catheter in the week preceding
      surgery to remove their tumour. Eight out of the nine started
      passing tumours cells in their urine just two hours after being
      given it, and their tumour reduced in size or character. Adjacent
      healthy tissue showed no sign of toxicity.<br>
      <br>
      These types of breakthroughs have kept Svanborg determined to get
      her treatment onto the market. She has used the years judiciously
      to amass a convincing body of data, including scores of articles
      in prestigious science journals such as The International Journal
      of Cancer, Oncogene, Experimental Cell Research and Molecular
      Microbiology.<br>
      "This is a game-changing discovery for potential cancer treatments
      for the future"Prof Svanborg<br>
      <br>
      She remains excited as ever about the research: "It is an
      absolutely thrilling project. If you hang in there, it opens up
      new ways of thinking about protein structure, cell biology and the
      nature of cancer. People are coming around to the fact that this
      is very well supported by in depth studies."<br>
      <br>
      Indeed other researchers, such as assistant professor Dagmar
      Zweytick at the University of Graz in Austria, are now
      experimenting with similar techniques using different breast milk
      molecules to treat cancer cells in the lab. However their research
      is in its infancy with only three publications to date.<br>
      <br>
      With the cancer research community starting to thaw, Svanborg was
      in a better position than ever to reveal her latest findings at
      the Medela breastfeeding and lactation symposium in Florence,
      Italy last week.<br>
      <br>
      Her team has finally discovered how to mass produce a synthetic
      form of Hamlet, meaning it is now ready to be developed into a new
      cancer treatment drug.<br>
      <br>
      “Who would have thought that breast milk had the potential to kill
      cancer cells?” said Dr. Leon Mitoulas, scientific director of the
      symposium.<br>
      <br>
      “We are truly on the cusp of a golden age for research in human
      milk. It is an infinitely complex fluid, and intensive,
      multidisciplinary studies, utilising cutting-edge techniques, have
      only been employed in this field the past decade."<br>
      <br>
      Talking from her hotel room in Florence, an elated Svanborg
      explains why this innovation is so important.<br>
      <br>
      "Hamlet is ready to become a new drug. We have all the things
      ready but we are now proceeding with all the necessary steps,
      tests and clinical trials all working towards the goals to create
      a new cancer therapy."<br>
      <br>
      These large scale clinical trials will be tested on colon, bladder
      and cervical cancer - as well as other forms that have been
      historically difficult to cure.<br>
      <br>
      Although there are currently many effective cancer treatments
      available, what makes Hamlet unique is its ability to target
      specific tumours, with apparently little or no side effects.<br>
      <br>
      Unlike chemotherapy and radiotherapy - which destroy some healthy
      cells causing side effects such as nerve damage, loss of hair and
      nausea - it is seemingly not toxic to healthy cells.<br>
      <br>
      "This is a game-changing discovery for potential cancer treatments
      for the future. To have been leading this project is something
      that I am very proud of and I am entirely grateful to all my team
      members, who have been working tirelessly, to get where we are
      today – in a position of being ready to create a new drug," said
      Svanborg.<br>
      <br>
      But the journey is far from over. Hamlet still needs investment
      from "big pharma" to become available to the public and Svanborg
      won't be drawn on how many years this could take.<br>
      <br>
      “We are not yet able to say when it will be fully tested,
      approved, and produced as a cancer therapy drug, but we are
      working very hard towards the goal that Hamlet will be available
      for patients who need alternative therapies."<br>
      <br>
      And leading research institutions still remain cautious. Dr
      Justine Alford, Cancer Research UK’s senior science information
      officer, said: “This research doesn’t provide any evidence that
      breast milk has any cancer-fighting properties.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      "We’re years away from knowing whether the drug is better than
      existing treatments and we’ll need to wait for results from larger
      clinical trials to find out"Dr Justine Alford, Cancer Research UK<br>
      <br>
      “Research has shown that a man-made version of a molecule found in
      breast milk has some positive effects treating mice with cancer,
      and early clinical trial results show that the drug is safe for
      people to take.<br>
      <br>
      “But we’re years away from knowing whether the drug is better than
      existing treatments and we’ll need to wait for results from larger
      clinical trials to find this out.<br>
      <br>
      “Developing a new cancer treatment can take a long time, because
      all new drugs have to be rigorously tested to make sure they are
      safe and stand a good chance of working before they are tested in
      people.”<br>
      <br>
      Committed as ever and convinced of the importance of her
      discovery, Svanborg is now putting everything in place to hand the
      Hamlet baton onto a drug development company.<br>
      <br>
      Like the mother of an extraordinary child - albeit an accidental
      one - she is now preparing for her baby to leave the nest.<br>
      <br>
      But despite all her emotional and professional investment in the
      project&nbsp; if Hamlet does make it onto the market Svanborg
      refuses to profit from it financially.<br>
      <br>
      She says, "The team have all agreed if we ever make money it will
      go into a research foundation to channel it back into society."<br>

        <br>
        <i>Breast-feeding protects babies from cancer, but no one knows
          quite how. So when biologists in Catharina Svanborg's lab saw
          mothers' milk kill cancer cells, they knew they were onto
          something big.</i><i><br>
        </i><br>
        <b>By Peter Radetsky, Thomas Wester</b></div>
      <br>
      When Catharina Svanborg and her research associates began mixing
      mothers' milk and cancer cells together seven years ago, she
      wasn't looking for a cure for cancer; she was after a way to fight
      germs. Nevertheless, the physician and immunologist at Lund
      University in Sweden has discovered that a previously
      taken-for-granted component of ordinary human breast milk compels
      cancer cells -- every type of cancer cell tested -- to die. Now
      Svanborg must prove her discovery, demonstrating to wary
      scientists that her surprising find is for real. So far, it hasn't
      been easy.<br>
      <br>
      “It’s an extremely important observation, interesting and
      provocative,” says breast cancer researcher David Salomon of the
      National Cancer Institute. “But it’s novel, and novelty always
      runs the risk of challenging the current dogma. A lot of times you
      run up against a brick wall of people who have tunnel vision.”<br>
      <br>
      It doesn’t help that Svanborg’s lab is not a large, high-profile
      cancer research facility. In fact, it’s not a cancer lab at all;
      her specialty is an entirely different field, infectious disease.
      Says Salomon: “If this work had come from a well-known lab at the
      NCI, you’d have reporters calling six days to Sunday. You’d have
      scientists eager to collaborate. But it’s coming from a small lab
      in a foreign country. It’s like General Motors versus a garage
      operation.”<br>
      <br>
      If so, this is the kind of garage you’d take your Porsche to.
      Tall, poised, and professional to the core, Svanborg leads a team
      of dedicated young researchers who have worked overtime to make
      their discovery matter. With the first phase of research finally
      finished, the group has decided to launch a fusillade of papers to
      scientific journals. Soon skeptics may have a tough time denying
      that they are onto something big.<br>
      <br>
      Lund is dark and bleak in winter. A medieval town of 95,000 people
      (almost half are students), it nestles into Sweden’s southern tip.
      At its heart stands a twelfth-century cathedral with Romanesque
      towers that disappear into the gloomy low mist. As an occasional
      vehicle slowly skirts the town’s commons, bundled bicyclists glide
      by silently. People hunch forward against the cold. Across the
      way, university halls from the seventeenth century proclaim in
      stone Lund’s role as Scandinavia’s historical center of learning.<br>
      <br>
      So it is a surprise, away from the town center, to come suddenly
      upon modern brick and concrete buildings: the university hospital,
      the library, science classrooms, laboratories. It was here nearly
      seven years ago that her student Anders Håkansson rushed into
      Svanborg’s office with perplexing news. He had been experimenting
      with human cancer cells, microbes, and mothers’ milk. (Like lab
      mice, cancer cells make popular experimental models because they
      come in standardized lab strains. In many important respects they
      behave just like other human cells, and they live indefinitely in
      lab dishes.) The idea was to pinpoint how the milk, a terrific
      germ-fighter, blocks bacteria from infecting other cells. But the
      cancer cells in this experiment were acting up. “Their volume was
      decreasing,” Håkansson recalls. “Their nuclei were shrinking.
      Something was wrong.”<br>
      <br>
      When Svanborg sat down at the microscope, she diagnosed the
      problem immediately. “The cancer cells,” she announced in her
      calm, deliberate manner, “are committing suicide.”<br>
      <br>
      Cells commit suicide all the time, a phenomenon called apoptosis,
      in which the body rids itself of old or unnecessary cells (see
      “Apoptosis,” on page 73). They simply fall apart and are recycled.
      For cancer cells, however, suicide is rare indeed. Their defining
      characteristic is uncontrolled reproduction. Yet somehow, the
      breast milk induced these cancer cells to take their own lives.<br>
      <br>
      The circumstance opened up an enormous vista of mysteries—which
      pleased Svanborg to no end. “Discovery is at the heart of science.
      If you ask me for specific goals, I wouldn’t be able to name them.
      The process is fascinating enough.” Svanborg was eager to dive
      into finding out what in mothers’ milk was killing the cancer
      cells.<br>
      <br>
      “And I always hope that new information will be practical and
      useful for people who need it,” she adds, the physician rising to
      the fore. Discerning the basic mechanism wasn’t enough—Svanborg
      wanted to find out if the cells might be induced to commit suicide
      on demand: Could the discovery be developed into a cancer cure?<br>
      <br>
      Attempting to do so would require manpower, and fewer than 20
      people worked in Svanborg’s lab. Most were already involved in
      their own projects targeting infectious diseases. “If this were a
      pharmaceutical company, you could say, ‘Take a bunch of people and
      move them to this,’” Svanborg says. “But this is a university.
      These are students. If they already have thesis projects going,
      you can’t change their focus just like that.”<br>
      <br>
      “You have freedom here,” says a graduate student. “Although we’re
      still in training, we are working as scientists. Catharina is very
      good at giving feedback, but we get to decide what experiments to
      do and how to do them.”<br>
      <br>
      Which is also the way their professor likes it: “I want to
      facilitate creative environments. I like encouraging people to
      contribute based on who they are and what they think. After all,
      this cancer find is pure serendipity. And serendipity arises when
      people are in a situation that fosters creativity. Nobody can
      define how it happens, but there’s a lot of happiness involved.”
      So when Svanborg decided to go after the cancer, she couldn’t just
      pull her colleagues from their projects to help her. The
      undertaking would largely fall to her and Håkansson alone.<br>
