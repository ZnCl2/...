      <b>FACTORIAL HOMOEOPATHIC PROCESS</b><b><br>
      </b><b>WO2017195215 </b><b><br>
      </b>The present invention provides a factorial homeopathy process
      of trituration/succussion for transferring energy to a raw
      material without using any bland material. The process transfers
      energy so that molecules of the raw material achieve higher levels
      of activation and become easy to absorb by the living organisms.<br>
      <br>
      <b>DISCUSSION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [004] Hahnemann conceived the concept of succussion in
      Homoeopathy. The raw material is diluted in water, alcohol,
      mixture of both or in lactose (known as vehicle). The shaking of
      raw material is performed with definite proportions of select
      vehicle for a predefined number of times or minutes to achieve
      higher potency. [005] In Homeopathy, Potentisation is a well known
      process of making a raw material more potent by triturating and
      succession. The raw material is usually diluted with a bland
      material (also known as vehicle) such as alcohol or distilled
      water, and then followed by shaking in a specific method according
      to Pharmacopoeia. Alcohol is usually preferred; except in cases
      where the raw material is only soluble in water. The process is
      generally followed to transfer energy to raw material for
      achieving high levels of activation that are easy to absorb by
      living organisms.<br>
      <br>
      [006] Potentisation results in reduction of raw material to a
      state of approximately perfect solution. In other words,
      potentisation is a process to reduce a material to the finest
      possible state, and thereby transferring energy to the chemically
      bonded electrons in the raw materials molecules to achieve higher
      states of stable existence.<br>
      <br>
      [007] Trituration means grinding of raw material in a pestle,
      mortar, and any other machinery that can be used for the same
      purpose. One such apparatus, disclosed in the US patent 4061276,
      reduces particle size of raw material by the process of collision
      of material in a rotating bowl.<br>
      <br>
      [008] The process of succussion or trituration is very widely used
      in the homeopathy for achieving the high potency of the mother
      tincture. Since energy is transferred to raw material during the
      process, the raw material becomes more effective. However, the
      process does not provide factorial potency of the drug. [009]
      Moreover, edible materials, manufactured using homoeopathy
      process, are not available in the market that can be used for
      living organism having weak digestive system.<br>
      <br>
      <b>DESCRIPTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [010] While reading this section (An Exemplary Embodiment, which
      describes the exemplary embodiment of the best mode of the
      invention, hereinafter referred to as "exemplary embodiment"), one
      should consider the exemplary embodiment as the best mode for
      practicing the invention during filing of the patent in accordance
      with the inventor's belief. As person with ordinary skills in the
      art may recognize substantially equivalent structures or
      substantially equivalent acts to achieve the same results in the
      same manner, or in a dissimilar manner, the exemplary embodiment
      should not be interpreted as limiting the invention to one
      embodiment.<br>
      <br>
      [011]The discussion of a species (or a specific item) invokes the
      genus (the class of items) to which the species belongs as well as
      related species in this genus. Similarly, the recitation of a
      genus invokes the species known in the art. Furthermore, as
      technology develops, numerous additional alternatives to achieve
      an aspect of the invention may arise. Such advances are
      incorporated within their respective genus and should be
      recognized as being functionally equivalent or structurally
      equivalent to the aspect shown or described. A function or an act
      should be interpreted as incorporating all modes of performing the
      function or act, unless otherwise explicitly stated. For instance,
      Triturate means to rub, crush, grind, or pound into fine particles
      or a powder; pulverize. Therefore, the use of the word
      "trituration" invokes "rub" or "crush" and all other modes of this
      word and similar words such as "grind".<br>
      <br>
      [012]Unless explicitly stated otherwise, conjunctive words (such
      as "or", "and", "including" or "comprising") should be interpreted
      in the inclusive, and not the exclusive sense.<br>
      <br>
      [013]The foregoing discussions and definitions are provided for
      clarification purposes and are not limiting. Words and phrases are
      to be accorded their ordinary, plain meaning, unless indicated
      otherwise.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EMBODIMENT DISCUSSION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [014] In the process, the raw material is added repeatedly instead
      of bland material or vehicle during the trituration/succussion
      process and a product with all level of potency (Q,1X, 2X, 3X, 4X,
      5X, 6X) can be manufactured when the process is repeated six times
      for transfer of energy. The process is valid for all type of
      notations like decimal/centesimaletc.<br>
      <br>
      [015] In one embodiment, raw material is taken without any
      dilution and triturated. The process of manufacturing product
      would be - a) add two parts by weight of raw material are taken;
      b) triturate thoroughly for a predefined time; c) stir
      continuously for a predefined time; d) follow steps b) and c) in
      same sequence; e) add four parts of raw material; f) follow steps
      b), c) and d); g) add four part of raw material; h) follow steps
      b), c) and d). The raw material can be selected based on the
      product to be manufactured.<br>
      <br>
      [016] In another embodiment, the process is further repeated while
      adding the same raw material to achieve higher factorial potency.
      The final product will contain all the power from q to highest
      potency.<br>
      <br>
      [017] The pure 6X of the product (continuous trituturation without
      adding any further material) can be subjected to laboratory tests
      like coulombs meter, spectroscopy or nuclear magnetic resonance to
      verify the results.<br>
      <br>
      [018] In an alternative embodiment, the method can be applied to
      liquid, solid and/or semi-solids.<br>
      <br>
      [019] The objective of trituration process is to reduce material
      size to the finest possible stable state and thereby transferring
      energy to chemically bonded electrons of molecule of the raw
      material for achieving higher states of stability. The valence
      electron of molecules of the raw material would absorb energy
      primarily. The energy is then transferred to living organism when
      consumed, i.e. the molecules emit the previously absorbed energy
      (like fraunhofer lines in spectroscopy) with the resultant emitted
      quanta/packet (bunch of frequencies) being typical of the
      particular remedy.<br>
      <br>
      [020] Although any suitable equipment can be used for trituration;
      the resultant product shall not be exposed to contact with metal
      to retain energy in the product intact. Therefore, equipment shall
      be designed in such a way that it does not allow any such contact.<br>
      <br>
      [021] In accordance with embodiments of the present invention, the
      process starts with trituration and stirring of 100 grams of
      calcium carbonate. Trituration and stirring is continued till
      potentisation of IX is achieved. After an hour of potentisation,
      8.3 grams of twelve biochemic salts are added to 100 grams of IX
      calcium carbonate is added and process of trituration is continued
      till 3X factorial potentisation is achieved. Thereafter, a mixture
      of supari, yaks milk and cheese granules soaked in ocirnum sanctum
      and syzgayzium aromaticum is added to the processed calcium
      carbonate in the ratio of 15-20% by weight.<br>
      <br>
      [022] In accordance with embodiments of the present invention,
      fish meal and calcium carbonate are added in equal proportion and
      triturated till factorial homeopathy potentisation of 3X is
      achieved. Other feed materials like maize can be added followed by
      trituration of at least 6 hours to produce highly digestible food
      stuff.<br>
      <br>
      [023] The process described in the present invention is not
      restricted to abovementioned examples. It can be used to
      manufacture all edible stuff, pharmaceuticals, veterinary and aqua
      culture feeds and chemicals, fertilizers, fragrances, pesticides,
      detergents, mouth fresheners, or any stuff that living organisms
      consume. By using the process, any stuff can be made more
      effective as it would possess better absorption and digestive
      properties.<br>

      <b>METHOD FOR PRODUCTION OF SOLID WATER PARTICLES FOR HOMEOPATHY</b><b><br>
      </b><b>US2015335740 </b><b><br>
      </b>A method for production of solid water particles for
      homeopathy uses principles of quantum physics to from a
      concentrated solid water particle solution. A homeopathic
      ingredient solution is diluted in purified water in an inert gas
      environment. The dilution occurs as infinitesimal doses, in which
      the solution is repetitively diluted in water past the point where
      few molecules from the solution remain. An electrical field is
      applied to align the water molecules for formation of a large
      clump of solid water particles. Alternating phases of ultrasonic
      vibrations break down the large clump into small clusters of solid
      water particles. The vibration is followed by periods of rest,
      whereby the small clusters grow into successively larger clumps by
      absorbing water molecules. The vibrations and resting are repeated
      in cycles until a desired concentration of solid water particles
      form in the solid water particle solution.<br>

      having irritation to a tissue (e.g. a physiological saline,
      distilled water or a purified whey) is used to prepare a solution
      and produce the first homeopathic mother liquor. The resultant
      mother liquor is then introduced into a composite mammary gland
      tissue of ungulates (preferably cattle) and the raw material
      solution is subsequently converted to the second mother liquor
      having characteristics of a sarcode and the homeopathy of the

      </b><b>GR1004816</b><b><br>
      </b>The invention relates to a method of transferring frequencies
      containing various crystals to substances such as water, polar
      dyalizers, creams and binding substances used for the production
      of cosmetics and pharmaceutical preparations containing same
      frequencies. The innovation of the invention consists in the use
      of crystals employed as resonance material and frequencies filter
      and in the transfer and registering of frequencies on substrates
      such as water. The perfect geometrical nature of thecrystal
      guaranties the stability of the information transferred to the
      substrates chiefly to water. In this manner, the introduction of
      frequencies into the human organism is not carried out by means of
      electrodes but by direct introduction of the precise substrate
      (water) in the human organism. Through the herein described
      method, the invention allows the production of water carrying
      information about basic homeopathetical substances so that a novel
      more liable homeopathy is created. Said frequencies transferred,
      for instance, by means of water to the human organism have a
      direct impact to the brain imposing a functional frequency by
