          Could Be a New Agricultural Tool</b><br>
      </div>
      <b><br>
      </b><b>Summary</b><b><br>
      </b>Scientists have identified a plant hormone, beta-cyclocitral,
      that makes tomato and rice plant roots grow faster and branch
      more. The hormone could help farmers enhance crop plant growth.<br>
      <br>
      A molecule sold as a food additive has an underground role, too:
      helping roots grow faster.<br>
      <br>
      When added to soil, the molecule, called beta-cyclocitral, speeds
      root growth in rice and tomato plants, scientists report May 8,
      2019, in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of
      Sciences. It also makes rice plants resistant to salty soil, which
      usually turns plants sickly and stunted. The molecule, a hormone
      found naturally in plants, could be a useful tool for farmers
      seeking healthier and more drought-resistant crops.<br>
      <br>
      For centuries, plants have been bred for vigorous foliage and
      other easily visible traits. Because roots are hidden underground,
      “they’ve been largely ignored,” says developmental biologist
      Philip Benfey, a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator at
      Duke University.<br>
      <br>
      And yet, roots make up half the plant, points out coauthor Jazz
      Dickinson, also at Duke. She and Benfey wanted to find plant
      hormones that affected root development. Their previous research
      had hinted that some molecule chemically related to carotenoids –
      the pigments that give carrots their vibrant orange hue – might be
      important. But the researchers weren’t sure exactly which one,
      Dickinson says.<br>
      <br>
      Many of these carotenoid relatives have been repurposed and are
      available commercially as food additives or dietary supplements.
      Dickinson rounded up about 20 and tested their effects on a common
      lab plant, Arabidopsis. She added each compound to the clear agar
      gel in which the plants were growing – a setup that let her easily
      see the roots – and monitored what happened over 10 days.<br>
      <br>
      “Beta-cyclocitral stood out,” she says. It made the roots grow
      faster and also branch out more. And it had the same effect in
      rice and tomato plants, follow-up tests showed.<br>
      <br>
      In rice plants, the team noticed an even more striking effect: the
      plants could also withstand salty soil. Irrigation of farm fields
      can make soil saltier, especially near the top. The team mimicked
      those conditions in the lab, and then watched how rice plants
      grew. “Untreated rice plants were very unhappy with that level of
      salt,” Benfey says. But with beta-cyclocitral added, the plants
      didn’t seem perturbed.<br>
      <br>
      It’s possible that the compound helped the roots push down through
      the salty topsoil to reach the deeper, less-salty soil more
      quickly, Dickinson proposes.<br>
      <br>
      The researchers hope that beta-cyclocitral will be useful
      agriculturally, either added to soil or sprayed onto crops. And
      since the molecule worked in both rice and tomatoes – two very
      different plants – it may boost root growth in crops more broadly.<br>

      These racing roots show the effects of beta-cyclocitrical, a plant
      hormone that boosts root growth. The rice plants on the left are
      growing in a gel that contains the hormone, but the ones on the

      </b><b>Significance</b><b><br>
      </b>Roots produce hundreds to thousands of small molecules with
      unknown functions. We targeted the apocarotenoid pathway, which
      has been linked to numerous developmental processes in
      Arabidopsis, for a sensitized chemical genetic screen to identify
      regulators of root development. ß-Cyclocitral, a small molecule
      derived from ß-carotene, was identified as a regulator of root
      stem cell behavior in Arabidopsis as well as in rice and tomato.
      ß-Cyclocitral promotes root stem cell divisions to enhance root
      growth and branching. In rice, ß-cyclocitral enhanced both root
      and shoot growth during salt stress, which has important
      implications for agriculture.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b>Natural compounds capable of increasing root depth and
      branching are desirable tools for enhancing stress tolerance in
      crops. We devised a sensitized screen to identify natural
      metabolites capable of regulating root traits in Arabidopsis.
      ß-Cyclocitral, an endogenous root compound, was found to promote
      cell divisions in root meristems and stimulate lateral root
      branching. ß-Cyclocitral rescued meristematic cell divisions in
      ccd1ccd4 biosynthesis mutants, and ß-cyclocitral–driven root
      growth was found to be independent of auxin, brassinosteroid, and
      reactive oxygen species signaling pathways. ß-Cyclocitral had a
      conserved effect on root growth in tomato and rice and generated
      significantly more compact crown root systems in rice. Moreover,
      ß-cyclocitral treatment enhanced plant vigor in rice plants
      exposed to salt-contaminated soil. These results indicate that
      ß-cyclocitral is a broadly effective root growth promoter in both
      monocots and eudicots and could be a valuable tool to enhance crop
      vigor under environmental stress.<br>

      </b><b>GB189823254</b><b><br>
      </b>Ionone is prepared from citral and acetone by the following
      operations :-(1) Cyclocitral is first produced. For this purpose
      citral is condensed with cyanacetic acid, or a salt or ether
      thereof, in the presence of caustic soda' and alcohol, whereby
      citralidene cyanacetic acid melting at 124 -122 C., or a
      derivative thereof, is produced ; then this product is converted
      into its cyclic isomeride by boiling it at a reflux-cooler with
      diluted sulphuric acid for twelve hours, after the manner
      described in Specification No. 22,114, A.D. 1893; and, finally,
      the cyclic compound, which after removal of bye-products is
      obtained as a syrup, is distilled in a powerful current of steam
      in presence of caustic alkali, and the distillate is fractionated
      to obtain crude cyclocitral as a yellowish liquid boiling at 80
      -110 C. under a pressure of 15 mm. The cyclocitralidene cyanacetio
      acid may also be hydrolysed by boiling it with caustic potash
      solution and xylene, and then separating and fractionating the
      xylene layer. A small quantity of a gentle oxidizing- agent, such
      as lead peroxide or the like, may advantageously be used in these
      hydrolysing operations. (2) Cyclocitral is condensed with acetone
      by means of alkaline reagents, for example, a solution of sodium
      in alcohol, at the ordinary temperature. The mixture is then
      neutralized by tartaric or other acid, and is distilled in a
      strong current of steam. On redistillation the fraction which
      boils at 130 -140 C., under a pressure of 16 mm., is collected as
      ionone. It is rich in #-ionone, and yields a semi-earbazone
      melting at 148 C., and a p-bromophenyl-hydrazone melting at 116 C.<br>

      </b>Compounds of the formula where R is H or CH 3 are prepared by

      of #-ionone or #-isone in a solvent for ozonolysis reactions in an
      amount to provide 1 to 2 moles 03 per mole of #-ionone or #-isone
      and the resulting reaction mixture is worked up hydrolytically or
