          Light Water For Its Citizens' Thirst</b><br>

        <b>January 6, 2011</b><br>

      <br>
      <b> </b>In an effort to produce mass quantities of healthier H2O,
      Chinese scientists have come up with a new method to change
      water's chemical composition. It involves making light water.<br>
      <br>
      Natural water has tiny amounts of D2O molecules, deuterium and
      oxygen, mixed in with the dihydrogen monoxide. Deuterium, also
      called heavy hydrogen, is an isotope of hydrogen that contains one
      proton and one neutron. In North America, typical drinking water
      has a deuterium concentration of about 150 ppm, roughly equivalent
      to a few drops per every quart.<br>
      <br>
      Water with higher concentrations of D2O is known as heavy water,
      and it is harmful to plants and animals. By contrast, water with
      hardly any D2O - or light water - can boost the immune system and
      benefit plant and animal health, according to several studies. In
      one study from 2003, plant photosynthesis increased with the use
      of light water. A study involving mice blasted with ionizing
      radiation showed a dramatic difference in survival between mice
      that drank light water and mice that drank regular water. It is
      even used as a cancer treatment for humans: In 2008, researchers
      reported that light water noticeably lengthened the lifespan of
      terminal cancer patients.<br>
      <br>
      Given these positive effects, it seems smart to provide greater
      quantities of light water for public consumption. But it's hard to
      produce - current methods include electrolysis, distillation, a
      high-temperature exchange method that uses hydrogen sulfide, and
      desalination from seawater, according to authors Feng Huang and
      Changgong Meng of the Department of Chemistry at Dalian University
      of Technology in China. These methods are either expensive,
      inefficient or bad for the environment.<br>
      <br>
      The authors propose a new method involving a platinum catalyst,
      which quickly removes deuterium from water using cold and hot
      temperatures, according to the American Chemical Society. The
      result is water with a deuterium concentration of roughly 125 ppm.<br>
      <br>
      The method could be the basis for industrial-scale light water
      production - and a new way to produce huge quantities of healthier
      water for the masses.<br>

      While this article does provide links to the astounding research
      conducted by a few different groups, all of the experiments
      reported have been conducted using deuterium-depleted water only.
      The most remarkable evidence of cellular regeneration will soon be
      obtained using pure lightwater, comprised of 0% deuterium and 100%
      protium, as described in various aspects throughout this author's
      latest book, Lightwater [ @ <a

      </a>]<br>
      <br>
      Highly advanced technological information provided during many
      well-reported contacts by extraterrestrial visitors are elucidated
      throughout each chapter of the book, which, taken altogther,
      provide a holistic framework for understanding the anti-aging
      effects of drinking lightwater with traces of gold and silver
      nanoparticles, and exposing the human body to electrical current.
      The most intense examples are given by contactees who have been
      enveloped in HHO plasma and experienced the resulting transcendent

      <div align="center"><b>New method for making large quantities of
          deuterium-depleted drinking water </b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Scientists in China are reporting development of a less expensive,
      more eco-friendly method for making deuterium-depleted drinking
      water, citing studies suggesting that it may be a more healthful
      form of water. Their report appears in ACS' bi-weekly journal
      Industrial &amp; Engineering Chemistry Research.<br>
      <br>
      Changgong Meng and Feng Huang note that natural water, widely
      known as H2O, actually is a mixture of H2O and tiny amounts of D2O
      -- about 150 parts per million (ppm), or a few drops of D2O in
      every quart of water. Deuterium-depleted water usually contains
      about 125 ppm. The "D" is deuterium, an isotope or variant form of
      hydrogen often termed "heavy hydrogen." They cite accumulating
      evidence that water with high levels of deuterium may have adverse
      health effects on animals and plants, while deuterium-depleted
      water may be useful in treatment of certain diseases. Existing
      ways of removing deuterium from water tend to be expensive,
      inefficient, or environmentally harmful.<br>
      <br>
      They describe a new method that helps overcome these problems, and
      could be the basis for the first industrial-scale production of
      deuterium-depleted water. It involves a platinum catalyst that
      quickly and efficiently removes deuterium from water using a
      combination of cold and hot temperatures. In laboratory-scale
      tests, the new technique reduced the amount of deuterium in water
      from about 145 parts per million to 125 parts per million. The
      resulting water is suitable for drinking, the scientists say, and
      could be produced in large quantities at economical cost.<br>

      <b>Abstract</b><br>
      <b> </b>A study of the utilization of dual-temperature catalytic
      exchange between water and hydrogen for the production of
      deuterium-depleted water is presented. We use a novel catalyst
      with excellent physical properties for the hot tower of the
      isotopic exchange. The deuterium-depleted water obtained from the
      experiment is in agreement with the theoretical consideration on
      deuterium content at 80 °C when λ is about 1.5. The
      deuterium-depleted water with 126.3 ppm D2O is gained when λ is
      about 2 under 80 °C. This kind of water can be used as ordinary
      drinking water and in cosmetic and hygiene products.<br>

          of deuterium depleted water consumption on 4 patients with
          brain metastases from lung cancer.</b><br>
        <b>Krempels K, et al.</b><br>
      </div>
      <b>Abstract</b><br>
      <b> HYPOTHESES:</b><br>
      <b> </b>Because of the number of sufferers and high mortality
      rate, the standard care and new therapeutic options in the
      treatment of brain metastasis from lung cancer are the subject of
      intense research. A new concept based on the different chemical
      and physical behavior of protium and deuterium affecting cell
      signaling and tumor growth has been introduced in the treatment of
      cancer patients. The aim of this study was to investigate the
      impact of deuterium depleted water (DDW) consumption in addition
      to conventional forms of therapy on the survival of lung cancer
      patients with brain metastasis.<br>
      <br>
      <b> STUDY DESIGN:</b><br>
      <b> </b>A series of 4 case histories was retrospectively
      evaluated. The patients were diagnosed with brain metastasis
      deriving from a primary lung tumor and started consuming DDW at
      the time of or after the diagnosis of the brain metastasis, which
      was inoperable or the surgical intervention did not result in
      complete regression. The primary objective was survival.<br>
      <br>
      <b> METHODS:</b><br>
      <b> </b>The daily water intake of the patients was replaced with
      DDW, which complemented the conventional forms of treatment.
      Patients were consuming DDW for at least 3 months. The treatment
      was continued with DDW of 10 to 15 to 20 ppm lower deuterium (D)
      content every 1 to 2 months and thus a gradual decrease was
      maintained in the D-concentration in the patient's body.<br>
      <br>
      <b> RESULTS:</b><br>
      <b> </b>DDW consumption integrated into conventional treatments
      resulted in a survival time of 26.6, 54.6, 21.9, and 33.4 months
      in the 4 patients, respectively. The brain metastasis of 2
      patients showed complete response (CR), whereas partial response
      (PR) was detected in 1 patient, and the tumor growth was halted
      (no change or NC) in 1 case. The primary tumor of 2 patients
      indicated CR, and the lung tumor in 2 patients showed PR.<br>
      <br>
      <b> CONCLUSIONS:</b><br>
      <b> </b>DDW was administered as an oral anticancer agent in
      addition to conventional therapy, and noticeably prolonged the
      survival time of all 4 lung cancer patients with brain metastasis.
      We suggest that DDW treatment, when integrated into other forms of
      cancer treatment, might provide a new therapeutic option.<br>

      <b>Abstract</b><br>
      <b> </b>The invention discloses a water treatment method for
      removing deuterium oxide. The method comprises the following
      steps: a, primarily filtering water to be treated; b, carrying out
      flow distribution treatment on the primarily filtered flowing
      water to form an ultrathin film waterfall state; c, cooling the

      deuterium oxide iced and light water not iced; and d, performing
      filtration, and collecting the iced and solidified deuterium oxide
      to finally obtain high-quality light water. The icing temperature
      of the deuterium-free light water is different from that of the
      deuterium oxide, and the deuterium oxide with a high icing
      temperature is condensed and separated by a cooling icing process
      to obtain the high-purity light water, sothe method has the
      advantages of very low cost and very high production efficiency.<br>
