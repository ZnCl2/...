      <div align="center"><b>Coconut oil could combat tooth decay</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Digested coconut oil is able to attack the bacteria that cause
      tooth decay. It is a natural antibiotic that could be incorporated
      into commercial dental care products, say scientists presenting
      their work at the Society for General Microbiology's Autumn
      Conference at the University of Warwick.<br>
      <br>
      The team from the Athlone Institute of Technology in Ireland
      tested the antibacterial action of coconut oil in its natural
      state and coconut oil that had been treated with enzymes, in a
      process similar to digestion. The oils were tested against strains
      of Streptococcus bacteria which are common inhabitants of the
      mouth. They found that enzyme-modified coconut oil strongly
      inhibited the growth of most strains of Streptococcus bacteria
      including Streptococcus mutans - an acid-producing bacterium that
      is a major cause of tooth decay.<br>
      <br>
      Many previous studies have shown that partially digested
      foodstuffs are active against micro-organisms. Earlier work on
      enzyme-modified milk showed that it was able to reduce the binding
      of S. mutans to tooth enamel, which prompted the group to
      investigate the effect of other enzyme-modified foods on bacteria.<br>
      <br>
      Further work will examine how coconut oil interacts with
      Streptococcus bacteria at the molecular level and which other
      strains of harmful bacteria and yeasts it is active against.
      Additional testing by the group at the Athlone Institute of
      Technology found that enzyme-modified coconut oil was also harmful
      to the yeast Candida albicans that can cause thrush.<br>
      <br>
      The researchers suggest that enzyme-modified coconut oil has
      potential as a marketable antimicrobial which could be of
      particular interest to the oral healthcare industry. Dr Damien
      Brady who is leading the research said, "Dental caries is a
      commonly overlooked health problem affecting 60-90% of children
      and the majority of adults in industrialized countries.
      Incorporating enzyme-modified coconut oil into dental hygiene
      products would be an attractive alternative to chemical additives,
      particularly as it works at relatively low concentrations. Also,
      with increasing antibiotic resistance, it is important that we
      turn our attention to new ways to combat microbial infection."<br>
      <br>
      The work also contributes to our understanding of antibacterial
      activity in the human gut. "Our data suggests that products of
      human digestion show antimicrobial activity. This could have
      implications for how bacteria colonize the cells lining the
      digestive tract and for overall gut health," explained Dr Brady.
      "Our research has shown that digested milk protein not only
      reduced the adherence of harmful bacteria to human intestinal
      cells but also prevented some of them from gaining entrance into
      the cell. We are currently researching coconut oil and other
      enzyme-modified foodstuffs to identify how they interfere with the
      way bacteria cause illness and disease," he said. <br>

      </b><br>
      The invention belongs to the technical field of foods, and
      specifically relates to artificial cream base oil rapidly prepared
      by adopting microwave-enzyme-method ester exchange and a
      preparation method thereof. The preparation method of the
      artificial cream base oil rapidly prepared by adopting
      microwave-enzyme-method ester exchange comprises the following
      steps of uniformly mixing liquid oil withsolid oil according to a
      mass ratio of 1 to 1 to 1 to 9; adding natural coconut oil into
      the mixture of the liquid oil and the solid oil, wherein the
      addition amount of the natural coconut oil is 10-30% of the total
      mass of the mixture; carrying out thorough stirring, and adding
      solidified lipase Lipozyme TM IM, wherein the addition amount of
      the solidified lipase Lipozyme TM IM is 2-6% of the total mass of
      the substrate; carrying out reaction in the presence of microwave
      by adopting a pulse mode, wherein the microwave power is 400-600
      watts, the microwave irradiation temperature is 50-70 DEGC, the
      stirring rate is 100-300rpm/min and the reaction time is 5-25
      minutes; and then, removing the solidified lipase Lipozyme TM IM
      after the reaction by performing centrifuging so as to obtain
      theartificial cream base oil. The preparation method of the
      artificial cream base oil rapidly prepared by adopting
      microwave-enzyme-method ester exchange is highly effective,
      energy-saving, and simple in operations; moreover, reaction time
      of enzyme-method ester exchange can be greatly shortened. And
      thus, the prepared artificial cream base oil is free of
      trans-fatty acid, and high in nutritional values. The preparation
      method of the artificial cream base oil rapidly prepared by
      adopting microwave-enzyme-method ester exchange can be used for
      replacing conventional enzyme-method ester exchange soas to
      produce artificial cream base oil.<br>

      </b><br>
      The method for production of an upgraded coconut product comprises
      the steps of: enzymatically treating an aqueous suspension of
      particles of coconut meat, which may be purified, with a cell wall
      degrading enzyme and a galactomannase, all essentially free from
      lipases, and separating a sludge phase. By means of this method a
      higher yield of directly recoverable clear coconut oil can be
      obtained in comparison to the yield of directly recoverably clear
      coconut oil produced by known methods for aqueous coconut oil
      extraction.<br>

      <b>MECHANISM AND REACTION OF UNKNOWN EXCELLENT ENZYME BACTERIA BY
        COCONUT OIL</b><b><br>
      </b><b>JPH01117783 </b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      PURPOSE:To obtain an oil and fat enzyme having health-promoting
      action, by inserting an alkaline spongy body in coconut oil and
      applying a magnetic flux of a prescribed intensity to the spongy
      body, thereby producing an enzyme by the mutual reaction of an oil
      and fat protein, the spongy body and a fatty acid.
      CONSTITUTION:Coconut oil is optionally mixed with edible oil such
      as soybean oil or rapeseed oil and an alkaline spongy body is
      inserted into the oil. The magnetic flux of 1,300 gauss is applied
      to the system for about 30min to cause the mutual reaction of an
      oil and fat protein, the spongy body, a fatty acid, etc., and to
      form an enzyme by the fusion of the oil and fat cell and the
      spongy body cell to a basic body. The obtained enzyme is effective
      as a remedy for diseases of digestive organs, etc.<br>

      PURPOSE:To efficiently decompose coconut oil, etc., by using a
      lipase produced by a mutant of Candida.cylindracea and having a
      high decomposing action on fats and oils containing short chain-
      and moderate-length chain fatty acids. CONSTITUTION:Fats and oils
      are decomposed by using a lipase produced by Candida.cylindracea
      and having a higher specificity to &lt;18C fatty esters than to
      &gt;=18C fatty esters. In addition a strain (FERM no. 10282)

      <b>PREPARATION OF SOLID FAT DECOMPOSITION ENZYME</b><b><br>
      </b><b>JPS6135783 &nbsp;</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      PURPOSE:To obtain a solid fat decomposition enzyme in high yield
      and reproducibility, effectively preventing the foaming during the
      cultivation, by adding a liquid oil and an ether-type surfactant
      to the system in the preparation of the solid fat decomposition
      enzyme by the culture of a microorganism capable of producing a
      solid fat decomposition enzyme. CONSTITUTION:A conventional medium
      used in the cultivation of a microbial strain capable of producing
      a solid fat decomposition enzyme is added with about 0.005-10wt%
      liquid oil (e.g. soybean oil) and about 0.001-10wt% ether- type
      surfactant (e.g. polyoxyethylene alkyl ether). A microbial strain
      capable of producing a solid fat decomposition enzyme (e.g.
      Pseudomonas fluorescens biotype I-No.1021) is inoculated in the
      medium, and cultured under aeration and agitation. The produced
      solid fat decomposition enzyme is separated from the culture
      liquid, and purified. The solid fat decomposition enzyme produced
      by the process is effective to decompose a solid fat such as
      coconut oil into the constituent fatty acid and glycerol, and is
      useful in the fatty acid production industry.<br>
