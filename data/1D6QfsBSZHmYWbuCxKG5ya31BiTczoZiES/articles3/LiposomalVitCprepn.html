      ...New Zealand dairy farmer Alan Smith had a miraculous recovery
      from a coma induced by leukemia and severe double lung
      pneumonia.&nbsp; Doctors were ready to pull the plug on him when
      the family begged them to try high dose IV vitamin C.&nbsp; Alan
      began showing positive results after the doctors administered
      50-100 grams of IV vitamin C.<br>
      <br>
      Unfortunately, the doctors at the hospital who were relatively
      uneducated on vitamin C were concerned about any possible
      complications with the high dose IV vitamin C.&nbsp; They dropped
      the dosage to 2g of vitamin C and Alan began to struggle for
      survival again.&nbsp; His family began giving him 6 grams of oral
      liposomal vitamin C and within weeks he was significantly better
      and was discharged from the hospital...<br>

      <b></b><b>What is Liposomal Vitamin C?</b><b><br>
      </b>Liposomal Vitamin C is a dietary supplement in the most
      bioavailable form of vitamin C that ensures overall support and
      functionality of the body. It provides the body with antioxidants
      that help get rid of toxins and also prevent damage from free
      radicals amongst other benefits.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Possible Side Effects</b><b><br>
      </b>There are no reports made in association with usage of
      Liposomal Vitamin C. This might be attributed to the fact that the
      Vitamin C provided in the supplement is in its purest form...<br>

      <div align="center"><b>Liposomal Vitamin C - Mixing Formula</b><br>
      </div>
      This formula was produced after many tests using diverse milligram
      measurements of lecithin and ascorbic acid to one litre of
      distilled water and completing the ultrasonic cycle. At the end of
      each process the results were observed, until finally the
      successful blend was achieved. By following this formula you will
      have 100 percent success every time.<br>
      <br>
      The formula for making 1 litre liposomal vitamin C. What you will
      need:<br>
      <br>
      88 grams sunflower lecithin powder. (See notes at end.)<br>
      27 grams ascorbic acid (vitamin C).<br>
      One litre of steam-distilled water.<br>
      One 2 litre flat-bottomed borosilicate glass flask.<br>
      One 1 litre flat-bottomed borosilicate glass flask.<br>
      Two 200 millilitre flat-bottomed borosilicate glass flasks.<br>
      A glass rod or glass spoon. Do not use metal.<br>
      A small Pyrex glass saucepan.<br>
      A milligram scale<br>
      An electric hand whisk or a food blender with a glass mixing bowl.<br>
      An ultrasonic cleaner of 2 litre capacity. (See notes at end.)<br>
      A 1 litre glass bottle. (Do not use plastic.)<br>
      <br>
      The process:<br>
      Pour 900 millilitres steam-distilled water into the 2 litre
      borosilicate glass flask.<br>
      Weigh 88 grams of sunflower lecithin, add it to the above and stir
      with glass spoon or glass rod.<br>
      Pour 100 millilitres steam-distilled water into a glass saucepan
      and bring to near boiling.<br>
      Weigh 27 grams ascorbic acid (vitamin C) and place it into a 200
      millilitre borosilicate glass flask. When the water in 3 above is
      near boiling pour it over the ascorbic acid and swirl it until
      dissolved. (This happens very quickly when using very hot water.)<br>
      Then, partly fill the saucepan with cold water and place the 200ml
      borosilicate glass flask with dissolved ascorbic acid into it to
      cool. When it is sufficiently cool or cold pour the ascorbic acid
      fluid into the 2 litre borosilicate glass flask and stir with the
      glass rod or glass spoon. Put a saucer or plate on top and allow
      it to stand for several hours or overnight.<br>
      Use the electric hand food whisk for five minutes to blend the
      lecithin and ascorbic acid mix. (Use a food blender if you do not
      have an electric food whisk.)<br>
      Pour the now thoroughly blended lecithin and ascorbic acid, (but
      not yet liposomal), into the 1 litre flat bottomed borosilicate
      glass flask and place it into the ultrasonic unit.<br>
      Fill the steel well of the ultrasonic unit with water to its
      maximum level and switch on, and let it run it for a total of 100
      minutes. Your ultrasonic unit probably has short timing durations,
      in which case, switch it on again and let it run until you
      complete the full 100 minutes. Periodically stir the solution with
      the glass spoon or glass rod.<br>
      Now you have the best mix of liposomal vitamin C, which you can
      pour into a 1 litre glass bottle and place it into the fridge to
      use when needed.<br>
      <br>
      A note on ultrasonic frequencies<br>
      When the lecithin-ascorbic acid mix is poured directly into the
      steel well of the ultrasonic unit the ultrasonic vibrations will
      cause nanoparticles of metal to migrate into the liposomal vitamin
      C solution. Therefore it is better to use borosilicate glass as
      the receptacle to hold the lecithin-ascorbic acid solution. The
      ultrasonic waves pass from the metal bottom of the ultrasonic unit
      directly through the borosilicate glass flask and into the fluid.
      (For good reason, scientific laboratories use borosilicate glass,
      rather than metal for their research work.)<br>
      <br>
      The ultrasonic cleaner machine needs to be of sufficient size – 2
      litres to hold the 1 litre flat bottomed borosilicate flask. Small
      jewellery ultrasonic cleaners are not suitable for this purpose.<br>
      Sometimes you will notice a very thin film of sediment at the
      bottom of your bottle of liposomal vitamin C – just swill it
      around and pour it into your glass and drink. The occasional tiny
      amount of sediment is because not all particles of sunflower
      lecithin are equal; some are slightly larger and will eventually
      sink to the bottom after the ultrasonic cycle. Bear in mind also
      that all activities are influenced by Lunar Cycles that influence
      result.<br>
      Do not use soy lecithin! Period! All forms of soy products that
      have not gone through a fermentation process are harmful to
      health, including soymilk and Tofu. Use only organic sunflower
      lecithin powder. (I purchase organic sunflower lecithin from
      Germany.)<br>
      Use a glass spoon, not metal or plastic, for measuring; mixing can
      be performed with a glass rod.<br>
      Borosilicate glass flasks can be purchased from a laboratory
      supplier; purchase thick walled borosilicate glass.<br>
      <br>
      Update 2014-2015: Another fellow researcher by the name of Chris
      provided us with a new and novel way to make the highest quality
      liposomal vitamin C...<br>
      <br>
      Vitamin C is the most used supplement in the world. There is good
      reason for this as the science behind the many benefits of vitamin
      C is solid. Dr. Svent Gyorgi and Dr. Linus Pauling performed
      innumerable experiments proving that man, unlike most animals, is
      dependent upon vitamin C for a healthy existence. For decades we
      have relied upon various ascorbic formulas for our supplemental
      needs, but now a whole new vista opens up with Liposomal
      technology.<br>
      <br>
      Increase Absorption Dramatically - Regular vitamin C is absorbed
      at approximately 19%, the balance remains in the gastrointestinal
      tract to attract water and loosen the bowels. Nanotechnology,
      liposomalized vitamin C is absorbed at 93%, measurable in the
      blood stream. A 390% increase in absorption! Get IV results with
      oral dosage!<br>
      <br>
      Heat one cup of distilled water in a ceramic coated or stainless
      steel pan on your stove (do not heat it in a microwave oven) until
      almost boiling.<br>
      Pour the water into your blender and add three level tablespoons
      of lecithin and blend until all of the lecithin is totally
      dissolved in the water.<br>
      In one cup of cold distilled water, dissolve one level tablespoon
      of ascorbic acid. Make sure it is totally dissolved, very
      important!<br>
      Add the ascorbic acid mixture to the lecithin mixture and blend
      well.<br>
      Pour the mixture into the ultrasonic cleaner and turn it on. Stir
      frequently.<br>
      The cleaner will turn itself off about every two minutes or so.
      You continue to stir frequently and turn the cleaner back on until
      ALL of the foam is gone. Repeat: Continue to stir and turn the
      cleaner back on until ALL OF THE FOAM IS GONE!! This will take
      about 30 minutes or so. When done you will have a mix that is
      about the color of milk. There will be some settling but shouldn't
      be much, less than 5% of the mix or so.<br>
      <br>
      When done, pour mix into a reseal able GLASS jar and store in your
      refrigerator.<br>
      Take one teaspoon full of mix once a day.<br>
      You can experiment with this amount after you have taken it for
      awhile to see how it effects you.<br>
      Take on an empty stomach and wait at least 15 minutes before
      eating anything.<br>
      Many take it in the morning before breakfast.<br>
      It is really sour tasting so many chase it with water to get the
      taste out of the mouth.<br>
      <br>
      Another Excellent Recipe is Shown Here:<br>
      This recipe will give you a product between 7.0 and 7.5 (measured
      with Alkalive pH Stix) or similar pH to human blood so there is no
      risk of over acidifying your blood should you take significant
      amounts of your homemade Liposomal Vitamin C Ascorbate.<br>
      (Blood pH is tightly controlled by the body at near 7.35
      pH.&nbsp;&nbsp; If your blood pH were much above or below that
      number you would be a very sick person.)<br>
      Creating an identical pH in your liposomal brew is simply a matter
      of carefully adjusting the level of bicarbonate of soda.<br>
      <br>
      This Vitamin C Ascorbate recipe is a compilation of several
      postings on forums and Pdazzler’s own trials in the kitchen.<br>
      Using a small (2 cup) Ultrasonic cleaner, (Item #03305, obtainable
      from Harbor Freight @ about $30.00), we performed the following:<br>
      1. In qt mixing jar pour 1 cup of distilled water. Add 3 level
      Tablespoons of granular soy lecithin (NOW has non-genetically
      modified soy lecithin) and agitate vigorously for 3 – 5 minutes.<br>
      Then place the lecithin mixture in the refrigerator for two or
      more hours.&nbsp;&nbsp; (You can leave in refrigerator overnight
      if you prefer.)&nbsp;&nbsp; This allows lecithin granules to soak
      up water for easy mixing into solution.<br>
      Note:&nbsp; Mixing can be accomplished easier if you raise the
      temperature of the distilled water being used to 45 degrees
      Celsius (113 degrees Fahrenheit). I have found this unnecessary in
      getting high quality mixtures but others have found this warmer
      temperature helpful.<br>
      After 2 hour soaking period vigorously agitate the mixture for
      another 3 – 5 minutes.&nbsp;&nbsp; At the conclusion there should
      be no lecithin granules visible.&nbsp;&nbsp; Set this smooth
      lecithin mixture aside.<br>
      2. Dissolved 1 level Tablespoon of Pharmaceutical grade Vitamin C
      powder in 2 oz. of distilled water.&nbsp;&nbsp; We recommend you
      use a 6 oz. or larger screw lid jar so you can shake vigorously.<br>
      3. Dissolve 1 Heaping Tablespoon of bicarbonate of soda (Arm &amp;
      Hammer is just fine and aluminum free despite the inferences by
      other companies that their's are aluminum free) in 2 oz. of
      distilled water using a separate 6 oz. or larger screw lid
      jar.&nbsp;&nbsp; Shake or agitate the mixture 3 minutes or until
      soda dissolved.<br>
      *One mole of sodium bicarbonate is 84 grams, and one mole of
      ascorbic acid is 176 grams. So, the correct (stoichiometric) ratio
      of sodium bicarbonate to ascorbic acid is 84/176 = 0.477. For
      example, it would take 477 milligrams of sodium bicarbonate to
      neutralize 1000 milligrams of ascorbic acid.<br>
      **What follows is often the most difficult part of the process for
      those new to making homemade liposomal Vitamin C Ascorbate.<br>
      While stirring the Vitamin C / distilled water solution very
      slowly pour/dribble the dissolved bicarbonate of soda/water
      mixture into the Vitamin C / distilled water solution.&nbsp; (Pour
      soda solution very slowly as the resulting mixture will
      bubble.&nbsp; By pouring slowing and constantly stirring you will
      be able to mix the two without bubbling over.)<br>
      At the conclusion of mixing the bicarbonate of soda mixture into
      the Vitamin C mixture all bubbling will cease.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you
      have any soda settled in the jar pour the resulting total mix
      together into that jar, swirl and pour the resulting Vitamin C /
      Bicarbonate of Soda mixture into the Ultrasonic Cleaner.<br>
      4. Pour the Lecithin solution into ultrasonic cleaner bowl with
      the Vitamin C / Bicarbonate of Soda mixture and stir the contents
      together.<br>
      5. Turn the ultrasonic cleaner on and using a plastic straw
      (leaving the top of the cleaner opened), gently, slowly, stirred
      the contents.<br>
      Note: The cleaner will, automatically, self-stop about every 2
      minutes. Just push ON button to continue. Repeat for a total of 6
      series (12 – 18 minutes). By that time the entire solution should
      be blended into a cloudy, homogeneous, milk-like mixture. The LET
      solution is now well&nbsp; formed.<br>
      You can raise the level of encapsulation by continuing several
      more ultrasonic cycles if desired.<br>
      This protocol furnishes 12 grams (12000mg.) of Vitamin C
      Ascorbate. At an estimated/theoretical 70% – 90% encapsulation
      efficiency, 8400 mg would be of the LET type. This solution will
      keep, acceptably, at room temperature for 3 to 4 days.
      Refrigerated, it will keep much longer.<br>
      Note: A larger, more powerful, ultrasonic cleaner is available at
      Harbor Freight. Item number 91593. 2+ liters, for about $80.00.
      Both units perform well. The larger unit will allow you to make
      higher quality liposomal or more encapsulated supplement at one
      time, depending on the amount you mix.<br>
      This article was written and submitted by an anonymous Australian
      researcher and this method has yielded excellent results everytime
      we have use it. For informational and educational purposes only.
      Void where prohibited.<br>
      <br>
      <i>Process Overview</i><i><br>
      </i>This section outlines the process to create liposomal vitamin
      C. For details on the equipment needed please refer to the
      Equipment section. The sizing of this recipe is for a standard
      sized blender and a one litre beaker.<br>
      For background on why I’ve selected this particular process read
      the Research section. This recipe should yield lipsomal vitamin C
      the same or better than can be purchased online from the large
      manufacturers.<br>
      At each step I specify the modification to the process if you
      don’t have an ultrasound machine.<br>
      <br>
      <i>Ingredients</i><i><br>
      </i>There are two versions of the ingredients. The first is for
      those that have access to 98% pure ethyl alcohol. The second is
      for those that only have access to vodka, or a similarly strong
      spirit. It is recommended that the vodka, or other clear spirit
      has as little added color and taste as possible.<br>
      The amount of vitamin C is just under the saturation level for the
      specified water and alcohol in this recipe. Since It is almost the
      maximum amount of vitamin C that can be dissolved it will give the
      highest potency liposomal vitamin C possible.<br>
      The vitamin C I use is ascorbic acid. I haven’t tried it with
      sodium ascorbate, although so long as it dissolves into the water
      and alcohol it should be easily encapsulated.<br>
      The 12% alcohol by weight was chosen because it falls within range
      specified by the patent (see Research) and is the same used by
      Livon Labs. The alcohol is included because it is very helpful in
      forming liposomes.<br>
      The lecithin granules are 22% phosphatidylcholine. For my
      liposomal vitamin C I use the Solec F’ brand from ‘The Solae
      Company’. Be sure to use lecithin granules instead of liquid
      lecithin.<br>
      Ethyl Alcohol Ingredients<br>
      These ingredients should be used if you have access to 98% pure
      ethyl alcohol. This ethyl alcohol recipe is the one I use for my
      personal liposomal vitamin C. The following table shows the
      ingredients and their order of use.<br>
      Ingredient &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Percent &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Grams<br>

      &nbsp;197.1<br>
      All the ingredients are measured by weight. If you need to convert
      the grams into ounces for your scale multiply the grams by
      0.035274.<br>
      70% Alcohol Ingredients<br>
      These ingredients should be used if you have access to 70% ethyl
      alcohol. The following table shows the ingredients and their order
      of use.<br>
      Ingredient &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Percent &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Grams<br>
      water &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;43.7% &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;415.3<br>
      70% ethyl alcohol &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;18.6% &nbsp;&nbsp;
      &nbsp;177.1<br>
      vitamin C &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;16.9% &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;160.5<br>
      lecithin granules &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;20.7% &nbsp;&nbsp;
      &nbsp;197.1<br>
      All the ingredients are measured by weight. If you need to convert
      the grams into ounces for your scale multiply the grams by
      0.035274.<br>
      Vodka Ingredients<br>
      These ingredients should be used if you have access to vodka or
      other clear 40% spirit instead of ethyl alcohol. The following
      table shows the ingredients and their order of use.<br>
      Ingredient &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Percent &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Grams<br>
      water &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;26.8% &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;254.6<br>
      40% vodka or spirit &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;35.6% &nbsp;&nbsp;
      &nbsp;337.8<br>
      vitamin C &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;16.9% &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;160.5<br>
      lecithin granules &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;20.7% &nbsp;&nbsp;
      &nbsp;197.1<br>
      All the ingredients are measured by weight. If you need to convert
      the grams into ounces for your scale multiply the grams by
      0.035274.<br>
      Changing the Recipe Size<br>
      Both these recipes have been chosen to fit into a standard sized
      blender and a 1L beaker. The total weight of the ingredients is
      950g and it makes about 800ml liposomal vitamin C after the
      bubbles have been removed. Before the bubbles have been removed
      the volume will be closer to 900ml.<br>
      You may adjust the recipe to these common sizes by dividing the
      quantities by the specified amount.<br>
      Required Size &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Divide By<br>
      1/2 cup &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;6.40<br>
      1 cup &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;3.20<br>
      1 1/2 cups &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;2.13<br>
      2 cups &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;1.60<br>
      2 1/2 cups &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;1.28<br>
      3 cups &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;1.07<br>
      <br>
      For example, if you want to make 2 cups of liposomal vitamin C
      after the bubbles have been removed you’d divide all the
      quantities in your selected recipe by 1.6.<br>
      All measurements need to done by weight, especially the vitamin C
      and lecithin granules. Using tablespoons or teaspoons will not
      provide the accuracy required because these ingredients may have
      different densities when purchased from different sources.<br>
      If you don’t have a scale you should purchase a cheap kitchen
      scale (see the Equipment page).<br>
      Step 1: Dissolve Vitamin C in Water and Alcohol<br>
      Measure and add the water, alcohol and vitamin C to the beaker.
      Place the beaker in the ultrasonic bath and heat to 35°C while
      irradiating. Be sure the ultrasonic machine is not set to sweep
      and that you stir the mixture regularly. As a general caution, be
      sure your beaker isn’t touching the sides or bottom of the
      ultrasonic bath and that the water in the ultrasonic bath is to
      the level recommended by the manufacturer.<br>
      The vitamin C about to be dissolved in the water and alcohol<br>
      Settings for the ultrasound machine<br>
      I use a cardboard form to keep the beaker from touching the bottom
      of the ultrasonic tank. I have a stainless steel basket as well,
      however, the ultrasonic power is noticeably less when I use the
      basket instead of suspending the beaker in the water with the
      cardboard.<br>
      When this process completes the temperature will be close to 40°C
      and the liquid will be clear with perhaps a very slight yellowish
      tinge. In the Elmasonic p60h it takes about 15 minutes to dissolve
      the vitamin C with intermittent stirring.<br>
      If you don’t have an ultrasonic machine simply place the water,
      alcohol and vitamin C on the stove and heat while stirring. Be
      sure to turn off the heat when the vitamin C starts to dissolve.
      Keep on stirring until the vitamin C has been completely
      dissolved. You may add a little more heat at intervals if its
      needed to continue the dissolving process.<br>
      <br>
      <i>Step 2: Add Lecithin and Blend</i><i><br>
      </i>There have been reports from people using this recipe that the
      resulting mixture was much too thick after adding the lecithin. If
      you are trying this recipe for the first time hold back 20% of the
      lecithin until after you’ve blended it for the first time. If it
      looks too watery, then slowly add a little more and blend again.
      Repeat this process until the resulting mixture is still liquid
      and can pour easily. I suspect this issue may be caused by
      different lecithin granule manufacturing processes.<br>
      Add the lecithin to the beaker and then promptly pour into the
      blender. If you’re separately measuring the ingredients then you
      can add the lecithin granules directly to the blender. I do a
      cumulative weight and thus I need to add it to the beaker first.<br>
      Lecithin granules added to the water, alcohol and dissolved
      vitamin C<br>
      Mixture promptly poured into the blender<br>
      Blend for about four minutes. It is important that mixture is
      nicely warm to touch as this ensures that the lecithin granules
      have melted and avoids any chance of separation. If you have not
      heated the lecithin granules enough at this stage you’ll see
      separation in your mix after a day or two.<br>
      When finished, place the mixture in the refrigerator.<br>
      Repeat this blending and refrigerating process five or six times
      over twelve hours to be sure the lecithin granules have been
      thoroughly dissolved into the water, alcohol and vitamin C
      solution. For my personal use I often do the blend and refrigerate
      cycle for 24 hours.<br>
      The liposomal C it will heat up when you are blending it. With the
      exception of the first blending cycle, be sure that the
      temperature doesn’t exceed 32°C. For my blender this takes only
      two to three minutes of blending.<br>
      This longer blending process should also remove the ‘snotty’
      strands that often appear in home made liposomal vitamin C. Not
      only are these strands a little unpleasant to drink, but I suspect
      that they don’t encapsulate much vitamin C.<br>
      By the end of this process you’ve already created high quality
      liposomal vitamin C. The following steps show you how to improve
      it further using an ultrasound machine.<br>
      If you don’t have an ultrasound machine you may want to do more
      blending and refrigeration cycles and then skip to step 5!<br>
      <br>
      <i>Step 3: Remove the Bubbles</i><i><br>
      </i>The blending process will add tiny bubbles to your liposomal
      vitamin C. For the ultrasound machine to work at peak efficiency
      you’re going to want to remove these bubbles. This process is also
      known as ‘degassing’.<br>
      Blend the mixture a final time until the blender jar feels warm to
      the touch. The liposomal vitamin C should now be about 35°C. Pour
      the liposomal vitamin C into the beaker and cover with some clear
      plastic wrap.<br>
      Next place the beaker in the ultrasound machine for about 30
      minutes or until the bubbles have been removed. Below are a series
      of photos showing the bubbles being driven out of the mixture over
      time by the ultrasound machine. The color has been modified to
      make it easier to see the bubbles moving upwards. The horizontal
      line indicates the current bottom of the bubbles.<br>
      When the bubbles have been removed the liposomal vitamin C should
      look like this. Notice the much more defined line between the
      bubbles on the top and liquid on the bottom.<br>
      Now place the beaker with the liposomal vitamin C in the
      refrigerator for a few hours to cool it down.<br>
      This step may break down some encapsulation due to excess heat,
      however, it is necessary to remove the bubbles. The encapsulation
      will be increased significantly in the next step.<br>
      If you don’t have an ultrasound machine you should skip this step.<br>
      <br>
      <i>Step 4: Make the Liposomes</i><i><br>
      </i>Actually, you’ve already made lots of liposomes! This step
      will increase your encapsulation percentage even higher.<br>
      Place your liposomal vitamin C in the beaker into your ultrasound
      machine and irradiate it until the temperature reaches 32°C. Once
      it does, place the beaker back into your refrigerator for an hour
      or so to cool it down again.<br>
      Repeat this process until the liposomal vitamin C has had an hour
      of cumulative ultrasonic irradiation.<br>
      If you don’t have an ultrasound machine you should skip this step.<br>
      <br>
      Skim off the bubbles on the top of the liposomal C and pour into a
      glass container and place in your refrigerator.<br>
      This recipe contains about 0.2 grams of vitamin C per millilitre.
      I usually take about 60ml per day in the evening. This works out
      to about 12 grams of vitamin C.<br>

        <b>Liposomal composition of antioxidants for inhalations carried
          out during lung and upper respiratory tract diseases</b><br>
      </div>
      <b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b>The invention relates to medicine and pharmacology, in
      particular to liposomal composition of antioxidants suitable for
      inhalations during lung and upper respiratory tract diseases. The
      inventive antioxidant composition for inhalations of lungs and
      upper respiratory tracts is embodied in the form of an emulsion of
      phospholipides in the form of liposomes, the mean size of the
      particles of which ranges from 0.2 to 0.4 mkm, wherein
      dihydroquercitin flavonoid and wheat-germ oil, containing
      hydrophobic tocopherol antioxidants (vitamin E) and carotinoids,
      are incorporated in the membranes of said particles and the
      aqueous phase of the emulsion contains potassium chloride and
      antioxidants in the form of a cevitamic acid (vitamin C),
      N-acetyl, L-cystein and potassium bensoate. Said antioxidant
      composition is selected taking into account the possibility of
      introducing minimum doses of individual vitamins in such a way
      that the content of an active unoxidised form of antioxidants is
      not reduced during storage.<br>
