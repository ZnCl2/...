      <b>Fucoidan</b> is a sulfated polysaccharide (MW: average 20,000)
      found mainly in various species of brown algae and brown seaweed
      such as mozuku, kombu, bladderwrack, wakame, and hijiki (variant
      forms of fucoidan have also been found in animal species,
      including the sea cucumber). Fucoidan is used as an ingredient in
      some dietary supplement products.<br>
      <br>
      Fucoidan designates a group of certain fucose-containing sulfated
      polysaccharides (FCSPs) that have a backbone built of (1?3)-linked
      a-l-fucopyranosyl or of alternating (1?3)- and (1?4)-linked
      a-l-fucopyranosyl residues, and also include sulfated
      galactofucans with backbones built of (1 ? 6)-ß-d-galacto- and/or
      (1 ? 2)-ß-d-mannopyranosyl units with fucose or
      fuco-oligosaccharide branching, and/or glucuronic acid, xylose, or
      glucose substitutions.[1][2] These FCSPs offer several potentially
      beneficial bioactive functions for humans. The bioactive
      properties may vary depending on the source of seaweed, the
      compositional and structural traits, the content (charge density),
      distribution, and bonding of the sulfate substitutions, and the
      purity of the FCSP product. The preservation of the structural
      integrity of the FCSP molecules essentially depends on the
      extraction methodology which has a crucial, but partly overlooked,
      significance for obtaining the relevant structural features
      required for specific biological activities and for elucidating
      structure-function relations.[1][3]<br>

        <b>Farzaneh Atashrazm, et al.</b><br>

      <b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b>There is a wide variety of cancer types yet, all share some
      common cellular and molecular behaviors. Most of the
      chemotherapeutic agents used in cancer treatment are designed to
      target common deregulated mechanisms within cancer cells. Many
      healthy tissues are also affected by the cytotoxic effects of
      these chemical agents. Fucoidan, a natural component of brown
      seaweed, has anti-cancer activity against various cancer types by
      targeting key apoptotic molecules. It also has beneficial effects
      as it can protect against toxicity associated with
      chemotherapeutic agents and radiation. Thus the synergistic effect
      of fucoidan with current anti-cancer agents is of considerable
      interest. This review discusses the mechanisms by which fucoidan
      retards tumor development, eradicates tumor cells and synergizes
      with anti-cancer chemotherapeutic agents. Challenges to the
      development of fucoidan as an anti-cancer agent will also be
      discussed.<br>

      <b></b><b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b>The objectives of this study were to employ response surface
      methodology (RSM) to investigate and optimize the effect of
      ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE) variables, temperature, time
      and amplitude on the yields of polysaccharides (fucose and total
      glucans) and antioxidant activities (ferric reducing antioxidant
      power (FRAP) and 1,1-diphenyl-2-picryl-hydrazyl radical scavenging
      activity (DPPH)) from Laminaria digitata, and to explore the
      suitability of applying the optimum UAE conditions for L. digitata
      to other brown macroalgae (L. hyperborea and Ascophyllum nodosum).
      The RSM with three-factor, four-level Box-Behnken Design (BBD) was
      used to study and optimize the extraction variables. A second
      order polynomial model fitted well to the experimental data with
      R2 values of 0.79, 0.66, 0.64, 0.73 for fucose, total glucans,
      FRAP and DPPH, respectively. The UAE parameters studied had a
      significant influence on the levels of fucose, FRAP and DPPH. The
      optimised UAE conditions (temperature = 76 °C, time = 10 min and
      amplitude = 100%) achieved yields of fucose (1060.7 ± 70.6 mg/100
      g dried seaweed (ds)), total glucans (968.6 ± 13.3 mg/100 g ds),
      FRAP (8.7 ± 0.5 µM trolox/mg freeze-dried extract (fde)) and DPPH
      (11.0 ± 0.2%) in L. digitata. Polysaccharide rich extracts were
      also attained from L. hyperborea and A. nodosum with variable
      results when utilizing the optimum UAE conditions for L. digitata.<br>

      <b>1. Introduction</b><b><br>
      </b>Macroalgae are a diverse group of organisms capable of
      adapting to the extreme marine environmental conditions by
      producing multiple bioactive compounds. Marine macroalgae are
      considered a rich source of micro- and macronutrients with
      antioxidant activities, i.e., minerals, carotenoids, phenolic
      compounds, proteins and polysaccharides [1].<br>
      <br>
      Macroalgal polysaccharides, particularly fucoidan and laminarin
      have a wide range of biological activities such as antioxidant,
      immunostimulatory and anti-microbial both in vitro and in vivo
      [2,3]. Fucoidans are a family of sulphated fucose-rich
      polysaccharides, built on a backbone of a-l-fucopyranose residues
      [4]. These polysaccharides are an integral part of the cell walls
      of brown macroalgae, playing a crucial role in the protection of
      seaweeds against environmental challenges [5]. Laminarins are
      glucan-polysaccharides containing 1,3-linked ß-d-glucose residues
      with different degrees of 6-O branching and ß-(1,6) intrachain
      links [6]. Hence, glucans are polysaccharides of d-glucose
      monomers that act as energy reserve compounds stored in vacuoles
      inside the macroalgal cells [7].<br>
      <br>
      The traditional extraction methods employed for polysaccharides
      involve the use of one or several solvents used alone or in
      combination with high temperatures [2]. Innovative technologies
      are currently being explored to generate novel extraction
      protocols, aiming to obtain higher yields of bioactive compounds
      and to develop more environmentally friendly processes, with lower
      energy consumption, time and cost of extraction [8].
      Ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE) is one of the most promising
      innovative technologies used to date [9]. The enhancement in the
      extraction of bioactive compounds achieved by UAE is mainly
      attributed to the effect of cavitations in the solvent [10]. The
      process of cavitation involves nucleation, growth and collapse of
      bubbles in a liquid, driven by the bulk pressure variation created
      by the passage of the ultrasound waves. The cavitation creates
      physical effects, such as velocity/pressure shockwaves that causes
      cell disruption, and micro-turbulences that mixes and accelerates
      the extraction of bioactive compounds through the cell membranes
      [8,10]. The UAE has been utilized to extract multiple functional
      molecules from plants [11,12,13], macroalgae [14,15] and
      microalgae [16]...<br>
      <br>
      <b>2.2. Optimization of the Extraction of Polysaccharides and
        Antioxidant Activity</b><b><br>
      </b>The current study focuses on the extraction of both fucose and
      glucans together along with their antioxidant activity by
      optimizing time, temperature and amplitude. All extraction
      parameters were optimized by using a more powerful semi-industrial
      ultra-sonication device (power 500 W, 20 kHz), compared to a lab
      grade ultra-sonication device used in previous studies [7,20].
      Optimum conditions were determined aiming to maximize the yields
      of (i) fucose (condition 1), (ii) total glucans (condition 2),
      (iii) antioxidant activities (FRAP and DPPH) (condition 3) and
      (iv) yield of polysaccharides and antioxidant activities combined
      (condition 4). The levels of the three independent parameters used
      in UAE (temperature, time and ultrasonication amplitude), together
      with the predicted values and the experimental results obtained
      from L. digitata extracts are summarized in Table 4. The predicted
      values of the theoretical model for the four optimum conditions
      described were confirmed with the experimental data with the
      exception of the FRAP values, which were lower than the predicted
      values in both conditions 3 and 4.<br>
      <br>
      The optimum UAE extraction conditions to obtain high yields of
      fucose from L. digitata were temperature (80 °C), time (30 min)
      and ultrasonication amplitude (40%; condition 1; Table 4). There
      is some conflicting data in the literature with regard to the
      influence of these conditions on the yields of fucose. Previous
      studies using UAE did not identify an influence of time or
      amplitude on the fucose content of extracts from A. nodosum [20].
      Our results suggested that temperature is a critical factor for
      getting higher yield of both fucose and glucans along with total
      antioxidant activity, which was neglected in previous studies
      [7,20]. Our results are in agreement with Ale et al. [22] wherein
      the temperature and time of extraction also had an influence on
      the extraction of fucose from Sargassum spp. using conventional
      extraction techniques, with optimum extraction conditions obtained
      at temperatures of 90 °C over a 4 h period. However, previous
      researchers optimizing UAE conditions to obtain bioactive
      compounds from plants identified an influence of temperature, time
      and various ultrasonication parameters (i.e., frequency and power)
      on the yields of polysaccharides [23,24].<br>
      <br>
      The optimum UAE extraction conditions to obtain high yields of
      total glucans from L. digitata were temperature (52.5 °C), time
      (10 min) and ultrasonication amplitude (100%; condition 2; Table
      4). High ultrasonication amplitudes were also required to recover
      glucans from mushroom by-products (Agaricus bisporus) with the
      highest yields of glucans obtained applying high ultrasonic
      amplitudes (100 µm) for 15 min, followed by 1 h of precipitation
      with ethanol [25]. A previous study carried out by Kadam et al.
      [7] using 0.1 M HCl showed an increased extraction of glucans from
      L. hyperborea and A. nodosum at 60% of ultrasonic amplitude for 15
      min, although the optimization of the UAE parameters was not
      performed [7].<br>

      The optimum UAE extraction conditions to obtain high yields of

      and ultrasonication amplitude (40%; condition 1; Table 4). There
      is some conflicting data in the literature with regard to the

      <br>
      The optimum UAE extraction conditions to obtain high yields of
      total glucans from L. digitata were temperature (52.5 °C), time
      (10 min) and ultrasonication amplitude (100%; condition 2; Table
      4). High ultrasonication amplitudes were also required to recover

      L. hyperborea and A. nodosum at 60% of ultrasonic amplitude for 15
      min, although the optimization of the UAE parameters was not
      performed [7].<br>
      <br>
      The mild extraction conditions needed to preserve the antioxidant
      activities (FRAP and DPPH) of extracts from L. digitata
      (temperature 40 °C, time 30 min and amplitude 40%; condition 3;
      Table 4) could be due to the antioxidant power of other
      thermolabile compounds that could be present in the crude
      extracts, such as proteins/peptides [1] and polyphenols [26,27].
      In fact, previous studies optimizing UAE to achieve phenolic
      compounds from brown macroalgae (Hormosira banksia) obtained
      maximum phenolic contents using low temperatures (30 °C) at medium
      sonication power (60%) for 60 min [28].<br>
      <br>
      The optimum conditions to obtain both high yields of
      polysaccharides and antioxidant activities were of temperature (76
      °C), time (10 min) and ultrasonication amplitude (100%; condition
      4; Table 4). To our knowledge there are no studies presented in
      the literature that aim to optimize the yields of polysaccharides
      and its antioxidant activities from any species of seaweed.<br>
      2.3. Application of Optimal UAE Conditions in other Brown
      Macroalgae<br>
      <br>
      The applicability of the four optimum conditions for L. digitata
      was subsequently explored to generate polysaccharide rich extracts
      from other brown macroalgae with commercial value (L. hyperborea
      and A. nodosum). The contents of fucose, total glucans and
      antioxidant activities (FRAP and DPPH) of extracts from L.
      hyperborea and A. nodosum using optimal UAE conditions are
      compiled in Table 5. L. hyperborea extracts had higher contents of
      total glucans and DPPH activities, being approximately 10 and 4
      fold higher than the values obtained from L. digitata,
      respectively. A. nodosum extracts showed powerful antioxidant
      activities (FRAP and DPPH) when compared to both Laminaria
      species. Previous studies aiming the UAE of fucose and glucans
      from brown macroalgae achieved extracts containing 87.06 mg
      fucose/g from A. nodosum [20] and 5.29–6.24 mg glucans/100 mg from
      L. hyperborea and A. nodosum, although the antioxidant activity of
      these extracts was not reported [7]...<br>
      <br>
      <b>4. Conclusions</b><b><br>
      </b>Ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE) was studied for the
      extraction of polysaccharides (fucose and glucans) and antioxidant
      activities (FRAP and DPPH) from L. digitata. Response surface
      methodology was employed to investigate the effect of the UAE
      variables (temperature, time and ultrasonic amplitude) on the
      macroalgal extracts to enhance the yields of polysaccharides and
      its antioxidant activities. The UAE parameters studied showed
      significant influence on the levels of fucose, FRAP and DPPH.
      Levels of 1060.75 mg/100 g ds, 968.57 mg/100 g ds, 8.70 µM
      trolox/mg fde and 11.02% were obtained for fucose, total glucans,
      FRAP and DPPH respectively at optimized conditions of temperature
      (76 °C), time (10 min) and ultrasonic amplitude (100%) using 0.1 M
      HCl as solvent. The UAE conditions described were then applied
      successfully to other economically relevant brown macroalgae (L.
      hyperborea and A. nodosum) to obtain polysaccharide rich extracts.
      This study demonstrates the applicability of UAE to enhance the
      extraction of bioactive polysaccharides from various macroalgal
      species.<br>

      </b>PURPOSE: A method for preparing physiologically active
      fucoidan using a tangleweed root extract is provided to prevent
      the loss of active ingredients in tangleweed roots through low
      temperature extraction and to improve extraction yield and the
      purity of a fucoidan marker. CONSTITUTION: A method for preparing
      physiologically active fucoidan using a tangleweed root extract
      comprises the steps of: removing foreign materials from dried
      tangleweed roots (S100); crushing the dried tangleweed roots
      (S200); putting the dried tangleweed roots into a roasting machine
      and spraying with alcohol; rotating at low speed; closing the
      roasting machine when the fragrance of the tangleweed roots is
      vaporized; adding flavor to the tangleweed roots and plasticizing
      (S300); washing the plasticized tangleweed roots (S400); adding
      distilled water to the tangleweed roots, adding lyase, and
      extracting the tangleweed roots at 35-50 °C (S500); adding
      distilled water to the tangleweed roots and extracting in a vacuum
      condition at 35-50 °C (S600); putting the extract into a fermentor
      and culturing one or more kinds of strains in the extract for
      10-30 hours (S700); and isolating and purifying the fermented
      culture liquid and distilling (S800). [Reference numerals] (AA)
