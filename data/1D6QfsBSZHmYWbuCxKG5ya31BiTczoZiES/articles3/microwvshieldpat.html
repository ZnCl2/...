      The invention relates to electronic equipment, in particular the
      production of polymer compositions intended to absorb the energy
      of parasitic types of waves in the chart-forming devices of the
      quasi-optical type of multibeam antenna arrays made on foil
      microwave fluoroplast-based dielectrics.<br>
      Known "Composition for the absorption of high-frequency energy"
      [RU 2349615 C1, publ. 20.09.2009 , IPC C09D 5/32]. The essence of
      this invention is that it contains a polymer - synthetic rubber,
      heat-resistant low molecular weight SKTN, cold-curing catalyst
      K-68, as well as an absorbent filler - iron carbonyl radio grade
      R-10 in the following ratio of components, May. including:<br>

      &lt;tb &gt; brand P-10 78-83<br>
      The composition for absorbing high-frequency energy of such a
      composition is made by simply mixing the components and curing
      them at room temperature.<br>
      However, this composition has a significant shrinkage after curing
      and various climatic influences, insufficient absorbing
      properties. Known "Polymer composition for the absorption of
      high-frequency energy" [RU 2493186 C1, publ. 20.09.2013 year IPC
      C09D 5/32] contains low molecular weight dimethylsiloxane SKTN as
      a base, iron carbonyl radio engineering and cold curing catalyst
      K-68 as an absorbing filler, in addition, it additionally contains
      a solution of high-molecular-mass SKT in a polymethylsiloxane
      liquid and tetraethoxysilane isomericyne isomers, and it also
      contains a solution of high-molecular-mass SKT in a
      polymethylsiloxane liquid and tetraethoxysilane and its
      composition. , as well as polyethylene polyamine as a curing rate
      regulator in the following ratio of components, wt. including:<br>
      Low molecular weight dimethylsiloxane rubber SKTN 13-20 Rubber 2-3

      Polyethylene polyamine to 1.0 Polymethylsiloxane liquid selected
      by from PMS-50 and PMS-100 2-3<br>
      The method of obtaining the composition consists in the fact that
      iron carbonyl radio engineering is pre-combined with rubber with
      low molecular weight dimethylsiloxane SKTN, part of
      polymethylsiloxane fluid, part of tetraethoxysilane or its
      derivatives in component A, and is kept after mixing for at least
      24 hours. its derivatives in component B, incubated after mixing
      to a homogeneous state for at least 24 hours, and then mixed with
      component A, add catalyst K-68 or its mixture with polyethylene
      polyamine followed by curing.<br>
      However, this composition is multicomponent, laborious (more than
      24 hours to prepare and 24 hours to cure) and does not provide the
      required attenuation of the electromagnetic wave of the microwave
      range.<br>
      The closest in technical essence to the proposed polymer
      composition is a "Polymer composition for the absorption of
      high-frequency energy" [RU 2497851 C1, publ. 10.11.2013 MCP G08L].
      Polymer composition for absorbing high-frequency energy,
      containing polymer - synthetic rubber of low molecular weight
      dimethylsiloxane SKTN, catalyst - cold curing catalyst ?68, and
      also contains P-10 radio-carbonyl radio engineering grade 40 as
      well as absorbing filler, with the following ratio of components ,

      Ethyl silicate-40 1.5-2.5.<br>
      The disadvantage of the prototype is the high value of the
      relative dielectric constant and, as a result, insufficient
      coordination of the transition from the foiled dielectric to the
      absorbing composition, which makes it impossible to use it for the
      manufacture of plates for absorbing the energy of parasitic wave
      types in devices based on fluoroplastic based foil .<br>
      The technical problem of the claimed invention is to improve the
      properties of the absorbing material.<br>
      The technical result of the proposed invention is to obtain a
      polymer composition that provides a good level of coordination of
      the transition from the foiled microwave dielectric to the
      absorbing composition, which is associated with a decrease in the
      real part of the relative dielectric constant and reflection
      coefficient at a normal incidence of a flat uniform
      electromagnetic wave at the "insulator-absorber" interface .<br>
      The essence of the invention lies in the fact that the proposed
      polymer composition for absorbing high-frequency energy contains
      polymer - synthetic rubber of low molecular weight
      dimethylsiloxane SKTN, and cold curing catalyst K-68, as well as
      absorbing filler - iron carbonyl radio technical grade P-10 and
      ethyl silicate-40.<br>
      New is the fact that they use the polymer composition in the
      following ratio of components, in May. including:<br>
      Synthetic low-molecular rubber dimethylsiloxane SKTN GOST 13835-73

      The polymer composition for absorbing high-frequency energy is
      made by simply mixing the components and curing at room
      temperature.<br>
      Table 1 shows the compositions of the proposed composition for
      absorption<br>
      high frequency energy.<br>
      [image]<br>
      The specified range of components is chosen due to the fact that
      with a decrease in the amount of carbonyl carbon radio
      engineering, the absorbing properties deteriorate, and with an
      increase it is impossible to achieve the required level of
      matching. With a decrease in the amount of cold curing catalyst
      No. 68, the composition does not completely cure, and with an
      increase, the viscosity quickly increases, the viability of the
      composition decreases, and the electrophysical parameters
      deteriorate due to the presence of unselected air bubbles.<br>

      As can be seen from the data presented in table 2, the proposed
      polymer composition for the absorption of high-frequency energy
      has the advantages:<br>
      - a lower maximum value of the dielectric constant of the
      absorbing composition in the frequency range 12-14 GHz ("8.4" vs.
      "20");<br>
      - a lower maximum value of the power reflection coefficient at a
      normal incidence of a flat homogeneous electromagnetic wave at the
      interface "foil microwave fluoroplast-based dielectric - absorbing
      composition" in the frequency range 12-14 GHz ("-12" vs. "-7.5" ).<br>

      Abstract The invention belongs to the technical field of
      electromagnetic functional materials. The powder absorbent is
      used, and the surface of the absorbent is coated to achieve high
      microwave permeability, which imparts high traveling wave
      attenuation in the P-band and increases the filling ratio in the
      matrix material. The P-band traveling wave suppression sheet
      according to the present invention is a vulcanized film containing
      a sheet-like absorbent having a thickness of 3.5 to 10 mm, and the
      material quality composition comprises at least 20 parts of a
      sheet-like absorbent powder of 60 to 110 parts of a base rubber.
      The P-band traveling wave suppression sheet according to the
      present invention has high saturation magnetization, good weather
      resistance, good insulation performance, and high magnetic
      permeability in the microwave section. In the radar wave P-band
      has high magnetic permeability and magnetic loss, the average
      value of the traveling wave loss effect of the material of 3 to 10
      mm thick in the frequency range of 300 MHz to 1000 MHz is greater
      than -10 dB. Applicable to the field of electromagnetic
      anti-interference, especially suitable for phased array radar.<br>
      P-band traveling wave suppression sheet<br>
      Technical field<br>
      The invention belongs to the technical field of electromagnetic
      functional materials, and relates to anti-interference
      electromagnetic material design technology, in particular to
      P-band anti-interference technology.<br>
      Background technique<br>
      P-band as radar detection signal has many advantages: P-band can
      detect stealth target; P-band atmospheric attenuation is small,
      detection distance is far; P-band radar component has low process
      difficulty and low power consumption.<br>
      The distance between the remote warning phased array radar
      antennas is relatively close. When the two antenna arrays work at
      the same time, due to the traveling wave, the antenna array will
      interfere with each other, and there are electromagnetic
      interference and electromagnetic compatibility problems, which
      cannot work normally, which seriously affects the use efficiency
      and system tasks of the radar. To solve this problem, there are
      two schemes for suppressing traveling waves by electromagnetic
      functional materials and expanding the dynamic range of the
      receiver. Extending the dynamic range of the receiver requires
      changes to the antenna design, replacement of some key components,
      long development cycle, and huge research costs. The use of
      electromagnetic functional materials does not require changes to
      the antenna array. It is only necessary to lay the absorbing
      material directly in the middle of the two antenna arrays, which
      has a short development cycle and is easy to operate.<br>
      At present, domestic application bands for absorbing sheets are
      mainly concentrated in the range of 1 to 18 GHz, which are used
      for special parts of aircraft and missiles. There are no reports
      and studies on sheets below 1 GHz, especially for P-bands for
      absorbing.<br>

      particular to a cone absorbing material and a preparation method
      thereof.<br>
      Background technique<br>
      Absorbing material is a type of material that absorbs the energy
      of electromagnetic waves that are projected onto its surface. In
      engineering applications, in addition to requiring the absorbing
      material to have a high absorption rate for electromagnetic waves
      in a wide frequency band, it is also required to have light
      weight, temperature resistance, moisture resistance, corrosion
      resistance and the like.<br>
      At present, patch-type materials generally have the disadvantage
      of high surface density, and the temperature resistance is
      generally lower than 100 ° C, which cannot meet the mechanical
      properties of equipment such as aircraft. A microporous absorbing
      material having an array structure surface developed, and some
      materials are subjected to a microcellular foaming process during
      vulcanization, and the obtained material has a small surface
      density, but the absorbing agent used is micron. Conductive carbon
      black, although conductive carbon black is used as a absorbing
      agent on the one hand and as a reinforcing agent on the other
      hand, the biggest disadvantage of using carbon black as an
      absorbent is that the absorbing property is poor and cannot be
      very good. Meet the absorbing requirements of cutting-edge
      technical equipment such as ship equipment.<br>

      Detailed ways<br>
      The technical solutions in the embodiments of the present
      invention are clearly and completely described in the following
      with reference to the accompanying drawings in the embodiments of
      the present invention. It is obvious that the described
      embodiments are only a part of the embodiments of the present
      invention, but not all embodiments. All other embodiments obtained

      Method for preparing a tapered absorbing material<br>
      Step 1: Polyurethane rubber, stearic acid, anti-aging agent,
      dicumyl peroxide, plasticizer and carbonyl iron powder are mixed
      and mixed in proportion to obtain a dense polyurethane rubber. In
      a preferred embodiment, in this step, 100 parts by weight of
      urethane rubber, 0.3 to 3 parts of stearic acid, 0.5 to 0.5 parts
      by mass in an internal mixer and at a temperature of 65 to 85 °C.

      to 6 parts of a plasticizer, and 50 to 80 parts of carbonyl iron
      powder are mixed and uniformly mixed. Among them, the antioxidant
      includes one or a combination of N-phenyl-a-aniline,
      N-phenyl-ß-naphthylamine, N-phenyl-N'-cyclohexyl
      p-phenylenediamine. The plasticizer includes one or a combination
      of di-n-octyl phthalate, benzene polyacrylates, diisobutyl
      phthalate, and dimethyl phthalate. In this step, the additive is
      not limited to the additives such as antioxidants and plasticizers
      listed in the step, and other additives may be added according to
      actual conditions and needs. In this step, a certain proportion of
      the absorbing agent carbonyl iron powder is added to further
      improve the absorbing properties of the finally obtained tapered
      absorbing material. The carbonyl iron powder has strong absorbing
      ability and large magnetic loss, but its density is large, the
      absorbent has a large duty ratio, and has a large specific surface

      Technical field<br>
      The utility model relates to a microwave heater, in particular to
      a microwave shielding device used in a microwave heater.<br>
      Background technique<br>
      Pavement maintenance mainly requires heating the pavement,
      especially the asphalt pavement, to soften it, and then filling
      the asphalt to repair the pavement. In the prior art, gas infrared

      asphalt heating is used to soften the asphalt of the road surface,
      and then new materials are added for road surface repair.<br>
      Microwave heaters are generally used in microwave heating
      equipment and are connected to the underside of the chassis to
      heat the road surface. The microwave heater is designed as a
      heating wall. The width of the heating wall cannot be greater than
      the width of the road during the walking process. Therefore, when

      leakage increases the heating efficiency of the microwave heater.<br>

      solution adopted by the present invention is to provide a
      microwave shielding device, which comprises two bending members

      another and quickly entered the homes of ordinary people, bringing
      great convenience to life. However, people are worried that they
      are suffering from different electromagnetic waves while enjoying
      these benefits. Degree of violation. Long-term in the
      electromagnetic wave environment, it is easy to cause the human
      body to produce lesions, and electromagnetic waves will interfere
      with the normal operation of various electronic devices and
      communication instruments, and even cause malfunction.
      Electromagnetic interference is the fourth largest source of
      environmental pollution after industrial “three wastes”.
      Therefore, how to effectively prevent and eliminate
      electromagnetic interference has become the focus of the
      scientific and technological community.<br>
      Graphene, a honeycomb two-dimensional material, has been
      successfully ranked among the top in the list of commonly used
      absorbing materials due to its light weight, large specific
      surface area, good flexibility, good electrical conductivity and
      large dielectric loss. At the same time, the surface of the
      oxidized graphene is exposed to a large number of chemical bonds,
      and the polarization relaxation is more likely to occur under the
      action of the electromagnetic field, thereby achieving the purpose
      of attenuating the electromagnetic wave, which also makes the
      application of graphene in the field of absorbing waves more
      broad. However, new absorbing materials need to meet the
      requirements of “thin, light, wide and strong”. Electrical losses
      are mainly derived from electron polarization, atomic
      polarization, intrinsic electric dipole orientation polarization,
      and interfacial polarization. Magnetic losses mainly include eddy
      current loss, hysteresis loss and residual loss. Graphene has
      large dielectric loss and a small amount of magnetic loss. The
      single graphene interface has poor impedance matching, and its
      loss mechanism is less, and the absorbing effect is not strong.
      However, since graphene has a large specific surface area, it can
      be combined with a magnetic loss absorbing material to form a
      complementary advantage. On the one hand, the combination of the
      electric loss absorbing material and the magnetic loss absorbing
      material can exert two forms of electromagnetic loss. To obtain
      better electromagnetic wave absorption performance; on the other
      hand, compounding with light weight graphene material is also
      beneficial to reduce the weight of the absorbing material.<br>

      The phase structure analysis of the graphene-based composite
      absorbing material prepared in Example 1 was carried out by X-ray

      GO, and (e) denotes PANI. From Fig. 1, we can see that at 30.1°,
      32.2°, 34.1°, 37.0°, 40.3 Characteristic diffraction peaks
      appeared at °, 42.3°, 55.20°, 56.83° and 63.31°, which is
      basically consistent with the characteristic peak of standard

      FIELD: chemistry.SUBSTANCE: invention relates to radioelectronic
      engineering, particularly to producing polymer compositions for
      absorbing high-frequency energy in microwave devices, e.g. in
      amplifiers of compensation channels of radar stations. The polymer
      composition for absorbing high-frequency energy contains a polymer
      - low-molecular weight dimethylsiloxane synthetic rubber SKTN, a
      cold curing catalyst No68 and absorbent filler - pigment aluminium
      powder.EFFECT: invention provides improved absorption properties
      with low thickness of the absorbent layer in a wide temperature
      range and high humidity.<br>
      <br>
      The invention relates to electronic equipment, in particular the
      production of polymer compositions intended to absorb
      high-frequency energy in microwave devices, for example, in
      amplifiers of compensation channels of radar stations.<br>
      Known polymer composition for the absorption of high-frequency
      energy [RF patent 2294347 C1, published 27.02.2007], including
      synthetic low molecular weight rubber dimethylsiloxane SKTN,
      absorbing filler powder alsifer fraction not more than 63 microns
      and the catalyst for cold hardening No. 68, with the following
      ratio of components, wt.h. .:<br>
      Synthetic low-molecular rubber dimethylsiloxane SKTN 15-25 Powder
      alsifer fraction not exceeding 63 microns 75-85 Cold-curing
      catalyst ?68 0.6 -one,0<br>
      The disadvantage of this composition is the complex manufacturing
      technology of alsifer powder and low absorbing properties with a
      small thickness of the absorbing layer.<br>
      The closest in technical essence to the proposed polymer
      composition for absorbing high-frequency radiation is [RF Patent
      2349615 C1, published March 20, 2009] a polymer composition for
      absorbing high-frequency energy, containing synthetic rubber of
      low molecular weight dimethylsiloxane SKTN, cold curing catalyst
      No. 68, and absorbing iron filler carbonyl radio engineering, in
      the following ratio of components, parts by weight:<br>
      Synthetic low-molecular rubber dimethylsiloxane SKTN 15-25
      Radio-carbonyl iron of the mark ?-10 78-83 Cold-curing catalyst
      ?68 0.6 -one,0<br>
      The disadvantage of the prototype is the high density and low
      absorption properties with a small thickness of the absorbing
      layer.<br>
      The technical result of the invention is to obtain a polymer
      composition with high absorbing properties with a small thickness
      of the applied absorbing layer in a wide range of temperatures and
      high humidity, which is important for onboard equipment of
      aircraft.<br>
      The essence of the invention is that the proposed polymer
      composition for absorbing high-frequency energy contains polymer -
      synthetic rubber of low molecular weight dimethylsiloxane SKTN (TU
      2294-002-00152000-96) and cold-curing catalyst ?68 (OST
      38.03239-81), as well as absorbing filler.<br>
      New in the proposed solution is that the polymer composition to
      absorb high-frequency energy as an absorbing filler contains
      aluminum pigment powder (GOST 5494-71) in the following ratio of
      components, parts by weight:<br>
      Synthetic low molecular rubber dimethylsiloxane SKTN (TU
      2294-002-00152000-96) 15-25 Cold-cured Catalyst No. 68 (OST
      38.03239-81) 0.5-1.2 Aluminum pigment powder (GOST 5494-71) 12-20<br>
      The polymer composition for absorbing high-frequency energy is
      made by simply mixing the components and curing them at room
      temperature.<br>
      Table 1 shows the compositions of the proposed composition for the
      absorption of high-frequency energy.<br>
      Table 1 PPN Components Example 1 Example 2 Example 3 1 Low
      molecular weight synthetic rubber 15 20 25 dimethylsiloxane SKTN 2
      Cold-cured catalyst ?68 0.5 0.85 1.2 &lt;tb &gt; 3 Aluminum
      pigment powder 12 16 20<br>
      The specified range of components is chosen due to the fact that
      with a decrease in the amount of aluminum powder the required
      efficiency of microwave energy absorption is not achieved, and
      with an increase, the composition is non-technological (viscous,
      non-uniform) and cannot be applied with a thin layer.<br>
      With an increase in the number of catalyst for cold curing ?68
      reduces the viability of the composition, while due to the rapid
      increase in viscosity it is impossible to obtain a thin
      homogeneous film of the composition.<br>
      When reducing the amount of catalyst for cold curing ?68 does not
      completely cure the absorbent composition.<br>
      Table 2 shows the results of comparative tests of the analogue and
      the claimed polymer composition for absorbing high-frequency
      energy deposited on the microwave signal amplifier.<br>

      As can be seen from the data presented in table 2, the proposed
      polymer composition for absorbing high-frequency energy has
      several advantages:<br>
      - the efficiency of the absorption of microwave energy with a
      small thickness of the absorbing layer ("13-18 dB" against "5 dB"
      with a thickness of less than 1 mm);<br>
      - radio-technical characteristics are preserved in a wide range of
      temperatures (from -60 ° C to 200 ° C) and exposure to high
      humidity;<br>
      - lower density ("1.5-1.6 g / cm &lt;3&gt;" against "4.45 g / cm
      &lt;3&gt;"), which is important for the onboard equipment of the
      aircraft.<br>
      - weight reduction of the proposed composition in comparison with
      the prototype more than 5 times <br>
