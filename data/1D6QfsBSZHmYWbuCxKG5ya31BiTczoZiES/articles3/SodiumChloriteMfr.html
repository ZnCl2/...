        <b>Preparation method of sodium chlorite</b><br>
      </div>
      <b>Abstract</b><br>
      The invention discloses a preparation method of sodium chlorite.
      The preparation method comprises the following steps of (1)
      enabling sodium chlorate solution to react with hydrochloric acid
      to generate chlorine dioxide gas and chlorine; (2) leading
      chlorine dioxide gas and chlorine into sodium chlorite solution to
      further react, so as to generate chlorine dioxide gas; (3) leading
      the chlorine dioxide gas into sodium hydroxide solution, and
      adding hydrogen peroxide to react, so as to generate sodium
      chlorite at the same time; (4) crystallizing and drying sodium
      chlorite prepared in the step (3) to obtain a final product,
      wherein the concentration of the sodium chlorate solution in the
      step (1) is 25-33%, the concentration of hydrochloric acid
      solution in the step (1) is 31%, and the molar ratio of the
      hydrochloric acid to chlorous acid in the step (1) is (1-1.5) to
      2. The preparation method of sodium chlorite disclosed by the
      invention does not utilize concentrated sulfuric acid of which the
      concentration is over 95%, is easy in control of the reaction
      process, not drastic in reaction, higher in safety coefficient,
      low in cost, and suitable for industrial large-scale application
      at the same time.<br>

      <b>Abstract</b><br>
      Alkali metal chlorite, particularly sodium chlorite, is produced
      with a low carbonate level by combining a chlorine dioxide
      generating system operating at subatmospheric pressure with a
      chlorite formation reactor in which the chlorine dioxide reacts
      with hydrogen peroxide in the presence of aqueous alkali metal
      hydroxide, particularly sodium hydroxide.<br>

      <b>Abstract</b><br>
      Chlorites are formed by reducing chlorine dioxide with arsenious
      acid in the presence of an alkali metal hydroxide, or alkaline
      earth metal oxide or hydroxide, while avoiding an excess of
      arsenious acid. 70-80 per cent of the arsenate produced, e.g.
      sodium arsenate, precipitates from the chlorite solution, and the
      balance is recovered by evaporation. It is reconverted to
      arsenious acid, for reuse, by treatment in solution with sulphur
      dioxide.<br>

        <b>Manufacture of alkali chlorites</b><br>
      </div>
      <b>Abstract</b><br>
      In the manufacture of an alkali chlorite, a mixture of chlorine
      and chlorine-dioxide, produced by the action of hydrochloric acid
      on an alkali and/or alkaline earth chlorate and entrained by air,
      is caused to undergo particle physical purification of the
      chlorine dioxide by being mixed with a concentrated solution of an
      alkali or alkaline earth chloride and/or chlorate, whereby most of
      the chlorine dioxide and a little chlorine are absorbed, which
      mixture is then desorbed, e.g. by a current of air, and further
      purified by being passed through a solution or milk of lime or
      another alkaline earth base after which the chlorine dioxide is
      absorbed by an alkali hydroxide and/or carbonate, the products,
      e.g. sodium chlorite and sodium chlorate thus obtained being
      separated by crystallisation and, if desired, by evaporation. The
      chlorates, for the production of which the unabsorbed gases from
      the partial physical purification may be used, fused in the
      production of the chlorine dioxide may be previously freed from
      all or a part of alkali or alkaline earth chlorides. The solution
      after desorption may be used for absorbing further quantities of
      the gases, while the gaseous mixture from the desorption tower may
      be brought into contact with a solution or milk of an alkaline
      earth hydroxide to produce a gaseous mixture containing only air
      and chlorine, dioxide and a solution of alkaline earth chloride
      and chlorate which may be returned to the chlorine dioxide
      generator, as may be the alkali chlorate separated from the
      chlorite in the final stage while the mother liquors may be
      returned to the final absorption.<br>
