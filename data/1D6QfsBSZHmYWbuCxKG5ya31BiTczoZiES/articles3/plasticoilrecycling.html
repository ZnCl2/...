              by turning the waste into valuable fuel</b><br>
            <div align="left"><br>
              ...For years, Ramesh explains, pyrolysis technologies have
              been used to break down or depolymerize unwanted polymers,
              such as plastic wastes, leaving a hydrocarbon-based fuel.
              But the process usually calls for complex and costly
              refining steps to make the fuel useable.<br>
              <br>
              Ramesh set out to change the game and developed a
              metallocene catalyst deposited on a porous support
              material that, coupled with a controlled pyrolysis
              reaction, yields diesel fuels directly without further
              refining. It is also cost-effective on a small scale, runs
              at lower temperatures and is mobile.<br>
              <br>
              "The catalyst system also allows us to perform the
              pyrolysis as a continuous-feed process and shrink the
              footprint of the whole system," Ramesh says. "We can scale
              the capacity to handle anywhere from 200 pounds per
              10-hour day to 10,000 or more pounds per 10-hour day.
              Because of its small size, we also can take the
              technological process to where the plastic wastes are."
              The whole system can fit in a 20-foot shipping container
              or on the back of a flat-bed truck, Holm says.<br>
              <br>
              The next step, they say, is to show the technology works
              well and that it can create a useable drop-in diesel fuel.
              They will soon conduct a demonstration project for the
              government of the city of Santa Cruz, California.
              Officials there are interested in implementing the
              technology to address waste plastics that currently cannot
              be recycled, as well as to formulate diesel fuel the city
              can use for its vehicles, Holm adds.<br>
              <br>
              "If we can get people around the world to pick this up and
              use it to shift waste plastics to fuel and make money, we
              are winning," Holm says. "We can even eliminate plastic
              waste before it gets to the oceans by creating value for
              it locally on a global basis."...<br>

          <div align="center"><b>Plastic to Oil Fantastic</b><b><br>
            </b><b>by Carol Smith</b><b><br>
            </b></div>
          <br>
          We are all well aware of plastic’s “rap-sheet.” It has been
          found guilty on many counts, including the way its production
          and disposal raises resource issues and lets loose extremely
          negative environmental impacts.<br>
          <br>
          Typically made from petroleum, it is estimated that 7% of the
          world’s annual oil production is used to produce and
          manufacture plastic. That is more than the oil consumed by the
          entire African continent.<br>
          <br>
          Plastic’s carbon footprint includes landfilling and
          incineration, since sadly, its recycle rate is dismally low
          around the globe.<br>
          <br>
          Plastic trash is also polluting our oceans and washing up on
          beaches around the world. Tons of plastic from the US and
          Japan are floating in the Pacific Ocean, killing mammals and
          birds. Perhaps this tragedy is best captured in the TED
          presentation by Capt. Charles Moore of the Algalita Marine
          Research Foundation.<br>
          <br>
          Using less, or use it better?<br>
          <br>
          Thankfully, there are those who fully appreciate that plastic
          has a higher energy value than anything else commonly found in
          the waste stream. A Japanese company called Blest created a
          small, very safe and easy to use machine that can convert
          several types of plastic back into oil.<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
          "If we burn the plastic, we generate toxins and a large amount
          of CO2. If we convert it into oil, we save CO2 and at the same
          time increase people’s awareness about the value of plastic
          garbage. " — Akinori Ito, CEO of Blest.<br>
          <br>
          Though Japan has much improved its “effective utilization”
          rate over the years to 72% in 2006, that leaves 28% of plastic
          to be buried in landfills or burned. According to Plastic
          Waste Management Institute data, “effective utilization”
          includes not just the 20% that is actually recycled, but also
          52% that is being incinerated for “energy recovery” purposes,
          i.e., generating heat or electric power.<br>
          <br>
          “If we burn the plastic, we generate toxins and a large amount
          of CO2. If we convert it into oil, we save CO2 and at the same
          time increase people’s awareness about the value of plastic
          garbage,” says Akinori Ito, CEO of Blest.<br>
          <br>
          Blest’s conversion technology is very safe because it uses a
          temperature controlling electric heater rather than flame. The
          machines are able to process polyethylene, polystyrene and
          polypropylene (numbers 2-4) but not PET bottles (number 1).
          The result is a crude gas that can fuel things like generators
          or stoves and, when refined, can even be pumped into a car, a
          boat or motorbike. One kilogram of plastic produces almost one
          liter of oil. To convert that amount takes about 1 kilowatt of
          electricity, which is approximately ¥20 or 20 cents’ worth.<br>
          <br>
          The company makes the machines in various sizes and has 60 in
          place at farms, fisheries and small factories in Japan and
          several abroad.<br>
          <br>
          “To make a machine that anyone can use is my dream,” Ito says.
          “The home is the oil field of the future.”<br>
          <br>
          Perhaps that statement is not as crazy as it sounds, since the
          makeup of Japanese household waste has been found to contain
          over 30 % plastic, most of it from packaging.<br>
          <br>
          Continually honing their technology, the company is now able
          to sell the machines for less than before, and Ito hopes to
          achieve a product “that any one can buy.” Currently the
          smallest version, shown in the videobrief, costs ¥950,000 (US
          $9,500).<br>
          <br>
          <b>Changing how we think</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          But it is the educational application of the small model of
          the machine that Ito is most passionate about. He’s taken it
          on planes on many occasions as part of a project that began
          some years ago in the Marshall Islands. There he worked with
          local government and schools to teach people about recycling
          culture and the value of discarded plastic, spreading the
          Japanese concept of mottainai, the idea that waste is sad and
          regrettable.<br>
          <br>
          In such remote places, the machine also serves as a practical
          solution to the plastic problem, much of it left behind by
          tourists: the oil produced is used for tour buses or boats,
          Ito says.<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
          Plastic’s carbon footprint includes landfilling and
          incineration, since sadly, its recycle rate is dismally low
          around the globe.<br>
          <br>
          “Teaching this at schools is the most important work that I
          do,” Ito reflects. In Japan too, he visits schools where he
          shows children, teachers and parents how to convert the
          packaging and drinking straws leftover from lunch.<br>
          <br>
          If we were to use only the world’s plastic waste rather than
          oil from oil fields, CO2 emissions could be slashed
          dramatically, he says.<br>
          <br>
          “It’s a waste isn’t it?” Ito asks. “This plastic is every
          where in the world, and everyone throws it away.”<br>
          <br>
          <b>A mountain to climb down</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          The wonderful invention of plastics has spawned a huge problem
          that we are struggling to solve. With peak oil looming, things
          are set to change, but we find ourselves on top of an oil and
          plastic mountain, and the only way forward is down.<br>
          <br>
          So while many solutions like this are not without hiccups or
          detractors, they are a step forward in coming to terms with
          our oil and plastics dependence and help raise awareness of
          the carbon footprint of its production and use. Somehow we all
          know that plastics is a habit we need to kick. But that
          doesn’t seem to make it any easier.<br>
          <br>
          Perhaps the best thing you can do is to look more deeply into
          this issue. A good place to start is the 2008 Addicted to
          Plastic documentary from Cryptic Moth productions. You can
          watch the trailer online and maybe request it at your local
          video rental store.<br>
          <br>
          According to the blurb, “the film details plastic’s path over
          the last 100 years and provides a wealth of expert interviews
          on practical and cutting edge solutions to recycling, toxicity
          and biodegradability.”<br>
          <br>
          Next it is just a matter of taking action to break our love
          affair with plastic.<br>

      </div>
      <br>
      ...Gizmag spoke with Cynar CEO Michael Murray via telephone, who
      explained that the company converts ELP typically destined for
      landfills into useful diesel. The conversion involves pyrolysis,
      which is the process of thermal degradation of a material in the
      absence of oxygen - so heating, but no burning, takes place.<br>
      <br>
      ELP is broken down into gases by the pyrolysis process, then put
      through a specially-designed condenser system in order to produce
      a mixture equivalent to petroleum distillates. This is then
      further treated to produce liquid fuel, while leftover gases are
      diverted back into the furnaces which heat the plastics.
      Interestingly, the diesel produced by this method is actually
      claimed more efficient and lower in sulfur than generic diesel.<br>
      <br>
      The only waste material left over from the ELP-to-diesel
      conversion process is roughly five percent char, which can also be
      put to use in the building industry for concrete and tile
      manufacturing.<br>
      <br>
      Each Cynar plant can produce up to 19,000 liters (around 5,000 US
      gallons) of fuel from 20 tons of ELP per day. For the roughly
      4,000 liters (1,000 US gallons) of fuel that Rowsell's flight will
      consume, approximately five tons of waste plastic will be

      <b>Abstract<br>
      </b>A process is described for treating waste plasties material to
      provide at least one on-specification fuel product. Plasties
      material is melted (4) and then pyrolysed in an oxygen-free
      atmosphere to provide pyrolysis gases. The pyrolysis gases are
      brought into contact with plates (13) in a contactor vessel (7) so
      that some long chain gas components condense and return to be
      further pyrolysed to achieve thermal degradation. Short chain gas
      components exit the contactor in gaseous form; and proceed to
      distillation to provide one or more on-specification fuel
      products. There is a pipe (12) directly linking the pyrolysis
      chamber (6) to the contactor (7), suitable for conveying
      upwardly-moving pyrolysis gases and downwardly-flowing long-chain
      liquid for thermal degradation. There is a vacuum distillation
      tower (26) for further processing of liquid feeds from the first
      (atmospheric) distillation column (20). It has been found that
      having thermal degradation in the contactor and pyrolysis chamber
      and by having a second, vacuum, distillaton column helps to
      provide a particularly good quality on-specification liquid fuel.<br>

      Converting rubber and plastic to oil and gas - Global Resource
      Corporation (GRC) is reducing plastics back to oil and combustible
      gas using 1200 different frequencies within the microwave range,
      which act on specific hydrocarbon materials. This video
      demonstrates taking 100 grams of ground up tires and turning it
      into oil and gas (mostly diesel range)...<br>
      <p>"To everything there is a frequency that excites its molecules
        best. Just like the 2450MHz frequency magnetron in your kitchen
        microwave oven which is specific to water (H2O) molecules, GRC’s
        hydrocarbon specific frequencies are generated by much higher RF
        klystrons that actually crack the hydrocarbon chain into its
        characteristic fuels. </p>
      <p>"By definition it is not pyrolysis because cracking the
        hydrocarbon chain is inherent to specific frequencies and has
        little to do with the amount of heat generated. The process
        however is done without water and performed in an oxygen starved
        environment. We call this technology: <b>High-Frequency
          Attenuating Wave Kinetics</b> or HAWK for short. </p>
      <p>"There is also no CO2 or CO produced in the process because
        there is no oxidation other than possibly a miniscule amount
        that may be pre-existing in the material or minerals processed.
        GRC’s vacuum environment creates an accelerated pressure thereby
        assimilating what Mother Nature has done through countless years
        to make fuels. </p>
      <p>"The two basic elements offered for all GRC’s applications are
        in situ and off situ. We have designed klystron machinery for
        gasifying hydrocarbons where they exist or in fabricated
        systems. In-situ meaning processed deep in the ground, rock
        formations or anywhere naturally occurring and off-situ meaning
        processed above ground that is mined or material removed from
        site. </p>

      <b></b><b>Abstract</b><br>
      Pyrolysis of HDPE waste grocery bags followed by distillation
      resulted in a liquid hydrocarbon mixture with average structure
      consisting of saturated aliphatic paraffinic hydrogens (96.8%),
      aliphatic olefinic hydrogens (2.6%) and aromatic hydrogens (0.6%)
      that corresponded to the boiling range of conventional petroleum
      diesel fuel (#1 diesel 190–290 °C and #2 diesel 290–340 °C).
      Characterization of the liquid hydrocarbon mixture was
      accomplished with gas chromatography–mass spectroscopy, infrared
      and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopies, size exclusion
      chromatography, and simulated distillation. No oxygenated species
      such as carboxylic acids, aldehydes, ethers, ketones, or alcohols
      were detected. Comparison of the fuel properties to the
      petrodiesel fuel standards ASTM D975 and EN 590 revealed that the
      synthetic product was within all specifications after addition of
      antioxidants with the exception of density (802 kg/m3). Notably,
      the derived cetane number (73.4) and lubricity (198 µm, 60 °C,
      ASTM D6890) represented significant enhancements over those of
      conventional petroleum diesel fuel. Other fuel properties included
      a kinematic viscosity (40 °C) of 2.96 mm2/s, cloud point of 4.7
      °C, flash point of 81.5 °C, and energy content of 46.16 MJ/kg. In
      summary, liquid hydrocarbons with appropriate boiling range
      produced from pyrolysis of waste plastic appear suitable as blend
      components for conventional petroleum diesel fuel.<br>

          pyrolysis reactor</b><br>

      <br>
      The video shows how I am improving my combustion chamber to
      minimize heat loss. During the video I will answer the most asked
      questions and give you all the information you need to build your
      own plastic waste to oil reactor. So lets dive straight into the
      fun! <br>
      <br>
      To begin you need some spray glue ceramic insulating material and
      a respirator. As you can see the Insulation in my old chamber is
      quite thin which decreases the heat efficiency and increases the
      amount of gas I need to heat the system. Additionally, is the
      refractory cement coating cracked in several places and needs a
      work over. To build your combustion chamber in which you will heat
      your reaction vessel you need a shell. I used some thin steal
      sheet and bend it into the diameter I needed. But you can use
      anything if it can handle a temperature of around 100°C. An
      example for this would be an old metal drum or a big paint can. It
      all depends on the size of the system you want to build. So now
      you must loosely attach the insulation material to the wall of
      your shell I used spray glue for this because it was very easy to
      do. The respirator is mandatory, so you don´t breath in any glue.
      You can use other insulation material like stone wool or
      refractory. An important information is that you should use a
      insulation material that has a low heat capacity like stone wool
      or ceramic because the reaction chamber heats ups much quicker and
      you don´t waste to much energy on heating up your insulation
      material. A negative example is refractory cement it stores a lot
      of heat and leads to a long heat up phase and a long cool down and
      so wastes a lot of energy. But One thing to consider is that the
      refractory cement is way cheaper and if poured correctly yields a
      strong and resistant insulation. Insulating the chamber using
      ceramic fiber or stone wool is very easy. You cut the sheets you
      have into the right size sprays glue them together and fill up the
      gaps using the leftovers. For this step it is important that you
      cut the insulation in a way that you have very big pieces because
      through every gap heat will escape. To minimize this effect work
      with a double layer like I am. Alternate the positions where your
      gaps are in such a way that all gaps have the maximum distance to
      each over and none of them are on top of each over. This will help
      you keep the heat in your chamber. When working with ceramic fiber
      or stone wool you must wear a respirator because fine particles of
      these materials can lead to irritation and lung damage.
      Furthermore, I strongly advise you to wear long clothing because
      after I had finished the insulation my arms were itchy which maybe
      due to the ceramic fibers that came in contact with my skin. <br>
      <br>
      So now that we have discussed how to build the combustion chamber
      lets us progress to the second step which is building the reaction
      chamber. The only material that works good for reaction chamber is
      metal that should be at least 1.5 millimeters in thickness. You
      need this wall thickness because the conditions you are putting
      the reaction chamber in require durability. At the temperature of
      around 400 to 600°C the reactor is operating metal is already
      softening and the corrosion rate is drastically increased. So to
      ensure the safety of the whole system do not use a chamber with
      less wall thickness. <br>
      <br>
      I used a very large steel pipe and closed one end by welding in a
      metal plate. After this you need a flange that ensures your system
      is gastight and doesn´t let of toxic vapor. The best thing to use
      here is a weld neck flange that gets welded into the other side of
      the reaction chamber. Just buy the flange size you find fitting
      for your setup. It is important that you put the flange in a
      position where no liquid contacts because this allows you to use
      gas sealing rope instead of very expansive seals. I have used
      ISOTHERM 800 from the company Frenzelit and it worked quite well.
      If you want to know how to install the gas sealing watch my first
      video on the waste to fuel project. When the reaction chamber
      is&nbsp; completed you need pipes and a condenser. It is very
      important to note that the pipe coming from the reaction chamber
      that leads to the condenser has a significant impact on the oil
      you are producing. All along the connection pipe the vapor will
      condensate and reflux. Reflux is the term chemist use to describe
      that a liquid is boiled of and then condenses and drips back into
      the boiling flask. In this case the boiling flask is our reaction
      chamber. This reflux leads to more thermal cracking which reduces
      the amount of liquid oil and increases the amount of gas you are
      producing. One thing to note is that with more reflux you get a
      lighter oil which means the hydrocarbon chains are shorter.To put
      this into simpler terms the longer your connection pipe the
      shorter your hydrocarbons are. To build the condenser I advise you
      to go with a simple Liebig type design because it is easy to build
      and minimizes the risk that your condenser gets blocked. Building
      a Liebig condenser is easy just weld a smaller pipe into a bigger
      one. Then connect the inner pipe to a threated pipe so you can
      connect the condenser to the other pipes in your setup. Drill two
      holes in the condenser shell and weld on two small pipes where the
      cooling water hose gets connected. It is hard to give an
      estimation on how long the condenser should be. I advise you to go
      with the more is better approach because if the condenser is to
      short you will get into trouble. So now that we have some basics
      about the combustion and the reaction chamber let us lock at
      possible improvements. For this you must prepare some refractory
      cement and cut fitting pieces out of refractory stone. To prepare
      the cement you just have to combine the refractory cement and
      water and mix it well. This is done until the cement has the right
      consistency. The refractory stone will serve as the base of the
      reaction chamber because the soft ceramic fiber would be
      compressed by the weight of the reaction chamber thus decreasing
      its insulation capacity. The refractory stone pieces must be
      soaked in water to ensure that the refractory cement hardens in
      the right rate. When the stones have been soaked, a generous
      amount of refractory cement is applied, and the pieces are pressed
      against the wall. This is done until all the refractory stone
      pieces are in their right place. The trowel is used to fill gaps
      and scrape of excess cement. This bottom lining with refractory
      stone increases the efficiency of the whole system but ads a lot
      of weight to it which can lead to problems in a portable version
      like mine. So now I want to speak about the process in general and
      the materials you can and can not use. The so-called pyrolysis is
      a process in which log chain hydrocarbons are heated in the
      absence of oxygen.<br>

      <div align="center"><b>Plastic Waste Becomes Fuel For Vehicles In
          This Simple Reactor</b><br>
        <b>by Andrea D. Steffen</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      <b> </b>Walter Rosner is a metallurgist and researcher who
      designed and manufactured a reactor to turn plastic waste into
      fuel. He did this from the small missionary town Dos de Mayo in
      Argentina where no such machine had ever existed; therefore, he
      had to invent it himself. Now, he uses the oven to melt standard
      plastic from packaging and other sources and distills it down to
      diesel or gasoline for vehicles and machines.<br>
      <br>
      Rosner proposed building a facility in each municipality that
      would collect plastic and turn it into fuel. The size of each
      plant should be scaled according to how much garbage the region
      produces.<br>
      <br>
      One reactor can process 30 kilos of plastic in about 90 minutes.
      For every 10 kilos put in, nine liters of fuel comes out. Even
      agrochemical packaging such as glyphosate can be transformed into
      a usable product. Different plastics produce different types of
      fuel (naphtha, diesel, or oil), and some plastics take longer than
      others to convert.<br>
      <br>
      Rosner’s household accumulates around 8 kilos of plastic waste
      weekly, which, when converted in the reactor provides 5 liters of
      gasoline. To put it into perspective, here in Thailand, I use a
      motorbike to get around. I have to fill it once a week with three
      liters of gasoline. The amount of plastic Rosner’s household
      throws away could provide me with almost double my fuel needs for
      the week! However, I rarely have plastic to throw away (or
      recycle) because my diet barely involves things packaged in
      single-use plastic. No soda, no junk food, almost no plastic!<br>
      <br>
      Of course, I also live on a small island with lots of small local
      farms selling fruits in vegetables from market stalls, and many
      places around the world are not like this. It may not be possible
      for some people to avoid plastic. For this, Rosner’s reactor is
      terrific because it accelerates the plastic decomposition process
      from hundreds of years to merely three hours.<br>
      <br>
      He said: In three hours, you have fuel suitable for cars,
      machines, generator sets, chainsaws.<br>
      <br>
      Meanwhile, in Africa, there’s another man from Ghana called
      Francis Kantavooro, who also assembled his own reactor. It turns
      plastic waste into either diesel, gasoline, kerosene, or domestic
      gas for home use.<br>
      <br>
      Kantavooro said: Ghana spends [a lot of] money on plastic waste.
      When I was at university as an engineer, I wanted to make a
      change. I started to research what the plastic waste could be used
      for and [how to] permanently get it out of the environmental
      system.<br>
      <br>
      Ghana has a severe plastic pollution problem as it produces 1.7
      million tons of it annually but only recycles 2%! Now, at least in
      his town, people collect plastic waste and bring it to the reactor
      site. They receive money per kilo. It takes no longer than a day
      for Kantavooro’s reactor to convert one ton of plastic into 800
      liters of diesel. Likewise, people from the town come to him to
      buy fuel for their motorbikes and machines as it is cheaper than
      buying it from the gas station.<br>
