      <p>Invited Paper: The Tesla Centennial Symposium, IEEE Pikes Peak
        Section, Colorado Springs CO (August 12, 1984) </p>
      <p>This paper will describe a novel method and means of defense
        against the global omnipresence of ELF emissions and other
        electromagnetic pollution. The use of ELF magnetic emissions in
        contemporary undeclared warfare is so new that there is little
        knowledge about it amongst both the lay public and experts in
        warfare. Therefore, this paper will rely on the history of the
        development of ELF warfare starting with Nikola Tesla’s
        pioneering work in the 1890s; its contemporary use by several
        nations; and some new research carried out by the author. This
        background material is to be found in Reference 1, an
        unpublished manuscript written by the inventor. </p>
      <p>We begin with a description of an objective method of measuring
        a person’s susceptibility to electro-encephalographic (EEG)
        entrainment with respect to magnetic pulses, visual photonic
        pulses, and auditory sound pulses. From this data set there is
        calculated a specific set of magnetic pulse frequencies,
        typically between 7 to 10 Hz that protects that individual from
        “negative” ELF magnetic waves. This protection extends to all
        man-made environmental electromagnetic pollution. Reference 2
        proves that the magnetic component of electromagnetic pollution
        can be mutagenic in human tissue. This is the great danger of
        electromagnetic pollution. </p>
      <p>We then describe the three components of the
        electromagnetic&nbsp; pollution (EMPe) and extremely low
        frequency magnetic&nbsp; (ELFm) shielding device. We then show
        how the shielding device effect can be objectively measured.
        First, the ambient EMPe and ambient ELFm pollution is measured
        with a detector coil-amplifier of great sensitivity. A typical
        measurement will show a spread of frequencies ranging from 6 Hz
        to 120 Hz with a measurable average amplitude, and
        characteristic wave shape. Then the three components of the
        shielding device are placed on a person, and the measurements
        repeated. Typically, the ambient frequencies will narrow down to
        7 to 10 Hz with a 3-fold increase in amplitude. These
        frequencies centering on 8 to 9 Hz are biologically beneficial
        frequencies. </p>
      <p>Thus the shielding device performs two important functions: (1)
        cancels out all negative polluting EMPe and ELFm emissions in
        the ambient environment of a person, thus shielded, and (2)
        selectively amplifies certain beneficial ELFm in the ambient
        environment of a shielded person, in the rage of 7 to 10 Hz with
        a peak center frequency of 8 to 9 Hz in the EEG power spectrum.
      </p>
      <p>As a beginning to the theory, and hence of the method of
        operation of the shielding device, I present some brief
        observations of the way in which one human being can direct and
        radiate his natural EEG, i.e., ELFm, a magnetic wave at another
        person, and use them to bring under control the EEG wave system
        of that person, as measured objectively with dual EEG wave
        measurements of the two persons. Observations are also made of
        artificially radiating a person with a magnetic wave generator
        which can produce behavioral modification in the person being
        radiated. </p>
      <p>A theory and method is developed as to how and why ELFm signals
        of the order of 2 x 10-9 Tesla per second (2 nanotesla per
        second) can exert such powerful control effects over biological
        systems. The experimental work that is the foundation of the
        theory and of the method is given in some detail. The theory
        states that external magnetic fields can control biological
        spin-spin proton-proton coupling constants in DNA, RNA,
        RNA-transferases, and hydrons (H2)). Such spin-spin coupling
        constants can be stabilized at equilibrium, against the
        destabilizing external ELFm frequencies. </p>
      <p>Reference 3 shows some of the hysterical press reaction to the
        existence of the Soviet ELF emissions. Reference 4 shows the
        scientific analysis of the phenomena by an engineer. </p>
      <p><b>Description of the Method of Measuring Objectively the
          Sensitivity of an Individual to Brain wave Entrainment from
          Polluting Electromagnetic Emissions ~</b> </p>
      <p>The author discovered many years ago that when two human beings
        interact in the well known "laying on of hands" effect (without
        any body contact) that the brain waves of one of the
        participants will entrain the brainwaves of the other person.
        See Reference 5, pp. 7-9. Later it was discovered that the
        Soviet ELF global emissions could entrain the brain waves of
        certain individuals. Then it was found that by proper training
        individuals could entrain their own brain waves at the Alpha
        Frequencies (7-12 Hz). As a result of such experiments and
        findings the author developed the system shown in Figure 1 which
        can be routinely used to measure the effects of polluting EM
        emissions of the brain waves. These effects on the brainwaves
        are explainable as an effect on the spin-spin proton-proton
        coupling constants of every odd-numbered atom in the human body.
        See Reference 5m pp. 16-21 for the scientific basis of this
        effect. </p>
      <p>Referring to the block diagram of Figure 1 we see that the Head
        (1) of a person is connected via electrodes to an EEG machine
        (6) which has the capability of carrying out a Fourier transform
        analysis of the brain waves in real time. Stimulators (8),
        Strobe Lights (9), ELF Magnetic Wave Generator (12), Audio Wave
        Generator (11), Transdermal Wave Generator (10, Puharich, US
        Patent # 3,563,246) serve to entrain the waves of the brain at
        characteristic frequencies. These entrained waves from the brain
        are cross-correlated by computer analysis to yield a profile of
        frequencies that reveal the particular sensitivities of the
        individual to brain wave entrainment. In addition there is a set
        of monitors that detect the ambient earth and atmospheric
        magnetic waves: ELF Detector Coil (2), ultra-sensitive (0.5
        microTesla/sec.) Amplifier (3), A/D Frequency Counter (4), and
        Oscilloscope (5) to measure the wave shpae and the amplitude of
        the magnetic waves. Systems (3), (4), and (5) are also fed into
        the computer for cross-correlation analysis with the EEG data.
        Thus the system of Figure 1 can measure the effects on the brain
        EEG from the ambient EMPe and ELFm before any use is made of the
        Shield Device on that person. It can also measure the ambient
        EMPe and ELFm after the person has put on the Shield Device. The
        results of this kind of measurement are shown in Figure 3. </p>

      <p><b>Description of the Shield Device which Protects an
          Individual from the Negative Biological and Psychological
          Effects of EMPe and ELFm Polluting Emissions ~</b> </p>
      <p>Reference to Figure 2 shows the block diagram of the Shield
        Device. There are three components of the Shield Device. The
        first component is the metal shielded circuit made up of three
        parts respectively labeled: the Sensor (IV), the Battery (VIII),
        and the Controller (IX), a quartz clock. Now it is to be noted
        that the first component which is in the form and shape of a
        ball point type of pencil, and will be called the pencil
        hereinafter, encloses all of the three parts in a metal Faraday
        type of shield. This means that the the parts are effectively
        shielded against all EM radiation above about 100 Hz. The pencil
        is normally held in the hand and can be used as a working
        ballpoint pen, or it can be worn in a shirt pocket or carried by
        a cord hung around the neck. The only signals that can get
        through the shielding of the pen are: (a) the magnetic brain
        waves of the person wearing it, (b) the ambient neutrino flux
        from deep space, and (c) virtual sub-quantum anenergy from the
        environment. </p>
      <p>Signal (a) is obvious and needs no further explanation. The
        brain wave magnetic vector enters the Sensor IV, and is picked
        up by flat copper braid which is wound in 21 turns on a brass
        spindle, and each turn is rotated, or twisted 180° on each turn.
        This rotates the magnetic wave 180 degrees on each turn, and
        passes on the next turn a magnetic wave that is 180° out of
        phase with it. The result is that the vectors cancel each other,
        and the only wave that passes up to the coil is a scalar
        longitudinal wave. For a definition of the meaning of this term
        see Reference 6, pp. 21-25. The scalar wave, when it reaches the
        positive pole of the battery will orthorotate 180° and release a
        pulse of charge into the battery that is 180° out of phase with
        the pulse charge that has just left the battery at the negative
        pole. This phase control of battery charge emission, and battery
        charge entrance is managed by the oscillations of the quartz
        crystal in the clock which is free-running at 256 Hz. The proof
        of this action is that a battery with a normal life, with load,
        of one year will last for at least 4 years by our latest
        measurements, if not longer. </p>
      <p>But there is a feedback between the human body, and the first
        component, the pencil, which has just been described. There is a
        second component, labeled in Figure 2 as the Magnetic Tape Loop
        (VI), Twistor and Antenna. This is made up of a plastic film
        (0.125 inch wide and 0.001 mil thick) coated on one side with
        magnetite powder (Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>). The plastic film
        is wound on a sheet iron base in the form of a circle that will
        pass over a person’s hand and wrist, and is worn as a bracelet.
        There are 42 turns of the film on the metal circle, and the film
        is twisted 180 degrees each turn, The magnetic tape loop cancels
        all the magnetic vectors of all the frequencies&nbsp; of EMPe
        and ELFm in the ambient environment, and cancels them by the
        phase canceling already described for the pencil. The difference
        is that the magnetic tape loop is not connected to anything ---
        it is an open circuit, and the scalar longitudinal waves are
        dumped into the ambient vacuum. When the first component, the
        pencil, is in skin contact with the person, some of the scalar
        longitudinal waves will enter part IV of the pencil. </p>
      <p>The mechanism of this latter effect is that the quartz
        resonator IX has a feedback to the Copper Band VII of virtual
        photonic energy because the skin is a detector for all kinds of
        waves. See Reference 5, pp. 23-27 for a description of this
        detector effect discovered by the inventor. This copper band
        initiates a loop of virtual energy flow as shown by the dashed
        lines in Figure 2 starting at IX, going to VII through the skin
        and to the opposite arm where it emerges 180° out of phase with
        the entrance signal due to the diode property of the skin, the
        path then goes through the shield into Sensor IV, and by hard
        wire circuitry back to the Controller IX. This is a complete
        circuit path in which a part of the path is hard-wired, and a
        part of the path is a scalar wave, and virtual photon, in
        nature. These different parts of the circuit, i.e., the human
        body, and the three components of the Shield Device come into a
        self-sustaining resonance. The virtual parts of the circuit are
        hyper-spatial, i.e., greater than 4 dimensions, and this is
        proven by the fact that the space in which the detector coil
        sits will remain clear of EMPe and ELFm for 15 minutes to 90
        minutes after the person who wears the Shield Device leaves the
        area by going at least one-half mile away. </p>
      <p>Reference to Figure 3 will show a series of typical
        measurements made in the region of the Detector Coil (2 in
        Figure 1) before and after the introduction of the Shield
        Device. The persistence of a hyperspatial effect is seen in a
        comparison between Figure 3A and Figure 3c when the person with
        the shield Device leaves the ELF Detector Coil region, and goes
        away at a distance of one-half mile. The pattern recorded by the
        ELF Detector Coil remains as shown in Figure 3C. It is to be
        noted by reference to the chart on page 20 in Exhibit E, that
        the beneficial frequencies for the human organism are centered
        on 8 Hz, and reference to Figure 3d shows that the Shield Device
        on a person centers his EEG power spectrum on this center
        frequency at a very high amplitude. This protects the person
        from polluting emissions and magnifies the natural NMR system of
        the biological system. See Reference 7 for an introduction to
        this NMR coupling. </p>

      <p><b>Summary and Conclusions ~</b> </p>
      <p>(1) A Method and Means to measure ambient EM Pollution (EMPe)
        and ambient ELF Magnetic waves (ELFm) in the environment of a
        person, said waves being of a harmful biological and
        psychological nature to humans (Figure 1). </p>
      <p>(2) A Method and Means to protect a human being from such
        harmful emissions with a Shield Device (Figure 2). </p>
      <p>(3) A Method that is based on the known biological spin-spin
        proton-proton couplings, and is used to influence this nuclear
        magnetic resonance (NMR) system to strengthen the biological
        integrity of the human body (Figures 3 and 4). </p>
      <p>(4) The means of the Shield Device which is composed of 3
        parts: </p>
      <p>(a) The Pencil ~ This is a shielded device which serves as a
        sensor and a controller of Scalar Longitudinal Waves, and
        converts normal EMPe and ELFm vector wwaves into scalar waves
        and virtual energy waves, thereby eliminating the vector waves
        in the immediate vicinity of a person. The Sensor is made up of
        21 turns of flat copper braid wound on a brass cylinder, each
        turn of braid being twisted 180 degrees from the preceding turn.
        Braid is connected to the positive pole of the battery, and the
        negative pole of the battery is in series with a free-running
        quartz clock. </p>
      <p>(b) A Magnetic Flat Film Loop (MFFL) ~ 42 turns, each of which
        is twisted 180° from the previous turn. This circular flat film
        magnetic coil serves to collect EMPe and ELFm vector waves from
        the ambient environment and convert them to Scalar Longitudinal
        waves which are not harmful to man. There is a virtual coupling
        between the pencil circuit, and the MFFL. A person wears the
        MFFL on his body skin, preferably on his wrist. </p>
      <p>(c) A Flat Copper Bracelet ~ Preferably an open loop, that is
        worn on the wrist. Additional copper bracelets may be worn on
        the body in order to lower the center frequency of the EEG to 8
        Hz. </p>
