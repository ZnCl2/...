      </center>
      <p>“Scientists in Florida have discovered a new form of
        electromagnetic radiation which propagates under water as well
        as radio does in air”. </p>
      <p>“I must protest. Has a serious trade journal resorted to
        sensationalism? It appears that either that either a hoax is
        being perpetrated or that…”. </p>
      <p>“A new mode of communications --- via underwater
        electromagnetic radiation --- is being explored by Hydronics
        Corp. Wallace Minto, inventor of the system, says signals have
        been transmitted over a distance as great as 30 miles by this
        method.”. </p>
      <p>Is “hydronic radiation” a fact or a fraud? It has raised a
        storm of controversy as illustrated by the quotations above, all
        of which were written by responsible engineers or technical
        writers. The fact is that hydronic radiation does work. And the
        equipment is easy to build once a basic understanding of the new
        concept is attained. </p>
      <p>But first, let’s see how the system’s inventor describes
        hydronic radiation. Wallace Minto of Sarasota, FL, desribes it
        as “a new vector field related to the electromagnetic and
        magnetohydrodynamic forces, characteristically propagated
        through a water medium and associated with electronic
        oscillations”. Translation: Hydronic radiation is the same as
        radio, except that it works through water instead of air. </p>
      <p>Only the antennas distinguish the hydronic-radiation system
        from a conventional radio system. Receiving and transmitting
        antennas both have large plates, at each end of an
        insulating&nbsp; separator, to make contact with the water. A
        half-wave radio antenna has insulators on each end and radiates
        at right angles to the wire, as shown in Fig. 1-A. The hydronic
        radiation antenna appears to radiate off the ends of its plates
        (Fig. 1-B). </p>
      <p>Early hydronic radiation experiments were made in the salt
        water of the Atlantic Ocean, and it’s in the oceans that the
        most exciting possibilities for hydronic radiation systems
        exist. Static-free communication between ships, dependable
        communication with submarines, and trans-Atlantic communication
        without cables have all been suggested by the concepts
        proponents. </p>
      <p>But hydronic radiation also works through the fresh water found
        in lakes and rivers. As a matter of fact, the transmitter
        described here can be used in ordinary tap water to perform
        experiments in your bathtub. </p>
      <p>When working in water, it’s dangerous to use AC-powered
        equipment; the transmitter, therefore, is designed to operate
        from a 9-volt transistor radio battery. Power drain is low, and
        the battery will last for many hours. The transmitter schematic
        is shown in Fig. 2. Q1 is the rf oscillator, tuned by L1 to
        transmit in the standard broadcast band, allowing use of an
        ordinary transistor-type AM radio as a receiver. Q2 is an audio
        oscillator, operating at about 1 KHz, which modulates Q1 through
        transformer T. The tone-modulated signal stands out clearly
        among the regular stations and thus makes testing easier. </p>
      <p>The transmitter is built in a 5 x 7 x 3-inch aluminum box, with
        all components mounted on a perforated board except for L1 and
        the terminal strip. These are mounted on one end of the box.
        Standard construction techniques are used. And parts placement
        and lead length are not critical. </p>
      <p>L1 is modified by winding a 25-turn coupling coil at its lower
        end. The two terminal marked TRANSMIT are used as the on-off
        switch. When the terminals are connected by a shorting wire, the
        transmitter will operate. </p>
      <p>To test the transmitter, leave the box open and place a
        transistor radio next to the circuit board. Tune across the band
        and listen for the modulated tone signal. It should appear
        between 550 and 800 KHz. If you can’t find it, set the receiver
        dial at 550 KHz and tune L1 until the tone is received. </p>
      <p>The transistor radio becomes our hydronic radiation receiver
        with a simple modification. Open the case and wind 25 turns of
        No. 24 enameled wire around it ferrite-loop antenna. Leave about
        6 inches of wire at each end of the winding and twist the ends
        together to hold the winding in place. Bring the wires out of
        the case and snap the cover shut to hold them in place. </p>
      <p>Two identical antennas are needed, one for the transmitter and
        one for the receiver. Fig. 3 illustrates the simple
        construction. End plates are 2 inches square, of 18-gauge brass
        cleaned to the bare metal to make good contact with the water.
        The 6-inch spacer can be of Bakelite, Lucite or other insulating
        material. </p>
      <p>Two 6-foot lengths of plastic-insulated hookup wire are used
        for the feeder. One wire is connected to each plate by a solder
        lug passed over the end of the plate, then fed through holes in
        the spacer which allow the wires to be stretched taut. The rest
        of the wire is twisted together to make a balanced feed line. </p>
      <p>Strip the enamel insulation from the ends of the antenna-feeder
        wires and from the two receiver leads, then solder them
        together. Tape the connections to prevent shorting. </p>
      <p>Connect the second antenna to the transmitter. Place the
        antennas close together and check to see that the tone-modulated
        signal can still be heard at 550 KHz. Adjust L1 if necessary. </p>
      <p>Final equipment checks should be made with the antenna in the
        water. A pool of water at least the size of a bathtub is needed,
        and the water should be a foot or more deep. Place the antennas
        facing each other about 3 feet apart. Retune the receiver to
        find the tone. It will appear at about 700 KHz (the water loads
        the transmitter heavily and shifts its frequency). </p>
      <p>To make sure that the hydronic radiation signals are being
        received through the water, lift the receiving antenna out of
        the water. The signal should disappear or at least drop
        considerably in volume. </p>
      <p>With the gear ready, we can perform a few experiments, to see
        how the system operates. A few questions may be answered, and a
        few more may be raised. </p>
      <p><b>Hydronic-Radiation Experiments</b> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;One of the interesting characteristics of a hydronic
        radiation communications system is the apparent directional
        pattern of its antennas. </p>
      <p>Place the antenna underwater with the end plates parallel to
        each other. Rotate one antenna 90° horizontally or vertically so
        the edges o its end plates are perpendicular to the other
        antenna’s end plates. The signal will fade as you rotate,
        disappearing completely at the 90° position. As you turn toward
        180° , the signal will come back and become strong again as the
        end plates once again become parallel. This experiment appears
        to show that the antennas radiate off the ends of the plates. </p>
      <p>Antenna engineers, however, say, “No. The signal does not
        radiate from the surface of the plates”. Instead, they explain,
        the signal radiates from the wires that connect the plates.
        These wires actually form a dipole antenna; the plates, they
        say, are just “ground rods”. Furthermore, the signals so not go
        straight through the water at all. They travel from the
        transmitting antenna upward to the surface of the water, along
        the surface, then back down to the receiving antenna. </p>
      <p>This description of hydronic radiation suggests that the
        behavior of signal radiation is opposed to our general
        experience. It is true that a horizontal-wire antenna will
        radiate its signal upward. The up-over-down theory implies that
        when hydronic waves reach the surface of the water, they must
        bend at right angles to travel along the surface. Then, when
        they are above the receiving antenna, they must bend downward to
        the antenna can pick them up. </p>
      <p><b>Long-Range Antennas</b> </p>
      <p>The maximum distance for effective communication by hydronic
        radiation depends on the spacing between the antenna plates. The
        greater the spacing, the longer the range. Plate spacings of
        1,000 feet have been used to communicate over several miles. </p>
      <p>For our experiment, a plate spacing of 6 feet is convenient and
        will provide a range of 100 feet or&nbsp; more. The antenna will
        use a 6-foot 2 x 3 wood spacer and 1-foot square brass plates.
        The plates don’t have to be that big, but they must be heavy
        enough so the antenna will sink in the water (the wood spacer
        tends to float, of course). A good electrical connection is made
        to each plate, the connecting wires are brought directly to the
        center of the antenna and twisted to form the transmission line,
        which should be about 15 feet long. As before, two identical
        antennas are required. </p>
      <p><b>Up-Over-Down Experiment</b> </p>
      <p>The antennas should be placed about 50 feet apart in water at
        least 6 feet deep. With the antennas just below the surface and
        pointed at each other, the signal should be received loud and
        clear. Now, if both antennas are slowly lowered deeper into the
        water, the distance between them being kept the same, we observe
        an interesting result. The deeper the antennas go, the weaker
        the signal becomes. If we put the antennas deep enough, the
        signal disappears completely. Since the distance between the end
        plates hasn’t changed, we would expect the signal to become
        weaker as the antennas go deeper into the water. Since the
        signal is, in fact, weaker with the antennas deeply submerged,
        our experiment shows that the antenna engineers are right. The
        signal probably does go up-over-down. </p>
      <p><b>Future of Hydronic Radiation</b> </p>
      <p>One experiment seems to prove that hydronic radiation travels
        off the ends of the antenna plates. Another seems to prove the
        signal somehow goes up-over-down. Is there an experiment that
        could prove that neither explanation is correct? If so,
        engineers haven’t discovered it. But there is no reason you
        can’t experiment with your radiation transmitter to see what
        conclusions might be drawn. After all, the las word on the
        concept isn’t in yet. </p>
      <p>So far, experimenters are strongly divided on whether hydronic
        radiation actually is a different form of electromagnetic
        radiation that will prove useful in underwater communication
        systems. One cap holds that rf energy generated by the hydronic
        transmitter is radiated through water in much the same manner as
        it would be through the air, though with some differences.
        Obviously the circuits employed are identical in equipment used
        for both propagation media: air and water. The second group
        feels that there is some basically different phenomenon at work,
        one that promises efficient underwater communication. </p>
      <p>Only extensive experimentation under carefully controlled
        conditions will provide the complete answer, of course. But, you
        can explore a phenomenon that’s in the news today, and do it
        with very little cash outlay. The hydronic transmitter does
        work; why it does isn’t apparent, at the moment. <br>
