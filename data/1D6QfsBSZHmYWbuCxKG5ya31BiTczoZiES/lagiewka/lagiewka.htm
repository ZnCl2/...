        Subject: New Revolutionary Car Buffer patent<br>

      <p align="center"><b>RIDDLES OF THE MECHANICS</b> </p>
      <center>
        <p><b>JANUSZ ZAGÓRSKI</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>In November 1998 in the local stadium, in the presence of
        hundreds of people including representatives of media from the
        all country, together with his collaborators,&nbsp; Przemyslaw
        Lagiewka demonstrated the prototype of an unusual bumper. This
        showed what, was so unusual that continually acknowledged as
        impossible. </p>
      <p>A small Fiat 126p, going 45 km per hour, was driven into a
        concrete wall. The bumper was not damaged. The driver wore no
        seatbelts. The inertial reaction, which should have thrown him
        onto the hood, did not ocur. The stopping distance was only 16
        centimetres. Impossible? Yet hundreds of people in, and&nbsp;
        the stadium, and millions more on television. The use in all
        vehicles of the absorber of the energy, "Ecollision", can
        radically improve automobile safety. </p>
      <p>Lagiewka says, "The technical idea behind my buffer can be used
        in very many practical solutions. Another invention which I
        showed experimentally, is the brake. Connected to the axis on a
        Mercedes, the car stopped in one-quarter of the distance usually
        required". </p>
      <p>I had a short conversation with the manager of the Chair of the
        Mechanics and Energy-Devices AGH in Cracow, with the professor
        with Stanislaus Gumu??.: </p>
      <p>- What you feels about the Lagiewka buffer ? </p>
      <p>- This is a very original solution transforming the rectilinear
        motion into rotatory, thanks to which it succeeded to limit
        radically results of the collision of two bodies. This
        experiment recommends however to us, to research workers, many
        practical and theoretical problems. </p>
      <p>- This means that one cannot give the binding scientific
        opinion? </p>
      <p>- Unfortunately, not yet. We have from several months the small
        model of the vehicle Lagiewki with installed absorber of the
        energy, but are problems with an execution of measurement of
        physical parameters of this event. We want to make this with
        several methods. The thing is that the event lasts several
        milliseconds, and devices which we have at our disposal, are not
        disposed on such small times. Filming of the event little gives,
        because the alloy {stop}-the cage lasts too long [?]. Diodes,
        what we assemble on the model, to measure accelerations, do not
        light with such frequency, to catch sensitively the moment of
        the collision. We seek also suitable sensors of the power. </p>
      <p>- Whether solution Lagiewki surrenders unsophisticatedly to
        explain aground well-known laws of physics? </p>
      <p>- Some elements of this occurrence can not be situated in
        hitherto existing well-known interpretations of the laws of
        physics. As far as more easily one can to himself explain the
        lack of the damage of the car at the collision shown in the
        stadium in Kovars, insomuch more with difficulty interpret the
        fact that the driver, not having buttoned belts, did not fly
        through the windowpane. Doubtless this matter demands serious
        research. Lagiewki's inventions can find wide use in the future.
      </p>
      <p>Lagiewski offers examples of uses for the invention. Thanks
        properly to constructed absorbers of the energy large ships can
        stop, not in 2-3 kilometres, as now, but in 100-200 metres. One
        can also build rescue-landings for people jumping during fires
        from high buildings. In Kovars, at the local firestation, on a
        6-metre tower, tests were made by jumping onto the buffer... </p>
      <p>All mechanics is based on occurrences happening in collisions
        only two bodies and from such experiments are derived
        mathematical calculations. One did not trace, what happens, when
        three bodies simultaneously crash. Lagiewska tested 3-boy
        collisions for 20 years. The results of his research and
        experiments are shocking. And so at collisions of three bodies
        one can control the situation, so that the energy two crashing
        masses of greater bodies almost en bloc swim to the third
        smaller mass. I had personally a possibility to observe an
        experiment erected in the local House of the Culture. The
        arrangement of three situated vehicles on tracks provides a
        completely surprising occurrence. The small vehicle, striking
        simultaneously into 3 the bodies, the most of the energy gave
        back this to two standing from one side to movement. Into the
        third place of the shock, lying on the line of the movement of
        the vehicle, went least the energy. The kinetic energy of the
        vehicle chose another way than standing straight on the object.
        Basing on such among other things experiments, Lagiewka builds
        on the new mechanics. She throws rejects many hitherto existing
        notions and uses new mathematical levellings. Polish
        scientific-technical certers are examining Lagiewki's
        inventions.<br>

          Lagiewska’s bumper, a device that was supposed to disperse
          kinetic force of the impact was a phenomenon in the 90’s. But
          only a media phenomenon. However today, Lucjan Lagiewka is
          working on a road barrier. And he has almost 3mln PLN to use.<br>
          <br>
          The case of “Lagiewka’s bumper” up to now evokes emotions. In
          the 90’s inventor – Lucjan Lagiewka – show a bumper that
          survived an impact with a Fiat 126p speeding 40km/h. The rule
          of its work is supposed to be based on taking over the kinetic
          energy impact and passing it on a circular movement special
          mechanism of rotors.<br>
          <br>
          Up to today no car company hadn’t bought or used such bumper.
          Why? According to conspiracy theories – the project was
          blocked, because it would decrease the companies income. The
          inventor after years told the media that Military Intel was
          looking very closely into his project. According to others –
          because Lagiewska wasn’t completely able to scientifically
          explain what he has constructed. It’s confirmed by professor
          Stanislaw Gumula, ex science employee in AGH, according to who
          the process of work of this device cannot be explained with
          any known today physics laws.<br>
          <br>
          <b>The barrier will save and flash</b><br>
          <br>
          Today Gumula is working with Lagiewka on EPAR project. Within
          it there are new unexplained techniques of kinetic energy
          dispersing designed. One of them is a road barrier which
          absorbs the impacts energy. As we can read on the projects
          website, it’s based on using a “system of mechanized rotor
          accumulators, intercepting and dispersing the impact energy”.
          According to the inventors such barrier not only will cause
          less damages of the car but also will reduce ostensible
          forces. She will also produce electricity thanks to the
          impact. “Thanks to using the intercepted impact energy in
          every barrier a self supplying light warning system will be
          possible to implement and an automatic alarm call to rescue
          forces” – praise the constructors.<br>
          <br>
          <b>EU project worth almost 3mln PLN</b><br>
          <br>
          It sound a little bit like fantasy? It does. But the project
          received real cash. EPAR SP. z o. o. (place in Lódz) received
          support for research and development works regarding the
          barrier. 2 960 787 PLN was given from the Operational
          Programme – Innovative Economy for the project called “Safety
          road barriers a dynamic solution for absorbing the kinetic
          energy of an impact”.<br>
          <br>
          The project is supported from EU funds since 2011 and those
          funds will end in December 2013. Will we see crash tests with
          the full scale barrier and a real life car accelerating to for
          example 80 kilometres per hour after that deadline? Not one
          knows. For now inventors convince, that their theory works by
          showing us a model with a ball...<br>
          <br>
          EPAR project isn’t the only innovative project regarding road
          barriers. The Institute for examining roads and bridges has
          constructed an Active Intelligent Road and Bridge Barrier.
          Thanks to electronic structures equipped and modern
          construction solutions the level of impact absorption can be
          adjustet to vehicles of various mass ( a motorcar, a bus car,
          a lorry). The barrier is equipped in a system of video
          cameras, that registers incoming vehicles and is capable of
          forecasting the trajectory&nbsp; – so it can earlier assume
          whether the car will hit the barrier and measure their size.
          Electronic modules are, during that time, able to switch the
          construction on to receiving a particular type of energy.
          Thanks to it the barrier before the actual hit is prepared to
          get hit by a truck or a motorcar. The point of the solution is
          in fluid containers and hoses regulating pressure in them.
          Thanks to them the flexibility of the construction can be
          changed.<br>
          <br>
          <b>These devices work</b><br>
          <br>
          Meantime there are projects already existing, that
          significantly reduce the danger for road users. During a hit
          with a car speeding 100 kilometres per hour you can’t avoid
          for example dents in the car. However, the driver has a big
          chance, that instead of a normal concrete lighting pillar, he
          will run into a pillar made out of a technology not absorbing
          the impact energy. Such crash tests took place this summer in
          Inowroclaw <br>

          <b>Abstract</b> -- The invention is related to a kinetic
          energy absorber, particularly useful for large mobile objects,
          applicable as a bumper in cars, elevators, rail-cars, quays
          and other objects susceptible to the effects of sudden
          collisions. It is characterized by the use of a rotor (4)
          connected to a bumper (6) through a multiplying gear (2).<br>
          <br>
          <b>Description</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          The invention is a kinetic energy absorber, particularly for
          large mobile objects, applicable as a bumper in cars,
          elevators, rail cars, quays and other objects susceptible to
          the effects of sudden collisions.<br>
          <br>
          Kinetic energy absorbers known so far, which are used to
          protect cars against the effects of a potential collision with
          a fixed obstruction, are bumpers with a controlled crushing
          zone. In such cases, the absorbed kinetic energy is converted
          into energy required to deform car's structure.<br>
          <br>
          Kinetic energy absorbers used in rail cars are helical dumper
          springs or elastomer filler inside the bumpers. In this
          solution, the absorbed energy is gradually transformed during
          a collision into potential energy of absorbers' elasticity and
          released afterwards leading to the rebound.<br>
          <br>
          The primary feature of the invention (the kinetic energy
          absorber, applicable particularly to large mobile objects) is
          that it comprises a rotor connected to a bumper via
          multiplying gear.<br>
          <br>
          The efficiency is increased when the multiplying gear is
          connected to the bumper by means of a toothed bar.<br>
          <br>
          The effect is also intensified if the toothed bar and the
          bumper are separated with an elastic element.<br>
          <br>
          Another advantage is achieved when the multiplying gear has
          the form of a toothed gear.<br>
          <br>
          Thanks to the solutions proposed in this invention, it is
          possible to achieve almost total conversion of objects'
          translational energy into rotor's rotational energy.<br>
          <br>
          When applied to various mobile objects the solution protects
          them from damage and keeps the passengers safe from injuries
          or, in extreme cases, even save lives. Items located inside
          the object are secured as well. Rebound from an obstruction
          has also been eliminated.<br>

          The multiplying gear (2) meshed with the gear wheel (3)
          propelling the rotor (4) is installed on a frame (1) which is
          fixed to the potentially colliding object.<br>
          <br>
          The multiplying gear (2) is meshed with the toothed bar (5)
          fixed to the frame in such a way that it is free to slide
          along (1). The toothed bar (5) is equipped with a bumper at
          least from one side.<br>
          <br>
          In some variations of the invention, the toothed bar (5) is
          connected to a bumper through an elastic element (7). In other
          variations the toothed bar is equipped with a bumper (6) on
          both sides.<br>
          <br>
          Yet in other variations, the multiplying gear (2) is propelled
          by a system of pulling rods.<br>
          <br>
          An object in a translational motion has kinetic energy which
          is used for deformation of the object during a collision with
          a fixed rigid obstacle.<br>
          <br>
          In the case of the presented solution, during obstacle's (not
          shown in the figure) interaction with the bumper (6), object's
          kinetic energy is transmitted to the toothed bar (5) and then
          through the multiplying gear (2) to the rotor (4) which makes
          it rotate.<br>
          <br>
          In the course of this process, the kinetic energy of object's
          translational motion is converted into the rotational energy
          of the rotor.<br>
          <br>
          In order to avoid damaging the multiplying gear (2), an
          elastic element (7) should be mounted between the bumper and
          the toothed bar (5).<br>
          <br>
          During tests, the presented absorber was used as a car bumper.
          Normally in the case of a collision with another car or a
          fixed; rigid obstacle, such as a tree or a wall, the kinetic
          energy of a car is converted into deformation energy of the
          car's crashing zone.<br>
          <br>
          The absorber used makes it possible to slow the vehicle down
          to zero without any structural deformation due to its quick
          energy conversion rate.<br>
          <br>
          The vehicle alone contributes only partially to the total
          kinetic energy before the collision as the rest of it comes
          from the passengers and their luggage.<br>
          <br>
          In another application, the absorber can be installed under
          elevator's floor or at the bottom of the shaft. In the case of
          emergency, such as snapped lifting rope, the kinetic energy of
          the falling cabin and its passengers, should be transformed
          into rotational energy of the rotor (4) without exerting any
          substantial force on the falling object.<br>
          <br>
          The absorber can also be installed in rail cars' bumpers. When
          rail cars collide, being linked to the train, their kinetic
          energy is transformed into rotational energy of a rotor (4).
          It protects the cars and their load form damage. The
          protection works with a traveling train as well, eliminating
          all negative effects of kinetic forces.<br>
          <br>
          Yet another possible application is to install the absorbers
          in the quays. It should eliminate the excessive forces that
          ships' sides exert on quay's walls, protecting thus the cargo
          from moving inside the hold.<br>

          angularly deviated from an axis (20) of the input cylinder
          (3), said output cylinders co-operating with pistons (9), the

          <br>
          <b>Description</b><br>
          <br>
          This invention concerns a collision energy dissipating bumper
          in which kinetic energy of progressive motion is converted
          into kinetic energy of rotary motion. This solution is to be
          used especially in motorized vehicles as well as in other
          objects exposed to unexpected collisions.<br>
          <br>
          From patent application WO2004028864 a device for protecting
          vehicles against collision effects is known in which kinetic
          energy suddenly created by a collision is converted into
          kinetic energy of spinning masses.<br>
          <br>
          According to this known solution vehicles are protected
          against collision effects by a bumper comprising a toothed bar
          co-operating with transmissions driving spinning masses. An
          elastic element is situated between a ram and the toothed bar
          in order to decrease an impact during an early phase of a
          collision.<br>
          <br>
          A device for converting kinetic energy is also known from
          specification WO2005121593, said device comprising a ram
          co-operating by a pressure fluid chamber with a unit
          dissipating energy created by a collision. This unit is formed
          as a rack forcing the rotary motion of spinning masses so as
          to smoothly change kinetic energy of progressive motion
          created as a result of the collision into kinetic energy of
          rotary motion.<br>
          <br>
          The object of this invention is to increase the effectiveness
          of impact energy dissipation.<br>
          <br>
          A bumper according to the invention comprises a ram
          co-operating through a pressure fluid chamber with an impact
          energy dissipating unit, in which kinetic energy of
          progressive motion is converted into kinetic energy of rotary
          motion. This solution is characterized in that the pressure
          fluid chamber is made as an angle fluid splitter comprising an
          input cylinder co-operating with a piston of the ram and at
          least two output cylinders directed at an angle from an axis
          of the input cylinder, the said output cylinders co-operating
          with pistons whose rods are connected with the energy
          dissipating units driving spinning masses.<br>
          <br>
          In an advantageous solution axes of the output cylinders are
          deviated at an angle of 90° in relation to the axis of the
          input cylinder.<br>
          <br>
          In another advantageous solution the angle fluid splitter
          comprises three output cylinders, two outermost of which are
          deviated at an angle of 90° in relation to an axis of the
          input cylinder, and the middle output cylinder is situated
          along the axis of the input cylinder.<br>
          <br>
          In a further advantageous solution the angle fluid splitter
          comprises four output cylinders. Two outermost output
          cylinders are deviated at an angle of 90° from the axis of the
          input cylinder, and two longitudinal output cylinders are
          parallel to the axis of the input cylinder.<br>
          <br>
          In an advantageous solution the energy dissipating unit
          driving the spinning masses is made as a rack transmission in
          which a rack drives a spinning mass by means of a transmission
          increasing the rotational speed.<br>
          <br>
          By using the pressure fluid chamber made as an angle fluid
          splitter with its input cylinder co-operating with a piston of
          the ram, and with at least two output cylinders angularly
          deviated from the axis of the input cylinder, a greater
          collision energy dissipation is achieved, that means a greater
          part of a vehicle energy is taken over by the bumper.<br>
          <br>
          A particularly advantageous effect of a mutual elimination of
          collision forces is achieved when using the angle splitter in
          which axes of output cylinders are deviated at an angle of 90°
          in relation to the axis of the input cylinder.<br>
          <br>

          In the embodiment illustrated in FIG. 1 a ram 1 is connected
          with a piston 2 located in an input cylinder 3 of an angle
          fluid splitter 4 in the form of a three-way pipe creating a
          pressure fluid chamber 5. The angle fluid splitter 4 has
          moreover two output cylinders 6, 7 with their axes 8 deviated
          from an axis of the input cylinder 3 at an angle of 90°. A
          piston 9 connected to a push rod 10 is located in each of the
          output cylinders 6, 7, the said push rods 10 of each piston
          located in the output cylinders 6, 7 are coupled with an
          energy dissipating unit 11. The energy dissipating unit 11
          used in this embodiment during a collision changes kinetic
          energy of progressive motion into kinetic energy of rotary
          motion. The energy dissipating unit 11 consists of a rack 12
          co-operating with a gear 13 connected with a transmission 14
          increasing the rotation speed, the said transmission 14
          driving spinning masses 15 having a determined moment of
          inertia.<br>
          <br>
          Cooperating parts of the bumper are fastened inside the
          vehicle construction or inside the vehicle bumper in such a
          way that the ram 1 is located in an area of the greatest risk
          of a collision, and parts participating in energy taking over
          are located in an area protected against an excessive
          deformation. In the embodiment illustrated in FIG. 1 the
          bumper is fastened on a body plate 16, and bumper parts
          involved in energy takeover are fastened to said plate in such
          a way as to provide their proper co-operation during a
          collision. The angle fluid splitter 4, sliding guides 18 for
          the racks 12 and axles of the transmissions 14 increasing the
          rotation speed are fastened to the body plate 16.<br>
          <br>
          FIG. 2 shows a bumper comprising an angle fluid splitter in
          which the piston 2 of the ram 1 is located in the input
          cylinder 3, and three output cylinders 6, 7, 19 are arranged
          in equal angle intervals, whereas axes of two outermost output
          cylinders 6, 7 are deviated from an axis 20 of the input
          cylinder 3 at an angle of 90°, and a single middle output
          cylinder 19 is situated along the axis 20 of the input
          cylinder 3. While the device is acting, the pistons 9 sliding
          in the output cylinders 6, 7, 19 are driving the spinning
          masses 15 in the energy dissipating units 11.<br>
          <br>
          FIG. 3 shows a bumper comprising an angle fluid splitter with
          three output cylinders 6, 7, 19 while working as a result of a
          collision. While this device is working, the pistons 9 sliding
          in the output cylinders 6, 7, 19 drive the spinning masses 15
          in the energy dissipating units 11. The arrows near the moving
          elements show the direction of their shift or rotation.<br>
          <br>
          In another embodiment illustrated in FIG. 4 the angle fluid
          splitter has four output cylinders 6, 7, 21, 22. The two
          outermost output cylinders 6, 7 are deviated from the axis 20
          of the input cylinder 3 at an angle of 90°, and two
          longitudinal output cylinders 21, 22 are located on both sides
          of the axis 20 of the input cylinder 3 parallel to said axis.
          The spinning masses 15 of each of the said four energy
          dissipating units 11 are driven in the same way as in
          embodiments illustrated in FIGS. 1-3.<br>
          <br>
          According to the invention and as it is illustrated in FIG. 1
          collision energy received by the ram 1 of the bumper as
          kinetic energy of progressive motion is transmitted by a fluid
          shock absorber, made as a pressure fluid chamber 5, to the
          collision energy dissipating unit 11, in which kinetic energy
          of progressive motion is converted into kinetic energy of
          rotation motion by driving the spinning masses 15.<br>
          <br>
          Kinetic energy of progressive motion received by the ram 1 is
          divided in the pressure fluid chamber 5 of the fluid shock
          absorber into at least two directions. In the embodiments
          illustrated in FIG. 1-FIG. 4 collision energy by a thrust of a
          pressured agent inside the pressure fluid chamber is divided
          respectively into two, three and four directions. The fluid
          moving under the pressure is forced into the output cylinders
          in which moving pistons drive spinning masses. In the
          embodiments the spinning masses 15 are driven by means of a
          rack transmission coupled with the transmission 14 increasing
          the rotation speed.<br>
          <br>
          Each kind of a transmission may be used as the transmission 14
          increasing the rotation speed. Especially one may use belt
          transmissions, chain transmissions as well as all kinds of
          toothed transmissions.<br>
          <br>
          The strength of parts participating in receiving and
          transmitting collision energy is selected depending on a mass
          of a vehicle in which the bumper according to the invention is
          to be used and depending on a speed reached by that vehicle,
          thus depending on parameters characteristic for kinetic energy
          of progressive motion reached by that vehicle. In a case the
          bumper is used for protecting objects exposed to the impact of
          outer forces, strength parameters of bumper parts are selected
          based on the most probable values of energy received by the
          protected object.<br>
          <br>
          The cushion ability of the fluid splitter 4 is selected
          depending on the use of the bumper according to the invention.
          To achieve this aim, an inner space of the fluid splitter 4
          closed between its pistons is filled with fluid of suitable
          compressibility and being under a suitable initial pressure.
          When using a gas, the maximum protection of mechanical
          transmissions driving spinning masses against an impact load
          is achieved, whereas when using a liquid characterized by a
          low compressibility, an initial load of mechanical
          transmissions is greater, but at the same time the efficiency
          of converting kinetic energy of progressive motion into
          kinetic energy of rotation motion is better. A suitable
          compromise between minimizing the impact load of parts in
          mechanical transmissions and obtaining suitable effectiveness
          of energy conversion is achieved by filling the space inside
          the fluid splitter 4 with a liquid-gas mixture or with a
          suitably chosen material undergoing the plastic deformation,
          for example an elastomer.<br>
          <br>
          In order to obtain the correct bumper activity, the spinning
          masses 15 after achieving the maximum rotation speed during
          collision are disengaged from co-operation with driving
          elements transmitting energy to them<br>

              DEVICE FOR TRANSFORMING KINETIC ENERGY </b><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
        </center>
        <p align="left"><b>Abstract ---</b> The invention relates to a
          device for transforming kinetic energy, comprising a first
          body (2), which may be displaced from a starting position to
          an end position as a result of an external force (F) and at
          least one second body (7) mounted such as to rotate, coupled
          to the first body (2), whereby a longitudinal displacement of
          the first body (2) drives the second body (7) in rotation,
          such that the first body is braked. </p>
        <p align="left">Linear moving bodies such as vehicles, vessels,
          aircraft, boats, or the like have, in particular at high
          speeds on a high degree of kinetic energy, which is mostly
          converted in an impact on stationary objects into deformation
          energy.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">In vehicles, for example, selective deformation
          areas are provided in the front section of the vehicle to
          initiate an impact energy without damage to the passenger
          compartment in the chassis.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">However, the conversion of kinetic energy into
          deformation energy has the decisive disadvantage that the
          vehicle or the like is sustainably destroyed.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">Furthermore, there is at said deformation energy
          conversion in most cases is a disadvantage that it is only a
          limited deformation distance is available.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">For braking particular linearly moving bodies
          conventionally numerous devices are known, which are called
          Viskosebremse.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">A linear movement of the body is transferred to
          a rotating in a viscose pinion via a rack or the like.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">An increasing rotational speed of the pinion is
          reflected in a greater braking torque, whereby the body is
          slowed down accordingly.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">Such Viskosebremsen are known for example from
          DE 197 29 900 C1, DE 28 11 020, DE 296 21 043 or DE 295 18 173
          is known.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">However, these conventional Viskosebremsen
          subject to the disadvantage that they are only suitable for
          braking at low speeds.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">WO 03/005142 A1 describes an apparatus for
          controlling mechanical forces, in which the relative
          acceleration between two connection points is determined
          either by a flywheel gear or a differential piston mechanism.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">The invention is based on the object to provide
          a device for transforming kinetic energy, which is suitable
          with simple means for braking high linear velocities.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">This object is achieved by a device having the
          features of claim 1 and by an apparatus having the features of
          claim 19.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">Furthermore, the object is achieved by a system
          having the features of claim 31.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">Advantageous developments of the invention are
          defined in the dependent claims.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">An inventive device for transforming kinetic
          energy comprises a first body to a final position can be moved
          longitudinally in a row of an external force from a starting
          position, and at least a second body, which is mounted
          rotatably mounted on the device.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">The second body is coupled to the first body,
          wherein a longitudinal displacement of the first body leads to
          a rotation of the second body, so that the longitudinal
          movement of the first body is braked.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">The kinetic energy, which is associated with the
          movement of the first body is thus converted by means of said
          coupling advantageous in a rotational energy of the second
          body.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">In an advantageous embodiment of the invention,
          the coupling between the first body and the second body in a
          transmission ratio takes place.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">A longitudinal displacement of the first body
          thus leads to a relatively high rotational speed of the second
          body.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">According to the invention can be ratios of 1:50
          achieve, without causing damage to the bearings or the like in
          the apparatus.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">In an advantageous embodiment of the invention,
          the first body is connected to a rack member.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">The rack member is expediently, in mesh with a
          transmission gear, which may comprise a plurality of gear
          stages.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">The second body is driven by the reduction gear
          suitable excess.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">In an advantageous embodiment of the invention
          the second body is formed as a rod element which is mounted in
          rotation around its center.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">Thus rotate two approximately equal to long leg
          of the rod member to the rotational axis of the rod member.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">At the opposite ends of the rod member each mass
          body can be fixed, the increase in the offset rotary mass
          advantageous.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">To count the response of the rod element to
          facilitate from a standstill, a centrifugal weight can be
          provided, which is arranged longitudinally displaceable manner
          along the rod member.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">During a rotation of the rod member along the
          flyweight of the rod member is radially outward, that is,
          moved away from the axis of rotation.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">Thus arises with increasing speed of the rod
          elements or for further outward moving flyweight
          advantageously a greater moment of inertia of the rod element.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">Here, the centrifugal weight can advantageously
          be biased by a spring device in the direction of the rotation
          axis of the rod member, whereby the Fliehelement is held in a
          preset position.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">With increasing angular velocity of the rod
          member the flyweight against the spring force is outward, ie
          away down from the axis of rotation, which has an advantageous
          moment of inertia is reflected in the greater inertia.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">To avoid adverse imbalances or like two
          centrifugal can at the bar element on both sides of the axis
          of rotation to provide weights that longitudinal and explained
          along the rod member are slidably received.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">In an advantageous embodiment, the coupling
          between the first body and the second body by a strap means
          done.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">The strap means may be attached by means of a
          tangent cam on the second body.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">If a tensile force is applied to the strap means
          in consequence of the shift of the first body, the tangent cam
          and thus the second body is in a Rotation offset.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">Advantageously, the second body at the tangent
          cam is secured by means of a freewheel, so that the second
          body to an initial driving by the tangent cam further can
          rotate freely.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">In order to exert a tensile force upon movement
          of the first body to the strap means, a so-called finger
          device is fitted with finger members to the first body.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">In the initial position of the first body, the
          finger means is opposite to a recording block to which are
          complementary to the finger elements of the finger means web
          elements.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">The strap means extending between the finger
          means and the receiving block.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">If the first body enters into its final
          position, the finger elements engage with the web members and
          assume the strap means with.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">As a result, a tensile force is exerted on the
          tangent cam and thereby enables the second body to rotate
          about the strap means.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">For a particularly simple mounting of the strap
          means between the finger means and the receiving block on both
          sides of the receiving block two second bodies are arranged,
          wherein the strap means is stretched between the cams of the
          respective tangent second body.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">Thus, in one engaging-Get the finger means are
          synchronously displaced with the receiving block both second
          body through the strap means in rotation and braked the linear
          movement of the first body accordingly.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">In an advantageous embodiment of the invention,
          the rack member, which is connected to the first body in
          engagement with a gear on which another tangent cam is
          mounted.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">The strap means is properly tensioned between
          the two tangent cam, so that rotation of the gear wheel
          applies a tensile force as a result of longitudinal
          displacement of the rack member to the strap means and enables
          the second body to rotate.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">Such an embodiment, in which only a second body
          is driven by the belt means, characterized by smaller
          installation dimensions.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">The second body is advantageously designed as a
          flywheel, which supports converting the kinetic energy into
          rotational energy.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">In addition, brake elements can be provided
          which can be brought into contact with the centrifugal mass,
          so that the rotating flywheel can be braked by suitable
          pitching of braking elements on the flywheel.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">In an advantageous embodiment of the invention,
          the coupling between the first body and the second body is
          lifted at the end position of the first body.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">This results in that the second body is able to
          rotate after the conversion of kinetic energy into rotational
          energy more freely without a coupling to the first body
          restricts the rotation of the second body.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">In an advantageous embodiment of the invention,
          the coupling between the first body and the second body is
          subdued.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">This can be, for example, a gas compression
          spring means or the like reach, wherein the rack member having
          a free end which can serve as a piston rod which is slidably
          guided within a gas-filled container.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">For transforming kinetic energy of the other an
          inventive device is provided, comprising a body which can be
          moved longitudinally in a row of an external force, a filled
          with a fluid container and a body connected to the piston.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">The piston is guided displaceably inside the
          container between an initial position and a final position,
          wherein the container has a maximum fluid filling in the
          starting position of the piston.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">During a longitudinal displacement of the body,
          the fluid is displaced by the pistons and discharged from the
          container, so that the longitudinal movement of the body is
          suitably braked.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">In an advantageous embodiment of the invention,
          the container has at least one opening for discharging the
          fluid.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">To ensure a uniform discharge of the fluid from
          the container out, a plurality of openings practical, which
          may be mutually provided evenly spaced in the enclosure.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">A piston surface of the piston acting on the
          fluid, a gear ratio determined in relation to an opening cross
          section of the opening i.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">By analogy with a gear ratio of a mechanical
          gear determines the gear ratio i in the fluid solution, the
          extent to which the kinetic energy of linear motion of the
          body is transformed or braked.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">An essential aspect of the inventive device is
          that the energy transformation takes place via a so-called
          energy transferring mass in the fluid solution that is
          determined by dividing the mass of the device to the square of
          the product of the transmission ratio i.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">Accordingly, the energy transformation per
          length displacement of the piston takes place via a so-called
          energy-transmitting volume which is determined by dividing the
          energy transfer through the mass density of the fluid.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">It follows that the inventive energy
          transformation takes place exclusively on the mass of the
          body, wherein a speed of the device remains at a stationary
          obstacle out of consideration during an impact.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">In an advantageous embodiment of the invention
          is an end of the container, opposite the movable piston,
          substantially parallel to the piston surface, wherein the at
          least one opening formed in the container adjacent to the end
          face.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">In this way a uniform escape of fluid from the
          container at the maximum displacement of the fluid is ensured
          by the piston in the container.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">In particular for the transformation of very
          high kinetic energies, ie with very fast moving body, it is
          advantageous if the front side of the container, which is
          opposed to the movable piston having a wedge shape.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">Here, the opening in the container, from which
          the fluid in the sequence<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">Piston movement is removed, is formed as an
          annular gap extending between the wedge shape and a container
          wall.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">The wedge shape of the end face advantageously
          prevents leakage of turbulent flows of fluids and ensures a
          removal from the container with the desired damping
          ungswirkung.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">In the latter embodiment are certi- ficate to
          the inner surface of the containers in a plane in front of the
          wedge tip and orthogonal to the intended direction of movement
          of the piston stop elements that define the end position of
          the piston.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">If the piston is in its final position comes
          into contact with the stop elements, impingement of the piston
          at the wedge tip is not possible to give an adverse
          destruction of the wedge tip can be prevented.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">Wherein said fluid may be a gas, a liquid, or
          solid particles of microscopic dimensions.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">If the gas is placed inside the container under
          pressure, or alternatively, when using a liquid, the opening
          in the container is expediently closed by a diaphragm, a valve
          or the like to an output force of the pressurized gas or
          liquid To prevent the initial position of the piston.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">In a piston displacement and a corresponding
          displacement of the fluid in the container, the membrane, the
          valve, or the like is opened in order to ensure the said
          discharge of the fluid from the container out.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">In an advantageous embodiment of the invention,
          the device with the rotating body and the second device may be
          combined with the fluid container to one system, the
          respective devices are arranged in series and connected to
          each other.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">In this case, preferably a longitudinal
          displacement of the body due to the external force begins
          sequentially.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">Through such a series connection of individual
          devices can be advantageously a very large transmission ratio
          and thus an extremely high dissipation of kinetic energy to
          achieve.<br>

        <p align="left">In Fig. 1 a first embodiment of the inventive
          device is illustrated in principle simplified.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">The device comprises a base plate 1.<br>
        </p>

          arranged longitudinally displaceably with respect to the base
          plate 1.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">The cylinder 2 is filled with air 3, and closed
          at its open end by a piston rod 4, which has a rack 4a.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">On the piston rod 4 are provided sealing
          elements in the form of 0Ringen 4b which are in contact with
          an inner wall of the cylinder 2, and prevent leakage of air 3
          from the cylinder 2.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">On the base plate 1, a gear wheel segment 5 is
          rotatably mounted, which is attached thereto via a gear 6 with
          the rack gear 4a engage.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">Adjacent to the gear segment 6, a second body 7
          is rotatably mounted in the form of a flywheel.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">Another gear 8 is fixed to the flywheel 7 and
          meshes with the gear segment. 5<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">A translational displacement of the first body 2
          is realized by the gears 6,8 and the gear segment 5 in a
          rotation of the flywheel. 7<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">The device shown in Fig. 1 can be used
          advantageously in a vehicle shown in Fig. 7.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">The attachment of the device to the vehicle is
          carried out such that the base plate is fastened via fastening
          means 1a to the vehicle chassis, wherein the cylinder 2 is
          connected to a front bumper of the vehicle.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">Thus, a force acting in a frontal impact of the
          vehicle on the front bumper, passed down through the cylinder
          2 to the piston rod 4 and as explained converted into a
          rotation of the flywheel. 7<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">The gear stage consisting of the gears 6 and 8
          and the gear segment 5 is such that the meshing elements are
          separated from each other when the flywheel is 7 to rotate.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">Thus, another free rotation of the flywheel 7 is
          ensured if the linear impact energy is converted into
          rotational energy.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">With the apparatus shown in FIG. 1, ratios of up
          to 1:50 can be obtained.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">Thus, in a usable rack length of 20 cm, for
          example, occurs in the same flow power that would otherwise be
          achieved with a linear braking distance of 10 m.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">Overloading of the components is suitably
          achieved by the pneumatic damping, which is given by the
          air-filled cylinder 2 and 3, the piston rod 4.<br>

          flywheel driven by a translatory displacement in a further
          agreed simplified embodiment shown.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">The gear stage consists essentially of the rack
          4a, a meshing with the rack 4a gear 6 'which is hollow, and
          the flywheel 7 positioned within the gear 6' is arranged to
          rotate.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">The gear stage according to the embodiment of
          FIG. 1 is designed as a planetary gear, the gear ratio
          determined by the respective diameters of the gear 6 'and the
          flywheel 7 positioned within the gear 6' is provided with an
          internal toothing of the gear 6 'is engaged rotates and ,<br>

        <p align="left">The cross-sectional view of Fig. 1b shows the
          embodiment of FIG. 1a in a further development, in which the
          flywheel 7 can be braked by braking body 9.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">The brake body 9 are arranged on opposite sides
          of the flywheel 7 and can be by means of a press contact force
          respectively against the rotating flywheel 7 so that the
          rotational energy is converted into frictional heat.<br>

          the rod element 12 which are slidable along the rod member 12.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">The flyweights 14 may be designed as a solid
          ball having a through-hole whose inner diameter is suitably
          adapted to the outer diameter of the rod member 12 to provide
          a low-friction sliding along the rod member 12.<br>

        <p align="left">At the respective inertias so-called tangent cam
          21 are mounted, between which a strap means 22 is tensioned.<br>

          and a receiving block 24th<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">The finger means 23 is connected via a piston
          rod 4 with the first body 2, and the receiving block 24 is
          fixedly mounted to the base plate 1.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">The finger means 23 has a plurality of finger
          members 23a.<br>

        </p>
        <p align="left">The finger means 23 and the receiving block 24
          serve to exert a pulling force to the strap means 22, when the
          first body 2 is moved due to an external force F in the
          direction of the base plate. 1<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">In the case of a displacement of the finger

          finger members 23a enter into engagement with the web elements
          24a, wherein the strap means 22 is thereby stretched over the
          respective roller elements 25.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">As a result, the two tangent cam 21 and thus the
          centrifugal masses 20 are rotated.<br>

        <p align="left">Since the strap means in the tensioned initial
          state (shown in Fig. 3) initially represents a resistance for
          the moving in the direction of the receiving block 24 finger
          means 22, 23 allows the translational motion of the body 2 on
          which the finger means 23 is mounted, brake as desired ,<br>

        <p align="left">If a translational movement of the second body
          or the piston rod 4, the gear 30 is set in rotation, the strap
          means 34 is wound 31 tennocke on the tangent, wherein the
          strap means 34 applies a tensile force to the fixed to the

        <p align="left">For this purpose, the cylinder 40 is mounted by
          means of guiding devices 46 displaceable on the base plate. 1<br>

        </p>
        <p align="left">If the piston 42 reaches its end position in

        <p align="left">In contrast to the Fig. 5, the end face 47 'of
          the cylinder 40 is wedge-shaped in the embodiment of Fig. 6.<br>

          of the end face 49 'in particular for very high speeds and
          kinetic energies, because the conical shape of a discharge of
          the fluid from the cylinder 40 out is ensured by means of a
          substantially laminar flow, whereby disturbing turbulences be
          avoided.<br>

          without unity expressed in the acceleration of gravity, hence
          the term "gravitational load" results.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">The recorded measurement values ??are shown in
          the following figures 8 to 15 below.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">The changes in the physical parameters were
          determined in intervals of t = 100 ms.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">The time axis is such selected such that the
          time At = 0 attached to the test vehicle 70 displacement
          sensor or the measuring circuit 73 impinges on the obstacle
          75.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">Exactly at this time starts the recording of all
          measured variables.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">The test vehicle 70 moves at a constant speed up
          to the time t = 20 ms on.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">At this moment, the collision begins, ie, the
          bumper system 71 impinges on the obstacle 75.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">From this moment takes place between the bumper
          system 71 and the obstacle 75 takes no more relative movement,
          even though the test vehicle 70 still is in motion.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">The motion of the subject vehicle 70 with
          respect to the bumper system 71 instead activates the device
          72, so that thereby the kinetic energy of the test vehicle on
          the storage carousel, that is rotationally mounted to the
          second body of the device 72 is transferred.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">In the diagram of Fig. 8, the displacement
          distance of the measurement circuit 73 is plotted as a
          function of time.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">The diagram clearly shows that over a period of
          20 ms, ie, for a shift distance of x = 15 cm, the graph is
          linear and used in accordance with no delay.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">Only after t = 20 ms, if the measuring circuit
          has already 73 = shifted x 15 cm against the vehicle, reaches
          the bumper system 71 also. In contact with the obstacle 75,
          thereby activating the inventive apparatus 72<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">The following explanation refers to an example
          of the apparatus of FIG. 1,.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">Similarly, it may be in the apparatus 72,
          however, be a device shown in Figs. 5,5a and 6 after the fluid
          principle.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">By activating the device 72 20ms occurs from t =
          a displacement of the piston rod 4, so that the translational
          movement is converted into a rotation of the flywheel. 7<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">The distance by which the piston rod 4 is
          displaced in the direction of the base plate 1 is
          approximately 20 cm.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">Accordingly, the shift distance 8 such that
          after about 80 to 90 ms reached in Fig. 35 at x = a plateau
          value, the delay<br>
          is finished and the translational kinetic energy completely
          transformed into rotational energy or converted.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">The distance at which the vehicle brakes, ie,
          without activation of the device 72 collides with the obstacle
          75, can be slightly by the output pressure in the pneumatic
          spring (cylinder 2, air 3 and the piston rod 4 of Fig. 1) to
          adjust.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">In the diagram of Fig. 9, the speed of the
          subject vehicle 70 is plotted as a function of time, wherein
          the speed is measured by a hot-wire anemometer.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">The graph of Fig. 9 clearly shows that the
          vehicle speed (v = 7.2 m / s) up to the time in which the
          device 72 is activated (t = 20 ms), remains constant.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">Only when t&gt; 20 ms, that is, after activation
          of the device 72, the velocity of the vehicle from sliding
          scale such that the delay or the braking of the vehicle is
          finished after approximately 80 to 90 ms.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">In the diagram of Fig. 10, the acceleration is
          shown (in this case delay) serving as the derivation of the
          speed V (t) is defined according to time.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">In this acceleration is a kinematic size, which
          is denoted by a and is expressed without a unit, based on the
          gravitational acceleration (a / g).<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">The change in the acceleration as a function of
          time could be also based on the recorded track, as shown in
          Fig. 8, determined.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">The graph of Fig. 10 shows the negative
          acceleration (deceleration in this case), which would be
          subject to the vehicle 70, if it was not provided with the
          inventive device 72.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">In the said impact velocity of 7.2 m / s
          resulting values ??of up to 25 for the quotient a1 / g.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">In other words, this delay acting on an area of
          ??the bumper system 71, which is located in the direction of
          the obstacle 75 in front of the device 72nd<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">The Fig. 10 thus describes the deceleration of
          the vehicle 70 on the basis of an absolute reference system.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">In the diagram of Fig. 11, the changes in the
          gravitational load are shown, which are measured by an
          accelerometer 74.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">Under "gravitational load" is a dynamic variable
          to understand, which is expressed thus related items in the
          acceleration of gravity and referred to as (A2 / g).<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">The accelerometer 74 (FIG. 7) is disposed within
          a passenger compartment of the vehicle 70.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">Accordingly, measured starting from a relative
          reference system with the accelerometer 74 accelerations,
          which moves with the vehicle 70th<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">Up to the crash of the vehicle, or up to the
          time (t = 20 ms), in which the device 72 is activated, the
          accelerometer 74 (relatively considered) at rest and does not
          provide a measured value (a2 / g = 0).<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">Only from t = 20 ms learns the accelerometer 74,
          an acceleration, which is reflected by an increase of the
          graph in Fig. 11 to a value of +5.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">A comparison of the graphs of FIGS. 10 and 11
          shows very clearly the core of the present invention.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">During the acceleration quotient a1 / g
          increases (for a vehicle without the apparatus 72) according
          to a frontal impact, except for an amount of 25, the
          acceleration ratio a2 / g (for a vehicle having the inventive
          device 72) is five times lower than the quotient a1 / g.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">The ratio a2 / g decreases as shown in Fig. 11
          only a maximum amount of 5.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">A vehicle occupant, which is subjected to the
          same acceleration as the accelerometer 74, undergoes, thanks
          to the inventive device 72 has a five times as low
          acceleration, as when the vehicle is not provided with the
          device 72.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">The graph of Fig. 11 therefore represents the
          effect of the actually measured inertia force acting on a
          vehicle occupant in an impact on the standing obstacle 75.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">In the illustration of Fig. 12, the impact force

        <p align="left">An inertial force, which acts on a mass in a
          non-initial system of coordinates associated with a vehicle,
          is determined by the general equation:<br>
          B = -m * a (1) measured values ??of the acceleration shown in
          the graph of Fig. 10.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">A thus defined measured variable is called
          theoretical / predetermined inertial force, as it is
          determined on the basis of the measured accelerations.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">The configuration of the measuring system makes
          it possible to determine the inertial force of dynamic
          measurements with an accelerometer.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">Accordingly, it follows: Br = m * b (2) It is
          therefore certain inertial force is referred to as "real" as
          it is obtained directly from the force measurements.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">The inertial force acts opposite to the
          direction of the acceleration (or deceleration), so that in a
          1D<br>

          positive sign is take other.<br>

        <p align="left">As explained above, the impact force F is
          plotted as a function of time, when the subject vehicle 70
          strikes the obstacle 75 in the diagram of Fig. 12.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">In the here underlying coordinate system, the
          impact force also has a positive sign.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">In a reversal of the sign, the force F is to the
          force R exerted by the obstacle 75 on the test vehicle 70th<br>

          after a sign-reversal) that although these forces of opposite
          signs are approximately equal.<br>

        <p align="left">The experimental data shown in FIGS. 13 and 14
          shows that at the end of the collision process, when the test
          vehicle 70 has reached a speed of 0, the speed of the second
          body, that is, the flywheel, reaches a value of n = 18800
          min-1 , said an energy E = 24200 J is stored, which
          corresponds to 85% of the energy of the test vehicle prior to
          impact.<br>

        <p align="left">The braking process, which includes a
          translation of the kinetic energy in the flywheel storage,
          takes about 80 ms, although 30 ms after the beginning of the
          collision the vehicle<br>
          has already lost approximately 88% of its energy, which it had
          before the impact.<br>

          accelerometer (on the basis of values ??read out of a force
          sensor), ie the real forces of inertia are several hundred

        </p>
        <p align="left">With regard to possible applications of the
          inventive device, the problem of a varying impact force is
          considered in the following, which is generated during an
          impact of a vehicle with an obstacle.<br>

        <p align="left">The reduction in the inertial force must be
          accompanied by a reduction in the Impact force and vice versa.<br>

          with the pulse / moment principle.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">The momentum of the impact force, which is
          present in an impact of the test vehicle with the obstacle is
          equal to the change in the moment of inertia of the vehicle,
          which is reflected in the following equation:<br>
          &lt;img class = "EMIRef" id = "013638479-00270001" /&gt;<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">The equation (5) can be rewritten as:<br>
          &lt;img class = "EMIRef" id = "013638479-00270002" /&gt;<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">Before the crash is the moment of inertia of the
          test vehicle 70 p = 7.9 KNS, the moment of inertia after
          impact to zero.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">Accordingly, the first value to a change in the
          moment of inertia.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">The pulse which is determined from measurements
          of the temporal variations of the impact force during the
          collision, is p = 4 KNS. Therefore, the equation (5) is not
          satisfied.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">The pulse of the impact force is considerably
          smaller than the variation of the moment of inertia due to the
          effect of this force.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">If in the test vehicle 70, the inventive device
          72 is provided, this results in the change in the moment of
          inertia of the colliding vehicle, by the momentum of the
          reaction force acting on the vehicle, and by the dissipation
          of energy of the vehicle.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">In other words, causes a flow of energy during a
          collision of the vehicle, a deviation of the physical
          parameters of these processes by the said pulse / moment
          principle.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">The aforementioned measurement data, however,
          can determine not only with a device that has a mechanical
          rotary inertia, but shown in the same way by a in Figs. 5,5a

        <p align="left">Such fluid solutions are cheaper, quieter and
          more reliable than those with staggered momentum flywheel
          masses generally.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">In particular, can be achieved very high
          transmission ratios in comparison to the purely mechanical
          solutions.<br>

        <p align="left">The test rates found that the transformation or
          conversion of the kinetic energy of a moving object in other
          forms of energy pulses of the impact forces generated during a
          collision and the forces of inertia due to a deceleration in
          the collision reduce to a great extent at present experiments

          fivefold be found.<br>

        <p align="left">This is one indication of a deviation from the
          principle with respect to the inertial force and the
          acceleration and in the same way a departure from the pulse /
          torque principle.<br>

        <p align="left">In a conventional shock process, there are
          problems due to a very short time and a shock usually very

          absorbed or discharged.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">If the energy of a fast-moving vehicle can not
          be removed under controlled conditions, this leads to a
          destruction work which harms both the vehicle and the obstacle
          sustainably.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">Therefore, an essential requirement of the
          inventive device is that the time which is required for energy
          absorption is shorter than the time that occur within the
          irreversible bumps between the vehicle and an obstacle.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">Within this period, the total kinetic energy of
          the moving vehicle, or at least a substantial part of it
          should be absorbed, so that the kinetic energy of the vehicle
          even when the impact is substantially equal to zero.<br>
          The force for activation of the inventive device is necessary,
          should be as low as possible.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">Possible applications of the inventive device
          are: - protecting vehicles against collisions, - protection of
          ropeway installations (elevators, ropeways or the like)
          against failures due to cable breakage, - the mortar or the
          like in terms of absorption Recoil force - in the landing of
          aircraft on aircraft carriers to the To reduce braking
          distance.<br>

        <p align="left">The measurement data shown in the graphs of
          Figs. 17 and 18 with respect to the acceleration or the impact
          force clearly show that the stresses upon vehicle impact with
          use of the inventive device (curve 2) when compared to a
          vehicle without the device of the invention (curve 1 ) can
          significantly reduce.<br>

            TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
            <br>
          </b>The object of the present invention is an arrangement for
          protection of hydraulic actuators of underground shield from
          dynamic overload with a mechanical rotary absorber.<br>
          <b><br>
            BACKGROUND ART<br>
            <br>
          </b>Underground vehicles are prone to falling rocks from the
          top parts of the heading. In order to effectively protect the
          personnel or equipment moving by the underground vehicle, the
          vehicle should have a robust hood. The hoods are usually
          mounted on stiff arms or arms with hydraulic actuators.<br>
          <br>
          There are known powered underground shields protecting from
          fall of rock having a hood supported by means of a telescopic
          support on a base. Typical powered underground shields are
          disclosed in WO201 1/039693 or US7377727. These vehicles have
          telescopic supports configured to dampen the fall by hydraulic
          actuators, such as gas or oil dampers mounted within the
          supports. In order to effectively dampen the fall, the
          actuators must keep high efficiency. Keeping the efficiency
          and leakproofness of the actuators in the hard working
          conditions of the underground shields may cause problems.<br>
          <br>
          It would be advantageous to provide an alternative mechanism
          for protecting the actuators of the underground shield from
          dynamic load.<br>
          <br>
          WO2004028864 discloses a rotor device for taking over and
          dissipating impact energy, in which kinetic energy suddenly
          created by a collision is converted into kinetic energy of
          rotating masses. In this known solution a ram element is
          connected with two racks which drive by means of gears the
          rotors shaped as rods with movable weights sliding on them.
          Minimizing of percussive load of cooperating elements in the
          preliminary phase of the energy transfer is realized in the
          known solution by using movable weights situated possibly near
          a rotation axis of a bar-rotor so as to achieve a minimum
          moment of inertia of the rotor in this initial phase. In the
          further stage of this motion, when the rotor begins its
          rotation, these weights are moved by the centrifugal force
          increasing their distance from the rotation axis along the bar
          axis till reaching the extreme position near the end limiters.
          In this position the highest moment of inertia of the rotor is
          achieved, enabling the takeover of increased kinetic energy.<br>
          <b><br>
          </b>A rotor device for taking over and dissipating kinetic
          impact energy is also known from patent application
          WO2005121593, said device comprising a ram element cooperating
          with a rack making, by means of a toothed wheel, a kinetic
          energy rotary accumulator to rotate in order to convert impact
          energy into kinetic energy of rotary motion of the rotary
          accumulator. In one of embodiments of the known rotor device
          for taking over an impact energy a kinetic energy rotary
          accumulator cooperates with movable weights maintained in a
          suitable distance from a rotation axis by means of springs.
          Such a solution provides gradual increment of the ability of
          the device to take over kinetic energy during an impact.<br>

          WO2004053352 discloses a device for absorbing kinetic energy,
          comprising a rotor coupled with a bumper via a multiplying
          gear.<br>
          <br>
          DE3141024 discloses a device for converting energy generated
          by an oscillating mass to an energy for driving a rotatable
          element by means of a rotatable shaft coupled with a hydraulic
          system.<br>
          <br>
          The solutions described above do not provide efficient
          conversion of energy for various impact speeds and various
          masses of the impacting objects.<br>
          <br>
          PCT/PL201 1/050060 (known to the inventors and not published
          before the priority date of the present application) discloses
          a rotary device for absorbing and dissipating energy of
          impact, used to convert kinetic energy of translational
          movement to kinetic energy of rotational movement. A ram
          element cooperates with at least two serially connected racks
          slidably mounted on a runner and driving the toothed wheels of
          the kinetic energy rotary accumulators. Distances are created
          between the ram element and the first rack and moreover
          distances are created between the racks to ensure the action
          of cushioning elements and to enable shifting of the ram
          element in relation to the racks, as well as shifting of these
          racks in relation to one another.<br>
          <br>
          The invention presented in PCT/PL201 1/050060 is new and
          inventive over the solutions described before, as it allows
          gradual damping with increasing efficiency of energy
          dissipation in relation to the speed and mass of the objects
          under impact. By providing cushioning elements between the
          rotary absorbers, the load can be transferred gradually to
          successive absorbers and the moment of inertia can be
          gradually increased, thereby gradually adapting to the energy
          of impact. Such solution was neither known nor suggested by
          any of the previous publications.<br>
          <br>
          The object of the invention is a new use of the rotary device
          for absorbing and dissipating energy of impact known from
          PCT/PL201 1/050060, in particular the use for absorbing
          impacts imparted to hydraulic actuators of an underground
          shield.<br>

          <b>DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
            <br>
          </b>The object of the invention is a protective arrangement
          for hydraulic actuators of an underground shield from dynamic
          overload with a mechanical rotary absorber, characterized in
          that it comprises a hydraulic actuator mountable to the base
          of the underground shield, to which there is connected a
          rotary device for taking over and dissipating the energy of
          rocks falling on the hood, wherein the device for taking over
          and dissipating energy comprises a ram element mounted to the
          actuator, slidably coupled by means of ram guides with side
          walls of a base plate mountable to the hood, which cooperates
          with at least two serially connected racks mounted slidably on
          a runner and driving toothed wheels of the kinetic energy
          rotary accumulators, wherein distances are created between the
          ram element and the first rack, as well as between the
          particular racks, said distances enabling the displacement of
          the ram element in relation to racks, as well as the
          displacement of these racks in relation to one another, such
          as to enable the moving ram element to pass the kinetic energy
          of the translational movement to the kinetic energy rotary
          accumulators in order to transform it to the kinetic energy of
          rotational movement.<br>
          <br>
          Preferably, the kinetic energy rotary accumulators have
          different energy accumulating abilities.<br>
          <br>
          Preferably, the kinetic energy rotary accumulators have
          different moments of inertia.<br>
          <br>
          Preferably, the kinetic energy rotary accumulator driven by
          the first rack has a smaller moment of inertia than the
          kinetic energy rotary accumulator driven by the second rack.<br>
          <br>
          Preferably, the kinetic energy rotary accumulators are driven
          by transmissions increasing angular speed, which have
          different transmission ratios.<br>
          <br>
          Preferably, the kinetic energy rotary accumulator has a
          one-way clutch. The protective arrangement according to the
          invention comprises a device for absorbing and dissipating
          energy of impact, wherein as a result of serial connection of
          the ram element with at least two serially connected racks
          which drive toothed wheels of kinetic energy rotary
          accumulators, with distances provided between the said racks,
          it is assured gradual driving in rotation of the subsequent
          kinetic energy rotary accumulators, what enables an abrupt
          increase of energy taking over ability of the device according
          to the invention. Cushioning elements fastened in the front of
          the racks in series decrease the percussive load of elements
          cooperating when starting the subsequent kinetic energy
          accumulators. The device according to the invention is
          suitable both for taking over small as well as great impact
          energy. In the first case the device ensures the effective and
          very gentle takeover of the impact energy because kinetic
          energy of progressive motion is carried out by kinetic energy
          rotary accumulators having the least moment of inertia. In the
          second case the device according to the invention provides
          also effective and uniform dissipation of the impact energy
          because taking over of kinetic energy of progressive motion is
          carried out by several kinetic energy rotary accumulators
          having ever greater energy taking over ability.<br>
          <br>
          In a case of collisions of greater energy, in the device
          according to the invention there appears also an additional
          beneficial effect consisting in that kinetic impact energy,
          before being taken over by the kinetic energy rotary
          accumulators having the greater moment of inertia, is
          accumulated in its substantial part by kinetic energy rotary
          accumulators having the smaller moment of inertia. Such an
          order of taking over the energy provides the gentler operation
          of the device according to the invention during starting of
          next kinetic energy rotary accumulators, even those having the
          greatest moment of inertia.<br>
          <br>
          By using a one-way clutch, the free rotation of the kinetic
          energy rotary accumulator is provided after taking over the
          impact energy until the energy accumulated in it is
          dissipated.<br>
          <br>
          Therefore, it is possible to absorb impacts on the hood from
          rocks of different masses, falling from different heights.
          This allows to make the hood 101 from lighter materials than
          in case of hoods that are not so effectively dampened.<br>

            CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
          </b><br>
          Fig. 1 shows schematically an embodiment of an underground
          shield with a hood 101 protected by hydraulic actuators,
          wherein protective arrangements, shown in details in Fig. 2,
          are used. The hood 101 is supported on the base 102 of the
          vehicle by means of hydraulic actuators 103, at the ends of
          which there is mounted a rotary device 1 10 for taking over
          and dissipating energy of impact of rocks to the hood 101 ,
          described in details with reference to Figs. 3-8. The ram
          element 1 of the device 1 10 is mounted to the actuator 103
          and the base plate 13 is mounted to the hood 101 .<br>
          <br>
          As shown in the embodiment of Fig. 3, the rotor device for
          taking over and dissipating impact energy has a ram element 1
          made as a beam and coupled with three racks 2, 3, 4 connected
          in series. Between the racks 2, 3, 4, as well as between the
          ram element 1 and the first rack 2 distances 5, 6, 7 are
          formed which enable an action of cushioning elements 8 and
          cause that the racks 2, 3, 4 shift in relation to one another,
          as well as in relation to the ram element 1 . Each of the
          racks 2, 3, 4 meshes with a toothed wheel 9 driving a kinetic
          energy rotary accumulator 10, 1 1 , 12, whereas in order to
          achieve greater effectiveness of impact energy receiving and
          dissipating, the first kinetic energy rotary accumulator 10
          driven by the first rack 2 has the least inertia moment, the
          second kinetic energy rotary accumulator 1 1 driven by the
          second rack 3 has an average inertia moment, and the third
          kinetic energy rotary accumulator 12 driven by the third rack
          4 has the greatest inertia moment.<br>
          <br>
          The ram element 1 is slidably engaged with side walls of a
          body plate 13 by means of ram runners 14, whereas these ram
          runners 14 are fastened perpendicularly to the ram element 1 .
          Moreover, a runner 15 is fastened to the body plate 13, said
          guide ensuring shifting of the racks 2, 3, 4 in a suitable
          distance from the toothed wheels 9.<br>
          <br>
          As it is shown in Fig. 4, the cushioning elements 8 are
          located in cylindrical openings 16 made in the racks 2, 3, 4.
          These openings cooperate with pressing mandrels 17 carrying
          impact energy from the ram element 1 onto the consecutive
          racks 2, 3, 4. In embodiments illustrated in the figure the
          cushioning elements 8 have a form of helical springs, however
          this solution does not limit the possibility of using other
          cushioning elements such as, in particular, fluid or elastomer
          absorbers.<br>
          <br>
          As it is schematically shown in the cross section in Fig. 5,
          in an opening 18 formed in the body plate 13 there is an axle
          19 tightly fastened, with the rotatably mounted toothed wheel
          9 combined with an internal bush 20 of the kinetic energy
          rotary accumulator 12. The kinetic energy rotary accumulator
          12 has furthermore a one-way clutch 21 of the known
          construction situated in the annular space around the internal
          bush 20.<br>
          <br>
          In the second embodiment of the device according to the
          invention presented in Fig. 6, there are used the kinetic
          energy rotary accumulators 10, 1 1 , 12 having different
          moments of inertia and rack transmissions having different
          transmission ratios as the result of different pitch diameters
          of the used toothed wheels 9a, 9b, 9c. The kinetic energy
          rotary accumulator 10 having the least moment of inertia is
          driven by means of the toothed wheel 9a having the greatest
          pitch diameter, and the kinetic energy rotary accumulator 12
          having the greatest moment of inertia is driven by means of
          the toothed wheel 9c having the least pitch diameter. This
          construction according to the invention makes it possible to
          obtain increased progressiveness of taking over the impact
          energy by successively started kinetic energy rotary
          accumulators. The characteristic of the progressiveness of
          taking over the impact energy by the consecutive kinetic
          energy rotary accumulators 10, 1 1 , 12 in the embodiment
          shown in Fig. 6 can be therefore shaped across by selecting
          pitch diameters of the driving toothed wheels 9a, 9b, 9c and
          by selecting moments of inertia of the consecutive kinetic
          energy rotary accumulators 10, 1 1 , 12.<br>
          <br>
          The arrow which is perpendicular to the external surface of
          the ram element drawn in Fig. 3, Fig. 4 and Fig. 6 shows the
          expected direction of an impact load. Every angular deflection
          of the impact load from the expected direction increases the
          probability of the damage of the device and causes the
          reduction of the efficiency of taking over and dispersing
          impact energy. Therefore, the device according to the
          invention should be mounted in objects exposed to results of
          the unexpected collision in such a way that the expected
          impact load is substantially perpendicular to the external
          surface of the ram element 1 .<br>
          <br>
          In the embodiment shown in Fig. 6 the ram element 1 is
          connected slidably with the body plate 13 by means of ram
          runners 14a which are mounted slidably in openings 22 made in
          the body plate 13 parallel to the runner 15 of the racks 2, 3,
          4. Such a solution provides the increased shape rigidity of
          the whole device and can be used also in case of larger
          angular deviations of the impact load from the direction
          perpendicular to the external surface of the ram element 1 .<br>
          <br>
          As it is shown in Fig. 7, one-way clutch 21 of the known
          construction is situated between the inner bush 20 and an
          inner surface of the kinetic energy rotary accumulator 1 1 .<br>
          <br>
          The one-way clutch 21 is used to transmit the torque from the
          internal bush 20 to the kinetic energy rotary accumulator 10,
          1 1 , 12. After taking over the impact energy, when the
          angular speed of the internal bush 20 is smaller than the
          angular speed of the suitable kinetic energy rotary
          accumulator 10, 1 1 , 12, the one-way clutch 21 is
          disconnected to enable free rotation of the kinetic energy
          rotary accumulator 10, 1 1 , 12.<br>
          <br>
          Thanks to enabling the free rotation of the kinetic energy
          rotary accumulators 10, 1 1 , 12 the kinetic energy stored in
          a short time of an impact can be dissipated in a significantly
          longer time.<br>
          <br>
          In Fig. 8 the device according to the invention is shown
          during taking over the impact energy. Sliding linear motions
          and rotary motions of particular parts of the device
          respectively are shown in this figure with arrow lines. To
          enable taking over of the impact energy by the device
          according to the invention, the body plate 13 is fastened to
          the hood 101 (not shown in the drawing) by fastening elements
          23. Depending on energy taking over capacity of the device
          according to the invention, fastening elements 23 can be
          realized by welding, riveting, gluing, screwing and any other
          possible connections which can be used in a construction of an
          object protected against results of a collision.<br>
          <br>
          The energy acting during the impact on the ram element 1 ,
          transferred by racks 2, 3, 4 to the kinetic energy rotary
          accumulators 10, 1 1 , 12, is initially absorbed by the
          cushioning elements 8. Because of a serial connection of racks
          2, 3, 4, the kinetic energy rotary accumulators 10, 1 1 , 12
          begin their work one after another starting from the kinetic
          energy rotary accumulator 10 having the least moment of
          inertia, and finishing with the kinetic energy rotary
          accumulator 12 having the greatest moment of inertia. In the
          solution according to the invention the maximum idle stroke of
          the ram element 1 in relation to the last rack 4 which drives
          the kinetic energy rotary accumulator 12 having the greatest
          moment of inertia is equal to the sum of distances 5, 6, 7
          between the ram element 1 and the first rack 2, as well as
          among particular racks 2, 3, 4.<br>
          <br>
          In the device according to the invention, in the working
          position illustrated in Fig. 8 during taking over of the
          impact energy, the distances 5, 6, 7 existing in the rest
          state are decreased to the size 5a, 6a, 7a. At such position
          of the racks 2, 3, 4 all of the kinetic energy rotary
          accumulators 10, 1 1 , 12 are driven, whereas in this position
          the kinetic energy accumulator 10 having the least moment of
          inertia has the greatest angular speed, the kinetic energy
          accumulator 1 1 having the average moment of inertia has the
          average angular speed, and the kinetic energy accumulator 12
          having the greatest moment of inertia has the least angular
          speed.<br>
          <br>
          In case of taking over greater impact energies by the rotor
          device according to the invention, the distances 5a, 6a, 7a
          can reach the zero value and in this case linear speeds of the
          moving racks 2, 3, 4 are equal, and at equal ratios of the
          rack transmissions, the angle velocities of the kinetic energy
          rotary accumulators 10, 1 1 , 12 are also equal.<br>

          The method of vehicle protection against a crash and/or sudden
          braking and/or vibrations caused by road unevenness and/or
          other bodies with high kinetic energy such as stones or
          bullets impacting on the vehicle consists in that suddenly
          produced kinetic energy is immediately converted and stored in
          an energetic accumulating converter (6), in particular, the
          kinetic energy produced by a force acting on the vehicle's
          bumper is converted into rotational energy, which set
          impeller(s) in motion. The device as above includes a system,
          which converts straight-line motion energy into rotational
          energy.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;The method of vehicle protection against a crash and/or
          sudden braking and/or vibrations caused by road unevenness
          and/or other bodies with high kinetic energy such as stones or
          bullets impacting on the vehicle<br>
          This invention set forth the method of vehicle protection
          against a crash and/or sudden braking and/of vibrations caused
          by road unevenness and/or other bodies with high kinetic
          energy such as stones or bullets impacting on the vehicle and
          the related device.<br>
          <br>
          According to the solutions known, vehicles are protected by
          means of elements absorbing energy, which is produced during a
          crash in large quantities in very short time intervals
          measured in milliseconds. Usually, such elements include
          bumpers with a variety of constructions that absorb crash
          energy, however a very small portion of that produced. As a
          result, the whole vehicle is subject to deformation until it
          is crushed and huge force (inertia, overloads) that act on
          passengers and luggage make them move and even throw them away
          from the vehicle. So, passengers are subject to not only
          bodily injury caused by the car body being crushed but also by
          the car components such as engine, gear box and steering
          system that move inwards the body.<br>
          <br>
          In order to counteract these ufavourable effect,s in some
          vehicles shock absorbers have been used in classic bumper
          constructions specific to solutions that damp sudden forces.<br>
          <br>
          However, the results obtained have been unsatisfactory.<br>
          <br>
          The proposed method allows the above described dangers to be
          avoided or limited to a great extent.<br>
          <br>
          The method under consideration consists in that suddenly
          produced kinetic energy is immediately converted and stored in
          an accumulating converter.<br>
          <br>
          In particular, the kinetic energy produced by the force acting
          on the vehicle's bumper is converted into rotational energy
          which set impellers) in motion.<br>
          <br>
          The device invented has a bumper and energy absorbing system,
          which converts straight-line motion energy into rotational
          energy.<br>
          <br>
          The first implementation option of the system, which converts
          straight-line motion energy into rotational energy, includes a
          guide mating with the bumper and equipped with a toothed bar.
          The guide is connected with a toothed wheel of a gear and the
          toothed bar has, on a part of its circumference, a toothed
          wheel mating with a disc with a rack, which is significantly
          lower in diameter than the part of circumference. (see Figure
          1).<br>
          <br>
          The second implementation option includes a converter mating
          with the bumper. The converter consists of a block with
          U-shaped cutting,s another similar block also with U- shaped
          cuttings with different width that are displaced against the
          cuttings of the first Mock, rollers located at the ends of
          protrusions formed by cuttings, and a string spanning the two
          blocks and wound on accumulating discs.<br>
          <br>
          The device invented is shown as some implementation examples
          on the following <br>

          The device shown in Figure 1 has a guide equipped with a
          toothed bar. The toothed bar mates with a pinion of a gear
          with a large toothed wheel on a part of its circumference,
          whereas the latter Slates with a pinion of rotary disc, which
          forms a kinetic energy accumulator. Upon impact on the bumper
          the pinion of the gear is set in motion thereby actuating the
          large toothed wheel of the gear on a part of its
          circumference. At the same time, the pinion of the rotary
          accumulating disc is set in motion to take energy from the
          bumper. The pinion will immediately be disconnected after it
          has mated with the large toothed wheel of the gear on a part
          of its circumference.<br>
          <br>
          Figure 2 presents the second implementation option of the
          invention. Upon action of a force on the bumper, the
          protrusions of one block ended with rollers move and come into
          the cuttings of the other Mock. At the same time, the string
          is deformed from a straight-line form into a wave form, so the
          string is pulled out from the accumulating discs thereby
          setting them in rotation result iii the transfer of the
          bumper's energy to the accumulating discs and its its
          conversion into energy needed to rotate the discs. So
          straight-line motion energy is converted into rotational
          energy. The harmful bumper's energy acting along a saint line
          is neutralised.<br>
          <br>
          Figure 3 presents another implementation option.<br>
          <br>
          As previously mentioned, the invention allows a motor vehicle
          to be protected by means of energetic bumper, energetic brake,
          energetic vibration dampers and energetic armour against a
          crash and/of sudden braking and/or vibrations caused by
          unevenness and/or other bodies with high kinetic energy such
          as stones or bullets impacting on the vehicle and energy to be
          accumulated. It will be the vehicle's energy in the event of
          crashing into an obstacle, the total energy of two vehicles in
          the event of two vehicles crashing into each other (if the
          other vehicle has no device according to the invention
          installed), the energy of stone/bullet in the event of its
          impact, the vehicle's energy in the event of braking and
          finally, the vehicle's mechanical vibraiton energy in the
          event of vibrations.<br>
          <br>
          The Energy Converter and Accumulator (ECA) takes the kinetic
          energy from a vehicle when crashing or braking ad converts it
          into the kinetic energy of a rotary element (mechanical
          accumulator). The rotary element is a component of the ECA and
          accumulates a significant part or almost the whole energy of a
          vehicle in motion. The ECA must convert energy within such a
          time interval that is shorter than that causing irreversible
          crash effects, i. e. shall be measured in milliseconds. The
          ECA accumulates the vehicle's kinetic energy in an impeller
          whose mass is as little as about one per cent (10/o) of the
          vehicle ! s mass. Such a high kinetic energy is accumulated by
          the ECA m such a small mass by rotating the impeller at very
          high speed amounting to tenths of nds rpm or even more. The
          vehcile's energy flows to the ECA through mechanical
          transmissions : gear., string ones, magnetic or hybrid
          transmissions with fixed or variable transmission ratios.
          Energy is accumulated in the form of rotational energy of
          impellers with a fixed or variable moment of inertia during
          the process.<br>
          <br>
          The ECA operation, and thereby the protection method, is based
          on the energy conservation law. The vehicle in motion, from
          which energy is taken, transferred and converted into the
          energy of a different object (in this case ECA) becomes safe.<br>
          <br>
          The energy of any object being in rotary motion is determined
          by the following formulae: Ekrm=I0#02 where: Ekm = kinetic
          energy being in rotary motion of the object whose energy is to
          be absorbed, I0-the object's moment of inertia, @0-the objects
          angular velocity.<br>
          <br>
          The energy of any object being in translatory motion is
          determined by the following formulae : E = m0V02 where : Ektm
          = kinetic energy int ranslatory motion of the object whose
          energy is to be absorbed, mo-the object's mass, Vo-the
          object's linear velocity.<br>
          <br>
          The kinetic energy of the ECA's accumulator being in rotary
          motion is determined by the following formulae : Ekrma=Ia#a2
          where : Ekm = =kinetic energy of the accumulator absorbing and
          accumulating the object's energy,<br>
          Ia - the accumulator's moment of inertia, #a - the
          accumulator's angular velocity.<br>
          <br>
          Any vehicle will be protected effectively against any crash
          effects when the ECA takes as much as possible kinetic energy
          of the vehicle in motion (boejct) and accumulates it as
          rotational energy, i.e. Ekrma as determined by formulae (3) is
          close to the objects energy as determined by formula (2) or
          (1). The time limits as mentioned above must be observed in
          the process of energy flow from the object to the ECA.<br>
          <br>
          Figure 1 presents the first implementation option of the ECA
          device, which converts translatory motion energy of a moving
          object into rotatioaai energy-The system consists of base 1
          immovaly fixed to the protected vehicle, element, movable
          against the base, taking impact force and transferring energy
          2, flexible element 3 attached to the movable element 2, gear
          4 converting translatory motion into rotary motion,
          multiplying gear 5, which transfers kinetic energy to energy
          accumulator 6 Once a force has acted on element (2) and energy
          flowed to accumulator 6, both gears 5 and 6 will disconnect
          thus enabling the accumulator to store for a longer time the
          energy taken. The ECA system shown in Figure 1 is designed as
          a twin version, i.e. there are two symmetrically located gears
          and accumulators.<br>
          <br>
          Figure 2 presents the other implementation option of the ECA
          system, which consists of base 1 immovably fixed to the
          protected vehicle, fixed part 22 of the string transmission<br>
          <br>
          connected immovably with the base, movable part 23 of the
          string transmission, rollers 24 guiding the string in both the
          fixed and movable part, string 25, parts on which the string
          is wound 26 (the cross section of elements can be a circle,
          scroll, cam to enable torque's arm to be changed), energy
          accumulators 27, element to take impact force and transfer
          energy 28, connected immovably with the movable part of the
          roller trnasmission. Upon crash, the movable part of the
          roller transmission slides along the guides into the fixed
          part and tightens the string guided by the rollers. The
          tightened string is unwound from part 26 and sets the
          accumulators in rotation as parts 26 are immovably connected
          with the accumulators. By setting the energy accumulators in
          rotation they take and accumulate energy of the protected
          vehicle. This ECA design option of the system consists of one
          string transmission, which transfers energy to two energy
          accumulators.<br>
          <br>
          Figure 3 shows another implementation option of the invention.
          Here, the ECA device consists of base @ 1 immovably fixed to
          the protected vehicle, part taking force and transferring
          crash energy 32, toothed bar 33, toothed gear 34 to convert
          translatory motion into rotation, mechanical accumulators 35
          to take and store the vehicle's kinetic energy to be converted
          into rotational energy. Set into rotation, the energy
          accumulators are immovably connected with the toothed wheels
          of gear 34 The accumulators have movable parts 36, which after
          actuating an accumulator move outwards of the rotation axis
          due to centrifugal force thus increasing the accumulator's
          moment of inertia. It is easier to start up the accumulator
          with variable moment of inertia as it starts to move at a
          lower moment of inertia. The ECA system shown in Figure 3 is a
          twin version including two gears and two accumulators. In case
          of a crash, energy is trnasferred to the gears and then
          converted into kinetic rotational energy. which is stored in
          the accumulator. Once part 32 has been moved due to a crash
          and the related energy transferred to the accumulator by gear
          34 the gear is disconnected.<br>
          <br>
          Thanks to the invention, in addition to the vehicle's
          protection, inertia forces acting on masses in the vehicle
          (people, luggage) are reduced. Such reduction may exceed 90%
          as compared with those ose values when the invention is not
          used.<br>
          <br>
          The invention can replace the action of bumpers, crumple
          zones, shields and armours with separate devices, with
          different performance and accumulated energy, to be used for
          each of the above mentioned tasks-<br>
          <br>
          Use of energy conversion and accumualtion to repalce crumple
          zones, friction brakes, shock absorbers, stiff shields and
          armours.<br>
          <br>
          It should be stressed that the invention can be used to
          eliminate inertia forces, i.e. when braking aeroplanes at
          short runways such as on aircraft carriers, touching an
          aeroplane with the ground (absorbing inertia forces), as well
          as, to brake ships or generally speaking - to liquidate
          inertia forces acting on any object by converting the object's
          kinetic energy into the kinetic energy of devices purposely
          built according to this invention.<br>
          <br>
          The use of the ECA system as an energetic brake is similar to
          that as a bumper but much simpler, since there is no need to
          convert translatory motion into rotation.<br>

          </b><b>TECHNICAL FIELD</b><br>
          <br>
          The object of the present invention is an arrangement for
          protection of hydraulic actuators of underground shield from
          dynamic overload with a mechanical rotary absorber.<br>
          <br>
          <b>BACKGROUND ART</b><br>
          <br>
          Underground vehicles are prone to falling rocks from the top
          parts of the heading. In order to effectively protect the
          personnel or equipment moving by the underground vehicle, the
          vehicle should have a robust hood. The hoods are usually
          mounted on stiff arms or arms with hydraulic actuators.<br>
          <br>
          There are known powered underground shields protecting from
          fall of rock having a hood supported by means of a telescopic
          support on a base. Typical powered underground shields are
          disclosed in <b>WO201 1/039693</b> or <b>US7377727.</b>
          These vehicles have telescopic supports configured to dampen
          the fall by hydraulic actuators, such as gas or oil dampers
          mounted within the supports. In order to effectively dampen
          the fall, the actuators must keep high efficiency. Keeping the
          efficiency and leakproofness of the actuators in the hard
          working conditions of the underground shields may cause
          problems.<br>
          <br>
          It would be advantageous to provide an alternative mechanism
          for protecting the actuators of the underground shield from
          dynamic load.<br>
          <br>
          <b>WO2004028864</b> discloses a rotor device for taking over
          and dissipating impact energy, in which kinetic energy
          suddenly created by a collision is converted into kinetic
          energy of rotating masses. In this known solution a ram
          element is connected with two racks which drive by means of
          gears the rotors shaped as rods with movable weights sliding
          on them. Minimizing of percussive load of cooperating elements
          in the preliminary phase of the energy transfer is realized in
          the known solution by using movable weights situated possibly
          near a rotation axis of a bar-rotor so as to achieve a minimum
          moment of inertia of the rotor in this initial phase. In the
          further stage of this motion, when the rotor begins its
          rotation, these weights are moved by the centrifugal force
          increasing their distance from the rotation axis along the bar
          axis till reaching the extreme position near the end limiters.
          In this position the highest moment of inertia of the rotor is
          achieved, enabling the takeover of increased kinetic energy.<br>
          <br>
          A rotor device for taking over and dissipating kinetic impact
          energy is also known from patent application <b>WO2005121593</b>,
          said device comprising a ram element cooperating with a rack
          making, by means of a toothed wheel, a kinetic energy rotary
          accumulator to rotate in order to convert impact energy into
          kinetic energy of rotary motion of the rotary accumulator. In
          one of embodiments of the known rotor device for taking over
          an impact energy a kinetic energy rotary accumulator
          cooperates with movable weights maintained in a suitable
          distance from a rotation axis by means of springs. Such a
          solution provides gradual increment of the ability of the
          device to take over kinetic energy during an impact.<br>
          <br>
          <b>WO2004053352</b> discloses a device for absorbing kinetic
          energy, comprising a rotor coupled with a bumper via a
          multiplying gear.<br>
          <br>
          <b>DE3141024</b> discloses a device for converting energy
          generated by an oscillating mass to an energy for driving a

          hydraulic system.<br>
          <br>
          The solutions described above do not provide efficient
          conversion of energy for various impact speeds and various
          masses of the impacting objects.<br>
          <br>
          PCT/PL201 1/050060 (known to the inventors and not published
          before the priority date of the present application) discloses
          a rotary device for absorbing and dissipating energy of
          impact, used to convert kinetic energy of translational
          movement to kinetic energy of rotational movement. A ram
          element cooperates with at least two serially connected racks
          slidably mounted on a runner and driving the toothed wheels of
          the kinetic energy rotary accumulators. Distances are created
          between the ram element and the first rack and moreover
          distances are created between the racks to ensure the action
          of cushioning elements and to enable shifting of the ram
          element in relation to the racks, as well as shifting of these
          racks in relation to one another.<br>
          <br>
          The invention presented in PCT/PL201 1/050060 is new and
          inventive over the solutions described before, as it allows
          gradual damping with increasing efficiency of energy
          dissipation in relation to the speed and mass of the objects
          under impact. By providing cushioning elements between the
          rotary absorbers, the load can be transferred gradually to
          successive absorbers and the moment of inertia can be
          gradually increased, thereby gradually adapting to the energy
          of impact. Such solution was neither known nor suggested by
          any of the previous publications.<br>
          <br>
          The object of the invention is a new use of the rotary device
          for absorbing and dissipating energy of impact known from
          PCT/PL201 1/050060, in particular the use for absorbing
          impacts imparted to hydraulic actuators of an underground
          shield.<br>

          <b>DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
          <br>
          The object of the invention is a protective arrangement for
          hydraulic actuators of an underground shield from dynamic
          overload with a mechanical rotary absorber, characterized in
          that it comprises a hydraulic actuator mountable to the base
          of the underground shield, to which there is connected a
          rotary device for taking over and dissipating the energy of
          rocks falling on the hood, wherein the device for taking over
          and dissipating energy comprises a ram element mounted to the
          actuator, slidably coupled by means of ram guides with side
          walls of a base plate mountable to the hood, which cooperates
          with at least two serially connected racks mounted slidably on
          a runner and driving toothed wheels of the kinetic energy
          rotary accumulators, wherein distances are created between the
          ram element and the first rack, as well as between the
          particular racks, said distances enabling the displacement of
          the ram element in relation to racks, as well as the
          displacement of these racks in relation to one another, such
          as to enable the moving ram element to pass the kinetic energy
          of the translational movement to the kinetic energy rotary
          accumulators in order to transform it to the kinetic energy of
          rotational movement.<br>
          <br>
          Preferably, the kinetic energy rotary accumulators have
          different energy accumulating abilities.<br>
          <br>
          Preferably, the kinetic energy rotary accumulators have
          different moments of inertia.<br>
          <br>
          Preferably, the kinetic energy rotary accumulator driven by
          the first rack has a smaller moment of inertia than the
          kinetic energy rotary accumulator driven by the second rack.<br>
          <br>
          Preferably, the kinetic energy rotary accumulators are driven
          by transmissions increasing angular speed, which have
          different transmission ratios.<br>
          <br>
          Preferably, the kinetic energy rotary accumulator has a
          one-way clutch. The protective arrangement according to the
          invention comprises a device for absorbing and dissipating
          energy of impact, wherein as a result of serial connection of
          the ram element with at least two serially connected racks
          which drive toothed wheels of kinetic energy rotary
          accumulators, with distances provided between the said racks,
          it is assured gradual driving in rotation of the subsequent
          kinetic energy rotary accumulators, what enables an abrupt
          increase of energy taking over ability of the device according
          to the invention. Cushioning elements fastened in the front of
          the racks in series decrease the percussive load of elements
          cooperating when starting the subsequent kinetic energy
          accumulators. The device according to the invention is
          suitable both for taking over small as well as great impact
          energy. In the first case the device ensures the effective and
          very gentle takeover of the impact energy because kinetic
          energy of progressive motion is carried out by kinetic energy
          rotary accumulators having the least moment of inertia. In the
          second case the device according to the invention provides
          also effective and uniform dissipation of the impact energy
          because taking over of kinetic energy of progressive motion is
          carried out by several kinetic energy rotary accumulators
          having ever greater energy taking over ability.<br>
          <br>
          In a case of collisions of greater energy, in the device
          according to the invention there appears also an additional
          beneficial effect consisting in that kinetic impact energy,
          before being taken over by the kinetic energy rotary
          accumulators having the greater moment of inertia, is
          accumulated in its substantial part by kinetic energy rotary
          accumulators having the smaller moment of inertia. Such an
          order of taking over the energy provides the gentler operation
          of the device according to the invention during starting of
          next kinetic energy rotary accumulators, even those having the
          greatest moment of inertia.<br>
          <br>
          By using a one-way clutch, the free rotation of the kinetic
          energy rotary accumulator is provided after taking over the
          impact energy until the energy accumulated in it is
          dissipated.<br>
          <br>
          Therefore, it is possible to absorb impacts on the hood from
          rocks of different masses, falling from different heights.
          This allows to make the hood 101 from lighter materials than
          in case of hoods that are not so effectively dampened.<br>

          </b><b>MODES FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</b><br>
          <br>
          Fig. 1 shows schematically an embodiment of an underground
          shield with a hood 101 protected by hydraulic actuators,
          wherein protective arrangements, shown in details in Fig. 2,
          are used. The hood 101 is supported on the base 102 of the
          vehicle by means of hydraulic actuators 103, at the ends of
          which there is mounted a rotary device 1 10 for taking over
          and dissipating energy of impact of rocks to the hood 101 ,
          described in details with reference to Figs. 3-8. The ram
          element 1 of the device 1 10 is mounted to the actuator 103
          and the base plate 13 is mounted to the hood 101 .<br>
          <br>
          As shown in the embodiment of Fig. 3, the rotor device for
          taking over and dissipating impact energy has a ram element 1
          made as a beam and coupled with three racks 2, 3, 4 connected
          in series. Between the racks 2, 3, 4, as well as between the
          ram element 1 and the first rack 2 distances 5, 6, 7 are
          formed which enable an action of cushioning elements 8 and
          cause that the racks 2, 3, 4 shift in relation to one another,
          as well as in relation to the ram element 1 . Each of the
          racks 2, 3, 4 meshes with a toothed wheel 9 driving a kinetic
          energy rotary accumulator 10, 1 1 , 12, whereas in order to
          achieve greater effectiveness of impact energy receiving and
          dissipating, the first kinetic energy rotary accumulator 10
          driven by the first rack 2 has the least inertia moment, the
          second kinetic energy rotary accumulator 1 1 driven by the
          second rack 3 has an average inertia moment, and the third
          kinetic energy rotary accumulator 12 driven by the third rack
          4 has the greatest inertia moment.<br>
          <br>
          The ram element 1 is slidably engaged with side walls of a
          body plate 13 by means of ram runners 14, whereas these ram
          runners 14 are fastened perpendicularly to the ram element 1 .
          Moreover, a runner 15 is fastened to the body plate 13, said
          guide ensuring shifting of the racks 2, 3, 4 in a suitable
          distance from the toothed wheels 9.<br>
          <br>
          As it is shown in Fig. 4, the cushioning elements 8 are
          located in cylindrical openings 16 made in the racks 2, 3, 4.
          These openings cooperate with pressing mandrels 17 carrying
          impact energy from the ram element 1 onto the consecutive
          racks 2, 3, 4. In embodiments illustrated in the figure the
          cushioning elements 8 have a form of helical springs, however
          this solution does not limit the possibility of using other
          cushioning elements such as, in particular, fluid or elastomer
          absorbers.<br>
          <br>
          As it is schematically shown in the cross section in Fig. 5,
          in an opening 18 formed in the body plate 13 there is an axle
          19 tightly fastened, with the rotatably mounted toothed wheel
          9 combined with an internal bush 20 of the kinetic energy
          rotary accumulator 12. The kinetic energy rotary accumulator
          12 has furthermore a one-way clutch 21 of the known
          construction situated in the annular space around the internal
          bush 20.<br>
          <br>
          In the second embodiment of the device according to the
          invention presented in Fig. 6, there are used the kinetic
          energy rotary accumulators 10, 1 1 , 12 having different
          moments of inertia and rack transmissions having different
          transmission ratios as the result of different pitch diameters
          of the used toothed wheels 9a, 9b, 9c. The kinetic energy
          rotary accumulator 10 having the least moment of inertia is
          driven by means of the toothed wheel 9a having the greatest
          pitch diameter, and the kinetic energy rotary accumulator 12
          having the greatest moment of inertia is driven by means of
          the toothed wheel 9c having the least pitch diameter. This
          construction according to the invention makes it possible to
          obtain increased progressiveness of taking over the impact
          energy by successively started kinetic energy rotary
          accumulators. The characteristic of the progressiveness of
          taking over the impact energy by the consecutive kinetic
          energy rotary accumulators 10, 1 1 , 12 in the embodiment
          shown in Fig. 6 can be therefore shaped across by selecting
          pitch diameters of the driving toothed wheels 9a, 9b, 9c and
          by selecting moments of inertia of the consecutive kinetic
          energy rotary accumulators 10, 1 1 , 12.<br>
          <br>
          The arrow which is perpendicular to the external surface of
          the ram element drawn in Fig. 3, Fig. 4 and Fig. 6 shows the
          expected direction of an impact load. Every angular deflection
          of the impact load from the expected direction increases the
          probability of the damage of the device and causes the
          reduction of the efficiency of taking over and dispersing
          impact energy. Therefore, the device according to the
          invention should be mounted in objects exposed to results of
          the unexpected collision in such a way that the expected
          impact load is substantially perpendicular to the external
          surface of the ram element 1 .<br>
          <br>
          In the embodiment shown in Fig. 6 the ram element 1 is
          connected slidably with the body plate 13 by means of ram
          runners 14a which are mounted slidably in openings 22 made in
          the body plate 13 parallel to the runner 15 of the racks 2, 3,
          4. Such a solution provides the increased shape rigidity of
          the whole device and can be used also in case of larger
          angular deviations of the impact load from the direction
          perpendicular to the external surface of the ram element 1 .<br>
          <br>
          As it is shown in Fig. 7, one-way clutch 21 of the known
          construction is situated between the inner bush 20 and an
          inner surface of the kinetic energy rotary accumulator 1 1 .<br>
          <br>
          The one-way clutch 21 is used to transmit the torque from the
          internal bush 20 to the kinetic energy rotary accumulator 10,
          1 1 , 12. After taking over the impact energy, when the
          angular speed of the internal bush 20 is smaller than the
          angular speed of the suitable kinetic energy rotary
          accumulator 10, 1 1 , 12, the one-way clutch 21 is
          disconnected to enable free rotation of the kinetic energy
          rotary accumulator 10, 1 1 , 12.<br>
          <br>
          Thanks to enabling the free rotation of the kinetic energy
          rotary accumulators 10, 1 1 , 12 the kinetic energy stored in
          a short time of an impact can be dissipated in a significantly
          longer time.<br>
          <br>
          In Fig. 8 the device according to the invention is shown
          during taking over the impact energy. Sliding linear motions
          and rotary motions of particular parts of the device
          respectively are shown in this figure with arrow lines. To
          enable taking over of the impact energy by the device
          according to the invention, the body plate 13 is fastened to
          the hood 101 (not shown in the drawing) by fastening elements
          23. Depending on energy taking over capacity of the device
          according to the invention, fastening elements 23 can be
          realized by welding, riveting, gluing, screwing and any other
          possible connections which can be used in a construction of an
          object protected against results of a collision.<br>
          <br>
          The energy acting during the impact on the ram element 1 ,
          transferred by racks 2, 3, 4 to the kinetic energy rotary
          accumulators 10, 1 1 , 12, is initially absorbed by the
          cushioning elements 8. Because of a serial connection of racks
          2, 3, 4, the kinetic energy rotary accumulators 10, 1 1 , 12
          begin their work one after another starting from the kinetic
          energy rotary accumulator 10 having the least moment of
          inertia, and finishing with the kinetic energy rotary
          accumulator 12 having the greatest moment of inertia. In the
          solution according to the invention the maximum idle stroke of
          the ram element 1 in relation to the last rack 4 which drives
          the kinetic energy rotary accumulator 12 having the greatest
          moment of inertia is equal to the sum of distances 5, 6, 7
          between the ram element 1 and the first rack 2, as well as
          among particular racks 2, 3, 4.<br>
          <br>
          In the device according to the invention, in the working
          position illustrated in Fig. 8 during taking over of the
          impact energy, the distances 5, 6, 7 existing in the rest
          state are decreased to the size 5a, 6a, 7a. At such position
          of the racks 2, 3, 4 all of the kinetic energy rotary
          accumulators 10, 1 1 , 12 are driven, whereas in this position
          the kinetic energy accumulator 10 having the least moment of
          inertia has the greatest angular speed, the kinetic energy
          accumulator 1 1 having the average moment of inertia has the
          average angular speed, and the kinetic energy accumulator 12
          having the greatest moment of inertia has the least angular
          speed.<br>
          <br>
          In case of taking over greater impact energies by the rotor
          device according to the invention, the distances 5a, 6a, 7a
          can reach the zero value and in this case linear speeds of the
          moving racks 2, 3, 4 are equal, and at equal ratios of the
          rack transmissions, the angle velocities of the kinetic energy
          rotary accumulators 10, 1 1 , 12 are also equal.<br>

            <b>SUPPORT UNIT OF INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE </b><br>
          </div>
          <br>
          The present invention relates to support unit of internal
          combustion engines, in which there are at least two
          energy-consuming support brackets between the combustion
          engine block and the body supporting structure, wherein at
          least one of supporting brackets is a rotor arrangement for
          absorbing and dissipating kinetic energy, in which kinetic
          energy of a progressive movement is converted into rotational
          movement kinetic energy, and the rotor arrangement comprises
          slidable support fixed to the engine block and a housing fixed
          to the body supporting structure, between which two racks are
          installed being in mesh with toothed wheels driving the
          kinetic energy rotor accumulators of determined moment of
          inertia, characterized in that, the slidable support (9)
          cooperates with at least two serially coupled racks (12, 13,
          14), slidably installed in the housing (19); and driving
          toothed wheels (15) of the kinetic energy rotor accumulators
          (16, 17, 18), wherein between the slidable support (9) and the
          first rack (12), as well as between the racks (12, 13, 14),
          gaps are defined, and between at least two serially coupled
          racks (12, 13, 14) a shock absorbing elements (20) are
          situated, enabling for translocation of the racks (12, 13, 14)
          with relation to each other.<br>
          <br>
          Unbalanced forces and moments of force existing during
          operation of internal combustion engines, in particular the
          one of a number of cylinders smaller than six, induce
          vibrations of the whole vehicle body, thus resulting in a
          decrease of a travelling comfort. Furthermore the support
          points of internal combustion engines, in particular in
          motorcars, require specific constructional reinforcements in
          regards to great individual tensions related with a necessity
          of shock absorption of the considerable engine mass.<br>
          <br>
          Known support arrangements of internal combustion engines
          usually comprise a metal-rubber support bracket embedded on a
          specifically reinforced support construction of the body. In a
          case of occurrence great random vibrations caused by irregular
          work of an engine and by force caused by the vehicle wheels,
          such metal- rubber support brackets do not provide high
          efficiency of energy accumulation.<br>
          <br>
          Known support arrangements of internal combustion engines can
          use also hydraulic systems, such as shock absorber as
          disclosed in PL164107, in which between supporting elements of
          vibrating device two-sided piston rod is situated. Vibration
          of the supported device drive piston rod, which pumps oil over
          from one chamber to another. Throttle of flowing oil causes
          conversion of kinetic energy of vibration into heat.<br>
          <br>
          German patent application DE3141024 discloses a device for
          generation of energy by using vibrations of other devices. In
          this known solution vibrations are converted into kinetic
          energy of a rotational movement. Torque generated in this
          manner is transferred by medium of toothed gear, with
          employment of fly-wheels, and also by hydraulic arrangements
          in order to be used for driving other electrical or mechanical
          devices.<br>
          <br>
          From international patent application WO2004028864 a device
          for absorbing and dissipating impact energy is known, in which
          kinetic energy generated rapidly in a result of an impact is
          converted into kinetic energy of rotating masses. In this
          known solution a beater element is connected with two toothed
          bars which by medium of toothed wheels drive rotor in forms of
          rods with moveable weights slidably mounted on the rods.
          Minimalization of impact load of the cooperating elements
          during the initial phase of an energy transfer is realized in
          this known solution by employment of the moveable weights
          disposed as close as possible to the rotation axis of the
          rotor in order that a moment of inertia of the rotor in this
          phase be as small as possible. In a further movement phase
          while the rotor starts to rotate, the weights start to
          translocate under influence of centrifugal force and move away
          from the rotation axis along the rod axis, until they reach
          their terminal positions in the vicinity of the end limiters.
          In such positions of the weights the biggest moment of inertia
          of rotor is achieved that enables for absorption of the
          increased kinetic energy.<br>
          <br>
          International application WO2005121593 discloses a device for
          absorbing energy comprising a beater element cooperating with
          an energy dissipation arrangement comprising a toothed bar
          inducing rotation of rotating masses, thus causing a
          conversion of progressive movement kinetic energy resulted
          from an impact into kinetic energy of a rotational movement.
          In one of disclosed embodiments of this known solution, the
          toothed bar drives a rotor by means of a toothed wheel,
          wherein the rotor cooperates with a moveable weights. In order
          to provide a progressive change of a moment of inertia of the
          rotor during a process of energy absorption, the moveable
          weights are maintained in appropriate distance from a rotation
          axis by means of springs.<br>
          <br>
          The known solutions do not provide effective absorption of
          different amounts of vibration energy related with different
          amplitudes of vibrations. Therefore the object of the present
          invention is to provide better efficiency of absorption of
          different random vibrations occurring between the body and the
          engine and dissipation of energy of these vibrations to not to
          transfer vibrations to the whole body.<br>
          <br>
          According to the present invention, there are at least two
          energy-consuming support brackets between the combustion
          engine block and the body supporting structure, wherein at
          least one of supporting brackets is a rotor arrangement for
          absorbing and dissipating kinetic energy, in which kinetic
          energy of a progressive movement is converted into rotational
          movement kinetic energy, and the rotor arrangement comprises
          slidable support fixed to the engine block and a housing fixed
          to the body supporting structure, between which racks are
          installed being in mesh with toothed wheels driving the
          kinetic energy rotor accumulators of determined moment of
          inertia. The present invention is characterised in that the
          slidable support cooperates with at least two serially coupled
          racks slidably installed in the housing and driving toothed
          wheels of the kinetic energy rotor accumulators. Between the
          slidable support and the first rack, as well as between the
          racks, gaps are defined, and between at least two serially
          coupled racks a shock absorbing elements are situated enabling
          for translocation of the racks with relation to each other.<br>
          <br>
          The kinetic energy rotor accumulators preferably have
          differentiated capability of energy accumulation.<br>
          <br>
          The kinetic energy rotor accumulators preferably have
          differentiated moments of inertia.<br>
          <br>
          By means of the gaps defined between the racks and by means of
          shock absorbing elements situated between at least two
          serially coupled racks there is provided a gradual actuation
          of successive kinetic energy rotor accumulators. That enables
          for adjustment of capability of shock absorption of support
          unit with relation to varied amplitude of vibrations of
          engines and forces existing during rocking of body when
          driving over rough road surfaces.<br>
          <br>
          Use of differentiated moments of inertia of successive kinetic
          energy rotor accumulators, especially if kinetic energy rotor
          accumulator driven by means of the first rack has smaller
          moment of inertia that the moment of inertia of the kinetic
          energy rotor accumulator driven by means of the second rack,
          enables for smooth and gradual increase of capability of
          kinetic energy accumulation in case of vibrations of big
          amplitude.<br>
          <br>
          The support unit according to the present invention is
          suitable for absorbing energy in case of vibrations of small
          amplitude and low kinetic energy as well as in case of
          vibrations of big amplitude and high kinetic energy. In the
          first instance, the support unit according to the present
          invention provides an efficient and very smooth shock
          absorption of vibrations, as an absorption of kinetic energy
          of progressive movement takes place with using kinetic energy
          rotor accumulators of the smallest moment of inertia. In the
          second instance, the support unit according to the present
          invention also provides appropriately efficient and smooth
          shock absorption of vibrations, as kinetic energy absorption
          takes place with using several rotor accumulators of
          increasing energy.<br>
          <br>
          In case of vibrations of greater energy, an additional effect
          occurs consisting in that vibrations kinetic energy is in a
          great part accumulated in the rotor accumulators featuring
          lower energy absorption capability before the rotor
          accumulators featuring higher energy absorption capability are
          actuated. Such a sequence of energy absorption provides
          smoother operation of the support unit according to the
          present invention during actuation of next rotor accumulators,
          even those of the greatest capability of energy absorption
          featuring the biggest moment of inertia.<br>
          <br>
          The exemplary embodiments of the present invention are
          schematically presented below in connection with the attached
          drawings on which fig. 1 shows a side view of the support unit
          of internal combustion engines with a cross sectional view
          through the body supporting structure, and fig. 2 presents a
          side view of the supporting bracket being a rotor arrangement
          for absorbing and dissipating kinetic energy.<br>
          <br>
          As shown schematically in in the embodiment of Fig. 1 , the
          internal combustion engine 1 comprises crankshaft 2 with
          pistons 3. Pistons 3, as a result of reciprocatory motions,
          generate inertial forces 4, which by means of crankshaft
          bearings 5 and the crankshaft 2 are transferred to main
          bearing 6 of casing 7, which feet 8 are located on slidable
          supports 9 of energy-consuming support brackets in forms of
          kinetic energy absorption rotor arrangements 10 situated in
          profiles of the body supporting structure 11.<br>

          <br>
          As shown in the embodiment of Fig. 2 the slidable support 9 of
          kinetic energy absorption rotor arrangement 10 is coupled with
          three serially connected racks 12, 13, 14. Between the racks
          12,13, 14, as well as between the slidable support 9 and the
          first rack 12, gaps are defined enabling for proper operation
          of shock absorbing elements 20 in a form of helical springs
          and providing relative movement of racks 12, 13, 14 with
          relation to each other and between the slidable support 9. The
          return spring 21 cooperates with the last rack 14, supporting
          return of racks 12,13,14 to initial position. Each of the
          racks 12, 13, 14 is interengaged with the toothed wheel 15
          driving kinetic energy rotor accumulator 16, 17, 18, wherein
          for providing increased efficiency of absorption and
          dissipation of impact energy the first kinetic energy rotor
          accumulator 16 driven by means of the first rack 12 has the
          smallest moment of inertia, the second kinetic energy rotor
          accumulator 17 driven by means of the second rack 13 has the
          medium moment of inertia, while the third kinetic energy rotor
          accumulator 18 driven by means of the third rack 14 has the
          greatest moment of inertia.<br>
          <br>
          The slidable support 9 is slidably coupled with the side walls
          of the housing 19, to which also a guide of racks 2, 13, 14 is
          fixed.<br>
          <br>
          A progressivity characteristic of absorption of impact energy
          may therefore be adjusted by appropriate selection of
          effective diameters of the driving toothed wheels 15 and by
          appropriate selection of moments of inertia of successive
          kinetic energy rotor accumulators 16, 17, 18.<br>
          <br>
          In the disclosed exemplary embodiments of the present
          invention also unidirectional couplings are used (not
          presented on drawings), disposed between toothed wheels 15 and
          the kinetic energy rotor accumulator 16, 17, 18. The function
          of the unidirectional couplings is to transfer a torque to the
          kinetic energy rotor. After absorbing the energy of an impact,
          when the angular velocity of the appropriate toothed wheel
          shall be smaller than the angular velocity of the appropriate
          kinetic energy rotor accumulator 16, 17, 18, then the
          unidirectional coupling becomes disconnected thus enabling for
          unrestricted rotation of the kinetic energy rotor accumulator
          16, 17, 18.<br>
          <br>
          Energy acting during an operation of internal combustion
          engine 1 on the slidable support 9 is transferred by means of
          the racks 12, 13, 14 and the toothed wheels 15 to the kinetic
          energy rotor accumulators 6, 17, 18. In a result of serial
          arrangement of the racks 12, 13, 14, is realized a successive
          actuation of kinetic energy rotor accumulators 16, 17, 18
          starting from the kinetic energy rotor accumulator 16 of the
          smallest moment of inertia, and ending with the kinetic energy
          rotor accumulator 18 of the greatest moment of inertia. In the
          solution according to the present invention, the maximal idle
          stroke of the slidable support 9 relative to the last rack 14
          driving the kinetic energy rotor accumulator 18 of the
          greatest moment of inertia is the sum of the gaps between the
          slidable element 9 and the first rack 12 and between the racks
          12, 13,14.<br>

          A road barrier comprising a support (101) to which a
          transverse beam (102) is connected via a spacer (110) such
          that upon impact the transverse beam (102) moves towards the
          support (101). The spacer (110) is movable upon impact and
          coupled, via coupling means (130, 150, 160, 170), with a
          rotatable energy absorber (140) mounted below the transverse
          beam (102) and comprising at least one rotor (142, 143) for
          absorbing in rotational movement at least part of the kinetic
          energy imparted to the transverse beam (102).<br>
          <br>
          <b>TECHNICAL FIELD</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          [0001] The present invention relates to road barriers and
          methods for manufacturing thereof.<br>
          <br>
          <b>BACKGROUND ART</b><br>
          <br>
          [0002] Road barriers installed along the edges of roads
          protect vehicles from accidentally exiting the road. The
          barriers are usually made of transverse beams installed on
          posts.<br>
          <br>
          [0003] There are known road barriers in which the beam is
          distanced from the post and mounted to the post via an energy
          absorbing spacer. A barrier of this type is known from a PCT
          application WOO51 18958A1, which discloses a road safety
          barrier wherein the beam is mounted to the post via a spring.
          Upon impact, the beam moves towards the post and the energy of
          impact is at least partially absorbed by the spring. The
          amount of absorbed energy is therefore dependent on the
          parameters of the spring.<br>
          <br>
          [0004] A US patent application US20070007780 describes a
          kinetic energy absorber for connecting to a bumper of a car
          and comprising a rotor connected with the bumper via a toothed
          bar and a multiplying gear. Upon impact directed to the
          bumper, the translational motion of the bumper induces
          translational motion of the toothed bar, which induces
          rotation of the rotor. The displacement vector of the bumper
          is parallel to the displacement vector of the toothed bar
          driving the rotor.<br>
          <br>
          <b>DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
          <br>
          [0005] The aim of the invention is to provide a road barrier
          with alternative energy absorbing means.<br>
          <br>
          [0006] The object of the invention is a road barrier
          comprising a support to which a transverse beam is connected
          via a spacer such that upon impact the transverse beam moves
          towards the support. The spacer is movable upon impact and
          coupled, via coupling means, with a rotatable energy absorber
          mounted below the transverse beam and comprising at least one
          rotor for absorbing in rotational movement at least part of
          the kinetic energy imparted to the transverse beam.<br>
          <br>
          [0007] The rotatable energy absorber can be fixed to the
          support.<br>
          <br>
          [0008] The coupling means may comprise a rack having a first
          toothed bar coupled via a toothed wheel with a toothed bar of
          the spacer and a second toothed bar coupled via a toothed
          wheel transmission with the at least one rotor.<br>
          <br>
          [0009] The spacer can be configured to move in a substantially
          horizontal direction and the rack is configured to move in a
          substantially vertical direction.<br>
          <br>
          [0010] The rack may comprise a compressible element.<br>
          <br>
          [0011] The coupling means may comprise a strand connected at a
          first end to the spacer and at a second end to the rotatable
          energy absorber.<br>
          <br>
          [0012] The strand can be wound at the second end around a
          driving shaft of the rotatable energy absorber.<br>
          <br>
          [0013] The strand can be connected at the second end to a
          toothed bar coupled with a toothed wheel transmission of the
          rotatable energy absorber.<br>
          <br>
          [0014] The coupling means and the rotatable energy absorber
          can be housed within the support.<br>
          <br>
          [0015] The rotatable energy absorber can be fixed to a
          structure offset horizontally from the support.<br>
          <br>
          [0016] The coupling means may comprise vertical coupling means
          in a form of a rotatable shaft having a first end coupled with
          the spacer and configured to be induced into rotation upon
          movement of the spacer, and a second end located below the
          first end and coupled with a first end of horizontal coupling
          means having its second end coupled with the at least one
          rotor.<br>
          <br>
          [0017] The spacer may comprise a compressible element.<br>
          <br>
          [0018] The object of the invention is also a method for
          manufacturing of a road barrier comprising a support to which
          a transverse beam is connected via a spacer such that upon
          impact the transverse beam moves towards the support, wherein
          the spacer is movable upon impact and coupled, via coupling
          means, with a rotatable energy absorber fixed to the support
          below the transverse beam and comprising a toothed wheel
          transmission driving at least one rotor for absorbing in
          rotational movement at least part of the kinetic energy
          imparted to the transverse beam. The method comprises the
          steps of forming and balancing of the at least one rotor,
          forming and hardening of the toothed wheel transmission of the
          rotatable energy absorber and forming of the support, the
          coupling means and the transverse beam and assembling the
          elements to make the road barrier.<br>

          [0030] FIG. 1 shows an overview of a road barrier to which the
          present invention is applicable. The road barrier comprises
          supports 101, to which a transverse beam 102 is connected. The
          supports can have a form of a vertical post anchorable to the
          ground or a holder fixed to another vertical structure, such
          as a wall. The beam 102 is connected to the supports 101 via a
          movable spacer 110 such that upon impact the transverse beam
          102 moves towards the support 101.<br>
          <br>
          [0031] FIG. 2 shows the elements of the road barrier according
          to a first embodiment of the invention in a side view, and
          FIGS. 3 and 4 show the core elements of that embodiment in a
          perspective view from the left and right, respectively.
          Preferably, the core elements are all housed within the
          support, such as to protect them from external factors, such
          as dirt, rain or third persons. The movable spacer is coupled,
          via coupling means 130 in form of a rack 130, with a rotatable
          energy absorber 140 mounted below the transverse beam 102. As
          shown in FIG. 2, the rotatable energy absorber 140 can be
          fixed to the support 101. In particular, the transverse beam
          102 can be mounted in the upper portion of the support 101 and
          the rotatable energy absorber 140 can be mounted in the lower
          portion of the support 101. The movable spacer 110 drives a
          transmission 120, which in turn drives a rack 130. The spacer
          110 is movable in a first direction and the rack 130 is
          movable in a second direction tilted with respect to the first
          direction. Therefore, upon impact, at least part of the energy
          imparted to the transverse beam 102 in the first direction of
          the movement of the spacer 110 is passed to the rack 130
          movable in the second direction. The rack 130 is coupled at
          its second end with a rotatable energy absorber 140 with at
          least one rotor 142, 143 which absorbs in rotational movement
          at least part of the kinetic energy imparted to the transverse
          beam 102. The amount of energy accumulated in the rotor 142,
          142 in other words a rotatable mass, depends on the weight and
          the moment of inertia of the rotor, its diameter and
          rotational speed, which in turn depends on the parameters of
          the transmission between the beam 102 and the rotor 142, 143.
          Preferably, the rotors 142, 143 are freewheels.<br>
          <br>
          [0032] The transmission 120 can be a toothed wheel mounted on
          a shaft attached to the housing of the support 101. The spacer
          110 and the rack 130 can be coupled with the transmission 120
          via toothed bars 111, 131. The rack 130 can have a toothed bar
          132 coupled with a toothed wheel 141 of the rotatable energy
          absorber 140. However, other types of transmission can be
          used, such as pneumatic, hydraulic, magnetic, etc.<br>
          <br>
          [0033] The rotatable energy absorber 140 comprises at least
          one rotor 142, 143, preferably in form of one or more
          flywheels, mounted on shafts fixed to the support 101. The
          rotor is coupled with the rack 130 via a transmission which
          may comprise one or more toothed wheels 144, 145, 146. The
          movement of the rack 130 induces rotation of the toothed
          wheels 141, 144, 145, 146 and therefore the rotation of the
          rotor 142, 143.<br>
          <br>
          [0034] The elements are preferably arranged on two main
          vertical planes, for example elements 110, 111, 20, 144, 145,
          146 are arranged on one main plane and elements 130, 131, 132,
          141, 142, 143 are arranged on another main plane. This
          provides compact size of the energy absorbing mechanism
          according to the invention and allows to house it within the
          support 101.<br>
          <br>
          [0035] As shown in FIG. 2, the spacer 110 is configured to
          move in a substantially horizontal direction and the rack 130
          is configured to move in a substantially vertical direction,
          preferably downwards. Mounting of the rotatable energy
          absorber 140 below the transverse beam 102 lowers the centre
          of gravity of the road barrier and increases its stability
          during impact.<br>
          <br>
          [0036] FIG. 5 shows the operating principle of the road
          barrier during impact. An impact force imparted to the
          transverse beam 102 causes movement of the spacer 110 towards
          the support 101 and, via the transmission 120, movement of the
          rack 130 downwards. The downwards movement of the rack 130
          induces rotation of the at least one rotor 142, 143 of the
          rotatable energy absorber 140. At least part of the impact
          energy is therefore converted to the kinetic energy of the
          rotor 142, 143.<br>
          <br>
          [0037] FIG. 6 shows the elements of the road barrier according
          to a second embodiment of the invention in a side view. The
          second embodiment is equivalent to the first embodiment, with
          the following differences. The spacer 110 may comprise a
          compressible element 112, such as a spring or a damper.
          Furthermore, the rack 130 may comprise a compressible element
          133, such as a spring or a damper. The compressible elements
          112, 133 allow absorbing of a part of energy during the first
          phase of impact and facilitate inducing the rotation of the
          rotatable energy absorber 140.<br>
          <br>
          [0038] FIG. 7 shows the elements of the road barrier according
          to a third embodiment of the invention in a side view. The
          movable spacer 110 is coupled, via coupling means 150 in form
          of a strand 150, with a rotatable energy absorber 140 fixed to
          the support 101 below the transverse beam 102. The strand 150
          is connected at a first end 151 to the movable spacer 110 and
          at a second end 152 to the rotatable energy absorber 140. A
          roller 153 defines the pathway of the strand 150 along the
          support 101. Upon impact, at least part of the energy imparted
          to the transverse beam 102 in the first direction of the
          movement of the spacer 110 is passed to the strand 150. The
          second end 152 of the strand 150 is wound around a driving
          shaft 147 of the rotatable energy absorber 140 such that when
          impact is imparted to the spacer 110 and the spacer moves into
          the support, the tension of the strand 150 induces rotation of
          the driving shaft 147 of the rotatable energy absorber 140
          and, consequently, rotation of the toothed wheels 144, 145,
          146 and of the rotors 142, 143.<br>
          <br>
          [0039] FIG. 8 shows the elements of the road barrier according
          to a fourth embodiment of the invention in a side view. The
          fourth embodiment is equivalent to the third embodiment, with
          the following differences. The second end 154 of the strand
          150 is attached to a toothed bar 154 coupled with a toothed
          wheel transmission 141 of the rotatable energy absorber 140
          such that when impact is imparted to the spacer 110 and the
          spacer 110 moves into the support 101, the tension of the
          strand 150 induces, via the toothed bar 154, rotation of the
          toothed transmission 141 of the rotatable energy absorber 140
          and, consequently, rotation of the toothed wheels 144, 145,
          146 and of the rotors 142, 143.<br>
          <br>
          [0040] FIG. 9 shows the elements of the road barrier according
          to a fifth embodiment of the invention in a perspective view.
          The rotatable energy absorber 140 is fixed to a structure 103
          offset horizontally from the support 101, to which the spacer
          110 is fixed. The structure 103 can be a ground anchor located
          aside the post. The structure 103 can be also a neighbouring
          post, to which the transverse beam 102 is connected. In this
          embodiment, the coupling means comprise vertical and
          horizontal coupling, for transferring the energy of impact
          both in vertical and horizontal direction. The vertical
          coupling means may have a form of a vertical rotatable shaft
          160, preferably housed within the support 101. The first end
          161 of the vertical shaft 160 is coupled with the spacer 110
          and configured to be induced into rotation upon translational
          movement of the spacer 110. In one example, the first end 161
          of the vertical shaft may be a toothed wheel coupled with a
          toothed bar at the end of the spacer 110. In another example,
          as shown in FIG. 9, a strain may be connected between the end
          of the spacer 110 and wound around a disc mounted at the end
          161 of the shaft 160. The horizontal coupling means 170 may
          have a form of a toothed bar, coupled at one end 171 with a
          toothed wheel at the second end 162 of the shaft 160 and at
          another end 172 with the rotor 142. Alternatively, as shown in
          FIG. 9, the horizontal coupling means 170 may have a form of a
          strand, wound at one end 171 around the second end 162 of the
          shaft 160 and at another end 172 around a disc mounted on the
          shaft of the rotor 142. Horizontally offsetting the rotatable
          energy absorber 140 from the support 101 allows using various
          kinds of rotatable energy absorbers 140, which do not have to
          accommodate within the housing of the support 101. In all
          embodiments, the rotors of the rotatable energy absorbers may
          be mounted so as to rotate around a horizontal or vertical
          axis, depending on the desired configuration.<br>
          <br>
          [0041] FIG. 10 shows the process of manufacturing of the road
          barrier according to the invention. In steps 301-306 the
          elements via which the impact energy is transmitted to the
          rotatable energy absorber are formed, including the rotor
          formed in step 301, the toothed bars formed in step 303 and
          the toothed wheels formed in step 305. The elements are
          manufactured with high degree of precision, such as to allow
          efficient movement of the elements with limited friction upon
          impact of forces of large magnitude. The rotor is balanced in
          step 302 by precise profiling such that it can rotate with
          high rotational speeds. The teeth of the toothed bars and
          toothed wheels are hardened in steps 304, 306 such as to
          withstand large forces and limit the friction between them.
          The other elements of the road barrier, such as the post and
          the transverse beam, are formed in step 307 and assembled in
          step 308. In order to provide high precision of manufacture of
          the energy absorber and the other components of the road
          barrier of the invention, the following tools can be used: a
          water jet cutter, a band saw, welding machines, a standard
          lathe, a precision lathe, a standard miller, a precision
          miller, a surface grinder, an external grinder, an internal
          grinder, a standard drill, a pillar drill, a hydraulic press,
          a brake press, a bending machine for tubes and sections, a
          hydraulic bending machine, a belt grinder, a fitter's vice, a
          compressor, an electro-erosion machine, a hobber, a threader,
          a welder, cleaning tanks, measurement and control apparatus, a
          hardening furnace, an electronic balancer, a marking-off table
          and marking-off tools.<br>
          <br>
          [0042] The road barrier may comprise supports of the first
          and/or second embodiment, and in addition it may be also
          supported by other, typical supports. The supports of the
          first or second embodiment may be installed at places with
          high impact risk, such as sharp turns, while typical supports
          may be installed at straight segments of the road.<br>

          A shock absorbing platform for unloading containers at ports,
          comprising the top plate (1) guided vertically by means of
          guides (3) and disposed substantially on the same level as the
          surrounding stage (13) and a shock-absorbing means connected
          with the plate and comprising kinetic energy absorption rotor
          arrangements (10), characterized in that it comprises an
          angular drive train arrangement (7) having an input rod (6)
          and at least one output rod (8) perpendicular to said input
          rod (6), wherein the input rod (6) is coupled with the top
          plate (1) and the output rod (8) is connected to the kinetic
          energy absorption rotor arrangement (10), comprising at least
          two serially coupled racks (12, 13, 14) driving the toothed
          wheel (16, 17, 18), wherein between at least two serially
          connected racks (12, 13, 14) shock-absorbing means (20); are
          arranged enabling for relative displacement of the racks (12,
          13, 14) in relation to each other.<br>
          <br>
          The present invention relates to a shock absorbing platform
          for unloading containers at ports, designed to protecting
          containers or vehicles during loading operation against
          effects of an excessively rapid drop of the unloaded commodity
          during unloading operation. Bringing containers down onto
          sea-platform constitutes a significant problem. Unloading
          process depends on atmospheric conditions existing on the sea.
          Strong winds blowing frequently, lateral oscillation caused by
          a movement of sea-waves or sea-currents result in great losses
          related with damages of containers hitting sea- platforms. The
          force of impact of a container against a platform is dependent
          on an instantaneous weather conditions existing on the sea,
          and therefore an unloading operation may be impossible during
          a very short period of time.<br>
          <br>
          For providing shock absorption for containers being brought
          down, the plates of platforms are supported by means of
          resilient shock-absorbing arrangements. In different solutions
          containers in an unload operation are protected by employment
          of shield elements that are made of elastomeric materials and
          absorb impacts.<br>
          <br>
          Another system designed for absorbing kinetic energy is
          disclosed in international patent application WO2004028864
          describing a rotor device in which kinetic energy is converted
          into kinetic energy of rotating masses. In this known solution
          an element absorbing energy is connected with two toothed bars
          which by medium of toothed wheels drive kinetic energy rotor
          accumulators in forms of rods with moveable weights slidably
          mounted on the rods. An appropriate progressiveness of energy
          absorption is obtained in this known solution by employment of
          the moveable weights located as close to the rotation axis of
          the rotor with the rods as possible in order that a moment of
          inertia of the rotor in the initial phase of energy absorption
          be as small as possible. In further movement phase while the
          rotor starts to rotate, the weights start to translocate under
          influence of centrifugal force and move away from the rotation
          axis along the rod axis, until they reach the rod end limiters
          and in such weight positions the biggest moment of inertia of
          rotor is achieved that enables for absorption of the increased
          kinetic energy. International patent application WO2005121593
          discloses a device for absorbing and dissipating kinetic
          energy comprising a beater element cooperating with a rack
          inducing by means of a toothed wheel a rotational movement of
          a kinetic energy rotor accumulator, in order to transform
          impact energy into kinetic energy of rotor accumulator
          rotational movement.<br>
          <br>
          Such known solutions do not provide high efficiency of a shock
          absorption for impacts of containers during bringing down
          operations at different bringing down velocities and different
          masses. Therefore the object of the present invention is to
          provide increased efficiency of absorbing and dissipating
          different and random energy amounts.<br>
          <br>
          A shock-absorbing platform according to the present invention
          comprises the top plate guided vertically by means of guides
          and disposed substantially on the same level as the
          surrounding stage and a shock-absorbing means connected with
          the plate and comprising kinetic energy absorption rotor
          arrangements. The solution is characterized in that it
          comprises an angular drive train arrangement having an input
          rod and at least one output rod perpendicular to said input
          rod, wherein the input rod is coupled with the top plate and
          the output rod is connected to the kinetic energy absorption
          rotor arrangement, comprising at least two serially coupled
          racks driving the toothed wheel, wherein between at least two
          serially connected racks shock- absorbing means are arranged
          enabling for relative displacement of the racks in relation to
          each other.<br>
          <br>
          The kinetic energy rotor accumulators preferably have
          differentiated capability of energy accumulation.<br>
          <br>
          The kinetic energy rotor accumulators preferably have
          differentiated moments of inertia.<br>
          <br>
          The angular drive train arrangement preferably has a form of a
          hydraulic T-piece having one input cylinder and at least two
          output cylinders.<br>
          <br>
          Thanks to embedding shock absorbing elements between at least
          two serially connected racks, appropriate gaps are formed
          therebetween, that provides gradual inducing rotational
          movements of alternate kinetic energy rotor accumulators, and
          thus in turn it enables for obtaining an abrupt stepped
          increase of capability of energy absorption. Such a
          construction enables for adjustment of shock absorbing
          capability of the platform in dependence of requirements
          related with differentiated height from which containers drop
          down onto the platform and with differentiated mass of
          containers.<br>
          <br>
          Arrangement of shock absorbing elements in front of the
          alternate racks results in a decrease of impact load acting on
          cooperating elements during an actuation of alternate kinetic
          energy rotor accumulators.<br>
          <br>
          Owing to a gradation of moment of inertia of alternate kinetic
          energy rotor accumulator, in particular when kinetic energy
          rotor accumulator driving by means of the first rack has
          smaller moment of inertia than the moment of inertia of
          kinetic energy rotor accumulator driven by means of the second
          rack, especially advantageous, smooth and gradual increase of
          capability of absorbing kinetic energy related with a
          collision of the container with a platform is achieved. The
          device arrangement according to the present invention provides
          high efficiency of kinetic energy absorption during impacts of
          low kinetic energy as well as during impacts of higher kinetic
          energy. In the first instance the device according to the
          present invention provides efficient and very smooth impact
          energy absorption, as an absorption of kinetic energy of
          progressive movement takes place with using kinetic energy
          rotor accumulators of the smallest moment of inertia. In the
          second instance, the device according to the present invention
          also provides appropriately efficient and uniform
          shock-absorption of impact energy, as kinetic energy
          absorption takes place with using several rotor accumulators
          of increasing energy absorption capabilities. In case of
          impacts of greater energy an additional effect occurs in the
          device according to the present invention consisting in that
          impact kinetic energy is in a great part accumulated in the
          rotor accumulators featuring lower energy absorption
          capability before the rotor accumulators featuring higher
          energy absorption capability are actuated. Such a sequence of
          energy absorption provides smoother operation of the device
          according to the present invention during actuation of next
          rotor accumulators, even those of the greatest capability of
          energy absorption featuring the bigger moment of inertia.<br>

          6 of an angular drive train arrangement 7, and each of two
          output rod 8, oriented perpendicularly relative to the input
          rod 6, contacts a bumper 9 of kinetic energy absorption rotor
          arrangement 10. In this embodiment the angular drive train
          arrangement 7 has a form of a hydraulic T-piece 11 , in which
          the input rod 6 constitutes the rod of the input piston, and
          the output rod 8 constitutes the rods of the output pistons.
          As shown in Fig. 3, the bumper 9 of the kinetic energy
          absorption rotor arrangement 10 is coupled to three serially
          connected racks 12, 13, 14. Between the racks 12, 13, 14 and
          between the bumper 9 and the first rack 12 appropriate gaps
          are defined enabling appropriate operation of shock absorbing
          elements 20 and providing a relative displacement of racks 12,
          13, 14 relative to each other and between the bumper 9. Each
          of the racks 12, 13, 14 interengages with a toothed wheel 15
          driving a kinetic energy rotor accumulator 16, 17, 18, wherein
          for achieving greater efficiency of absorbing and dissipating
          impact energy, the first kinetic energy rotor accumulator 16
          driven by the first rack 12 has the smallest moment of
          inertia, the second kinetic energy rotor accumulator 17 driven
          by the second rack 13 has the medium moment of inertia,
          whereas the third kinetic energy rotor accumulator 18 driven
          by the third rack 4 has the greatest moment of inertia. The
          bumper 9 is slidably coupled to the side walls of the body
          plate 19 to which the guide of racks 12, 13, 14 is also
          attached.<br>
          <br>
          The progressiveness of a characteristic of impact energy
          absorption may be adjusted by appropriate selection of
          effective diameters of the driving toothed wheels 15 and by
          appropriate selection of moments of inertia of alternate
          kinetic energy rotor accumulators 16, 17, 18.<br>
          <br>
          In the described embodiments unidirectional couplings are also
          employed, though not presented on the drawing, and arranged
          between the toothed wheels 15 and kinetic energy accumulators
          16, 17, 18. The function of these unidirectional couplings is
          transferring a torque onto kinetic energy rotor accumulators.
          After absorption of energy, when angular velocity of the
          appropriate toothed wheel 15 shall be smaller than angular
          velocity of corresponding kinetic energy rotor accumulator 16,
          17, 18, the unidirectional coupling becomes disconnected thus
          enabling for unrestricted rotation of the kinetic energy rotor
          accumulator 16, 17, 18. Energy acting upon the bumper 9 during
          a drop of a container on the top plate 1 is transferred by
          medium of the rods 6, 8 of the hydraulic T-piece 11 to the
          racks 12, 13, 14, and subsequently to kinetic energy rotor
          accumulators 16, 17, 18. In a result of serial arrangement of
          the racks 12, 13, 14, a consecutive actuation of kinetic
          energy rotor accumulators 16, 17, 18 is realized starting from
          the kinetic energy rotor accumulator 16 of the smallest moment
          of inertia, and ending with the kinetic energy rotor
          accumulator 18 of the greatest moment of inertia. In the
          solution according to the present invention, the maximal idle
          stroke of the bumper 9 relative to the endmost rack 14 driving
          the kinetic energy rotor accumulator 18 of the greatest moment
          of inertia equals the sum of the gaps between the bumper 9 and
          the first rack 1 and between the racks 12, 13, 14.<br>
