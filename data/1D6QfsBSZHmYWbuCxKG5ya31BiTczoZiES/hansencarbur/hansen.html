      <i>Herb Hansen (left) and Dale Pate point out how they converted a
        1975 Ford Pinto engine to run on an alcohol and water fuel
        mixture. "I'll be darned if it didn't finally work," Hansen says
        of the experiment. The car gets 20 to 25 per cent better mileage
        than with gasoline.</i><i><br>
      </i><br>
      Herbert Hansen and his shipmates aboard an American submarine in
      World War II used to sink Japanese shipping with torpedoes powered
      by alcohol and water.<br>
      <br>
      Now. 30 years later, Hansen and his fellow Inventor, Dale Pate,
      use the same mixture to power a 1925 Model T-Ford and a 1075 Ford
      Pinto.<br>
      <br>
      Both cars, although 50 years apart in sophistication and
      technology, run equally well on a vaporized fuel consisting of 90
      per cent alcohol and 10 per cent water.<br>
      <br>
      Each achieves 20 to 25 per cent better mileage on the fuel than
      with gasoline. Neither pollutes the environment with its exhaust.
      Neither suffers a loss in power or acceleration.<br>
      <br>
      And between them, the two cars have rolled in excess of 1,000
      trouble-free miles on the fuel mixture concocted by the two
      imaginative Elgin inventors.<br>
      <br>
      Now, I don't know -- and neither do they -- whether their
      brainstorm can bail out the United States from its petroleum .<br>
      <br>
      But after viewing the results of their work I'm hoping someone in
      Washington will look up with interest.<br>
      <br>
      Because at first blush, their system works beautifully. It scoots
      you down the highway at the same speeds and with the same pickup
      you would expect from gasoline.<br>
      <br>
      So even if there is some hidden flaw Hansen and Pate have yet to
      detect in their invention, certainly the technological geniuses of
      the federal government and the automotive industry should be able
      to solve it.<br>
      <br>
      Hansen first got the idea last fall while reminiscing about the
      days when he and the submarine crews launched torpedoes fueled by
      90 per cent alcohol and 10 per cent water. And the torpedoes shot
      through the water at 411 knots no hour for several miles to
      deliver their bulk on target.<br>
      <br>
      "I figured the same idea should work with a car," Hansen said. "So
      Pate and I got our heads together and started experimenting. And
      I'll be darned if it didn't finally work."<br>
      <br>
      The secret of their success is in the system they up to heat the
      fuel mixture to a temperature at which it would fire with maximum
      efficiency.<br>
      <br>
      Others, they said, have experimented with straight alcohol as an
      lve . but with less than spectacular results. Cold alcohol just
      doesn't work as well. For one thing, getting started is tougher.<br>
      <br>
      However, Hansen and Pate pre-heat the fuel before It is ignited in
      the cylinders. They also introduce water and moisturized air to
      further enhance efficiency.<br>
      <br>
      And the real beauty of their invention is that it does not require
      drastically altering a car or installing an entirely new fuel
      system. They merely add a few mechanical gimmicks and use the same
      fuel tank with which the car was endowed by Detroit.<br>
      <br>
      I went out to visit the two inventors in Hansen's home garage
      laboratory last week.<br>
      <br>
      Hansen is a mechanical engineer with senior status at Means &amp;
      Co. in Chicago. Pate is an Elgin police corporal in charge of that
      department's juvenile division.<br>
      <br>
      They first met in 1966, while working as volunteers restoring aged
      steam locomotives at the Illinois Railway Museum in Union
      Illinois. So as born tinkerers, it was inevitable that they should
      marshal their talents.<br>
      <br>
      Here is how the system works:<br>
      <br>
      The alcohol-and-water blend goes from the regular fuel tank to the
      fuel pump. Then it passes through a pre-heater using engine
      coolant to heat the fuel to 170 degrees fahrenheit on its way to
      the carburetor.<br>
      <br>
      This works best, of course, when the engine is warm. So for easy
      starting, on electric heater in the car does the same job the
      engine worms up. Starting usually requires about a 1-minute wait.<br>
      <br>
      In the carburetor, the alcohol and water mix is joined by
      moisturized air heated by the exhaust pipe and fed from a
      five-gallon tank of water that is refilled with every tankful of
      fuel.<br>
      <br>
      The moisturized air helps vaporize the fuel. And the mixture is
      Ignited in the cylinders, the moisture turns to super heated steam
      with tremendous expanding capacity to further improve power and
      fuel efficiency.<br>
      <br>
      The Hansen-Pate system is that simple. Even I can understand It.<br>
      <br>
      "The only exhaust produced is carbon and water," Hansen sid, "The
      some things you and I are exhaling."<br>
      <br>
      The only exhaust odor is that of burned alcohol. And the inventors
      overcome that by sprinkling a few drops of aftershave lotion In
      the fuel.<br>
      <br>
      "I suppose if you were driving a Cadillac, you'ld want to use
      Chanel No. 5 perfume instead," Pate quipped.<br>
      <br>
      The Model T-Ford, the first car tested with the system, Is not
      equipped with fuel heaters. So it doesn't run as well.<br>
      <br>
      However, the Ford Pinto has a switch on the dashboard that permits
      the interchange of fuels so that a driver can burn gasoline, if he
      chooses. The :i activates the fuel heaters when alcohol and waler
      are being used.<br>
      <br>
      'Vehicles can run on straight alcohol, but they only get 5 to 8
      miles to the gallon," Pate explained as he mixed a batch of
      alcohol and water in a one-ounce shotglass for a mileage test with
      the Pinto.<br>
      <br>
      "We've gotten up to 32 miles to the gallon with two people riding
      in the Pinto, which has a four-cylinder, 140-cc. engine with a
      four-speed transmission.<br>
      <br>
      "That was at 35 miles an hour. Naturally, at 55 m.p.h., you only
      get about 27 miles to the gallon. With an automatic transmission
      you'ld get about 2 miles less to the gallon ."<br>
      <br>
      "You can buy alcohol in bulk for $1.27 a gallon," Hansen said.<br>
      <br>
      'With 20 to 23 per cent better mileage, our fuel gets competitive
      with gasoline selling for $1.18 to $1.20 a gallon. And the price
      of gasoline is getting up there.<br>
      <br>
      "Further, our fuel is a domestic source of renewable energy. You
      can make alcohol from organic wastes, as well as plant matter.
      Even garbage dumps can produce alcohol. That way, you don't have
      to import anything.<br>
      <br>
      "We believe this Is a revolutionary idea whose time has come and
      that it is the only viable alternative to gasoline."<br>
      <br>
      Pate and Hansen have applied for a patent. So now, all they are
      for is someone to come to their door with sufficient capital to
      bankroll their invention.<br>
      <br>
      I hope the guy shows up soon.<br>

            Work?</b></big><br>

      <br>
      ...Herb Hanson, an engineer in Elgin, Ill., has developed a
      preheating, vaporizing carburetor for alcohol -- the first of its
      kind.<br>
      <br>
      "We consistently get 70 to 75 mpg in a Ford Pinto on 140-proof
      alcohol. The car got 32 mpg maximum on gasoline," Hanson told FARM
      SHOW. "There's no pollution and the car has as much or more power.
      We're trying to find a manufacturer right now to produce it."<br>
      <br>
      Hanson's new fuel system uses both the heat of the engine and two
      100-watt electric immersion heaters to vaporize alcohol before
      it's fed to the cylinders through a conventional propane gas
      regulator. The car actually starts on propane and runs on it for
      about 5 min. until the engine warms up.<br>
      <br>
      "In converting a vehicle, we remove the carburetor, radiator, fan,
      and catalytic converter. The vaporizer mounts where the radiator
      was. Because the engine burns cooler with alcohol, you don't need
      that cooling system. And it burns clean enough so the catalytic
      converter is wasted equipment," explains Hanson.<br>
      <br>
      <hr size="2" width="100%"><br>
      <div align="center"><big><b>Vapour fuel system for an internal
            combustion engine.</b></big><br>
        <big><b>EP0045601</b></big><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      An internal combustion engine is operated with an alcohol fuel
      heated by a heat exchanger and vaporized by a series of electric
      heating elements prior to combustion. The heat exchanger uses
      waste heat from the engine coolant. In addition, means for heating
      and humidifying the combustion air is provided to insure complete
      vaporization of the alcohol fuel and to overcome the lower caloric
      power potential of alcohol as compared to gasoline.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Background of the Invention</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The present invention relates generally to an internal combustion
      engine operable with an alcohol fuel and, specifically, to a fuel
      system for supplying a vaporized fuel to the engine. The term
      alcohol as used herein includes a variety of hydroxyl derivatives
      of hydrocarbons, such as, methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, tertiary
      butanol and mixtures thereof with or without water.<br>
      <br>
      Internal combustion engines operated with alcohol or a blended
      gasoline-alcohol mixture have been in use for many years. Such
      blending, however, lowers the boiling point of the gasoline and
      thereby causes vapor lock in the fuel pump at a lower temperature
      than would be the case with pure gasoline. In addition, the
      introduction of water to a blended gasoline-alcohol fuel mixture
      causes the mixture to separate into its constituent phases. Since
      the resultant fuel supplied to the carburetor is not of constant
      composition and does not correspond to the composition to which
      the carburetor was initially adjusted, the engine malfunctions.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, the need exists for a fuel system which, in addition to
      overcoming the cold starting difficulties of an alcohol fueled
      engine, can operate with either gasoline, propane or alcohol.<br>
      <br>
      However, another problem exists. The use of a conventional
      carburetor often leads to inefficient combustion with unburned
      fuel passing through the exhaust manifold to the atmosphere. This
      inefficient combustion is evidenced by an increase in hydrocarbon
      emissions.<br>
      <br>
      As an alternative, the fuel can be injected. A fuel injected
      system introduces small droplets of fuel into an air stream for
      passage to a cylinder.<br>
      <br>
      The injection inlets usually have an inside diameter of at least
      0.050 inches. Although a fuel injected system is more efficient
      than a conventional carburetor, the injection of such large fuel
      droplets also results in incomplete combustion.<br>
      <br>
      In an ideal fuel system, the size of each droplet would approach
      that of a single molecule of fuel. If each fuel molecule could be
      surrounded by air, complete combustion would be possible. This
      would result in greater engine efficiency and power output as well
      as the possible elimination of all emissions other than carbon
      dioxide and water.<br>
      <br>
      By removing the carburetor and vaporizing the alcohol fuel, the
      present invention produces almost complete fuel combustion. In
      addition, any dependence on gasoline to overcome the cold starting
      difficulties normally associated with alcohol fueled engines is
      eliminated.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Summary of the Invention</b><br>
      <br>
      The invention provides means for reducing the dependence of an
      internal combustion engine on hydrocarbon fuels derived from crude
      oil. Specifically, the present invention provides a fuel system
      which supplies alcohol vapors to an engine and produces nearly
      complete combustion.<br>
      <br>
      Electrical means is provided to heat and vaporize the alcohol fuel
      prior to ignition and thus avoid the cold starting problems
      associated with the use of alcohol as fuel. In addition, means are
      provided to heat the alcohol prior to combustion using thermal
      energy generated by the engine under normal operating conditions.<br>
      <br>
      The method according to the present invention comprises the steps
      of conveying the alcohol to a heat exchanging device in which is
      incorporated an electric heating element, and transferring heat
      from. the electric heating element or the heated engine coolant to
      the alcohol. The heated alcohol flows through a conduit from the
      heat exchanger to a vaporization chamber which contains a second
      electric heating element.<br>
      <br>
      In the chamber the alcohol is heated to its boiling point. The
      alcohol vapors produced upon. boiling are then passed directly to
      the intake manifold of the engine. All components of the fuel
      system through which the heated alcohol and alcohol vapor flow are
      insulated to minimize heat loss.<br>
      <br>
      An additional heat exchanging device located on the exhaust line
      heats a solution of 5-50% alcohol in water to boiling. As a
      result, the vapor content and temperature of the air passing to
      the intake manifold is increased, and steam is created to maintain
      the alcohol that flows from the vaporization chamber in the
      gaseous state.<br>
      <br>
      It is an object of this invention to increase the efficiency of an
      alcohol operated internal combustion engine by providing means for
      vaporizing the alcohol fuel as well as means for heating and
      humidifying the air used in combustion.<br>
      <br>
      It is a further object of this invention to provide a means for
      overcoming the cold starting problems of an internal combustion
      engine operated with alcohol as fuel.<br>
      <br>
      Other objects and advantages will be apparent from the following
      detailed description made with reference to the accompanying
      drawings.<br>

      </b><b>Detailed Description of the Invention</b><br>
      <br>
      As illustrated in Figure 1, fuel is stored in a tank 10 and is
      drawn therefrom via conduit 12 under pressure produced by a fuel
      pump 14. The fuel may be selected from the group consisting of
      methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, tertiary butanol or mixtures
      thereof with or without water.<br>
      <br>
      The alcohol fuel flows through the conduit 12 to a heat exchanger
      16 at a pressure of anproxi- mately two pounds per square inch.
      The heat exchanger 16, best shown in Figure 2, is a hollow
      cylinder having a liquid coolant inlet 18 and outlet 20 plus a
      fuel inlet 22 and outlet 24. Liquid coolant from the internal
      combustion engine 26 is circulated by a water pump 28 through a
      hose 30 to the coolant inlet 18. The coolant circulates through
      the heat exchanger 16 and, via coolant outlet 20, returns to the
      engine 26 through a hose 32.<br>
      <br>
      Fuel flows from conduit 12 to the fuel inlet 22 of the heat
      exchanger and through a tube 34 located within heat exchanger 16.
      Tube 34 is connected to the fuel outlet 24. A conduit 36
      communicates the fuel outlet 24 of the heat exchanger 16 with an
      inlet 38 of a vaporization chamber 40.<br>
      <br>
      An elongated, rod-like electric heating element 42 is located
      within the heat exchanger 16, tube-34 being concentrically
      disposed about the heating element. The electric heating element
      supplements the heat from the engine to overcome the cold starting
      difficulties associated with use of alcohol fuel. A thermostat 44
      located between the heat exchanger 16 and the vaporization chamber
      40 controls the electric heating element 42. Electric heating
      element 42 is operated by power supply 47, which may be the
      vehicle's battery.<br>
      <br>
      The heated alcohol flows from the heat exchanger 16 through
      conduit 36 to the inlet 38 of the vaporization chamber 40. As
      illustrated in Figure 3, the vaporization chamber 40 has an outlet
      48 in addition to the inlet 38. The level of fluid in the
      vaporization chamber 40'is regulated by a valve 50 and a float 52.<br>
      <br>
      Electric heating element 54 located below the fluid level within
      the vaporization chamber 40 further heats the alcohol to boiling.
      A thermostat 53 located between the chamber 40 and the intake
      manifold 58 controls the electric heating element 54 and a ready
      light 55. The ready light indicates when the alcohol fuel is
      vaporized so that the engine can be started. The alcohol vapors
      produced flow through the outlet 48 to a conduit 56 which is
      connected to the intake manifold 58 of the engine 26. A butterfly
      valve 60 controls the volume of alcohol vapor which flows to the
      manifold. A safety valve 62 opens to release alcohol vapor if the
      pressure within the vaporization chamber 40 exceeds a
      predetermined value.<br>
      <br>
      Referring again to Figure 1, a conduit 64 communicates a tank 66
      with an exhaust gas heat exchanger 68. The alcohol-water solution
      contained in the tank 66 flows by gravity to the exhaust gas heat
      exchanger 68. The freezing of the alcohol-water solution at low
      temperatures is prevented by increasing the alcohol concentration
      within the range of 5 to 50% by volume to depress the freezing
      point of the solution.<br>
      <br>
      As further shown in Figure 1, the exhaust gas heat exchanger 68 is
      a hollow cylinder comprised, in part, of exhaust gas inlet 70,
      exhaust gas outlet 72, air inlet 74 and air outlet 76. Exhaust gas
      inlet 70 is connected via exhaust pipe 78 with the exhaust
      manifold 80 of the engine 26. The air outlet 76 is connected via a
      hose 82 with the intake manifold 58 of the engine 26. Exhaust gas
      outlet 72 and air inlet 74 are in communication with the
      atmosphere.<br>
      <br>
      Referring now to Figure 4, the exhaust gas inlet 70 is connected
      to exhaust gas outlet 72 by a plurality of heat transfer tubes,
      generally designated by the numeral 82. Surrounding the heat
      transfer tubes is a solution of 5-50% alcohol in water from tank
      66. The alcohol solution enters the heat exchanger 68 through an
      inlet 86. The level of the fluid in heat exchanger 68 is regulated
      by a valve 88 and a float 90.<br>
      <br>
      Hot exhaust gases are used to heat the alcohol-water solution in
      heat exchanger 68 to boiling. The gases are admitted at exhaust
      gas inlet 70, are passed through heat transfer tubes 84 and are
      released as cooled gases to the ambient atmosphere through exhaust
      gas outlet 72. Since the exhaust gases pass through a series of
      tubes, rather than through a single heat transfer tube, the
      surface area of the tubes in contact with the surrounding fluid is
      increased and maximum heat transfer from the gases passing through
      tubes 84 to the alcohol-water solution results.<br>
      <br>
      Incoming air through the air inlet 74 is deflected toward the
      surface of the boiling solution by a baffle 92. Thereafter, the
      air passes over the surface of the boiling solution, absorbs
      moisture and passes through the air outlet 76 to flow through hose
      82 to the intake manifold 58.<br>
      <br>
      The operation of the invention is as follows. Thermostat 44, which
      controls electric heating element 42, is adjusted to a temperature
      slightly less than the boiling point of the alcohol use For
      example, the boiling point of methanol is 149'F./and that of
      ethanol is 173°F./ The heated alcohol flows through conduit 36 to
      the vaporization chamber 40. Thermostat 53, which controls
      electric heating element 54, is adjusted to a temperature slightly
      greater than the boiling point of the alcohol used. When the
      alcohol reaches its boiling point, the light 55 illuminates to
      indicate that the engine may be started.<br>
      <br>
      The volume of alcohol vapor that flows from the vaporization
      chamber 40 and the intake manifold 58 can be manually controlled
      by the operator. As indicated, each thermostat is adjustable.
      Thus, the fuel system is capable of using alcohols with different
      boiling points. In addition, the system can adapt to ambient
      temperature changes and pressure changes due to variations in
      altitude. A thermostat adjustable within the range of 140.and
      220°F/is suitable for this purpose.<br>
      <br>
      When the engine reaches its normal operating temperature and the
      engine coolant is heated sufficiently, a thermostatic valve 94
      opens to allow the flow of heated engine coolant from the radiator
      96 through heat exchanger 16. The heated coolant supplements the
      electric heating element 42 to heat the alcohol fuel.<br>
      <br>
      The incoming air to the carburetor used in combustion is heated
      and humidified in the following manner. Tank 66 gravity feeds a
      solution of 5-50% alcohol in water to exhaust gas heat exchanger
      68.<br>
      <br>
      The exhaust gases passing through exhaust pipe 78 heat the
      alcohol-water solution to boiling. As the incoming air passes over
      the boiling solution, the air is heated and becomes saturated with
      alcohol and water. The humidified air passes through air outlet 76
      to the intake manifold 58 which is in communication with the
      cylinders of engine 26. The heated air aids in the vaporization of
      the alcohol fuel. The additional moisture creates steam in the
      engine cylinder which results in a higher internal pressure than
      in the case of a heated dry gas due to the steam:water volumetric
      expansion ratio of 1800:1. A dry gas, on the other hand, only
      expands in direct proportion to its absolute temperature.<br>
      <br>
      A suitable corrosion inhibitor may be added to the fuel system to
      inhibit the corrosive effects of the water present. Alternatively,
      suitable corrosion-resistant materials may be utilized in the
      fabrication of the system.<br>
      <br>
      As an additional advantage of the invention, greater expansive
      forces are realized upon combustion due to the presence of steam
      in the engine cylinders at elevated temperatures. The addition of
      water in the form of steam to the system may have the additional
      advantage of reducing the generation of emissions because the
      cooling effect of the condensed water lowers the combustion
      temperature thereby reducing nitrogen oxide production which is
      temperature- time dependent.<br>

      An alcohol/water fuel vaporizer for use in an internal combustion
      steam engine. The vaporizer comprises an exhaust gas chamber
      through which engine exhaust is passed and a vapor chamber for the
      generation and retention of pressurized fuel vapor. The exhaust
      gas chamber includes a plurality of baffles to direct the flow of
      the gas against a crown sheet, the latter sheet being heated
      thereby. The crown sheet forms the dividing partition between the
      vapor and exhaust gas chambers. A fuel preheater is positioned in
      the vapor chamber through which engine coolant is passed. A
      plurality of switchable fuel injectors in the vapor chamber
      controllably admit and spray fuel onto the preheater and crown
      plate in response to engine power demands and vapor chamber
      pressure.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The present invention relates generally to an internal combustion
      steam engine that operates with an alcohol fuel and, in
      particular, to an alcohol/water fuel system for supplying a
      vaporized fuel to the engine. Upon combustion, superheated steam
      is generated within the cylinders to produce an elevated pressure
      and temperature. More specifically, the present invention pertains
      to a unique combination of internal combustion and external burner
      steam technologies particularly adapted for recirculation of heat
      energy to produce a highly efficient engine adapted for
      automotive, farm, and other uses.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention is further directed to an improved vaporizer
      for use in connection with the above-described water/alcohol
      internal combustion steam engine. Such an engine was fully
      described in the prior U.S. Pat. No. 4,509,464 to the present
      inventor, Hansen. Therefore, the construction and operation of the
      engine itself will not be considered in detail herein except as it
      relates to the implementation of the present vaporizer.<br>
      <br>
      Indeed, the earlier '464 Hansen patent relates to improved
      vaporizer technology, specifically, to a dual-chamber vaporizer
      construction adapted to minimize the adverse effects of fractional
      distillation. The vaporizer of the '464 patent has been found to
      perform satisfactorily for alcohol/water fuels down to about 90
      proof, particularly where the fuel is of substantially pure
      quality, that is, uncontaminated by foreign solutes. In this
      connection, as water and alcohol are both excellent solvents,
      keeping the fuel free of solutes has proved to be a problem of
      non-trivial proportion.<br>
      <br>
      This problem of solutes or fuel contamination has been found to be
      of substantial importance in connection with the commercial
      exploitation of internal combustion steam technology. Although
      high purity alcohol fuels are readily available, the cost of these
      fuels can range from twice to as much as ten times that of fuels
      produced under less exacting and controlled conditions.<br>
      <br>
      The impact of the solutes problem is further accentuated when it
      is realized that many of the potential users of the alcohol-based
      internal combustion steam engine, e.g. farmers, are persons who
      have ample access to the recyclable waste or home-produced
      agricultural base stock from which alcohol may be produced. Such
      consumers, therefore, can be expected to manufacture fuel for
      their consumption as well as others in their locale. Fuels from
      such indigenous and varied sources characteristically contain
      higher impurity concentrations.<br>
      <br>
      Even where uncontaminated fuel is available, the problems of
      fractional distillation again surface when operating with fuels of
      super-low proofage, i.e. generally below about 90 proof. For such
      fuels, the residual affinity of the alcohol molecules (for water)
      is insufficient `to bring` or capture the increasingly greater
      proportion of water molecules as the alcohol is vaporized. This
      problem is particularly acute at lower vaporizer temperatures
      which, as noted below, have been found to track reductions in
      alcohol concentrations.<br>
      <br>
      It will be appreciated, therefore, that the improvements in
      vaporizer technology described herein are directed, first, to
      minimizing or totally eliminating the problems associated with
      fuel impurities and, second, to permitting the use of
      alcohol-based fuels of yet lower alcohol concentrations, for
      example 80 proof.<br>
      <br>
      Importantly, and directly associated with obtaining this latter
      objective, the present invention results in yet another
      improvement in the overall efficiency of the internal combustion
      steam engine. Efficiencies of approximately 60 percent are now
      obtainable which, in turn, result in typical fuel economies of
      between 20 and 40 miles per gallon of 80 proof alcohol-based
      fuel--such fuel being obtainable for as little as ten cents per
      gallon.<br>
      <br>
      The internal combustion steam engine described in the Hansen '464
      patent requires no radiator as the waste heat collected in the
      engine's liquid cooling system is routed to the fuel vaporizer
      where it is converted into useful energy in the processes of
      vaporizing the alcohol based fuel. In this manner, one significant
      source of engine inefficiency, the dissipation of engine heat by
      the radiator, has been largely eliminated.<br>
      <br>
      The Hansen '464 engine also reduced a second major source of
      engine inefficiency by converting the otherwise wasted exhaust gas
      heat energy into useful work by preheating the incoming carburetor
      combustion air.<br>
      <br>
      As noted, certain difficulties were experienced with the engine
      configuration of Hansen '464 as the proofage of the fuel was
      reduced, that is, as the ratio of water to alcohol was increased.
      More specifically, it has been found that the amount of waste
      engine heat available in the cooling system generally decreases as
      the fuel proofage is reduced.<br>
      <br>
      Coupled with this reduced waste heat generation is the
      counterproductive requirement that the fuel itself requires more
      heat energy to vaporize at these higher water concentrations--this
      by reason that water requires more energy per pound to vaporize
      than, for example, ethanol. Thus, even with the improved
      two-chamber vaporizer described in Hansen '464, fractional
      distillation was again found to be a problem for alcohol fuels of
      very low proofage.<br>
      <br>
      With respect to the second source of waste engine heat discussed
      above, it was discovered that the exhaust gas heat energy actually
      increases as the fuel proofage is lowered due, principally, to the
      increased steam content of the engine exhaust. The available
      exhaust gas heat energy significantly exceeds the combustion air
      preheat requirement.<br>
      <br>
      Unlike the vaporizer of Hansen '464, the present vaporizer has
      been substantially reconfigured to facilitate collection and
      conversion of waste heat energy from both the engine coolant and
      exhaust systems. In this manner the unused exhaust heat energy is
      meaningfully recycled thereby correcting inadequacies in vaporizer
      operation at lower proofages while, importantly, raising the
      overall efficiency of engine operation.<br>
      <br>
      The vaporizer preferably defines a generally enclosed rectangular
      volume having a form-factor adapted to fit into, and replace, the
      radiator of a conventional internal combustion gas engine. More
      specifically, the vaporizer comprises respective air-tight
      `exhaust gas` and `vapor` compartments and chambers vertically
      separated by a `crown sheet` barrier. The lower or exhaust gas
      chamber has inlet/outlet ports at opposed ends thereof and
      interior baffles whereby the flow of exhaust gas is routed through
      this lower chamber in proximity to the crown sheet--such sheet
      defining a shared common wall between the two chambers.<br>
      <br>
      Particularly significant to the performance of the present
      vaporizer (especially where low proofage and contaminated fuels
      are used) is its efficacious utilization of the excess exhaust gas
      energy. These exhaust gases are employed, not merely as a
      supplemental source of heat energy, but as an energy source at
      substantially greater temperature, typically between 500 DEG-600
      DEG F., than available using the engine coolant approach of Hansen
      '464.<br>
      <br>
      The vaporizer crown sheet is heated by passage of the exhaust
      gases to substantially the temperature of the gas itself. As
      discussed in more detail hereinafter, vaporization is achieved
      herein by spraying liquid fuel onto the crown sheet which, as
      noted, has been raised to a temperature several hundred degrees
      above the vaporization temperature of either water or alcohol
      (ethanol). It will be appreciated, therefore, that the fuel
      instantaneously vaporizes upon contacting the crown sheet without
      regard to the proofage or solutes contained therein.<br>
      <br>
      The upper vaporization region of the Hansen '464 vaporizer, by
      contrast, receives the engine coolant at its hottest temperature,
      typically 260 DEG F.--well above the 212 DEG F. vaporization
      temperature of the hardest-to-vaporize fuel constituent, water.
      For this reason, the Hansen '464 vaporizer operated well.<br>
      <br>
      Problems with this prior art vaporizer, however, are found where
      engine operations are attempted with alcohol fuel concentrations
      below about 90 proof. As previously noted, such operation is
      associated with a corresponding reduction in the available coolant
      system heat energy resulting, in turn, in lowered coolant
      temperatures. As coolant temperatures approach the vaporization
      temperature of water, fractional distillation is again seen.<br>
      <br>
      The present vaporizer does not, however, sacrifice the efficiency
      advantages achieved through the recycling of waste engine heat. In
      conformity with the teachings of Hansen '464, no radiator is
      employed. Instead, a network of copper tubes defining a fuel
      preheating heat exchanger is positioned in the vapor chamber above
      the crown sheet through which the engine coolant is passed. Fuel
      is sprayed onto this heat exchanger which, in turn, lowers the
      coolant temperature and heats and/or vaporizes the fuel. The
      unvaporized fuel thereafter contacts the crown sheet where
      complete vaporization is assured.<br>
      <br>
      A further advantage of the present vaporizer relates to its
      ability to handle the wide fuel vaporization demands associated
      with corresponding engine load changes. It will be appreciated
      that substantially greater vaporization is required for high
      vehicle speeds or uphill travel as compared with idle or low speed
      operations.<br>
      <br>
      Accommodation of these ranging load demands is achieved through
      the use of a plurality of spray nozzles or injectors in the vapor
      chamber, each injector being gated-on in response to predetermined
      vapor chamber pressures. Two injectors have been found to be
      sufficient for most applications.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, at vapor pressures in excess of about 3.5 psi all fuel spray
      injectors are off--the engine is operating from the residual
      volume of pressured fuel vapor in the vapor chamber and from any
      vapor being generated by the engine coolant heat exchanger. As the
      vapor pressure drops below about 2.5 psi, the first vapor spray
      injector is enabled. This injector, be placed in proximity to the
      hottest region of the crown sheet, ordinarily provides sufficient
      fuel vapor for continuing normal cruise vehicle operations. In
      fact, excess vaporization ordinarily will occur with this single
      injector resulting in the periodic shutting-off of the injector
      as, again, pressures in excess of 3.5 psi are achieved.<br>
      <br>
      At ever increasing engine/vehicle loads, the proportion of time
      that the injector is "on" increases until the point is reached
      where the injector must remain "on" continuously to maintain
      sufficient operational vapor pressure. Under extreme load
      conditions, the vapor pressure may continue to decrease,
      notwithstanding that this first injector remains on continuously,
      thereby necessitating use of the second or auxiliary spray
      injector. This injector, like the first injector, is pressure
      controlled, being enabled when vapor chamber pressures drop below
      about 1.5 psi.<br>
      <br>
      Advantageously the exhaust heat energy available to the vaporizer
      increases with increasing engine power loads thereby providing the
      necessary energy to vaporize the correspondingly increased fuel
      requirements. Crown plate temperatures remain relatively constant
      with changing engine loads. As a consequence, highly efficient
      vaporization is realized under all load conditions.<br>
      <br>
      And yet a further feature of the present vaporizer relates to the
      highly effective sound muffling characteristics associated with
      engine combustion. More specifically, the exhaust gas emitted by
      the present engine, particularly where low proofage fuel is used
      (e.g. 80 proof) contains a substantial percentage of superheated
      steam (e.g. 40%) at temperatures of between 500 DEG-600 DEG F. As
      the exhaust gas passes through the vaporizer, it is significantly
      cooled--exiting the vaporizer at temperatures around 200 DEG F.
      This cooling results in significant condensation and a
      corresponding drop in pressure.<br>
      <br>
      As a consequence, "noise" pressure waves are substantially
      attenuated as the exhaust transits the vapor chamber thereby
      eliminating or significantly reducing the need for a separate
      noise reduction system. And due to the inherently pure,
      nonpolluting character of the internal combustion steam engine,
      mufflers and catalytic converters may be entirely avoided.<br>
      <br>
      From the foregoing it will be appreciated that the vaporizer of
      the present invention exhibits startling improvements in a number
      of important categories critical to internal combustion steam
      engine operation. These improvements include full and complete
      vaporization, i.e. the elimination of fractional distillation,
      under widely varying engine load conditions and where impure and
      low proofage fuels are employed; the increase in engine efficiency
      by more effectively recycling engine waste energies; the
      elimination or reduction in the requirement for engine muffler
      systems; and control over the quantity of vapor production under
      extreme load variations.<br>

      </b><b>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</b><br>
      <br>
      Referring to FIGS. 1 and 2, the vaporizer 10 of the present
      invention comprises an outer housing 12 preferably of an overall
      size configuration to facilitate placement in the engine
      compartment in the space otherwise generally occupied by the
      radiator of a conventional automobile.<br>
      <br>
      In this connection it should be understood that the internal
      combustion steam engine, for example as described by Hansen in
      U.S. Pat. No. 4,509,464, may advantageously be constructed using
      conventional internal combustion gas engine blocks and
      cylinder/piston assemblies or alternatively, simply by converting
      the fuel, cooling, and exhaust systems of such readily available
      engines. Thus, the engine technology of the present application,
      and in particular the vaporizer described herein, finds
      significant if not principal application in the conversion of
      existing gas engine vehicles.<br>
      <br>
      It is for this reason that the present vaporizer 10 is preferably
      configured in size to replace conventional radiators. It will be
      understood, however, that alternative vaporizer configurations are
      contemplated.<br>
      <br>
      Referring again to FIGS. 1 and 2, housing 12 defines a pair of
      pressure-tight chambers separated by, and sharing a common
      dividing wall, referred to herein as crown sheet 14. The lower or
      exhaust gas chamber 16 extends along the full bottom width of the
      vaporizer and has an exhaust gas inlet 18 and outlet 20 spaced at
      respective opposed ends thereof. Engine exhaust is routed through
      the carburetor (not shown) to heat the incoming combustion air (as
      described in Hansen '464), thereafter to vaporizer inlet 18,
      through chamber 16 and outlet 18, in turn, being expelled to the
      ambient air through a conventional exhaust pipe (not shown).<br>
      <br>
      More than sufficient energy is available from the engine exhaust,
      even after heating the incoming combustion air, to aid in the
      proper vaporization of the alcohol-based fuel. This is
      particularly true in connection with engines operated from low
      proofage alcohol fuels, e.g. below about 90 proof, where the
      superheated steam content of the exhaust, with its corresponding
      latent heat energy, is high. Indeed, exhaust gas temperatures at
      the inlet 18 of the vaporizer are typically in the order of
      between 500 DEG and 600 DEG F.<br>
      <br>
      One or more baffles 22 are placed transversely across the exhaust
      gas chamber to create exhaust gas turbulence and to force the
      exhaust gas into proximity with the crown sheet 14 (transverse
      being defined relative to the path of exhaust gas flow therein,
      i.e. transverse to the path from inlet 18 to outlet 20). The
      baffles defines apertures 24 along the upper ends thereof forcing
      the exhaust gas to transit through the chamber in close proximity
      to the crown sheet. In this manner the proper transfer of heat
      energy from the exhaust gas to the crown sheet may be assured.<br>
      <br>
      In one embodiment of the vaporizer the exhaust chamber is
      approximately 22" in length, 2" in height, and 4" in width, with
      respective exhaust gas inlets/outlets 16,18 spaced approximately
      16" apart. The baffle apertures 24 are 1/4" high and, as noted,
      extend along the entire chamber width.<br>
      <br>
      Due to this close association or passage of the exhaust gas to the
      crown sheet, the crown sheet is heated substantially to the
      temperature of the exhaust gas, that is, to about 500 DEG-600 DEG
      F. in the region of inlet 18. As the exhaust passes through
      chamber 16, however, heat energy is extracted from the exhaust
      gas, being absorbed by the crown sheet, thereby resulting in the
      lowering of the exhaust gas temperature as it passes through this
      chamber. Exhaust gas temperatures as low as 200 DEG F. may be seen
      at outlet 18. The temperature of the crown sheet 14 exhibits a
      corresponding decrease in temperature along its length.<br>
      <br>
      The interior of outer vaporizer housing 12 above the crown sheet
      defines a vapor chamber 26. Vaporized alcohol/water fuel is
      maintained, as set forth hereinafter, at a pressure of between
      about 1 and 5 psi within the vapor chamber and supplied to the
      carburetor (not shown) according to the power demands placed on
      the engine. Vapor chamber outlet 28 interconnects to the vapor
      fuel inlet of the carburetor<br>
      <br>
      As best illustrated in FIG. 3, a fuel preheater 30 is positioned
      in the lower portion of the vapor chamber generally adjacent to
      the crown sheet, but spaced therefrom a sufficient distance (i.e.
      about 1/8 inch) to minimize or preclude conductive heating of the
      preheater 30 by the exhaust-heated crown sheet.<br>
      <br>
      Preheater 30 includes a plurality of spaced, generally parallel,
      copper tubes 32 extending lengthwise along the vaporizer, each
      tube being in fluid communication at its respective distal ends
      with a cooling fluid inlet 34 and outlet 36. In the fuel preheater
      illustrated in FIG. 3, copper tubes of 1/4" diameter are spaced
      approximately 1/16" apart across substantially the full 4"
      vaporizer width.<br>
      <br>
      Coolant from the conventional engine liquid cooling system is
      routed to vaporizer preheater inlet 34, through the plural copper
      tubes therein, in turn, returned to the engine through outlet 36.
      In the preferred arrangement, fuel preheater 30 functions not
      merely in its fuel preheating capacity, but as a replacement for
      the conventional engine coolant radiator.<br>
      <br>
      Fuel is introduced into vaporizer 10 through one or more spray
      nozzles or fuel injectors. It has been found that two injectors
      are generally sufficient to accommodate the varying loads
      encountered by most engine-driven vehicles. It will be
      appreciated, however, that single injector vaporizers, or
      vaporizers employing more than two injectors are contemplated
      herein.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, the vaporizer of FIGS. 1 and 2 illustrates the use of two
      injectors. The first or primary injector 38 is positioned in
      closest proximity to the exhaust gas inlet 18. In this manner the
      fuel from this injector is exposed to the hottest regions of both
      the preheater 30 and crown plate 14 thereby assuring the maximum
      vaporization effectiveness with respect thereto. A second or
      auxiliary injector 40 is positioned along the preheater/crown
      sheet generally adjacent to primary injector 38.<br>
      <br>
      More specifically, both injectors are oriented above preheater 30
      such that the respective sprays therefrom define generally
      circular patterns of about 4" diameter. In this manner fuel is
      directed across the full corresponding width of preheater 30.
      Primary injector 38 may be located inwardly from exhaust gas inlet
      18 approximately 5" to assure exposure of the fuel therefrom to
      the hottest regions of the preheater and crown sheet. The
      auxiliary injector 40 is preferably positioned 6" closer to
      exhaust gas outlet 20 such that the spray therefrom contacts a
      virgin region of the preheater/crown sheet, that is, so the
      respective spray patterns do not overlap.<br>
      <br>
      As best shown in FIG. 1, the spray from the respective injectors
      38,40 is directed downwardly against the copper tubes 32 of
      preheater 30. This spray or fuel mist 42 acts, by reason of its
      ambient, i.e. intrinsically cool, temperature, to correspondingly
      lower the temperature of the engine coolant passing through
      preheater 30--the engine coolant typically entering the preheater
      at temperatures well-above ambient, often in the order of 250 DEG
      F. It will be understood that this exchange of otherwise wasted
      engine heat energy serves, not merely to maintain proper engine
      operating temperatures, but as a mechanism to raise the
      temperature of the incoming combustion fuel mixture.<br>
      <br>
      The energy content and absolute temperature of the engine coolant
      entering the vaporizer may be insufficient to vaporize the
      required combustion fuel, and to do so without fractional
      distillation, the latter resulting in excessively rich vapor
      concentrations followed by the inevitably lean fuel mixtures
      associated with the premature vaporization of the alcohol
      constituent. As noted, these difficulties become more debilitating
      where low proofage or contaminated fuels are used.<br>
      <br>
      The present vaporizer solves this energy shortfall by
      efficaciously converting excess exhaust gas energy to the
      vaporization task. This use of a second source of energy is
      extremely important as, at lower fuel proofages, the margin of
      available exhaust gas energy, over that required to heat the
      incoming combustion air, is increasing.<br>
      <br>
      In short, a significant by-product of the internal combustion
      steam engine would be expelled as waste heat but for the
      innovations herein disclosed. The tapping of this heretofore
      unused energy source translates and corresponds directly to
      improved engine efficiencies--efficiencies which now render the
      present alcohol-based engine competitive, on a miles per fuel
      gallon basis, with the higher specific heat (per volume)
      hydrocarbon fuels, i.e. gasoline.<br>
      <br>
      In addition to this increase in engine efficiency afforded by the
      present invention is the, possibly more subtle but equally
      significant, improvement in vaporizer efficacy occasioned by
      utilization of the exhaust gas energy source--a source available
      at substantially elevated temperatures, generally in the order
      between 500 DEG-600 DEG F.<br>
      <br>
      Referring again to FIG. 1, it will be seen that the fuel mist 42
      from injectors 38,40 is sprayed either directly onto the crown
      sheet 14 or indirectly thereon after first contacting and
      preheater 30. The advantage of this arrangement is that all fuel,
      regardless of the water concentration or its solute content,
      immediately flashes into the vapor state upon contact with the
      superheated crown sheet.<br>
      <br>
      Fuel to each of the injectors 38,40 is independently controlled,
      i.e. turned "on" or "off", by individual valves that are
      separately and electrically actuated in response to the sensed
      pressure within the vapor chamber 26. Specifically, primary valve
      44 is positioned in the primary injector 38 fuel supply line and
      is actuated by switch 46. Switch 46 is mounted to and extends
      through the vaporizer housing and is responsive to pressure
      changes within the vapor chamber. Switch 46 is selected to enable
      valve 44, i.e. to turn-on the spray of fuel from primary injector
      38, when the vapor chamber pressure falls below about 2.5 psi and
      to turn such injector "off" when the pressure therein exceeds
      about 3.5 psi.<br>
      <br>
      Similarly fuel to the auxiliary injector 40 is controlled by an
      auxiliary valve 48 and pressure switch 50 combination. The
      pressure settings of switch 50, however, are set to trigger
      auxiliary injector operation only when vapor chamber pressures
      drop below normal operational levels. Thus, the auxiliary injector
      spray will be triggered should vapor chamber pressures fall below
      about 1.5 psi and this spray will remain "on" until chamber
      pressures recover to about 2.5 psi.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 4 is illustrative of vaporizer operation, specifically the
      fuel vapor pressure within the vapor chamber 26, under varying
      vehicle/engine load conditions. Referring first to the solid trace
      line 52, there is depicted typical fuel vapor pressures where the
      vehicle is operated under a "low cruise" condition, that is, at a
      constant low to moderate speed, on level terrain.<br>
      <br>
      For purposes of illustration, each of the operational curves of
      FIG. 4 assumes an initial vapor chamber pressure of 4 psi. Such
      increased chamber pressures would not be unanticipated under
      certain operating conditions, for example, where the engine has
      been reduced to idle following a period of higher power operation.<br>
      <br>
      At time "zero", the high vaporizer pressure results in both
      injectors being disabled, i.e. turned "off", such that no
      additional fuel is being admitted to the vapor chamber. Under
      sustained low-cruise power settings (again, as shown by trace 52),
      the residual vaporized fuel within the vapor chamber is adequate
      to sustain engine operation for a short duration, e.g. 1-2
      seconds, without the introduction of additional fuel into the
      chamber. The vapor pressure, however, drops steadily until the 2.5
      psi trigger threshold, at 54, of the primary pressure switch 46 is
      reached.<br>
      <br>
      At this instant, fuel from injector 38 is sprayed onto both the
      preheater 30 and crown sheet 14 in the respective hottest regions
      thereof. In the case of the crown sheet, temperatures of 500
      DEG-600 DEG F. are not uncommon. As a consequence, complete and
      instantaneous vaporization of that fuel is achieved.<br>
      <br>
      The volume of fuel entering the vaporizer through injector 38,
      coupled with the heat capacity of the vaporizer, produces more
      vaporized fuel than is demanded by the engine carburetor (not
      shown) during low-cruise vehicle operations. Thus, the excess
      vaporized fuel results in increasing vapor chamber pressures which
      continue to climb until the 3.5 psi turn-off threshold of switch
      46 is reached, shown at 56. At this juncture, the primary injector
      is switched off and, as no fuel is being injected into the vapor
      chamber, the vapor pressure declines until the pressure again
      reaches the 2.5 psi trigger pressure of switch 46, shown at 58.
      The primary injector 38 is thusly cycled to produce and maintain
      the required vapor production.<br>
      <br>
      It will be observed that, during operation at the abovedescribed
      low-cruise power level, vapor chamber pressures remain constantly
      above the 1.5 psi trigger threshold of the auxiliary injector
      switch 50 and, consequently, operation at these lower power levels
      may be sustained without actuation of such auxiliary injector.<br>
      <br>
      The dotted line trace 60 of FIG. 4 similarly illustrates vehicle
      operation, but under somewhat greater engine power demands, for
      example, under sustained high-cruise level terrain vehicle travel.
      Under such conditions, the consumption of fuel vapor increases
      resulting in the correspondingly sharper negative slope of the
      depicted vapor pressure curve during periods where fuel injector
      38 is off, and, less rapid recoveries of vapor chamber pressuring
      during injector "on" periods.<br>
      <br>
      It will be understood that by continuing to increase the engine
      power level, with its corresponding increased fuel vapor
      requirement, a point of equilibrium may be reached where the
      production of vaporized fuel from the primary injector 38, alone,
      is just sufficient to meet engine fuel demands. This condition is
      shown by line trace 62 of FIG. 4.<br>
      <br>
      If the engine power requirements are increased beyond this level,
      for example for extreme vehicle speeds, for towing heavy loads, or
      for steep up-grade travel, fuel vapor production from the single
      injector 38 may be insufficient. As shown by the line trace 64,
      vapor chamber pressure, under such extreme load conditions,
      continues to decrease even following actuation of the primary
      injector 38 which occurs, shown at 66, when the pressure drops to
      2.5 psi. Actuation of the primary injector slows the rate of vapor
      pressure loss but, as noted, does not arrest its downward trend.<br>
      <br>
      As the vapor chamber pressure continues to drop, the 1.5 psi
      trigger threshold of auxiliary pressure switch 50 is reached, at
      68, which, in turn, enables the corresponding auxiliary injector
      40. The vapor generated by these combined injectors is sufficient
      to provide the vaporized fuel requirements of the engine even when
      operated under sustained full power conditions. Thus, vapor
      chamber pressure increases until the 2.5 psi shut-down threshold
      of the auxiliary switch is reached, at 70. Upon the closing of
      auxiliary valve 48, chamber pressure again declines. Full or high
      engine power operations are, therefore maintained in this manner
      by cycling the auxiliary injector 40 while the primary injector 38
      remains continuously enabled.<br>
      <br>
      It will be appreciated that the use of multiple injectors and the
      use of injectors having fully controllable duty cycles provides a
      vaporizer having enhanced flexibility to handle the widely varying
      engine load requirements, from idle to full power. Furthermore,
      employment of the engine coolant fuel preheater provides an
      effective means for maintaining proper engine operating
      temperatures while simultaneously facilitating the recovery of
      otherwise lost engine heat energy. This energy source, coupled
      with the incorporation of an exhaust gas chamber, with its high
      capacity, temperature heat exchange capability, further
      contributes to the present invention, its improved vaporization
      consistency in the face of varying quality and proofage fuels, and
      its complementary attributes contributing to overall high engine
      fuel efficiencies<br>
      <br>
      A further contribution of the present vaporizer pertains to its
      intrinsic noise attenuating capacity. Passage of the exhaust gas,
      which gas contains a high content of superheated steam, through
      the exhaust gas chamber results in the effective attenuation of a
      large proportion of the ordinary engine combustion noise. Use of
      the present vaporizer, therefore, obviates the requirement for any
      further muffling system in most ordinary vehicular applications.<br>

      <br>
      An internal combustion steam engine is operated with an
      alcohol-water fuel mixture vaporized prior to combustion by heated
      engine coolant that flows through a first heat exchanger. The
      first heat exchanger or vapor generator uses the waste heat from
      the engine coolant to heat and vaporize the alcohol-water mixture.
      A second heat exchanger using exhaust gases heats the combustion
      air before passage through the intake manifold. Complete
      vaporization of the alcohol fuel is accomplished to overcome the
      lower caloric power potential of alcohol as compared to gasoline
      and to insure complete and regular combustion.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      The present invention relates generally to an internal combustion
      steam engine that operates with an alcohol fuel and, in
      particular, to an alcohol-water fuel system for supplying a
      vaporizing fuel to the engine. Upon combustion, superheated steam
      is generated within the cylinders to produce an elevated pressure
      and temperature. More specifically, the present invention pertains
      to a unique combination of internal combustion and external burner
      steam technologies particularly adapted for the recirculation of
      heat energy to produce a highly efficient engine adapted for
      automotive and other uses.<br>
      <br>
      Conventional gasoline engines operate on what is known as the OTTO
      cycle wherein a carbureted mixture of fuel and air is ignited
      following compression in the well known manner and, thereafter,
      expelled to the surroundings through an exhaust manifold and
      muffler system. Such engines, however, exhibit substantial losses
      of heat and other energy which, in turn, results in poor fuel to
      mechanical work energy conversion. First, the burning gases
      produce a mean effective pressure in the cylinder of about 100-200
      psi but at an extremely elevated temperature of typically 3000 DEG
      F. This excessive heat, which is generally dissipated through an
      engine radiator to avoid cylinder and piston destruction, accounts
      for an approximate 35 percent loss in the BTU energy of unburned
      gasoline fuel.<br>
      <br>
      Further, it is known that proper stoichiometric mixtures for
      complete fuel burning do not ignite readily and, therefore,
      excessive fuel (i.e. rich mixture) is generally provided. This, in
      turn, results in partial or unburned carbon exhaust products
      contributing to environmental pollution and further losses in
      efficiency. As an alternative, conventional fuel injection systems
      may be employed to directly inject fuel droplets into the
      airstream. Although more efficient than conventional carburetors,
      the injection of relatively large droplets, typically 0.050 inches
      in diameter, still results in incomplete combustion.<br>
      <br>
      In addition to the above described unburned fuel and coolant
      energy losses, the exhaust gases are quite hot, often in excess of
      1500 DEG F., thereby adding further to the heat energy loss.
      Indeed, it is common to see exhaust manifolds heated to glowing,
      and flames emitted from the exhaust pipe are not uncommon. In
      total, these exhaust related losses account for another 35 percent
      of the total gasoline fuel energy. Deducting yet another 10
      percent for frictional losses, the overall efficiency of a typical
      internal combustion gasoline engine is in the order of about 20
      percent.<br>
      <br>
      In sharp contrast to the elevated operating temperatures of
      gasoline fueled internal combustion engines, a typical external
      combustion steam engine operates at temperatures between about 440
      DEG F. and 470 DEG F. corresponding to steam pressures between
      about 400 psi and 500 psi. Thus, a conventional external
      combustion steam engine produces the requisite cylinder pressure
      but at a greatly reduced operating temperature which, in turn,
      significantly lessens engine cooling and exhaust heat losses.<br>
      <br>
      Conventional external combustion steam engines, however, have
      several dissadvantages which render them unsuitable for use in
      modern automobiles. First, a relatively bulky boiler is required
      to generate the steam. In addition, significant time is required
      to heat the boiler to operating pressures which delays productive
      use of the engine upon initial start-up and, during low load
      periods, renders the system relatively more inefficient.<br>
      <br>
      Conventional external combustion steam engines are, in any event,
      rather inefficient. These engines, which operate on the RANKINE
      cycle, require the burning of fuel to heat and vaporize water
      contained within a boiler. The resulting steam passes through
      necessary piping and controls and, in turn, is admitted to engine
      cylinder. Assuming that the boiler water is initially at 32 DEG
      F., 180 BTU per pound must be added to raise the water to the 212
      DEG F. boiling point and an additional 1030 BTU to convert the
      water to the steam phase at 500 psi. Assuming, further, that a
      typical steam engine exhausts the steam at as little as 20 psi, an
      overall engine efficiency of 4 percent results. Even this low
      efficiency figure is optimistic as other losses including boiler
      efficiency were not considered.<br>
      <br>
      The present internal combustion steam engine, by contrast,
      represents a highly efficient combination of steam and internal
      combustion technologies particularly suited to the reclamation of
      otherwise lost heat energies. First, the energy in the engine
      cooling system is recycled to vaporize the water-alcohol fuel
      mixture. This vaporized fuel burns more rapidly thereby producing
      the maximum pressure in the cylinder and the highest mean
      effective pressure. The water enters the cylinder as a vapor with
      an enthalpy already at 1150 BTU per pound requiring only an
      additional 50 BTU to raise its pressure, as in the steam engine
      example above, to 500 psi. Assuming, again, an exhaust pressure of
      20 psi and substantially complete recirculation of the coolant
      energy (actually, a few percent recirculation loss is typical), a
      thermal efficiency of about 88 percent results.<br>
      <br>
      Further, since substantially all the fuel of the present invention
      is burned, there is correspondingly little lost fuel energy and
      minimal environmental pollution. To further improve the efficiency
      of the present engine, the exhaust gases may advantageously be
      recirculated to preheat the carburetor inlet air to approximately
      500 DEG F. thereby further reducing the heat which must be
      subsequently added or generated in the steam combustion cylinder
      cycle. In this manner, the exhaust losses are reduced to about 15
      percent. Considering frictional losses, an overall efficiency of
      slightly more than 50 percent may be achieved. This is about three
      times the efficiency of a conventional gasoline internal
      combustion engine, about twice that of a diesel, and over ten
      times as efficient as a steam engine.<br>
      <br>
      A further advantage of the present engine is that it may be
      operated with many differing fuels including most alcohols. This
      includes a variety of hydroxyl derivatives of hydrocarbons such as
      methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, tertiary butanol and mixtures
      thereof with water. The preferred fuel is ethanol which can
      advantageously be made inexpensively from organic waste. In
      addition, ethanol will support combustion when mixed with water
      even at low concentrations. This heat of combustion turns the
      water into, or superheats, the steam.<br>
      <br>
      Internal combustion engines operated with alcohol or a blended
      gasoline-alcohol mixture are well known. Such blending, however,
      lowers the boiling point of the gasoline and thereby causes vapor
      lock in the fuel pump at a lower temperature than would be the
      case with pure gasoline. In addition, the introduction of water to
      a blended gasoline-alcohol fuel mixture causes the mixture to
      separate into its constituent phases. Since the resultant fuel
      supplied to the carburetor is not of constant composition and does
      not correspond to the composition to which the carburetor was
      initially adjusted, the engine malfunctions.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      According to the present invention, an alcohol-water fuel is
      pumped from a fuel reservoir into a first heat exchanger or vapor
      generator where the waste heat from the engine cooling system
      vaporizes the fuel. The fuel then passes through suitable valves,
      controls and a vapor carburetor before entering the engine
      cylinders. The alcohol burns in the cylinders turning the water
      vapor into superheated steam. A high alcohol content results in
      high pressure and temperature. The reverse is also true. Alcohol
      of 125 to 140 proof gives engine performance superior to gasoline
      fuel with lower proofages, down to about 90 proof, performing
      quite substantially. A higher proof alcohol is needed in cold
      weather when the passenger compartment of the vehicle must be
      heated, because engine heat losses are greater in cold weather.<br>
      <br>
      In one embodiment of the present invention, an electrical means is
      provided in a first heat exchanger to heat and vaporize the
      alcohol fuel prior to ignition and thus avoid the cold starting
      problems associated with the use of alcohol as fuel. According to
      a second embodiment, warmed engine coolant is circulated through
      the first exchanger similarly vaporizing the alcohol fuel. The
      unique two-stage heat exchanger, having an upper first stage hot
      plate, is particularly suited to the vaporization of low proofage
      fuels while minimizing fractional distillation. In addition, means
      are provided to heat the combustion air in a second heat exchanger
      priot to combustion using thermal energy of the hot exhaust gases
      generated by the engine under normal operating conditions.<br>
      <br>
      According to the present invention, the alcohol-water mixture is
      conveyed to the first heat exchanger, and heat is transferred from
      the electric heating element or the heated engine coolant to the
      water-alcohol. In the first heat exchanger the alcohol-water fuel
      is vaporized. The alcohol and water vapors produced are then
      passed to the intake manifold of the engine. All components of the
      fuel system through which the heated fuel and the vapors flow are
      insulated to minimize heat loss.<br>
      <br>
      A second heat exchanger located on the exhaust lines heats the
      combustion air which also flows to the intake manifold. As a
      result, the temperature of the air passing to the intake manifold
      is increased, and the vapors generated in the first heat exchanger
      are maintained in a gaseous state prior to combustion.<br>
      <br>
      It is an object of this invention to increase the efficiency of an
      alcohol operated internal combustion engine by providing means for
      vaporizing an alcohol-water fuel and means for heating and
      humidifying the air used in combustion.<br>
      <br>
      It is a further object of this invention to provide a means for
      overcoming the cold starting problem of an internal combustion
      engine operated with alcohol as fuel.<br>
      <br>
      Other objects and advantages will be apparent from the following

      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      Referring to FIG. 1, the fuel is stored in a reservoir 10 and is
      withdrawn therefrom through a conduit 12 under pressure produced
      by a fuel pump 14. As previously described, the fuel is an
      alcohol-water mixture, the preferred alcohol being ethanol.<br>
      <br>
      The fuel flows through a conduit 16 to a vapor generator 18, which
      is essentially a heat exchanger, at a pressure of approximately
      two pounds per square inch. The vapor generator 18, more clearly
      shown in FIGS. 2 and 3, is a hollow container or cylinder 20
      having a liquid coolant inlet 22 and outlet 24 in addition to a
      fuel inlet 26 and outlet 28.<br>
      <br>
      Positioned within the container 20 is a heater core 30 through
      which engine coolant can circulate. Specifically, liquid coolant
      from the internal combustion engine 32 is circulated by a water
      pump 34 through a hose 36 to the coolant inlet 22. The coolant
      then circulates through the heater core 30 and, after passing
      through the coolant outlet 24, returns to the engine 32 through a
      hose 38.<br>
      <br>
      An elongated, rod-like electric heating element 40 is located
      within the continer 20, the heating element 40 being immersed
      within the fuel which surrounds the heater core 30. The electric
      heating element 40, which is operated by a power supply 42 (for
      example, the vehicle's battery), supplements the heat from the
      engine coolant to overcome the cold starting difficulties
      associated with the use of alcohol fuel. A thermostat 44
      positioned between the vapor generator 18 and the vapor carburetor
      47 of the engine controls the heating element 40 and a ready light
      48, which indicates that the circuit is operating. The alcohol and
      water vapors flow through the fuel outlet 28 to a conduit 50 in
      communication with a demand valve 49 connected to the vapor
      carburetor 47. The carburetor 47, in turn, is connected to the
      intake manifold 46 of the engine.<br>
      <br>
      A pressure relief valve 54 which is set, for example, at four
      pounds pressure can be used as a safety device to prevent the
      buildup of excess pressure within the container 20. The liquid
      fuel level in the container 20 is regulated by a valve 56 and a
      float 58 associated with the fuel inlet 26.<br>
      <br>
      In operation, the fuel pump 14 fills the vapor generator 18 with
      fuel to a level about one inch below the top of the heater core
      30. This serves the purpose superheating the vapor and channeling
      all the liquid to be vaporized by the submerged heating element
      40. With alcohol proofage at 140 or below there is a tendency for
      fractional distillation to occur when the engine coolant is being
      heated to the operating temperature. As the temperature passes 175
      DEG F., the alcohol would be distilled leaving the water behind.
      This can create an imbalance in the air-fuel ratio. Later as the
      engine reaches operating temperature, the remaining water would be
      vaporized. Thus, the vapor would first be too rich and then too
      lean. The heating element 40 and the channeling of the liquid
      along the sides of the heater core 30 solves this problem.<br>
      <br>
      A pressure relief valve such as valve 54, is required by law on
      all pressure vessels. It can be connected to a hose (not shown) to
      vent back to the fuel reservoir so no fuel is lost and most of the
      heat is recovered. Normally the valve will not be used. If the
      valve should start venting, it indicates too high a proofage of
      fuel is used. Lower proofage produces a lower operating
      temperature.<br>
      <br>
      The heating element 40 activated by a pressure switch 59 is on
      when the pressure within the container 20 is less than three
      pounds per square inch. Thus, the heating element operates when
      starting from a cold start. In severely cold weather, when heat is
      needed for the car and heat loss is substantial, the heating
      element will operate continuously.<br>
      <br>
      In practice, the heat of combustion produced as the ethanol water
      fuel is burned raises the temperature and pressure of the vapor
      from 212 DEG F. and 14.7 psi to superheated steam at 500 psi and
      600 DEG F. by only adding 148 btu per pound of vapor. If the
      typical boiler arrangement is used, 1270 btu would be required.
      The expanding steam moves the piston to produce useful work. In a
      preferred embodiment exhaust gas temperature and pressure are 280
      DEG F. and 50 psi, respectively, with a heat content or enthalpy
      of 1174 btu.<br>
      <br>
      The flash point of ethanol is 70 DEG F. This means that ethanol
      will not ignite at a temperature less than 70 DEG F. This is a
      safety feature in the event of an accident. The flash points,
      however, also present a problem in ignition because most of the
      time the ambient temperature of the fuel mixture is below the
      flash point. By vaporizing the fuel, the ignition problem is
      solved except for the fact that if the engine is cold, the vapor
      will cool and condense below the flash point.<br>
      <br>
      As a solution to that problem, propane can be used as a starting
      fuel. A small tank (not shown) with a pressure reducing valve and
      a vaporizing valve furnishes propane vapor to the vapor generator
      at one pound pressure. As long as the alcohol-water vapor pressure
      is less than one pound, the propane is admitted. When the pressure
      rises above that, the propane will no longer flow. By this time,
      however, the engine is at operating temperature, and the
      carburetor air is above the minimum of 212 DEG F.<br>
      <br>
      Propane was selected as the auxiliary starting fuel because it is
      compatible with alcohol and water. It can be heated in the vapor
      generator to heat the elements of the vapor line and prevent
      condensation when the alcohol and water vapor start to flow. The
      transition from one fuel to the other is gradual and does not
      impair the performance of the engine. The different air-fuel
      ration of combustion is automatically changed by a pressure
      control switch which energizes a solenoid valve.<br>
      <br>
      As further shown in FIG. 1 and illustrated in greater detail in
      FIG. 4, a second heat exchanger 60 comprises a chamber 62 divided
      into at least two adjacent compartments A and B by a partition 64,
      which extends from the top to the bottom of the chamber and from
      one side substantially to the other side of the chamber.<br>
      <br>
      The exhaust manifold 66 of the engine is connected by exhaust pipe
      68 to an exhaust gas inlet 70 in one of the compartments (for
      example, compartment A). A heat transfer tube 72, which has a
      large circumference relative to the exhaust pipe 68, extends
      within the chamber along the face of the partition 64 defining
      compartment A, into compartment B, and to an exhaust gas outlet 74
      which is in communication with the atmosphere.<br>
      <br>
      An air inlet 76 adjacent the exhaust gas outlet 74 in compartment
      B directs combustion air into the chamber 62 for flow through
      compartment B and compartment A to an air outlet 78, which is
      connected by a hose 80 to the vapor carburetor 47 of the engine.<br>
      <br>
      During operation of the engine, hot exhaust gases flow through the
      heat transfer tube 72 and compartments A and B of the second heat
      exchanger 60 to heat the combustion air flowing in the opposite
      direction through the heat exchanger. Because the heat transfer
      tube 72 has a relatively large circumference, the surface area of
      the tube 72 in contact with the surrounding combustion air is
      increased and maximum heat transfer is achieved between the
      exhaust gases flowing through the tube and the combustion air. In
      a second embodiment of the second heat exchanger 60, a plurality
      of heat transfer tubes can extend between compartments A and B.<br>
      <br>
      The heated combustion air passes through air outlet 78 to the hose
      80 connected to the vapor carburetor 47. Thereafter, the heated
      air flows to the intake manifold. As the heated combustion air
      combines with the alcohol and water vapors produced by the first
      heat exchanger 18, the air becomes saturated with alcohol and
      water. Likewise, the heated air aids in maintaining the vaporized
      state of the alcohol-water fuel.<br>
      <br>
      The moisture from the vaporized fuel creates steam in the engine
      cylinders which produces a higher internal pressure than in the
      case of a heated dry gas due to the steam-water volumetric
      expansion ratio of 1600:1. A dry gas, on the other hand, expands
      only in direct proportion to its absolute temperature. Thus,
      greater expansive forces are realized upon combustion due to the
      presence of steam in the engine cylinders at elevated
      temperatures. The addition of water in the form of steam to the
      system may also have the additional advantage of reducing the
      generation of emissions because the cooling effect of the
      condensed water lowers the combustion temperature thereby reducing
      nitrogen oxide production which is temperature-time dependent.<br>
      <br>
      The volume of alcohol vapor that flow from the vapor generator 20
      and the intake manifold 46 can be manually controlled by the
      operator. As indicated, the thermostat 44 is also adjustable.
      Thus, the fuel system is capable of using alcohols with different
      boiling points. In addition, the system can adapt to ambient
      temperature changes and pressure changes due to variations in
      altitude. A thermostat adjustable within the range of 140 DEG and
      220 DEG F. is suitable for use in this invention.<br>
      <br>
      In essence, the invention is an internal combustion steam engine
      because superheated steam is generated within the cylinder. The
      lower temperatures at the pressure involved as compared to
      gasoline fuel, produce a high efficiency and a substantial energy
      savings. The combustion characteristics of alcohol result in
      minimal pollution, less engine wear and a longer life for the
      unit.<br>
      <br>
      The lower cylinder temperatures also mean much less energy is
      transferred into the engine cooling system. Therefore, a large
      radiator that dissipates energy to the atmosphere is not required.
      Instead, a small unit immersed in the fuel in the vaporizer is
      adequate. Moreover, instead of releasing this energy, it is
      recycled to heat the fuel. Once the engine is at the operating
      temperature, the same energy can be recirculated between the fuel
      and the cooling system.<br>
      <br>
      A second embodiment of the vapor generator 18 of FIG. 1 is shown
      generally at 100 in FIGS. 5-7. This embodiment offers improved
      performance where the present engine is operated with low alcohol
      fuel proofages. Specifically, this alternative structure further
      reduces fractional distillation which becomes an increasing
      problem as the fuel proofage is reduced. Fractional distillation
      occurs due to the higher volatility and lower boiling point of
      alcohol as compared with water. More specifically, there exists a
      certain molecular affinity between the water and alcohol molecules
      which, at higher alcohol concentrations, limits the disassociation
      of these disparate molecules. However, as the alcohol
      concentration is lowered, the effects of molecular affinity are
      reduced with a corresponding tendency that alcohol, with its lower
      boiling point of 173 DEG F., will be evaporated more readily.<br>
      <br>
      This phenomenon, known as fractional distillation, results in a
      proportionately higher percentage of alcohol, than water,
      vaporization. Thus, fractional distillation increases the
      effective concentration of alcohol, initially, but ultimately
      results in lowered concentrations as the liquid fuel mixture that
      remains is comprised of an excessive proportion of water.<br>
      <br>
      Vapor generator 100 includes a hot plate 102 positioned directly
      above a finned heat exchanger 104, both of which are submerged
      beneath the alcohol fuel in a vaporizer shell 106. A liquid fuel
      inlet 108 is provided in the lower portion of shell 106 to admit
      fuel substantially at ambient temperature. A liquid level
      controller 110 is positioned in shell 106 immediately above heat
      exchanger 102. Controller 110 is operatively connected to a fuel
      pump 14, FIG. 1, thereby to maintain the vapor generator fuel
      level at a predetermined level above the hot plate. As will be
      explained in more detail below, the fuel is preferably maintained
      approximately 1/8 inch above the upper hot plate surface which may
      be contoured or include ridges or the like to dampen oscillatory
      fuel movement thereover.<br>
      <br>
      The hot plate is comprised of parallel heating tubes 112
      interconnecting opposed manifolds 114, 116 whereby engine coolant
      entering manifold 114 passes through the plural tubes 112 before
      exiting through manifold 116. Each manifold is provided with an
      appropriate liquid coolant inlet (outlet) 118 for interconnection
      with the engine cooling system and the heat exchanger 104 as
      considered below. Hot plate tubes 112 are preferably about--inches
      in diameter with approximately 1/16 inch separating adjacent
      tubes.<br>
      <br>
      Heat exchanger 104 may be of conventional finned design and
      includes inlets (outlets) 120 at the ends thereof. One of the heat
      exchanger inlets 120 is positioned substantially below, and is
      interconnected with, an outlet 118 from the hot plate. The
      remaining hot plate inlet 118 is connected to the coolant line
      from the engine, for example line 36 of FIG. 1. In similar
      fashion, the remaining inlet 120 of the heat exchanger is
      connected to the return coolnt line 38, FIG. 1. Thus, hot plate
      102 and heat exchanger 104 are series-configured such that the
      hottest coolant directly from the engine passes through the hot
      plate first.<br>
      <br>
      A pressure relief safety valve 122 is provided above the liquid
      level of the vapor generator shell. This valve is set at
      approximately 4 psi and vents excessive vapor pressure through a
      condenser (not illustrated) to the fuel tank 10. A vaporized fuel
      outlet 124 is interconnected through a vapor pump 53, FIG. 1, to
      the carburetor.<br>
      <br>
      In operation, the coolant from the engine enters the hot plate
      generally in the range of about 250 DEG-260 DEG F. This extremely
      hot coolant passes through the relatively small mass comprising
      the hot plate tubes 112 which, in turn, heats the fuel immediately
      adjacent thereto. As the liquid fuel is maintained at a level just
      above the hot plate and, further, the temperature of the hot plate
      exceeds the boiling point both of alcohol and of water,
      vaporization of the both liquids occurs substantially in
      proportion to their respective constituent concentrations. Thus,
      fractional vaporization is avoided in the hot plate region.<br>
      <br>
      The engine coolant, having dissipated a portion of its heat energy
      in vaporizing the fuel, next enters the fuel preheat exchanger 04
      at a temperature of approximately 200 DEG F. where it serves to
      preheat the incoming alcohol based fuel from ambient to a
      temperature somewhat below the boiling point of alcohol, 178 DEG
      F. Temperatures in excess of this boiling point increase
      fractional distillation while substantially lower temperatures
      decrease vaporizer efficiency. The coolant is returned through a
      conduit 38, FIG. 1, to the engine for reheating.<br>
      <br>
      It will be appreciated that the coolant of the present invention
      not only functions to maintain proper engine operating
      temperatures, but importantly, serves the dual purpose of
      vaporizing the alcohol fuel thereby substantially improving engine
      overall efficiency. It will be further noted that the alcohol
      steam internal combustion engine of the present invention is
      particularly adapted for energy reclamation for the following
      reasons. First, the alcohol based fuel burns at lower cylinder
      temperatures thereby lowering the overall cooling system loss of
      heat and, further, rendering heat reclamation easier due to its
      inherently lower temperature. In addition, the steam operation of
      the present engine is uniquely suited for fuel preheating or
      vaporization wherein the water must be vaporized in order to
      produce useful work output. Conventional internal combustion
      engines do not realize the same improvements in efficiency by
      vaporizing the fuel and, in any event, the handling of vaporized
      gasoline presents potential safety problems.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 8 illustrates the electronically controlled carburetor which
      is required where low, or varying, fuel proofages (grades) are
      contemplated. The typical vapor carburetor operates on the
      volumetric ratio principle which provides marginal performance in
      view of the range of volumetric ratios encountered. Thus, for
      example, the air-fuel ratio of the propane utilized for cold
      weather starting of the present engine is 17-to-1; ethanol is
      10-to-1; while 100 proof ethanol, due to the concentration of
      water which does not require oxygen, is only 5-to-1. This wide
      variation between usable fuels prohibits the effective use of
      conventional mechanical carburetors.<br>
      <br>
      The electronic carburetor of the present invention utilizes an
      oxygen sensor 140 in the exhaust manifold 142 interconnected
      through conventional feedback control circuitry 144 to a servo
      motor 146 actuated butterfly valve 148. Valve 148 is positioned in
      the vapor fuel inlet 150 to the carburetor 152 and is
      automatically manipulated to maintain a predetermined exhaust gas
      oxygen content. In this manner a proper combustion mixture may be
      maintained for any fuel and each environmental condition thereby
      assuring minimal pollution due to complete fuel combustion. In
      addition, the relatively low combustion temperatures associated
      with the present internal combustion steam engine precludes the
      generation of nitrous oxides thereby further assuring an engine of
      very low pollution output.<br>
      <br>
      As previously indicated, it is desirable to preheat the carburetor
      inlet air to facilitate the generation of superheated steam in the
      cylinders. A carburetor air preheater 154 may be positioned in the
      exhaust manifold 142 as illustrated in FIG. 8 or, alternatively,
      the previously described preheater 60, FIG. 4, may be utilized. In
      either event, the temperature of the incoming carburetor air is
      preferably heated between 500 DEG and 600 DEG F. It is important
      that this incoming air not be heated substantially above 600 DEG
      F. in order that the auto-ignition temperature of ethanol, 685 DEG
      F., be safely avoided.<br>
