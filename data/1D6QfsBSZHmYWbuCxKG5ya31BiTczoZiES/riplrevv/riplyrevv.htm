      <p><br>
        This Canon of <i>Bridlington</i> flourished in the days of <i>Edward</i>
        the Fourth, King of <i>England</i>, to whom he wrote an
        Epistle, as in the beginning of this Book appeareth: a true
        Artist he was, as every one who hath attained the k knowledge in
        this Mastery can testifie. He wrote, among other writings, these
        <i>Twelve Gates of Alchymy</i>, which with the <i>Preface,
          Recapitulation, Erroneous Experiments</i> by him warned of,
        his <i>Epistle</i> to the King, <i>Vision</i>, and <i>Wheel</i>,
        I shall unfold. </p>
      <p>For his experience herein he was eminent, yea his Writings
        indeed are, in my opinion, for the fullness of them, and eminent
        descriptions of things, to be preferred before any that I have
        read or seen, yet I have seen many. </p>
      <p>I would detract from no candid well-deserving Author, but would
        ingenuously give them their due; yet <i>Ripley</i> to me seems
        to carry the Garland. </p>
      <p>For mine own part, I have cause to honour <i>Bernard Trevisan</i>,
        who is very ingenious, as in all his Writings, so especially in
        that Epistle of his to <i>Thomas of Bononia</i>, in which let
        me seriously profess, I received the main Light in this hidden
        Secret. I shall not name the place, but read the Epistle, and
        read it again and again, for in it is most excellent truth, and
        Naked truth. </p>
      <p>Next to him, or rather before him in some respects, is an
        author whom I will not name; yet truly all Chymical Writers are
        therein to be preferred by any man, by how far he gets good by
        them: one commends <i>Raymond Lully</i> before all, yet I
        remember not that ever I got good by reading of him: some in
        good sooth, who are not Professors of this Secret, write more
        edifyingly to the informing of a <i>Tyro</i>, then those whom
        skill hath made crafty, especially in such places where they
        intend nothing less then to discover such Secrets. I learned the
        Secret of the Philosophers <i>Magnes</i>, from one, of their
        Magical <i>Chalybs</i>, from another; the use of <i>Diana</i>’s



        Doves, from a third; the <i>Air</i>, or rather the <i>Camelion</i>
        of the Philosophers. From another; the gross Preparation of
        their <i>Menstruum</i>, in another; the number of <i>Eagles</i>,
        in another: but for the operation on the true Matter, and signs
        of the true <i>Mercury</i>, I know none like <i>Ripley</i>,
        though <i>Flammel</i> be eminent. I know what I say, as knowing
        experimentally the truth, and what is errour. </p>
      <p>For mine own part, I have had experience of misleading
        Sophistical Writers, and have made many toilsome laborious
        Experiments, though but young; and therefore having at length,
        through the undeserved mercy of God, arrived at my Haven of
        Rest, I shall stretch out my hand to such as are behind. </p>
      <p>I have wrote several Treatises, some in <i>English</i>, but
        especially in <i>Latine</i>; one <i>English</i> treatise
        touching the Stone, very plainly written, but not perfected,
        unfortunately slipt out of my hand, and perhaps may come abroad
        into the World; if it do, I should be sorry. Two <i>Latine</i>
        Tractates, one intituled, <i>Brevis manuductio ad Rubinum
          Coelestem</i>, another, <i>Fons Chymicae Philosophiae</i>, I
        wrote, which for especial Reasons to me known I resolve to
        suppress. Two other <i>Latine</i> Treatises, the one intituled,
        <i>Ars metallorum Metamorphoseas</i>, the other, <i>Introitus
          apertus ad occlussum Regis Palatium</i>, I lately wrote which
        perhaps thou mayst enjoy. Two <i>English</i> Poems I wrote,
        which are lost. Also an <i>Enchiridion</i> of Experiments,
        together with a Diurnal of Meditations, in which were many
        Philosophical Receipts declaring the whole Secret, with an <i>Aenigma</i>
        annexed; which also fell into such hands, who I conceive will
        never restore it. This last was written in <i>English</i>, with
        many other which I wrote for mine own recreation, and afterwards
        burned. </p>
      <p>But now at length studying how to profit the Sons of Art to my
        utmost, I have rather resolved to unfold <i>Ripley</i>’s Knots,
        and so thou mayst have two Witnesses in one; for by the
        unfolding of him thou shalt both see the depth of the Man, and
        discern that both he and I were truly, and not Sophistically,
        intrusted with this Divine Science and Art; in which it is not
        notional, as many men conceive the Art to be, but real
        Experiments of Nature, taught me by the only God and master of
        Nature, that was my Guide; having seen and made the Secret Water
        of the Philosophers, and known the use of it by ocular
        experience, to the effecting of the admirable <i>Elixir</i>.
        These writings peruse, for they are not Fancies, and so with the
        help of the most High, thou shalt attain thy wish. </p>

      <p>The <i>Compound of Alchemy</i> which seems to be most made use
        of in this <i>Book</i> for Quotations, agrees for the most part
        with the Edition published by Ralph Rabbards, and Printed at
        London 1591 in quarto, in which Edition the English is not so
        old as is that Copy which was published by Elias Ashmole Esq.:
        Yet I humbly conceive that this Expositor hath thought fir to
        clear the sense of the old English Verse, by the change of some
        few words, more significant to the present speech, and yet
        doubtless not differing from the mind of the Author; which
        change of words, I durst not presume to alter, but that I ought
        rather in justice to the Author to let them pass; and for this
        reason likewise, that whomsoever shall desire to see the
        difference, may easily compare all three together, because they
        are all published in Print: and in performing this service, I
        hope to have done my duty faithfully, and wronged no body. I
        likewise make bold to acquaint the Reader, that in the <i>Exposition</i>
        upon Sir G. Ripley’s <i>Preface</i>, in the <i>Learned Sophies
          Feast</i>, pag. 52. line 5. I find this word [greatest] which
        from what follows line 11. (I humbly conceive, with submission)
        should be [meanest] as may more manifestly appear from the same
        Author, in his <i>Secrets Revealed</i>, pag. 62, 63. and in Sir
        G. Ripley’s <i>5th Gate</i>, Stave 40. line 6. But because I
        found it [greatest price] in two copies, I therefore lest it so,
        and by this <i>Advertisement</i> submit it to the Readers
        Judgment. I have likewise found, that in the <i>Exposition upon
          Sir G. Ripley’s Epistle to King Edward</i> the 4 th. Pag. 9.
        line 2. for Mercury, some copies read Antimony, which is
        likewise left to the Readers scrutiny, by W.C.B. </p>

      <p>This Epistle as it was immediately written to a King, who was
        in his Generation, both wise and valiant; so it doth comprise
        the whole secret, both learnedly described, and yet artificially
        vailed. Yet as the Author testifieth, that in this Epistle he
        doth plainly untie the main knot; So I can, and do testifie with
        him, that there is nothing desirable for the true attaining of
        this Mystery, both in the Theory and Practick of it, which is
        not in this short Epistle fully taught. This then I intend as a
        Key to all my former writings, and assure you on my faithful
        word, that I shall not speak one word doubtfully or Mystically,
        as I have in all my other writings, seeming to aver some things,
        which taken without Figure, are utterly false, which we did only
        to conceal this Art. This Key therefore we intend not to make
        common; and shall intreat you to keep it secret to your self,
        and not to communicate it, except it be to a sure friend, who
        you are confident will not make it publick: And this request we
        make upon very good grounds, knowing that all our writings
        together, are nothing to this, by reason of the contradictions,
        which we have woven into them, which here is not done in the
        least measure. I shall therefore in this Epistle take up a new
        method, and that different from the former, and shall first draw
        up the substance of the Philosophy couched in this Epistle, into
        several conclusions, and after elucidate the same. </p>
      <p>The first Conclusion is drawn from the ninth Stave of this
        Epistle, the eight first Staves being only complementall; and
        that is, That as all things are multiplied in their kind, so may
        be Metalls, which have in themselves a capacity of being
        transmuted, the imperfect into perfect. </p>
      <p>The second Conclusion in the Tenth Stave is, That the main
        ground for the possibility of transmutation, is the possibility
        of reduction of all metals, and such minerals as are of
        metallick principles, into their first Mercurial matter. </p>
      <p>The third Conclusion is in the Eleventh Stave, that among so
        many Metaline and <i>Mineral Sulphurs</i>, and so many <i>Mercuries</i>
        there are but two <i>Sulphurs</i> that are related to our work;
        which <i>Sulphurs</i> have their <i>Mercuries</i> essentially
        united to them. </p>
      <p>The fourth Conclusion from the same Stave is, That he who
        understands these two <i>Sulphurs &amp; Mercuries</i> aright,
        shall find that the one is the most pure red <i>Sulphur of Gold</i>,
        which is <i>Sulphur in manifesto</i>, and <i>Mercurius in
          occulto</i>, and that other is most pure white <i>Mercury</i>,
        which in indeed true <i>Quicksilver in manifesto</i>, and <i>Sulphur



          in occulto</i>, these are our two Principles. </p>
      <p>The fifth Conclusion from the Twelfth Stave is, That if a mans
        Principles be true, and his Operations regular, his event will
        be certain, which Event is no other than the true Mystery. </p>
      <p>These Conclusions are but few in number, but of great weight or
        concernment; the Amplification, Illustration and Elucidation
        therefore of them, will make a son of Art truly glad. </p>
      <p><b><i>STAVE</i> IX</b>. In the edition 1591: but in Esq. <i>Ashmole’s



          Theatrum</i> it is Stave 8. </p>
      <p><i>But notwithstanding for peril that may befall,</i> <br>
        <i>If I dare not here plainly the knot unbind,</i> <br>
        <i>Yet in my writing I will not be so mysticall,</i> <br>
        <i>But that by study the true Knowledge you may find</i> <br>
        <i>How that each thing is multiplied in its kind,</i> <br>
        <i>And how the likeness of Bodies Metalline be transmutable,</i>
        <br>
        <i>I will declare, that if you feel me in your mind,</i> <br>
        <i>My writing you shall find true, and no fained Fable.</i> </p>
      <p>For the First; Forasmuch as it is not for our purpose here to
        invite any to the Art, only intending to lead and guide the sons
        of Art; We shall not prove the possibility of <i>Alchymy</i>,
        by many Arguments, having done it abundantly in another
        Treatise. He then that will be incredulous, let him be
        incredulous; he that will cavil, let him cavil; but he whose
        mind is perswaded of the truth of this Art, and of its Dignity,
        let him attend to what is in the Illustration of these Five
        Conclusions discovered, and his heart shall certainly rejoice.
        We shall therefore briefly Illustrate this 1st Conclusion, and
        insist there more largely, where the secrets of the Art are most
        couched. </p>
      <p>For this first, which concludes in effect the truth of the Art,
        and its validity; he that would therein be more satisfied in it,
        let him read the <i>Testimony of the Philosophers</i>: And he
        that will not believe the testimony of so many men, being most
        of them men of renown in their own times, he will cavil also
        against all other Arguments. </p>
      <p>We shall only hold to <i>Ripley</i>’s Testimony in this our
        Key, who in the Fourth Stave, assures the King that at <i>Lovain</i>
        he first saw the greatest and most perfect secrets, namely, the
        two <i>Elixirs</i>; and in his following verses, craved his
        confident credit, that he himself hath truly found the way of
        secret <i>Alchymy</i>, and promiseth the discovery of it to the
        King, only upon the condition of secrecy. </p>
      <p>And in the Eighth Stave, though he protests never to write it
        by Pen, yet proffers the King at his pleasure, to shew him
        occularly the Red and White <i>Elixir</i>, and the working of
        them, which he promiseth will be done for easie costs in time.
        So then, he that will doubt the truth of this Art, must account
        this famous Author for a most simple mad Sophister. To write and
        offer such things to his Prince, unless he were able in effect
        to do what he promised; from which imputation, his Writings, and
        also the History of him, of his Fame, Gravity, and Worth, will
        sufficiently clear him. </p>
      <p><b><i>STAVE</i> X</b> </p>
      <p><i>As the Philosopher in the Book of Meteors doth write,</i> <br>
        <i>The likeness of Bodies Metalline be not transmutable,</i> <br>
        <i>But after he added these words of more delight,</i> <br>
        <i>Without they be reduced to their beginning materiable,</i> <br>
        <i>Wherefore such Bodies which in Nature be liquefiable,</i> <br>
        <i>Mineral &amp; Metalline may be mercurizate,</i> <br>
        <i>Conceive you may this Science is not opinionable,</i> <br>
        <i>But very true, by Raymond and others determinate.</i> </p>
      <p>We come to the second Conclusion; the substance of which is, <i>that
all



          Metalls, and Bodies of Metalline Principles, may be reduced to
          their first Mercurial Matter</i>; And this is the main and
        chief ground for the possibility of Transmutation. On this we
        must insist largely and fully, for (trust me) this is the very
        hinge on which our secrets hang. </p>
      <p><i>First</i>, Then know that all <i>Metalls</i>, and several <i>Minerals</i>
        have <i>Mercury</i> for their next matter, to which (for the
        most part, nay indeed always) there adheres, and is
        Con-coagulated an external <i>Sulphur</i>, which is not <i>Metalline</i>,
        but distinguishable from the internal Kernel of the <i>Mercury</i>.
      </p>
      <p>This <i>Sulphur</i> is not wanting even in common <i>Argent
          Vive</i>, by the Mediation of which, it may be precipitated
        into the form of a drie Powder: yea, and by a Liquor well known
        to us, (though nothing helping the Art of transmutation) it may
        be so fixed, that it may endure all Fires, the Test and Coppel.
        And this without the addition of any thing to it, but the Liquor
        (by virtue whereof it is fixed) coming away intire, both in its
        <i>Pondus</i> and Virtue. This <i>Sulphur</i> in Gold and
        Silver is pure; Therefore in Gold and Silver it is fixed, in
        others it is fugitive; in all the Metalls it is coagulated, in <i>Mercury</i>
        or <i>Argent Vive</i>, it is coagulable, in <i>Gold, Silver</i>
        and <i>Mercury</i>; this <i>Sulphur</i> is so strongly united,
        that the Antients did ever judge <i>Sulphur</i> and <i>Mercury</i>,
        to be all one; but we by the help of a Liquor, the Invention of
        which in these parts of the world we owe to <i>Paracelsus</i>
        (though among the <i>Moors</i> and <i>Arabians</i>, it hath
        been, and is (at this day) commonly known to the acuter sort of
        <i>Chymists</i>.) By this I say, we know that the <i>Sulphur</i>
        which is in <i>Mercury</i> coagulable, and in the <i>Metals</i>
        coagulated, is external to the Internal nature of <i>Mercury</i>,
        and may be separated in the form of a tincted Metallick Oyl, the
        remaining <i>Mercury</i> being then void of all <i>Sulphur</i>,
        save that which may be called its Inward or Central <i>Sulphur</i>.
        And is now incoagulable of itself (though by our <i>Elixir</i>
        it is to be coagulated) but of it self, it can neither be fixt
        nor precipitated, nor sublimed, but remains unaltered in all
        corrosive waters, and in all digestions of heat. One way then of
        <i>Mercury</i> Azating all <i>Metals</i> and <i>Minerals</i>,
        is by the Liquor <i>Alchahest</i>, which out of such Bodies as
        have <i>Mercury</i> in their Constitution, can separate a
        running <i>Argent Vive</i>, from which <i>Argent vive</i> all
        its <i>Sulphur</i> is then separated, save that only which is
        Internal and Central to the <i>Mercury</i>, which Internal <i>Sulphur



          of Mercury</i> no corrosive can touch: Next to this way of
        universal Reduction, there are also some other particular ways
        by which <i>Saturn, Jupiter, Antimony</i>, yea even <i>Venus</i>
        and <i>Mars</i> may be reduced into a running <i>Quick-silver</i>,
        by the help of Salts, which because (being corporeal) they
        pierce not so radically as the fore-named Liquor doth; they
        therefore do not spoil the <i>Mercury</i> of its <i>Sulphur</i>,
        but that as much <i>Sulphur</i> as there in is <i>Common
          Mercury</i>; so much also there in is this <i>Mercury</i> of
        the Bodies, only this <i>Mercury</i> hath specificated
        qualities according to the nature of the <i>Metal</i> or <i>Mineral</i>,
        from which it was extracted; and for that reason, (as to our
        work which is to dissolve perfect Species of <i>Metals</i>,) it
        hath no more virtue then common <i>Argent Vive</i>. There is
        than but one only humidity, which is applicable unto our Work,
        which certainly is neither of <i>Saturn</i> nor <i>Venus</i>,
        nor is drawn from any thing, which nature hath formed, but from
        a substance compounded by the Art of the Philosopher. So then,
        if a <i>Mercury</i> drawn from the Bodies, have not only the
        same deficiency of heat and superfluity of <i>faeces</i> as
        Common <i>Mercury</i> hath, but also a distinct specificated
        form, it must (by reason of this its form) be so much the
        farther remote from our <i>Mercury</i>, then common <i>Argent
          Vive</i> is. </p>
      <p>Our Art therefore is to compound two Principles, (one in which
        the <i>Salt</i>, and another in which the <i>Sulphur</i> of
        nature doth abound,) which are not yet perfect, nor yet totally
        imperfect, and (by consequence) may therefore (by our Art) be
        changed or exalted, which that (which is totally perfect) cannot
        be; and then by Common <i>Mercury</i> to extract not the <i>Pondus</i>,
        but the Coelestial virtue out of the compound; </p>
      <p>Which virtue (being Fermental) begets in the common <i>Mercury</i>
        an Offspring more noble then it self, which is our true <i>Hermaphrodite</i>,
        which will congeal it self, and dissolve the Bodies: Observe but
        a grain of Corn, in which, scarce a discernable part is Sprout,
        and this Sprout, if it were out of the grain, would die in a
        moment; the whole grain is sown, yet the Sprout only produceth
        the herb: So is it in our Body, the fermental Spirit that is in
        it, is scarce a third part of the whole, the rest is of no
        value, yet all is joined, (in the composition,) and the <i>faeculent



          coporeous</i> parts of the Body comes away with the dregs of
        the Mercury. But beyond the example or similitude given of a
        grain of Corn, it may be observed that the hidden and spiritual
        virtue of this our Body, doth purge and purifie its Matrix of
        water, in which it is sown; that is, it makes it cast forth a
        great quantity of filthy earth, and a great deal of Hydropical
        Saline moisture. For instance, make thy washings (for a tryal)
        with pure and clean Fountain water; weigh first a Pint of the
        same water, and take the exact weight of it, then wash thy
        compound 8 or 10 Eagles (or times), save all the <i>faeces</i>,
        weigh thy Body and <i>Mercury</i> exactly, weigh thy <i>faeces</i>
        being very dry, then&nbsp; Distil or Sublime all that will
        Sublime, a very little quick <i>Mercury</i> will ascend, then
        put the residue of the <i>faeces</i> in a Crucible, set them on
        the Coals, and all the faeculency of the <i>Mercury</i> will
        burn like a Coal, yet without fume; when that is all consumed,
        weigh the remaining <i>faeces</i>, and thou shalt find them to
        be two thirds of thy Body, the other third being in the <i>Mercury</i>;
        weigh the <i>Mercury</i> which thou Sublimest, and the Mercury
        prepared by it self, and the weight of both will not recompence
        thy <i>Mercuries</i> weight by far: So then, boyl up thy water
        to a skin, in which thou madest thy Lotions, for that is a thick
        water; and in a cool place thou shalt have Crystals, which is
        the Salt of <i>Mercury</i> Crude, and no way fit for Medicines;
        yet it is a content for the Artists to see how the
        Heterogeneities of <i>Mercury</i> are discovered, which no Art
        save the Liquor of <i>Alcahest</i> can do, and that in a
        destructive, not a generative way as this is; for this operation
        of ours is made between male and Female, within their own kind,
        between which there is a Ferment which effecteth that which no
        other thing in the world could do. In all truth I tell you, that
        if you should take our imperfect compound Body, <i>per se</i>
        and <i>Mercury per se</i>, and Ferment them alone, though you
        might bring out of the one a most pure <i>Sulphur</i>, and out
        of the other <i>Mercury</i> of <i>Mercury</i>, which is the
        Nut of Mercury, yet with these thou couldst effect nothing, for
        Fermental virtue is the wonder of the world, and it is by it,
        that water becomes Herbs, Trees and Plants, Fruits, Flesh,
        Blood, Stones, Minerals, and every thing; seek then for it only,
        and rejoice in it, as in a deservedly invaluable treasure: Now
        know, that Fermentation works or ferments not out of kind,
        neither do Salts Ferment metals. Wilt thou then know whence it
        is that some fixt Alcalies do extract a <i>Mercury</i> out of <i>Minerals</i>,
        and out of the more imperfect Metals? Consider then, that in all
        these Bodies the <i>Sulphur</i> is not so radically mixt and
        untied, as it is in Silver and Gold. Now <i>Sulphur</i> is of
        kin to divers <i>Alcalies</i>, that are extraordinarily
        dissolved or melted with it, and by this means the <i>Mercurial</i>
        parts are disjoined, and the <i>Argent vive</i> is by fire
        separated. The <i>Mercury</i> thus separated, is spoiled of its
        <i>Sulphur</i>, when as indeed there needs, or is required only
        a depuration of the <i>Sulphur</i> by separating the impure
        from the pure; but these Salts having separated the <i>Sulphur</i>,
        do leave the <i>Mercury</i> worse, that is, more estranged from
        a Metallick nature than it was before; for in its Composition
        that <i>Sulphur of Saturn</i> will not burn, for though it be
        Sublimed, Calcined, made Sugar or Vitrified, yet by Fire and
        Fluxes it still returns to the same it was in before; but its <i>Sulphur</i>
        being (as is aforesaid,) separated, will take fire if joined
        with Salt-peter, even as common <i>Sulphur</i> doth, so that
        the Salts act on the <i>Sulphur</i> of which they rob the <i>Mercury</i>,
        but on the <i>Mercury</i> they act not for want of Ferment,
        which is not to be found, but only amongst Homogeneal things.
        Therefore the Ferment of Bread Leavens not a Stone, nor doth the
        Ferment of any Animal or Vegetable, Ferment a Metal or Mineral.
        So then, though out of Gold thou mightest obtain a <i>Mercury</i>
        by help of the Liquor of the first <i>Ens</i> of Salt, yet that
        <i>Mercury</i> would never accomplish our work: whereas on the
        other side <i>Mercury</i> made out of Gold by our <i>Mercury</i>,
        though there be three parts of our <i>Mercury</i> to one of
        Gold: This <i>Mercury</i> I say, will (by continual digestion)
        accomplish the whole work; marvel not then, that our <i>Mercury</i>
        is more powerful, which is prepared by <i>Mercury</i>: For
        certainly the Ferment, which cometh between the compound Body
        and the water, causeth a death and a regeneration; it doth that,
        which nothing in the world can do: Besides it severs from <i>Mercury</i>
        a terrestreity which burns like a coal, and an Hydropical humour
        melting in common water, but the residue is actuated by a Spirit
        of Life, which is our true embryonated <i>Sulphur</i> of our
        water, not visible, yet working visibly. We conclude them, that
        all operations for our <i>Mercury</i>, but by common <i>Mercury</i>,
        and our Body according to our Art, are erroneous, and will never
        produce our Mysterie, although they might be otherwise, <i>Mercuries</i>
        so wonderfully made. For as the Author of the <i>New Light</i>,
        saith, <i>No Water in any Island of the Philosophers was
          wholsom, but that which was drawn out of the reigns of</i> Sol
        <i>and</i> Luna. Wilt thou know what that means, <i>Mercury</i>
        in its <i>pondus</i> and incombustibility is <i>Gold fugitive</i>,
        our Body in its purity is called the <i>Philosophers Luna</i>,
        being far more pure than the imperfect Metals, and its <i>Sulphur</i>
        also as pure as the <i>Sulphur of Sol</i>, not that it is
        indeed <i>Luna</i>, for it abides not in the fire. Now in the
        composition of these three; First our common <i>Mercury</i>,
        and the two Principles of our compound there intercedes the
        Ferment of <i>Luna</i>, out of which though it be a Body,
        proceeds yet a specificated odour: yea, and oft the <i>Pondus</i>
        of it is diminished: If the Compound be much washt, after it is
        sufficiently clean. So then, the Ferment of <i>Sol</i> and <i>Luna</i>
        intercedes in our composition, which Ferment begets an
        off-spring more noble then it self a thousand fold; whereas
        shouldst thou work on our compound body by a violent way of
        Salts, thou shouldst have the <i>Mercury</i>, by far less noble
        then the Body, the <i>Sulphur</i> of the Body being separated,
        and not exalted by such a progress. </p>
      <p><b><i>STAVE</i> XI.</b> </p>
      <p><i>In the said Book the Philosopher speaketh also,</i> <br>
        <i>Herein if it please Your Highness for to read,</i> <br>
        <i>Of divers Sulphurs, and especially of two,</i> <br>
        <i>And of two Mercuries joined to them indeed,</i> <br>
        <i>Whereby he doth true understanders lead,</i> <br>
        <i>To the knowledge of the Principles which be only true,</i> <br>
        <i>Both Red, Moist, Pure, and White, as I have espied,</i> <br>
        <i>Which be nevertheless found but of very few.</i> </p>
      <p>We now come to the Third Conclusion, which is, that among all
        Metalline and Mineral <i>Sulphurs</i> there are only Two that
        belong to our Work; which Two have their <i>Mercuries</i>
        essentially united with them: This is the truth of our secrets,
        though we (to seduce the unwary) do seem to aver the contrary;
        for do no think that (because we do insinuate two ways,
        therefore) we really mean as we say, for verily (as witnesseth <i>Ripley</i>,)
There



        is no true Principle but one, nor have we but one matter, nor
        but one way of working upon that matter, nor but one regimen of
        heat, and one linear way of proceeding. </p>
      <p>These two <i>Sulphurs</i> as they are Principles of our Work,
        they ought to be Homogeneal, for it only Gold Spiritual that we
        seek; First White, then Red, which Gold is no other then that
        which the vulgar see, but they know not the hidden Spirit that
        is in it. This Principle wants nothing but composition, and this
        composition must be made with our other crude white <i>Sulphur</i>,
        which is nothing but <i>Mercury</i> vulgar, by frequent
        cohobation of it upon our Hermaphroditical body, so long till it
        become a fiery water. </p>
      <p>Know therefore, that <i>Mercury</i> hath in itself a <i>Sulphur</i>,
        which being un-active, our Art is to multiply in it a living
        active <i>Sulphur</i>, which comes out of the loins of our
        Hermaphroditical body, whose Father is a Metal, and his Mother a
        Mineral; Take then the most beloved Daughter of <i>Saturn</i>,
        whose Arms are a <i>Circle Argent</i>, and on it a <i>Sable
          Cross on a Black Field</i>, which is the signal note of the
        great world, espouse her to the most warlike God, who dwells in
        the house of <i>Aries</i>, and thou shalt find the Salt Nature,
        with this Salt acuate thy water, as thou best knowest, and thou
        shalt have the Lunary bath in which the Sun will be amended. </p>
      <p>And in all truth I assure thee, that although thou hadst our
        Body Mercurialized (without the addition of <i>Mercury</i>, or
        of the <i>Mercury</i> of any of the Metals) made <i>per se</i>,
        that is, without the addition of <i>Mercury</i>, it would not
        be in the least profitable unto thee, for it is our <i>Mercury</i>
        only, which hath a Celestial form and power, which it receives,
        not only, nor so much from the Compound Body or Principles, as
        from the Fermental virtue which proceeds from the composition of
        both the Body and the <i>Mercury</i>, by which is produced a
        wonderful Creature: So then let all thy care be to marry <i>Sulphur</i>
        with <i>Sulphur</i>, that is our <i>Mercury</i> which is
        impregnated, which <i>Sulphur</i> must be espoused with our <i>Sol</i>,
        then hast thou two <i>Sulphurs</i> married, and two <i>Mercuries</i>
        of one off-spring, whose Mother is the Sun, and Moon the Mother.
      </p>
      <p>The Fourth Conclusion makes all perfectly plain which hath been
        said before; namely, that these two <i>Sulphurs</i> are, the
        one most pure Red <i>Sulphur of Gold</i>, and the other of most
        pure clean White <i>Mercury</i>. </p>
      <p>These are our two <i>Sulphurs</i>; the one appears a
        coagulated Body, &amp; yet carries its <i>Mercury</i> in its
        belly: the other is in all it proportions true <i>Mercury</i>,
        yet very clean, and carries its <i>Sulphur</i> within its self,
        though hidden under the form and flexibility of <i>Mercury</i>.
      </p>
      <p>Sophisters are (here) in a Labyrinth, for because they are not
        acquainted with Metalline love, they work in things altogether
        heterogeneal; or if they work upon Metalline Bodies, they yet
        either joyn Males with Males, or else Females with Females, or
        else they work on each alone; or else they make Males which are
        charged with natural inabilities, and Females whose Matrix is
        vitiated. Thus by their own inconsideration they frustrate their
        own hopes, and then cast the blame upon the Art, when as indeed
        it is only to be imputed to their own folly, in not
        understanding the Philosophers. </p>
      <p>I know many pitiful Sophisters do dote on many Stones,
        Vegetable, Animal, and Mineral; and some to those add the fiery
        Angelical, Paradaical Stone, which they call a Wonder-working
        Essence; and because the mark they aim at is so great, the ways
        also by which they would attain their scope, they make also
        agreeable, that is a double way; One way they call <i>Via
          Humida</i>, the other they call <i>Via Sicca</i>, (to use
        their languages:) the latter way is the <i>Labyrinthian path</i>,
        which is fit only for the great ones of the earth to tread in;
        the other the <i>Daedalean Path</i>, an easie way of small cost
        for the poor of the world to enterprise. </p>
      <p>But this I know, and can testifie, that there is but one way,
        and but only one <i>Regimen</i>, no more colours than ours; and
        what we say or write otherwise, is but to deceive the unwary:
        For if every thing n the world ought to have its proper causes,
        there cannot be any one end which is produced from two wayes of
        working on distinct Principles. </p>
      <p>Therefore we protest, and must again admonish the Reader, that
        in our former writings) we have concealed much, by reason of the
        two ways we have insinuated, which we will briefly touch; There
        is one Work of ours, which is the <i>Play of Children, and the
          Work of Women</i>, and that is Decoction by the Fire; and we
        protest that the lowest degree of this our work, is, that the
        matter be stirred up, and may hourly circulate without fear of
        breaking the Vessel, which for this reason ought to be very
        strong; but our lineal Decoction is an Internal Work, which
        advances every day and hour, and is distinct from that of
        outward heat, and therefore is both invisible and insensible. In
        this our work, our <i>Diana</i> is our body when it is mixed
        with the water, for then all is called the Moon; for <i>Laton</i>
        is whitened, and the Woman bears rule: our <i>Diana</i> hath a
        wood, for in the first days of the Stone, our Body after it is
        whitened grows vegetably. In this wood are at the last found two
        Doves; for about the end of three weeks the Soul of the <i>Mercury</i>
        ascends with the Soul of the dissolved Gold; these are infolded
        in the everlasting Arms of <i>Venus</i>, for in this season the
        confections are all tincted with a pure green colour; These
        Doves are circulated seven times, for in seven is perfection,
        and they are left dead, for they then rise and move no more; our
        Body is then black like to a Crow’s Bill, for in this operation
        all is turned to Powder, blacker than the blackest. Such
        passages as these we do oftentimes use when we speak of the
        Preparation of our <i>Mercury</i>; and this we do to deceive
        the simple, and it is also for no other end that we confound our
        operations, speaking of one, when we ought to speak of another;
        For if this Art were but plainly set down, our operations would
        be contemptible even to the foolish. Therefore believe me in
        this, that because our works are natural, we therefore do take
        the liberty to confound the Philosophers work with that which
        purely Natures work, that so we might keep the simple in
        ignorance concerning our true Vinegre, which being unknown,
        their labour is wholly lost. </p>
      <p>Let me then (for a close) say only thus much; Take our Body
        which is gold, and our <i>Mercury</i> which is seven times
        actuated by the marriage of it with our Hermaphroditical body
        which is a <i>Chaos</i>, and it is the splendor of the Soul of
        the God <i>Mars</i>, in the Earth and water of <i>Saturn</i>;
        mix these two in such a <i>Pondus</i> as Nature doth require:
        in this mixture you have our invisible Fires, for in the Water,
        or in the <i>Mercury</i> is an active <i>Sulphur</i> or
        Mineral Fire, and in the Gold a dead, passive, but yet actual <i>Sulphur</i>;
        Now when that <i>Sulphur</i> of the Gold is stirred up and
        quickened, there is made between the Fire of Nature which is in
        the Gold and the Fire against Nature, which is in the <i>Mercury</i>,
        a Fire partly of the one, and partly of the other, for it
        partakes of both; and by these two Fires thus united into one,
        is caused both Corruption (which is Humiliation) and Generation
        (which is Glorification and Perfection.) Now know that God only
        governs this way of the Internal Fire, Man being ignorant of the
        progress thereof, only by his Reason beholding its operations,
        he is able to discern that it is hot; that is, that it doth
        perform the actions of heat, which is Decoction. In this Fire
        there is no Sublimation, for Sublimation is an Exaltation; but
        this Fire is such an Exaltation, that it is perfection it self,
        and that beyond it is no progress. </p>
      <p>All our Work then is only to multiply this Fire, that is, to
        circulate the Body, so longs until the Virtue of the <i>Sulphur</i>
        be augmented. Again, this Fire is an invisible Spirit, and
        therefore not having Dimensions as neither above nor below, but
        every where in the Sphere of the activity of our Matter in the
        Vessel; So that through the material visible substance do
        sublime and ascend by the action of the elemental heat, yet this
        Spiritual Virtue is always as well in that which subsides in the
        bottom, as in that which is in the upper part of the Vessel. For
        it is as the Soul in the Body of Man, which is every where at
        the same time, and yet bounded or terminated in none. </p>
      <p>This is the Ground of one Sophism of ours, (<i>viz</i>.) when
        we say, that in this true Philosophical Fire there is no
        Sublimation; for the Fire is the Life, and the Life is a Soul,
        which is not at all subject to the dimensions of Bodies: Hence
        also it is, that the opening of the Glass, or cooling of the
        same during the time of Working, kills the Life or Fire that is
        in this secret <i>Sulphur</i>, and yet not one Grain of the
        matter is lost. The Elemental Fire then is that which any Child
        knows how to kindle and govern, but it is the Philosopher only
        that is able to discern the true inward Fire, for it is a
        wonderful thing which acts in the Body, yet is no part of the
        Body. Therefore the Fire is a Coelestial Virtue, it is
        uniformed; that is, it is always the same until the period of
        its Operation is come; and then being come to perfection, it
        acts no more, for every Agent, when the end of its action is
        come, then rests. </p>
      <p>Remember then, that when we speak of our Fire which sublimes
        not, that thou do not mistake, and think that the moisture of
        the Compound which is within the Glass, ought not to Sublime,
        for that it must do uncessantly; but the Fire that sublimes not
        is the Metalline love, which is above, and below, and in all
        places alike. Now then for a close to all that has been said,
        learn, and be well advised what matter thou take in hand, for an
        evil Crow lays an evil Egg, as the proverb hath it; Let thy Seed
        be pure, and thy Matrix also pure, then shalt thou see a Noble
        Off-spring: Let the Fire without be such, as in which our
        Confections may play to and fro uncessantly, and this (in a few
        days) will produce that which thou most longest for, the <i>Crows


          Bill</i>. Continue then thy Decoction, and in an hundred and
        thirty days thou shalt see the <i>White Dove</i>, and in ninety
        days more the <i>Sparkling Cherubim</i>. </p>
      <p><b><i>STAVE</i> XII.</b> </p>
      <p><i>And these Two things be best, he addeth anon,</i> <br>
        <i>For him that worketh the Alchymy to take:</i> <br>
        <i>Our Gold and our Silver therewith to make all one,</i> <br>
        <i>Wherefore I say, who will our Pearl and Ruby make,</i> <br>
        <i>The said Principles look that he not forsake:</i> <br>
        <i>For at the beginning, if the principles be true;</i> <br>
        <i>And if so be by craft he can them also take,</i> <br>
        <i>In th’ end truly his work he shall not rue.</i> </p>
      <p>Thus come we to the last Conclusion, which is, that if a Mans
        Operations be regular, and his Principles true, his end will be
        certain, (<i>viz</i>.) the Mastery. </p>
      <p>O Fools and Blind that do not consider how each thing in the
        world hath his proper Cause and Progress in Operation; Think
        you, if a Seaman should with a gallant Coach, intend to Sail to
        any place beyond the Sea, he would not find his attempt
        gallantly furnished, he should Row at Random, he may not sooner
        stumble on an infortunate Rock, then arrive at the golden Coast:
        Such fools are they who seek our secret in trivial matters, and
        yet hope to find the Gold of <i>Ophir</i>. </p>
      <p><i>For the more exact Guiding of your Practice, take notice of
          these Twenty Rules following.</i> </p>
      <p><i>Rule</i> I. </p>
      <p>Whatever any Sophister may suggest unto you, or you may read in
        any Sophistical Authors; yet let none take you from this ground,
        (<i>viz</i>.) That as the end you look for is Gold: so let Gold
        be the subject on which you work, and none other. </p>
      <p><i>Rule</i> II. </p>
      <p>Let none deceive you with telling you, that our <i>Gold</i> is
        not common, but Philosophical; for <i>common Gold</i> is dead,
        which is true: But as we order it, there is made a quickening of
        it, as a grain of Corn in the Earth is quickened. </p>
      <p>So then in our work, after six Weeks, <i>Gold</i> that was
        dead, becomes quick, living, and spermatical; and in our
        composition, it may be called <i>Our Gold</i>, because it is
        joined with an Agent that will certainly quicken it: So a
        Condemned Man, is called a Dead man, though at present living. </p>
      <p><i>Rule</i> III. </p>
      <p>Besides Gold, which is the Body or male, you must have another
        Sperm, which is the Spirit and Soul; or Female, and this is <i>Mercury</i>,
        in Flux and Form like to common <i>Argent Vive</i>, yet more
        clean and pure. </p>
      <p>There are many, who instead of <i>Mercury</i>, will have
        strange Waters or Liquors, which they stile by the name of <i>Philosophical



          Mercury</i>; be not deceived by them, for what a Man sows,
        that he must look to reap: If thou shalt sow thy Body in any
        Earth, but that which is Metalline and Homogeneal to it, thou
        shalt instead of a <i>Metalline Elixir</i>, reap an
        unprofitable <i>Calx</i>, which will be of no value. </p>
      <p><i>Rule</i> IV. </p>
      <p>Our <i>Mercury</i> is in substance one with common <i>Argent
          Vive</i>, but far different in Form; For it hath a Form
        Coelestial, Fiery, and of excellent Virtue: and this is the
        Nature which it receives by our Artificial Preparation. </p>
      <p><i>Rule</i> V. </p>
      <p>The whole Secret of our Preparation, is, that thou take that
        Mineral which is next of kin to Gold, and to <i>Mercury</i>;
        Impregnate this with Volatile Gold, which is found in the reins
        of mars, with this purifie your <i>Mercury</i> until seven
        times are past, then it is fitted for the Kings Bath. </p>
      <p><i>Rule</i> VI. </p>
      <p>Yet know, that from seven times to ten, the <i>Mercury</i> is
        made better and better, and is more active, being by each
        Preparation actuated by our true <i>Sulphur</i>; which if it
        exceed in number of Preparations, becomes too fiery, which
        instead of dissolving the Body, will Coagulate it self. </p>
      <p><i>Rule</i> VII. </p>
      <p>This <i>Mercury</i> thus actuated, is after to be distilled in
        a Glass retort twice or thrice; and that for this reason,
        because some Atoms of the Body may be in it, which were
        insensibly left in the Preparation of the <i>Mercury</i>,
        afterwards it is to be cleansed well with Vinegar and <i>Sal-armoniack</i>,
        then it is fit for the work. </p>
      <p><i>Rule</i> VIII. </p>
      <p>Chuse your Gold for this work pure and clean from any mixture:
        if it be not so when you buy it, make it so by Purgation; then
        let it me made fine, either by Filing, Malleating, Calcining
        with Corrosives, or any other way, by which it may be made most
        subtile. </p>
      <p><i>Rule</i> IX. </p>
      <p>Now come to your mixture, in which take of the aforesaid Body
        so chosen and prepared, one Ounce of <i>Mercury</i>, as is
        above taught animated, two ounces or three at the most, mix them
        in a Marble which may be warmed so hot as water will heat it;
        grind both together till they be well incorporated, then wash
        the mixture with Vinegar and Salt till it be very pure; And
        lastly, Dulcifie it with warm water, and dry it carefully. </p>
      <p><i>Rule</i> X. </p>
      <p>Know now, that whatever we say out of Envy, our way is none
        other, and we protest, and will protest, that neither We, nor
        any of the Antients knew any other way; for it is impossible
        that our secret can be wrought by any other Principles, or any
        other disposition than this. Our Sophism lies only in the two
        kinds of Fire in our work: the Internal secret Fire, which is
        Gods Instrument, hath no qualities perceptible to man, of that
        Fire we speak often, and seem yet to speak of the External heat;
        and hence arise among the unwary many Errours. This is our Fire
        which is graduated, for the External heat, is almost linear all
        the work, to the white work, it is one without alteration, save
        that in the seven first days we keep the heat a little slack for
        certainty and security sake, which an experienced Philosopher
        need not do. </p>
      <p>But the Internal governing heat is insensibly graduated hourly,
        and by how much that is daily invigorated by the continuance of
        Decoction, the Colours are altered, and the Compound maturated:
        I have unfolded a main knot unto you, take heed of being
        insnared here again. </p>
      <p><i>Rule</i> XI. </p>
      <p>Then you must provide a Glass Tun, in which you may perfect
        your work, without which you could never do any thing; let it be
        either Oval or Spherical, so big in reference to your Compound,
        that it may hold about twelve times the quantity of it within
        its Sphere, let your Glass be thick and strong, clear, and free
        of flaws, with a neck about a Span or Foot long; In this Egg put
        your matter, sealing the neck carefully, without flaw, or crack,
        or hole, for the least vent will let out the subtile Spirit, and
        destroy the work. </p>
      <p>You may know the exact Sealing of your Glass thus, when it is
        cold, put the neck where it is sealed, into your mouth, and suck
        it strongly; if there be the least vent, you will draw out the
        Air, that is in the Vial, into your mouth, which when you take
        the Glass from your mouth, is again suckt into the Glass with a
        hissing, so that your ear may perceive the noise; this is an
        undoubted tryal. </p>
      <p><i>Rule</i> XII. </p>
      <p>You must then provide your self with a Furnace, by wise men
        called an<i>Athanor</i>, in which you may accomplish your work;
        nor will any one serve in your first work; But such a one in
        which you may give a heat obscurely red at your pleasure, or
        lesser, it may endure twelve hours at the least. </p>
      <p>This if you would obtain; Observe, First, that your nest be no
        bigger then to contain your dish with about an inch vacancy at
        the side where the Vent-hole of your <i>Athanor</i>, is for the
        Fire to play. </p>
      <p>Secondly, Let your Dish be no bigger then to hold one Glass
        with about an inch thickness of Ashes between the Glass and
        side, remembering the word of the Philosopher, One Glass, One
        Thing, One Furnace; for such a Dish standing with the bottom
        level to the vent-hole, which in such a Furnace ought to be but
        one, about three Inches Diameter, sloping upwards, will with the
        stream of Flame, which is always playing to the top of the
        Vessel, and round about the bottom, be kept always in a glowing
        heat. </p>
      <p>Thirdly, If your Dish be bigger, your Furnace must be within a
        third part, or a fourth as big as your Platter is Diameter. Else
        it cannot be exactly, nor continually heated. </p>
      <p>Fourthly, If your Tower be above six Inches square at the
        Fire-place, you are out of proportion, and can never do rightly
        as to the point of heat; for if you cause it (if above that
        proportion) to stream with flame, the heat will be too big: And
        if it stream not, it will not be big enough, or very hardly. </p>
      <p>Fifthly, Let the top of your Furnace be closed to an hole which
        may but just serve for casting in of Coals about three Inches
        Diameter or Square, which will keep down the heat powerfully. </p>
      <p><i>Rule</i> XIII. </p>
      <p>These things thus ordered, set in your Glass with your matter,
        and give Fire as Nature requires, easie, not too violent;
        beginning there where Nature left. Now know, that Nature hath
        left your Materials in the Mineral Kingdom; therefore though we
        take comparison from Vegetables and Animals; Yet you must
        understand a Parallel in the Kingdom, in which the Subject you
        would handle is placed: As for Instance, if I should Analogize,
        between the Generation of a Man, and the Vegetation of a
        Vegetable, you must not understand, as though the heat for one,
        were to be measured by the other; for as we know, that in the
        ground Vegetables will grow, which is not without heat, which
        they in the earth feel, even in the beginning of the Spring; yet
        would not an Egg be hatched in that heat, nor could a man feel
        any warmth, but rather to him a numbing cold. </p>
      <p>Since then you know that your work appertains all to the
        mineral Kingdom; you must know what heat is fit for Mineral
        Bodies, and may be called a gentle heat, and what violent;
        First, now consider, where Nature leaves you, not only in the
        Mineral Kingdom, but in it to work on Gold and <i>Mercury</i>,
        which are both incombustible: Yet <i>Mercury</i> being tender,
        will break all Vessels, if the Fire be over extreme; Therefore
        though it be incombustible, and so no Fire can hurt it, yet also
        it must be kept with the Male Sperm in one Glass, which if the
        Fire be too big, cannot be, and by consequence the work cannot
        be accomplished. So then from the degree of heat that will keep
        Lead or Tin constantly molten, and higher, so high as the Glass
        will endure without danger of breaking, is a temperate heat; and
        so you begin your degrees of heat according to the Kingdom in
        which Nature hath left you. </p>
      <p>As then the highest degree of heat which the root of a tree
        feels in the bowels of the earth; is not by far comparable to
        the lowest degree of heat an Animal hath; So the highest degree
        of heat a Vegetable will endure without burning, is too low for
        the first degree of Mineral heat as to our Work. </p>
      <p><i>Rule</i> XIV. </p>
      <p>Know, that all your progress in this Work is to ascend in <i>Bus



          &amp; Nubi</i>, from the Moon up to the Sun; that is in <i>Nubibus</i>,
        or in <i>Clouds</i>: Therefore I charge thee to sublime in a
        continual vapour, that the Stone may take Air, and live. </p>
      <p><i>Rule</i> XV. </p>
      <p>Nor is this enough, but for to attain our permanent Tincture,
        the water of our Lake must be boyled with the Ashes of <i>Hermes


          Tree</i>; I charge thee then to boyl night and day without
        ceasing, that in the troubles of the stormy Sea, the Heavenly
        Nature may ascend, the Earthly descend. </p>
      <p>For verily, if we did not Boyl, we would never name our work
        Decoction, but Digestion; For where the Spirits only Circulate
        silently, and the Compound below moves not by an Ebullition,
        that is only properly to be named Digestion. </p>
      <p><i>Rule</i> XVI. </p>
      <p>Be not over hasty, expecting Harvest too soon, or the end soon
        after the beginning: For if thou be patiently supported, in the
        space of fifty days at the farthest, thou shalt see the Crows
        Bill. </p>
      <p>Many (saith the Philosophers) do imagine our Solution to be an
        easie work; but how hard it is, they can only tell, who have
        tried and made Experience: Seest thou not a Grain of Corn, sow
        it, and after three days thou shalt only see it swell’d; which
        being dry’d, is the Corn it was before: Yet thou canst not say
        it was not cast into its due matrix; for the earth is its true
        place, but only it wanted its due time to Vegetate. </p>
      <p>But things of an harder Kernel lie in the ground a far longer
        time, as Nuts and Plum Stones, for each thing hath its season;
        And this is a true sign of a natural Operation, that it stays
        its season, and is not Precipitate: Dost think then, that Gold
        the most solid body in the world? will change its Form in a
        short time; Nay, thou must wait and wait until about the 40th
        day utter blackness begins to appear; when thou seest that, then
        conclude thy Body is destroy’d, that is, made a living Soul, and
        thy Spirit is dead, that is Coagulated with the Body; but till
        this sign of Blackness, both the Gold and the mercury retain
        their Forms and Natures. </p>
      <p><i>Rule</i> XVII. </p>
      <p>Beware that thy Fire go not out, no not for a moment, so as to
        let thy Matter be cold, for so Ruine of the Work will certainly
        follow. </p>
      <p>By what has bee said, thou mayst gather, that all our work is
        nothing else but an uncessant boyling of thy Compound in the
        first degree of liquefying heat, which is found in the Metalline
        Kingdom, in which the Internal Vapours shall go round about thy
        matter, in which fume it shall both die, and be revived. </p>
      <p><i>Rule</i> XVIII. </p>
      <p>Know, that when the White appears, which will be about the end
        of Five Months, that then the accomplishment of the white Stone
        approacheth; Rejoyce then, for now the King hath overcome Death,
        and is rising in the East with great Glory. </p>
      <p><i>Rule</i> XIX. </p>
      <p>Then continue your Fire until the Colours appear again, then at
        last you shall see the fair Vermillion, the Red Poppy; Glorify
        God then, and be thankful. </p>
      <p><i>Rule</i> XX. </p>
      <p>Lastly, you must boyl this Stone in the same water, in the same
        proportion, with the same Regimen (only your Fire shall then be
        a little slacker) and so you shall increase Quantity and
        Goodness at your pleasure. </p>
      <p><i>Now the only God the Father of light, bring you to see this
          regeneration of the light, and make to rejoice with him for
          ever hereafter in light.</i> Amen. </p>

      </p>
      <p>To pass over his Prologue which is Adhoratory to the desirously
        studious of this Art, and the beginning of the Preface, which is
        his Address to God who is the only Giver of Wisdom, to bestow
        upon him true Understanding, that he might lead his sinful Life
        to the glory of him, being over-swayed from what he was
        naturally, by him who is the Fountain of all Goodness; I shall
        take up his pattern for a Precedent rather of Imitation, than a
        Subject of Exposition. </p>
      <p>And first, as touching those who shall bend themselves to this
        Science; Let them resolve that they undertake a most admirable
        piece of Work, in which (though far be it that I should thing
        that God bestows upon any of us what we enjoy for our own
        Merits, but of his free Grace, yet withal) let me exhort any one
        who shall set his Studies this way, to address himself to the
        Author and Fountain of Goodness for his help, that he may have
        grace to honour God in the use of so great a Talent: For I
        perswade my self, that whomever God shall appoint to be Heir of
        such a Talent, that he will give him a heart to improve it
        aright; or else he will add to his Judgment for the abuse of so
        great a Blessing. </p>
      <p>For whoever shall be wanton and dissolute, and live without the
        fear of God, what may he not do with such an Art? Unless God
        restrain him, as certainly he will, hiding this Secret from him
        or making it to him a snare and trap to betray his Life into the
        hands of covetous men of the World, as many have found it by sad
        experience. Therefore the Lord give both me and thee that grace,
        that he may be continually before our Eyes, the Alpha and Omega
        of our Thoughts, Words and Actions: Even so Amen. </p>
      <p><i>In the Beginning, when thou madest all of nought, a globous
          matter, and dark, under confusion, by him the beginning,
          &amp;c.</i> </p>
      <p>First then cast thine Eyes upon the Works of God, and behold
        that work of his hands: Consider how the glorious work of
        Creation was begun by him, even by Christ, for whose sake this
        very Science is communicated unto the Sons of Men, as <i>Bernardus


          Trevisan</i> witnesseth, who in his epistle to <i>Thomas of
          Bononia</i>, saith of this work, That it is done (<i>Christi
          Gratia</i>) for Christs sake. </p>
      <p>Consider how out of one Mass the Lord God by his powerful
        Command made all things to appear that are in heaven or in
        earth; the heavenly Bodies with their Influences above, and the
        earthly Matter below; which by the Rotation of the Heavens
        produce all sublunary products, through the Word of his Mouth. </p>
      <p>Above all which and in all which God is, he is the Maker and
        the Lord of all above all, blessed for ever, who hath purchased
        to himself a People, and redeemed them, and they shall reign
        with him for ever and ever. </p>
      <p><i>For as of one Mass was made all things right so in our
          practice must it be.</i> </p>
      <p>Apply all this to the work of this Mastery Analogically and
        Allegorically: for as the Lord made all the works which we see,
        so he did lay them all under his powerful word of Command, by
        which they continue to be what they are, and are carried with an
        uniform motion to that first Pattern or Draught of things. </p>
      <p><i>All our Secrets of one Image must spring.</i> </p>
      <p>As then out of one mixed confused Mass all things had an actual
        existence according to their several kinds, so out of one Image
        all these Secrets must out of one Image all these Secrets must
        flow: Truth doth not consist in Heterogeneity, but in Unity; for
        God is one, and his works uniform; and the more Noble any thing
        is, the nearer to Simplicity. </p>
      <p><i>As in Philosophers Books, whoso list to see.</i> </p>
      <p>To this the Sentences of the Philosophers concur, as many as
        have truly understood the <i>Secret</i>, as <i>Morien</i>
        often and plentifully witnesseth, <i>Geber, Trevisan</i>, and
        many others: The thing is but one in kind, though two in number;
        and though more things are used, yet till they be all brought to
        an oneness of Nature, they are not fit to enter into this work.
      </p>
      <p><i>Our Stone is called the Lesser World.</i> </p>
      <p>And therefore our <i>Stone</i> is resembled to Man, who
        although he have a Wife different for him in Sex, yet one with
        him in kind; in which sence it is called the <i>Microcosm</i>,
        or Less World: for indeed, next to Man, who is the Image of God,
        it is the true little System of the Great World: I shall not
        particularize here now, for in its place it will fall in
        seasonably. </p>
      <p><i>One and Three.</i> </p>
      <p>This <i>Stone</i> is also called <i>Trine</i> or <i>Trinity
          in Unity</i>, from the Homogeneity of the Matter, as <i>Trevisan</i>
        saith: Our <i>Stone</i> is made of one Root, that is, of two
        Mercurial Substances, <i>&amp;c</i>. This <i>Trinity</i> is
        discerned in the Components; for first there is the Body, which
        is Sol, and the Water of <i>Mercury</i>, in which besides its
        Mercuriality there is a spiritual seed of <i>Sulphur</i>, which
        is the secret Fire. This is the <i>Trinity</i>, these are
        called the Body, the Soul, and the Spirit; the Body is the dead
        Earth, which increaseth not without the celestial Vertue; the
        Spirit is the Soul of our Air or Chameleon, which is also of a
        two-fold composure, yet made one inseparably; the Soul is the
        Bond of <i>Mercury</i>, without which our Fire never appears,
        nor can appear, for it is naked, it inhabits the <i>Fiery-Dragon</i>,
        and it yields his Soul to the true <i>Saturnia</i>, and is
        embraced by it, and both become one together, bearing the stamp
        of the most High, even the Oriental <i>Lucifer</i>, the Son of
        the Morning: This Soul is <i>Chalyb’s</i> Magical Volatile, and
        very tender, the true Minera of <i>Sol</i>, out of which <i>Sol</i>
        naturally proceeds, which I my self know to be true, and have
        spoken of it in my little Latin Treatise, called <i>Introitus
          apertus ad occlusum Regis palatium</i>: This is the true <i>Sulphur</i>,
        which is imbibed by the Mercuriality of <i>Saturnia</i>, and
        notes it with the Regal Signet, and being united and revived
        into a Mineral Water by the mediation of <i>Diana’s Doves</i>,
        it is the sharp Spirit which in the Water moves the Body to
        putrefie. Thus is the <i>Trinity</i> proportionable, to wit,
        three Natures in the first Mixture, the Work is carried an end
        to perfect Complement distinctly, according to the Vertue of a
        Body, Soul, and Spirit: for the Body would be never penetrative,
        were it not for the <i>Spirit</i>, nor would the <i>Spirit</i>
        be permanent in its super-perfect Tincture, were it not for the
        Body; nor could these two act one upon another without the Soul,
        for the <i>Spirit</i> is, an invisible thing, nor doth it ever
        appear without another Garment, which Garment is the Soul. In
        this it exerciseth its vertue: this <i>Soul</i>, as it is drawn
        from the <i>Saturnia</i>, solid and dry, is named our Air, or
        rather the Chameleon, which is an airy Body, changing its hue
        according to every Object it beholds, so our Air is of an
        astonishing Nature, out of which I know all Metals may be drawn,
        yea even <i>Sol</i> and <i>Luna</i>, without the Transmuting
        Elixir, of which in my little Latine Treatise (which was the
        Congest of mine own experience) I spake fully. </p>
      <p>This Air being dissolved into Water Mineral, hath in it two of
        our <i>Trinity</i> united so really that in a short digestion
        the spiritual inhabiting invisible <i>Sulphur</i> will without
        addition congeal the <i>Mercury</i> in which it is, and make a
        visible congelated substance of <i>Luna</i> and then Sol. </p>
      <p>Thus this <i>Trinity</i> is indeed <i>Unity</i>, one being
        Gold mature, fixt, and digested in act, the other Gold volatile,
        white, and crude, yet&nbsp; (<i>in posse</i>) to be made most
        fixt and solid by naked digestion. It is not then a delusion
        that Philosophers speak and write, for trust me (<i>Viderunt
          nudam sine veste Dianam, sciens loquor</i>) I know I speak
        true, which the Sons of Art do know, and can testifie with me. </p>
      <p><i>Magnesia also.</i> </p>
      <p>This <i>Stone</i> is by the Philosophers called their <i>Magnesia</i>,
        their <i>Adrop</i>,<i> &amp;c</i>. with many more names, and is
        indeed their Stone in the first true mixture of the true matter;
        for it is the true seed, and will produce, with the co-operation
        of external Fire, in a patient expectation of the time of
        nature, which is not long to him that understands it. </p>
      <p><i>Of Sulphur and Mercury.</i> </p>
      <p>For that which is done by Nature in many years and ages, in the
        bowels of the Earth, decocting <i>Mercury</i> alone, without
        addition; Art, to make the work short, first impregnates <i>Mercury</i>
        with a spiritual seed of <i>Sulphur</i>, by which it becomes
        powerful in the dissolution of Metals, and then adds to it
        mature <i>Sulphur</i>, by which the work is shortened; and out
        of these two Parents of one Root is brought forth a Noble Son of
        a Regal Off-spring, that is not simply Gold, but our <i>Elixir</i>,
        then thousand times more precious. </p>
      <p><i>Proportionate by Nature most perfectly.</i> </p>
      <p>Yet all this Work of the Artist is only to help Nature; we can
        do no more, yea we have professed and will profess, that we do
        only administer unto Nature herein: for all the Works of God are
        intire, we can but behold them and admire them; and therefore we
        seek our Principals where Nature is, and amend Nature in its own
        Nature. Nor do we make the simple believe, which is the Trade of
        Sophisters, that we by our Extractions and Manual Operations
        upon Vegetables, Minerals, urines, Hair, or the like, intend to
        make our so highly prized Elixir; but out of such things in
        which Nature hath put it, we by Art do make it appear by
        revealing what was hidden, and hiding what was manifest. </p>
      <p><i>But many one marvelleth, and marvel may, and museth on such
          a marvelous thing.</i> </p>
      <p>Whereas those who work upon other matters than the true, do
        betray their ignorance herein most foully, that they do not
        consider the possibility of Nature, but work after their Fancy;
        as though out of combustible substances filthy in their nature,
        and made up of heterogeneities, might be produc’d a pure perfect
        Metallick Substance, by reason of its unseverable Unity
        invincible, and by vertue of it transcendent Excellency
        cleansing and fixing all leporous and fugitive bodies in the
        Mineral Kingdom, and reducing them to the Anatical proportion of
        perfectly digested <i>Sol</i> or <i>Luna</i>, according to the
        quality of the Medicine. When therefore their Principles are not
        found, their Conclusion is always deceitful, and then they not
        knowing Nature in her Operation, but interpreting the words of
        the crafty and envious Philosophers, according to the Letter, do
        stand admiring at the Unconformity of their Work to the Promises
        of the Philosophers, at least they understand their Books; they
        admire what this Stone is, if it be a Truth, or a Conceit; and
        why they (as well as any) do not attain it if possible: Such
        meditations usually fill the minds of unsuccessful Alchymists,
        who though they be (as they esteeme themselves) very Judicious,
        yet cannot stumble upon this unhappy <i>Stone</i>. </p>
      <p><i>What is our Stone, &amp;c.</i> </p>
      <p>They marvel at the uncouth difficulty of the thing, n or can
        they almost tell what to judge of what they read; forasmuch as
        all Philosophers say it is a very easie thing. </p>
      <p><i>For Fowls and Fishes to us do it bring, every Man it hath:
          And it is in every place, in thee, in me, &amp;c.</i> </p>
      <p>And in very deed the Antient Wise Men have so written, and do
        still write the same; as to wit, That it is found in a Dunghill,
        according to Morien, and for the easiness of the charge, they
        all write plentifully; so that in respect of time and cost, <i>Artephius</i>
        and <i>Flammel</i> say it is but the play of Children and work
        of Women; and therefore one Excellent Philosopher, writing of
        this Mastery, titles his Treatise, <i>Ludus Puerorum</i>; that
        is, Childrens Play. </p>
      <p><i>To this I answer, That Mercury it is I wis.</i> </p>
      <p>Yet trust me, though the wise men thus write, and it be true,
        there is notwithstanding something to be added to their
        Sentence, according as the author of <i>Novum Lumen</i> well
        observed, as namely, That this Art is easie to him that
        understands it, as <i>Artephius</i> plainly expresseth; but to
        him that is ignorant of it, there is nothing can appear so hard;
        <i>The Wise Man</i>, saith <i>Sendivogius, finds it in a
          Dunghill, but the Fool cannot believe that it is in Gold</i>.
        I for my part (through the great mercy of God to me an unworthy
        and unthankful Creature) I know the Art to be true, but not that
        only, but also very easie; and I wonder that men of so great
        parts have studied it so long in vain; only this I am confident
        of; it is the gift of God; nor is it <i>in him that willeth,
          nor in him that runneth, but in God that giveth mercy</i>: In
        which respect I am bold, to the glory of God, to confess that I
        have the Art, and have Natures Operation in these so hidden
        Secrets, before mine eyes at this present writing, which I see
        hourly with admiration of the infinite Glory, in the beholding
        of such a great Glory in the Creatures, which, trust me, will
        ravish the Beholder, to see such a despised Infant as our <i>Mercury</i>
        is, to grow into so strong a <i>Heroe</i>, which the World
        cannot purchase. </p>
      <p><i>But not the Common, called Quick-silver by name.</i> </p>
      <p>Yet the difficulty is not over when once it is known that the
        whole Secret consisteth&nbsp; in <i>Mercury</i>; for what more
        frequent among the Sophisters than to cry, <i>Our Mercury,
          &amp;c</i>. and yet in the Work of Nature they are as blind as
        Moles? The cause is, for that Nature hath produced a Mineral
        Juice in the bowels of the Earth, which doth answer to most of
        the Philosophical Descriptions of their Water; as namely, that
        it is mineral, quick, current, without humectation, ponderous,
        and the like; which when the vulgar Alchymists read, they apply
        it, to this naughty <i>Mercury</i>, which for inward Qualities
        hath nothing in it like ours. </p>
      <p>Some there are, who trusting to the Sentence of most of the
        Wise Men who have written concerning this Art, do reject <i>Mercury</i>
        vulgar in word, when as indeed they dote as much upon it as
        others, whenas by their mock-purgations they handle <i>Mercuries</i>
        divers ways by Sublimation, Precipitation, Calcination Manual,
        even to a black substance, like to Soot or Lamp-black, by
        distillation from sundry <i>Faeces</i>, after grinding with
        Vinegar, by Calcination with Waters-fort, by Lotions
        innumerable, changing <i>Mercury</i> into sundry forms, and
        after quickening him: By all which Operations they imagine
        themselves secure of the Secret of our <i>Mercury</i>, whenas
        all such ways indeed are but Sophisms; and yet <i>Mercury</i>
        so abused is one and the same vulgar <i>Mercury</i>. </p>
      <p>So that upon this Rock more have stumbled than upon any other,
        &amp; yet will stumble, till they know how to distinguish our <i>Mercury</i>
        from Common, and our preparations from that of the vulgar
        Sophisters, which have no likeness one to another. </p>
      <p><i>But Mercury, without which nothing being is.</i> </p>
      <p>For our <i>Mercury</i> is Essential and Radical to our Body,
        and partakes of the nature of it intirely, and therefore it is
        said to be that <i>Mercury</i> without which nothing is; for
        all things are distinguished by Philosophers by three Principles
        (although some Simples have not three, but only by Analogy)
        among which the most essential is <i>Mercury</i>, for the
        humidity of all things concrete is called their <i>Mercury</i>,
        which is most intire to all things, forasmuch as all things owe
        their beginning unto Water. </p>
      <p>So then as the proper specifick <i>Mercury</i> of all things
        is so Essential unto them that nothing is without it, so our
        Mercury is so co-substantial with our Body, that it is one in
        kind with that <i>Mercury</i> of which it was by coagulation
        concrete, which vulgar <i>Mercury</i> is not, and therefore the
        Body is incrudate by this <i>Mercury</i>, and sends forth its
        Seed by mixture with it, through the co-operation of requisite
        temperate external heat. </p>
      <p><i>All Philosophers record and truly fain the same.</i> </p>
      <p>Truly this I could confirm by infinite Testimonies of
        Philosophers, since there never wrote any who was indeed a true
        Artist, but he hath affirmed the same: <i>Geber, Artephius,
          Haly, Rotinus, Flammel, Sendivogius</i>, the Author of the
        Rosary, <i>Trevisan</i>, with many others, which would be very
        tedious to name. </p>
      <p>So that indeed this Work of mine I wrote not because enough
        hath not been written before; for I do but echo to the Voice of
        all Philosophers, who have left upon record such clear
        Testimonies of the co-operation of Art and Nature herein, that
        if Wit were capable of this attainment, the Art would have been
        common ere now; and I do verily admiringly adore the Wisdom of
        God herein, that an Art so true, so natural, so easie, so much
        desired and sought after, should yet be so rarely found, that
        the generality of Men, Learned and Unlearned, do laugh at it as
        a Fable: it is therefore most certainly the Gift of God, who is
        and ever will be the Dispenser of it, according to his good
        pleasure. </p>
      <p><i>But simple Searchers putteth them in blame, saying they hid
          it.</i> </p>
      <p>Most injurious are they therefore to the well-deserving
        Philosophers, who because they cannot understand their Writings,
        and through the mis-understanding of the possibility of Nature,
        do commit foul mistakes in their operations, and therefore reap
        a ridiculous Harvest, they then blame the falsity of Authors, or
        at least accuse their difficult writing, not considering that
        Philosophers owe them nothing, and whatever they write for the
        information of the studious, is not of debt, nor yet of
        Covetousness, for they possess the greatest Treasure in the
        World; nor lastly of Ambition, for many suppress their names: it
        is of Love, therefore, and of desire to be helpful to the
        Studious; which Love to requite with reproaches, is a token of
        great ingratitude. </p>
      <p>Moreover, it is to be understood that the most wise GOD hath a
        ruling hand herein, and all Sons of Art have their Commission as
        it were given them; they write and teach according to that
        permission which the Creator of all things hath given them. I
        may speak it experimentally, that when my self have had one
        intent, I have been so over-swayed with unpremeditated thoughts
        I the very writing, that I have taken notice of the immediate
        hand of God therein, by which I have been carried beyond what I
        intended. </p>
      <p>And truly it is not our intent to make the Art common to all
        kind of men, we write to the deserving only; intending our Books
        to be but as Way-marks to such as shall travel in these paths of
        Nature, and we do what we may to shut out the unworthy: Yet so
        plainly we write, that as many as God hath appointed to this
        Mastery shall certainly understand us, and have cause to be
        thankful unto us for our faithfulness herein. This we shall
        receive from the Sons of this Science, whatever we have from
        others: therefore our Books are intended for the former, we do
        not write a word to the latter. </p>
      <p><i>But they be blame-worthy which be no Clerks, and meddle with
          Philosophy.</i> </p>
      <p>Moreover, we write not our Books for the information of the
        illiterate, as though any vulgar mechanick Distiller, Alchymist,
        or Sophister, should readily carry away the Golden Fleece; or as
        though any covetous man, who makes Gain his utmost end, should
        readily gather the Apples of the <i>Hesperides</i>; nor yet
        that any, though learned, should by once or twice overly and
        slight reading (as the Dogs lap the Water of <i>Nilus</i>)
        straight-way be made a Philosopher: Nay verily, the majesty of
        this Science forbids so great impiety; it is the gift of God,
        and not of Men: Our Books are for those who have been or intend
        to be conversant about the search of nature; we hint the way;
        prayer to God and patient persisting in the use of means, must
        open the Doors. Let therefore profound Meditation, accompanied
        with the Blessing of God, Furnaces, Coals, Glasses, and
        indefatigable pains, be thy Interpreters, and let them serve for
        Commentaries upon our Writings. So I did, so I advise thee; and
        the Blessing of God attend all studios virtuous Searchers in
        this way. </p>
      <p><i>But though it Mercury be.</i> </p>
      <p>Yet is not the knot untied, nor difficulties overcome, when
        once a man hath learned to sing this thredbare Song in
        Philosophy, <i>Est in Mercurio quiequid quaerunt sapientes</i>:
        for what <i>Sophister</i> who cannot make so great a clatter in
        these general terms as a son of Art? The greatest difficulty is
        to know what this <i>Mercury</i> is, that is so desirable and
        effectual. </p>
      <p><i>Yet wisely understand wherein it is, and where thou shalt it
          seek.</i> </p>
      <p>Therefore let me advise every studious Searcher of this hid <i>Science</i>,
        to consider warily with himself what he seeks and would find;
        nor that only, but in what he would find it: for trust me it is
        not in this <i>Science</i> as some do imagine, that our <i>Arcanum</i>
        may be made out of anything, nor yet out of any bare thing: But
        in the knowing of the true Principle, consists the first true
        step to Perfection, according to the Poet, <i>Dimidium facti
          qui bene coepit habet</i>. </p>
      <p><i>Else I counsel thee take not this work in hand.</i> </p>
      <p>But he who knows not this our Ocean in which our Water hath its
        flux and reflux, and our Fountain out of which he may draw this
        Water for his use, let him forbear this, as a most dangerous <i>Science</i>,
        for he may only expect loss in it, but no profit. </p>
      <p><i>For Philosophers flatter Fools with Faire speech.</i> </p>
      <p>Nor let any expect comfortable Direction in our Books, who know
        not the true Matter, nor the true Keys by which our matter is
        brought forth from darkness into the light; for verily though we
        write for the inlightning of a son of Art, yet also for the
        fatal blinding of all such Owls and Bats who cannot behold the
        light of the Sun, nor can induce the splendor of our Moon. To
        such we propound rare tricks, suiting to their sordid fancy: to
        the covetous, an easie way without expence, in an inconsiderable
        time; to the lazy Book-men, a play, without tedious toil; to the
        unstable, rash, hasty multiplicity of Distillations. </p>
      <p><i>But listen to me, for truly I will thee teach.</i> </p>
      <p>But to thee, supposing thy qualifications to be Honesty,
        Secrecie, Studiousness and Indefatigableness, we will shew the
        Truth; yet so, that it may be hid from the Vulgar, yet plain
        enough to an industrious attentive Header. </p>
      <p><i>Which is this Mercury most profitable.</i> </p>
      <p>Philosophers have hidden much under the <i>Homonymium</i> of <i>Mercury</i>,
        so that it is no hard matter for those that peruse their Books
        to mistake them; yea as many as God will have excluded from this
        Art, shall certainly mistake. </p>
      <p>For many things are by them named by the name of <i>Mercury</i>,
        which are altogether useless in this mastery, and many Processes
        have they deciphered which themselves never did. I for my part
        shall not tread in their metaphorical steps, but shall herein
        candidly follow the path of profound <i>Ripley</i>, whose Text
        I annex to my Discourse as I go, because it is an elaborate
        Piece, I excellent method; on whom I do not merely comment, for
        I write mine own experimental Knowledge, but rather intend this
        Treatise for a Light to that excellent Light in Alchymy; these
        Labours of mine being intire of themselves; Only to help thee to
        my utmost, I have confined my Discourse to his Method, which I
        might (as other Philosophers have done) have scattered here and
        there confusedly. </p>
      <p><i>Being to thee nothing deceivable.</i> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;As then I have chosen <i>Ripley</i>’s Method to follow,
        so will I imitate his Ingenuity, and do solemnly profess not to
        be deceivable to thee in any thing, though I shall not so unfold
        the Mysteries, that bare reading shall suffice to shew the
        unveiled <i>Diana</i>. </p>
      <p>Know therefore assuredly, that when the Philosophers say, That
        their Matter is everywhere, <i>&amp;c.</i> This they speak only
        fo the blinding of all such who taking the Philosophers meaning
        according to the bare sound of their words, do reap Trifles
        instead of Treasures. I shall therefore let you understand that
        this subject of the Philosophers is considered either in
        reference to its Matter, or formal Vertue; in reference to the
        former, it is a concrete of Water, as all other Compounds are;
        in respect of the latter, it participates of a Celestial Virtue,
        and that in a high degree in both respects. It is said to be in
        every place: for the original matter, which is Water, passeth
        equally through the whole Family of Concretes: and for the
        celestial Influence, it is so universal that nothing is hidden
        from the heat of it: so that indeed in this sence it is said to
        be every where. Moreover, the <i>Stone</i> being the <i>System</i>
        of the great World, doth in some way or other represent
        everything which is or can be perceived by man; I mean in
        reference to some or other operation, colour or quality, and
        therefore the Wise have described it almost by all things
        imaginable, for to everything in some or other circumstance it
        hath resemblance. </p>
      <p><i>It is more near in some things than in some.</i> </p>
      <p>Yet to speak properly for information, and not to conceal the
        Secret, we profess that there is but one kind in which our <i>Stone</i>
        is found, and in number two: understand me not as the
        Philosopher finds things in his first laborious preparation, for
        so one of the two subjects which being of one kind enter the
        supernatural work of Generation of our fiery <i>Stone</i>, I
        say our crude Sperm flows from a Trinity of Substances in one
        Essence, of which two are extracted out of the earth of their
        Nativity by the third, and then become a milky Virgin-like
        Nature, drawn fro the <i>Menstruum</i> of our sordid Whore. </p>
      <p><i>Take heed therefore what I to thee write.</i> </p>
      <p>And now I call God to witness that I will shew you a great
        Mystery: our Stone is in some part of a perfect nature, which we
        would exalt into a more than most perfect, and for this end we
        stand in need of our true Fountain, which I have elsewhere
        described, and shall not now repeat: This Fountain hath three
        Springs, and these are three Witnesses which testifie to the
        Artist of the truth of his proceedings; these are the Spirit,
        the Water, and the Blood, and these three agree in one; the
        Water is a Mercurial Bond, which the Sophisters can behold so
        far as the outward shell reacheth, but the wise man can behold
        his hidden secret Centre: the Blood is of our <i>Green Lyon</i>,
        which is indeed the greenest or rawest of the three: for it hath
        no manner of Metalline <i>Sulphur</i>, no not a grain, and
        therefore is <i>Totally Volatile</i>, and it is more raw than
        common Water, and yet it is called the Blood, for a most secret
        reason, because it is the seat of his Life; yea the Spirit by
        this Soul of our <i>Green Lyon</i>, is made manifest, and is
        united to it, so that though it be very green or unripe, yet
        that inhabits it, which is both pure and ripe, and can and will
        digest with the Water, and make both become life with life: Now
        the Spirit is nothing else but a Chaos, the Wonder of the
        Wonders of God, which every man almost hath, and knows it not,
        because as it appears to the World it is compact in a vile
        despised form; yet is it so useful, that in humane Affairs none
        can want it: to the Philosopher it appears united to the Blood,
        that is, of our <i>Green Lyon</i>, which truly is not a Lyon
        till the spirit be joined with it, and then it is made able to
        devour all Creatures of its kind. </p>
      <p>And these three agree in one, they are not absolutely one, mark
        that; our Fire is not of the matter, and yet it is united with
        the matter, as if it were of one form with it; and there is an
        agreement in one, though not a radical union; for the spirit
        (which is Fire) is separated from the Water and the Blood; and
        then is our Lyon actually Green, but ceaseth then to be our
        Lyon, but is the true matter to multiply Emeraulds more glorious
        than natural. </p>
      <p><i>For if to thee Knowledge never come,</i> <br>
        <i>Therefore yet shalt thou me not twite.</i> </p>
      <p>And now indeed if any be ignorant, let him be ignorant; I know
        not what more to say, and not transgress the silence of <i>Pythagoras</i>.
        I have told you that our matter is two-fold, crude and fixed;
        the fixed is by Nature perfected to our hands, and we need only
        to have it made more then most perfect, which Nature alone could
        never perform; nor is there any thing that can thus exalt
        Tinctures, but our dissolving Water, which I told you floweth
        from three Springs; the one is a common Well at which all draw,
        and of which Water many use; this Well hath in it a Saturnine
        drossiness, which make to Waters unuseful; these frigid
        superfluities are purged by two other Springs, through which the
        Water of this Well is artificially caused to run: these Springs
        make but one Well, whose Waters appear dry, the humidity being
        sealed; the Well it self is surrounded by an Arsenical Wall, the
        slimy bottom abounds with the First <i>Ens</i> of Mineral <i>Salt</i>
        and <i>Sulphur</i>, which acuate the Water of the first Well,
        whose primary quality is Coldness; being thus actuated, it
        becomes so powerful a <i>Menstruum</i>, and so pleasant to the
        Metals, that for its peculiar Vertue it is chosen for to be the
        Bath of the Sun and Moon. </p>
      <p><i>For I will truly now thee excite to understand well
          Mercuries three.</i> </p>
      <p>But because one Book never is sufficient in this Mastery, to
        discover all that is to be known, and other Authors write
        variously of <i>Mercury</i>: Attend further what I have to say
        to thee concerning this point. </p>
      <p>We have in our work properly three <i>Mercuries</i>, of which
        one is to be by the Philosopher prepared, of which I have
        spoken; and this being joynd with the perfect body, and set to
        digest, the Glass is shut, and then in this first Composition is
        the Matter called <i>Rebis</i>. That is, (two things) to wit in
        Number, for you may yet separate each from other in its intire
        nature. </p>
      <p>These two being joined, do operate so within the Vessel till
        the Compound become a black Powder, which then called the Ashes
        of the Platter. </p>
      <p>This Powder relenteth into a black Broth, which is called <i>Elixir</i>,
        or Water extracted by Elixation, which reiterate Liquefaction. </p>
      <p>This Elixir is divided into a more subtile part, which is
        called <i>Azoth</i>, and the grosser part is called <i>Laton</i>,
        which is by <i>Azoth</i> washed and whitened. </p>
      <p>In <i>Rebis</i> the matters are confused, in Elixir they are
        divided, and in <i>Azoth</i> they are conjoined with an
        inseparable union. </p>
      <p><i>The Keys which of this Science be.</i> </p>
      <p>These <i>Menstruums</i> or <i>Mercuries</i> are the very Keys
        of this Science: the first is the Philosophers Key, the other
        two are Natures Keys. </p>
      <p><i>Raymund his Menstrues doth them call.</i> </p>
      <p>They are called by the wise men <i>Menstrues</i>, in three
        respects: first for the secresie of them; as those Lunary
        Tributes of Women are hid from common view, so these <i>Mercuries</i>
        from vulgar Searchers. Secondly for the Prognosticks of them; as
        those in Women betoken maturity to conceive, so these are called
        <i>Menstrues</i> because they are fit for procreation. Thirdly
        in regard of the office of them; as those in Women are accounted
        nutritive for the Embrion, so our Child is nourished by these to
        perfect age and strength. </p>
      <p>Let me add a fourth reason, and that is, in respect of the
        time; the Philosophical preparation will hardly give thee thy
        first <i>Menstruum</i> fit for thy use in less than a month.
        And after conjunction thy first <i>Menstruum</i> will begin to
        hold of the nature of the Body in another month, and then thou
        shalt see a show of the second <i>Menstruum</i>; but wait till
        another month, and thou shalt see thy second <i>Menstruum</i>
        compleat; then yet wait a third month, and thou shalt see a show
        of the third <i>Menstruum</i>, which in the fourth month will
        perfectly exuberate, and then with it thou shalt soon see
        perfected <i>Sulphur</i> of Nature, for it is Fire of Nature;
        and in this first Exaltation is the white Stone perfected. </p>
      <p><i>Without them truly no Truth is done.</i> </p>
      <p>He then that knoweth not the Secret of our <i>Menstruals</i>,
        let him forbear the practice of the <br>
        Work, for verily he may expect nothing but a sophistical
        Delusion instead of the true Work of Nature: He is like a man
        that would enter an inaccessible Castle without a Key, or shoot
        in a Bow without a string. </p>
      <p><i>But two of them be superficial.</i> </p>
      <p>Now that you may know our Secrets exactly, we shall faithfully
        discover unto you our Experience, as cordially as a Brother may
        declare to a Brother; and shall reveal what I never found yet
        revealed in any Author. </p>
      <p>Here are in our <i>Mercury</i> three Mercurial Substances,
        which may well be called <i>Menstrues</i>, the one the more
        gross part (which though it be a Water, yet it being the most
        palpable part, and visible, may be termed the Body of the Water:
        the last is a Fiery Form, which is the Blood of <i>Cadmus</i>;
        this is a real invisible form, which is essentially and formally
        <i>Sol Volatile</i>: the second is the mean Soul, which
        Philosophers without equivocation call <i>Saturn</i>’s Child;
        the middle substance of these three, are made into one wonderful
        <i>Mercury</i>, which hath not its like in the world. </p>
      <p>Now for the superficiality of the two first <i>Menstrues</i>
        or <i>Mercuries</i>, and the essentiality of the third, know
        and understand, for our speech will be very mysterious: Know I
        say, what it is to be superficial, and what essential: Essence
        you know is invisible, and more formal then material, which doth
        actuate the matter, and ripens it; but that which is superficial
        is visible, and may be seen, and is more material and passive:
        Now those two first are superficial, are the Water and the
        Blood, the essential <i>Menstrue</i> is the Spirit, which all
        are in one; yet distinguished in number, though not in kind. </p>
      <p><i>The third Essenital to Sun and Moon</i> </p>
      <p>So then two are material passive substances, which are united
        in our sophical <i>Mercury</i>; the third is an active essence
        which is hid in our <i>Mercury</i>, which is essential to Sun
        and Moon, because it is a Fire, wic is <i>Sol</i> volatile; and
        as the Artist may govern this <i>Mercury</i>, it will digest
        the passive Principles either into <i>Sol</i> or <i>Luna</i>,
        at the Philosophers pleasure. </p>
      <p><i>Their Properties&nbsp; I will declare right soon.</i> </p>
      <p>I shall by and by in its place describe to you all the
        Properties of these three <i>Menstrues</i>, when I come to it;
        in the mean time take notice that by this <i>Mercury</i> in
        which are three <i>Mercuries</i>, or <i>Menstrues</i>, the
        perfect Bodies will be calcined, and then dissolved into <i>Mercury</i>,
        which is not then so properly called a <i>Menstrue</i>, for it
        is the Fruit it self, called <i>Azoth</i>, or Virgins Milk;
        which is a digestion beyond the <i>Menstrues</i>. </p>
      <p><i>And Mercury of Metals essential,</i> <br>
        <i>Is the Principle of our Stone material.</i> </p>
      <p>The Bodies when they are dissolved do transmute the foresaid <i>Mercuries</i>
        by their own ferment, into their own nature, for the Fire of
        Nature assimilates all that nourisheth it to its own likeness;
        and then our <i>Mercury</i> or <i>Menstrue</i> vanisheth, that
        is, it is swallowed up in the Solary Nature, and all together
        make but one universal mercury, by intimate union, and this <i>Mercury</i>
        is the material Principle of the Stone; for before our <i>Mercury</i>
        (as it was compounded of three <i>Mercuries</i>) had in it two
        which were superficial, and the third essential to Sol and Luna
        only, not to the Stone: for Nature would produce these two out
        of it, by artificial decoction: but when the perfect Bodies are
        dissolved, they transmute the <i>Mercury</i> (that dissolved
        it) and then there is no more repugnancy in it, then there is no
        longer a distinction between superficial and essential, but all
        is become essential; And this is that one matter of the Stone,
        that one thing which is the subject of all Wonders. </p>
      <p><i>In Sol and Luna our Menstrues are not seen.</i> </p>
      <p>When thou art come to this, then shalt thou no more discern a
        distinction between the Dissolver and the Dissolved; for the
        Water shall neither ascend nor descend, go out nor in alone, but
        the Fire of nature shall accompany it, and the colour of the
        mature Sulphur, which is unseparably joined, shall tincture thy
        Water. </p>
      <p><i>It appeareth not but by effect to sight.</i> </p>
      <p>So that thou shalt never see them severed one from the other,
        but shalt discern them by the effect, and by the eye of the mind
        more then of thy body: Therefore saith the Philosopher, <i>Azoth</i>
        and Fire are sufficient for then in the middle and end, but not
        in the beginning, for then they are not our <i>Mercury</i>,
        that is our universally united <i>Mercury</i>. But in the first
        days of the Stone, there appear four Elements, of which three
        are in the <i>Mercury</i> sublimed, and one in <i>Sol</i>,
        which is counted all for Earth till it be dissolved, and then it
        fermenteth the <i>Mercury</i>, and makes the three qualities of
        it, which it hath, drawn from three substances to unite into one
        <i>Mercury</i> which hath all in it one essential property, and
        that is Solary, which first will shew the Moon in the full and
        is the true one matter of all our Secrets, our one Image out of
        which springs white and red, not bare <i>Sol</i> and <i>Luna</i>,
        as will spring out of our <i>Mercury</i>, which we prepare with
        our hands, but the white and red Elixirs, which shew that this <i>Mercury</i>
        which Nature hath made in the Glass, without our help, is far
        beyond that <i>Mercury</i> which we prepared with a laborious
        toil. </p>
      <p><i>This is the Stone of which we mean,</i> <br>
        <i>Who so our Writing conceiveth aright.</i> </p>
      <p>And verily he that hath well studied our Books shall understand
        that this general one <i>Mercury</i> which we call <i>Azoth</i>,
        is indeed our <i>Stone</i>, which wanteth only digestion, for
        it is inseparably united, not in a Dyptative Conjunction, which
        is barely a mixture of the Sun with our <i>Mercury</i>; or
        Triptative, which is a mixture and union of the Body, Soul, and
        Spirit, which is before Putrefaction; but Tetraptive, which is
        the Anatization of qualities, which is the first degree of the
        white Stone, which will then grow higher and higher, till the
        Moon come up to the full. </p>
      <p><i>It is a Soul and Substance bright.</i> </p>
      <p>This Stone or Virtue multiplicative is not in relation to the
        matter, but the form, which doth make the matter to receive and
        after impress Tinctures: for who could believe that <i>Sol</i>,
        in which the virtue is but unary, I mean only sufficient for
        itself, should by the addition of our <i>Mercury</i>, which in
        reference to its material parts, is below the degree of <i>Sol</i>,
        and needs digestion, and that only to maturate it to the height
        of <i>Sol</i>, I say that by the mixture of those two Venerial
        Tinctures, should be multiplied in a manner infinitely. </p>
      <p><i>Of Sol and Luna a subtile Influence.</i> </p>
      <p>Were it not that this Tincture which in the <i>Mercury</i> is
        <i>Sol</i> and <i>Luna</i>, were as a Soul, that is, a
        spiritual thing, it were impossible; it is therefore the very <i>Dos


          faecunditatis</i> which is in Minerals (which doth appear in
        their Lunary and Solary Tinctures) which was put and planted on
        and in them, in the first Benediction of (<i>Crescite &amp;
          Multiplicamni</i>) which increasing is in some things <i>juxta



          quantitatem</i>: This is in quality. </p>
      <p><i>Whereby the earth receiveth resplendence.</i> </p>
      <p>So then the matter of Minerals is a dead passive thing, in
        which there is included a Light, which is cloathed (<i>vitali
          Aura aetheria</i>) as I may speak; this form of Light is it
        which doth actuate and specificate or determine the matter; and
        this splendor or Light is in all Metals, <i>Sol</i> or <i>Luna</i>,
        which are conspicuous more eminently in those two perfect Bodies
        <i>Gold</i> and <i>Silver</i>, but are in other Mineral Bodies
        more clouded and Eclipsed with an earthly faeculent
        interposition between the fulgor and the superfluities, which is
        the Imperfection of such Bodies; and is accompanied with a
        rawness and inconstancy in the <i>Fire</i>, the Impure carrying
        away the Pure. </p>
      <p><i>For what is Sol and Luna, saith Avicen,</i> <br>
        <i>But earth which is pure White &amp; Red?</i> </p>
      <p>So then <i>Sol</i> and <i>Luna</i> is more formal then
        material; for the mater is a gross Terrene Substance, but the
        form of Light purifying the Substance, is a most subtile
        spiritual thing which doth ennoble the grossness of the matter
        by a Fire-abiding Tincture. </p>
      <p><i>Take from it the Said Clearness, and then</i> <br>
        <i>That Earth will stand but in little stead.</i> </p>
      <p>But if this Tincture could be separated from the <i>pondus</i>
        of the matter, the remainder would be an unprofitable
        Terrestriety: Our work therefore is for to advance this Light by
        exaltation in the matter; which as it in its simplicity is but
        in unity, so it may be brought to a Virtue millenary, and
        gradually is exalted, that the matter would seem to be quite
        swallowed up of the form; and yet in this exaltation it is not
        the <i>moles</i> or <i>pondus</i> that is the Solary or Lunary
        Virtue, but a Light whose multiplication is not in the increase
        of <i>pondus</i>, but in the circulation of Natures; till the
        Heavenly illuminate the Earthly with an immediate Beam, all
        interposition being removed out of the way. </p>
      <p><i>The whole Compound is called our Lead</i> </p>
      <p>For to attain this admirable multiplication Philosophers have
        found out a most subtile yet very natural Cosmposition, which
        hath been not a little sought for by many: this the wise
        Antients, both to describe the Fountain of these Mysteries, as
        also to hide the Secret from the unworthy, have mystically
        called their Lead. </p>
      <p><i>The quality of Clearness from Sol and Luna doth come.</i> </p>
      <p>This Lead, so called from the appearing baseness of its
        original, is notwithstanding of an admirable power, for it
        contains the Bath for <i>Sol</i> and <i>Luna</i>; that is, the
        <i>Sun</i> and <i>Moon</i> enter into it, and send out their
        Tinctures into it, which it receiveth, and like to a fertile
        Soil ennobleth it an hundred and an hundred fold. </p>
      <p><i>These are our Menstrues, both all and some.</i> </p>
      <p>Thus have I in general given you a description of our <i>Menstrues</i>,
        which are three, <i>Acetum, Elixir</i>, and <i>Azoth</i>;
        which I shall now particularly describe. </p>
      <p><i>Bodies with the first we Calcine naturally perfect.</i> </p>
      <p>The first <i>Menstrue</i> we call our sharp Vinegar, with
        infinite other names, which it will be tedious to recite, and
        with this is made our Magical Solution of Sol; this, saith <i>Sendivogius</i>,
        is (<i>Menstruum mundi in sphera Lunae toties rectificatum ut
          posit calcinare Solem</i>.) In this, saith the noble Author of
        the Hermetical <i>Arcanum</i>, is made <i>Eclipsis Solis &amp;
          Lunae in Cauda Draconis</i>: this is, as <i>Artephius</i>
        saith, the only Instrument in the World for our Art: for it
        causeth the Sun to putrefie; that is, it loseth its hard
        compaction, and makes it to be an impalpable Powder, as saith
        the truth-telling Flammel. In this Calcination, as all Authors
        testifie, and our own Experience hath taught us, Natures are
        united, Colours are mingled, and one holds of the other, and
        this is the period of the first <i>Menstruum</i>, which ends in
        this Circulation. </p>
      <p><i>But none which been unclean.</i> </p>
      <p>This Blackness many erroneously conceive to be uncleanness, but
        it is not so, for it is only the Sepulcher of our King; in
        which, though he seem to have lost what he was, yet from hence
        he shall arise what he never was before </p>
      <p><i>Except one.</i> </p>
      <p>And verily there is nothing of an unclean nature that entreth
        our Composition except one thing, which is the Instrument moving
        the <i>Gold</i> to putrifie; and in regard that it doth
        naturally incline the Body to putrifie, and is as it were the
        very grave of it, it is called by some Philosophers <i>Aqua
          foetida</i>, and by some <i>Mortis Immundities</i>; yet
        indeed it is not in is own nature unclean, but made pure, as
        pure as the Art of the Artist can make it with the help of
        Nature, joining Consanquinity with Consanquinity. </p>
      <p><i>Which is usually</i> <br>
        <i>Named by Philosophers their Lyon Green.</i> </p>
      <p>This hidden body, or rather Chaos, the Philosophers have highly
        extolled and deeply concealed, but they usually call it their <i>Green



          Lyon</i>, which many mistaking apply to <i>Venus</i>, and
        some to <i>Vitriol</i>, which is all one in manner, <i>Vitriol</i>
        being only Copper corroded by an embryonated Salt; but Fools,
        saith <i>Ripley</i> (in his Errors) call it the <i>Green Lyon</i>.
        I shall discover this Subject to you, so far as I dare, in this
        following Song. </p>

        <i>Been hedged so on every side with briars,</i> <br>
        <i>That few could pluck it at their hears desires.</i> <br>
        <i>There is a substance of Metalline Race,</i> <br>
        <i>If you the matter view, whose louring face</i> <br>
        <i>A Sophister would at first sight so scare,</i> <br>
        <i>That he it to approach would never dare;</i> <br>
        <i>The form that’s visible is very vile,</i> <br>
        <i>And doth Metalline Bodies so defile,</i> <br>
        <i>That none to see it could be brought to think</i> <br>
        <i>That thence should spring bright Phoebus Pearly Drink:</i> <br>
        <i>And yet, O strange! A wonder to relate,</i> <br>
        <i>At this same Spring naked Diana sat.</i> <br>
        <i>Who horn’d Acteon for his ventrous peeping,</i> <br>
        <i>This Spring two dreadful Bests have in their keeping;</i> <br>
        <i>Which drive away rash Searchers to their rue,</i> <br>
        <i>Them to inchant, the Art who do not know.</i> <br>
        <i>Yet further for to answer your desire,</i> <br>
        <i>I say this subject never felt the fire</i> <br>
        <i>Of Sulphur Metalline, but is more crude</i> <br>
        <i>Then any Mineral, which doth delude</i> <br>
        <i>Th’ unwary, and in Fire fugitive</i> <br>
        <i>‘Tis found th’ impure away the pure doth drive;</i> <br>
        <i>&nbsp;And its Components are, A Mercury</i> <br>
        <i>Most pure, though tender, with a Sulphur dry</i> <br>
        <i>Incarcerate, which doth the flux detain.</i> <br>
        <i>This Sulphur with malignant qualities</i> <br>
        <i>Doth so the Mercury infect which with it lies</i> <br>
        <i>That though they have no fundamental union,</i> <br>
        <i>Yet hereby is debarr’d the sweet communion</i> <br>
        <i>Which otherwise would surely intercede</i> <br>
        <i>Between the Virgin-Nymph, which we call Lead</i> <br>
        <i>And her dear Sister which in Silver streams</i> <br>
        <i>Runs down abundantly, then should the beams</i> <br>
        <i>Of bright Apollo cause the Dews which fall</i> <br>
        <i>From these commixed Waters, from the tall</i> <br>
        <i>Aspiring Mountains, gliding through the Vales,</i> <br>
        <i>Fire to conceive of nature, which avails</i> <br>
        <i>To warm the Bath for Sol, in which he may</i> <br>
        <i>Descend and wash, and with fair Phebe play,</i> <br>
        <i>Till flesh and youth renewing, they be able</i> <br>
        <i>To shine with glory, aye multiplicable.</i> <br>
        <i>Know then this Subject, which the sure Base</i> <br>
        <i>Of all our Secrets is, and it uncase;</i> <br>
        <i>And chuse what thou shalt find of greatest price,</i> <br>
        <i>Leave Sophisters, and follow my advice:</i> <br>
        <i>Be not deluded, for the truth is one,</i> <br>
        <i>‘Tis not in many things, this is our Stone.</i> <br>
        <i>At first appearing in a Garb defil’d,</i> <br>
        <i>And to deal plainly, it is Saturn’s Child,</i> <br>
        <i>His price is mean, his venom very great,</i> <br>
        <i>His constitution cold, devoid of heat.</i> <br>
        <i>Although ‘tis mixed with a Sulphur, yet</i> <br>
        <i>This Sulphur is combustible, to get</i> <br>
        <i>Another Sulphur Metalline and pure,</i> <br>
        <i>And mix with the Mercurial part be sure.</i> <br>
        <i>This Sulphur in the House of Aries seek,</i> <br>
        <i>There shall you find it, and this is the Greek</i> <br>
        <i>Alcides, which with Jason Journey took</i> <br>
        <i>To Colchos, this is it which never Book</i> <br>
        <i>As yet reveal’d, and yet I will proceed,</i> <br>
        <i>And greater Mysteries unfold with speed.</i> <br>
        <i>Our Subject it is no ways malleable,</i> <br>
        <i>It is Metalline, and its colour sable,</i> <br>
        <i>With intermixed Argent, which in veins</i> <br>
        <i>The sable Field with glittering Braches stains.</i> <br>
        <i>The pure parts from the impure, thou shalt never</i> <br>
        <i>With Fire or Water for this work dissever.</i> <br>
        <i>Nor with the hardest iron dig it thence,</i> <br>
        <i>For Steel ‘gainst this affordeth no defence.</i> <br>
        <i>So easily as any little Boy</i> <br>
        <i>A Giant can suppress, this can destroy</i> <br>
        <i>Alcides Brest-plate, with his Target stout,</i> <br>
        <i>And put opposing Armies to the rout</i> <br>
        <i>Of Swords and Spears, O wondrous force, and yet</i> <br>
        <i>The Sages this have seen, when they did sit</i> <br>
        <i>In Council, how this Fury they might tame,</i> <br>
        <i>Which (as unparallel’d) they then did name</i> <br>
        <i>Their Lyon Green, they suffered him to prey</i> <br>
        <i>On Cadmus Sociates, and when the fray</i> <br>
        <i>Was over, they with Dian’s Charms him ty’d</i> <br>
        <i>And made him under Waters to abide,</i> <br>
        <i>And wash’d him clean, and after gave him Wings</i> <br>
        <i>To fly, much like a Dragon, whose sharp Springs</i> <br>
        <i>Of fiery Water th’ only way was found</i> <br>
        <i>To cause Apollo his harp-strings to sound.</i> <br>
        <i>This is the true Nymphs bath, which we did try,</i> <br>
        <i>And prov’d to be the Wise Mens Mercury.</i> </p>
      <p>In this Song you have the <i>Lyon Green</i> so described, that
        more I dare not, more I cannot, unless I should pen you down the
        Receipt <i>verbatim</i>, which God and Reason forbids. </p>
      <p><i>He is the mean the Sun and Moon between,</i> <br>
        <i>Of joining Tinctures with perfectness.</i> </p>
      <p>Learn then to know this <i>Green Lyon</i> and its preparation,
        which is all in all in the Art, it is the only know, untie it,
        and you are as good as a Master; for whatever then remains is
        but to know the outward Regimen of Fire, for to help on Natures
        internal Work. </p>
      <p><i>As Geber thereunto beareth witness.</i> </p>
      <p>Moreover be not various, seeking that in many things which is
        verily but in one thing; for in all the world there is not any
        one subject but this: <i>Ripley</i>, after the Rehearsal of all
        his Errors, tells you, That he never saw true Work but one: And
        <i>Geber, Exacte (inquit) singula sumus experti, idque probates
          rationibus &amp; nihil invenimus praeter solum unctusam
          huiditatem penetrantem &amp; tingentem, &amp;c</i>. And <i>Artephius</i>
        saith, There is no other subject in the World for this Art,
        naming it, although in a Philosophick manner, wonderous
        subtilly. I counsel the, with <i>Ripley</i>, to learn to know
        this one thing which I have faithfully declared, and I know what
        I have declared experimentally to be true: He that understands
        me will have cause to thank God and me for what Light I have
        given to <i>Ripley</i>: He that with me understands <i>Ripley</i>
        will easily discern. </p>
      <p><i>With the second which is an humidity</i> <br>
        <i>Vegetable reviving what earst was dead.</i> </p>
      <p>Our second Water, or <i>Menstruum</i>, or Fire, is our Elixir,
        which is an Elixation of our Matters, or drawing forth the
        Tincture out of our dissolved Bodies; which doth cause out dead
        Body to rise, and to spring forth in Sprigs and Branches, like
        to the tender Grass in the Spring out of the Field; and this so
        long until an intire Triptative Union be made of Body, Soul and
        Spirit. In this operation our Body of the Sun hath its dead
        moles turned into a living quick active Spirit, and our Compound
        after death begins to sprout, and to shew its true Vegetative
        nature, it is indowed with a green Colour, which is the sign of
        the growth of all things. </p>
      <p><i>Both Principles Material must loosed be.</i> </p>
      <p>Here your Natures are changed, and hold one of another, and
        become one inseparably; that is, the Solary Nature is not to be
        divided from the <i>Mercury</i>, nor the Fire from the Water,
        but with one the other is always moved; and so though there yet
        be a <i>superius</i> and an <i>inferius</i>, an <i>ascendens</i>
        and <i>subsidens</i>, yet now <i>quad est superius est ficut
          id quod est inferius.</i> </p>
      <p><i>And Formals, else they stand in little stead.</i> </p>
      <p>Now between the two Extreams of <i>Mercury</i> and <i>Sulphur</i>,
        you have a marvelous <i>medium</i> ingendered: now the form of
        <i>Gold</i> is taken quite away, and it hath at present an
        accidental imperfect form, which is the mean through which it
        passeth to its transcendent perfection. </p>
      <p><i>These Menstrue therefore know, I thee reed.</i> </p>
      <p>Labour with all thy might to attain the skill of these two
        first <i>Menstruums</i> Theoretically and Practically; the
        first is to be by thee prepared and proportioned in the
        beginning, before thou attempt any thing. When thou has the true
        Nymphs Bath, then joyn this Spouse with her beloved Husband, and
        see if she will make his Body fall to sunder in impalpable
        Atoms: Then let <i>Saturn</i> be thy Chamberlain, and let him
        gather together these dissevered members, and of them make one
        broth, in which is blackness compleat, after which followeth
        greenness; and then shalt thou know that thy Compound is by the
        living God endowed with a vegetable Soul. </p>
      <p><i>Without the which neither true Calcination</i> <br>
        <i>Done may be, nor true Dissolution.</i> </p>
      <p>He who knoweth not the Mystery of these two <i>Menstrues</i>,
        can never attain either to Calcination or Dissolution of the
        Philosophers: The Mystery of the first consists in the actuating
        of thy Vinegar with the Blood of our <i>Green Lyon</i>, and the
        Soul of the <i>Fiery Dragon</i>, which is by seven <i>Eagles</i>,
        which are seven Cohobations and Depurations of thy feminine
        Sperm, till it conceive a spiritual seed, or true natural heat,
        to animate thy young King. </p>
      <p>The Mystery of the second <i>Menstrue</i> consists in the true
        proportion of thy first Water, with its own Body, and the
        administration of true heat external, by which the combat
        between the <i>Eagles</i> and the <i>Lyon</i> may be stirred
        up; thus shall the Duel be ended, the Lyon rent in pieces, and
        the Carrion of its Carcass shall kill the eagles; and out of
        these Atoms shall the second Water be made apparent by
        Dissolution. </p>
      <p><i>With the third Humidity most permanent.</i> </p>
      <p>The third <i>Menstrue</i> is by Artephius called the second
        Water, for our second he doth joyn together with the first;
        although where he doth particularize the three Fires, he doth
        then distinguish three <i>Menstruums</i>. </p>
      <p>The like course many Philosophers have used in the description
        of their Operations, some omitting the first, or at least
        confounding it with the second, for the greater obscuring of the
        Art. </p>
      <p>But we have beyond what any have hitherto performed)
        particularly insisted upon the three in order, and have taken
        more pains in the discovery of the first, because the wise
        Antients have taken such pains to conceal that most; and after
        that we have made an orderly proceeding to the Second, which we
        have in like sort handled, and this being performed, we do now
        address our selves to the third. </p>
      <p>This is called by <i>Ripley</i> a most permanent Humidity: and
        note by the way, that the first Water is called by Authors a
        permanent Water likewise; but take notice that there is a
        different reason for each denomination; for first of all, all <i>Mercury</i>
        is Water permanent, that is, the parts have no Heterogeneity,
        they will not leave one another in the examen of the Fire, but
        either all flyes and is unconstant, or else all abides and is
        constant in the tryal of <i>Vulcan</i>: and so is our first <i>Menstruum</i>.
        And in this our <i>Mercury</i> and <i>Common Mercury</i>
        agree, besides the identity of matter, for it is the form only
        that distinguisheth them. But in the next place, our Water is
        permanent with the Body, which <i>Common Mercury</i> is not;
        that is, it by digestion doth unite, not only adhere to it, so
        that both together do make one <i>Individuum</i>, which is done
        by our secret Conjunction. But lastly, when the Body is thus by
        our Water reduced, at last it comes that the four Elements are
        united in this Water. After Putrefaction and Purification, which
        is the last most laudable Tetraptive Conjunction, and now the
        Tincture is the Spirit, and the Spirit is the Sol, and the Soul
        is the Body, and all these are one. </p>
      <p><i>Incombustible and unctuous in his Nature.</i> </p>
      <p>This is our true Incombustible Mercury, for it is totally
        purged from all its burning faeculency; <i>Gold</i> though it
        be a pure Metal, in respect of others which are imperfect, yet
        compared with our Stone it hath also its faeces; but this when
        it is taken away by Putrefaction and Ablution, then becomes a
        total separation of what is precious from what is vile, and as
        the Philosopher well saith, In the troubles of this our stormy
        Sea, all that is pure will ascend, and all that is impure
        descend, and will abide in the bottom of the Vessel in the form
        of a combust Earth; then is made the new Heaven and the new
        Earth, pray to God then that thou mayst see when there shall be
        no more Sea. Yet I say before thou hast this final Inceration,
        thou has this most incombustible <i>Menstruum</i>, and most
        permanent, in which nature and Art have conspired and made a
        Purification, beyond what Nature alone could ever have brought
        to pass. </p>
      <p>Therefore this <i>Mercury</i>, though it be liquid and in the
        form of <i>Mercury</i>, it is notwithstanding Unctuous, that
        is, great with Child, which Child is <i>Sulphur</i>, which <i>Sulphur</i>
        it will in the end bring forth, and shall then be sealed up in
        the belly of this Infant, which is when all is fixed, and <i>Mercury</i>
        is then hidden under the fixity of <i>Sulphur</i>. </p>
      <p><i>Hermes Tree unto Ashes is burnt.</i> </p>
      <p>It doth therefore naturally incline it self unto Inceration,
        for Earth is the Burse of our Stone, and in is its virtue
        attained, and its perfection intire, according to noble <i>Hermes</i>
        in his <i>Smaragdine</i> Table; <i>Vis</i> (saith he) <i>ejus
          est integra si versa fuerit in terram</i>. By vertue of this
        third permanent pure incombustible Water, thou shalt at last
        attain a total Inceration; for this Water though it be wholly <i>Mercurial</i>
        to sight, yet hath in it in its own Bowels its own <i>Sulphur</i>,
        nay it is all <i>Sulphur</i>, and that all incombustible. This
        work is called the burning of <i>Hermes</i> Tree to Ashes,
        which is done thrice; first, into a black unctuous Calx, as
        impalpable as Atoms, which are only to be discerned in the
        Sun-beams: secondly, into a fine white Calx, in which is the
        Moon in the full: the third, a red Calx, in which the <i>Sun</i>
        is Orient. Now know that the first Calcination is from the
        vertue of the <i>Sun</i>, in which the <i>Sun</i> seeks to
        rise, but by reason of the equal opposition it finds from the
        water, it is beclouded, and after through the interposition of
        the Earth, totally Eclipsed. </p>
      <p>This Fire therefore, because of the mixture of it with the
        natural Fire of <i>Sol</i>, which is in it dissolved, is called
        unnatural; the first Fire of our Water is called Fire against
        nature, and the Fire of the <i>Sulphur</i> of the perfect Body
        is called Fire of nature. In this operation, through the power
        and will of the Almighty, the Body which hath been so long dead,
        is by this Water quickned, and actually sprouts like to a
        Vegetable; for when the pores of it are opened by the moistening
        of our Water, it straight begins to follow the Spirit upon the
        Fire, the Spirit then doth mount aloft; which the Body thus made
        tender cannot follow, but as the Poet saith,<i> non passibus
          aequis</i>, as a Son that is little followeth his Father. It
        therefore in a token of its friendship with the Water, doth bud
        forth like to the tender Frost upon the surface of the earth,
        and retains a quantity of the Water with it self, occupying a
        middle room between the bottom and the top; in which respects
        the Philosophers have called it their Soul, which to shew its
        union to the Body, riseth no higher then it can have a root or
        Basis below; and to manifest its love to the Spirit, it doth as
        it were climb after it higher and higher for its season, until
        at length it return from whence it came: And verily this Soul is
        the Magnetical <i>Medium</i> between the Spirit and the Body,
        which doth desire the Spirit as its true drink; and therefore as
        it grows dry, it doth attract the greater drops of sweat, which
        falling to the earth, arise in a pleasant fume, and do moisten
        the growing virtue with a pleasant dew, by reason of which it
        grows every day more and more. </p>
      <p>This Tree of ours some have compared to one thing, and some to
        another; some to a Cypress or Fir-Tree, which indeed may seem to
        resemble it; others to Haw-Thorn Trees, as <i>Ripley</i> in his
        <i>Gate of Cibation</i>; others to Shrubs and Bushes, others to
        thick Woods, and in these Woods, saith <i>Lambsprint</i>, there
        is a Beast all over black. I confess there is a similitude
        between our germination, and all these; others, because of the
        Humidity of the Compound, which is ever and anon returning by
        drops, have likened it to a Moorish low Bog, in which Rushes
        grow, and Toads keep; others have called it their Coral, which
        is indeed the fittest comparison, for in our Tree there are
        Shoots and Sprigs, without any thing that may be properly
        likened to Leaves; as then Coral is an union of a Vegetable and
        a Stony nature, so is it in our tree, (for Stones and Minerals
        are of one Imposition) our Tree is Metalline, and yet through
        the power of God it seems to Vegetate. 2ly. Coral grows under
        the water, where one would think no Vegetable could grow; ours
        also grows in a heat which no Vegetable but it self can grow.
        3ly. Coral hath many Sprigs and Branches without Leaves; so is
        our tree. 4ly. Coral as it is under water hath a most exquisite
        biting taste, which in the Air it quickly loseth; so our Stone,
        or Tree Metalline, in its place is of a pontique fiery nature,
        but taken out, it in a short space loseth the same
        irrecoverably. 5ly. There are five sorts of Coral, the common
        Gray, the Milk White, the green, the Bloud Red, and the Black;
        so our Tree is at his periods all of these colours, and in this
        form, which Tree by the heat of the Fire is dryed to a Calx,
        which is called the Ashes of Hermes Tree. Lastly, Coral is more
        heavy then any other Vegetable; and so is our tree beyond all
        Vegetables, yea and Coral it self, in ponderosity. It was not
        therefore a fortuitous comparison that Philosophers named their
        Mastery the Tree of the <i>Hesperides</i>, nor is it in vain
        that they bring in <i>Jason</i> pouring Broth at the Root of it
        to attain the mastery; for verily the wise Philosopher (noted by
        Jason) so governing his Fire, that the Lunaria or Water of the <i>Moon</i>
        may return to the Earth in which these Trees grow, the Earth
        will at length be so dryed by the heat of the Sun, that it shall
        afford the Tree no more moisture; then shall the Tree it self be
        calcined by the prevailing heat, into a Powder impalpable, first
        black, then white, then red. Therefore is our little Glass by <i>Flammel</i>
        in his Summary named the <i>Philosophers Garden</i>, in which
        the <i>Sun</i> riseth and setteth, and the Philosophers Tree is
        moistned with the dew of Heaven day and night without
        intermission. </p>
      <p><i>It is our natural Fire most sure.</i> </p>
      <p>This <i>Mercury</i> drawn out of the <i>Sun</i> is the true
        natural heat, in the actuating and stirring up of which is the
        whole Secret of the Mastery; this is the honoured Salt, when
        this is made to appear thy operations will be so admirable, that
        they will take up thy whole worldly content, and with their
        variety the time will seem so short, that thou wilt not take
        notice of any tediousness in the passing of it. </p>
      <p><i>Our Mercury, our Sulphur, our Tincture pure.</i> </p>
      <p>This is our <i>Mercury</i>, which cannot be attained with
        money, which is nothing but <i>Sulphur</i>, and <i>Sulphur</i>
        which is nothing but tincture, in which all Elements are
        proportioned perfectly. </p>
      <p><i>Our Soul, our Stone born up with wind,</i> <br>
        <i>In the Earth ingendred. Bear this in mind.</i> </p>
      <p>This is our Body, which is now become all Soul and all Spirit,
        all the pure parts are separated now totally from the
        uncleanness of the dead; it is our Stone, though it be as yet
        volatile, yet it hath all in it essential to our Stone, and
        therefore though it fly and sublime for the space of seven
        times, yet his Nurse is the earth, and therefore to it as to its
        Nest it returns, and in seven sublimations what was before all
        Heaven, will now become all Earth. And this is the period of all
        Rotations, and Natures consummation. </p>
      <p><i>This Stone also tell thee I dare,</i> <br>
        <i>Is the vapour of Metals potential.</i> </p>
      <p>And now if any should demand of us what our Stone is, we shall
        answer him, that it is <i>Gold</i> digested to its height of
        purity and perfection, through the co-operation of Art and
        Nature; but the means to get this, is to learn to turn thy Body
        into a vapour, that is, into <i>Mercury</i>, which then ascends
        in form of a vapour. </p>
      <p><i>How thou shalt get it thou must beware,</i> <br>
        <i>For Invisible truly is this menstrual.</i> <br>
        <i>Howbeit with the second Water Philosophical,</i> <br>
        <i>By separation of Elements it may appear</i> <br>
        <i>To sight in form of Water clear.</i> </p>
      <p>But the means to attain this is not a light work, it requires a
        profound meditation, for this is the Seed of Gold, (which as the
        Poet said, <i>recula resedit longius</i>) it is involved in
        many links, and held Prisoner as it were in a deep Dungeon; so
        that as the noble <i>Sandivow</i> hath it, it is the work of a
        very wise Philosopher to let loose <i>Sulphur</i>; he that
        knows not our two first <i>Menstruals</i>, is altogether shut
        out from attaining to the sight of this third and last <i>Menstrue</i>;
        yet he who knows how to prepare the first Water, and to joyn it
        to the Body in a just <i>pondus</i>, to shut it up in its
        Vessel Philosophically, until the Infant be formed, and what is
        the greatest of all, to govern his Fire dexterously, so as to
        cherish Internal heat with External, and can wait with patience
        till he see his signs, he shall see the first Water will work on
        the Body till it hath opened the pores, and extracted partly the
        Tincture of <i>Sol</i>, which as it comes out gradually, so it
        contests with the first Fire against Nature, so long till they
        be reconciled in an imperfect <i>medium</i>; in which they,
        like to weary wounded Combatants, lye gasping and panting for
        breath, and at length dye; and then appears the second Water of
        the wise, which doth ascend and descend so long till it revive
        the dead Carkass, and then a soul comes into it, and it
        vegetates and circulates, and changeth colours so long, till
        Blackness vanishing there be made a perfect union and universal
        temperament of Elemental qualities, never more to contend
        together: then the whole Compound for a time appears like to a
        new glorious Water, glittering like Oriental Pearls, and
        Fish-eyes. </p>
      <p><i>Of this Menstrue by labour exuberate,</i> <br>
        <i>With it may be made Sulphur of Nature.</i> </p>
      <p>This is it which <i>Raymund</i> calls his <i>Mercury</i>
        exuberate, as much as to say, <i>Mercury</i> with Child; <i>Artephius</i>
        calleth it, the Salt pregnant, for it hath <i>Sulphur</i>
        actually hidden under the <i>Mercurial</i> quickness; therefore
        it by digestion is easily turned into our Stone, which is <i>Sulphur</i>,
        or Fire of Nature. </p>
      <p><i>If it be well and kindly acuate,</i> <br>
        <i>And circulate into a Spirit pure,</i> <br>
        <i>Then to dissolve thou must be sure</i> <br>
        <i>Thy base with it in divers wise,</i> <br>
        <i>As thou shalt know by thy practise,</i> <br>
        <i>That point, &amp;c.</i> </p>
      <p>This <i>Mercury</i> thus renovate or new born, may by the
        Philosopher be diversly handled; for he may take his work from
        the Fire, and circulate and cohobate this <i>Mercury</i> by a
        peculiar operation, which partly Mechanical, till he have a most
        admirable pure subtile Spirit, in which he may dissolve Pearls
        and all Gems, and multiply them or his Red Stone, before it be
        united with a metal in projection for the making of <i>Aurum
          Potabile</i>. And in this <i>Mercury</i> thus circulated, is
        doubtless the Mystery of the never-fading Light, which I have
        actually seen, but yet not practically made. In a word, every
        one who hath this exuberate <i>Mercury</i>, hath indeed at
        command the subject of wonders, which he may imploy himself many
        ways in both admirably and pleasantly. And certainly he that
        hath this, needs no information from another; himself now
        standing in the Centre, he may easily view the Circumference,
        and then operation will be, next to the Spirit of God, his best
        Guide. Know then, that if thou be a Son of Art, when thou art
        once arrived hither, thou are so far from being at the end of
        thy search, (unless thou make <i>Gold</i> to be thy final
        object, and so thou shalt never come hither) that thou art but
        now come into the Mystical School of the hidden wonders of God,
        in which thou mayst every day see new Miracles, if thou be
        studious and desirous of knowledge, which all <i>Adepti</i>
        are; they prize skill before any earthly thing, and therefore
        refuse Honour and Pomp, and retire only to the behoulding of God
        and his Works, in this admirable Looking-glass of the most
        hidden Mysteries of Nature. </p>
      <p><i>For so together they may be circulate,</i> <br>
        <i>That is, the base oyl and vegetable Menstrual,</i> <br>
        <i>So that it be by labour exuberate,</i> <br>
        <i>And made by craft a Stone celestial.</i> </p>
      <p>Yet doth not wisdom come naked, but with her she brings the
        riches and length of days; for this exuberate <i>Mercury</i> is
        an hermaphrodite, and may without taking our of the glass be
        circulated into a fifth Essence. </p>
      <p>Now the union between the two Principles, is the very true
        cause of this circulation, for though in this last <i>Menstruum</i>
        there is an inseparable oneness, yet the Components do give each
        their most noble quality to exalt the transcendency of our
        Medicine. The extreme Components of this third <i>Menstruum</i>,
        are the <i>Sulphur</i> and <i>Mercuriality</i> of the second;
        as the first <i>Menstrue</i>, and <i>Sol</i> our Body, were
        the extremes of the Second. The base oyl, our <i>Sulphur</i> is
        called, for he is the unctuous Dragon, or Earth which lyes at
        bottom without wings, and is the Basis as it were of the Work.
        The <i>Mercury</i> is called Vegetable, for that it flyes and
        returns, and makes the earth to sprout and bud with tender
        branches. These two (the base oyl or <i>Sulphur</i>, and the
        vegetable <i>Menstrue</i>) at last make one intire indivisible
        substance, which is of an Hermaphroditical quality, the man is
        the Woman, and the Woman the Man; the <i>Sulphur</i> the <i>Mercury</i>,
        and the <i>Mercury</i> is the <i>Sulphur</i>; in this respect
        the Earth flyeth as if it were Heaven, and at length the Heaven
        will precipitate in the form of Earth, and then is our work at
        an end, there is the Harvest in the South, when the glorified
        Soul is become a spiritual Body, which is called our Stone of
        Paradise. </p>
      <p><i>Of nature so Fiery that we it call,</i> <br>
        <i>Our Basilisk, or our Cockatrice,</i> <br>
        <i>Our great Elixir most of price.</i> <br>
        <i>For as the sight of the Basilisk his object</i> <br>
        <i>Killeth, so slayeth it crude Mercury,</i> <br>
        <i>When thereupon he is project,</i> <br>
        <i>In twinkling of an eye most suddenly.</i> <br>
        <i>That Mercury then reyneth permanently</i> <br>
        <i>All Metals to Gold and Silver perfite,</i> <br>
        <i>Thus guide thy base both red and white.</i> </p>
      <p>This Heavenly earth is true Mineral Fire, which is then
        resembled to the Sun in its Summer Solstice; it is called Venom,
        because it penetrates Metals so wonderfully; it is called our
        Basilisk, our Cockatrice, our <i>Tyrian</i> Poison, though
        indeed it be an excellent Medicine, in which respect it is
        called our incomparable Elixir. But the denomination of Basilisk
        it retains from its sudden operation upon <i>Mercury</i>; for
        it penetrates it in projection, as warm Oyl runs into sinking
        Paper, even to the profundity of it. Let thy <i>Mercury</i>
        therefore be taken as it is crude bought at the Apothecaries,
        and thou shalt set it in a Crucible to the Fire, in such a heat
        as the <i>Mercury</i> may not fume; and when it is so hot that
        it is ready to fly, which you shall discern by a spurtling
        noise, throw upon it of your Medicine as much as will teyne it,
        and you see that in a moment it will enter it, and straightway
        the mercury loseth its flux, and stands congealed. Then it is to
        be melted by a Fire of fusion, and you shall find pure <i>Gold</i>
        or <i>Silver</i>, according to the quality of your Medicine.
        But if you cast your high Elixir in too great a quantity on <i>Mercury</i>,
        you shall find in the Crucible after projection, a brittle mass
        of the quality and colour of the first Medicine, only of a lower
        virtue, which then you may project upon any inferiour Metal, and
        it will transmute it into most perfect. This operation is not
        apparent or to sight, as is the work of Sophisters. But it is
        both inward and outward, for it transmuteth into a perfect
        species, and not only to shew. This is the way of projection
        both of thy white and thy red Quintessences, first to cast them
        upon Sol or Luna, according as thy Medicine is, and after that
        to make projection on <i>Mercury</i> again and again, till you
        find the true extent of the virtue of your Stone. </p>
      <p>Aurum Potabile <i>thus is made,</i> <br>
        <i>Of Gold not commonly calcinate.</i> </p>
      <p>And now I come to the second reward that Wisdom doth bring with
        her, and that is length of days; and here I have transposed some
        few Verses of <i>Ripleys</i> concerning <i>Aurum Potabile</i>,
        that what he saith in this point may be represented in view
        together, method inviting me to it. Some propound the Medicine
        of <i>Aurum Potabile</i> to be Extracted out of <i>Sol</i>
        pure, by corroding with <i>Aqua Regia</i>, and afterward
        levigating it by reiterate Calcination in the Fire, and manual
        Contritions. This Calx so subtilized, some attempt to resolve by
        <i>Menstrues</i> (as they call them) but in vain, there being
        only one <i>Menstruum</i> that hath the power to resolve both
        Gold, and all sublunary Bodies, to their first matter. <i>Paracelsus</i>
        the first Author of this, did name this dissolving Water his
        Alkahest, his <i>Ignis Gehenne</i>, his <i>Corrosivum
          Specificum</i>, with many other names. This Medicine thus made
        of <i>Gold</i> by the Alkahest, as it is Philosophical and
        real, so it is very excellent, and known only to the <i>Adepti</i>.
      </p>
      <p>Yet this is not our great medicine, for this being but a
        resolution of <i>Gold</i> in its unary simplicity, doth afford
        to us only the most exquisite Medicine that is in <i>Gold</i>,
        as it is made and left by Nature, which partly for its simple
        vertue, and partly for its Metallick determination, doth not
        enter our Constitutive Principles, and consequently cannot touch
        or reach long life. </p>
      <p><i>But of our Tincture which will not fade,</i> <br>
        <i>Out of our base drawn by our Menstrue circulate.</i> </p>
      <p>But when as we have by our Art exalted <i>Gold</i> from an
        unary to a millenary perfection, and advanced it from its gross
        corpulency to a Spiritual Tincture, which is unfading, and of
        all Sublunary things the most durable, then out of this so
        glorious and triumphant in an universal virtue, we do make an
        Oyl so called by us, (though it be permiscible by mixture in any
        Liquor) which Oyl is the very Tree of Life, which prevails and
        triumphs over all the miseries in the world. For it is not <i>Metallum</i>,
        but transcending all metalline things: This Tincture is
        extracted out of <i>Gold</i>, not as Tinctures are drawn by the
        <i>Sal Circulatum</i> of <i>Paracelsus</i>, but by an universal
        changing of the Sickness of the Metalline off-spring, into a
        true posture of Health; by which means it is able to heal all
        Metalline Bodies from their Leprosie, and being resolved by its
        own Vegetable Humidity, which is our first <i>Menstrue</i>,
        circulated till the Water have a ferment from the Bodies, and
        the Bodies from the Water, it will give a Spiritual Tincture,
        sparkling like the flame, to taste most sweet, to smell most
        pleasant, the most incomparable Treasure of the whole World. </p>
      <p><i>And for thy first ground principal,</i> <br>
        <i>Understand thy Waters menstrual.</i> </p>
      <p>Now I return to that which went before concerning this
        Medicine, which I passed over in that place, that I might here
        bring it in together; and indeed he who will know this Mystery,
        he must in the first place learn to know his <i>Menstrual</i>
        Waters, for without this knowledge he can never come to this
        Mastery; for without this knowledge he can never come to this
        Mastery; for with the third <i>Menstruum</i>, (counting three
        according to <i>Ripley</i>) or the second Water, (making the
        first and second into one, with <i>Artephius</i>) is this
        fragrant Balsam made: And verily the whole is but Cohobation,
        the first Water being cohobated so long upon the Bodies, till it
        receive from them a quality of natural heat; yet so as that the
        quality of its own Fire, which is corruptive, and so against
        Nature, be mingled in way of action and passion with the natural
        Fire. This makes a Fire innatural, and is the second Water, in
        which colours rise and set frequently, and then by cohobating it
        till Fire of nature have wholly subdued his Adversary, and made
        a perfect peace and union with it. Then all is Fire of nature,
        then the Clouds are featured and the Light appears; and this is
        our third Water, the subject of wonders, which being one alone,
        doth from that time all operations within itself, congealing,
        relenting, calcining, exalting, subliming and fixing all
        Elements, being linked here inviolably to the making up of that
        great <i>Mysterium magnum</i>, which <i>Paracelsus</i>
        described, but knew it not; we both know it, and have seen it,
        and what we do know and have seen, we do faithfully relate. </p>
      <p><i>And when thou hast made Calcination,</i> <br>
        <i>Increasing not wasting moisture radical,</i> <br>
        <i>Until thy base by oft subtilation,</i> <br>
        <i>Will lightly flow as Wax on a Metal.</i> <br>
        <i>Then loose it with thy Vegetable Menstrual,</i> <br>
        <i>Till thou have Oyl thereof in colour bright.</i> </p>
      <p>Therefore labour thou to bring thy <i>Gold</i> to a
        Calcination, not by Corrosives, but by a <i>Mercury</i>, not
        into a Powder red and dry, but into a Calx black and unctuous,
        and multiply moisture by our true Virgins Milk; then circulate
        these Natures together, till they will flow like unto Wax upon a
        Plate of metal, which is the sign of the true Tincture of <i>Luna</i>.
        Continue thy Fire till the fixt again relent of its own accord,
        till the dry become moist again, and till a Soul return; then
        shall thy Tincture proceed forward to a new Germination, and
        shall be indowed with a Vegetative Soul. Govern thy Bath
        sweetly, until thou have a Tincture of Citrine, which is a sign
        that thy Water is now impregnated with the Oyl immarcessible. </p>
      <p><i>Then is that Menstruum visible to sight.</i> </p>
      <p>Then shalt thou discover what before was hidden, and see what
        before was invisible, and shalt say with the Philosopher, O
        Nature, how thou makest <i>Gold</i> volatile that was most
        fixed! Therefore have they passed one into another. </p>
      <p><i>An Oyl is drawn out in the colour of Gold.</i> </p>
      <p>This is our Virgins Milk of the Sun, which is yellow; with this
        and our perfect Tincture, we make our Blessed Oyl, which hath
        not its Peer among all the works of God, next to the Immortal
        Soul of man, the Glass of Tri-unity, the Sabbath of perfection.
        O happy they that attain to it! </p>
      <p><i>Or like thereto out of fine red Lead.</i> </p>
      <p>Yet a <i>succedaneum</i> of this noble medicine is found in
        the loyns of <i>Saturn</i>, in the bowels of our despised
        Infant, which some true and loyal Sons of Nature, through the
        great mercy of God, have attained without knowing our great <i>Arcanum</i>,
        which a man would think marvelous. </p>
      <p>This is our red Lead, our <i>Mercury</i> essencificate and
        coagulated into a chaos of Spiritual Gold, and after dissolved
        into a quintessence as red as Bloud; which because it is made
        out of the very Essential <i>Mercury</i> of our Stone, which is
        our first Water, I shall leave it undiscovered, which otherwise
        (if it might be explained without danger of prostituting the
        other Secret to unworthy people) I would for the good of Mankind
        proclaim it with Trumpets. </p>
      <p><i>Which Raymund said when he was old,</i> <br>
        <i>Much more then Gold would stand in stead.</i> </p>
      <p>This Oyl or Quintessence, this Balsam of Health, we do
        therefore prize for its wonderful virtue, not so much for that
        by means of it Poverty, that great snare, may be avoided, but
        for its wonderful prevailing excellency against all Diseases
        both of body and mind, as witnesseth <i>Lully, Trevisan,
          Artephius</i>, with that excellent Book intituled <i>Aurea
          Hora</i>, or <i>Consurgens Aurora</i>. </p>
      <p><i>For when he was for Age near dead,</i> <br>
        <i>He made thereof Aurum Potabile,</i> <br>
        <i>Which him revived as men might see.</i> </p>
      <p>By vertue of this Quintessence <i>Artephius</i> testifieth,
        that he lived above a thousand years: <i>Flammel</i> also
        recordeth of it, that it triumpheth over all the Miseries of the
        World. <i>Johannes de Laznioro</i> is more bold, and saith,
        that if in the Agony of death a man should taste but a Grain of
        it, all the mortal Pestilence would depart from him. </p>
      <p>Since then this Knowledge is so wonderfully profitable, being
        the very Looking-glass of Nature, the Antidote against Poverty
        and Sickness, and consequently the Cut-throat of Covetousness,
        Pride, Ambition, and such like sordid Affections, who would not
        bestow a little time in the Inquiry of it? In which let me
        assure thee in the very words of <i>Trevisan</i>, the Art is so
        plain, that if it were nakedly described it would be
        contemptible. And yet in vulgar Mechanicks, how frequent is it
        for men to serve seven, eight, yea ten years Apprentiship to
        attain them? And in some that are a little more ingenious, how
        frequently are considerable sums of Money bestowed to boot? Yet
        in this noble art, so far excelling all Humane Sciences as the
        Sun doth a Candle, who will imploy himself with diligence?
        Unless it be some Money-minded Sots, who seek only for riches;
        and yet how soon are even they weary? So that few or none
        persist in their inquiry, save a few Roguish Sophisters who live
        by Cozening; by reason of such the Art is scandalized, and ill
        spoken of: Yet trust me, for I speak knowingly, the Art is both
        true and easie; yea so easie, that if you did see the
        Experiment, you could not believe it. I have not made five wrong
        Experiments in it, before I found the truth, although in some
        particular turnings of the <i>Encheiresis</i>, I erred oft; yet
        so, as I in my error knew my self a Master, and in less then
        full two years and a half, of a vulgar <i>Ignoramus</i>, I
        became a true <i>Adept</i>, and have the Secret through the
        goodness of God. And that this is true, there are those alive
        that can bear witness to this my writing, which I penn’d for the
        sake of the Ingenious, that they may have <i>Ariadne</i>’s
        thread stretched out to guide them; so with the blessing of God
        they shall by their own Experience see and know, that I wrote
        nothing but what the Light of Experience (far beyond all
        imaginary conjectures) hath taught me to be true. </p>
      <p><i>And now my Muse, let it not irksome seem</i> <br>
        <i>To thee of Matures Mysteries to sing,</i> <br>
        <i>Those hidden Mysteries which many deem</i> <br>
        <i>Nought but delusions with them for to bring.</i> <br>
        <i>This is th’ opinion of the Vulgar rude,</i> <br>
        <i>To whom there’s hardly any selcouth thing,</i> <br>
        <i>But seems a Juggling trick, that would delude</i> <br>
        <i>Their fancies with an empty wondering;</i> <br>
        <i>Therefore against it they with thundering words do ring.</i>
      </p>
      <p><i>There is a fiery Stone of Paradise,</i> <br>
        <i>So call’d because of its Celestial hew,</i> <br>
        <i>Named of Ancient years by Sages wise</i> <br>
        <i>Elixir, made of Earth and Heaven new,</i> <br>
        <i>Anatically mixt; strange to relate,</i> <br>
        <i>Sought for by many, but found out by few;</i> <br>
        <i>Above vicissitudes of Nature, and by fate</i> <br>
        <i>Immortal, like a Body fixt to shew,</i> <br>
        <i>Whose penetrative vertue proves a Spirit true.</i> </p>
      <p><i>His property is as the Sages told,</i> <br>
        <i>Metals imperfect (which before would burn)</i> <br>
        <i>Six to transmute into most perfect Gold,</i> <br>
        <i>And five into the finest Silver turn,</i> <br>
        <i>Not equaled by metals of the Mine;</i> <br>
        <i>Which while some seek, they madly seem to spurn</i> <br>
        <i>The pricks, which proves in th’ end a bad design,</i> <br>
        <i>And gives them cause sadly at length to mourn,</i> <br>
        <i>And to bewail their destiny like men forlorn.</i> </p>
      <p><i>For why, they do not well premeditate</i> <br>
        <i>The nature of the thing they would attain;</i> <br>
        <i>The only thirst of Gain doth animate</i> <br>
        <i>These Gold-adoring wretches, who maintain</i> <br>
        <i>Their mad expence with many a cursed lye,</i> <br>
        <i>Nor from false perjury will they refrain:</i> <br>
        <i>Thus they allure fools by flattery,</i> <br>
        <i>To trust their dotage for the hope of gain,</i> <br>
        <i>This last so long, till in the suds they both remain.</i> </p>
      <p><i>Then Covetousness wrangles with Deceit,</i> <br>
        <i>And curses him for all his lewd expence:</i> <br>
        <i>The other being conscious of his cheat,</i> <br>
        <i>With subtle words doth make a sly defence.</i> <br>
        <i>But what is past can never be recall’d,</i> <br>
        <i>This grieves the Churl, who vows for that offence</i> <br>
        <i>He’l have the Jugglers future pranks forestall’d,</i> <br>
        <i>Lays him in Gaol, O monstrous change! From thence</i> <br>
        <i>The great Stone-maker through a Grate doth beg for pence.</i>
      </p>
      <p><i>But he who will a studious Searcher be</i> <br>
        <i>Of truth, let him such Sophisters eschew,</i> <br>
        <i>And if he will but be advis’d by me,</i> <br>
        <i>Of false ways I’le him warn, and shew him true.</i> <br>
        <i>Beg humbly of thy God to be thy guide,</i> <br>

        <i>Thus qualifi’d thou mayst thy Journey never rue.</i> </p>

        <i>Which answer may the painful Chymist’s aims,</i> <br>
        <i>And it perform, which will surpass the thought</i> <br>
        <i>Of the rude Vulgar, who by only sense are taught.</i> </p>
      <p><i>The Wise mens Books with diligence peruse,</i> <br>
        <i>From which, if diligent, thou mayst discern</i> <br>
        <i>What substance ‘tis they for their matter chuse,</i> <br>
        <i>Also their hidden Agent thou mayst learn.</i> <br>
        <i>They tell thee eke what things thou shouldst refuse,</i> <br>

        <i>Thy cost ne labour; also thou mayst earn</i> <br>
        <i>Riches and health, the one to other subaltern</i> </p>
      <p><i>Yet pains and labour see thou do not grudge,</i> <br>

        <i>To sever Corn from Straw I therefore you advise.</i> </p>
      <p><i>And if you please to take me for your Guide,</i> <br>
        <i>I’le you unto a goodly Castle lead,</i> <br>
        <i>A Castle which to hold all proof is try’d,</i> <br>
        <i>So that there’s none within its Walls may tread</i> <br>
        <i>But he who favour’d with special grace,</i> <br>
        <i>No other title any one may plead:</i> <br>
        <i>And she who is Queen-Regent of the place,</i> <br>
        <i>Is Nature call’d, she in Jehovah’s stead</i> <br>
        <i>Doth fit and rule, for she next under God is Head.</i> </p>
      <p><i>This Castle round by force Inexpugnable,</i> <br>
        <i>Whose Composition’s Homogeneal,</i> <br>
        <i>Immortal ever stands, that none is able</i> <br>

        <i>No way to storm it, though we could recall</i> <br>

      <p><i>Twelve Gates it hath, and yet they are but one,</i> <br>
        <i>And these twelve Gates have but one only Lock,</i> <br>
        <i>So that you either open all or none;</i> <br>
        <i>Nor can you force it open with a knock,</i> <br>
        <i>For violence cannot it break insunder,</i> <br>

        <i>It would nothing avail; who so his stock</i> <br>

      <p><i>Calcination is the Purgation of our Stone.</i> </p>
      <p>We have led thee as it were by the hand through many a waste
        Field, and many a Desart and Thicket, and now lift up your eyes
        and behold where you are, and now welcome my Friend into the
        Garden of the Philosophers; here you may behold (like a
        Landskip) a very glorious Castle, walled about with a very high
        wall, and twelve Gates one following another hindering your
        entrance and possession of it at will, one being opened the rest
        open of themselves, and yield to the a far more renowned
        Conquest, then ever <i>Caesar</i> or <i>Alexander</i> won. The
        first Gate is as it were dug hollow into the Earth, and little
        to be seen above the Superficies: view well the Inscription
        which is written over it, which is the words of that Curse which
        God inflicted on <i>Adam</i>, in the day that he fell, <i>Dust
          thou art, and unto Dust thou shalt return</i>. Mark the
        Escutcheon that is set forth upon the Gate, this signifies unto
        thee, that some Great Person is dead within, therefore behold
        the Attendants all stand in Mourning; amongst whom one with this
        verse of <i>Solomon, I am black, but comely, &amp;c.</i> </p>
      <p>This Lady the Sages have called <i>Juno</i>, or the Metallick
        nature, which is indeed very comely, yet black, for why the Sun
        hath shined upon her Another who seems to supply the room of the
        porter, speaks unto you in these words, <i>Nothing entreth
          hither that defileth, or that is unclean</i>. But enough if
        this, we mist not here stand gazing, lest we be taken for Spyes;
        but we will knock for a Guide, who may go along with us; for
        know that this Castle is a Garrison, and must not be viewed
        without a Guide, who may conduct us in and out, and shew us what
        the places are through which we pass. And now he is come, I
        shall acquaint you somewhat of his conditions, that you may know
        how to please him, that that he may be the more willing to go
        along with you in the right way, and not leave you, as he hath
        done others, who when they have attempted this work with good
        success in the knowledge of matters requisite, they
        notwithstanding have fatally erred, not knowing how to please
        their Guide, who hath a humour of his own not to be equalled in
        the World; and if you make him either sullen, or cholerick, you
        had as good give over the enterprise. </p>
      <p>First of all then know, that for his parts he is a very stupid
        Fool, there is none more simple among all his Brethren; yet is
        he most faithful to his Lord, and doth all things for him most
        prudently, ordering all things in the Family very discreetly;
        which I may rather ascribe to a natural instinct, then to any
        quickness of parts. He is very faithful, for that cause he will
        never either ask or answer any question, but goes on silently:
        Nor will he ever go before you, but follow; you must be very
        wary how you lead him, if he can find an opportunity he will
        give you the slip, and leave you to a world of misfortune. By
        his countenance you shall know whether he be pleased or
        displeased; therefore lay bonds on him, that is, shut him close
        where he may not get forth, then go wisely before with heat, and
        ever observe his countenance as he follows; his anger you shall
        know, by redness in his countenance, and his sullenness by his
        lumpish behavior; in his good temper he is indifferent active
        and merry; and so you shall pass on forward, or turn, or go
        back, as you see his countenance and temper inclined. In the
        next place you are to understand, that he was born to be a
        drudge, and is the very Servant unto all his Brethren; and
        hereupon he doth as it were monopolize the whole toyl and task
        of labour to himself, and if you go about to do any thing, he
        will presently take snuff, and will leave you all the work to
        do, and will not do one stroke more. </p>
      <p>Thirdly, he through long custom hath gotten a habit of
        perpetual working, and therefore if you allow him one hours
        respite, he will never work more; for in his Fathers house he
        committed the offence of <i>Cham</i>, and is therefore judged
        to be a Servant of Servants: his body is very tender and naked,
        yet he will have no Cloaths, nor will he endure any
        Consolidation of parts without exception; for in his youth he
        offended with <i>Ruben</i>, and went up to his Fathers Couch,
        and was for that doomed to a perpetual inconstancy, and is as
        unstable as Water. These in general are the qualifications of
        your Guide, and you must address your self to him accordingly,
        or else your labour will be in vain. </p>
      <p><i>Restoring also of his natural heat.</i> <br>
        <i>Of Radical humidity it loseth none,</i> <br>
        <i>Inducing solution into our Stone most meet.</i> </p>
      <p>The first place which you come to, worthy your observation, is
        a large Room flored with black, the Hangings part black, bluish,
        and yellowish, in which, in which you may see a Carcass
        intombed, and very rotten; a Serpent almost dead with cold, laid
        to the fire, and a Fountain still flowing forth to water a Pot
        which is nigh to it, in which is planted an Herb much like to <i>Ros


          solis</i>, only I hath the Root black, the Leaves yellow, with
        bluish veins and black spots in them continually standing in a
        dew, and over it the Sun as in the Solstice, shining in its full
        vigour, and under it a Fire, as it were of <i>Aetna</i> burning
        continually. The Fountain still sends a few small streams of
        Pearly water to the Root of this Herb, which by insensible pores
        ascend and stand like drops discoloured on the Leaves of the
        herb, which seems as though blasted and withering, and yet
        always full of drops, which dropping down again, and rising
        continually, do resolve the Tree into a viscous Juice, which is
        afterwards dried up into a dry dust, yet unctuous to sight, and
        very black. </p>
      <p><i>After Philosophy I you behight.</i> </p>
      <p>Then I lift up mine eyes, and behold I saw <i>Nature</i> as a
        Queen gloriously adorned, sitting upon her Throne, and in her
        hand a fair Book, which was called, <i>Philosophy Restored to
          its Primitive Purity</i>; whom with low submission I did
        obeyance to, and she graciously took notice of me, and gave me
        this Book to eat it up, which I did, and straight-way she had
        another of the same in her hand: Then was my Understanding so
        enlightened, that I did fully apprehend all things which I saw
        and heard; and when I approached any Gate or Door, straightway
        (as though they were acted by a sensitive Spirit) they opened of
        their own accord: And all in the House did fealty to me, and
        said that I was to be honoured as Lord of the place: <i>For</i>,
        say they, <i>the Queen and He are in love united, and she
          moreover hath plighted her troth to him</i>. Then I considered
        with my self, and behold the Book that I had devoured (like a
        Charm) had so commanded my Spirits, that I could think of
        nothing more than the enjoyment of this rare Beauty which I had
        beheld: And while I was full of these thoughts, behold I heard a
        Voice behind me, saying, <i>What wouldest thou in this World?</i>
        I was a little astonished at the Voice, yet boldly answered, <i>Nothing



          but that I might once more see that admirable Perfection which
          once I beheld in a Nymph, which not long since I saw, who with
          seeming affection did salute me, and gave me a Book to eat;
          which when I had eaten, my Intellectuals seemed as though the
          Candle of the Lord had been kindled in them: But since I could
          never see her whom my Heart longs for: Oh that I might only be
          so happy again!</i> Then said the Voice, <i>Thou art happy in
          that thou hast seen her, more happy in that she gave thee that
          Book, which few in an Age attain to; most happy in that thou
          couldest and didst eat it, which every one that hath it cannot
          do: She therefore whom thou seekest for, is gone into her
          retired Solitudes, and as a Legacy hath left the two great
          Treasures, the Treasure of Riches, and the Treasure of Long
          Life.</i> Then said I, <i>Ah Sir, this you tell me if, is
          nothing but an aggravation of my misery; for all the wealth in
          this world I count as a straw in comparison of the enjoyment
          of that most admirable Lady’s presence, whose service I should
          take for a greater happiness, than if were Master of all the
          World besides. If then I may not see her again, my Life will
          be to me a burden, and to what then will Long Life avail?</i>
        Thus I sat bemoaning my self, and I heard a shrill Voice as it
        were close by me, and I looked suddenly, and behold an
        unspeakable Light, in comparison whereof the Sun it self seemed
        dark; and close by me I saw a most secret place, and in it a
        secret Room of Diaphanous matter, and round, and within it this
        lady who I formerly had seen, upon her Throne; and another in
        the person of a King, in most gay Raiment, as if it were a Robe
        of beaten Gold, which reached from his shoulders to the ground,
        and a Crown of pure Gold on his head; and a third person, who
        like a Water-bearer had a Pitcher on his shoulder, and in the
        midst of it there burned as it were a Lamp: The sight was
        excellent, yet I could not be pleased, for that I saw this Lady
        stark naked with this King, so in private; and while I viewed
        the Room, I found it was exquisitely closed on every side, so
        that it seemed as if it were made of one intire piece of
        Crystal. I marveled at what I saw: for the House was but small,
        the Chamber less, and the Closet of Crystal to sight no bigger
        than a small Egg; and the three Parties, with all the
        Accoutrements of them, might well have been inclosed in a Hazel
        Nut: Yet was their Delineaments so lively, that I might easily
        discern her intire shape, whom I could not but with distracted
        thoughtfulness and a sad countenance behold; which the
        perceiving, said unto me, <i>Friend, Why art thou sad? I am not
          sad,</i> quoth I,<i> most Noble Lady, but am pensively
          meditating on what I behold, which doth not a little amaze me,
          the sight not being to be parallell’d in John Tradescants
          Chamber of Rarities, which is the System of the Novel Rarities
          of the known World: For whom I lately beheld glorious upon a
          Throne in the Majesty of a Queen, I now see cloistered up in a
          small Diaphanous Pix, in stature so small as is scarce
          credible: Moreover, whom I deemed so piously virtuous a Lady,
          to be so retiredly naked with a man, only attended with a
          Water-bearer, makes me very thoughtful what this thing should
          be. Moreover, it was my hopes so to have ingratiated my self
          into your favour, as to have been a Servant unto you, who I
          see are otherwise provided of a Lover.</i> Then said she, <i>My


          Friend, what you admire in this strange Metamorphosis of me,
          know that it is by a Magical Vertue, which is alone given to
          me from GOD, my immediate Lord and Ruler; and for any
          Diabolical Art, which your Scruple seems to manifest your
          suspition of, it is because of your inexperience in these
          things; and this your Ignorance is no way provoking unto me,
          for in these Affairs (though a man) yet you are but a Child;
          and this liberty I allow all my Sons while they are Children,
          so to speak, so to think, and so to act; and I love to hear
          and answer their childish prattle. Know then that the Devil is
          but one of my Servants, and in my Kingdom he doth serve GOD,
          is and my Lord: And though of all my Servants he is the worst,
          yet he can do nothing of himself, either without me, or
          against me, or above me: He for the most part is a deceitful
          Jugler, and doth make things appear, that are not; but
          whatever is actually effected by him, is nothing but what is
          in my Power: He only applies Agents to Patients, and adds a
          little of his own villainous qualities, as a circumstantial
          aggravation of the horror of what he thus (by my virtue)
          brings to pass, and then his villainous mind attributes that
          to himself, which is my Act, that so he might arrogate the
          honour die to my Lord and his Master. Now I will tell you a
          strange thing, which yet is very true: I am obedient to all my
          Subjects, which are many, and they obey me; I rule them, and
          they do as it were inforce me, for so my Lord hath pleased to
          ordain it: If they call me, I am straight at hand; yea, in my
          Body which thou seest (which is no Body but only
          representative for I am all Spirit) I feel the Sympathies and
          Antipathies, the Actions and Passions of every thing in the
          World; and I must be always present, for nothing is or can be
          well done without I be present: I always work according to the
          subject and its disposition, which doth alter the effect
          wonderfully. In a word, whatever thou seest that I am, and
          more then thou canst see by far, though thou hadst the Eyes of
          Argus. My Rule is not as is the Rule of Princes among Men, but
          I am serviceable to all, yea to the least Worm in the World;
          and because I am so serviceable, therefore my Master hath
          appointed that nothing can or may disobey me, or offer
          violence to me; the Devil here hath no power, though malice
          enough: Therefore my Lord hath given me his own Diploma to
          make me the more Honourable; first, An Omnisciency of all
          things which are done in the World, as touching the Being,
          Conservation, or Mutation of them; and next, an Omnipresency,
          by which I am every where present at once, and I am seated in
          the Will of God, which is my Centre. All my Subjects are put
          under Man, therefore he hath a free power to act any thing
          within his reach in the World; and the Soul of Man is as it
          were a Magnet unto me, and all my Subjects, in its Exaltation
          and Union, by Faith to my Lord and Master; though since Man
          lost his Dignity, he lost also his Knowledge, and his Will is
          liable to the Temptations of the Devil; and so as many as by
          renouncing their Creator do devote themselves to Stan, he hath
          by his confederacy power to exalt their Will, and to apply
          their Power to the effecting of things possible in Nature, and
          impossible for the Devil to do alone, (whose pride would scorn
          to crave help, if he could) and beyond the knowledge of the
          inthralled Caytiff, who mistaking the effect, and not seeing
          how it was done by himself and no Satan (though his power for
          want of knowledge to employ it, without this help were made
          use of by him, and applied according to his own Devilish
          Design) the Wretch is insnared to bind over both his Soul and
          Body to the Devil, as a requital of this Service, so crafty a
          Deceiver is he. But this being from my present scope, I shall
          forbear to speak further of it at present, lest I should
          distract, not edifie you. Now as concerning your jealousie for
          that you see me naked with this King, know that this place and
          my Kingdom are in the State of Innocency, though we are by the
          Fall of Adam laid subject to Vanity; and till the final
          Restitution of that Fall, I am forbidden to work anything of
          my own accord beyond the state of fading incorruptibility,
          though all things have an incorruptible Spirit, which when
          Heaven and Earth shall be renewed, shall cause an Immutable
          Glory in all these things. Know then that this King is my
          Servant, and he hath many Brethren who in their passage to him
          are taken Prisoners, and kept in bondage, and there is no way
          to Redeem them, unless he give his Flesh and Blood for their
          Ransom, which cannot be effectual, unless he die and arise
          from the Dead: This I cannot perform alone my self, nor can
          any help me herein but Man alone; for God hath here limited my
          power, I cannot bring Agents and Patients together, though he
          hath given me power to work on them being composed, and to
          effect what may serve for the Ransom of those poor Captives,
          and he hath given man a free power to act in subordination to
          him in the World, though through the Fall the Wings of this
          power are not clips at all, but clogged with Ignorance, that
          it is very uneffectual in comparison of its virtue, If thou
          couldest but understand and believe, thy very Soul would
          command all Nature in the whole Fabrick of it: for if thou
          didst but know things as they are, thou wouldest withal
          clearly see the Dignity of thy Soul, being the Image of God;
          and this would command Faith, and kindle Desire: Now Faith and
          a kindled Desire in the Soul is that extatical Passion which
          attracts the whole Phaenomena of Nature. This is the Dignity
          of a Mental man. Now then, my Friend, harken to me, and what I
          advise, that do; help me in what I cannot, and I will help
          thee in what thou canst not; so shalt thou be (to GOD
          subordinate) Lord both of me and mine; and the Blood of this
          King, which redeems his Brethren, will give thee a Medicine to
          command all the Imperfections of thy Mortal Body; and though
          it be no Antidote against Death, the irrevocable Decree being
          past, yet it triumphs over all the Miseries of Life, both of
          Poverty and Sickness, and it possesseth a Man of the most
          incomparable Treasures of this World.</i> Then full of
        Admiration, with Tears for very Joy trickling down abundantly, I
        bespake her, and said, <i>Lady, I thank you for your so great
          favour to me, as so familiarly to discourse with me; Now then,
          without any Complement, I am yours (ad usque aras) and
          whatever you please, that I will do.</i> Then said she, <i>Under


          this Chamber and Closet there is a Stove, put a Fire into it,
          for this King must sweat to death. Ah sweet Lady</i>, said I,
        <i>and what will become of you? Care you not for that,</i> said
        she, <i>do you as I bid you: But yet farther to satisfie your
          curious mind, let me tell you, That I indure without hurt the
          most violent Fires which are or can be made, for I am in them
          all, and no less in the most frozen places.</i> Then I
        considered, and methought my Understanding it was enlarged, and
        I perceived the extent of Nature, and of a sudden she appeared
        not to my sight; but where she was I saw a most exquisite Light,
        which took up an incredible small room, and methought my Head
        seemed as it were diaphanous: And while I considered these
        things, it came into my mind to wonder what was become of my
        Guide, for I miss’d him. While these thoughts perplexed me, an
        Answer was given, as if from an intelligent Spirit within the
        Glass, saying, <i>Let not thoughts fill your mind, he whom you
          seek is with us, for so it must be, this King is his Lord.</i>
        This straight made me view the complexion of the Water-bearer,
        and his countenance told me that he was my very Guide: Then I
        viewed his Pitcher well, and I found his Pitcher was clear as
        pure Silver; and what was strange, the Bearer, and the Pitcher,
        and the Water in it were one; and in the midst of the Water, as
        it were in the very center, there was a most radiant twinkling
        Spark, which sent forth its beams even to the very surface of
        the Water, and appeared as it were a Lamp burning, and yet no
        way distinguishable from the Water. The Voice then spake to me a
        second time, <i>Delay not to put Fire under us, and govern it
          as you shall hear the Voice direct you</i>. Then I put Fire in
        at the open door at the top of the high Turret, and Coals upon
        it, and caused my doors to be stopt both above and below, and on
        every side; only by a secret passage I conveyed my Immortal Fire
        under the Chamber in which was the Closet, and forthwith when
        all things were heated, the Water-bearer took his Pitcher, and
        through a small Pope he poured out his Water, without any
        particular shape, only it added a luster thereto; and no sooner
        was the Water poured forth, but the Water-bearer with his
        Pitcher popt as it were under the streams, and I saw them no
        more: And though the clearness of the Water did make it to
        appear as it were Diaphanous, yet I found by a diligent view
        that it was not so really, but only as to apparency, and that it
        was indeed very compact: And as I wistfully beheld it, I saw as
        it were a goodly Lady in the midst of it, which was no way
        resembling the former Beauty which I had discoursed withal,
        whose Name was <i>Nature</i>; yet indeed very beautiful, even
        to the parallel of <i>Helena</i>. This Lady was naked, and of
        an admirable fair complexioned Skin, as bright as the finest
        Silver; at first she appeared very small, and waxed bigger and
        bigger, until the Water appeared no more, but she her self had
        transmuted its whole substance into her shape. This sight I
        beheld with pity, for she (far unlike unto the first Lady) was
        wholly impatient of the heat which I had made, and yet was so
        inclosed in the Closet that she could not get out; she sweat
        therefore even as though she would melt, and seemed as though
        continually fainting: Then the King (who seemed as it were glad
        of the heat) seeing her knew her to be his Sister, his Mother,
        and his Wife, and compassionating her estate, ran into her and
        took her in his Arms, and she feeling him, did so strongly
        embrace him, that he could not shake her off, and with her sweat
        partly, and partly with her tears, she so bestream his Kingly
        Robes, which shone like unto <i>Tagus</i> or <i>Pactolus</i>,
        that they were all suddenly changed into a colour Argent: the
        King loving her exceedingly, asked her what she desired? She
        answered <i>That her desire was to have of him Conjugal Fealty;
          for,</i> said she, <i>I cannot endure this heat, but I must
          die in it, and without me your Highness can have no Off-spring</i>:
        The King condescended, and granted her Request, and so soon as
        she conceived the Kings Seed, she said that she was better able
        to endure the Fire which did prevail upon her. </p>
      <p>Therefore not contented, she had a second, a third, and fourth
        Benevolence, even to the eleventh time: Then said the King, <i>I
          am very faint and weak:</i> and trying to go, as formerly, his
        Legs and Feet failed him, his Flesh and Body wasted as it were
        to nothing, and so continued worse and worse, until at length
        his Body being thus wasted by Venery, began to sweat
        exceedingly, so long he sweated, till he was as it were wholly
        consumed; and his Wife seeing what fell out, wept bitterly, and
        her tears mingling with her Husbands sweat, grew into a large
        stream, in which both she and the King were drowned so far I
        beheld: And then when they were both wholly out of sight, I
        mused at the strangeness of the object, and while I wondered,
        methought I saw them ascend again; but considering it well, I
        found that there swam upon the Water a Carcass, which being
        wholly void of Life, did with the heat of the place draw to
        putrefaction more and more, so that it grew livid, black,
        blewish, and yellowish, and sent up most venomous Exhalations,
        and with its odour did so infect the Waters, which were before
        of an Argent Clearness, that they did grow very thick and dark,
        and at last black, resembling the form of muddy slime which is
        found in Boggs; and at length with the heat of the Sun the
        moisture was wholly dried up (as Moorish low Grounds in the
        summer time use to be) and I sought what was become of my
        Bodies, and I found a horrible venomous rumefied Toad, which
        seemed as it were dying; and a Raven almost famished walking
        there to look for meat, lighted upon the Toad, and preyed upon
        him, and with its poison died, and made a most filthy squallid
        Liquor blacker than Ink, and tick like to Pitch melted, which
        made me wonder at the sight: And going to depart, I heard a
        Voice which said to me, <i>You must not leave us; if you do,
          our Persons and Kingdom is lost without recovery. </i>Then my
        Eyes were opened, and I saw <i>Nature</i> walking up and down
        among the Carcases, and in her hand her unparallell’d Lamp; and
        taking a more serious view, I saw in those rotten Atoms the
        Idea’s of all things natural and supernatural; and I found the
        dead King with his Wife were intombed in a Field Sable, and the
        Tomb as it were of polished Jet or Ebony; and as in that place
        all things were strange, so most strange was it that the Tomb
        and the intombed Carcass were one, and that inseparably. Also
        upon the Tomb I found written a Prophecy, <i>viz</i>. That they
        (if the Fire were kept equal and continual) should rise again,
        and be more glorious and powerful than ever they were before.
        Then said I to the Voice which is in the Glass, I must be
        directed both what, and how, and when to do. The voice answered
        me, Take no care, only do as I shall direct you, and all shall
        be well; in the mean time you may view the paces that are about,
        only be sure that you neglect not your time of attending here:
        And for to take away the tediousness which the length of time
        would otherwise work, ask of me, and I shall inform you in
        whatever you desire, not shall I thing my discourse to me a
        burden, so you will not think your labour a trouble. Then said
        I, Not so; though I should be bound to serve you during my whole
        Life, yet should I count it a priviledge, not a burden. Then she
        gave unto me as it were a Ball of fine Silk, wound up as on a
        bottom, and said, Make this fast to a Pin of this Tower, and
        then go round and behold the place, it may shorten the time to
        you, and unwind it as you go, and by it you may return till you
        know the place. </p>
      <p><i>But do not after the common guise.</i> </p>
      <p>Then I passed along, and was no sooner out of that place, but a
        very thick misty darkness apprehended me, so thick that I might
        feel it; and though my head were as it were transparent and very
        light, and I took also a Candle with me, which was burning there
        continually at the entrance of the Tower, yet the darkness was
        such, that it would not receive the light, for they were not
        homogenial, but were a little dis-joyned by the Rays fo the
        Light, and as it were here and there condensed into strange
        figures, as of Birds, Beasts, and creeping things of monstrous
        shapes: and by reason of this opposition the Rays of the Light
        extended but a little way, and the Light most clear did shoot as
        it were in Beams, and the darkness stood as I were in clusters
        by it self. </p>
      <p>There were as it were a multitude of men, who seeing my Light
        in hand, which they could not discern well, they being I that
        dark which would not be inlightned, but as through a thick cloud
        they beheld my Candle, and judged I ominous, and left their
        stations: for their eyes with dark and smoak were so tender,
        that my Candle over-poured them, and they could not bear its
        luster; therefore they crying out, ran away. I mused much at
        this, how they could be in such Cimmerian Darkness; and as I
        wondered, I espied that the had with them Light as it were of
        Fox-fire, or rotten wood, and Glow-worms Tails, and with this
        they sat in consultation, reading <i>Geber, Rhasis</i>, and
        such whom I heard them name, and commenting on them, not without
        much pleasantness: Then I considered that the Light which I had
        brought with me, did not enlighten the place, but stood
        separated as it were from the darkness; and withal I remembred
        that once there was Light in the World, and the darkness
        comprehended it not, and that darkness had a false ire Light of
        its own, with which it seemed to its inhabitants wonderous well
        inlightned: I set down my Candle, and went with my Thread in
        hand, by which I intended to return. When I was gone out of sigh
        of my Candle, my head began to seem as it were opacous, and a
        wind had almost blown me down: Then I took my bottom of Thread,
        and made it fast to my Girdle, lest it might drop out of my
        hand; and well it was that I did so, for soon a Vertigo came
        upon me, and I fell and slumbered; and when I awaked, methought
        it was no more darkness, but day-light about me: I wondered at
        the very strange change, and still felt for my Tread, which by
        that Light I could not see, but only feel it. I began to look
        about me, to see where I was, and behold I was in a ruinous
        place of many millions of turnings, each leading several ways;
        and every room was so inlightned with Fox-fire and
        Glow-worm-Tail, that for want of a better Light is seemed as if
        it were day: I took out of my Pocket a small Book to see if I
        could read in it, it was called <i>Enchiridion Physicae
          Restitutae</i>, with an <i>Arcanum</i> at the end of it, and
        I could not read one word in it. There me met a man aged and
        decrepit, his Face rugged, his Eyes bleared, his hands and
        Fingers corroded, and saluted me, and said merrily,<i> What Book
          have you there? It is, </i>said I, <i>Arcanum Hermeticum</i>.
        It is a good book, saith he. He and <i>Sendivow</i> are the two
        best that ever wrote. But, said I, I went to peruse my Book, and
        I can read not one word in it. That’s strange, quoth he; let me
        see it: Then I shewed it him, and he read out of it such strange
        things that I never had heard of before; and <i>Sandivogius</i>,
        saith he, is of the same mind. Then he began to read in him, and
        reach such Processes that I had never heard of. I do remember
        well the Authors, and what they wrote, but never to my
        remembrance did I find what you read in them, said I. Look on
        them your self, said he, and you shall find it plain: I went to
        look on the Book, but could not distinguish any word in it;
        which made me wonder. Then I thought with my self, that as that
        Light had a peculiar difference from that Light which I saw
        about the Tower where I was before, so it might have its
        peculiar Objects: This Opinion I had confirmed by this, for that
        having <i>Geber</i> and <i>Rhasis</i> with me, I tried how I
        could read there, and all the Processes I could read very well,
        only some places seemed as it were left out, and a distance of
        white left: I knew that my Books were perfect, and some of the
        paces (which were, as they seemed to me, left out) I remembred
        very well to be those places in which the Truth was couched in
        few words: Then I returned by my Thread to my Candle, and
        straight m head returned to its former diaphanity: I took my
        Candle in my way, and of a sudden all my places that seemed
        light before, returned to be Cimmerian darkness; only with the
        time that I had been there, I found my Eyes were beginning to
        grow tender, and smarted and itched at the first glimpse of this
        true Light, which then in comparison of the Light I had before
        seen, did not seem barely Light, but the Super-Coelestial Light
        of Paradise. Then I demanded of her with whom in the Glass I had
        former converse, concerning what I had seen. She told me, That
        they were such who wrot in <i>Alchymy</i> according to the
        Light of Fancy, and not of Nature; though to them their Light
        seem clear enough, yet can they see nothing by it but what is
        phantastical, and mystically or sophistically written by the
        Envious, for the seducing of such fanciful Doters: therefore
        when once the Light of Nature is brought to their station, it
        discovers Cimmerian darkness there, where their imaginary Light
        only shines, such as is Fox-fire and Glow-worms Tails, that
        shine only in the dark; This Light makes their Eyes so tender,
        that the Lamp of Nature makes them fly. Moreover, whatever is
        written according to this Light, they cannot see, nay they
        cannot endure the Light of the true <i>Luna</i> of the wise
        men: for any true Light discovers their Darkness, and yet their
        Darkness is uncapable of apprehending the Light. Now in that you
        went in among them without your Candle, it was a bold adventure,
        for you had you lost your Thread, you could never have returned.
        Then I looked into my Tower, and did as I was directed; and
        again I went to view those parts of Cimmerian Darkness once
        more, yet with my Candle in hand, and my Thread at my Girdle;
        when I came the second time, at the sight of this Light all
        fled, so that I could not meet with any, but I entered into
        several turning which I saw, and found in them several works
        curiously erected, in which I might guess they aimed at nothing
        less than the Philosophers Stone. </p>
      <p><i>With Sulphurs.</i> </p>
      <p>I found one Furnace most curiously built, in which all degrees
        of heat imaginable, by the Art of man, might be kept with one
        fire; in which was set a multitude of curious Glasses, in which
        were several Matters, some digesting, others subliming, others
        distilling, others calcining, and about the Glasses and the
        Furnace was written this of <i>Geber, Per Deum Sulphur est omne
          illud illuminans quod est supra terram</i>. By this I knew,
        that Sulphur was the Subject on which was wrought; and indeed
        with so great cunning, that I could not but admire the ingenuity
        of the men: and knowing that what a man prizeth (though it be a
        trifle) yet to spoil or destroy that would be an injury, I
        meddled not with any Glass, (for indeed there were Labourers
        that fled not, because they knew nothing, but only wrought as
        they were directed :) and when I came, they could not perceive
        that I had any Candle in my hand, and wondred their Masters
        should so fly from a phansie. Moreover I found that they could
        not see any light from the Fox-fire and Glow-worms tails, which
        were there; but the place being dark, as being under ground,
        they wrought by Candles and Lamps, which yet could give their
        Masters no light, but they sought all the world over for those
        shining subjects: Yet I could notwithstanding both discern utter
        darkness, which the Rays of my Candle would not enlighten. Then
        said I to the Workmen, What is this that is brought in here? Oh,
        said they, they are Sol and Luna terrestrial, whereby our
        Masters can see clearly the Natures of all things in the world,
        and to make by their light the great Elixir; and though we can
        see no light in them, or very little, it is because of our
        Ignorance in these things, therefore we use our Lamps to work
        by. Where are your Masters? said I. They ran away, said they,
        because when you came they said you were a Devil, and brought an
        ominous light with you, and if they did but once see that with a
        full view, their Works would all vanish; they did therefore lay
        a few Charms, and ran away. Then I looked, and the ground under
        me was full of Crosses and Circles, at which I laughed, and
        departed into another Room. </p>
      <p><i>Or Salts preparate in divers wise,</i> <br>
        <i>Neither with Corrosives, nor with Fire alone,</i> <br>
        <i>Neither with Vinegar, nor with Waters ardent,</i> <br>
        <i>Nor with the vapour of Lead, our Stone</i> <br>
        <i>Calcined is according to our intent.</i> <br>
        <i>All those, to Calcining which are so bent,</i> <br>
        <i>From this hard Science withdraw their hand,</i> <br>
        <i>Till they our Calcining understand.</i> </p>
      <p>And there I found in like fort rare Furnaces, with this
        Inscription, <i>Sal Metallorum est Lapis Philosophorum</i>:
        many processes I beheld, which would be tedious to relate. On I
        passed from thence, and in another Room I found large Furnaces,
        in which they were labouring about Waters fort; others were with
        strong reverberations calcining Lead, Tin, Copper, Iron, and all
        metals and Minerals; others were drawing Spirit of Vinegar with
        a great care, till it became exquisitely sharp, and in this they
        laboured to calcine several Metalline bodies; others were
        rectifying Spirit of Wine, so long toll no Body almost or
        Receiver could hold it, it was so subtile, and this they said
        was the true Water of Life that must do the work; others were
        subliming of Lead, hoping after it was exquisitely sublimed, to
        have out of it that <i>Menstruum</i> which should effect the
        Stone, without any further laying on of hands. This when I had
        seen, I returned to my Furnace, and recruited my Fire as I was
        directed, and made a particular relation of what I had seen, and
        desired the verdict of Nature upon them all. She told me, that
        they could never by this way expect any thing but loss. I asked
        here if they might not with trying many things, a length hit the
        right. She told me, No, they had not any ground of truth, nor
        could they expect either the great secret, or any other
        particular profitable truth, in that way. Then said I, Noble
        Lady, pray let me know the reason of their error, that I may
        know how to avoid the like. </p>
      <p><i>For by such Calcination their bodies be spent,</i> <br>
        <i>Which minisheth the moisture of our Stone;</i> <br>
        <i>Therefore when bodies to powder are brent,</i> <br>
        <i>Dry as ashes of Tree or Bone,</i> <br>
        <i>Of such Calxes then will we none:</i> <br>
        <i>For moisture we multiply radical,</i> <br>
        <i>In Calcining minishing none at all.</i> </p>
      <p>Then said she, besides that they work not on the true Matter,
        they work not in the right way, which are two most desparate
        errors; for our work is to make a substance fluid, penetrating
        and entering, that may have ingress into imperfect Metals: for
        which cause we do preserve humidity, without which our Stone
        cannot be penetrative. So then instead of purifying the crude,
        and ripening what is raw by these Calcinations, the tender Soul
        is put to flight, and the crudities are more strongly vitrified,
        so that all hope of fruit is wholly by this means taken away:
        for take this for a rule, whatever either by violence of Fire,
        or Corrosives, is turned into a dry Powder or Calx, it is wholly
        reprobate in our work: for though we Calcine, yet it is in such
        a Fire in which our moisture is not burnt, and in such a Vessel
        so closed that the Spirits are retained, and in a word so sweet
        is our Regimen in reference to our Matter, that moisture is
        advanced, and is made more unctuous, and by consequent more
        ingressive. </p>
      <p><i>And for a sure ground of our true Calcination,</i> <br>
        <i>Work wittily only kind with kind,</i> <br>
        <i>For kind unto kind hath appetitive inclination.</i> </p>
      <p>But all this is not enough to declare our Calcination, for
        Operation follows Preparation, and he that doth not before he
        begin to work, prepare his Matters, and set true Agent and
        patient together, it is not his Regimen that can or will produce
        anything. Therefore first you must know, that we joyn kind with
        kind in our work, for Nature is mended and retained with its own
        Nature: for this cause is our King wedded to the Water-bearers
        Daughter, of which Water-bearer I told you that his body, his
        Pitcher, and the Water in it, are all one; and his Daughter was
        the Queen which arose out of the water, in which was seen a Lamp
        burning: Wonder not at it, that a Queen should spring out of a
        Water-bearers loins, for the King is also his Son, and he is
        greater than both. For know, that in this place there is nothing
        so hard to get as Water, which cannot be brought but by him that
        hath the Keys of the whole Kingdom. Take this then for a great
        secret, our Water-bearer is Father to the King and Queen: the
        King being at perfect years, is at his own dispose, and enjoys
        more Riches then his Father; but his Father hath the Key of a
        Closet, in which is Riches enough for all in the Kingdom, to
        make every Subject as rich as the King; but the dispose of the
        wealth the King only is to have, yet can he not have it in his
        possession till he marry his Sister, which is in the water of
        the pitcher invisible. This his Sister, is also his Mother and
        his Father, for it is one with the Water-bearer, the Water and
        the Pitcher, as is said. By reason of his Consanquinity the King
        embraceth his Sister very desirously, and she by his embraces
        appears as a Queen, and then the Water-bearer, and his Water and
        Pitcher vanish, and the King and Queen remain alone: at length
        both King and Queen are drowned, after the immoderate use of
        Venery, and violent sweating and pissing, which sweat, tears and
        urine, do make one Sea, in which swim two Fishes without flesh
        and bones, which after resolve and make one Broth, which is
        called Water permanent. </p>
      <p><i>Who knoweth not this in knowledge is blind,</i> <br>
        <i>He may forth wander as mist in the wind,</i> <br>
        <i>Wotting never with profit where to light,</i> <br>
        <i>Because he understands not our words aright.</i> </p>
      <p>Thus though I have somewhat Metaphorically deciphered our true
        principles, yet so plainly as that you may with diligence
        understand the meaning, and unless you know this, you will
        proceed blind-fold in your work, not knowing the causes of
        things, so that every puff of Sophisters will toss you, like as
        a Feather is tossed in the Air with a blast of wind: four our
        Books are full of obscurity, and Philosophers write horrid
        Metaphors and Riddles to them who are not upon a sure bottom,
        which like to a running Stream will carry them down head-long
        into despair and errors, which they can never escape till they
        so far understand our writings, as to discern the subject Matter
        of our secrets, which being known the rest is not so hard. </p>
      <p><i>Joyn kind therefore with kind, as good reason is,</i> <br>
        <i>For every Burgeon answers his own seed,</i> <br>
        <i>Man getteth Man, a Beast a Beast I wis,</i> <br>
        <i>Further to treat of this it is no need.</i> <br>
        <i>But understand this point if you will speed,</i> <br>
        <i>Each thing is first Calcin’d in his own kind,</i> <br>
        <i>This well conceiv’d, fruit therein shalt thou find.</i> </p>
      <p>Step therefore not one step further till you have learned this
        Lesson, namely, to wed Consanquinity with Consanquinity, and
        consider well what it is you desire to produce, and according to
        that let be your intention. Take the last thing in your
        Intention, for the first thing in your Principles: this is
        according to Nature, and it is the true ground of all
        Generation, for out of kind nothing doth engender; a Man
        begetteth a Man, and not a Lion, nor doth a Lion beget a Sheep,
        a Rose doth not produce a Thorn, nor a Nettle a Gilliflower; and
        so, if need were, I could particularly demonstrate it throughout
        all Vegetable, Animal, and Mineral Bodies, but it is so plain a
        thing that I need say no more, but leave it with you as the
        Foundation-stone on which you shall build whatever you intend.
        Attempt nothing out of its own nature and kind, lest you reap a
        fancy instead of truth. Whatever you intend to increase by way
        of Multiplication, attempt it only in its own kind; and so in
        this work especially, in which Calcination is the mingling of
        Seminal influence, which must be done in the same way of
        homogeneity. If you apprehend this in its cause aright, and know
        how to apply this doctrine in your operation as you ought, in
        this you will find great benefit, and a door hereby opened to
        the discovery of greater Mysteries. </p>
      <p><i>And we make Calx unctuous, black, white, and red.</i> </p>
      <p>And now the opportunity of this discourse, leads me to handle
        our magical Calxes, know that we do Calcine three times in our
        work, of which the general principle is, that our Calxes are not
        combust powders, but unctuous, for in them we innoble the
        Sulphurs, which are the Basis of Radical Humidity, which <i>Raymund</i>
        calls Oyls and unguents: So then our Calxes are one in kind, and
        do only differ in colour and maturity. Our first is black of the
        blackest, and is called <i>Saturn</i>; our second white of the
        whitest, and is called <i>Luna</i>; our third is red of the
        reddest, and is called <i>Sol</i>. </p>
      <p><i>Of three degrees or our Base be perfite.</i> </p>
      <p>These Calxes are the periods of so many Circulations, and have
        so many degrees allowed to each of them; our first Circulation
        confounds the elements, our second renews the Air, and the third
        exalts the Fire, and then is our Stone perfect. </p>
      <p><i>Flexible as Wax, else stand they in no stead.</i> </p>
      <p>These Calxes are the periods of so many Circulations, and have
        so many degrees allowed to each of them; our first Circulation
        confounds the Elements, our second renews the Air, and the third
        exalts the Fire, and then is our Stone perfect. </p>
      <p><i>Flexible as Wax, else stand they in no stead.</i> </p>
      <p>Our Calxes thus graduated, are distinguishable from all the
        Calxes in the world; first, is that they are done without any
        laying on of hands: secondly, from their exquisite subtility of
        parts (for they are finer then Atoms of the Sun) joined with an
        eminent Humidity, by Reason of which, to the astonishment of the
        beholders, they flow like unto melted Wax; the first in the
        Glass by continuance of heat, and so the second as not being
        come to their period of perfection, and the second and third
        upon a plate of hot Metal, or on a melted Metal, or on <i>Mercury</i>
        heated so long till it is ready to fly. </p>
      <p><i>By right long process, as Philosophers do write,</i> <br>
        <i>A year we take or more for our respite:</i> <br>
        <i>For in less space our Calxes will not be made,</i> <br>
        <i>Able to tyne with Tincture that will not fade.</i> </p>
      <p>Which last Calxes, as they are the period of Arts skill, and
        Natures power in this thing, so they are a considerable time in
        perfecting; the former in five months, <i>viz</i>. the white,
        and the red in nine months and a half, which is the true time,
        and a month we allow for the preparing of our materials, and
        three months for Fermentations and Imbibitions, so that our
        whole Operation is above a year. For indeed it is not an
        ordinary thing that we expect, but a Fire-abiding Tincture,
        which is unfading and incorruptible, which cannot be expected in
        a short time; yet verily the Industry of the Work-man may
        forward, or set back his Work, a month, two, or three, according
        to his more exquisitely preparing of his matters, and governing
        of his Fire, whose exact Regimen is for speed, or retarding of
        the Work, almost all in all. </p>
      <p><i>And for thy proportion thou must beware,</i> <br>
        <i>For therein mayst thou be beguil’d,</i> <br>
        <i>Therefore thy Work that thou no mar.</i> </p>
      <p>After the knowledge of the true material Subject, and its
        Preparation, the next main thing to be understood is the mystery
        of Proportion, which is a Secret of no light concernment, for
        many erre therein. Thou shalt therefore understand, that our
        Proportion is two-fold, Internal and External; the Internal <i>pondus</i>
        is a Labyrinth in which all erre who know our Subject as many
        do, but not its Proportion. He who would effect any thing, must
        principally learn this which is set down in Golden words, in <i>Bernard



          Trevisan</i> his treatise of the Chymical Miracle: <i>The
          Sulphur,</i> saith he, <i>which is in the Mercury, and
          predominates not, is the Fire alone which governs the whole
          Work; and he therefore that in these things would be a
          skillful Artist, let him know how much Fire is beyond other
          Elements in subtility, and what a proportion of it will
          overcome all the rest.</i> These Golden words, worthy to be
        ingraven in Marble, are the true foundation of our <i>pondus</i>.
      </p>
      <p><i>With Mercury as much then so subtil’d,</i> <br>
        <i>One of the Sun, two of the moon,</i> <br>
        <i>Till all together like pap be done.</i> </p>
      <p>But there is an External proportion, which is as necessary as
        the other, or else the Work will either for lack, or excess of
        moisture, be destroyed; and that is thus: Take thy Body which
        without any equivocation is most pure Gold, let it be
        exquisitely purged, then files or laminated, or calcined with
        Mercury, as is vulgarly known; of this take one part, and of our
        Water (which is without equivocation Argent-vive animated, which
        we then call our <i>Luna</i>) two parts, mix them together in
        an <i>Amalgama</i>, and grind them in a Mortar of Glass, or on
        a Marble, till they become very soft, and all the grettiness of
        the Body be subtilized with the <i>Mercury</i>, that they may
        seem to be one pap or paste, which we call Inceration. </p>
      <p><i>Then make the Mercury four to the Sun,</i> <br>
        <i>Two to the Moon as it should be.</i> </p>
      <p>Now pluck up your attention, for my speech will be difficult.
        When your Body to your Mercury in outward proportion is one to
        two, then must your <i>Mercury</i> in its inward proportion be
        just opposite, that s, four to one, else you shall never make
        the Harmony that is good Musick; for do not think it is all one,
        with one and the same proportioned <i>Mercury</i>, to put
        either one of the Body or two of the Water, or one to three, or
        two to three, or three to four; no verily, till you come to
        this, to measure your Lamp clibanically to your Furnace, you are
        yet in the dark for Practice, though you may be true in Theory.
        I almost tremble to speak of this point, for it is the very
        wilde of those who study this Art, and cannot come to the end of
        their desires for want of true information in this particular.
        Know then, that when thy <i>Mercury</i> is to <i>Sol</i> in
        external pondus two to one, it must be as I said in respect to
        its own internal qualities, four to the <i>Sun</i> to two of
        the <i>Moon</i>; therefore, saith <i>Artephius</i>, that our
        Water is of kin to the <i>Sun</i> and to the <i>Moon</i>, but
        more to the <i>Sun</i> then to the <i>Moon</i>: Note this
        well, that is four to one, as <i>Ripley</i> hath it. This is
        indeed a great secret, which hath befooled many. </p>
      <p>Know that our Eagles duly prepared are accommodated to the <i>Sun</i>
        from three to ten, so that four to the <i>Sun</i> will be just
        seven, and thy <i>Mercury</i> thus proportioned, let it be two
        of the <i>Moon</i> to one of its Body. Know also, that our
        Water is not called the <i>Moon</i>, but in, or in reference to
        conjunction, and so let the <i>Moon</i> be two. In reference to
        its one Constitution, it is called <i>Mercury</i>, (for so it
        ought to be in that form and flux) and so it ought to be four to
        the <i>Sun</i>, that is seven Eagles, which are to the <i>Sun</i>
        not before three, to which adding four, you make seven. </p>
      <p><i>And thus thy Work must be begun,</i> <br>
        <i>In figure of the Trinity,</i> <br>
        <i>Three of the Body, and of the Spirit three;</i> <br>
        <i>And for the unity of the substance spiritual,</i> <br>
        <i>One more then of the substance corporal.</i> </p>
      <p>And thus thy Work is brought to the true Touch-stone, and that
        is Trinity in Unity, for in this <i>pondus</i> of your <i>Mercury</i>
        you have a potential Body, which is one part of three of the <i>Mercury</i>,
        which may by Art be made appear. This potential Body is to be
        reckoned to your actual Body, and that makes with it two, and so
        <i>in potentia</i> you have two of the Body to one of the
        Spirit, which is three to three, and one to one. And this
        potential Body is at first spiritual and volatile, (<i>in
          manifesto</i>) for unity sake, without which could be no
        unity. Thus then a potential Body, but an actual Spirit, is
        joined with an actual Body, by which means the actual Body, when
        it is actually dissolved and made no Body, but a Spirit or
        Spiritual Body, then this potential Spiritual Body (which was in
        the Water before) receives this potentialized Body, and both
        unite and congeal together, and is endowed with a double nature
        and virtue, that is, Spiritual and Corporal, heavenly and
        Earthly. And thus is made an union, of which the proportion of
        the Water in its first preparation, and its due mixing with its
        Body, was the moving cause, really though hiddenly enforcing the
        Compound by the necessity of its end, which it could not have
        done had it not been so proportioned. </p>
      <p><i>By Raymunds Repertory this is true</i> <br>
        <i>Proportion, there who list to look;</i> <br>
        <i>The same my Doctor to me did shew.</i> </p>
      <p>This is the true meaning of our proportions, both according to
        the mystery of Internal and External <i>pondus</i>; this is
        that which Authors have so much concealed, both <i>Raymund,
          Arnold, Albert</i>, and all who ever have wrote of it: I have
        broke the Ice first in plain discovering the mystery. </p>
      <p>Yet for all this, you stand in need either of a Master, or of
        more than ordinary pains, accompanied with the blessing of God,
        else never look to find out this mystery, which though by me
        revealed more plainly then any, yet it will and must remain
        secret even till the fullness of time. </p>
      <p><i>But three of the Spirit Bacon took</i> <br>
        <i>To one of the Body: For which I awoke</i> <br>
        <i>Many a night ere I it wist.</i> <br>
        <i>And both be true, take which you list.</i> </p>
      <p>There is another External proportion, which is three of the
        Spirit to one of the Body, according to the working of Noble <i>Bacon</i>,
        and many others; which though it seem little to differ from the
        former, yet there is a wide difference: I know them both, but
        shall not set down the grounds of the other; if you understand
        the former, the rule of it may guide you in the latter; for
        there is an infallible rule of proportion, how the external and
        Internal ought to concur, to make a sweet Harmony: only let me
        this assure you out of <i>Norton, That if thy Body have plenty
          of drink, Then must thou wake when thou desir’st to wink;</i>
        it will cost thee more assiduity of boiling for to dry up three
        parts, then two parts of Water; and there must be necessarily a
        diversity of Internal <i>pondus</i>, for the Water being of one
        and the same Internal heat, and the external fire being the
        same, the difference of decoction between two parts and three
        will be half in half almost until blackness, though after
        blackness there is one and the same time to both. Yet either of
        these proportions are true, only you must be sure to qualifie
        your <i>Mercury</i> in heat, and your Regimen of your Furnace
        accordingly as you work with one or other of these proportions,
        or else your first token of the Crows head will come wonderful
        slowly. </p>
      <p><i>If the Water also be equal in proportion</i> <br>
        <i>To the Earth with heat in due measure,</i> <br>
        <i>Of them will spring a new Burgeon,</i> <br>
        <i>Both white and red in a tincture pure,</i> <br>
        <i>Which in the Fire shall never endure.</i> <br>
        <i>Kill thou the quick, the dead revive;</i> <br>
        <i>Make trinity Unity without any strive.</i> <br>
        <i>This is the surest and best proportion,</i> <br>
        <i>For there is least of the past Spiritual;</i> <br>
        <i>The better therefore shall be solution,</i> <br>
        <i>Then if thou didst it with Water small,</i> <br>
        <i>Thine Earth over-glutting which loseth all.</i> <br>
        <i>Take heed therefore to Potters Loam,</i> <br>
        <i>And make thou never too nesh thy Womb.</i> <br>
        <i>That Loam behold how it temper’d is,</i> <br>
        <i>The mean also by which it is Calcinate,</i> <br>
        <i>And ever in mind look thou bear this,</i> <br>
        <i>That never thine Earth with Water be suffocate.</i> </p>
      <p>Also if your Water have its proportion qualified accordingly,
        you may temper it with your earth almost in an equal quality,
        that is, two to three, or three to four; but be sure then of
        your due government of external Fire, and a just size of your
        Vessel, and so you may expect from this mixture Conception and
        Generation: for in this <i>pondus</i> you shall find the death
        of the Spirit, and the quickening of the Body, and the exalting
        of your Tincture first into white, and after that into red,
        which will have ingress into Bodies, and tyne them permanently
        and radically. Though the Tincture is largest where the water is
        most, but the work is speediest where the Water is least, the
        Fire is also less hazardable; but your true proportion of your <i>Mercury</i>
        for such a <i>pondus</i> is hard to be found, and thou wilt not
        easily find it unless thou be very skilful; the middle
        proportion is less difficult, that of three to one is worse, for
        a <i>Tyro</i>, because he may very easily have his time made
        tedious by it. The last would be better for such a one, if it
        were not so hard to apprehend, for the Body would soon be made
        no Body, and the Spirit mortified, and so Union would follow in
        a short time, in comparison to other proportions. So then if
        thou knowest how to serve thy <i>Mercury</i> aright for its
        Internal proportion, the lesser thou puttest of the Spirit, the
        better and quicker shall be thy Calcination and Dissolution; and
        the more thou givest of the Water, the longer thou shalt be in
        attaining the mastery: but if thou glut thy Earth with Water,
        thou will so suffocate the active virtue, that thy moisture will
        not be dried up; at least it would require so tedious a
        decoction, that thou wouldest never see the effect. But the
        mediocrity is for thee the best, at least at first; be not too
        covetous, nor to prodigal, for over-driness and over-moisture
        are both enemies to Generation, and make a barren Womb. If thou
        be’st witty to apprehend therefore, I shall shew you the certain
        way of External proportion; for know, that as the Water is
        qualified internally, so doth it act externally, and if thou
        canst apprehend the sympathy that is between the inward quality,
        and the outward effect, thou mayst easily discern by what it
        apparent to sight, that which is hiddenly contained. Then for
        your true information take this rule: Let your Body be very well
        subtilized, and very pure, (which is a great matter, at the
        least 24 Carrats) mix this at first with twice as much of its
        Water, and grind it either on a clean Glass, or Marble Mortar;
        grind it thorowly, as Painters use to grind their Colours, and
        make no a light matter of this, for lack of one half hour or
        hours pain in thy Amalgamation, thou mayst set thy work backward
        20 or 30 days; for the more subtlely the <i>Amalgama</i> is
        mixed, the more easily and speedily it resolves into Mercury,
        and is wrought upon, and the signs appear. When thou hast
        soundly and well ground it, and washed it very clean, and dried
        it very thoroughly, so that there be not the least moisture in
        it, observe the temper; if it be plyable like to Paste, yet so
        as when you incline it this way or that, you see no Water run to
        the inclining side, which you may easily discern, it is a good
        and sure temper; but if it be so hard and dry, that it will not
        spread easily, it lacks moisture; or if that Hydropical water
        run as it were within a skin, to the declining side of your <i>Amalgama</i>,
        add more of your Body to it, till you see that sign no more; and
        drying it thorowly, as is said, and rather chuse to lean to the
        other side, then to this, for there is nothing more irksome to
        an Artist in his Scholarship, then to wait for his signs beyond
        the time. </p>
      <p><i>Dry up thy moisture with heat most temperate.</i> <br>
        <i>Help Dissolution with moisture of the Moon,</i> <br>
        <i>And Congelation with the Sun, then hast thou done.</i> </p>
      <p>When thou hast done this, then be sure to decoct it in a very
        gentle Fire till it be dry, not by exhaling the Water, but by
        coagulating it with the Body, in which thy main care must be,
        that thy Vessel be close, and thy Fire gentle: Now the way to
        distinguish a gentle from a violent Fire, is a thing deeply
        concealed by the envious, I shall prescribe some few rules. </p>
      <p>1. Know that it is the internal Fire of the <i>Sulphur</i> of
        thy Water, which doth perform the whole work. </p>
      <p>2. That the external Fire is but an outward circumstance, which
        yet is so absolutely necessary, that nothing can be effected
        without it. </p>
      <p>3. The Regimen of the Fire is one Linear decoction, from the
        beginning to the end of the Work, boiling the thick, and
        subliming the thin, and so dissevering both (<i>suaviter &amp;
          cum ingenio</i>) according to old <i>Hermes</i>. </p>
      <p>4. All our Mastery consists in Vapour, which cannot be done
        without Sublimation and Distillation; for if our Spirit ascended
        not in a living form, it would all ascend and hang; but
        ascending quick, it returns again and moistens the Body. </p>
      <p>5. Our Distillation or Circulation, is not without a constant
        motion of Separation; for as the subtle is prepared from the
        gross by Sublimation, so the thick of that which is below is
        severed from the thin, which is by continual boiling and
        decocting, without a moments intermission: Therefore, saith <i>Hermes</i>,
        thou shalt sever the subtle from the gross, and the thick from
        the thin. </p>
      <p>6. Our tender Spirit learns every day more and more to suffer
        Fire; and therefore, saith <i>Arnold</i>, boil it with a Fire
        daily increasing: yet is it but one degree of Fire, and that is
        boiling, till the Womans Empire is vanquished; and then there is
        another degree, and that is roasting, which hath tow periods,
        Fixation and Calcination: therefore say Philosophers in the
        beginning, <i>Coque</i>, that is, Boil, for as much as the
        Stone is moist; and at the end they say, <i>Assa</i>, that is,
        Roast, for then the Stone is dry. </p>
      <p>7. The periods of the strength of the Fire are in this time
        many: every day if thou canst, augment it a little, that it may
        increase insensibly, and you will find the effect more sweetly
        and speedily. </p>
      <p>8. The Philosophers in their descriptions of the Fire, and its
        degrees, did more observe their matter and its capacity, then
        the Fire it self. </p>
      <p>9. They chiefly liken their Work to Man’s Generation, and so
        they call their Compound, Man: therefore saith <i>Ripley</i>,
        remember Man is the most Noble Creature. </p>
      <p>10. This is the true meaning of Arnold’s four degrees of Fire,
        <i>Primus formetur ut sensus ei dominetur</i>; that is, the
        Stone being compared to Man, and its first moist Regimen to a
        Bath; the first degree makes it sweat gently, as a Bath to a
        Man, which is less hot then he can suffer, doth cause a gentle
        sweat. <i>Sensibus aequato gaudet natura secundo,</i> is the
        second degree, in which sweat is exceedingly caused, as a Bath
        which is as hot as a man can possibly suffer, causes a most
        violent sweat. Tertius excedit &amp; cum tolerantia laedit, is
        the third degree, which causeth bubbling and swelling, and
        answers to that heat which will blister a mans hand; for our
        Compound in this heat riseth in blisters, which fall and rise
        continually. <i>Destructor sensus gaudet procedere quartus</i>,
        is the fourth heat of Congelation, which takes away sense, that
        is, quickness, and brings in siccity, just as the cauterizing
        heat sears the flesh, and drys the moisture. Thus hiddenly did
        that subtle Sophister veil his Fires. </p>
      <p>11. Know that after 40 or 46 days continually boiling, the
        moisture will begin to waste, and the Compound will begin to
        dry; which thou shalt know, in that the boiling will begin to
        turn to a swelling, like to a Puff-paste or Leavened-dough. </p>
      <p>12. Know that in 36 days thou mayst have thy moisture begin to
        congeal, if thou be exact in thy fire, and Proportions both
        inward and outward. </p>
      <p>13. Know that thy Glass must be thick, and very strong, and no
        less strongly closed, lest it break with those winds which the
        first decoction will raise in thy Vessel. </p>
      <p>14. Let its neck be somewhat long, and fastned, that the motion
        which is in the Glass may not cause it (by reason of the length
        and thickness of the neck, and the Sublimation that is still in
        it, in drops which make it heavy) to sway the little Body one
        way or other; for if it incline, the Matter will be apt to grow
        to the inclining side, which should be avoided. </p>
      <p>15. Let the neck be considerably cooler then the other part,
        that thy Vapours may condense in it, which else will burst the
        Glass violently; so mayst thou give thy Fire more strong then
        otherwise, and let thy nest be guarded from unnecessary heats
        and colds, which therefore would have holes at the top of the
        Cover, which may shut over every Glass, and let out a part of
        the neck, which would be very advantageous both for the fastning
        of the Glass, and condensing of Vapours. </p>
      <p>16. This boiling will begin in the first three days, and if you
        be a good Work-man, in the first 24 hours; and from its first
        ebullition your time is to be reckoned. </p>
      <p>17. When you see the Water thicken in its boiling, there is
        less danger of the Fire. </p>
      <p>18. If your Fire go out, your Stone dies. </p>
      <p>19. Every intermission of your Fire, is a wasting both of its
        strength and virtue; and besides the most tedious protraction of
        time, it makes the Stone subject to many Sicknesses, which would
        require a most subtle Philosopher to amend, and it lays your
        Stone in danger of having a return of the Crows Pullet to their
        nest, after they are fled, which is an ominous sign. </p>
      <p>20. Your Gold is not totally lost before blackness perfect; yet
        it may be so metamorphosed, as to puzzle the best Mechanick to
        reduce it, and then it is never so full of Spirit as it was
        before. </p>
      <p>21. Yet some of it will be lost in a short decoction, and most
        of it in thirty days. In a Fire then governed according to these
        Rules, dry up thy moisture; and that thou mayst dry up the
        moisture of thy Water, thou must dissolve the Compages of thy
        Body, so then thy Water dissolves thy Body, and thy dissolved
        Body re-congeals it self by a further decoction, which in
        dissolution was so untied as to make one with it. </p>
      <p><i>Four Natures into a fifth so shalt thou turn,</i> <br>
        <i>Which is a Nature most perfect and temperate.</i> </p>
      <p>Thus shalt thou turn thy four qualities in which were
        repugnancy, into a fifth which is temperate; that is, thou salt
        in this driness of Calcination, reconcile the <i>Mercury</i>
        with its qualities of cold and moisture, to <i>Sulphur</i> with
        its qualities of heat and driness, so shall thy Exhalations
        remain at the bottom, and thy exhalations shall cease, and the
        moisture being daily terminated into driness, by the ferment of
        the Body, as Milk by Runnit is terminated into Cheese, thou
        shalt have a middle product, partaking of the complexion of
        either Parent. </p>
      <p><i>But hard it is with thy bare foot to spurn</i> <br>
        <i>Against a bar of Iron, or Steel new acuate;</i> <br>
        <i>For many so do which be infatuate,</i> <br>
        <i>When they such high things take in and,</i> <br>
        <i>Which they in no wise understand.</i> </p>
      <p>Thus we have plainly and faithfully done our duty, and by a
        Line as it were dissevered the Truth from Falshood; yet we know,
        that in the World our Writing shall prove as a curious edged
        Knife; to some they shall carve out Dainties, and to others it
        shall serve only to cut their Fingers: yet we are not to be
        blamed; for we do seriously profess to any that shall attempt
        this Work, that he attempts the highest piece of Philosophy that
        is in Nature; and though we write in <i>English</i>, yet our
        Matter will be as hard as <i>Greek</i> to some, who will think
        they understand us well, when they misconstrue our meaning most
        perversely: For is it imaginable that they who are fools in
        Nature, should be wise in our Books, which are testimonies unto
        Nature? </p>
      <p><i>In Eggs, in Vitriol, or in Blood,</i> <br>
        <i>What Riches ween they there to find?</i> <br>
        <i>If they Philosophy understood,</i> <br>
        <i>They would not be in working so blind,</i> <br>
        <i>Gold and Silver to seek out of its kind:</i> <br>
        <i>For like as Fire of burning principle is,</i> <br>
        <i>So the principle of gilding is Gold I wis.</i> <br>
        <i>If thou therefore intend for to make</i> <br>
        <i>Gold or Silver by craft of our Philosophy,</i> <br>
        <i>Thereto neither Eggs nor Blood thou take,</i> <br>
        <i>But Gold and Silver, which naturally</i> <br>
        <i>Calcined wisely, and not manually,</i> <br>
        <i>A new Generation will forth bring,</i> <br>
        <i>Increasing its kind as doth every other thing.</i> </p>
      <p>Some I know will serve my Book as they have served others, out
        of it they will read their own fantastick processes, which I
        never dreamt of, nor yet are they in Nature; and whatever I
        write most plainly, they will Allegorize, and say it is true,
        for matter of Operation he wrought well, but withal very
        enviously and mysteriously: he calls the matter <i>Gold</i>,
        and <i>Mercury</i>, but that is but allusively; but he meanst
        Egg-shells calcined, or Vitriol, or Mans Blood, or Dew, or
        Rain-water, or Salt-peter, or Nitre, or Tartar, or this or that,
        according to their sordid fancy, and so they will proceed,
        nothing unsettle in their fancies by what I have candidly
        written. Gross Sots, thus to think that I in what I without any
        equivocation call <i>Gold</i> and <i>Mercury</i>, they should
        make to allude to such trifles: it is the sign of an Owl to
        blunder, by how much the Sun shines clearer; let me therefore to
        satisfy the Ingenious, profess and protest, that without any
        Allusion or Figure in speaking, our matter is Gold, even the
        purest that is sold, or can be bought; this is our Masculine
        Sperm. And our other principle is Mercury, like to that which is
        commonly sold, in form, in flux and colour, only it is brighter,
        and somewhat more ponderous; and without any Metaphor we call it
        <i>Argent vive</i>. In the making of this <i>Mercury</i> is all
        our secret, and in the Regimen of the Fire according to its
        capacity, consists the whole mastery. O fools and blind! Think
        you to gather Grapes of Thorns, or Figs of Thistles? Wherefore
        do you thus waste your Goods, proceeding in your Work, as an Ass
        to his Crib, never considering the nature of the thing you go
        about? If Gold and Silver be your intention to produce, in what
        would you find them? In Eggs, or Blood, in Salts, or such
        things? What a madness is this? To what end think you these
        operations will tend? What conformity is there between what you
        seek, and that which you take in hand? Do you not consider the
        difference of imposition between those Subjects, and Metals? How
        do you think that they should give weight to imperfect Bodies,
        when as they themselves are far more light themselves? How can
        you expect from them a specifick perfect Metalline Tincture,
        which have not any thing Metalline in them? You see not your own
        madness. It is no light matter to cause a Body, which perhaps is
        10 or 12 parts at the least in 16 defective of the dimensions of
        Gold, to penetrate its own dimensions so many times, to answer
        your fond desires. This which you attempt is to force Nature,
        and to create Sperms, both which are vain to undertake, and
        truly impossible. Leave then this Sophistry, and imbrace true
        Light. To create Sperms is Gds alone property, and everything
        hath its own Sperm, as it hath its own Form: there is nothing
        that hath a feminine virtue applicable to two things, every
        thing hath its own Seed, and according to its own Form. Gold
        therefore and Silver being thine intention, let the same be thy
        subject to work upon; Gold is thy first Basis, for thy white
        must first come out of thy red, and then thy white Stone is
        perfect, then mayst thou use <i>Luna</i> vulgar. Now Gold must
        have its hidden Seed extracted, and that is done by <i>Mercury</i>
        in Calcination, for that operation is the Mineral Copulation, in
        which the Seeds are sent forth and mingled together, then shall
        the old Body die, and a new Body shall rise again, endowed with
        a multiplicative virtue, according to the nature of all things;
        for it favours rankly of absurdity and ignorance, to allow all
        things almost a multiplicative power, and to deny it to Gold,
        the most perfect of all sublunary things. </p>
      <p><i>And if it true were that profit might be,</i> <br>
        <i>In things which are not Metalline.</i> </p>
      <p>But some will say, How will you answer the Philosophers, who
        affirm that their Stone is in all things, though in some things
        nearer, and in some things at greater distance, yet in all
        things according to the rule of (<i>propinquius &amp; remotius?</i>).


        To such I answer, I grant and know that all things originally
        owe all their principal material unto Water, and their formal
        unto Light; and according to the congress of these two
        principles, through the command of the Architect, this Light
        doth illuminate the material Water in a singular way, according
        to the Ideal species which were before in the Archetype; so then
        the Matter resides in Water, the Informing in Light, and the
        determination of the Form, which is as I may say the Form’s
        formality, is in the will of the Creator, first impressed or
        sealed in the word (<i>fiat,</i>) and ratified in his command (<i>producat



          unumduodque juxta speciem suam.</i>) Now to apply this to our
        present purpose, in Water and Light all things agree, in the
        determination of Illumination they differ, This determinative
        sentence of the Almighty, sealed a great variety in the products
        of Matter and Form, which are in themselves general, and being
        thus sealed, not any thing can pass from its kind to mix with
        another kind, but it will cause a product partaking of either
        Parent, nor can mixture be made but in the same genus or
        species; as an Apple may be graffed on a Crab-tree, a Man may
        (though abominably) mix with a Beast (<i>licentia naturali</i>)
        but out of <i>genus</i> or <i>species</i> nothing can mix.
        There are also many particular exceptions of things in one <i>genus</i>,
        for many Trees I know which the Art of man cannot ingraff one in
        another, so as to grow, will yet grow well ingraffed elsewhere;
        so a Dog and a Mouse cannot mix, being one so disproportionate
        to another. But this by the by. </p>
      <p>To return to our intention, we say, that as all things are by
        the will and power of God specificated, so with the destruction
        of that <i>species</i>, the Form (as to that individual)
        perishing, (for no intire <i>species</i> can perish) things may
        both by Nature and Art return to their first stable principle
        material, which is Water, of which Nature, if it be found in a
        convenient place, might (impregnating it with a Metalline Seed)
        produce a Metalline Sperm, or viscosity, which then might be a
        Metal by decoction, and yield unto our work a profitable
        subject. </p>
      <p><i>As in Blood, Eggs, hair, urine, or Wine,</i> <br>
        <i>Or in mean minerals digg’d out of the Mines,</i> <br>
        <i>Yet must that Element be first purified and seaparate,</i> <br>
        <i>And with Elements of perfect Bodies be desponsate.</i> </p>
      <p>So then if thou canst (as by the Liquor <i>Alcahest</i> thou
        mayst) reduce a Body (be it what it will, whether Eggs, or Hair,
        or Urine, or a Spirit ardent, or any mean Mineral which is not
        of a Metalline imposition) to Water, and after knowest how to
        impregnate that Water with a specificated, seminal, influential
        Light, so that that Water may penetrate its dimensions at the
        least 16 times, and become a Mineral, Mercurial Juice; thou
        mayst then expect as much profit from that <i>Mercury</i>, as
        from the best <i>Mercury</i> that is sold in the Apothecaries
        shops, and no more; for thou mayst so purifie it, and separate
        its faeces and crudities, as that it may become fit to joyn with
        thy perfect Bodies: but I doubt this way will be so hard, (try
        it when thou wilt, I fear the first will puzzle thee all thy
        life long, to turn all Bodies into Water, and the next would
        puzzle all the Devils in Hell, to bring this Water to a
        Metallick seminal viscosity) that thou hadst better leave musing
        on these Impossibilities, and take my counsel, that is, seek it
        there where Nature hath put it. </p>
      <p><i>But first of thine Elements make thou Rotation,</i> <br>
        <i>And into Water thine Earth turn first of all,</i> <br>
        <i>Then of thy Water make Air by levigation,</i> <br>
        <i>And Air make Fire; then Master I will thee call</i> <br>
        <i>Of all our Secrets great and small:</i> <br>
        <i>The wheel of Elements then hast thou turn’d about,</i> <br>
        <i>Truly conceiving our Writings without doubt.</i> </p>
      <p>Take of they clean <i>Mercury</i>, which is animated according
        to what I have faithfully taught in my little Latine Treatise (<i>Introitus



          apertus</i>), and mix it with thy Body, as there I told you,
        without ambiguity; put it in a Glass, as I there advised, and
        govern it with a Fire, as I in that Treatise ordered, and thou
        shalt see thy Elements circulate; first thou shalt see thy
        Elements circulate; first thou shalt have thy Gold dissolved,
        which thou shalt know by thy first sign, which is a whiteness
        which will arise like a skin in boiling upon the Water. This
        Water will be made aerial, by subliming in a continual Vapour;
        for by constant and continual Sublimation, our Stone is
        inspired, and takes life in the Air, and lives, and shews the
        actions of life, and a living Water or Dew shall from the top of
        the Glass descend upon the lower grounds, and make them
        fructifie; then shall beautifie thy Vessel with changeable
        colours, Citrine, pale blewish and blackish: This is the Fire of
        Radical <i>Sulphur</i>, which when it is once stirred up, is
        like unto the Fiery Dragon, and <i>Ignis Infernalis</i>; by
        this thou mayst know that the Heaven and the Earth, the Form and
        the matter, the Male and the Female are now beginning
        Conjunction: when thou seest this sign, rejoice, for know that
        now thy Bodies are made in greatest part no Bodies; and this if
        thou dost work well, will be in 30 or 36 days. </p>
      <p><i>This done, go backwards turning thy wheel again,</i> <br>
        <i>And into Water turn thy Fire anon,</i> <br>
        <i>Air into Earth, else labourest thou in vain.</i> </p>
      <p>Now know, that all our three Circulations are so called not
        without great reason, for so indeed they go on as a Wheel; put a
        Nail in a Wheel, and turn it, and you shall see the nail will
        with one half of your turning ascend, and the other half
        descend: And then that Circulation is compleat, and you then
        must go on to another Circulation. </p>
      <p>These our Circulations are Solution and Congelation,
        Volatilization and Fixation, opening and shutting; when once
        thou hast brought thy Body to the height of Subtiliation, that
        the Spirit by decoction can being to it, then the Spirit hath
        done its work, and ceaseth then to be active; then begins the
        dissolved Body to work after its own kind, and then the Spirit
        is passive, and the Body active; thus passive Natures are made
        active, and active passive, which is the key of out Mastery.
        First then, advance the Spirit above the Body, till the Fire be
        discovered, which is in a yellow colour; then advance the Body
        over the Spirit, till the Earth again appear, which is in a
        colour blacker than Pitch; which first will begin with blewness,
        and his will decline daily more and more unto blackness. This
        yellow colour remember that it comes with a moisture of the
        Compound, otherwise what you do is all in vain: turn it then
        into Water, that is, let this yellowness appear <i>in humido</i>,
        till by opposition from the terrene qualities there be engendred
        a blewness, then continue this decoction till all be intirely
        black, for in gross moisture heat working, engenders blackness,
        with such like gross colours. </p>
      <p><i>For so to temperament is brought our Stone,</i> <br>
        <i>And Natures contractions four, are made one;</i> <br>
        <i>After they have three times been circulate, Also thy Base
          perfectly consummate.</i> </p>
      <p>Thy Air must be thickned with the Body, which is terrene and
        gross, being not yet putrified, and by this means the Fire and
        the Air, and the Earth and Water will accord; for Air will agree
        with Water, and Earth with Fire: The Air being then tempered
        with Earth, doth by this reconcile the Water and the Fire. Thus
        our first decoction confounds the Elements, and thus our Stone
        which was of severed qualities, is brought to a temperateness.
        Thus by a natural Circulation, the Quadrangle is made a Circle,
        and four qualities make a fifth, which is a Neuter from the
        four, and yet partakes of all, This first Conjunction natural,
        which is made in the Glass without laying on of hands, which we
        call Triptative, is the ground of the last Tetraptive
        Conjunction, which is made in the turning round of the three
        Wheels, which doth perfect the Stone. </p>
      <p><i>Thus under the moisture of the Moon.</i> </p>
      <p>Govern then thy Bath first with a moist Fire, until the Body be
        made no Body, but a flying Spirit; this is the time of the
        Womans reign, and it is attributed to the <i>Moon</i>: for our
        Gold till it be dissolved, all the work depends only upon the
        active virtue of the Water, which causeth the slow appearance of
        our signs. </p>
      <p><i>And under the temperate heat of the Sun,</i> <br>
        <i>Thy Elements shall be increate soon,</i> <br>
        <i>And then hast thou the Mastery won.</i> <br>
        <i>Thank God thy Work was so begun:</i> <br>
        <i>For then hast thou one token true,</i> <br>
        <i>Which first in blackness to thee will shew.</i> </p>
      <p>When thou hast by thy first Waters Pontick virtue and firiness,
        so far dissolved thy Body as to set at liberty its internal <i>Sulphur</i>,
        then thy Operations will be speedy; for the <i>Sulphur</i> of
        the Water, together with the natural <i>Sulphur</i> of thy
        Gold, by mixture will make an unnatural Fire, which will then
        burn like to the Fire of Hell, first making a total end of that
        dissolution which was but in part made by the Water, and after
        that drying up and congealing its own moisture, and the moisture
        of the Water, uniting the <i>Sulphur</i> of the <i>Sun</i> and
        the <i>Sulphur</i> of the Water, and the <i>Mercury</i> of the
        <i>Sun</i> and the <i>Mercury</i> of the Water, and the united
        <i>Sulphur</i> prevailing over the united Humidity, rotting it
        into powder as small as Atoms, black of the blackest black, thou
        shalt then see a total mixture of Seeds, and death of thy
        Compound. This rotting will begin about the 42, 46 or 50th day;
        and the signs of it are, the Fumes will not ascend, but the
        Matter will boil at the bottom of the Glass, like to melted
        Pitch, boiling and bubbling, swelling and puffing in a black
        colour, every day blacker and blacker, shewing changable rotting
        colours in its boiling. This will continue till it be so thick,
        that it boil not, but grow hard and swell; yet it will vary
        often, and appear sometimes as though dry, and sometimes a
        little moisture will appear, with fresh bubbling, but no Fumes.
        And this will last about 46 days, no Fumes rising at all, so
        that about the 84th or 90th day, after thy Matters begin to be
        boiled in a continual decoction, Putrefaction will be compleat,
        and then Sublimation or Circulation will begin again, which in
        46 or 50 days will end in a white Dove. </p>
      <p>This first token of blackness proclaims thee a Master, after
        which thou canst not well miss, unless thou wilt. This is the
        astonishment of Art, to make Gold volatile, which was so fixed:
        be patient then, and boyl continually till your Gold begin to
        dissolve, and come upon the water like a Cream. Then continue
        your decoction till the colour begin to change into an imperfect
        Citrine, with moisture, and send up yellowish vapours. This
        Citrine will soon be mixed with a blewish black, and yet
        continue your boyling, till breath fail, that is, the Clouds and
        Fumes arise no more; then the Compound boyl at the bottom
        without Fumes, and will shew dark, obscure, reddish, yellowish,
        blewish, gray and blackish colours; then continue your decoction
        till the Body and whole Compound begin to rot into Atoms, which
        the 50th day will give you a Harbinger or fore-runner of, with
        Pitchy blackness; then know that all is thorowly mingled
        together and will never cease till the damned Earth come, the
        Earth of Leaves, which is a dust impalpable. </p>
      <p><i>The Head of the Crow taken do call we,</i> <br>
        <i>And some do call it the Crowes Bill,</i> <br>
        <i>&nbsp;Some call it the Ashes of Hermes Tree;</i> <br>
        <i>And thus they name it after their will,</i> <br>
        <i>Our Toad of the Earth which eateth his fill.</i> <br>
        <i>Some call it by what is mortificate,</i> <br>
        <i>Our Spirit with Venom intoxicate.</i> <br>
        <i>But it hath names I say to thee infinite;</i> <br>
        <i>For after each thing that blackness is to sight</i> <br>
        <i>Named it is, till time it waxeth white;</i> <br>
        <i>Then hath it names of more delight,</i> <br>
        <i>After things that been full white.</i> <br>
        <i>And the red likewise after the same,</i> <br>
        <i>After all red things doth take the name,</i> <br>
        <i>At the first Gate, &amp;c.</i> </p>
      <p>This token then is called the Crow, the Crow’s Head, and the
        Crow’s Bill, for it is a shining blackness, like unto Printers
        Ink, or a solid Coal new broken, or the most black and compacted
        broken Pitch. </p>
      <p>Others name it the Ashes of <i>Hermes</i> Tree, for it is
        Ashes out of which grows a Tree afterwards, beautiful and
        glorious with Sprigs and Branches, and changeable colours. </p>
      <p>And indeed this liberty the Philosophers have taken, to call it
        what they list: they call it their Toad which crawleth on the
        ground, and feedeth upon the slime of the earth; because before
        it is quite black, it may resemble the colours of a Toad, and
        its likeness, puffing and swelling, and rugged with bunches and
        blisters, and knobs. </p>
      <p>Others call it a Spirit killed with its own deadly poison, that
        is, <i>Mercury</i> dissolving Gold, in which dissolved Body
        (which then seems a Spirit) there is hidden ferment, which may
        recongeal the same: this fermental virtue it is that doth
        coagulate or thicken the Water, that to the wonder of Beholders
        what before was thinner and thinner, doth after 40 days thicken,
        till it come to a dust or powder like to impalpable Atoms. </p>
      <p>But I shall not insist upon these denominations, there being so
        many given to it by the Envious, that there is nothing almost in
        the World that is black, or may be made black by the Fire, but
        they have named it by it. Also whatever is filthy or faeculent,
        or unsavoury either to taste or smell, they have Allusively
        called their Stone by, in reference to its first putridness or
        corruption. So likewise when by continuance of decoction the
        colour changeth to white, they then call it their Swan, their
        Dove, their white Stone of Paradise, their white Gold, their
        Alabaster, their white Smoak, and in a word whatever is white
        they do call it by. And so the Rd they name their Vermillion,
        their red Lead, their Poppy of the Rock, their Tyre, their
        Basilisk, their red Lion, and in sum it borrows the names of all
        red things. </p>
      <p>Now thou art entred the first five gates of the Philosophers
        Castle; for do not believe but that Calcination is verily
        Putrefaction, and is done by Dissolution, Separation and
        Conjunction, as if thou hast attended this discourse thou mayst
        easily conceive: only here is the Sophism, after this total
        Calcination, there is relenting again; for as I said before, our
        Operation is but turning as it were of a Wheel, which runs one
        half of its circulation directly backwards to its first
        progress. Thou sublimest so long, till the Body is made as
        volatile as it may be, this is the activity of the Spirit; then
        thou congealest so long, till all appear like Atoms, and then is
        thy bodily virtue active, and thy Spirit passive; then thy
        Spirit begins to be active again, and thy Compound which was
        apparently fixed, relents again and distils as before, till it
        come to its height again of volatility, which is again a
        Separation; then is celebrated again a Conjunction Tetraptive,
        and from that time all ascends and descends together, and there
        is such an union, that there doth not then (as at first) exhale
        a quick Fume, and descend upon the bodily Moles, but all ascends
        like to a glorious tree with branches, and is not sublimed to
        the top, but sprouts up like the tender Frost in a fair morning,
        which falls and rises till all become a Powder impalpable. So
        then after Calcination is again a Solution, and that divides
        between <i>Azoth</i> and <i>Laton</i>, and a distilling
        Separation in which <i>Azoth</i> washeth <i>Laton</i>; and
        after that a Conjunction, not of the four Elemental qualities
        only, which was in the first Conjunction, but of the Elements
        themselves, the Body, Soul and Spirit; and then is made another
        Calcination into a white Calx, which by continual decoction
        relents again, and is made volatile again: for our Wheel goes
        round, and when it is come thither whence it set forth, it
        begins again. Thus is made a third Solution, Sublimation and
        Calcination into a red <i>Elixir</i>, which is the Sabboth of
        Nature and Art; at which being arrived, there is no farther
        progress without a new Marriage, either by Ferment or otherwise,
        according to the rule of Nature and Art: so that indeed all our
        work is three Rotations, and every Rotation hath three Members,
        Solution, Sublimation, and Calcination. The first Solution is
        called Inceration, and Reduction or Liquefaction, the second
        properly Solution, the third Inceration. The first Sublimation
        is called Distillation, Ascension and Ablution, the third
        Exaltation and Sublimation. The first Calcination is called
        Calcination and Conjunction Triptative, Putrefaction, &amp;c.
        The second Congelation, Albification and Fixation, the Third
        Illumination, <i>&amp;c</i>. only remember, thou in thy first
        Calcination attainest compleat Putrefaction, in the second the
        compleat White <i>Elixir</i>, and in the third the compleat
        Red. This I premise to undeceive thee, that thou mayst not think
        to have a Calcination first, a Dissolution next, a Separation
        thirdly, a Conjunction fourthly, a Putrefaction fifthly, <i>&amp;c</i>.
        No verily, when thou first putteth thy Matters into the Vessel,
        in the first day of thy Operation, thou givest a Fire in which
        thy Compound boileth, swelleth, and puffeth visibly, and drops
        down in veins off from the Convex of thy Glass; for in this <i>Mercury</i>
        thy Gold will, beyond the nature of any other <i>Mercury</i>,
        flow in the Fire as if the whole was <i>Mercury</i>, and boyl
        visibly, which must never cease, not a moment, for it brings
        imminent damage. In the first days of your boyling, which is
        accompanied with a constant ascending and return of Fumes, your
        Compound grows more and more liquid, now and then a skin
        appearing in the form of a distinguishable, though not very
        observable, whiteness. At length a yellowish colour will appear,
        less at first, and more afterwards distinguishable, both in the
        boyling Compound below, and in the Fumes above; and when thou
        seest thy Glass as if it were all over gilded, where the Fumes
        ascend with a blewness, then know that thy Man and Wife do mix
        their Seeds, then shall an obscure greenness pass and continue a
        season, then shall thy Fumes diminish, and at length be none at
        all, and the Compound shall boyl and swell in the bottom of the
        Glass. </p>
      <p>After that, the more you boyl, your Compound will be the more
        black, coming at last to the temper of melted Pitch for colour
        and bubbling, which shall rot with obscure colours until it come
        to the period of Putrefaction, which is a most exquisitely
        subtle, black, unctuous Powder, which about the 84th or 90th day
        in a good decoction will be compleat. </p>
      <p>Take heed now, for I shall not make such another particular
        Systeme of the Work in all my Writings. When the fullness of
        compleat Calcination is perfect, then will the parts begin to
        liquefie together again, and you then shall see Vapours begin to
        arise again, first like to a Smoak, which will after return in
        drops condensing on the Vessel sides, which believe me is a
        gallant sight; for in this Operation as blackness by little
        wears away, such colours will appear which thou canst not
        imagine, that thou wilt steal from Natures due to satisfie thine
        eyes in the beholding of it, when thou shouldest sleep. </p>
      <p>This Circulation with infinite variety of colours will last
        between 20 and 30 days, and then thou shalt see thy Matter
        appear pretty white, which then will grow whiter and whiter,
        till it become like a glittering Sword in the Sun-beams: trust
        me, for I have seen this shining sparkling white, which yet will
        be quick like a most glorious Heaven-born <i>Mercury</i>, the
        subject of wonders. </p>
      <p>Then shall these Fumes begin to cease, and thou salt see a
        Congelation, like to the sparkling twinkling eyes of Fishes,
        which moving uncessantly on the fire, will glitter incomparably
        and wonderfully, and thickening more and more, it will sprout
        like a tender Frost in a most amiable luster, and in 25 das
        shalt thou have it a most impalpable undiscernable Powder. Now
        thou needest no farther instruction, only this let me tell you,
        that the continuing your Glass in the Fire, and increasing it
        discreetly, this white will relent again, and change into a
        perfect green, and will again circulate and become perfect
        Azure, and at the length thicken, and in the end become (after a
        long Citrinity) in a moment a sparkling red pure impalpable
        powder. Understand this well, and you will not be amazed any
        longer with the distinction of our Operation, which is but
        Solution (which contains Separation or Sublimation and
        Volatilization) and Coagulation, which contains Conjunction,
        Calcination and Fixation; and all is but a successive action and
        passion of Gold the body and his qualities, and <i>Mercury</i>
        the Soul and its qualities, between which intercedes a Spirit of
        Life, which carries them up and down like a Wheel, which turns
        till it returns thither whence it proceeded, and then begins
        again and turns so long till it finds its rest, which is in the
        Fiery <i>Cathedra</i>, the red of the reddest, the great <i>Elixir</i>
        commanding all Metals, and reducing them to the highest period
        of nature, which is Gold it self, having attained a <i>plusquam</i>
        perfection, through the marvelous co-operation of Art and
        nature. </p>
      <p>Thus Gold is thy Base of Foundation, the Centre to which all
        thy operations return, and in which they rest, for they are but
        Circulations in their own kind, and these Circulations are
        uncessantly carried along through the never-ceasing action of
        the Fire, which a little intermission would retard notably, an
        extinction of the heat would extinguish it irrecoverably. If any
        then should ask us, what our natural Operation of the Stone is;
        we would answer, a making of active Natures passive, and passive
        active, by continual decoction. We boyl continually, and when
        the Spirit is active there is a constant ascension and
        descension, and the Body is dissolved and made to fly like a
        Spirit; and when the Body is active, the Fumes by little and
        little cease, and the Compound remains below, boiling without
        fuming, thickning and then a length calcining: and this is
        without hands repeated three times, the Fire only being kept
        continually, and then a Sabboth of rest and perfection is
        attained: in the mean time divers colours come and go, which the
        dying Body and vegetative Soul do work and cause. Trust me,
        Friend and Brother, thou never hadst such a manuduct as this in
        thy life, the Reasons of my plainness my little Latine treatise
        doth clearly shew. </p>

      </p>
      <p><i>Of Dissolution now will I speak a word or two,</i> <br>
        <i>Which sheweth out what erst was hid from sight,</i> <br>
        <i>And maketh intenuate things that were thick also,</i> <br>
        <i>By virtue of our first Mestrue clear and bright,</i> <br>
        <i>In which our Bodies eclipsed been of light,</i> <br>
        <i>And of their hard and dry compaction subtilate,</i> <br>
        <i>Into their own first Matter kindly retrogradate.</i> </p>
      <p>Having run through the Chapter of Calcination, I now come to
        handle Dissolution, which as I said before, is the first
        beginning of the Spirits activity, and it is the first half of
        the Wheel which turns up the Spirit, and down the Body; the
        second hath a contrary operation, for it makes the Body active,
        and Spirit passive: so then Calcination hides the profundity of
        the Body, which Solution discovereth. It is then nothing else
        but a boiling of hard and dry Bodies in our <i>Mercury</i>, in
        a convenient Fire, so long till they be dissolved and made thin;
        then the same Fire makes them fly and flying they condense and
        return in drops on the Body, and moisten it: This is Solution
        and Sublimation together, for the Water circulating upon the
        Body, doth soften it, and by often returning both at length
        bring it to its own nature of moisture. In this Resolution,
        according to <i>Artephius</i>, the <i>Sun</i> loseth its
        colour and is darkned, and the <i>Moon</i> doth not give her
        light, for all things are turned into their confused Chaos, or
        first Matter, in which the Elements with their qualities are
        hurried together. </p>
      <p><i>One in Gender they be, and in Number two,</i> <br>
        <i>Whose Father is the Sun, and the Moon the Mother;</i> <br>
        <i>The mover is Mercury: These and no more be</i> <br>
        <i>Our Magnesia, our Adrop, and none other</i> <br>
        <i>Things here be, but only Sister and Brother:</i> <br>
        <i>That is to mean, Agent and Patient,</i> <br>
        <i>Sulphur and Mercury co-essential to our intent.</i> </p>
      <p>The cause of this is the Homogeneity of the matter, wherein
        they agree in essence, together with the difference which is
        between them in Sex, they being in the Glass as Male and Female;
        and in ripeness of years one being more mature, and by
        consequent more active, (to wit, the <i>Sun</i>, who therefore
        is the Father) the other more crude (in comparison of the Sun)
        and so more passive,<i> viz</i>. the Moon, which therefore is
        the Mother of our Stone. This Mother is our <i>Mercury</i>
        (which for its eminent difference from any other <i>Mercury</i>,
        is called the <i>Moon</i>) with its internal true <i>Sulphur</i>,
        which is hidden under its <i>Mercurial</i> form, doth first
        move; for at first our Body, which is Gold, is dead, and liveth
        not till it be quickned by our <i>Mercury</i>, then it lives:
        it behooveth thee then to put in thy Body and thy Water, and let
        them stand together, and add nothing to them. This Composition
        duly made we call our <i>Magnesia</i>, and our <i>Adrop</i>,
        and nothing entreth, neither Powder nor Liquor, save only these
        two <i>species</i>, which <i>species</i> are the perfect Body
        and <i>Argent vive</i>. </p>
      <p>These two sprung out of one Root, for as I told you, the Soul
        of thy animated <i>Mercury</i> is perfect true Gold, yet
        volatile, which by Art may be made to appear in a fixed form: so
        then we joyn Consanguinity with Consanquinity, Brother with
        Sister, and make them become together Man and Wife. These two by
        continual Fire do act and re-act, the Woman first, and then the
        man, several, which then are joined and make one Hermaphrodite,
        acting one half of each Circulation as a Woman or Spirit, and
        the other half as a Man or Body. </p>
      <p>For each of the two principles have a <i>Sulphur</i> and a <i>Mercuriality</i>;
        the Gold or Body hath its <i>Sulphur</i> external and apparent,
        the <i>Mercury</i> the Spirit hath it internally hidden, yet
        both these are co-essential to each other, and in that respect
        they are the only subjects in the World for our Art. </p>
      <p><i>Between these two in quality contrarious.</i> <br>
        <i>Ingendred is a mean most marvelous,</i> <br>
        <i>Which is our Mercury and Menstrue unctuous;</i> <br>
        <i>Our secret Sulphur working invisibly,</i> <br>
        <i>More fierce then Fire burning the Body,</i> <br>
        <i>Dissolving Metals into Water Mineral,</i> <br>
        <i>Which Night for darkness in the North we do call.</i> </p>
      <p>For with their Homogeneity, they have withal such a Contrareity
        in opposite qualities, that they do no sooner feel the Fire, but
        they are stirred up to Work, and boiling and circulating in a
        continual Ebullition or Vapour, they do mingle their homogeneal
        qualities together: by reason of which there is a strange <i>medium</i>,
        of an unnatural Fire and a putrefying Bath ingendred, then the <i>Sulphur</i>
        or Fire of the Gold, which is the Fire of Nature, and the <i>Sulphur</i>
        of the Water, do embrace one another, and these two make an
        unnatural Fire, in which the Humidity appears, and the <i>Sulphur</i>
        being hidden to the eye, appears in its effects only to sight,
        and that is, it burns, destroys and conquers the Bodies, which
        common Fire never could do, making them to be no Bodies, but a
        Fume of Mineral Vapour; and in this Operation the Elements are
        confused, and make our Chaos which is void and dark, for here
        the Lights of the World are eclipsed, the Sun is darkned, and
        the <i>Moon</i> sheweth not its light: which watrishness of the
        Compositions, for its abundance of moisture, and privation of
        light, we call Winter, and Night, and the North Latitude of our
        Stone. </p>
      <p><i>But yet I trow thou understandst not utterly, the very
          secret of Philosophers Dissolution,</i> <br>
        <i>Therefore understand me, I counsel thee wittily,</i> <br>
        <i>For the truth I will tell thee without delusion,</i> <br>
        <i>Our Solution is caused of our Congelation;</i> <br>
        <i>For Dissolution on the one Side corporal,</i> <br>
        <i>Causeth Congelation on the other side spiritual.</i> </p>
      <p>When once thou hast the true mastery of our Dissolution, thou
        needest take no care for Congelation, for governing it on with
        thy Fire, thou shalt attain Coagulation without any laying on of
        hands. Therefore saith <i>Ricardus</i>, above all things it is
        wonderful, that in our work, Calcination, Dissolution,
        Sublimation, Putrefaction, Separation, Conjunction, Death and
        Purification, should be performed in one Vessel, and one linear
        decoction, without laying on of hands: for verily the
        Dissolution of the Body thickens the Spirit, as it is in Water
        in which Gum or such a thing is dissolved; for by how much the
        one is dissolved, the other is congealed: this proves the
        naturality of our Work, for as a grain of Corn is in the bowels
        of the Earth softened with moist Vapour, and swelleth thereby,
        this Vapour is also terminated by the fermental odour of the
        Grain, and so both grow up together into Stalks and Ears. </p>
      <p><i>And we dissolve into Water which wetteth no hand;</i> <br>
        <i>For when the Earth is integratly incinerate,</i> <br>
        <i>Then our Elements are so together concatenate,</i> <br>
        <i>That when thy Body from its first form is alterate,</i> <br>
        <i>A new form is induced immediately,</i> <br>
        <i>Since nothing being without all form is utterly.</i> </p>
      <p>So we in our Work dissolve our body, which is Gold, in its own
        Water, in which it is softned as a Seed in its proper ground,
        and being softned it relents into Water, not diaphanous, such as
        is the Water of the Clouds, or of Fountains, but Mineral, even <i>Mercury</i>
        which wetteth no hand, nor cleaves to any thing but that which
        is of its own substance and essence. </p>
      <p>So that in our Work, our two Principals work not according to
        their single dispositions, but as conjunct; the one, saith the
        Philosophers, dyeth not without its Brother: therefore when thou
        calcineth the Earth, thou dost in it and with it calcine the
        Water, and in this the Souls of both are tyed together, to the
        end that they may serve the wise Philosophers. Therefore let all
        thy study be to unite Natures, which thou canst never do, unless
        thou separate first their Souls by Sublimation, and afterwards
        unite them in blackness, which a continual Circulation of thy
        Water upon the Earth will produce. </p>
      <p>Now know, that when thou seest thy Water and thy Body boil
        together, so as to thicken one another, and to congeal one
        another, that then thy science is true, and then thy Body which
        thus thickens, is not the same which thou puttest in, but a
        middle coagulate, a <i>terra Adamica</i>, a <i>Limus</i> and <i>Chaos</i>,
        for one form being taken away, a second necessarily follows
        immediately; for as no Body can at any time have more than one
        form, so can it never be void of all form. </p>
      <p><i>And here a secret I will to thee disclose,</i> <br>
        <i>Which is the ground of our secrets all,</i> <br>
        <i>And it is not known thou shalt but lose</i> <br>
        <i>Thy labour and costs both great and small:</i> <br>
        <i>Take heed therefore in error that thou not fall.</i> <br>
        <i>The more thine earth, and the less thy moisture be,</i> <br>
        <i>The faster and better Solution shalt thou see.</i> </p>
      <p>And here take notice by the way, that that is no total
        Dissolution which is before Calcination, but only partial, the
        Water resolves as much as it can of the Body, so much that it
        doth sever between its Spirit and Body; but by reason of its
        perfection and strong compaction, it finds a great deal of
        difficulty before a total Resolution, and therefore it putrefies
        what is most gross, and thus brings it to Atoms, which when it
        is once subtilized beyond the exigency of its own nature, it
        then is dissolved, and relents, and then Dissolution is made
        totally, viz. after Putrefaction. Then at length it becomes all
        like a glorious <i>Argent vive</i>, and this immediately before
        the Lunary Coagulation: Know then that our first loosing is into
        a viscous Powder, which is brought on by Incrudation, or rather
        Liquefaction, for know that till after Putrefaction, our Stone
        and Compound is moist in the Fire, but hardens more and more by
        how much the colder it is, and softens more and more by how much
        hotter it is, and the heat slacking, the boiling will change
        into a seeming Vegetation, ad the Fire going out, it is hard
        rather than soft, yet the mingling of the natures is known by
        the colours, and drawing to Calcination. Therefore thy first
        Operation is to dry up thy superfluous watrish moisture, not
        evaporating it, but congealing it on the Body. Think not them,
        as some of the envious Sophistically write, that the more you
        put of your Water, the sooner you dissolve, and congeal the
        flower: No verily, your Calcination is but the <i>medium</i> of
        True Solution, which is (trust me) not total nor proper till
        after Putrefaction. I should never have told thee this Mystery,
        had not the love of my Neighbor compelled me, That opening of
        the Body which is before, is but an opening of its pores, which
        lets our Water in, and then after death and resurrection the <i>Mercury</i>
        of <i>Sol</i> is visible to the eye, which before was but
        indistinguishable by its effect. </p>
      <p><i>Behold how Ice to Water doth relent,</i> <br>
        <i>And so it must, for Water it was before;</i> <br>
        <i>Right so again our Water to Earth is went,</i> <br>
        <i>And Water thereby congeal’d for evermore:</i> <br>
        <i>For after all Philosophers that ere were bore,</i> <br>
        <i>Each Metal once was Water Mineral,</i> <br>
        <i>Therefore with Water they turn to Water all.</i> </p>
      <p>So then our Body hath moisture in it self, but this moisture is
        sealed, as Water when frozen by the Cold. But when the pores of
        the Body are by our Water opened, and its central Fire set at
        liberty. This internal Fire of Nature makes the Body to become
        no Body, but a very Spirit. </p>
      <p>In this same Operation the Spirit is congealed, for the Body
        hath in it ore virtue then its two Sociats, that is, than the
        Soul and Spirit. This is the action and re-action of our Body
        and its Water, for our Body is in its <i>occulto Mercury</i>,
        and our <i>Mercury</i> in its <i>occulto Sol</i>; therefore
        they embrace each other, because of the nearness of their
        natures, and so the Body hath its profundity discovered, and the
        Water its altitude, and both together are glorified in one
        Spiritual Body together, according to <i>Noble Hermes, Vis ejus
          est integra si versa fuerit in terram</i>. But thou canst
        never have this excellent fixity, till the fixed have attained
        its volatility. </p>
      <p><i>In which Water of kind occasionate.</i> <br>
        <i>Of qualities been repugnance and diversity,</i> <br>
        <i>Things into things must therefore be Rotate,</i> <br>
        <i>Until that Trinity be brought to perfect Unity.</i> </p>
      <p>This Water into which our Bodies are first liquefied, is not
        properly Water, but (<i>modo quodam</i>) as we may say in the
        Fire. During the predomination of the Woman, all appears in a
        moist posture, and so will do most part of the first 50 days;
        yet this is a gross moisture, and by consequence the more fit
        for Putrefaction: in which gross Humidity all the elements are
        in a confusion, not the Elements of the great World, but our
        Mineral Elements; thou must therefore work by a continual
        boiling, in which thy Compound will appear like unto the stormy
        Sea in a Tempest, raging and swelling, waves and bubbles rising
        one in the neck of another incessantly. The Vapour of this Bath
        being imprisoned, condenseth and returns every moment, until
        there be an union made of all the Elements, in a <i>terra
          Adamica</i>, or <i>Limus</i>. Then will the Body, Soul and
        Spirit remain below in the bottom of the Vessel, which is as a
        Tomb, in which they dye and rot, and are purified. </p>
      <p><i>For the Scripture recordeth when the Earth shall be</i> <br>
        <i>Troubled, and into the deep Sea shall be cast</i> <br>
        <i>Mountains and Bodies likewise at the last.</i> </p>
      <p>Then will our Earth be moved, and the powers of our Heaven will
        be shaken, and the windows thereof opened, and an universal
        Deluge will come upon the face of the whole Earth, which will
        destroy all things, and cover the highest Mountains, so that all
        Flesh shall dye: these Waters will be a long time upon the face
        of the ground. </p>
      <p><i>Our Bodies be likened conveniently</i> <br>
        <i>To Mountains, which after high Planets we name;</i> <br>
        <i>Into the deeps therefore of Mercury</i> <br>
        <i>Turn them, and keep thee out of blame,</i> <br>
        <i>For then shalt thou see a noble game,</i> <br>
        <i>How all will become Powder as soft as Silk;</i> <br>
        <i>So doth our Runnit kindly curd up our milk.</i> </p>
      <p>Thus have many of the envious allegorized of the Scripture, and
        veiled their Work under several passages and overtures which are
        mentioned therein, to which they have some resemblance: that
        have called their Metals <i>Sol</i> and <i>Luna</i>,
        Mountains, either for the situation sake, they being generally
        found in Mountains, or by opposition sake, for as Mountains are
        highest above ground, so they lye deepest under ground; or for
        that as the mountains are nearer the Sun, so those do
        approximate nearer to coelestial Influences than any other
        Bodies whatsoever: so also they have stiled them by the names of
        Planets, by reason of some similitude. </p>
      <p>But it makes not so much for the name, the thing is, take the
        Body which is Gold, and throw it into <i>Mercury</i>, such a <i>Mercury</i>
        which is bottomless, that is, whose center it can never find but
        by discovering its own; govern them wisely with Fire, as they
        Matter requireth, then shall thy Gold visibly liquefie in the
        Fire, that is, appear thin as if it were <i>Mercury</i>, and it
        will swell, bubble and boil, so long till the moisture be
        terminated by the Body into an impalpable Powder, as naturally
        as Runnit doth curdle Milk into Cheese. This total reduction
        into Atoms, is the perfection of Putrefaction, in blackness most
        black, and it begins before the 50th day, and endeth before or
        about the 90th day, in variable colours. </p>
      <p><i>Then have thy Bodies their first form lost,</i> <br>
        <i>And others been indued immediately,</i> <br>
        <i>Then hast thou well bestowed thy cost,</i> <br>
        <i>When others uncunningly must go by,</i> <br>
        <i>Not knowing the secrets of our Philosophy.</i> </p>
      <p>Then thou hast a Body, not such a one as thou puttest in, but
        Hermaphroditical, which yet hath but one form. Nor is it the
        same form it had, though an accidental imperfect one in the same
        kind; which imperfect form is not to be despised, for these
        Ashes are the Tomb of our King. Honour then the Sepulchre of him
        and of his Queen, if ever thou expect to see them returning from
        the East in power and great glory. Never grutch it then that
        thou hast destroyed thy Gold, for he that thus destroys it,
        loseth it not, but soweth good Seed in good Earth, from whence
        he shall receive it with an hundred-fold increase: when as he
        that saveth his Gold in this Work, loseth his labour, and is
        deceived for lack of true understanding, when as he undertakes
        this Work without the true knowledge of its causes. </p>
      <p><i>Yet one point more I must tell thee,</i> <br>
        <i>How that each Body hath dimensions three,</i> <br>
        <i>Altitude, I attitude, and also Profundity;</i> <br>
        <i>By which all Gates turn we must our Wheel.</i> </p>
      <p>Having then this Mystery, which is the Stumbling-block at which
        thousands stumble, who cannot for all their talk destroy their
        Bodies, which is not to be done but by the <i>Alkahest</i>,
        which is an unprofitable way for our Work, and by our <i>Mercury,


          viz</i>. in 40 days, or thereabouts: Then know which must be
        your next progress, for Calcination is but a term put on our
        Work by Authors, and it reacheth to the end of Putrefaction, our
        first Calcination. I told you before, that all our Work was
        compleat in three Circulations, and every Circulation had three
        periods; so now I tell you, that these three periods are
        Altitude, Latitude and Profundity: Altitude and Profundity being
        united, make Latitude, and so our Wheel is turned round: the
        Profundity is the Water below, the Altitude is Vapour or Waters
        above, and the union of these two is in a Calx, which is
        Latitude; which is done by Liquefaction, Sublimation and
        Calcination: Liquefaction dissolves and confounds, Sublimation
        volatizeth, separates and washeth, and Calcination unites and
        fixeth. </p>
      <p><i>Knowing that thine entrance in the West shall be,</i> <br>
        <i>Thy passage forth to the North if thou do well,</i> <br>
        <i>And there thy Lights will lose their lights each deal,</i> <br>
        <i>For there must thou abide for 90 nights,</i> <br>
        <i>In darkness of Purgatory without lights.</i> </p>
      <p>Thou must begin in the West, and in the Autumn, which is
        Barren, for then Crops are gathered; take then thou Gold, which
        is the Harvest of Natures works, and it is batten of it self; to
        make it fruitful thou must bring on the Winter showrs, which is
        the North Latitude, and by these the Earth will be made mellow,
        and the Seeds will rot; which Seeds are <i>Sol</i> terrestrial,
        in whose belly is a hidden <i>Luna</i>. These Lights will in
        this Operation be darkned, and by little and little a horrible
        Night will over-shadow the Earth and Heaven, a blackness like
        unto Pitch: this blackness and Eclipsation will continue until
        the end of thy first three months, perhaps 100 days, perhaps
        120, yea sometimes 130 days, as it may fall out; think not this
        time long, for it must be that thy Matters must be purified,
        before they can or shall be glorified. </p>
      <p><i>Then take thy course up to the East anon,</i> <br>
        <i>By colours rising variable in manifold wise,</i> <br>
        <i>To the East therefore thine ascending devise,</i> <br>
        <i>For there the Sun with day-light doth uprise</i> <br>
        <i>In Summer, and there disport thee with delight.</i> </p>
      <p>Then shalt thou see thy Exhalations to return again, and by the
        continuance of them on thy Body, light shall begin to appear,
        which is our Spring and East season, in which as the rising Sun
        saters the darkness with multitude of previous colours,
        especially in a misty morning; so is it with our Work, such
        admirable colours will appear, as never were seen by the eye of
        man in so little a room before. Then rejoice, for now our King
        hath triumphed over the miseries of death, and behold him
        returning in the East with the Clouds in power and great glory.
        Now the Night is overgone, and the Morning breaks; the Winter is
        past, and the Spring comes on pleasantly, with sweet showrs of <i>April</i>,
        hastning the most beautiful Flowers of <i>May</i>. Now as the
        Winter is a sad time, being cold and wet, frosty and slabbery,
        the Countries of Pleasure being dirty to the Horse belly, but
        the Spring returns the year, and pleasure with its sweet season:
        so in our Work, the first Operations before blackness seem
        tedious, for thou wilt think there will never be an end of it;
        so variety of colours brings delight in its daily and hourly
        variety, even to perfect whiteness. </p>
      <p><i>Forth from the East into the South ascend,</i> <br>
        <i>And set thee down there in a Chair of Fire,</i> <br>
        <i>For there is Harvest, that is to say, an end</i> <br>
        <i>Of all this Work after thine own desire,</i> <br>
        <i>There shineth the Sun up in his Hemisphere.</i> <br>
        <i>After the Eclipses in redness with glory,</i> <br>
        <i>As King to reign over all metals and Mercury.</i> </p>
      <p>Here thou mayst light and bait, and enjoy the glory of thy
        white Elixir, but do not, for thou hadst better wait the end.
        Proceed then with a Fire a little more increased unto the Summer
        of South quarter, where after some colours, as green, yellow,
        azure, and the like, thou shalt have a sparkling red, like unto
        the flaming Fire. Then thou art come indeed to thy harvest, and
        to the end of all thy Operations; for now thou beginnest by
        apparent colours the uprising of the Sun, after it hath been so
        long beclouded and eclipsed; now hast thou mourned long enough,
        now the time is come that thou shalt need no more to mourn, for
        the Bridegroom is now come forth out of his Chamber, and the Sun
        comes forth as a valiant Champion to win a prize: now is the
        time come in which that of the Poet is fulfilled; </p>
      <p><i>Ne te poeniteat faciem luligine pingi.</i> <br>
        <i>Adferet haec Phoebi nigra favilla jubar.</i> </p>
      <p>Now hath our King of peace attained his Kingdom, whose
        Government is, <i>parcere subjectis &amp; debellare superbos</i>;
        for whatever is infected our King will cure, what is lame he
        will heal, and what is rebellious he will suppress and subdue. <i>Sic


          Reis ad exemplum totus componitur orbis</i>. </p>
      <p><i>And one Glass must be done all this thing,</i> <br>
        <i>Like to an Egg in shape, and closed well.</i> </p>
      <p>Now all these our Operations, as the Philosopher saith, are
        done in our secret Fire, hidden Furnace, and in one Vessel; for
        I thou thinkest to make any of these Operations with thy hand,
        thou art in a certain of errour. Our Vessel then, which for
        similitudes sake we call an Egg, must be so closed when our
        Materials are set in it, that the Spirits cannot possibly get
        out, nor the Air get in, else our Work were spoiled. </p>
      <p><i>Then must thou know the measure of Firing,</i> <br>
        <i>The which unknown thy Work is lost each deal.</i> <br>
        <i>Let never thy Glass be hotter then thou mayst feel,</i> <br>
        <i>And suffer still in thy bare hand to hold,</i> <br>
        <i>For fear of losing, as Philosophers have told.</i> </p>
      <p>This done, we then set our Vessel and Matter to the Fire, and
        let it stand untouched till the Work be done: so that the
        Philosopher hath nothing then to do but behold his Glass, and
        the Operation in it, and to govern his Fire artificially. </p>
      <p>So then when once the Stone is set to work, the whole mastery
        is to govern the external Fire, which as the Philosopher doth
        either perfect or destroy all: if thy Fire be too slow for want
        of motion, thou wilt hardly ever see an end; and if too big,
        thou mayst happen to seek thy fortune in the Ashes. </p>
      <p>Be not therefore immoderate in governing; and for better
        security, let not your Glass neck be under a span in length, but
        as much longer as you shall see good; the longer as you shall
        see good; the longer for a <i>Tyro</i>, the better he shall
        work, and with the more security. But the usual length which we
        use, is about 12 or 14 inches high; this height being so
        allowed, order so your Furnace as to let out about 3 or 4 inches
        of the top of your Glass, which may come forth through the cover
        of your <i>Athanor</i>, and if you can without hurt feel or
        suffer any part of that neck, fear not your Fire, but stew him
        without fear, your Glass being strong, and the quicker Fire the
        better. </p>
      <p>Yet know, that your Furnace must be answerable, for do not
        believe that Philosophers did formerly use our Art of Furnaces,
        but made them of Brick, or Earth, with Earthen Covers, which had
        holes for letting out part of the necks of their Glasses, over
        which if they put a Cover, which they could remove and set on
        again at their pleasure; this Earthen Cover was not so
        reflective of heat, as our Iron Covers are, but that end of the
        Glass which came out at the hole of the Cover, they could feel
        without any damage, and by their being able to suffer that in
        their hand, they judged the temperament of their heat. Therefore
        in thy Furnace let thy Cover or Top be luted with good Loam
        everywhere, at the least half an inch thick, so shalt thou be
        sure not to have too scalding a heat in the concavity of thy
        Nest, which otherwise thou wouldst have, so mayst thou govern
        thy Fire at thy pleasure; the necks of thy Glasses which come
        forth, thou needest not cover: so shalt thou see this of <i>Ripley</i>
        verified, thy Work will go on very successfully, and thou wilt
        ever be able to endure thy Glass in thy hand; and this is the
        true meaning of all Philosophers, to give a certain rule by
        which thou shalt never exceed, and that is so long as you can
        endure to feel any part of thy Glass, provided thy Nest be
        covered, and the ends of thy Glass necks come forth. </p>
      <p><i>Yet to my Doctrine furthermore attend,</i> <br>
        <i>Beware thy Glass thou ever open ne meeve,</i> <br>
        <i>From the beginning till thou have made an end;</i> <br>
        <i>If thou do otherwise thy Work may never cheeve.</i> <br>
        <i>Thus in this Chapter which is but brief, &amp;c.</i> </p>
      <p>And that this is according to the sence of all Wise men, is
        evident by their testimony in general, and the following words
        of Ripley; See (saith he) that thou open not thy Glass, nor move
        it, from the beginning to the end of the Work. So then this
        feeling of the Glass, it must be such as may be without opening
        or moving of the same; for if the Seed be disturb’d in its
        beginning to vegetate, the Work is undoubtedly spoiled, or at
        least it will be so notably weakned, that it will hardly afford
        thee thy true Signs in thy due. </p>
      <p>Therefore when thou settest in thy Egg in thy Nest, take heed
        of meddling with it until the Mastery be attain’d, but with a
        Wyre or some such thing, or with a hole in thy Cover, stay the
        neck of thy Glass from jogging this way or that, which otherwise
        it will be very subject to. </p>
      <p>Thus have I briefly run through this second Gate of
        Dissolution, which is indeed one with Calcination and
        Separation; for by a constant Sublimation, is made a Solution of
        the Body, and at length a Congelation of Spirits, for they by
        oft ascending, come to that pass that they will ascend no more,
        but remain at the bottom of the Vessel together, which is
        Conjunction they swell, bubble and boil, till they calcine and
        putrefie. The black Earth, impalpable like Atoms of the Sun,
        being the highest degree of Putrefaction: and this is a secret
        not so clearly discovered by any before. </p>
      <p><i>The Sun is set, no wonder darkest Night</i> <br>
        <i>Doth veil the Crystal Skie:</i> <br>
        <i>The Moon’s eclips’d, no marvel that her light</i> <br>
        <i>Doth from us hidden lie.</i> <br>
        <i>The Sun’s declined to the Northern Pole,</i> <br>
        <i>And O the change that’s made!</i> <br>
        <i>The pearly drops are turned to a Coal,</i> <br>
        <i>All brightness quite doth fade.</i> <br>
        <i>In this Apollo bright, whose glory did</i> <br>
        <i>A luster great display?</i> <br>
        <i>In this fair Phoebe, who ere light was hid,</i> <br>
        <i>Did shine as bright as day?</i> <br>
        <i>Is this the King whose glory and renown</i> <br>
        <i>Did shine as bright as day?</i> <br>
        <i>Is this the King whose glory and renown</i> <br>
        <i>Through all the World did ring?</i> <br>
        <i>Is this the Queen who far and near was known?</i> <br>
        <i>Oh ‘tis a wondrous thing,</i> <br>
        <i>Such glory and such beauty thus should fade!</i> <br>
        <i>That what before did shine</i> <br>
        <i>More bright then Tagus, should so soon be made</i> <br>
        <i>More foul then ere ‘twas fine!</i> <br>
        <i>The Earth doth melt, the Heavens drop down rain,</i> <br>
        <i>The Rocks which do relent,</i> <br>
        <i>They seem like Water, then condense again</i> <br>
        <i>Till all their moisture’s spent.</i> <br>
        <i>To Ashes they return, for Dust they were,</i> <br>
        <i>This Dust from Water springs;</i> <br>
        <i>Therefore at length they melt to Water clear,</i> <br>
        <i>Which all to Spirits brings.</i> <br>
        <i>The Nest is Earth, therefore they will congeal</i> <br>
        <i>To sparkling pearly dew,</i> <br>
        <i>Shining like tender Pearl, on which doth steal</i> <br>
        <i>A Body dry and new.</i> <br>
        <i>And then the parts like Atoms of the Sun</i> <br>
        <i>For fineness do appear:</i> <br>
        <i>Rejoyce, for now thou half thy course hast run,</i> <br>
        <i>Nor hast thou cause to fear.</i> <br>
        <i>Proceed until thou see the sparkling red,</i> <br>
        <i>Oh happy sight to see!</i> <br>
        <i>By which unto the Royal Palace led,</i> <br>
        <i>Thou shalt aye happy be.</i> <br>
        <i>Happy are they who shall not miss to find</i> <br>
        <i>The new uprising Sun:</i> <br>
        <i>More happy they who with renewed mind,</i> <br>
        <i>In God find rest alone.</i> </p>

        <br>
        <br>
      </p>
      <p><i>Separation doth each part from other divide,</i> <br>
        <i>The subtle from the gross, the thick from the thin;</i> <br>
        <i>But manual Separation see thou set aside,</i> <br>
        <i>For that pertains to Fools, which little fruit doth win.</i>
        <br>
        <i>But in our Separation Nature doth not blin,</i> <br>
        <i>Making division of qualities Elemental,</i> <br>
        <i>Into a fifth degree till they be turned all.</i> </p>
      <p>Having now run through two of the twelve Gates, I am come to
        the third, which is Separation, which begins so soon as the
        Matters have been so long circulated, as to begin to hold one of
        another. This Operation the Ancient Sages have denominated
        Division of Elements, which afterwards they say must be joined
        with a perpetual union. This separation is by others called
        Extraction of natures, and the parts separated are compared to
        two Dragons, the one winged, and the other without wings. </p>
      <p><i>Artephius</i>, who for Age and Candor was next to <i>Hermes</i>,
        the most eminent, calls this Separation the Key of the Work,
        which according to him is a Sublimation in a continual Vapour,
        that what is Heavenly and subtile, may ascend aloft, that is, to
        the upper part of the Vessel, and there take the nature of a
        Body heavenly, or Spirit; and what is gross may remain below, in
        the nature of a Body earthly, which is the end of our mastery,
        to bring the Bodies which are compact and dry, to become a
        spiritual fume, which is only to be done by Sublimation, and
        Division or Separation. </p>
      <p>So then our Separation is not to be understood, as many foolish
        Alchymists do interpret it, who have their Elements of which
        they boast much, which are indeed manual, done by handy-work,
        the Glass being removed, altered or renewed every time. Nor are
        our Separations made by filter, or <i>per tritorium</i>, as
        many imagine, who know not the nature of our Work, and therefore
        run into such foolish fancies. </p>
      <p>Nature then in our Work doth all in all, who as a curious
        Artificer maketh no confused mixtures, but first of all causeth
        the moisture to ascend, which because it cannot get out, it doth
        therefore condense in drops, and descends so long till at length
        it begin to be actuated from the Body, which is below; for
        naturally all homogeneal moisture, cohobated on a bodily
        substance, with which it hath affinity, is actuated by it. Gold
        them is a Body in which the active qualities of heat and
        driness, are more than in the <i>Mercury</i>, and the <i>Mercury</i>
        being cohobated on it, begins to be a little more Fiery or hot,
        and then the Exhalations are more Aerial, which before were more
        Watry, and by continued Cohobation the Water partakes yet more
        and more of the <i>Solary</i> nature, until at length this heat
        or <i>Sulphur</i> impregnating the <i>Mercury</i>, cause it to
        congeal into a new Body or quintessence, which is after the
        corruption of the old Body, which is called the Earth, or Ashes
        of <i>Hermes</i>’s Tree. </p>
      <p><i>Earth is turned into Water under black and bloe,</i> <br>
        <i>And Water after into Air under very white,</i> <br>
        <i>Then Air into Fire, Elements there be no moe,</i> <br>
        <i>Of these is made our Stone of great delight.</i> <br>
        <i>But of this Separation much more I must write;</i> <br>
        <i>And Separation is called by Philosophers definition,</i> <br>
        <i>Of several qualities a Tetraptive dispersion.</i> </p>
      <p>So then this is the method of our Operation, Earth, that is
        Sol, is boiled in our <i>Mercury</i>, in such a heat in which
        the <i>Mercury</i> may ascend constantly in a smoak, and
        descend in drops, and the Body below stand liquid and boil: then
        shall the Water dry up, under which is blackness hidden, which
        when the Water is dryed up shall appear like the Crows Bill. </p>
      <p>Then shall this Powder again relent and after 40 days rotting
        without fumes, shall send up a smoak again, which shall ascend
        and descend so long, till the whole be made volatile and Aerial;
        then shall the black colour vanish, and the white appear. </p>
      <p>This white <i>Argent vive</i>, or <i>Mercury</i> animated,
        which appears after blackness, shall then totally congeal, and
        shall be then Fire, whose Nurse is the earth; then hast thou the
        four Elements, that is, cohobated thy Natures to the highest
        degree of perfection of the white Stone, then canst thou go no
        further, but go back and turn the same Wheel till thou hast
        attained the red Stone. Thus hast thou the true Principles and
        Operation of our great <i>Elixirs</i> both red and white, which
        if thou once hast, thou hast Riches enough, and needest no more
        in this life. </p>
      <p>This, if no more were said of this point, might be enough to
        shew thee the truth of our Separation: yet because Philosophers
        have spoken much of it, and indeed it is all the work to cause
        ascension and descension of our true Water on our true Body, so
        long till by the Water the Body be volatilized, and after that
        by the Body the Water fixed; and till that be brought to pass,
        there will come and go the Four Qualities in their season, and
        will cause change of colours suitable to their station, pleasant
        to the Philosopher to behold. </p>
      <p><i>Of this Separation I find a like figure this spoken:</i> <br>
        <i>So out of our Stone precious if thou be witty,</i> <br>
        <i>Oyl incombustible and Water thou shalt draw,</i> <br>
        <i>And thereabout thou needest not at the Coles to blow.</i> </p>
      <p>These Philosophical Operations some have had the fancy to
        compare with some passages of Scripture, but I had rather bound
        Philosophy within its own Pale, and not allegorize the Holy
        Scripture thereto, where Philosophy is not understood there. </p>
      <p>To the thing in hand; by continual decoction our Work will
        shew, as in Circulation, a real change of the ascending
        Humidity; the first will be white, and so continue a long time,
        which is called Water or Phlegm, and after it the Water will be
        coloured, and ascend so on the sides of the Vessel, which is
        called Oyl; and this Oyl is not combustible, for it is the true
        <i>Sulphur</i> of <i>Gold</i>, and therefore as permanent as
        the <i>Mercury</i>. </p>
      <p>Yet be no mistaken, nor do not imagine that because we speak of
        incombustible Oyl, that our Work is to be performed with the
        Fire of a Wind, Oven, or of Bellows, (as some foolishly imagine)
        to burn up what is combustible, until the very incombustible Oyl
        be left, for all our volatile subject is turned into
        incombustible fixity, with a moderate decoction in our secret <i>Athanor</i>,
        whose heat in its highest vigoration is but very obscurely red,
        hardly perceptible, and in its lowest degree is not full half so
        strong, or half at the most. </p>
      <p><i>Do this with heat easie and nourishing,</i> <br>
        <i>First with moist Fire, and after that with dry,</i> <br>
        <i>The Flegm with patience out-drawing,</i> <br>
        <i>And after that the other Natures wittily:</i> <br>
        <i>Dry up thine Earth until it be thirsty,</i> <br>
        <i>By Calcination, else labourest thou in vain,</i> <br>
        <i>And then make it drink up the moisture again.</i> </p>
      <p>This is a heat which is friendly to the Bodies, for it causeth
        the Spirit to ascend, and yet suffers it to return, and by
        reason of its ascending and returning, the Matter below stands
        continually moist, and boileth with a perpetual motion and
        exhalation, which ascends and returns day and night every hour
        and minute without intermission. </p>
      <p>This moist Air, or liquid form at bottom, with Ebullition and
        sending forth a spiritual smoak or Vapour, (in which, saith <i>Artephius</i>,
        the whole Mastery consists) continues for six weeks, or
        thereabouts, and then the boiling will turn to a Pitchy
        swelling, and putting up like Leavened Dough; and from that time
        the Compound shall grow dryer and dryer, coming at length to
        Pitch-black Atoms, or Powder impalpable, and the fumes shall
        cease for six weeks. </p>
      <p>Be patient therefore in decoction, and wait with a great deal
        of confidence, until thou seest thy Water, which at first
        ascends white and flegmatick, to begin to change colour, and the
        Exhalations to arise discoloured within the Glass. Then continue
        your decoction till the Cloud which is conceived be brought
        forth: for in this Operation be sure that the Seeds begin to
        mingle, and will give you a sign of the beginning of the
        Conjunction of Natures, and that is the gilding of the Glass
        about the sides within the Concave, as if it were overspread
        with leaves of pure Gold. </p>
      <p>Continue still your decoction till the Earth at the bottom
        begin to appear, and the moisture of the Compound begin to be
        terminated in Dryness, in colour Black, which is a sure sign of
        your right progress, and without which you can never attain the
        Mastery. </p>
      <p>Remember that in this Calcination thou hast a portion of Water
        in the upper part of thy Vessel, which did not descend; and in
        time of the ceasing of the fumes, the Body grows very dry, even
        to Calcination, which when it is intirely perfected, the Water
        is as it were by a Magnetical virtue drawn down, and then
        follows a second Liquefaction. </p>
      <p><i>Separation thus must thou oftentimes make,</i> <br>
        <i>Thy Waters dividing into parts two,</i> <br>
        <i>So that the Subtle from the gross thou take,</i> <br>
        <i>Till the Earth remain below in colours bloe;</i> <br>
        <i>That Earth is fixed to abide all woe.</i> <br>
        <i>The other part s spiritual and flying,</i> <br>
        <i>But thou must turn them all into one thing.</i> </p>
      <p>But to return to our Work of Sublimation, which is as was
        touched before, the Key of the whole Work, by which Separation
        is made uncessantly each day and hour. </p>
      <p>Thus are the Waters divided from the Waters, that is, the
        Waters above from them which are below; for part of the Water
        ascends up like a fume, and congeals and runs down the sides of
        the Glass in drops like veins, and part remains still below with
        the Body, and with it boils visibly, and that uncessantly. </p>
      <p>By this Work thou hast the subtle or thin parts of the Body,
        and the thin parts of the Water, ascend and mingle; and the
        gross part of the Water, mixt below, the one by subliming
        together, and the other by boiling together: thus is thy Body
        below compounded of two even the most fixed parts of <i>Sol</i>,
        with the grosser parts of <i>Lunaria</i>; and thy Water of two
        parts, the Soul of <i>Sol</i>, and the Spirit of <i>Lunaria</i>,
        which is the true mystical ground of Fixation. </p>
      <p>Thus by fixating in a continual Vapour whatever is spiritual
        and heavenly, both in the Water and in the Body lightly
        ascending, and in the upper part of the Glass taking the nature
        of a Spirit, what is more gross, earthy and corporeal, will in
        the bottom take the nature of a Body, whose colour, the Soul
        being separated, will be as Black as Pitch. </p>
      <p>This Body is a middle substance between the Body and the Water,
        a <i>Limus</i>, a new Body, or <i>Adamica terra</i>, a medium
        between fixed and not fixed; it is not so fixed as to be equal
        to <i>Sol</i>, nor yet so volatile as the <i>Mercury</i>, but
        it is sufficiently fixed to endure a Fire requisite for this
        Work, and to suffer all the pain and woe of this our Purgatory,
        in which it abides six weeks without fumes or vapour. </p>
      <p>But as for the Spirit, that is a tender thing, nor is it able
        to endure the Fire, but flys from it, and abides in the
        uppermost part of the Glass; only so long as the fumes arise,
        the ascending do still meet with them which are above, till at
        last making over great drops, they fall down; and when the fumes
        cease, as much of the Spirit as the Concave of the Glass will
        hold without running down, stays above until intire Calcination
        be perfected, and then they are drawn down by a Magnetical
        virtue: So that her is all the mystery of the proportion of the
        Glass to the matter, namely, that it be so big, and no bigger,
        as in its Concave will hold up a competent quantity of Water,
        (after Calcination to water the dry pores) while the Body below
        rots into Atoms. </p>
      <p>Then shall you bring back the Water upon the earth, and
        circulate again so long till there be a total joining, till the
        Spirit become the body, and the Body become a Spirit, and all be
        made true Fire or Tincture; of which Conjunction this true
        Separation is the cause, and without it it cannot be made. </p>
      <p><i>Then Oyl and Water with Water shall distill,</i> <br>
        <i>And through her help receive moving:</i> <br>
        <i>Keep well these two, that thou not spill</i> <br>
        <i>Thy Work for want of due closing,</i> <br>
        <i>And make thy Stopple of Glass meltng,</i> <br>
        <i>The top of thy Vessel together with it,</i> <br>
        <i>Then Philosopher lick it is up shit.</i> </p>
      <p>In this second Circulation, which is after Conjunction, there
        shall be no more the Body below and the Spirit above, but all
        shall be one, and the Body which is the <i>Sulphur</i>, shall
        always follow the Spirit on the Fire wherever it flys. The
        occasional cause of all this, is our first Water which though
        vile, is therefore to be much valued, for it is very precious;
        through the virtue of which it comes to pass, that our earth
        yields a Water, and causeth it to fly with the Spirit aloft, and
        is the Soul of our <i>Sol</i>, which at length doth allure the
        said Spirit and Body to union, which else would never be: and
        then the Body beyond its own nature is lifted up, moving
        uncessantly with the Spirit and Soul upon the Fire, for all now
        are made one inseparably; and this is called the <i>sealing the
          Mother in the belly of the Infant which she bore</i>, that is,
        the earth below is so united to the Water that arose from it,
        that in this Operation after this true Conjunction, they are
        never more divided, but are together sublimes, and descend
        continually, moving and altering continually until perfect
        Complement. </p>
      <p>Now for as much as all the Mastery consists in Vapour, which
        are called the great Winds, which are in the Vessel at the
        forming of this our <i>Embrio</i>. Therefore great care must be
        had lest the Spirits exhale. Which they will do, without the
        Glass have a strong guard; for first, they are subtle; nor that
        only, but ascend with a great impetus, by reason of our Fire,
        which must cause the <i>inferiora ebullire &amp; moveri
          continuo, &amp; inferiora ciculari, quolibet momento</i>; and
        thirdly, in Putrefaction the Body and Spirits have a most subtle
        odour, which also must be retained. </p>
      <p>For preventing of all, thou shalt have thy Stopple as firm as
        any part of thy Glass, which let it be strong, as is said, and
        the neck long and strong, and let the neck be melted up with a
        Lamp, or with Coals, and closed well without much wringing,
        which makes the Glass brittle; but being nipt up, and after that
        staying in the same heat, turning it to and fro in the clear
        heat, the Glass will come to as exactly close and smooth a <i>superficies</i>,
        as in any other place. </p>
      <p>This is the true and sure way which Philosophers have secured
        their Glasses by. Let it cool by degrees, and be very wary that
        it get no crack in cooling, which if it do so, though never so
        little, you must not connive at it, lest the winds within cause
        it there to burst, as being a weak defective place. </p>
      <p><i>The Water wherewith thou mayst revive thy Stone,</i> <br>
        <i>Look thou distill before thou work with it.</i> <br>
        <i>Oftentimes by it self alone,</i> <br>
        <i>And by this sight thou shalt wit,</i> <br>
        <i>From faeculent faeces when it is quit:</i> <br>
        <i>For some men can with Saturn it multiply,</i> <br>
        <i>And such like substance, which we defie.</i> </p>
      <p>Thus thou seest how our Work must be ordered in reference to
        its Regimen, but the main matter is our Water. Which Water, as
        saith <i>Artephius</i>, is the Vinegar of Mountains, and it is
        the only Instrument for our Work: its Preparation consists in
        Cohobation, which we will discover. In my little Treatise called
        <i>Introitus Apertus</i>, and in my other Tractate called <i>Ars



          Metallorum Metamorphoseas</i>, I speak as much of it as a man
        can speak, without giving a Receipt; but to the Ingenious, what
        there is written if far better than any Receipt. </p>
      <p>This I say, that it must first be cohobated in a very wonderful
        way, (for it is such a Cohobation that hath not its like in the
        World) and for several times, to a determinate number, and after
        it may and ought to be distilled per se, without any addition,
        again and again, that thou mayst have the Water clean from any
        Exotical mixture. </p>
      <p>When it ascends like to the pearled dew, thou mayst then know
        that it is sufficiently pure, which is not till all the
        filthiness be cast from the center, and wash’d from the
        superficies: Thy Water then hath so excellent a Pontick faculty,
        that it will dissolve <i>Jupiter, Saturn</i>, or <i>Venus</i>,
        into <i>Mercury</i> and <i>Sulphur</i>; for it commands Metals
        as their true Water Mineral, which no Mercury in the World is,
        but our Mercury, nor can be, for Reasons known to the <i>Adepti</i>,
        which if I should give, there would be none almost so stupid but
        that would easily apprehend them, for they are most
        demonstrable. This only I at present say of this <i>Mercury</i>,
        that it is the Mother of Metals, and therefore hath power to
        reduce them, by dividing their principles of <i>Sulphur</i> and
        <i>Mercury</i>; but we count it a loss to imploy our <i>Mercury</i>
        to such sordid uses, for we spoil the goodness of it hereby.
        Gold only is drowned in it, that is, it is reduced without
        division of parts; but through the <i>Sulphur</i> and <i>Mercury</i>
        be for a time distinct, yet they will joyn with the Water, and
        together, and so remain perpetually; which other Metals in their
        dissolution will not, for their <i>Sulphurs</i> being not
        perfect, are rejected to the superficies, and never are received
        to union again, for they are Heterogeneous. </p>
      <p><i>Distill it therefore till it be clean,</i> <br>
        <i>And thin like Water as it should be,</i> <br>
        <i>Like Heaven in colour bright and sheene,</i> <br>
        <i>Keeping both figure and ponderosity:</i> <br>
        <i>There with did Hermes moisten his Tree,</i> <br>
        <i>In his Glass that he made it to grow upright,</i> <br>
        <i>With Flowers discoloured beautiful to sight.</i> </p>
      <p>So then to return to what we digresses a little from, thy Water
        must be so long distilled, until it be very clean; for this,
        saith the Philosophers, is thy first work, to make clean thy <i>Mercury</i>,
        and then into clean <i>Mercury</i> put clean Bodies, for who
        can expect a pure Generation from that which is unclean? </p>
      <p>The next property of thy Water is, that it must be thin, even
        as thin as any other <i>Mercury</i>; for if the external
        proportion be corrupted, it is an evident sign that the inward
        nature is confused. </p>
      <p>It must also be of a very bright colour, even like to fine
        burnished Silver, as saith <i>Artephius</i>. Hence saith a
        certain Philosopher, that our Water to sight is like to a
        Coelestial Body. </p>
      <p>Our Water must not be reduced into any limpid Diaphanous
        liquor, as some fondly imagine, and as I my self in my time of
        errours did conceit, but it must keep its <i>Mercurial</i> form
        pure and incorrupted. It is also very ponderous, so ponderous
        that it is somewhat more weighty then any other Mercury in the
        World. </p>
      <p>This is the only one <i>Mercury</i>, and there is none in the
        whole World besides it which can do our Work: with this <i>Hermes</i>
        did moisten his Body, and made it to rot and putrefie. </p>
      <p>By means of this Water the Body shall be brought to have a
        vegetative Soul, for it will shoot forth as with Sprigs, and
        Leaves, and Branches, and after it will resolve into Powder like
        Atoms. </p>
      <p>In the time of this process many colours shall come and go,
        rise and set, which will be a pleasant spectacle to the
        beholder, and shorten the time wonderfully, which else would
        seem very tedious. </p>
      <p><i>This Water is like to the venomous Tyre,</i> <br>
        <i>And with it the mighty Triacle is wrought;</i> <br>
        <i>It is a poison most strong of ire,</i> <br>
        <i>A stronger poison cannot be thought,</i> <br>
        <i>Oft times therefore at the Pothecaries it is sought.</i> <br>
        <i>But no man shall thereby be intoxicate,</i> <br>
        <i>From time it is to Medicine Elixierate.</i> </p>
      <p>This Water is by Philosophers called their Venom, and indeed it
        is a very strong poison, to wit, to the Body of <i>Sol</i>, to
        which it is mixed: but what it is to the Body of man, I never
        tried my self, nor gave it to another, nor do I believe did any
        of they. But as concerning the Medicine that is made by it, and
        out of it, it is certain, that of all Medicines in the World it
        is the highest, for it is the true <i>Arbor vitae</i>, which
        doth answer the universal desires of them who have it in this
        kind; for besides its virtue Curative, which it hath in a
        wonderful miraculous way, it can penetrate even to our
        Consitutive principles, which no other Mineral Medicine can do.
        Though <i>Paracelsus</i> glory much of his <i>Renovantia &amp;
          Restaurantia</i>, (which we have known, as being master of his
        secret Alcahest, of which if I live I will write a particular
        Treatise) yet it is not his <i>Haematina</i>, nor yet his <i>Arcana</i>,
        nor his <i>Elixiria</i>, nor his <i>Essentiae</i>, nor any of
        his secrets, which are surely noble Medicines, that can reach
        the root of Life, which this can and will; for it performs all,
        only it cannot prevail against the appointment of God, otherwise
        were it not for that decree it could really keep a man immortal,
        for it renews Youth, retards Age, and restores to most exquisite
        and compleat health, encreaseth strength wonderfully; yea it
        will not only renew Hair to those from whom it is fallen, but it
        will change the hoary head into a youthful colour, which will
        not grow hoary again for many years, nor ever, if the use of it
        were fully known, and it were used as it ought to be. </p>
      <p>Hereupon in respect of its wonderful virtue, after it is made
        into medicine, Philosophers have by Analogy concluded, that it
        was before the greatest poison, for they have a maxim (<i>ex
          summo venemo, summa Medicina</i>) which as I do not always
        hold true, so I shall not here dispute. But he who thinks,
        because Philosophers say it is such a deadly poison, that it is
        to be bought at the Apothecaries, or Druggists, he is mistaken;
        for as it is first bought, I confess it is very venomous, but
        this malignity I conceive and know is fully taken away, before
        it become the Philosophers <i>Mercury</i>. </p>
      <p>But whatever it be in its Crudity, I am sure it is not so in
        its Perfection, for he who shall take of it then, shall be so
        far from receiving any damage by it, that he shall find it to be
        a soveraign Medicine, which hath not its like in the whole
        Universe. </p>
      <p><i>For then as is the Triacle true,</i> <br>
        <i>And in its working doth marvels shew,</i> <br>
        <i>Restoring many from death to life;</i> <br>
        <i>But see thou mingle it with no Corrosive,</i> <br>
        <i>But chose it pure and quick running,</i> <br>
        <i>If thou thereby wilt have winning.</i> </p>
      <p>It is not the Triacle of Galen, nor yet of <i>Hippocrates</i>,
        (which yet if right made are of great efficacy) that can compare
        to it; for first, it kills all the venom of any disease or
        malady, so that those diseases which do astonish the beholders,
        are by this overcome even ad <i>miraculum:</i> for suppose a
        man dying with the Tokens of the Plague, so that he is upon the
        very point of departure, (and the decree not past, for then
        there is no recovery) if he have but a drop of this <i>Elixir</i>
        poured down, so that he swallow it, he shall immediately
        recover, and in short time he will be restored to his former
        health. Now that it doth immediately reach the root of Life, I
        shall demonstrate: Suppose one with a very languishing disease
        be consumed to nothing in comparison, and for want of Spirits be
        just going out of the World, so the decree be not past, if he
        have but the strength even in the Agony of death, but to take a
        drop of this <i>Elixir</i>, he will recover and revive, and in
        a few days in comparison will be doubly stronger then ever he
        was before. Suppose one of a very weak Constitution, and sickly,
        and every day ill, feeble all over, if he take of this <i>Elixir</i>,
        it will in a short time alter his Constitution fundamentally, so
        that he shall be far stronger then any other man ordinarily is.
      </p>
      <p>A noble Philosopher (though I scarce believe him to be an <i>Adeptus</i>
        of the Stone) hath wrote of late a small Treatise of Fevers, the
        Lithiasis, and the Pestilence, and there he saith in one of his
        Tractates, That the loss of strength which is made by Venery and
        Bloud-letting, is wholly irrecoverable. It is true, and I verily
        believe that he had Medicines very noble, and it is pity but he
        had this secret to preserve his old age, for I seriously
        profess, that of all the Tractates that ever I read, they are
        the most Philosophical; but by this expression it is evidence,
        that he was ignorant of this secret. </p>
      <p>For although by Venery, or a Tabes, or Bleeding, or by any
        other way a man may be debilitated, he may be restored by this
        Elixir, not only to perfect health, but also to such a measure
        of strength which he never had before. Yea and a man or woman
        who is born to hereditary weakness, may be changed into a more
        then ordinary strength by the use of our Medicine: or a man who
        by labour, sickness and years, is come to the Graves mouth, even
        to drop in it, may by use hereof be restored his hair, his
        teeth, and his strength, so that he shall be of greater agility
        then in his youth, and of greater strength, and may live many
        years, provided the period of the Almighties decree be not come.
      </p>
      <p>For Minerals are of all Sublunary Bodies the most perfect, and
        the best part of them are Metals, which when they are perfect,
        defend themselves fro all fear of corruption perpetually. Now
        the Spirit of the metal when it is exalted to a millenary
        perfection, it tingeth all Metals imperfect to an incorruptible
        purity; but then this Spirit must be made a Body, according to
        the saying of <i>Hermes, Vis ejus est integra si versa fuerit
          in terram.</i> </p>
      <p>But this transcendent Tincture may be dissolved into an Oyl, or
        rather a pure Liquor, which then is not proper for Metals, but
        is only Medicinal; for it is of the nature of Light, and
        therefore it doth as readily concur with our formal vial
        principle, as one flame will enter another. </p>
      <p>Yea and beyond this, it may be exalted beyond the nature of
        man, yea and of any tangible Body, to become a most radiant
        perpetual Light, which I have seen, though not my self actually
        made. All this is done by the Divine virtue of our Water, which
        is to be prepared as is said, by Cohobation and Distillation,
        for out Water is a living Water, and not corrosive, as any do
        mis-interpret our Books. </p>
      <p>These then are the circumstantial qualities of our Water, it is
        pure, clean, and very bright, it is quick, and very fluent,
        without Humectation; it is the only profitable subject that we
        can choose for this Art, and whatever can be taken in hand in
        the World besides this, is but fallacious. </p>
      <p><i>It is a marvelous thing in kind,</i> <br>
        <i>And without it can nothing be done,</i> <br>
        <i>Therefore did Hermes call it his Wind,</i> <br>
        <i>For it up-flying from Sun and Moon,</i> <br>
        <i>And maketh our Stone to fly with it soon,</i> <br>
        <i>Reviving the dead, and giving life</i> <br>
        <i>To Sun and Moon, Husband and Wife.</i> </p>
      <p>It is of a wonderful Composition, yea so wonderful that if thou
        shouldst know it by relation only, thou couldst not believe it.
        Study therefore only to know it, for it is the very hinge on
        which turns all perfection, it is that which the Wise men never
        revealed but only in Figures and Metaphors. </p>
      <p>Some have called it their sharp Vinegar, because of its
        dissolvent quality; others have called it a Bird, a Goose, a
        Phesant, and many such names they have given it. </p>
      <p>But because it ariseth in the form of a Wind or Vapour, the
        Philosophers have called it their Vapour, their Smoak, and their
        Wind; and for this cause command, that the Porter keep diligent
        watch, that it not fly away or exhale, for it would spoil the
        Work. </p>
      <p>This Water then flyeth the more Spiritual part of it, and the
        Corporal part remaineth below in the form of an Humidity, which
        doth bubble and boil continually, and the smoak in the Head
        condenseth and returneth in drops upon the Body; and by this
        means the Body of Sol, which is most fixed, to the astonishment
        of Nature is made volatile, and sends out in the Exhalation of
        the Water its subtle fiery Soul. </p>
      <p>Thus the dead Body hath infused into it a Spirit of life, and
        begins to be endowed with a living Soul, which moves aloft with
        the Spirit, and returns with the same, till the Body be wholly
        renewed. </p>
      <p>And by this means the Body of the Sun retaining the more
        Corporeal part of the Water at the bottom, they boil together,
        and enter one another, and so both by decoction become more and
        more Corporal, and make together one Hermaphroditical Body, of
        which the more fixed parts of the <i>Sun</i>, and the grosser
        parts of the Water, are the Component principals: So that being
        thus mixed, the more Corporal parts below, and the more
        Spiritual parts in Sublimation, the Bodily part is Husband and
        Wife to it self, for all Conception is made at the bottom of the
        Vessel. </p>
      <p><i>Which if they were not by craft made quick,</i> <br>
        <i>And their fatness with Water drawn out,</i> <br>
        <i>And so the thin dissevered from the thick,</i> <br>
        <i>Thou shouldst never bring this Work about.</i> <br>
        <i>If thou wilt therefore speed without doubt,</i> <br>
        <i>Raise up the Birds out of their nest,</i> <br>
        <i>And after bring them again to rest.</i> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;These Bodies do send forth a thin subtle fume, which may
        be compared to their breath; and the returning of it, and fuming
        continually, may be likened to the breathing in and out of Air,
        for saith <i>Artephius</i>, all things live by Air: and so our
        Stone it is inspired by the Air, which Air is the fume which
        ascends continually, which partakes of both Natures as well as
        the Body below doth. Also this makes that below to boil and
        swell continually, which it would not do, did not the Earth
        retain the moisture; and the Sublimation carries with it the
        subtilest part, or Soul of the Body, which easily appears by it
        changing of colours, for whatever coloureth is of <i>Sulphur</i>,
        which is unctuous, and therefore the Sublimation appears
        pinguous: the <i>medium</i> of this Extraction is Water,
        because our Water and the <i>Sulphur</i> are Homogeneal. </p>
      <p>Wherefore in this Circulation there are two things to be
        considered, the bottom, and the top; the bottom is not only the
        Body of <i>Sol</i>, for so it would not stand liquid, and flow,
        and boil, and bubble as it doth: therefore it is certain, that
        the Body retains part of the Water, which is more thick, which
        thickness digestion and mixture hath caused; which grosser part
        of the Water is joined with the Body, but not perfectly united.
        The uppermost part is not only from the Water, nor yet the most
        whole of the Water, but a certain subtle portion of your first
        Vinegar, which hath in it the most pure part of your Gold, which
        is sublimed with it, which both together make a <i>medium</i>
        of much Firiness: So then by reason of the mixture both the
        uppermost and subsident part are reduced to a mean, which hold
        one of another; therefore our Body at this time, and in this
        Operation, is called the Body both of the <i>Sun</i> and <i>Moon</i>,
        and the Vapour contains both the Soul of the <i>Sun</i>, and
        the Spirit of the <i>Mercury</i>. Take this for your prey, for
        I have reveal’d what Philosophers upon penalty of an <i>Anathema</i>
        would never disclose. </p>
      <p>If you have well attended to what I have said, I have said
        enough, and if this do not suffice you, I know not what will.
        Remember well what I have said, if you ever expect success. </p>
      <p>To sum up all therefore in one word, for I have been so long
        that I fear I have been too prolix: Remember what you go about,
        and what you work on. You take in hand an Earthly Body, which
        you would bring to a Heavenly Tincture. This you would effect by
        <i>Mercury</i>, which is the only way or <i>medium</i> in the
        World. First then, sublime till by <i>Mercury</i> thou hast
        brought thy Body to the height of volatility, and thou salt find
        that in this dissolved Body there will be such a ferment, which
        will recongeal the Spirit. </p>
      <p><i>Water with Water accord will and ascend,</i> <br>
        <i>And Spirit with Spirit, for they be both of one kind,</i> <br>
        <i>Which when they be exalted make to descend.</i> <br>
        <i>So shalt thou unloose that which Nature erst did bind,</i> <br>
        <i>Mercury essential turning into Wind;</i> <br>
        <i>Without which natural and subtle Separation,</i> <br>
        <i>May never be compleat profitable Generation.</i> </p>
      <p>For the Body though in its <i>manifesto</i> it be <i>Sulphur</i>
        congealed, and dry, yet in its <i>occulto</i> it is <i>Mercury</i>
        liquid, and moist: Now the Water which thou mixest with it hath
        this vertue, to open its pores, and then the Water of the Body
        will as naturally agree and ascend with thy Water of Life, which
        thou didst put to it, as one Water will joyn with another. </p>
      <p>Now as <i>Sol</i> hath a hidden Spirit, so hath our <i>Mercury</i>,
        which is in it invisible; for to sight it appears as other <i>Mercury</i>,
        only a little brighter, but in effect they differ wonderfully:
        which Spirit will as naturally unite with the Soul, or Fiery
        part of the Body, as Light will mix with Light, and then the
        gross part of the Body, and of the Water, in the bottom of the
        Vessel, will be brought in absence of the Soul and Spirit to
        putrefie. So then these two Fiery Natures being Homogeneous,
        will readily mix, and will sublime together in form of a white
        Smoak or Vapour, as saith noble <i>Artephius</i>, and there
        condensing in the top of the Vessel, that is, about the Sides,
        and in the Concave of the Glass, will return again and circulate
        up and down, till it have destroyed the solidity of the Body,
        making it no Body, but subliming what is subtle, and what is
        earthy and resisting turning into Ashes, or an impalpable
        Powder, by Calcination. </p>
      <p>And after Putrefaction is compleat by Circulation, the most
        fixed part which is called the Body of Fixion, the essential and
        most permanent part of both Body and Water, will ponderously be
        lifted up and carried aloft into the Air. </p>
      <p>And without this Separation and Division; all is nothing, for
        this is the very Key of the Mastery, it is the cause of
        Generation: therefore in vain is whatever is attempted without
        this, boiling the gross, and subliming what is subtle, that in
        the troubles of the stormy Sea, which works up and down as the
        Sea in the mighty Winds, what is pre may ascend, and whatever is
        impure may remain at the bottom; and when all that is pure is
        ascended, that which is left is called the Earth that remains.
        So <i>Artpehius</i>. </p>
      <p><i>Now to help thee in at this gate,</i> <br>
        <i>This last secret I will disclose to thee,</i> <br>
        <i>Thy Water must be seven times sublimate,</i> <br>
        <i>Else shall no kindly Dissolution be,</i> <br>
        <i>Nor Putrefaction shalt thou none see;</i> <br>
        <i>Like liquid Pitch nor colours appearing,</i> <br>
        <i>For lack of heat within thy Glass working.</i> </p>
      <p>Note then that Sublimation, which otherwise is called
        Separation, Division, Ascension and Descension, is the Key of
        the Work; it is placed for the third Gate, and yet it is the
        last and the first; the last it is called by Ripley, and I to
        Eccho to his voice assure thee it is the first and last. </p>
      <p>And as the Key of all our Operations is Separation, so the Key
        to it is our true <i>Mercury</i>, truly prepared and
        proportioned as it ought to be. Now the proportion of thy Water,
        is in reference to its internal additional <i>Sulphur</i>,
        which is added by the Philosopher </p>
      <p>And as the Key of all our Operations is Separation, so the Key
        to it is our true <i>Mercury</i>, truly prepared and
        proportioned as it ought to be. Now the proportion of thy Water,
        is in reference to its internal additional <i>Sulphur</i>,
        which is added by the Philosopher; which is done by successive
        Eagles, which are made by our Philosophical <i>Arsnick</i>, the
        number of which ought to be seven. The darkness vanishing, and
        the light appearing, after many showers, before the flight of
        each Eagle, our Water being thus actuated, is by Acuation
        purged, and then it becomes powerful in dissolving the Body,
        which will be done with a fewer number of eagles, or a greater,
        but with 7 or 9 most desiredly. </p>
      <p>This actuated Water is also the Instrument which doth move the
        Gold to putrefie, which no other Agent in the World can do; for
        by this the Body is ground, softened and mollified, the pores of
        it are softened, and the <i>Sulphur</i> invisible is set at
        liberty, which causeth the Body to rot, change colours, and at
        length become black like unto melted Pitch. </p>
      <p>But if thou omit any of the number of Eagles, or fail in the
        goodness of thy <i>Arsnick</i>, or err in the preparation of
        the Water with thy <i>Arsnick</i>, either in Conjunction, or
        Purification, or Digestion, or any other errour, of which
        experience will warn thee, do not then expect that the most
        exact Regimen of heat of thy external Furnace will do the Work.
      </p>
      <p><i>Four Fires there be, which thou must understand,</i> <br>
        <i>Natural, against Nature, unnatural also,</i> <br>
        <i>And the Elemental, which doth burn the brand;</i> <br>
        <i>These four Fires use we and no moe,</i> <br>
        <i>Fire against Nature must do thy Body woe.</i> <br>
        <i>It is our Dragon as I thee tell,</i> <br>
        <i>Fiercely burning as the Fire in Hell.</i> </p>
      <p>Now to give thee a touch concerning our Fire, which he that
        knows may well be accounted a Master of our Secrets: We have
        indeed four Fires, which is one more than <i>Artpehius</i>
        numbred, which yet he intended to include. The most noble Fire
        is Natural, which is that which we seek to have multiplied, and
        that is the <i>Sulphur</i> of Gold, or rather its Fiery
        Tincture; it is that which we seek for, and we use Mercury for
        Sol his sake. </p>
      <p>Our next Fire is our Fire against Nature, and that is the Fire
        of our Water which is to be corrupted, and by this corruption
        Multiplication is made. </p>
      <p>The third Fire is unnatural, which is the mixture of these two
        Fires, while they are in their action and passion, and neither
        doth actually predominate. </p>
      <p>Now for to give you a reason of these Fires denomination, know
        that Mineral Fire is <i>Sulphur</i>, which is hot and dry, and
        it is the death of the Mineral Tree, that is, it is the cause of
        coagulating, that is, taking away the flux of the <i>Mercury</i>
        which is cold and moist; this in Gold is apparent, for it is a
        coagulated perfect Body, fixed and permanent in all trials: this
        it hath from its Fire or <i>Sulphur</i>, and this is natural. </p>
      <p>But now our Water hath an actual and active <i>Sulphur</i> in
        it, and yet quick and fluid, a Fire in Water which yet is not
        burned; this <i>Sulphur</i> is true Gold, and yet it is
        volatile; this is a Riddle, the Philosophers Mystery, and yet
        true; this is contrary to Natures ordinary operation in Mineral
        Bodies. </p>
      <p>Now Nature will always care and provide for her own Child,
        before a Stranger; Gold is her own Son, and is according to her
        own Rules: but this <i>Mercury</i> is the Son of the
        Philosopher, to whose nativity through Nature contribute her
        help, yet he is out of her ordinary road, and through the
        co-operation of Art and Nature, he is, for his qualifications an
        astonishment to Nature, hot and dry internally, and that
        actually; for it is impregnated with real <i>Sulphur</i>, and
        yet not coagulated, but in one word <i>Ignis aqua</i>, Gold
        truly called, and that most pure, yet volatile and crude, and no
        abortive; not perfect, and yet left in the way to perfection,
        and yet its virtue active, not extinguished. This subject Nature
        finding mixed with her Son, the King, even Gold, by it the
        endeavors to mend his Constitution, and to multiply his virtue;
        for though living Gold be a thing of admirable fierce, yet being
        out of the ordinary channel of Natures operations, Nature doth
        not mind its preservation, much less its propagation. </p>
      <p>These three forenamed Fires are internal, secret and invisible,
        but there is one more which we use, which is not ours properly;
        for every Sophister hath it and useth it as well as we, and that
        is Culinary Fire, which yet is so necessary that without it we
        can do nothing, nor yet without the true knowledge of its due
        proportion. So then we use no Fires of Dung, nor of the <i>Sun</i>,
        or of baths, as some Sophisters perswade themselves and others,
        for these are all the Fires which we use. </p>
      <p>With the secret <i>Sulphur</i> that is in our Water, which we
        proportion exactly in the beginning, we open our Body, for this
        Fire can do and doth that which no other Fire can do, for it
        destroys and conquers the Body, and makes it no Body but a
        Spirit. </p>
      <p>So that whatever any Sophisters may suggest, our Fire is
        Mineral, it is <i>Sulphur</i>, and that pure; it is united to
        the Water in one form, and yet hinders no its flux, nor corrupts
        its form. </p>
      <p>This is the true <i>Ignis Gehenne</i>, for it Eclipseth the
        light of the Bodies, and makes them become as black as Pitch;
        which is a symbol of Hell, and for its <i>Cimmerian</i>
        darkness is by many of the Wise men called Hell. </p>
      <p><i>Fire of Nature is the third Menstrual,</i> <br>
        <i>That Fire is natural in each thing,</i> <br>
        <i>But Fire occasionate we call unnatural,</i> <br>
        <i>As heat of Ashes and Balnes for putrefying.</i> <br>
        <i>Without these Fires thou mayst nought bring</i> <br>
        <i>To Putrefaction, for to be separate,</i> <br>
        <i>Thy Matters together proportionate.</i> </p>
      <p>Our natural Fire is, as I said, the true <i>Sulphur</i> of
        Gold, which in the hard and dry Body is imprisoned, but by the
        mediation of our Water it is let loose, by rotting the moles of
        the Body under which it was detained, and after separation of
        Elements, it appears visibly in our third Menstrual. </p>
      <p>For though Gold be a compact and dry Earthy Body, none may
        think that it became what it is without the virtue of a Seed,
        which by perfection is not extinct, but sealed up only; which
        Seed is a Fiery form of Light, which nothing in the World
        wanteth, and therefore it would be a great <i>Anomalum </i>if
        it should be only defective in Metals, the choice of all
        sublunary Bodies. </p>
      <p>Betwixt these two Fires, in the time of their action and
        passion one upon another, and from another, there is made a
        medium which is part of both, which because it is not altogether
        natural, nor wholly against nature, is called unnatural. </p>
      <p>The duration of this unnatural Fire is from the time that the
        Body begins to open, and colours to change, that is in a word,
        all the time of the rule of <i>Saturn</i> and part of the rule
        of <i>Jupiter</i>, the whole Regimen of Putrefaction, and so
        much of Ablution until the Dove begin to prevail over the Crow;
        which Putrefaction as it is the turning of an intire Wheel, so
        part of it is done in sicco, when the Body is all a
        discontinuous Calx or Ashes, and part <i>in humido</i>, which
        is called a Bath, when the subsident part is liquid and boils,
        and the superiour part vapours aloft and descends. </p>
      <p>Thus you see how many Fires we have, and how they are
        distinguished: wherein I have written what I know, and as many
        as understand me will esteem my Writings highly; for without
        boasting let me assure thee, thou hast not such another
        Directory in the whole World: I may speak it without offence,
        being unknown to thee, and thou to me. This I say not to detract
        from any Philosopher, for many were deeply seen in this Mastery,
        but almost all were envious, and the most candid would have
        judged my plainness deserving an <i>Anathema maranatha</i>. I
        have here laid you so plain demonstration as I go, that you
        cannot miss, if God direct you; and without the knowledge of the
        Fires you are far wide, whatever whimsies you have in your head;
        for you shall never see the dissolution of the Body, nor shall
        you ever make black, and by consequence you cannot divide
        Elements as you ought to do, because you proportioned not your
        Matters wisely in the beginning of the Work; for, <i>Dimidium
          facti qui bene cepit, habet</i>, he who makes a good
        beginning, hath as good as half done. </p>
      <p><i>Therefore make Fire thy Glass within,</i> <br>
        <i>Which burneth the Body much more than Fire</i> <br>
        <i>Elemental, if thou wilt win</i> <br>
        <i>Our secrets according to thy desire:</i> <br>
        <i>Then shall thy Seed both rot and spire,</i> <br>
        <i>By help of Fire occasionate,</i> <br>
        <i>That kindly after they may be separate.</i> </p>
      <p>Take then my counsel, be not so careful of the Fire of the
        Athanor, as of your Internal Fire; seek it in the house of <i>Aries</i>,
        and draw it from the depths of <i>Saturn</i>; let <i>Mercury</i>
        be the Internuncio, and your signal the Doves of <i>Diana</i>.
        By the River you shall find a Tree, in which is the Nest of 10
        Eagles; take of them 7, 9, or all, but take them very white,
        which oft plunging in the River will cause: with these you may
        overcome the Lion. </p>
      <p>The heat of their stomachs is far more powerful than any Fire
        in the World; for in it Gold will be destroyed, that thou shalt
        not know what is become of it; which yet loseth nothing of it
        self, though exposed to the greatest violence of any flame. </p>
      <p>Thus with patience thou shalt see thy desire fulfilled, and thy
        heart shall rejoice; for a wide door shall be opened by which
        thou mayst behold the Mysteries of Nature in all her Kingdoms. </p>
      <p>In 40 or 50 days thou shalt behold the highest sign of most
        perfect corruption of thy perfect Body, which of a dead lump is
        thus become Seed, in which though many cannot believe that there
        is any active virtue, yet it is now to the astonishment of
        Nature made living, and by its life it kills that by which it
        was made alive, and both being mingled make one Bath, which by
        continual decoction, moving the Earth and Water below, and
        circulating the Air and Fire above, make at last one inseparable
        quintessence, the Father of Wonders. </p>
      <p>Now to God only wise, the revealer of these hidden Mysteries,
        be praise from all his Creatures for ever. </p>
      <p><i>Of Separation the Gate must thus be won.</i> </p>
      <p>Thus I have run through this Gate of Separation, which might be
        enough, for it is all; but because the Wise men have made many
        Operations for to hide the secret, and have scattered their
        notions here and there in every Gate or Operations, sometimes
        being at the beginning, sometimes at the end, thereby to puzzle
        the unwary; I must to make this Treatise intire, run through the
        rest with what brevity and plainness can. </p>
      <p><i>I shall now sing a pleasant Elegy,</i> <br>
        <i>What did betwixt two Lovers</i> <br>
        <i>Fall out, seek the reason why,</i> <br>
        <i>This Song discovers;</i> <br>
        <i>A Wife</i> <br>
        <i>Did lose her life,</i> <br>
        <i>Because she did her Husband revive,</i> <br>
        <i>Whose death did enforce</i> <br>
        <i>The man to remorse,</i> <br>
        <i>To see her dead who gave him life.</i> </p>
      <p><i>Hw was a King, yet dead as dead could be,</i> <br>
        <i>His Sister a Queen,</i> <br>
        <i>Who when her Brother, she did breathless see,</i> <br>
        <i>The like was never seen;</i> <br>
        <i>She cryes</i> <br>
        <i>Until her eyes</i> <br>
        <i>With over-weeping were waxed dim,</i> <br>
        <i>So long till her tears</i> <br>
        <i>Reach’d up to her ears,</i> <br>
        <i>The Queen sunk, but the King did swim.</i> </p>
      <p><i>These Waters with the Fire which prevail’d</i> <br>
        <i>Did him so perplex,</i> <br>
        <i>That starting up, not knowing what him ail’d</i> <br>
        <i>He sorely did vex;</i> <br>
        <i>He though</i> <br>
        <i>That there was wrought</i> <br>
        <i>Some Treason, but full little did know</i> <br>
        <i>That it was a Queen</i> <br>
        <i>Him sav’d though unseen,</i> <br>
        <i>And dy’d her self sad white I trow.</i> </p>
      <p><i>At length her Carcase, when her Gall was broke,</i> <br>
        <i>Rose to the top,</i> <br>
        <i>From which fum’d up so venomous a smoak,</i> <br>
        <i>His breath which did stop;</i> <br>
        <i>He found,</i> <br>
        <i>Which made him sound,</i> <br>
        <i>The cause of his life his Sister did slay;</i> <br>
        <i>This made him full sad,</i> <br>
        <i>And grief made him mad,</i> <br>
        <i>Thus soon his strength fell to decay.</i> </p>
      <p><i>His House and Chamber were so charged with heat,</i> <br>
        <i>It made him to faint,</i> <br>
        <i>And fainting fell into a grievous sweat;</i> <br>
        <i>His sweat did so taint</i> <br>
        <i>The Room</i> <br>
        <i>With foul perfume,</i> <br>
        <i>Which did e’en almost suffocate:</i> <br>
        <i>So feeble he grew,</i> <br>
        <i>He could not eschew,</i> <br>
        <i>But dung’d and piss’d there where he sate.</i> <br>
        <i>At length with sorrows many he expires,</i> <br>
        <i>Full glad of the change,</i> <br>
        <i>That death at last should answer his desires;</i> <br>
        <i>But what is most strange,</i> <br>
        <i>When dead,</i> <br>
        <i>That it might be said</i> <br>
        <i>How dearly he his Sister did love,</i> <br>
        <i>Their Corps did unite,</i> <br>
        <i>That they in despight</i> <br>
        <i>Of Fire, would not asunder move.</i> </p>
      <p><i>And thus together they contumulate</i> <br>
        <i>A rotting did lye,</i> <br>
        <i>Passing thoug dismal Purgatories Gate;</i> <br>
        <i>Wherein they did fry</i> <br>
        <i>So long,</i> <br>
        <i>Until among the Saints for purity they might pass:</i> <br>
        <i>Their sins were no more</i> <br>
        <i>To be found on score,</i> <br>
        <i>They then were clear as Crystal Glass.</i> </p>
      <p><i>A spirit then of life from Heaven came,</i> <br>

      </p>
      <p><i>After the Chapter of natural Separation,</i> <br>
        <i>By which the Elements of our Stone dissevered be,</i> <br>
        <i>The Chapter here followeth of secret Conjunction,</i> <br>
        <i>Which Natures repugnant joyneth to perfect unity,</i> <br>
        <i>And so them knitteth that none from others may flee,</i> <br>
        <i>When they by the Fire shall be examinate,</i> <br>
        <i>They be together so surely conjugate.</i> </p>
      <p>Having run through the Chapter of Separation with a plain
        stile, we shall now come to the life of all, which is
        Conjunction; for we seek not a ting which may be capable of
        Separation, but which may abide in all trials, the parts being
        impossible to be separated one from another, for so our
        Tinctures ought to be, or else it will be wholly unprofitable
        for our purpose. For Separation is but the middle motion, by
        which we pass from the unary simplicity of Gold, to the
        millenary <i>plusquam</i> perfection of our Stone; before which
        can be attained, there must be a loosing of the Compages of the
        Body, that so the Spiritual Fire, or tincture may be set loose;
        which being loosed, will certainly multiply it self with that by
        which it was dissolved, with which it is necessary that it
        should Radically be mixed and united, so as that both the
        dissolvent and the dissolved may make one together. </p>
      <p>This then is the benefit of our Water, that it doth not only
        reduce, open and mollifie our Body, and cause it to send out its
        Seed, but it is actually recongealed with the fermental virtue
        of this seminal essence of Gold, that it becomes together with
        the Body, one new Body perpetually united. </p>
      <p>So that although our Water be volatile when it is first taken,
        yet notwithstanding after it hath first made the Body no Body,
        but a Spirit, in which spiritualizing the Virtue or Tincture is
        augmented; after that the Body by Congelation, makes this no
        Spirit but a Body, by which the fixity is advanced mightily, so
        that both will endure all Fire. </p>
      <p>For it is not only an apparent union that is made, but real, so
        real that the Spirit and the Body pass one into another,
        penetrating each others dimensions, the Spirit being one with
        the Body, and the Body being the Spirit, the Form swallowing up
        the Matter in unity, so that all becomes really Tincture. </p>
      <p><i>And therefore Philosophers give this definition,</i> <br>
        <i>Saying this Conjunction is nothing else</i> <br>
        <i>But of dissevered qualities a Copulation,</i> <br>
        <i>Or of principles a Coequation as others tells.</i> <br>
        <i>But some men with Mercury that Apothecaries sells,</i> <br>
        <i>Meddleth Bodies that cannot divide</i> <br>
        <i>Their Matter, and therefore they slip aside.</i> </p>
      <p>Of this Operation Philosophers make a great Mystery, and speak
        of it very hiddenly, in respect to the <i>terminus</i> of it,
        which they call <i>the hour of the Stones Nativity</i>, in
        which they say many marvels will appear, for all the colours
        that can be invented in the World will be then apparent. </p>
      <p>Some say their Conjunction is our reconciliation of Contraries,
        a making friendship between Enemies, because in that time the
        volatile is still ascending and descending upon the fixt: this
        by them ascribed to Contrariety. </p>
      <p>Others measuring all sublunary things by the rules of Symmetry
        and Ametry, do ascribe this Operation (which they for similitude
        sake compare to a Duel) to the over-prevailing of one principles
        qualities above the qualities of the other, and therefore they
        define Auriety to be the Anaticalness of the four Elements in
        mixture, each in his quality acting proportionable to the
        resistance of its contrary, <i>&amp; vice versa</i>. But this
        is but an Entanglement, in which the Chymist stumble upon School
        Academical Principles: I had rather embrace their Secret, as for
        Operation; but for Philosophy, jump with that noble <i>Bruxellian</i>,
        whose promised Treatises when the World shall enjoy, I suppose
        they will be the profoundest piece of Philosophy that ever was
        revealed to the World: which I admire not so much for his
        Experiments, of none of which I am ignorant, nor <i>Paracelsus</i>
        to boot, many, yea most of which are far harder (though sooner
        wrought) than the <i>Elixir</i>, and the <i>Alcahest</i> is a
        hundred times more difficult; but what I most honour in that
        noble Naturalist is, that he did search out the <i>Occulta
          Naturae</i>, more accurately then ever any did I the World. So
        that (setting aside the skill of this mastery, of which I cannot
        find any footsteps in what of his is extant) I am confident that
        he was without flattery Natures Privy-Counsellor, and for
        Philosophical verity might have commanded this Secret; but God
        doth not reveal to all men, yet who knows what he may live to be
        Master of in this point too. </p>
      <p>This I speak not to flatter him, who (besides what is evident
        to the whole World in his Writings) have no other character of
        him, and to him I am like to remain a perpetual Stranger; yet
        could as heartily desire his acquaintance, as any mans I know in
        the World, and if the Fates prevent not mine intentions, by mine
        or his death, I shall endeavor familiarity with him. But this by
        the way. </p>
      <p>To return whence I digressed; our final secret is first to
        unite the Spirit and Soul of our dissolving Water, that by the
        mediation of the Soul, the Spirit and Body may be conjoined, and
        then after several Sublimations and Precipitations made for that
        end, that the Body may be spiritualized, and the Spirit
        corporalized, so fix together the Soul, Body and Spirit, the
        flying and the fixt, that all the Elements (to use Philosophers
        terms) may acquiesce and rest in this Nest of Earth, in which
        all the virtue of the superiours and inferiours is contained,
        both in power and act. </p>
      <p>From what hath been said may appear, the strong passive
        delusion that hath taken many men of our Age, and formerly, who
        with the Chymist in <i>Sendivogius</i>, cannot dream of any
        other <i>Mercury</i>, then that <i>Mercury</i> which is to
        bought at Druggists, which they take and sublime variously to
        make it clean, and then with <i>Hogheland</i> mix it with Gold,
        applying all the words and saying of Philosophers to this their
        mixture: but when the time comes that they should see the signs
        specified of the Philosophers, there they fail, it may be by
        reason of something external to the Gold (which it gets in
        foliating, or the <i>Mercury</i>, which it gets in washing and
        purging, which though it be but little, yet it is enough in heat
        to give a light Tincture to the Superficies) they may with <i>Hogheland</i>,
        see a discoloured outside, which is nothing; for our Operation
        is not so trivial, that a man had need of spectacles, and a most
        clear light to discern it: but it is so apparent, that a half
        blind man would be amazed at it, for our Body, even the perfect
        Body is divided, which common <i>Mercury</i> can never do,
        though a man bless himself never so much in his mock-purgations.
      </p>
      <p>But when as such Work-men have waited their time out, and it
        may be out again, and see not blackness, then they run into
        another extreme, and share the fault of their errour (which was
        only in their Mercury, or withall in their proportion for <i>pondus</i>
        and heat of external Fire) between both principles, and then say
        with Hogheland, our <i>Mercury</i> and our Gold are not vulgar,
        but they are something (no man knows what) which the
        Philosophers have called Gold and <i>Mercury</i>; which yet are
        some strange thing which man never heard of, or some common
        thing, or some vile thing. Thus they vanish into smoak, and all
        for want of knowledge of our true <i>Mercury</i>. </p>
      <p><i>For until the Soul be separate,</i> <br>
        <i>And cleansed from its original sin</i> <br>
        <i>With the Water, and thoroughly spiritualizate,</i> <br>
        <i>The true Conjunction mayst thou never begin.</i> <br>
        <i>Therefore the Soul first from the Body twine,</i> <br>
        <i>Then of the corporal part and of the Spiritual,</i> <br>
        <i>The Soul shall cause Conjunction perpetual.</i> </p>
      <p>Remember then that thou get such a <i>Mercury</i>, which may
        destroy and conquer thy Body; mollify it, soften it, and draw
        out its Seed, and sever the Soul from it, by virtue of that
        Spirit which is in thy dissolving Water; Spirits naturally
        uniting with Spirits, as one flame will mix with another. </p>
      <p>The Soul being thus severed from the Body, it will dry and rot
        as naturally as any other thing will, that hath its Soul
        separated. And as by the Water (which extracts the Soul) it dies
        and grows putrid and black, so by the same Water it is washed
        from its filthy blackness; then the clean Soul having cleansed
        the Body, is united to it, that from that time the Body follows
        the Soul, and is moved always with it upon the Fire, flying and
        descending in the form of a Spirit, which is a wonder to behold.
      </p>
      <p>This is our Secret so much esteemed, <i>Conjunction</i>, which
        is celebrated after the looting, putrefying and purifying of our
        Body. This is the true process of our Work, according to the
        true exigency of nature; first the Soul is to be divided from
        the Body, that is, grossness may be purged by corruption and
        rotting, and the Spirit which is a form of light, and seminal,
        may, being let loose, multiply it self by the Spirit of the
        Water, and so being allied to the Body from whence it was drawn,
        and to the Water from whose Spirit it receives an increase in
        virtue and Tincture, it may unite both the Spirit and the Body
        with a perpetual bond. He who works thus, shall undoubtedly
        attain unto perfection. </p>
      <p><i>Of two Conjunctions Philosophers mention make,</i> <br>
        <i>Gross when the Body is with Mercury reincrudate;</i> <br>
        <i>But let this pas, and to the second heed take,</i> <br>
        <i>Which as, as I said, after Separation celebrate,</i> <br>
        <i>In which the parties be left with least to colligate,</i> <br>
        <i>And so promoted unto most perfect temperance,</i> <br>
        <i>That never after may be repugnance.</i> </p>
      <p>But when as the Philosophers speak of Conjunction, it is warily
        to be considered of what Conjunction they do mean, for as it is
        a term very often used, so is it very doubtfully to be taken.
        One Conjunction which they speak of is gross, which is properly
        <i>Amalgamation</i>, it is the first Operation after the
        preparation of the <i>Mercury</i>. </p>
      <p>But this is not the Conjunction here to be understood, but a
        more secret by far, in which man worketh nothing at all, but
        stands by only and beholds Natures Operation. And this work is
        done without any laying on of hands, and very quickly, when the
        matters are prepared and made fit. This work is therefore called
        a Divine work. </p>
      <p>This Conjunction is far more intimate than the gross, for this
        is an union <i>per minima</i>, or <i>intima,</i> so that the
        essence of the one, enters the essence of the other, so as to
        make it but one substance. </p>
      <p>This maketh a temper which man by no Art could make, for even
        as Water mixed with Water is inseparable, so is it now with
        these principles. Now is concord, amity and friendship made, for
        now the hot and the dry, will embrace the cold and moist, and
        now patience is made between the Water and the Fire. </p>
      <p><i>Thus causeth true Separation true Conjunction to be had,</i>
        <br>
        <i>Of Water and Air, with Earth and Fire,</i> <br>
        <i>But that each Element into other may be led,</i> <br>
        <i>And so abide for ever at thy desire,</i> <br>
        <i>Do as do Dawbers with Clay or More,</i> <br>
        <i>Temper them thick, and make them not too thin,</i> <br>
        <i>This do up-drying the rather thou shalt win.</i> </p>
      <p>Thus the Proverb is verified, <i>Amantium irae amoris
          redintegrato est</i>, for Love brought them together, Love
        parted them with a seeming discontent, and at last Love unites
        them with a perpetual tye, that they can no ore part for ever,
        without a new Resolution in this dissolving Water, after they
        are first become perfect. </p>
      <p>Now the same thing is both moist and dry, hot and cold,
        according to the qualities of the Elements, (that I may speak
        according to the usual voice of Philosophers) for now is of two
        made three, and of three made four, and of four one; the
        Quadrangle is turned into a Circle, to the amazement of Nature.
      </p>
      <p>For the essence of one Element now penetrateth the essence of
        another, that is, the essential properties are so thoroughly
        mixed, that all four now make but one partaking of all. </p>
      <p>These are those principles which God now hath conjoined, and
        therefore nothing can separate: Rejoyce now, O Son of Art, for
        thou hast the <i>Sun</i> for thy Diadem, and the <i>Moon</i>
        Crescent for thy Garland. </p>
      <p>That thou mayst the more certainly, easily and speedily attain
        to this, and that thy signs may the better and orderly appear,
        next to thy care of preparing true and purged <i>Mercury</i>,
        and pure Gold, first be sure of thy mixture, mix them like as a
        Potter mixeth his Loam. </p>
      <p>Be sure you do not over-glut your Earth with water, nor cloy
        your Water with Earth, but impast them, and then grind them
        together as diligently as a Painter would grind his Colours; for
        the more exactly thou mixest them, the better and sooner will
        they work one upon another in heat. </p>
      <p>Then set thy Glass in a Furnace made for thy Work, and give a
        convenient Fire, in which it may boyl night and day perpetually,
        without a minutes ceasing; order the Fire so that it may in 12
        or 24 hours begin to boyl, and from that hour not to cease
        boyling, subliming, ascending and descending, until such time as
        the moisture be dried up, and all remain below (at least the
        greatest part) in form of a discontinuous Calx. </p>
      <p><i>But manners there be of our Conjunction three,</i> <br>
        <i>The first is called by Philosophers diptative,</i> <br>
        <i>The which between Agent and Patient must be,</i> <br>
        <i>Male and Female, Mercury and Sulphur vive,</i> <br>
        <i>Matter and Form, thin and thick to thrive.</i> <br>
        <i>This Lesson will help thee without doubt,</i> <br>
        <i>And our Conjunction truly bring about.</i> </p>
      <p>Now to help the thoroughly in this mystery of Philosophical
        Conjunction, I shall particularize all our Conjunctions. We have
        particularly three Conjunctions, all which must be known by him
        who intends to compleat this Mastery. </p>
      <p>The first is gross, which I touched before; it is the <i>Amalgamation</i>
        of <i>Sol</i> with our <i>Mercury</i>, which because the
        mixture is made of two things, is called Conjunction diptative;
        and the Compound is now called <i>Rebis</i>, that is, two
        things, according to the verse, <i>Res Rebis est Vina confecta</i>.
      </p>
      <p>In this mixture there are two Natures, the one more active,
        which is the <i>Mercury</i>, the other more passive, which is
        Gold: where note, that the activity of the <i>Mercury</i> above
        the Gold, is because the moving virtue of <i>Sol</i> is sealed,
        that is, his <i>Sulphur</i> is imprisoned. Otherwise when
        Dissolution is made, <i>Sol</i> then is most active, and <i>Mercury</i>
        more passive; <i>Mercury</i> then is as it were the Feminine
        Sperm, which being more crude and tender, it is sooner wrought
        upon by the Fire, which Sol the masculine Sperm feels not till
        it be penetrated by the Mercury, and then it is forced to send
        forth its Seed; for the formal principle resides mostly in the
        Gold, and the material chiefly in the Water; in the one, being
        thick of constitution, the formal part is sealed; in the other,
        that little which is, (in respect of the Body) is more at
        liberty, and so by consequence sooner active. These two then
        must be mixed (<i>ad justam exigentiam naturae</i>) as is
        elsewhere hinted and prosecuted largely. To this if thou hast
        attended, thou shalt know the extent and full Latitude of this
        Conjunction; this is a manual work, and the last manual work,
        next to the putting and sealing of it in the Egg, that thou
        hast, before thou hast attained the first degree of the Mastery.
      </p>
      <p><i>The second manner is called Triptative,</i> <br>
        <i>Which is a Conjunction of things three,</i> <br>
        <i>Of Body, Soul and Spirit, that they not thrive,</i> <br>
        <i>Which Trinity thou must bring to Unity.</i> </p>
      <p>The next Conjunction that follows this in order, is when thou
        hast so administred and regulated thy Fire, that thy Spirits
        shall so ascend and circulate, until they have extracted out of
        the fixed Body its most digested virtue, or subtle Soul, which
        is Sulphureous, or of great Firiness. Then shall the Spirit and
        Soul descend; and shall unite it self with the Body; then shall
        the Air be converted into Dust, according to the process of
        noble <i>Sandivogius</i>, where they shall lye contumulate for
        six weeks without breath; and after when the Spirit of life
        shall enter into them, the Spirit and Soul shall by their mighty
        force carry aloft the Body with them, so that it shall go out
        and return with them, for now these three are made one. </p>
      <p><i>For as the Soul to the Spirit the bond must be,</i> <br>
        <i>Right so the Body the Soul to him must knit.</i> <br>
        <i>Out of thy mind let not this Lesson flit.</i> </p>
      <p>So then by the mediation of the Soul, the Spirit is made one,
        and incorporate with the Body; for the Soul being by the Spirit
        drawn from the Body, doth naturally desire to be united with it
        again, and so long as it is from it, is from home as it were in
        a Pilgrimage. The Body also naturally doth desire its Soul, and
        will as forcibly attract it as a Loadstone doth attract Iron:
        for know, that the Soul doth not ascend, but it carries with it
        a fermental Odour of the Body, by which it doth so effectually
        affect the Spirit, that it begins to think of taking a new
        impression, and becomes daily by little and little more and more
        able to suffer Fire, and by consequence draws to the nature of a
        Body: observe this. </p>
      <p><i>The third manner, and also the last of all,</i> <br>
        <i>Four Elements together which joyns to abide,</i> <br>
        <i>Tetraptative certainly Philosophers do it call,</i> <br>
        <i>And specially Guido de Montanor, whose fame goeth wide,</i> <br>
        <i>And therefore in most laudable manner this tide.</i> </p>
      <p>But yet this Conjunction doth not retain the volatility of the
        Compound, though it is so united that the parts ascend and
        descend together; the reason is, that though by the Soul the
        Spirit and Body be united, yet the Spirit sometimes doth carry
        the Body with it aloft, and the Body at times precipitates the
        Spirit, the Soul holding fast together, till at length not only
        these parts, but the Elemental qualities of them, are so
        strongly permixt, that the one doth not more in acting, then the
        other doth in resisting, by which means they are not only united
        to follow one another, but fixt to abide Fire together. </p>
      <p>This is the last and noblest Conjunction, in which all the
        mysteries of this Microcosm have their Consummation. This is by
        the Wise called their Tetraptive Conjunction, wherein the
        Quadrangle is reduced to a Circle, in the which there is neither
        beginning nor end. He who hath arrived here, may sit down at
        Banquet with the <i>Sun</i> and <i>Moon</i>. </p>
      <p>This is the so highly commended Stone of the Wise, which is
        without all fear of corruption; for here are by Nature all
        Elements Anatically mixed and united, so that it cannot suffer
        from any, for it agrees with all. </p>
      <p><i>In our Conjunction four Elements must aggregate</i> <br>
        <i>In due proportion, which first asunder were separate.</i> </p>
      <p>These our Elements are not such vain trifles, which are idly
        imagined by Sophisters; by the primary qualities, to speak after
        the common phrase, though I do not think that any thing attains
        perfection upon an account of qualities, but so it pleased the
        Antients to express themselves; only this is most certain, that
        what was before inconstant in the Fire, now is impatible
        therein, and what at first in the beginning of the Work
        discovered two distinct Natures, is now one intirely and
        inseparably. </p>
      <p><i>Therefore like as the Woman hath veins fifteen,</i> <br>
        <i>And the Man but five to act of their fecundity,</i> <br>
        <i>Required in our Conjunction first I mean,</i> <br>
        <i>So must the Man his Son have of his Water three,</i> <br>
        <i>And nine of his Wife, which three to him must be:</i> <br>
        <i>Then like with like shall joy have for to dwell.</i> <br>
        <i>More of Conjunction me needeth not to tell.</i> </p>
      <p>Our Stone is as it is called <i>Microcosmos</i>, which name
        unless to our Stone, hath been only appropriated unto Man; so
        there in the Generation of our Stone, much that may answer to
        the Generation of Man: for as Anatomists do allow the Woman
        fifteen veins conducing to the at of Venery and Procreation, and
        the Man from whom comes the Male Sperm but five; so our Stone in
        his first Composition requires three parts of the Water or
        Feminine Sperm, to one of <i>Sulphur</i> or the Male: so the
        Artist decocting, and Nature perfecting, the Mastery will be
        accomplished with the blessing of God. </p>
      <p>Remember now that the more thy Water is, the more ought to be
        thy Internal Fire t dry it up; so then when thou shalt make the
        proportion of Water to the Sun three to one, remember that thy
        number of Eagles, which is the proportion of thy <i>Mercury</i>,
        ought to be nine, or at most ten. </p>
      <p>This is the highest Acuation of the Water, which is best for
        such a proportion; as for seven Eagles, two to one is a very
        good proportion, so hast thou proportonably three Eagles to
        every one of the water which is added to the Body. Some are so
        acute as to say, that with four Eagles well cleansed, the Work
        may be performed, and then the proportion must be as three of
        the Water to two of the Body, but the decoction must needs be
        longer. I never yet tried it, knowing the forenamed proportions
        will do far better, and nine months time is a sufficient waiting
        for a Philosopher. Any shorter way is and would be acceptable,
        but more tedious are very unacceptable, since they shew nothing
        more than quicker ways, but protract the time of Putrefaction;
        for from that time the Fire of Nature is at work, and then every
        <i>pondus</i> hath the same period, provided the Fire be
        accordingly, and the Matter in the Glass not much over the
        other, for one ounce or two will be far sooner accomplished,
        than five or six ounces; therefore we advise all rather to
        content themselves with one ounce or two at most: if an ounce
        succeed, you can wish no more. </p>
      <p><i>This Chapter I will conclude right soon therefore,</i> <br>
        <i>Gross Conjunction chargin thee to make but one,</i> <br>
        <i>For seldom have Strumpets Children ybore,</i> <br>
        <i>And so shalt thou never come by our Stone,</i> <br>
        <i>Without thou let the Woman liy alone;</i> <br>
        <i>That after she once conceived by the man,</i> <br>
        <i>Her Matrix be shut up from all other than.</i> </p>
      <p>I shall soon draw to an end concerning this subject, for I trow
        that thou understandest it fully; take heed then to my Doctrine,
        mix thy Water with thy Body in a due quantity, and grind them
        together diligently, and when thou hast mixed them, shut them up
        in thy Glass carefully, and there let them stand till compleat
        perfection. </p>
      <p>And after thou hast mixed them, and set them to heat, be sure
        thou stir them not, much less open them, or add any thing to
        them, or rake ought from them, whatever any Author do seem to
        advise: For if thou do contrary to this my Doctrine, thou dost
        run an extreme hazard of losing all; for as it is with Harlots,
        who lying with many men, conceive rarely of any: so if thou joyn
        crude <i>Mercury</i> after thy first Conjunction, I will not
        say that it is impossible, but very unlikely that ever thou
        shalt attain our Mastery. And what I say of putting in fresh <i>Mercury</i>
        is to be understood of the Body also, for if thou shalt add
        fresh of that, thou wilt destroy all; for after thou setteth
        them to the Fire, thou must expect Conception, that is, that the
        <i>Mercury</i> by ascending and descending will extract part of
        the seminal virtue out of the reins of the <i>Sun</i>, which
        when she hath done, there then stands a relation between the <i>Sun</i>
        and that <i>Mercury</i>, as between Husband and Wife. Now other
        <i>Mercury</i>, or other <i>Sol</i> are not as yet so related,
        and therefore they are as a third person, which Love abhors.
        Therefore mix thy Matters so judiciously at first, that thou
        need not afterwards to wish for any new addition, and close your
        Vessel well, and decoct it carefully. </p>
      <p><i>For such as evermore add crude to crude,</i> <br>
        <i>Opening their Vessel, letting their Matters keel,</i> <br>
        <i>The Sperm conceived they nourish not, but delude</i> <br>
        <i>Themselves, and spill their Work each deal;</i> <br>
        <i>If therefore thou have list to do weel</i> <br>
        <i>Close up thy Matrix, and nourish thy Seed</i> <br>
        <i>With heat continual and temperate, if thou wilt speed.</i> </p>
      <p>They who shall do otherwise, as they discover themselves to be
        too impatient, so they certainly will destroy their Operations.
        For were it no other damage than this, that they cool their
        Seed, it is an irreparable errour; but over and besides, the
        crude Air, will they, ill they, will get in, and being as it is
        a great enemy to Generation, it destroys the germinative and
        living virtue. </p>
      <p>Then instead of getting profit, they rap certain loss; and
        instead of attaining truth, they get a delusion: for no man that
        understands himself would to it, but he that would open a womans
        Womb that is conceived, to make her bring forth sooner, or crack
        an Egg he would set under a Hen, to make it hatch more speedily.
      </p>
      <p>Therefore as I advised before, so I do now, and shall make it
        the <i>Epiphonema</i> of this discourse; mix thy Seeds, and
        elaborate them with what pains thou canst, then shut them in a
        house of Glass, that is to say, an ounce in a Glass that would
        hold about 16 ounces, or 20, or two ounces in a Glass that would
        hold two ounces or thereabouts of Water distilled; set thy Glass
        in thy Nest, about a 4th part of it in Sand, which must be
        sifted from Stones. Let the neck be fastened either with a Wyre,
        or set into a hole which may be in the Cover of thy Nest, the
        Neck about 6 inches long, a longer a little. Let thy <i>Athanor</i>
        be so that thou mayst give in it what heat thou pleaseth, and
        keep it about a day, or 16 or 12 hours at least, without
        renewing, and yet no sensible alteration in heat. </p>
      <p>In this Furnace thou shalt give thy Matter such a Fire, as may
        within the first day or two cause it to boyl, like to a Pot over
        the Fire, or as the stormy Sea swelleth in a mighty Wind; from
        the Surface of which there will exhale a Vapour which we call
        the Winds, which are in the belly or womb in the forming of our
        <i>Embrio</i>, which will condense at the top, (the Glass being
        strong) and run down in drops, and this continually night and
        day without ceasing. Thus is verified the saying of the
        Philosopher, that our Stone retaineth life, and is perfected,
        that is, divided and united, and at last fixt and congealed, by
        continual boyling ad subliming. Thus are thy Waters divided, the
        uppermost part carry aloft the Soul with them, and the lowermost
        boyl and tear and soften the Body, and make it more fit for the
        returning Spirit and Soul to work on, in their continual
        descending. </p>
      <p><i>And when thy Vessel hath stood by months five,</i> <br>
        <i>And Clouds and Eclipses passed each one,</i> <br>
        <i>The light appearing increase thy heat, then&nbsp; believe,</i>
        <br>
        <i>Until bright and shining in whiteness be thy Stone.</i> <br>
        <i>Then mayst thou open thy Glass anon,</i> <br>
        <i>And feed thy Child which is ybore,</i> <br>
        <i>With Milk and Meat aye more and more.</i> </p>
      <p>Thus shalt thou keep them for the space of 150 days, in which
        time thou shalt see a gallant Game played, the earth shall be
        overflown with Waters, the two great Lights eclipsed, the
        Heavens be clouded, the Air darkened, and all things in disorder
        and confusion; then shall the earth be turned into a <i>Limus</i>,
        and the Water by decoction continual shall be dryed up, and by
        moderate showrs and dews shall be moistned, and by continual
        washing shall be cleansed; then through the good pleasure of God
        the day-light shall spring forth, and what was before dark,
        shall now become clear, and what was black of the blackest,
        shall now be made very white. </p>
      <p>This when thou shalt see, rejoice, for our King is now coming
        from the East triumphing, he hath conquered death, and now is
        made immortal; strengthen then your Fire a little, prudently and
        with discretion continue it till such time as your Stone become
        white, and very clear and bright, sparkling like to a Sword new
        slipped, and by driness be reduced into a Powder impalpable. </p>
      <p>Now art thou come to the end of the white, and thou hast a
        Stone perfect; though this be but of small virtue, yet thou
        mayst now take it out, and use it either by Fermentation, or
        Cibation, or Imbibition, or Multiplication, and make it fit for
        projection: so that if thou hast but an ounce, thou mayst soon
        have a thousand. </p>
      <p><i>For now both moist and dry is so contemperate,</i> <br>
        <i>That of the Water Earth hath received impression,</i> <br>
        <i>Which never after that asunder may be separate,</i> <br>
        <i>And right so Water to the Earth hath given ingression,</i> <br>
        <i>That both together to dwell have made profession;</i> <br>
        <i>And Water of the Earth hath purchased a retentive,</i> <br>
        <i>They four made one never more to strive.</i> </p>
      <p>Now thou hast an intimate union between the moist and the dry,
        that one is passed into another, and of two there is a third
        made, which is a Neuter from both, and yet partakes of both; and
        these two natures that did seem so opposite, are now conspired
        together to make one substance incorruptible. </p>
      <p>For the Water which is a Spirit, hath given such an impression
        to the earth, that it which was corporal and dry, and uncapable
        of communicating Tincture, is by it become penetrative, so that
        it can in the very twinkling of an eye pass to the very Centre,
        upon an imperfect Metal on which it is project, as I have oft
        with unspeakable content observed. </p>
      <p>For it is not in our union of this <i>Sulphur</i> to its <i>Mercury</i>,
        as it is with the union of Water to Water, though we make such
        comparisons; for though we call our <i>Sulphur</i> Earth, and
        our <i>Mercury</i> Water, yet our <i>Mercury</i> will not in
        the Examen of the Fire flow away as Water will exhale from Loam,
        how exquisitely soever it be contempered with it. </p>
      <p>So then our Body which by our Art is renewed, is advanced into
        the order of Spirits, or Bodies glorified, which thought they
        have Bodies, yet they are not subject to those Laws of gross
        corporeity, which is in Bodies not regenerate: therefore our
        Stone is a System of Wonders, ponderous, fixt, and exquisitely
        compact, and yet as penetrative as hot Oyl is into soaking
        Paper. </p>
      <p>So that it is not now as it was at first beginning of
        Operation, when the one was above, the other below, compared to
        two Dragons or Birds, the one winged, the other without wings;
        but now both are capable to resist the Fire in its utmost fury.
      </p>
      <p>Now hath the Water received a fermental impression from the
        Earth or <i>Sulphur</i>, so that it is now made <i>Sulphur</i>
        with <i>Sulphur</i>, as the other is made by the Water life
        with life. </p>
      <p>This is the highest perfection which any sublunary Body can be
        brought to, by which we know that God is one, for God is
        perfection; to which when ever any creature arrives, in its kind
        rejoyceth in unity, in which is no division or alterity, but
        peace and rest without contention. </p>
      <p><i>Thus in two things all our intents do hing,</i> <br>
        <i>&nbsp;In moist and dry, which be contraries two;</i> <br>
        <i>In dry, that it the moist to fixing bring;</i> <br>
        <i>In moist, that it give Liquefaction to the Earth also.</i> </p>
      <p>Whatever then we seem to say or write to the contrary, all our
        intentional Secret consists only in two things; whatever we seem
        to advise more, is but only to intangle the unwary. </p>
      <p>Our first Secret is to know our true <i>Sulphur</i>, which
        many do allegorize to all the absurdities in the World: This is
        Gold, which is to be bought pure almost in any place. </p>
      <p>The next is to know our <i>Mercury</i>, which is not common,
        but artificial, drawn from three heads by the mediation of one
        thing, which makes the two which are dry and <i>Sulphurous</i>,
        to untie with one which is moist and <i>Mercurial</i>. These
        are different in their qualities, which difference our decoction
        so reconciles, as to make of them sweet harmony. For the <i>Sulphur</i>
        in whose increase of virtue consists our final intent, it doth
        give consistence to the Water, yet so as that it doth not part
        with it from it self, but with its Fermentative virtue it doth
        so infuse it, that of a moist Spirit tender and volatile, it
        becomes a fixt dry Fire-abiding substance. </p>
      <p>But first of all the Water doth mollifie the Body, and soak
        into it, and search out its profundity; for the <i>Sun</i>
        teyneth not, till it teyned be, for hard and dry Bodies cannot
        enter so as to transmute, till such time as themselves be first
        Radically entred, and changed from colour to colour, till they
        come to perfection; then it is fluid and penetrative, for it
        will enter to the root of the imperfect, and cause it to lose
        its imperfection, and become perfect, flowing upon it like Wax
        when it is heated by the Fire. </p>
      <p><i>Then of them thus a temperament may forth go,</i> <br>
        <i>A temperament not so thick as the Body is,</i> <br>
        <i>Neither so thin as Water withouten miss.</i> </p>
      <p>Between the dry Body and the fluid Water, we make a temperament
        which is called Impastation, for it is made like unto Paste; and
        Inceration, for it brings to the temper of Wax; but most
        properly Amalgamation, or gross Conjunction, which is a middle
        consistence between <i>Mercury</i>, and a Metal not so hard as
        the one, for it may with a Knife or ones Finger be spread to and
        fro easily; nor yet is it so currant as <i>Mercury</i>, for no
        <i>Mercury</i> will run out of it, though it be inclined one way
        or other. I need say no more, for there is hardly any vulgar
        Chymist who is not acquainted with the notion of an <i>Amalgama</i>,
        and knows what temper that is, when it will spread like Butter,
        and yet laid declining, will let nothing run from it which is
        thinner then the whole Compound; for in a thin <i>Amalgama</i>,
        the <i>Mercury</i> if it be declined will run to the declining
        side, like Hydropical <i>intercutis</i> Water. But ours is not
        so thin, and yet so soft that it is easily plyable, yet so that
        it may be rouled up in Balls, and no quick <i>Mercury</i> run
        down or sink to the bottom, He that can miss I this direction,
        would hardly find the shining Sun at Noon-day. </p>
      <p><i>Loosing and knitting be principles two</i> <br>
        <i>Of this hard Science, &amp; Poles most principal,</i> <br>
        <i>Howbeit that other principles be many moe, &amp;c</i> </p>
      <p>We have done this Chapter, and to conclude assure thee, that
        all our twelve Gates are nothing else but locking and unlocking,
        shutting and opening, dissolving and congealing, volatilizing
        and fixing, making the dry soft, and afterwards the soft dry,
        loosing and binding. Learn but this, and thou shalt be sure of
        the Keys of this Terrestrial Paradise. </p>
      <p>Yet because I would be more clearly understood, I shall pass
        through the other Gates of the Philosophers, that running
        through their multiplicity, I may as I go reduce them all to
        unity. </p>
      <p><i>Upon a day as I abroad was walking,</i> <br>
        <i>The pleasant Fields to view,</i> <br>
        <i>A voice I heard in silence softly talking</i> <br>
        <i>Of wonders passing new.</i> </p>
      <p><i>Whereat I starting stood like one amazed,</i> <br>
        <i>Not knowing what to guess;</i> <br>
        <i>But when I round about a while had gazed,</i> <br>
        <i>This terrour it grew less.</i> </p>
      <p><i>The voice I heard came from a Grove, which there</i> <br>
        <i>At my right hand did grow,</i> <br>
        <i>Which considering, silently drew near</i> <br>
        <i>The cause of it to know</i> </p>
      <p><i>Where I did see a Lady finely dressed,</i> <br>
        <i>Sit sighing by a Spring,</i> <br>
        <i>She utterd words as if with grief oppressed,</i> <br>
        <i>And oft her hands would wring.</i> </p>
      <p><i>Ah me, quoth she, how is my joy departed!</i> <br>
        <i>Oh dismal cruel death!</i> <br>
        <i>Could any think the Fiend so flinty hearted,</i> <br>
        <i>So as to bereave him breath?</i> </p>
      <p><i>I then drew near, and thought to have asswaged</i> <br>
        <i>With pleasant words her grief:</i> <br>
        <i>The more I spake, the more she was enraged,</i> <br>
        <i>Nay she disdain’d relief.</i> </p>
      <p><i>Her face was Lilly white, with Purple spots</i> <br>
        <i>Upon her cheeks and chin;</i> <br>
        <i>Her Rosie lips, her feature free from blots,</i> <br>
        <i>T’ amaze me did begin.</i> </p>
      <p><i>Beauty most rare, quoth I, what dost thou weeping?</i> <br>
        <i>What Wight most vile shall dare</i> <br>
        <i>To wrong thee, whom the Gods have in their keeping,</i> <br>
        <i>Whose face is mortals snare?</i> </p>
      <p><i>Good Sir, quoth she, forbear your words of sorrow,</i> <br>
        <i>I live, yet living dye:</i> <br>
        <i>I wish my life might end before the morrow,</i> <br>
        <i>As death I fear’s not nigh.</i> </p>
      <p><i>I had a Husband dear, of comely feature,</i> <br>
        <i>A King of great renown;</i> <br>
        <i>So lovely and so loving, that in nature</i> <br>
        <i>There’s none may put him down.</i> </p>
      <p><i>His Constitution was so strong, he scorned</i> <br>
        <i>To fly from any foe:</i> <br>
        <i>His Person was with grace so well adorned,</i> <br>
        <i>That none but him did know.</i> </p>
      <p><i>Great Phoebus he was nam’d, whose princely merit</i> <br>
        <i>‘Tis death for to recite;</i> <br>
        <i>So Rich he was, the wealth he did inherit</i> <br>
        <i>Great honour did invite.</i> </p>
      <p><i>We walking here the pleasant Woods among,</i> <br>
        <i>Found this unhappy Spring,</i> <br>
        <i>Of which to drink for thirst my Lord did long,</i> <br>
        <i>Which draught his end did bring.</i> </p>
      <p><i>For stooping down, the Water with its stream</i> <br>
        <i>His head did make so light,</i> <br>
        <i>He could not rise, but dropt into the stream</i> <br>
        <i>To everlasting Night.</i> </p>
      <p><i>He strove to swim, but to the bottom sank,</i> <br>
        <i>O dismal sight to see!</i> <br>
        <i>Then swelling with the Water which he drank</i> <br>
        <i>Himself he could not free.</i> </p>
      <p><i>But burst, and then the Spring began to boil,</i> <br>
        <i>And bubbling, colour chang’d;</i> <br>
        <i>‘Tis wonder for to see (alas the spoil!)</i> <br>
        <i>King dead, and Spring estrang’d.</i> </p>
      <p><i>So from its former state, that what then shone</i> <br>
        <i>Like unto glittering Skie,</i> <br>
        <i>Now like a stinking Puddle reaks, that none</i> <br>
        <i>Can it endure: yea I</i> </p>
      <p><i>Who in it lost a Husband dear, do loath</i> <br>
        <i>The vapours that ascend;</i> <br>
        <i>I hope one Spring will be the end of both,</i> <br>
        <i>‘Twould be a happy end.</i> </p>
      <p><i>So long she spake, until the water seem’d</i> <br>
        <i>Like ink, so black it grew;</i> <br>
        <i>And eke the savour erst so bad esteem’d</i> <br>
        <i>Did far surpass the hew.</i> </p>
      <p><i>The Air with Clouds most dark was fill’d, that never</i> <br>
        <i>Such Fogs and Mists were seen,</i> <br>
        <i>The which a Soul from the dead Corps did sever,</i> <br>
        <i>Whose colour first was green,</i> </p>
      <p><i>Then yellow, mixt with blue; the fumes ascended,</i> <br>
        <i>Which bore the Soul on high,</i> <br>
        <i>Which when the Lady saw, here tears were ended,</i> <br>
        <i>She fainted by and by.</i> </p>
      <p><i>Into the same Stream she did swooning drop,</i> <br>
        <i>And never more appear’d;</i> <br>
        <i>She lov’d her Husband so, she would not stop,</i> <br>
        <i>Like one of death afear’d,</i> </p>
      <p><i>And straightway she of vital breath depriv’d,</i> <br>
        <i>Was of a Lady fair</i> <br>
        <i>A Carcass made, thus both in love who liv’d,</i> <br>
        <i>Alike in death did share.</i> </p>
      <p><i>Their Souls disjoined from their Bodies hov’ring</i> <br>
        <i>Upon the Fountain plaid,</i> <br>
        <i>Expecting if their Carcasses recovering,</i> <br>
        <i>Might have their lives repaid.</i> </p>
      <p><i>The Sun in Solstice stood, whose heat did dry</i> <br>
        <i>The Waters more and more;</i> <br>
        <i>And eke beneath a Central heat did fry,</i> <br>
        <i>And sent up vapours store.</i> </p>
      <p><i>Which still returned, so long till they were chang’d</i> <br>
        <i>The greater part to dust;</i> <br>
        <i>The wandring Souls which long had been estrang’d,</i> <br>
        <i>Were now allur’d with lust</i> </p>
      <p><i>Of their own Bodies, in whose Atoms lay</i> <br>
        <i>A strange Magnetick force;</i> <br>
        <i>They also though long banish’d, day by day</i> <br>
        <i>Awaited the dead Coarse.</i> </p>
      <p><i>For Souls united were Bodies combin’d,</i> <br>
        <i>And both to each ally’d</i> <br>
        <i>So nearly, that no sooner they can find</i> <br>
        <i>A way, but they are ty’d</i> </p>
      <p><i>With knot inviolable, that no power,</i> <br>
        <i>How strong it may appear,</i> <br>
        <i>Can part them any more, even from the hour</i> <br>
        <i>They thus united were.</i> </p>
      <p><i>Thus two one Body have, of double Sex,</i> <br>
        <i>Which doth no sooner live,</i> <br>
        <i>But is impregnated; this doth perplex</i> <br>
        <i>Their foes, who fain would drive</i> </p>
      <p><i>This tender off-spring to despair: but God</i> <br>
        <i>Him safely ever keeps</i> <br>
        <i>From all Invasion, nor permits the rod</i> <br>
        <i>Of them to make him weep.</i> </p>
      <p><i>And tough his Garments and his Skin be foul</i> <br>
        <i>With blackness and with stink,</i> <br>
        <i>He shall be purged, for both Spirit and Soul</i> <br>
        <i>Are clean, whate’re men think.</i> </p>
      <p><i>A River springs amidst a Garden fair,</i> <br>
        <i>With Flowers many deckt,</i> <br>
        <i>Whose drops are Crystal like, these into Air</i> <br>
        <i>By Central heat are checkt.</i> </p>
      <p><i>This Air condenses like Pearl Orient,</i> <br>
        <i>Which on this Body falls,</i> <br>
        <i>Whose luster on its blackness being spent,</i> <br>
        <i>To brightness it recalls.</i> <br>
        <i>And both together make a Crystal Spring,</i> <br>
        <i>Whose Streams most strangely shine;</i> <br>
        <i>These after are condens’d, and with them bring</i> <br>
        <i>Treasures of Silver fine.</i> </p>
      <p><i>These Treasures if to rest untoucht a while</i> <br>
        <i>Upon the Fire are left,</i> <br>
        <i>The stealing Azure will the white beguile,</i> <br>
        <i>And both will be bereft</i> </p>
      <p><i>Of Being by the Vert, which long will dure;</i> <br>
        <i>The Citrine will succeed,</i> <br>
        <i>Which will abide full long, but then be sure</i> <br>
        <i>To see the sparkling red.</i> </p>
      <p><i>Then is the King who formerly was drown’d,</i> <br>
        <i>Become the whole Earth’s wonder;</i> <br>
        <i>His Wife and he are one, and both abound</i> <br>
        <i>With wealth; nor they asunder</i> </p>
      <p><i>Will ever more depart: now all their Foes</i> <br>
        <i>Must their dominion know;</i> <br>
        <i>Who will not stoop, shall surely feel their blows,</i> <br>
        <i>For all are him below.</i> </p>
      <p><i>His brethren all who formerly were held</i> <br>
        <i>As Slaves in prison fast,</i> <br>
        <i>Are now set free; their Enemies which swell’d</i> <br>
        <i>With pride, full low were cast.</i> </p>
      <p><i>Thus by bis death, the King hath now obtain’d</i> <br>
        <i>That Glory which before</i> <br>
        <i>He never had; his former state’s disdain’d</i> <br>
        <i>His Wife now weeps no more.</i> </p>
      <p><i>She’s one with him, his former Kingdom he</i> <br>
        <i>Unto his Brethren gives;</i> <br>
        <i>The worst of them dot now those Fortunes see</i> <br>
        <i>That each in plenty lives.</i> </p>
      <p><i>And what their Brother was before his death,</i> <br>
        <i>That they are now become,</i> <br>
        <i>For he their sickness cures with his breath,</i> <br>
        <i>And makes them live at home.</i> </p>
      <p><i>No more in bondage, bonds no place can find,</i> <br>
        <i>All liberty enjoy;</i> <br>
        <i>There’s nothing here can hurt, for all one mind</i> <br>
        <i>Have: all that would destroy</i> </p>
      <p><i>Is banish’d from the Kingly Palace, where</i> <br>
        <i>The streets with Gold are pav’d;</i> <br>
        <i>The Walls are Silver fine, the Gates most clear</i> <br>
        <i>Intire Gems, engrav’d</i> </p>
      <p><i>With wondrous Art; the Windows glass most pure,</i> <br>
        <i>Which falls nor knocks can break;</i> <br>
        <i>The Drink from fear of venom still is sure,</i> <br>
        <i>Whose virtue none can speak.</i> </p>
      <p><i>Whoso comes there, it at a place arriv’d</i> <br>
        <i>Where neither want, nor death,</i> <br>
        <i>Nor any grief is known; a place contriv’d</i> <br>
        <i>For Saints therein to breath.</i> </p>
      <p><i>Whom God shall chose, and to his Palace bring,</i> <br>
        <i>What need e more desire</i> <br>
        <i>Then God himself, that he may praises sing,</i> <br>
        <i>Kindled with holy fire?</i> </p>
      <p><i>But he whose hands unclean, and heart defil’d</i> <br>
        <i>These Mysteries forbear,</i> <br>
        <i>For you th’ are not; cease timely, for y’ are wild</i> <br>
        <i>T’ have neither wit nor fear.</i> </p>

      <p><br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
      </p>
      <p><i>Now we begin the Chapter of Putrefaction,</i> <br>
        <i>Without which Pole no Seed can multiply,</i> <br>
        <i>Which must be done only by continual action</i> <br>
        <i>Of heat in the Body, moist not manually;</i> <br>
        <i>For Bodies else may not be altered naturally.</i> </p>
      <p>We have already run through four Gates, the first being opened,
        the rest stand open at will; so that thou hast need only to
        enter. The course and method of Philosophers now doth lead us to
        the Gate of Putrefaction, a horrible Gate, whose entrance is
        dark with <i>Cimmerian</i> night dreadful with many windings
        and turnings. </p>
      <p>And yet it is a Gate so necessary, that unless you pass through
        it, you may never expect to reap fruit from your labour; for
        without it can be no Life nor Generation, much less desired
        Multiplication: therefore saith the Poet, </p>
      <p><i>Felices atrum quotguot habere queant.</i> </p>
      <p>The cause of this death, or corruption or rottenness, proceeds
        from the action of continual heat, not so much of the external
        Fire of the <i>Athanor</i>, as of the Compound within it self;
        in which the Fire of the Water which is against Nature, doth
        open the perfect Body by continual contrition and decoction, and
        so lets loose its <i>Sulphur</i> that was incarcerate, which is
        Fire of Nature, that so between these two in continual action
        and passion, together with the external heat continually acting,
        the whole Compound is brought to corruption, being sometimes
        roasted with external heat, which doth sublime the moisture,
        which again of its own accord returns continually, and doth
        moisten the earth so long, until by reason of the heat it have
        drunk up the moisture wholly, and then it dyes. </p>
      <p>And unless thou see this sign, of rotting of thy Compound,
        which is done in a black colour, a stinking odour, and with a
        discontinuity of parts, thy labour will still be in vain; for
        thou mayst never expect what thou desirest, to have a new form
        brought in, till the old form be corrupted and put off. </p>
      <p><i>Sith Christ doth witness, without the Grain of Wheat</i> <br>
        <i>Dye in the Ground, increase thou mayst none get.</i> <br>
        <i>And in like wise without the Matter putrefie,</i> <br>
        <i>It may in no wise truly be alterate,</i> <br>
        <i>Neither thy Elements may be divided kindly,</i> <br>
        <i>Nor the Conjunction of them perfectly celebrate:</i> <br>
        <i>That therefore thy labour be not frustrate,</i> <br>
        <i>The privity of our putrefying well understand,</i> <br>
        <i>Or every thou take this Work in hand.</i> </p>
      <p>This is so constant to Natures constant proceedings, that the
        painful Husbandman, that he may have an increased harvest,
        commits his precious Seed to the Ground, in it to rot, and to be
        corrupted, that so a new Life may spring from the old dead Body;
        nor doth he ever expect increase, so long as it remains in his
        Garner. </p>
      <p>Right so we, so long as our material principles continue in
        their own nature and form, they are but of a single value, for
        Gold and <i>Mercury</i> are two such principles, that they will
        for ever delude as many as proceed to work on them in a
        Sophistical way; for whatever the Artist may think, they will
        remain the same unto the end of the World, unless pure Sol being
        mixed with its own pure and appropriated <i>Mercury</i>, and
        set in a due heat of digestion, there arise a mutual action and
        passion between them, which without the laying on of the Artists
        hands, will tend to a new Generation. For in a convenient Fire,
        in which the Compound may perpetually and uncessantly boyl, and
        the subtle parts may ascend and circulate upon the gross without
        intermission, the most digested Virtue or Soul of the fixed
        Body, (which is his <i>basis</i> of Tincture) will be extracted
        by the Water, and this will mix with it self with the pure
        Spirit of the Water, and with this it will ascend and return,
        until a total separation be made of the pure from the impure,
        and the subtle from the gross. </p>
      <p>Then shall the Body draw down its Soul again, and by the power
        of the most High it shall be united, and with it the Spirit of
        life shall be joined also, so that all three shall become one
        with an union indissolvable; but all this pre-supposeth a
        Putrefaction, or Corruption of one form, else cannot there be an
        Introduction of another. </p>
      <p>Therefore since this mystery of Putrefaction is not more secret
        then necessary, so necessary that without it there is nothing
        can be done to purpose, that is to say, with profit; I shall be
        a little plain and full in the prosecution of this mystery: For
        in the knowledge of this consists all that is required to make a
        Philosopher. All the intentions of the Artist, must be only so
        to prepare and order things, that he may be sure of this <i>terminus</i>;
        and when he is there come, he is as sure a Master as if he had
        the Stone in his Cabinet. By the failing of this sign, the
        Operator is always to turn either backward to seek out some
        other principles, or forward, or to the right, or to the left;
        but when he is Master of this, he then can fail in nothing but
        in the Regimen of the outward heat. </p>
      <p><i>And Putrefaction may thus defined be,</i> <br>
        <i>After Philosophers definition to be of Bodies the slaying,</i>
        <br>
        <i>And in our compound a division of things three,</i> <br>
        <i>The killed Bodies into Corruption forth leading,</i> <br>
        <i>And after unto Regeneration them ableing;</i> <br>
        <i>For things being in the Earth, without doubt</i> <br>
        <i>Be engendered of Rotation of the Heaven about.</i> </p>
      <p>The definition that the Philosophers give of this Operation, is
        perpetually Allegorical, for this Gate they have named by all
        Metaphors almost in the World, especially from death, and dead
        men: therefore they allegorize the Vessel in this station, to
        Grave, or Tomb, and emblematically discover this Operation by
        the types of Skuls, dead Bones, and rotten Carcasses; according
        to which Metaphors they call Putrefaction, the death of the
        Compound. </p>
      <p>For when they saw the Body with the Water to melt in the Fire,
        to flow and to boyl, they called this <i>Magnesia</i>; when
        they saw the Water partly to ascend, and partly to descend, and
        partly to remain below, so that there was both a Sublimation in
        vapour, and a Motion of what was below; they said that it was
        the Spirit of the Water that ascended, or more Airy part; and
        the more Fiery part, which rejoyceth most to be united to, and
        hidden in Earth, remained below, for that was more capable of
        the Fire, and did better agree with it, as with its like: which
        because it did so uncessantly swell and boyl, and rage at the
        bottom, and make the Body begin to change its colour, they said
        it was Fire against Nature. Again, when they saw the ascending
        Vapour to change colour, they said it was the Soul of the Bodies
        was mixed with the Spirit, which because it was green, they said
        it was a vegetative Soul, and Fire of nature. </p>
      <p>Now when the Body below began to thicken, they said this was an
        Hermaphroditical Body, because part of the Water always remained
        below, and made the Body to boyl, and bubble, and flow; and
        therefore this they called a new Body compounded of two Bodies,
        the Sun and Moon, the Man and the Wife, which because it grew to
        a slimy consistence, they named it <i>Limus</i>, or <i>Limbus,
          Hyle</i>, and a <i>Chaos</i>, or <i>Terra Adamica</i>. </p>
      <p>When this Body began to grow very black, and to send up foul
        exhalation, yellowish, blewish, and black, they said this was
        Death and Corruption, which followed the separation of the Soul
        from the Body. </p>
      <p>Now when they see the Souls to be again united, and to remain
        bellows together, they knew that the Soul and Spirit were
        Immortal, that is, the Tincture or Vital Balsam was
        Incorruptible; and because they see them again unite, they knew
        the Soul and Spirit would renew the Bodies, and this seeming
        Corruption, was but a natural step to a glorious Regeneration;
        for if the Souls be again united to the Bodies, they will surely
        regenerate them, and renew them, and make them incorruptible;
        for if the Spirits had not returned t this union, they might
        only have expected the Exhalation of them: for Spiritual
        Tinctures or Essences, cannot be destroyed by corruption in many
        Vegetals,&nbsp; much less in the most perfect of Minerals and
        Metals. The union then of the Souls with the Bodies, argues
        evidently a hidden purity, under the apparent rottenness, which
        will after Purificaiton be exalted to transcendent Glory. </p>
      <p>Hereupon they said, that the Spirit and Soul which were above,
        were the Heavenly Quintessence, and the Body below was the
        Earth; and this Circulation of Spirits, were but as the
        Circulation of the Heavens about the Earth; and the falling
        drops, were but as the influential dew, which did cause the
        Earth to fructifie; and the blackness and darkness, were but the
        Winter Latitude, which with its Clouds and droppings do mellow
        and fertilize the Earth, to shoot forth with the more beautiful
        varieties in the Springe. </p>
      <p><i>And therefore like as I have said before,</i> <br>
        <i>Thine Elements commixt and wisely coequate,</i> <br>
        <i>Thou keep in temperate heat, eschewing evermore</i> <br>
        <i>That they by violent heat be not incinerate,</i> <br>
        <i>To powder dry unprofitably Rubificate:</i> <br>
        <i>But into powder black as the Crows Bill,</i> <br>
        <i>With heat of our bath, or else of our Dunghill.</i> </p>
      <p>For this cause they looked upon this as a secret, mysterious,
        yet very natural Operation, whereby the most solid and perfect
        Minerals, are by Nature so applied one to another, and
        cultivated, that the very Earth or Ground should be found, in
        which this noble Tree of the <i>Hesperides</i> may be planted
        and grow; the Matrix or Womb should be prepared, in which this
        noble Off-spring may again enter, and be born again. </p>
      <p>Therefore what by long Experience, and profound Meditation,
        Philosophers have found out and seen, that also they committed
        and communicated unto us; so that we also are made fellow Heirs
        of this great Treasure, and we shall as faithfully communicate
        our knowledge for thy Instruction. First then, take thy Body
        which is <i>Gold</i>, and thy Water which is <i>Mercury</i>,
        the one ready made by Nature to thy hand, the other thou must
        Prepare, for it is not to be found in the Land of the Living,
        but must be made; Nature here is at a <i>non-plus</i>, and so
        is Art, taken asunder, but both together effect it. </p>
      <p>Mix these together in due proportion, so as I have often told
        thee; then set them to the Fire to decoct, and give them a
        convenient heat, in which they may boyl, ascend and descend
        perpetually, without any intermission night or day. </p>
      <p>But especially and before all things be careful in your
        Internal heat, to wit, the proportion of your water for your <i>Sulphur</i>;
        that you must add and supply to it in the beginning of your
        Work, in its Preparation, is that which doth perform all the
        work within, without which your External heat is of no value,
        for it is of it self uneffectual. </p>
      <p>If then thou accend this heat so much as that it predominate,
        it will not then dissolve the Bodies, as thou expectest, but
        contrariwise burn the Flowers before they are extractd from the
        depths of their marrow: this thou mayst easily do, either if thy
        <i>Arsnick</i> be not made as it ought, or else the number of
        Eagles exceeded, or the proportion of thy Water to thy Body not
        agreeing to the number of Eagles, or thy Glass not well
        proportioned to thy Matter; it will easily burn, if thy Glass be
        too big, for so the moisture will so much be dispersed about the
        Concave, that it will not return before the earth below be left
        too dry. I have given Rules easily to avoid all these
        inconveniences. </p>
      <p>And on the other hand, be sure that thou do not erre in too
        little heat; let thy Water have Fire enough within it, to make a
        true division and corruption, which if either thy <i>Arsnick</i>
        have sufficient Fiery virtue, or if the union of this and thy
        Water be not well attended, but slightly performed, or the
        Purgation of thy water be not thoroughly made each Eagle, for so
        two or three eagles may not add the virtue of one, or if thy
        number of eagles be not just, or thy proportion of quantity be
        not duly observed. </p>
      <p>Therefore follow my advice, and be careful in both these
        particulars, and then let your External heat be so that your
        Compound may boyl and sublime, which for its similitude is
        called a <i>Balneum</i>, so long till the Vapours Cease, and
        are retained within; then will the Compound rot, which for its
        great likeness is called our Dunghill. </p>
      <p><i>Until the time that Nights be passed ninety,</i> <br>
        <i>In moist heat keep them for any thing,</i> <br>
        <i>Soon after by blackness thou shalt espy,</i> <br>
        <i>That they draw fast to putrefying.</i> </p>
      <p>First then, our Operations begin <i>in humido</i>, for in the
        beginning moisture it prevails, and is called the Phlegmatick
        Constitution of our <i>Embrio</i>; and this is called the Reign
        of the Woman, which (according to <i>Flammel</i>) seeks to get
        the Domination for many months, that is to say, for three month
        or thereabouts, which according to our Author is ninety days and
        nights, to whom many other Authors agree. This time may be
        longer or shorter, according to the better or worse preparation
        of the Matter, and the Regimen of the Fire. </p>
      <p>But when thou hast set thy Glass once, in the first place be
        sure that thou give a due, yet temperate heat; govern it so as
        that between the Waters above, and the Flouds beneath, the Earth
        may liquefie; then continue your decoction, and the Vessel shall
        be beclouded, and thy Compound shall with constant Circulation
        become black. </p>
      <p>This colour shall be a sign unto you that you have not run your
        course in vain; this is the first Gate, into which and through
        which you must enter; now know for certain that thy Seeds begin
        to rot and engender. In this Putrefaction there is life, for
        this Operation is nothing else but an extracting of Natures from
        their profundity or root; this is that which will make thy fixt
        Body to become a volatile Spirit, for Putrefaction doth loose
        the bands of all the Elements. </p>
      <p><i>Which after many colours, thou mayst bring</i> <br>
        <i>To perfect whiteness, by patience easily,</i> <br>
        <i>And so the Seed in his nature shall multiply.</i> </p>
      <p>So soon then as thou shalt have blackness, know for certain
        that in this blackness whiteness is really hidden, so really as
        a living Plant in its Seed. But before thou attain to this
        whiteness, thou mayst have patience and pass through many middle
        changing colours, which will be no small cheating to the
        Work-man, who must wait with a great deal of Longanimity until
        the Earth and Heaven be united. </p>
      <p>Then shall thy Elements perfectly accord, and one colour shall
        cover thy new-married Soul and Body, and that will be like to
        the most pure Lilly, or sublimed Salt, sparkling like to a
        new-slipped Sword in the Sun beams. </p>
      <p>In this whiteness is the Multiplicative virtue exalted, and
        made apparent in its first degree; by this white Soul thou mayst
        turn either <i>Mercury</i>, or <i>Saturn</i>, or <i>Jupiter</i>,
        or<i> Venus</i>, or <i>Mars</i>, into most pure refined Silver,
        in a short time, and that not Sophistically, to apparency, but
        in reality, inwardly and outwardly to abide all Essays. </p>
      <p><i>Make each the other to hales and kiss,</i> <br>
        <i>And like as Children play them up and down,</i> <br>
        <i>And when their Shirts are filled with Piss,</i> <br>
        <i>The let the Woman to wash be bown,</i> <br>
        <i>Which oft for faintness will fall in a swonn,</i> <br>
        <i>And die at last with her Children all,</i> <br>
        <i>And go to Purgatory to wash their filth Original.</i> </p>
      <p>But in thy first Operation, as is said before, first look for
        blackness, which will appear in the first Regimen by continual
        decoction, which blackness shall be an <i>Indicium</i> to you
        that your two Natures do begin now to imbrace and kiss one
        another. </p>
      <p>For so soon as they feel the Fire, they flow together within
        the Vessel, and boyl by continuance of decoction visibly, and
        the tender Nature not enduring the heat, flyeth aloft, and being
        inclosed so that it cannot get out, it congeals in drops in the
        head of the vessel, and about the sides, and again returns to
        its Body, which may well be called Childrens play, running round
        as it were in a Circular motion: This play continues so long,
        till the Water begins to leave its thicker parts, with the
        thicker parts of the Body, which in the bottom of the Vessel is
        called <i>Urina puerorum</i>; and the thinner parts of the
        Water, mixed with the thinner parts of the Body, which is
        dissolved in it, flies still and circulates until it have made a
        more full dissolution of the Body, which here by the odour of
        its <i>Sulphur</i> doth penetrate the Spirit and Soul, and
        makes them faint at last, and remain as it were breathless in
        the bottom of the Glass. </p>
      <p>Then shall the Body be destroyed, and both the Water and it rot
        into small Atoms, which will lie without motion, growing every
        day more and more black, until at length <i>Cimmerian</i>
        darkness cover the whole Sky. </p>
      <p>This is called the North Latitude of our Stone, and it is
        Winter, cold and dirty; here are the Elements brought to rest
        for a time, until a Generation be made in the bottom of the
        Glass, when though the will and power of God, a clean thing
        shall be brought out of this uncleanness and black venenosity. </p>
      <p><i>When they be there, by little and little increase</i> <br>
        <i>Their pains with heat aye more and more,</i> <br>
        <i>The Fire from them let never cease,</i> <br>
        <i>And see that thy Furnace be surely apt therefore,</i> <br>
        <i>Which wise men call an Athanor:</i> <br>
        <i>Concerning heat required most temperately,</i> <br>
        <i>By which thy Matter doth kindly putrefie.</i> </p>
      <p>Now thy Bath will begin to be a little more heated and stirred
        up, to wash this young King, which though noble, is yet
        conceived in a Stable; for at this time thou hast the <i>Sulphur</i>
        of thy dissolved Body let loose, which mixing with the <i>Sulphur</i>
        of the Water, doth acuate it exceedingly; the one being a
        natural, the other a Fire against Nature, both together make an
        unnatural Fire, burning like to the Fire of Hell, comparable to
        nothing but the <i>Alcahest</i>. </p>
      <p>Nor must thou think that this increase of Fire consists in the
        blowing of the Coal, no verily, it is a more subtle internal
        Fire that we have, and yet that also must be kept constant, and
        in due order. </p>
      <p>For this cause see that thy Furnace be trusty, else thou mayst
        and wilt fail; for though the Fire of Coals do not effect
        anything, yet it excites, and the Water though it be of a
        wonderful nature, yet it acts no further then it is stirred up,
        and intermission in this Work when once begun, will in the end
        prove fatal extinction. </p>
      <p>Therefore the Wise men have named the Furnace in which they
        work their Secrets, an Athanor, that is, Immortal, shewing that
        from the beginning to the end the Fire must not go out, for the
        extinction of it destroys the Work; and as death includes all
        sicknesses, which are steps to it, so an Immortal Furnace or <i>Athanor</i>,
        must not only preserve the Fire from going out, but also from
        exorbitancy either on one hand or other, for whatever swerves
        from the temperate mean, hinders the kind operation of the
        Matter, which is Putrefaction, by which means the Work is
        notably retarded and weakned, and by continuance of any
        extremity it will be destroyed, but with its due heat it doth
        putrefie kindly. </p>
      <p><i>Of this principle speaketh sapient Guido,</i> <br>
        <i>And saith by rotting dyeth the Compound corporal,</i> <br>
        <i>And then after Morien and others moe,</i> <br>
        <i>Up riseth again regenerate, simple and spiritual.</i> <br>
        <i>And were not heat and moisture continual,</i> <br>
        <i>Sperm in the Womb might have none abiding,</i> <br>
        <i>And so there should no fruit thereof up spring.</i> </p>
      <p>This according to the intention of all Philosophers, <i>Guido,
          Turba, Arnaldus</i>, and others, but especially noble <i>Trevisan</i>,
        whom I chiefly honor; so <i>Flammel, Artephius, Morien</i>, and
        all Philosophers testifie this much, namely, that the heat must
        be so adequated to the Compound, as that in it the Body, through
        the Pontick virtue of the Water, may have its <i>Sulphur</i>
        let loose, and so these two <i>Sulphurs</i> mixing together,
        may bring the whole to rotting or Putrefaction. </p>
      <p>By which putridness a Ferment is engendred, which as it doth
        volatilize all things naturally, so it doth quicken this gross
        dead Body, in so much that it mounts aloft upon the Fire with
        the Water, and riseth a new glorious Body mixed with the Water,
        so that both being become one together, the Spirit borrows from
        the Body permanency, and the Body from the Spirit obtaineth
        penetrativeness, so that both make one coelestial and
        terrestrial Compound, named the Regenerate Body and Stone of
        Paradise incombustible. All which is occasioned by the
        continuance and not failing of heat, both inwardly and
        outwardly, by which the moisture is circulated and depurated,
        without which the seminal virtue would be extinct, which only
        vegetates by heat and moisture. </p>
      <p>And if once the seminal virtue were kill’d, the remaining
        Compound would be no better then a dead unprofitable thing,
        which could never be recoverd; so that if either moisture or
        heat within, or convenient heat without should fail, there is
        nothing to be expected, but according to the Poet, </p>
      <p><i>Cunct a rent, quae non ulla reparaveris Arte.</i> </p>
      <p><i>Therefore at the beginning our Stone thou take,</i> <br>
        <i>And bury each in other with their Grave,</i> <br>
        <i>Then equal between them a marriage make,</i> <br>
        <i>To lig together six weeks let them have.</i> <br>
        <i>Their Seed conceived, kindly nourish and save,</i> <br>
        <i>From the ground of their Grave not rising the while,</i> <br>
        <i>Which secret point doth many one beguile.</i> </p>
      <p>This then is the process of our Work; take at first our Stone,
        that is, the true Material principles thereof, which are one in
        kind, and two in number: mix these together in a due proportion,
        then shalt thou see as follows. First, thy Feminine nature will
        so embrace thy Masculine, as to extract from him his Seed, that
        is, the most digested virtue, so shall the Body dye, and the
        water shall intomb it. </p>
      <p>The Water by Cohabitation shall contract amity and friendship
        with the Body, for it is nothing else but a Feminine Body of the
        same Stock, which when they are united and joined, this is
        called the marriage of <i>Gabritius</i> with <i>Beya</i>. </p>
      <p>Then shall the Vapours cease, and all Exhalation shall be
        withheld from ascending or descending during the space of 40
        days, or 42 at most, in which time though thou see not the
        former Circulation, rejoice, for now the Body begins to retain
        his Soul in a black colour. </p>
      <p>Now the Queen hath conceived the Kingly Seed, which must be
        nourished with gentle convenient Fire, till it wax strong, and
        becomes a puissant triumphant Champion, whom no earthly force is
        able to withstand. </p>
      <p>Thou must of necessity then let them have this prefixed time
        for their solitude and retirement, in which time the fixt and
        the volatile, the cold and the moist, the hot and the dry, do
        learn to agree each with other, being reconciled in this Head of
        the Crow, which is the conversion of natures into a
        discontinuous Calx, finer then Atoms of the Sun. </p>
      <p>This Operation as it is the Wyld and Labyrinth of all who seek
        this Art in vain, so it is the <i>Capo di Bone esperanza</i> to
        as many as attain to the perfect sight hereof; for now most of
        the difficulties are passed, which they are like to meet withal
        in this their Voyage to the <i>Oriental Indies</i>. </p>
      <p><i>This time of Conception with easie heat abide,</i> <br>
        <i>The blackness appearing shall tell thee when they die,</i> <br>
        <i>For they together like liquid Pitch that tide</i> <br>
        <i>Shall swell and bubble, settle and putrefie;</i> <br>
        <i>Shining colours therein thou shalt espy,</i> <br>
        <i>Like to the Rainbow, marvelous to sight,</i> <br>
        <i>The Water then beginneth to dry upright.</i> </p>
      <p>Thou must then be very carefull that thy over-heat do not now
        hinder their Conjunction, for now is the main fear of burning
        thy Flowers, which thou mayst easily do, and makes these Natures
        become a half Red, or Orange colour, instead of the true Crows
        Bill. </p>
      <p>Whereas if thy external heat be so gentle, as not to extinguish
        motion, thou shalt find that in this period thy Natures shall
        both of them die together, for one is not killed, nor dieth
        without the other; which death in its approach thou shalt
        discover by the appearing blackness. </p>
      <p>And when once the Crow shall begin to shew itself, know that
        thou shalt see a terrile day, for thou must expect to be in the
        heat of the shore, and in the storm of the inraged Sea, which
        now the Winds are abated, after a long and strong blowing of
        them, doth arise in waves, raging and taking on, and raising the
        filth from the very bottom, so that all becomes like to a
        troubled Glass of ink, or melting boiling Pitch. </p>
      <p>After this blackness, which shall endure for a long and tedious
        time, thou shalt see various and glorious colours to succeed,
        such as thou never hast seen; for all the colours that the mind
        of man possibly can imagine, shall then present themselves to
        view, which shall be an evident token to thee, that the moist
        and dark Dominion of the Woman doth now begin to vanish, and
        instead thereof the Man beginneth to rule, who first dryeth up
        the moisture of the Woman, with which there will vanish
        blackness, and the changeable colours, and after all shall be
        fixed in a sparkling dry white Powder, which is the Stone of
        Paradise. </p>
      <p><i>For in moist Bodies heat working temperate,</i> <br>
        <i>Engendreth blackness first of all, which is</i> <br>
        <i>Of kindly Conjunction the token assignate,</i> <br>
        <i>And of true putrefying; remember this,</i> <br>
        <i>For then perfectly to alter thou canst not miss.</i> <br>
        <i>And thus by the gate of blackness thou must come in</i> <br>
        <i>To the light of paradise in whiteness, if thou wilt win.</i>
      </p>
      <p>In the beginning therefore of our Work, through the
        Co-operation of heat both internal and external, and the
        moisture of the Matter concurring, our Body gives a blackness
        like unto Pitch, which for the most part happens in 40, or at
        the most in 50 days. </p>
      <p>This colour discovers plainly that the two Natures are united,
        and if they are united, they will certainly operate one upon
        another, and alter and change each other from thing to thing,
        and from state to state, until all come to one Nature and
        substance Regenerate, which is a new Heavenly Body. </p>
      <p>But before there can be this renovation, the Old man
        necessarily must be destroyed, that is, thy first Body must rot
        and be corrupted, and lose its form, that it may have it repaid
        with a new form, which is a thousand times more noble. So then
        our Work is not a forced and apparent, but a natural and radical
        Operation, in which our Natures are altered perfectly, in so
        much that the one and the other having fully lost what they were
        before, yet without change of any kind, they become a third
        thing, Homogeneal to both the former. </p>
      <p>Thus they who sow in tears, shall reap in joy; and he who goeth
        forth mourning, and carrying precious Seed, shall return with an
        abundance of increase, with their hands filled with sheaves, and
        their mouths with the praises of the Lord: thus the chosen or
        redeemed of the Lord shall return with Songs, and everlasting
        Joy shall be upon their heads, and sighing and sorrows shall fly
        away. </p>
      <p><i>For first the Sun in his uprising obscurate</i> <br>
        <i>Shall be, and pass the Waters of Noah’s Floud,</i> <br>
        <i>On Earth which were a hundred days continuate</i> <br>
        <i>And fifty, away ere all these Waters god,</i> <br>
        <i>Right so our Waters, as Wife men understood,</i> <br>
        <i>Shall pass, that thou with David may say,</i> <br>
        <i>Abierunt in sicco flumina; bear this away.</i> </p>
      <p>Remember then this Chymical Maxim, namely that a sad cloudy
        morning, begins a fair day, and a chearfull noontide; for our
        Work is properly to be compared to a day, in which he morning is
        dark and cloudy, so that the Sun appears not. </p>
      <p>After that, the Sky is over-clouded, and the Air cold with
        Northerly winds, and much Rain falls, which endures for its
        season; but after that, the Sun breaks out, and shines hotter
        and hotter, till all become dry, and then at Noon-day not a
        Cloud appearing, but all clear from one end of the Heaven to the
        other. </p>
      <p>But our Waters may more fitly be compared to Noah’s Floud, or
        Deluge, then to a day-showr, by reason of their continuance; for
        before our Waters shall all be overcome, and dried up by
        prevailing siccity, it will be about 5 months, in which time the
        Artist shall be held in constant horrour, according as the
        Allegory of <i>Aristeus</i> hath it; </p>
      <p><i>Sed ne poeniteat faciem fuligine pingi,</i> <br>
        <i>Adferet haec Phoebi nigra favilla jubar.</i> </p>
      <p>Wait patiently, for thou shalt see the Day-star arising with
        deliverance, and these Waters shall through the command of the
        Almighty abate; <i>Jupiter</i> then shall rule, in whose reign
        all things shall be restored: for by constant decoction, thy
        Body shall have virtue to receive Tincture, and to retain it,
        and to increase it, by which it shall be renewed, and shall by
        little and little digest all the moisture, which then shall be
        unto it as nourishment, Milk of Life, which we call Virgins
        milk. </p>
      <p>Then shalt thou have leisure to contemplate these wonders of
        the most High, which if they do not ravish and astonish thee in
        the beholding of them, it is because God hath not intended this
        Science to thee in Mercy, but in Judgment, to wit, that it
        should be unto thee a snare and trap, and a stumbling-block at
        which thou shalt stumble and fall, and never rise again.
        Remember then when once thou shalt see the renewing of these
        Natures, that with humble heart and bended knees thou praise and
        extol, and magnifie that gracious God, who hath been nigh unto
        thee, and heard thee, and directed thine Operations, enlightned
        thy Judgment; for certainly flesh and bloud never taught thee
        this, but it was the free gift of that God who giveth to whom he
        pleaseth. </p>
      <p><i>Soon after that Noah planted this Vineyard,</i> <br>
        <i>Which Royally flourished, and brought forth Grapes anon,</i>
        <br>
        <i>After which space thou shalt not be afeard.</i> </p>
      <p>Now as the Earth when the Waters of the Floud were abated, was
        as it were renewed; even so thy Earth is made new, and the
        Rain-bow is to the a sign that there shall never again happen
        such another Deluge, as thou hast now passed. Thy Earth then
        being renewed, behold how it is decked with an admirable green
        colour, which is then named the Philosophers Vineyard. </p>
      <p>This greenness, after the perfect whiteness, is to thee a token
        that thy Matter hath re-attained, through the will and power of
        the Almighty, a new vegetative life: observe then how this
        Philosophical Vine doth seem to flower, and to bring forth
        tender green Clusters; know then that thou art now preparing for
        a rich Vintage. </p>
      <p>Thy Stone hath already passed through many hazards, and yet the
        danger is not quite over, although it be not great, for thy
        former experience may bow guide thee, if rash joy do not make
        thee mad. </p>
      <p><i>For in like wise shall follow the flourishing of our Stone.</i>
      </p>
      <p>Consider now that thou art in process to a new Work, and though
        in perfect whiteness thy Stone was incombustible, yet in
        continuing it on the Fire without moving, it is now become
        tender again; therefore though it be not in so great danger of
        Fire now as heretofore, yet immoderacy now may and will
        certainly spoil all, and undo thy hopes: Govern with prudence
        therefore during the while that these colours shall come and go,
        and be not either over-hasty, nor despondent, but wait the end
        with patience. </p>
      <p><i>And soon that after thirty are gone,</i> <br>
        <i>Thou shalt have Grapes right as Ruby red,</i> <br>
        <i>Which is our Adrop, our Usifur, and our red Lead.</i> </p>
      <p>For in a short time thou shalt find, that this green will be
        overcome by the Azure, and that by the pale wan colour, which
        will a length come to a Citrine, which Citrine shall endure for
        the space of 46 days. </p>
      <p>Then shall the heavenly Fire descend, and illuminate the Earth
        with inconceivable Glory; the Crown of thy Labours shall be
        brought unto thee, when our Sol shall sit in the South, shining
        with redness incomparable. </p>
      <p>This is our <i>Tyre</i>, our <i>Basilisk</i>, our red Poppy
        of the Rock, our <i>Adrop</i>, our <i>Usifur</i>, our red
        Lead, our Lion devouring all things: This is our true Light, our
        Earth glorified; rejoice now, for our King hath passed from
        death to life, and now possesseth the Keys of both Death and
        Hell, and over him nothing now hath power. </p>
      <p><i>For like as Souls after pains transitory,</i> <br>
        <i>Be brought to Paradise where ever is joyful life;</i> <br>
        <i>So shall our Stone after his darkness in Purgatory,</i> <br>
        <i>Be purged and joined in Elements withouten strife.</i> </p>
      <p>As then it is with those who are Redeemed, their Old man is
        crucified, in which is sorrow, anguish, grief, heart-breaking,
        and many tears; after that the New man is restored, and then is
        joy, shouting, clapping of hands, singing, and the like, for the
        ransomed of the Lord shall return with Songs, and everlasting
        Joy shall be on their heads: even so it is after a sort in our
        Operation, for first of all our old Body dyeth, rots, and is as
        it were corrupted, yielding a most loathsome stink, and
        engendering squallid and filthy colours, and most venomous
        exhalations, which is at it were the Purgatory of his old Body,
        in which its corruption is overcome by a long and gentle
        decoction. </p>
      <p>And when it once is purged, and made clean and pure, then are
        the elements joined, and are of four contraries made one
        perfect, perpetual, indissolvable unity; so that fro henceforth
        there is nothing but concord and amity to be found in all our
        habitations. </p>
      <p><i>Rejoyce the whiteness and beauty of his Wife.</i> </p>
      <p>Our Man then to shew his singular love to his Wife, and to give
        an evident token that they will never fall out any more, is
        content to attain the degree of its perfection in her colour; so
        that the first stable colour of thy renovate Body, after its
        Eclipsation in blackness, is the sparkling white, which is a
        luster hardly imaginable. </p>
      <p><i>And pass from darkness of Purgatory to light</i> <br>
        <i>Of Paradise, in whiteness Elixir of great might.</i> </p>
      <p>This is a noble step, from Hell to Heaven; from the bottom of
        the Grave, to the top of Power and Glory; from obscurity in
        blackness, to resplendent whiteness; from the height of
        venenosity, to the height of Medicine. Oh Nature! How dost thou
        alter things into things, casting down the high and mighty, and
        again exalting them being base and lowly! Oh Death! How art thou
        vanquished when thy Prisoners are taken from thee, and carried
        to a state and place of Immortality! This is the Lords doing,
        and it is marvelous in our eyes. </p>
      <p><i>And that thou mayst the rather to Putrefaction,</i> <br>
        <i>Win this example, thou take, &amp;c.</i> <br>
        <i>The heart of an Oak which hath of Water continual infusion;</i>
        <br>
        <i>For though it in Water lay an hundred years and more,</i> <br>
        <i>Yet shouldest thou find it found as ever it was before.</i> </p>
      <p>O happy Gate of blackness, which art the passage to this so
        glorious a change! Study therefore, whoever applyest thy self to
        this Art, only to know this Secret; for know this, and know all,
        and contrariwise be ignorant of this, and be ignorant of all. </p>
      <p>Therefore if that possible thou mayst attain the depth of this
        Mystery, I shall endeavor to unfold it to thy capacity by
        similitudes and examples. </p>
      <p>Thou knowest that if a solid piece of Wood lie in water
        perpetually, it will tire the patience of the most patient
        expecter to see it rot, for it will abide many Generation, and
        in the end be as found as when it was first laid in, Yea some
        contend, that in our days Pine-Trees are dug up in their intire
        proportion, which have been buried ever since the Floud, being
        found in such places in which no Histories ever mentioned that
        such Trees grew, and so deep under ground as it is almost
        incredible; which certainly have layn at lest many hundred
        years, and yet the Wood a found as any other Tree of that sort,
        which hath not been cut down above a year or two: such is the
        force of constant Humefaction, to prevent the ordinary
        corruption of Timber. </p>
      <p><i>But and thou keep it sometimes wet and sometimes dry,</i> <br>
        <i>As thou mayst see in Timber,</i> <br>
        <i>And so even likewise, &amp;c.</i> <br>
        <i>Sometimes our Tree must with the Sun be brent.</i> </p>
      <p>But contrariwise, Timber which is kept wet sometimes, and dry
        sometimes, as usually the foundations of Timber Houses are, if
        not secured by the Masons Art, it would tire the Householders
        patience to see how soon such Timber will rot, and molder away,
        and become fit for nothing; which is a thing so well known, that
        the experience of every Rustick almost can teach it him. </p>
      <p>So resolve our Stone must be used, I thou intend to have it
        putrefie kindly; our Wheel for Putrefaction must go round, in a
        constant Elevation or Extraction of the Water or Humidity from
        the Body, by which Operation our Man the Sun is helped in his
        acting; and this Water must as constantly return to the Earth,
        to moisten it, by which the Woman the Moon is helped in her
        acting. </p>
      <p>And then with Water we must it keel, <br>
        That so to rotting we may being it weel. </p>
      <p>Between these two various Operations which one and the same
        Fire produceth, our Body is both heated and cooled, his sweat is
        drawn forth and returned upon him again, by the which means it
        is triturated, ground, softned, and made weak even unto death;
        and dying, it rots and putrefies, changing colours from one into
        another, until at the length it becomes black as Ink or Pitch,
        which is our Toad, our Crow, our Tomb filled with rottenness,
        our <i>Golgotha</i> or place of dead bones, our <i>Terra
          foliata</i> or Earth of Leaves. </p>
      <p><i>For now in wet, &amp;c.</i> <br>
        <i>To be shall cause it soon to putrefie.</i> <br>
        <i>And so shall thou bring to rotting thy Gold,</i> <br>
        <i>Intreat thy Bodies, &amp;c.</i> <br>
        <i>And in thy putrefying with heat be not too swift,</i> <br>
        <i>Lest in the Ashes thou seek after thy thrift.</i> </p>
      <p>Our Operation then, saith <i>Morien</i>, is noting else but
        extracting Water from the Earth, and returning it again upon the
        Earth, and returning it again upon the earth, so long and so
        often till the Earth putrefie; for by elevation of the moisture
        the Body is heated and dried, and by returning it again it is
        cooled and moistned, by the continuation of which successive
        Operation, it is brought to corrupt and rot, to lose its form,
        and for a season to remain as dead. </p>
      <p>This is the true intention and manner of our working, and there
        is no other manner of working that can be invented, that can
        give thee the effect of this our Operation; for this is the true
        way and means by which thy Body of Gold will be destroyed, and
        no other way profitable for our Art: Proceed therefore as I have
        directed thee, and swerve not either to the right hand or to the
        left. Take this Body which I have shewed thee, and joyn it with
        the Spirit which is proper to it, which the Wise men have called
        their <i>Venus</i>, or Goddess of Love, and circulate these two
        Natures one upon the other, until the one have conceived by the
        other. </p>
      <p>But beware you urge not the Spirit too much, but remember that
        he is a volatile substance, and if he be over-provoked, he will
        certainly break the Vessel, and fly, and leave thee the ruines
        of thy Glass for a recompence of thy over-speedy rashness; which
        trust me will make thee fetch a deep Philosophical sigh, and say
        when it is too late, I would I had been content to wait Natures
        time. Let the Fire then be such in which thy Spirit may be so
        stirred up, as to return to its Body in the Glass, and not so
        irritated as to break the Vessel, and return to the Ashes or
        Sand of the nest, or stick about the sides of the Cover of your
        Nest, or else fly about in the Room wherein the Artist is, and
        lodge in his Head, and so make it far more unconstant then it
        was before, by adding to his rash giddiness a Paralytical
        shaking. </p>
      <p><i>Therefore the Water out of the Earth thou draw,</i> <br>
        <i>And make the Soul therewith for to ascend,</i> <br>
        <i>Then down again into the Earth it throw,</i> <br>
        <i>That they oft-times so ascend and descend.</i> </p>
      <p>Proceed therefore not as a Fool, but as a Wise man; make the
        Water of thy Compound to arise and circulate, so long and often
        until the Soul, that is to say, the most subtle virtue of the
        Body, arise with it, circulating with the Spirit in manner of a
        fiery form, by which both the Spirit and Body are the Spirit and
        Body are enforced to change their colour and complexion: for it
        is this Soul of the dissolved Bodies, which is the subject of
        Wonders; it is the life, and therefore quickens the dead; it is
        the Vegetative Soul, and therefore it makes the dead and sealed
        Bodies, which in their own Nature are barren to fructifie
        exceedingly. </p>
      <p>Therefore if this return unto the earth for which it first took
        its flight, it will make it for to fructifie, and to increase in
        Tincture, and in the earth it self will multiply as a grain of
        Wheat doth in the ground. </p>
      <p>Be sure then that so fast as thou makest thy ascension, so fast
        also thy descension by; this is agreeable both to Nature, and
        the intent of all Philosophers, especially <i>Trevisan</i> in
        his Chymical Miracle; <i>Authors</i>, saith he, <i>differ
          especially in the documents of the Fire, but in this all
          agree, that the volatile ascend not higher then it may return</i>.
        This is the true temperament of the fire. </p>
      <p><i>From violent heat and sudden cold defend</i> <br>
        <i>Thy Glass, and make thy Fire so temperate,</i> <br>
        <i>That by the sides the Matter be not vitrificate.</i> </p>
      <p>Take diligent heed then that thou exceed not this measure,
        especially have a care that your Furnace be not apt to exceed,
        but that you may govern it at your pleasure, without uncertain
        increasing or slacking of heat, but that your Fire be equal and
        continually vaporous and boyling, for such a degree is
        altogether agreeable to the intention of Nature. </p>
      <p>Whereas if thou be too hasty, with <i>Vulcan</i> thou art
        always subject to errour; for even then when a discreet Work-man
        is past fear, I mean in the fourth Operation, in which the
        Elements are fixed and incerated, a hasty rash <i>Vulcanist</i>
        shall make his Medicines to grow hard at the first, and with a
        stronger and continuate degree of heat, to melt into a
        vitrificate substance, without any hope of future profit. </p>
      <p>Now then that Vitrification is an errour which is incident in
        the last Operation, as burning of the Flowers is in the first
        Operation; for if in Calcination the Fire be too violent,
        instead of black thou shalt have a Citrine, or half red
        unprofitable Calx: so in the fourth Operation, by too violent
        Fire thy <i>Elixir</i> will melt being vitrified, instead of a
        natural flowing or Inceration. </p>
      <p><i>And be thou wise in choosing of the Matter,</i> <br>
        <i>Meddle with no Salts, &amp;c</i> <br>
        <i>But whatsoever any Worker to thee chatter,</i> <br>
        <i>Our Sulphur and our Mercury been only in Metals,</i> <br>
        <i>Which Oyls and Waters some men them calls,</i> <br>
        <i>Fowls and Birds, &amp;c.</i> <br>
        <i>Because that Fools should never know our Stone.</i> </p>
      <p>If thou hast attended well to what hath been told thee in these
        five Gates, thou art secure; make sure of thy true Matter, which
        is no small thing to know, and though we have named it, yet we
        have done it so cunningly that if thou wilt be heedless, thou
        mayst sooner stumble at our Books, then at any thou ever didst
        read in thy life. </p>
      <p>Meddle with nothing out of kind, whether <i>Salts</i>, or <i>Sulphur</i>,
        or whatever is of the like Imposition; and whatever is Alien
        from the perfect Metals, is reprobate in our Mastery. Be not
        deceived wither with Receipt or Discourse, for we verily do not
        intend to deceive you, but if you will be deceived, be deceived.
      </p>
      <p>Our principal know that it is but one, and that is in Metals,
        even those metals which you may buy commonly, to wit, the
        perfectest of them: but before you can command it out of them,
        you must be a Master, and not a Scholar, namely as is wisely
        said in <i>Norton;</i> </p>
      <p><i>To know to destroy their whole Composition,</i> <br>
        <i>That some of their Components may help in conclusion</i>. </p>
      <p>But trust me this is not for a <i>Tyro</i>, nor for every one
        of us, unless he have the Secret from his own Studies, and not
        by Tradition from a Master or Guide. Know then that this
        fore-recited way is true, but involved with a thousand
        broileries. </p>
      <p>But our way which is an easie way, and in which no man may
        erre, our broad way, our <i>Linear</i> way, we have vowed never
        to reveal it but in Metaphors; I being moved with pity, will
        hint it to you. Take that which is not yet perfect, nor yet
        wholly imperfect, but in a way to perfection and out of it make
        what is most noble and most perfect: This you may conceive to be
        an easier Receipt, then to take that which is already perfect,
        and extract out of it what is imperfect, and then make it
        perfect, and after out of that perfection to draw a <i>plusquam</i>
        perfection: and yet this is true, and we have wrought it, And
        because it is an immense Labour for any to undertake, we
        describe that way; but this last discovery which I hinted in few
        words, is it which no man ever did so plainly lay open, nor may
        any man make it more plain, upon pain of an <i>Anathema.</i> </p>
      <p><i>For of this World our Stone is called the Cement,</i> <br>
        <i>Which moved by craft as Nature doth require,</i> <br>
        <i>In his increase shall be full opulent,</i> <br>
        <i>And multiply his kind after thy own desire:</i> <br>
        <i>Therefore if God vouchsafe thee to inspire,</i> <br>
        <i>Like unto thee in Riches shall be but few.</i> </p>
      <p>Our Stone it is the Representative of the great World, and hath
        the Virtues of that great Fabrick, comprised or collected in
        this little System; in it is the virtue Magnetical, attractive
        of its like in the whole World: it is the Coelestial Virtue,
        expounded universally in the whole Creation, but Epitomized in
        this small Map or Abridgment. </p>
      <p>This Virtue or Power is in it self barren, sluggish, dead and
        unactive, and for this cause it remaineth without fruit; but
        being loosed by Art, it doth through the co-operation of Nature,
        produce that <i>Arcanum</i> which hath not its like in the
        whole World; for it doth heal the imperfections of all Creatures
        and Metals, taking away their sickness, and restoring them to
        perfect health. </p>
      <p>The reward which his Mastery will bring to the Artist, is
        indeed inestimable; for having it, he needs want no worldly
        blessing, for wealth he need take no care, and from all
        frailties of Body he hath a most sure Antidote. </p>
      <p>Pray then to God, that he would be propitious unto your studies
        and labours, in giving thee the true knowledge of this secret
        Mystery; it is the gift of God, I have holpen thee what I can,
        but venture not to practice barely upon my words, for know that
        what I have only hinted, is far more then what I have
        discovered; and what I have declared to thy first apprehension
        most openly, hath yet its lurking Serpent under the green Grass,
        I mean some hidden thing which thou oughtest to understand,
        which thou being Cock-sure at first blush wilt neglect; but yet
        it will bite thee by the heel when thou approachest to practice,
        and make thee begin again, and it may be at last throw away all
        as a man desperate: for know that this is an Art very
        Cabalistical, and we do study expression such as we know will
        suit almost with any mans fancy, in one place or other; but be
        sure to take this Maxim from one who knows best the sence of
        what he hath written: Where we speak most plainly, there be most
        circumspect, for we do not go about to betray the Secrets of
        Nature; especially then in those places which seem to give
        Receipts so plain as you would desire, suspect either a
        Metaphor, or else be sure that something or other is supprest,
        which thou wilt hardly without Inspiration ever find of thy
        self, which in tryal will make all thy confident knowledge
        vanish; yet to a Son of Art, we have written that which never
        heretofore was by any revealed. </p>
      <p><i>Now for a close of this most secret Gate,</i> <br>
        <i>Whereat few enter, none but they who are</i> <br>
        <i>By Gods grace favour’d; its not luck ne fate</i> <br>
        <i>That in disclosing this can claim a share:</i> <br>
        <i>It is a portion which is very rare,</i> <br>
        <i>Bestowe’d on those whom the most High shall chuse,</i> <br>
        <i>To such the Truth freely I shall declare,</i> <br>
        <i>Nor ought through Envy to them shall refuse,</i> <br>
        <i>Nor with unwonted Riddles shall their hopes abuse.</i> </p>
      <p><i>Of uncouth subjects now shall be my Song,</i> <br>
        <i>My mind intends high Wonders to reveal,</i> <br>
        <i>Which have lain hidden heretofore full long,</i> <br>
        <i>Each Artist striving them how to conceal,</i> <br>
        <i>Lest wretched Caitiffs should these Treasures steal:</i> <br>
        <i>Nor Villains should their Villanies maintain</i> <br>
        <i>By this rare Art; which danger they to heal,</i> <br>
        <i>In horrid metaphors veil’d an Art most plain,</i> <br>
        <i>Lest each Fool knowing it, should it when known disdain.</i>
      </p>
      <p><i>Remember Man how he produced was,</i> <br>
        <i>How formed from a lump of abject Clay,</i> <br>
        <i>From whence Created; he each thing doth pass,</i> <br>
        <i>Which next to Angels ever saw the day:</i> <br>
        <i>For God in him infus’d so bright a Ray</i> <br>
        <i>Of his own Image, which the Body joyn’d</i> <br>
        <i>To it, ennobled so that both pourtray</i> <br>
        <i>Their maker, as though Heaven with earth combin’d</i> <br>
        <i>A little System of the Universe to find.</i> </p>
      <p><i>But yet though he of Soul and Body both</i> <br>
        <i>Was made, and of the two the nobler part doth</i> <br>
        <i>The subject nominate; yet that same Art</i> <br>
        <i>That made so rare a piece, dot from the part</i> <br>
        <i>Less noble name the whole, Adam, or Dust,</i> <br>
        <i>Wherein a Mystery was couch’d, whose heart</i> <br>
        <i>Of life the Centre, to Earth’s bowels must</i> <br>
        <i>Return, the Earth it self for man’s sake being cursed.</i> </p>
      <p><i>Right so our Stone containeth Natures two,</i> <br>
        <i>One hidden, subtle Soul, Heavens Progeny,</i> <br>
        <i>The other gross, compact, terrene also,</i> <br>
        <i>Earth’s product must to Earth by destiny;</i> <br>
        <i>Which when resolv’d is made a feculency</i> <br>
        <i>To sight, but the Coelestial part is still</i> <br>
        <i>(Though over-clouded) most pure inwardly,</i> <br>
        <i>And shall at last most Pearlie drops distill,</i> <br>
        <i>Which shall the barren Earth with fruit in plenty fill.</i> </p>
      <p><i>Thus all our Secrets from the Eath do flow,</i> <br>
        <i>‘Tis Earth which for our base at first we take,</i> <br>
        <i>Our Wate also unto Earth must go,</i> <br>
        <i>And both together must a Limus make,</i> <br>
        <i>Which we with respite by our Art must bake,</i> <br>
        <i>Ill all become a Spirit glorify’d,</i> <br>
        <i>Whose firmness wasting, time shall never shake;</i> <br>
        <i>By perfect union th’ are so surely ty’d,</i> <br>
        <i>Each Element the other three within it self doth hide.</i> </p>
      <p><i>Take then that thing which Gold we plese to call,</i> <br>
        <i>But ‘tis not Gold, yet Gold it is in truth;</i> <br>
        <i>Metalline ‘tis, yet from a Mineral</i> <br>
        <i>It flows, which Art by Nature holp renew’th,</i> <br>
        <i>And to a Fool an ugly face it sheweth;</i> <br>
        <i>Yet to a Son of Art it lovely seems,</i> <br>
        <i>‘Tis Stellar white, and tender in his youth,</i> <br>
        <i>And vile appears in many mens esteems,</i> <br>
        <i>Yea the most part of men it for a trifle deems.</i> </p>
      <p><i>From it is made a subject of great price,</i> <br>
        <i>Shew it the Goldsmith and he’l swear ‘tis Gold;</i> <br>
        <i>But look you sell it not, if you be wise,</i> <br>
        <i>The Basis ‘tis of secrets manifold,</i> <br>
        <i>This for their secret main the Sages hold:</i> <br>
        <i>The like is in Gold digged from the Mine,</i> <br>
        <i>But to procure it is scarce to be told,</i> <br>
        <i>That you may understand, though every line</i> <br>
        <i>Were plainly wrote, yet might your practice oft decline.</i>
      </p>
      <p><i>For ‘tis a Labour hardly to be borne,</i> <br>
        <i>So many tricks and turnings in it be,</i> <br>
        <i>And he that tryeth it is surely forlorne,</i> <br>
        <i>Unless a crafty Master, credit me;</i> <br>
        <i>For I have tried both, yet could not see</i> <br>
        <i>How any in this way can be secure:</i> <br>
        <i>I therefore who have vowed secrecy</i> <br>
        <i>Have writ this way, which we can scarce endure</i> <br>
        <i>For knowledge-sake to try, its ease will none allure.</i> </p>
      <p><i>Our Kingly road I also hinted have,</i> <br>
        <i>Our way in which a Fool can hardly erre,</i> <br>
        <i>Our secret way, which much mad toyl will save,</i> <br>
        <i>Which is so easie, that I may aver,</i> <br>
        <i>If thou shouldst see it, thou wouldst it prefer</i> <br>
        <i>To any earthly pleasure; yet beware</i> <br>
        <i>That you mistake not, for I do aver,</i> <br>
        <i>A mingled Doctrine these lines do declare,</i> <br>
        <i>I or both ways in this Book of mine do claim a share.</i> </p>
      <p><i>Learn to distinguish every sentence well,</i> <br>
        <i>And know to what Work it doth appertain;</i> <br>
        <i>This is great skill, which few as I can tell</i> <br>
        <i>By all their reading yet could ere attain,</i> <br>
        <i>And yet of Theory this is the main:</i> <br>
        <i>Also to know accordingly to give</i> <br>
        <i>Due heat, which in one way thou must be fain</i> <br>
        <i>T’ increase ten-fold, thou mayst me well believe,</i> <br>
        <i>For what we decoct, t’other away will drive.</i> </p>
      <p><i>Also their Operations different</i> <br>
        <i>Appear, the one thou must sublime and boyl,</i> <br>
        <i>O tedious way! In which much time is spent,</i> <br>
        <i>And many errours, which the Work will spoyl:</i> <br>
        <i>The other silently doth make no toyl,</i> <br>
        <i>Like the still voice which to Eliah came,</i> <br>
        <i>About which Work thou needest not to broyl,</i> <br>
        <i>Nor wantst thou fiery Vulcan’s parching flame,</i> <br>
        <i>A far more gentle heat begins and ends this Game.</i> </p>
      <p><i>But if thou canst each Work perform apart,</i> <br>
        <i>And knowst them afterward to reconcile,</i> <br>
        <i>Then art thou Master of a Princely Art,</i> <br>
        <i>The very success will thy hopes beguile;</i> <br>
        <i>Thou hast all Natures Works ranks in a File,</i> <br>
        <i>And all her Treasures at command dost keep,</i> <br>
        <i>On thee the Fate shall never dare but smile,</i> <br>
        <i>No Mystery is now for thee too deep,</i> <br>
        <i>Th’ art Natures Darling, whether thou dost wake or sleep.</i>
      </p>
      <p><i>Pardon my plainness, if the Art thou knowst,</i> <br>
        <i>‘Twas the fruit of my untamed desire</i> <br>
        <i>To profit many; and without a boast,</i> <br>
        <i>No man above my Candour shall aspire:</i> <br>
        <i>My zeal was kindled with Minerva’s Fire,</i> <br>
        <i>And thou who to this Art wilt now apply,</i> <br>
        <i>My Book in Natures way shall lead thee higher,</i> <br>
        <i>Then ever thou alone mayst hope to fly,</i> <br>
        <i>If only thou shalt favour’d be by Destiny.</i> </p>
      <p><i>Peruse these lines, and being read, review</i> <br>
        <i>And read again, and on them meditate,</i> <br>
        <i>Each reading shall fresh Mysteries and new</i> <br>
        <i>Discover, which are scatter’d in each Gate;</i> <br>
        <i>For they so linked are, that all relate</i> <br>
        <i>To each, and we our words have woven so,</i> <br>
        <i>That thou mayst soon erre by misleading Fate,</i> <br>
        <i>Unless for to distinguish thou do know;</i> <br>
        <i>Remember that ‘mongst Briars thick, sweet Roses grow.</i> </p>

        <br>
        <br>
      </p>
      <p><i>Congelatio, &amp;c.</i> <br>
        <i>It is of soft things in duration of colour white, &amp;c.</i>
        <br>
        <i>How to congeal he needeth not much to care for Elements:</i>
        <br>
        <i>But Congelations be made in divers wise of Spirits, &amp;c.</i>
        <br>
        <i>Of Salts dissolved, &amp;c. and the congeal’d,</i> <br>
        <i>And some dissolveth congealing manually, &amp;c.</i> <br>
        <i>But such congealing is not, &amp;c.</i> </p>
      <p>Having largely run through the first five Gates, in which is
        all the difficulty, re-supposing now tat you have passed the
        shades of the night, and are now come to the approaching of the
        Day, whose dawning is to be seen soon after the darkness of the
        Night, and is discovered by variety of gay Clouds, which run
        before the Sun in its up-rising. </p>
      <p>The first remarkable way mark that you are to meet with, is the
        whiteness of the Compound, for the Peacocks tail though with its
        gayness it refresheth and delights the beholder, and it is thy
        first Harvest, in which the moisture is vanquished, and volatile
        Natures are fixed. </p>
      <p>The Work as it is the long-wished Haven, so it is performed
        without any help of the Artist, any more then to continue a due
        degree of outward heat; for now that thou hast not so great a
        desire after this sight, but Nature hath as great an appetite to
        obtain it, for it the end of all her former Operations, fro the
        attaining whereof thou canst not hinder her, if the external
        heat be continued as it ought. </p>
      <p>Yet about this the whole company of Alchymists do mightily
        busie themselves, who have nothing more in their hopes then to
        make out great <i>Elixir</i>; do mainly labour after
        Congelation, though in their solution, in which the Key of our
        Coagulation resteth, they are as stupid as Blocks. </p>
      <p>Some dissolve Metals with Corrosives, others Salts, and
        afterwards filter them, which they think graduates them, with
        which trumpery they intend no less a Coagulate, then the true
        permanent Tincture: but alas they are deceived, for they work
        not upon the right Matter. </p>
      <p>Others although they happen to stumble in part upon the right
        Matter, yet herein they erre, that they understand our
        Operations preposterously, and interpret our meaning contrary to
        our true intent; for all that they dream of, is such Operations
        which are to be performed by hand: thus they dissolve and
        congeal, but stumble <i>in operandi modo</i>. </p>
      <p>For our Congelation is no such thing as this, but in every
        point it is contrary as this; for in our Operation Nature only
        works, who therefore doth bring forth a true, and not a
        Sophistical Operation. </p>
      <p><i>Our Congelation dreadeth not the Fire,</i> <br>
        <i>For it must ever in it stand unctuous;</i> <br>
        <i>And it is also a Tincture so bounteous,</i> <br>
        <i>Which in the Air, &amp;c.</i> <br>
        <i>Moreover congeal not, &amp;c.</i> <br>
        <i>But that like Wax it will melt anon withouten blast,</i> <br>
        <i>For such congealing accordeth not, &amp;c.</i> <br>
        <i>Which Congelation availeth us not.</i> </p>
      <p>For as in our Solution we do not make our Gold volatile as to
        shew, as Fools may do, but actually it is made fugitive, so as
        that by no Art of man it can ever be fixt again, but only by
        that Nature which made it volatile; so also our Fixation doth
        make our flying Spirits so Fire-abiding, that they by no Art of
        ma can ever be burnt away, yet it will flow like Wax. </p>
      <p>Nor is it fixed in manner of flying Spirits in Vegetables,
        which are fixed by burning into an <i>Alcali</i>, for it will
        never relent in the Air nor Water, like to a congealed Salt. </p>
      <p>Nor yet is our Congelation a formal Transmutation of a thing by
        another seminal virtue, for then it would become of a Stony,
        Flinty, or Adamantine nature; but by its own internal virtue,
        the <i>Mercury</i> is changed into <i>Sulphur</i>
        incombustible, yet so as that the <i>Mercuriality</i> retains
        some of its qualities in a very noble remarkable way, furnishing
        the Compound with a fusible unctuosity, when at the same time
        the <i>Sulphur</i> retains that flexibility with a most noble
        incombustibility. </p>
      <p>So then take this for the Touch-stone of all thy Alchymical
        endeavors, if ever thou intend any thing commendable in our Art;
        see that thy Medicine be of an easie fusion, so that when it is
        cast on a plate of Metal heated, it may enter it, and flow in it
        like Wax or melted Pitch; yea let the flux be so easie, that it
        may flow upon <i>Mercury</i>, and enter it before its flight,
        otherwise brag not of thy skill, for thou art yet in a way of
        Sophistry, out of which thou shalt never escape, without a more
        then ordinary providence of God. </p>
      <p><i>If thou therefore list to do weel,</i> <br>
        <i>Sit the Medicine shall never else flow kindly,</i> <br>
        <i>Neither congeal without thou first it putrefie,</i> <br>
        <i>First purge, then fix the Elements of our Stone,</i> <br>
        <i>Till they together congeal and flow anon.</i> </p>
      <p>That thou therefore mayst be sure of thy Work, and not repent
        thy cost and pains, as many do when it is too late, take my
        counsel, and know that thy Medicine never can nor shall flow as
        it ought, except thy Solution be Philosophical. </p>
      <p>Know then that our Solution is not an ordinary vulgar
        dissolving of Bodies, either by Corrosives, or any other way;
        but our true dissolving is nothing else then putrefying, that
        is, a destroying of the Compaction wholly with a preservation of
        the Species. This Operation be sure to make before thou dream of
        Congelation, for then thy Spirits will naturally fix and flow
        together, congealing and relenting so long until they come to a
        perfect Powder impalpable, which then hath ingress into all
        Metals, penetrating their very profundity, and altering them
        radically. </p>
      <p><i>For when the matter is made perfectly white,</i> <br>
        <i>Then, &amp;c.</i> <br>
        <i>But of such time thou mayst have long respite,</i> <br>
        <i>Ere it congeal, &amp;c.</i> <br>
        <i>And after into grains red as bloud,</i> <br>
        <i>Richer, &amp;c.</i> </p>
      <p>So then our Congelation is nothing else but the whitening of
        the Bodies, of which the Philosopher speaketh, when he saith, <i>Whiten


          thy Body, and burn thy Books, lest our hearts be broken</i>. </p>
      <p>This is the haven at which after many a nights watching, and
        days labour, thou mayst with Gods blessing hope at length to
        arrive; but in the mean season be patient, and expect the
        harvest in its season. </p>
      <p>First thou shalt have thy Body whitened, and all become a white
        living Water, which being moved on the Fire continually, will
        turn first into greater, and after that into smaller grains,
        till all at length become a Calx of an exquisite fineness, and
        transcendent brightness, which is our Lilly Candent, which in
        the end of thy Operation by continual decoction will be turned
        into a purple redness, which is our wonderful Secret. </p>
      <p><i>The Earthly grossness therefore first mortified in moisture,
          &amp;c.</i> <br>
        <i>This principle may not be denied, &amp;c.</i> <br>
        <i>Which had. Of whiteness thou mayst not miss, &amp;c.</i> <br>
        <i>And if, &amp;c.</i> </p>
      <p>The cause of all these strange alterations in one Glass, on one
        subject, with one decoction, without laying on of hands, is from
        the internal disposition of the Compound, which at the first is
        gross and earthy, therefore in decoction it becomes very black,
        it being the nature of all moist gross things, by the Fire to
        acquire such a colour. And this is according to the intention of
        all Philosophers, that although thou seekest white and red, yet
        thou must at first make black, before thou canst make white
        profitably. </p>
      <p>But when once thy Matter is become truly black, rejoice, for
        this death of the Body will be the quickning of the Spirit, and
        then both Soul and Body will unite into a perfect whiteness,
        which is our Kingly Diadem. </p>

      <p>I took one part of the Fiery Dragon, and of the Magnetical Body
        two parts, I prepared them together by a strong Fire, and in the
        first fusion there was made about eight ounces of the true <i>Arsnick</i>.

      </center>
      <p>I did take one part of the best <i>Arsnick</i>, and I made a
        marriage with two parts of the Virgin <i>Diana</i> into one
        Body; I ground it very fine, and with this I have prepared my <i>Mercury</i>,
        working them all together in heat, until that they were most
        exquisitely incorporated: then I purged it with the Salt of
        Urine, that the Faeces did separate, which I put away. </p>

      <p>The <i>Mercury</i> thus prepared, is yet infected with an
        external uncleanness, wherefore distill it three or four times
        in its proper <i>Alembick</i>, with its Steel <i>Cucurbit</i>,
        then wash it with the Salt of Urine, until that it be clear and
        bright, and in its motion leaves no tayl behind it. </p>

      <p>Take of decrepit Salt, and of the <i>Scoria</i> of <i>Mars</i>,
        of each ten ounces, of prepared <i>Mercury</i> one ounce and an
        half, grind the Salt and the <i>Scoriae</i> very fine together,
        in a Marble Mortar; then put in the mercury, and grind it with
        Vinegar, so long until no more of the <i>Mercury</i> appears:
        put it into a Glass Body, and distill it by Sand in a Glass
        Alembick, until all the <i>Mercury</i> be ascended, pure,
        clear, and splendidly bright; reiterate this three times, and
        you will have the <i>Mercury</i> excellently well prepared for
        the Magistery. </p>

      <p>Every single preparation of the <i>Mercury</i> with its <i>Arsnick</i>
        is one Eagle, the Feathers of the Eagle being purged from their
        Crow-like blackness, make it to fly the seventh flight, and it
        is prepared even until the tenth flight. </p>

        <p><b><i>6. The Secret of the Sophic Mercury</i></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>I have taken the proper quantity of the <i>Mercury</i>, and I
        mixed it with its true <i>Arsnick</i>, to wit, about four
        ounces of <i>Mercury</i>, and I made a thin commixed
        consistence; I purged it after a due manner, and I distilled it,
        and I had a pure Body of <i>Lune</i>, whence I knew that I had
        rightly prepared it: afterwards I added to its weight of <i>Arsnick</i>,
        and I increased its former weight of <i>Mercury</i>, in so much
        that the mercury might prevail to a thin flux, and so I purged
        it, to the wasting of the blackness almost to a Lunary
        whiteness: then I took half an ounce of the <i>Arsnick</i> of
        which I made a due Marriage, and there was made a temperature
        like Potters Loam, but a little thinner; I purged it again,
        after a due manner, the Purgation was laborious: I made it with
        the Salt of Urine, which I have found to be the best in this
        Work. </p>
      <center>
        <p><b><i>7. Another Purgation, but yet better.</i></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>I have found out a better way of putting it, with Vinegar and
        pure Sea-Salt, so that in the space of half a day I can prepare
        one Eagle: I made the first Eagle to fly, and <i>Diana</i> is
        left, with a little Tincture of Brass; I began the second Eagle
        by removing the superfluities, and then I made it fly, and again
        the Doves of <i>Diana</i> are left, with the Tincture of Brass;
        I conjoined the third Eagle, and I purged the superfluities, by
        removing them, even to a whiteness, then I made it fly, and
        there was left a great part of Brass, with the Doves of <i>Diana</i>;
        then I made it fly away by it self, to the whole extraction of
        all the body; then I joined the fourth Eagle, by adding more and
        more of it own humour by degrees, and there was made a very
        temperate consistence, in which there was no <i>Hydrops</i>,
        (or superfluous moisture) as there was in the three former
        Eagles. </p>

        <p><b><i>8. I have found the best way of preparing the Sophick
              Mercury, viz. such as follows.</i></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>The Amalgamated Mass, espoused or joined very intimately by a
        due Marriage, I put into a Crucible, and into a Furnace of Sand
        for half an hour, but so that it might not sublime; then I take
        it out, and strongly grind it; then I put it again in a
        Crucible, and in the Furnace, and after a quarter of an hour or
        thereabouts. I grind it again, and I make the Mortar hot, by
        this means the Amalgama begins to be clean, and to cast forth a
        great deal of Powder: then I put it in the Crucible again, and
        to the Fire as before, for a convenient time, so that it be not
        sublimed, otherwise the greater the Fire is, the better it is;
        so continually grinding it, till almost all the Powder doth
        wholly disappear, then I wash it, and the Faeces are easily cast
        out, and the <i>Amalgama</i> becomes intire without any
        Heterogeneity; then I wash it with Salt, and again do heat and
        grind it: this I repeat to the full cleansing it from all manner
        of Faeces. </p>

        <p><b><i>9. A Threefold Tryal of the Goodness of the Prepared
              Mercury</i></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>Take thy <i>Mercury</i> prepared with its <i>Arsnick</i> of
        seven, eight, nine or ten eagles, put it into a Phial, and thou
        shalt lute it with the <i>Lutum Sapientiae</i>: place it in a
        Furnace of Sand, and let it stand in an heat of Sublimation, so
        that it may ascend and descend in the Glass, until it be
        coagulated a little thicker than Butter: continue it unto a
        perfect Coagulation, until it be as white as Silver. </p>
      <center>
        <p><b><i>10. Another tryal.</i></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>If by shaking it in a Glass with the Salt of Urine, it be
        turned into an impalpable Powder of its own accord, so that it
        doth not appear as <i>Mercury</i>, and of its own accord in an
        hot and dry place it coagulates again into a thin <i>Mercury</i>,
        it is enough; but yet better if being agitated in
        Fountain-water, it runs into small heads or particles, for if
        the grain be in the Body, it will not be thus converted and
        separated into small minute parts. </p>

        &amp;c. And in such a Fire the Body will die, and the Spirit
        will be renewed, and at length the Soul will be glorified and
        united with a new immortal and incorruptible Body: Thus is made
        a new Heaven. </p>

      <p><i>Our Work is made of Three Principles.</i> </p>
      <p><i>Where the Red Man and the White Woman are made one, &amp;c.</i>
        Thence it is evident, that our Operations are made of Three
        Principles, yet of one Essence; the <i>Red Man</i>, the <i>White


          Wife</i>, and the <i>Spirit of Life</i>: By the latter, the
        two former are Espoused or made One. This is that which <i>Trevisan</i>
        calls his One Root, and Two Mercurial Substances, crude at their
        taking, and extracted out of their <i>Minera</i>’s: This our
        Author else-where calls his <i>Trinity</i> and <i>Unity</i>;
        the<i> Trinity</i> respecting the Substances as they are
        severall; the <i>Unity</i> respecting their Essence, which is
        intirely Homogenial; Therefore it is added, that they live in
        love and rest without repugnancy, which could not be were they
        not Essentially and Radically the same; For likeness of Nature
        is the Cause of Love, and Oneness of Essence the true ground of
        Union; among different Substances can only be expected
        Confusion, if not Destruction. </p>

      </p>
      <p><i>Earth and Water equally proportion’d, that is best</i>. Here
        it is evident, that these Three Substances make up but Two
        Natures of Earth and Water: The Man and Wife are both Bodies or
        Earths; the one fixed and ripe; the other Volatile and unripe,
        and b Mixture make a brittle black Hermaphroditical Body or
        Earth called the <i>Philosophers Lead</i>, as <i>Ripley</i> in
        his <i>Preface</i> expresseth it. The <i>White Woman</i>, or
        Female, is otherwise called the <i>Moon</i> by all
        Philosophers; and by this Author in his Doctrine of Proportions;
        One of the <i>Sun</i>, and Two of the <i>Moon</i>, till
        altogether like Pap be done. </p>

      <p><i>Then make the Mercury Four to the Sun, Two to the Moon,
          &amp;c. as it should be in Figure of the Trinity.</i> And so
        we come to take notice of the Doctrine of Proportion between the
        Earth and water, equal that is best; the same saith our Author
        in his Chapter of <i>Calcination. This is the surest and best
          proportion</i>, speaking of equal <i>Pondus</i> of <i>Earth</i>
        and <i>Water</i>; and gives the Reason, because Solution will
        be sooner made, <i>viz</i>. </p>
      <p><i>The more thy Earth, the less thy Water be, The sooner and
          better Solution shalt thou see.</i> </p>
      <p>And here he affirms the same of <i>Calcination</i>, which goes
        before<i> Solution</i>. Yet Three of the Water to One of the
        Earth, will do well, lest the Tincture should not have room to
        be sufficiently dilated in the Water, and the Body opened by it;
        and this is the <i>Pondus</i> of <i>Roger Bacon</i>, which
        requires a longer time before the quick be kil’d; and by
        consequence, the reviving of the dead must be longer in doings;
        For <i>Calcination</i> is nothing else, but a killing the moist
        with the dry; till which be done, there is no reviving of the
        dry by the moist, but they have one and the same Operation and
        Period of time; for one dies not, but the other revives: nor
        doth the <i>Dragon</i> die, but with its Sister. </p>

      <p><i>The White Wife in the first Conjunction is to be Three to
          One of the Red Man.</i> </p>
      <p><i>Three of the Wise, and one of the man thou take, &amp;c</i>.
        From the <i>Pondus</i> between the <i>Earth</i> and <i>Water</i>,
        come we to view the Proportion between the <i>Man</i> and his <i>Wife</i>;
        here the <i>Pondus</i> is laid down Three to One, and so there
        are Four parts of <i>Earth</i> to Four of<i> Water</i>, or
        more, until Twelve; that is, Three of <i>Water </i>to One of
        the <i>Earth</i>. This also is clear from the Chapter of <i>Conjunction</i>,
        where the <i>Woman</i> is allow’d 15 Veins to 5 of the <i>Man</i>,
        as to the Act of their Foecundity, which is interpreted of the
        first Conjunction by himself, that the <i>Man</i> must have but
        3 of <i>Water</i>, and his <i>Wife</i> 9, which is 12 of <i>Water</i>
        to 4 of the <i>Earth</i>; by which it is evident, that the <i>Woman</i>
        is to exceed her <i>Husband</i> in a three-fold Proportion. </p>
      <p><i>Or Two to one after Reymund: Or Four to one according to
          Alanus; but Three to One is best.</i> </p>
      <p>However, in <i>Reymund’s Doctrine of Proportions</i> cited by
        our Author in his <i>Gate of Calcination</i>, One of the <i>Sun</i>
        is joyn’d with Two of the <i>Moon</i>, which make Three of the
        Body; and to these are added Four of <i>Mercury</i>, which is
        One more of the Spiritual than of the Corporal part; and this
        the Author compares to <i>Trinity</i> and <i>Unity</i>, both
        are good, Yea, and <i>Alanus</i> prescribes Four parts to One,
        which may be done, but Three to One is best and equal <i>Pondus</i>
        of <i>Spirit</i> and <i>Life</i>, for compleating of the
        marriage between this Royal Pair, the <i>Sun</i> the <i>Husband</i>,
        and the <i>Moon</i> the Wife; Of this speaks this Author in his
        <i>Gate of Solution</i>; One in Gender they be, but in Number
        not so; The Father is the <i>Sun</i>, and the <i>Moon</i> the
        Mother, the Mover is <i>Mercury</i>. </p>
      <p>This Compound according to its various Considerations, hath
        many Relations, and as many Denominations; <i>Sun</i> and <i>Moon,


          Man</i> and <i>Wife, Body, Soul</i> and <i>Spirit, Earth</i>

      </p>
      <p>Quest. <i>What is the Red Man? What his White Wife? What is
          the Spirit of Life?</i> </p>
      <p>It may be questioned here what this <i>Red Man</i> is? What
        his <i>White Wife</i>? And what the <i>Spirit of Life</i>? For
        that is the only knot in understanding the Writings of
        Philosophers, whose various Expressions, and seeming
        Contradictions herein, do obscure the Art wonderfully: Yet
        however they seem to differ in their Writings, they mean all one
        thing, if well or rightly understood. </p>
      <p>Answer 1st. <i>What the Red Man is?</i> </p>
      <p>The <i>Red Man</i> betokens the perfect Body of the <i>Sun</i>,
        or his Shadow the <i>Moon</i>; For <i>Lune</i> the Body, which
        is one of the Seven, is a Male, and a perfect Body, and fixed,
        only wants a little Digestion; and therefore the Red is hid
        under its visible White, as White is hid under the visible Red
        of <i>Sol</i>: Therefore our Author in his Work of <i>Albification</i>,
        saith, that the Sun appeareth White and Bright: And <i>Trevisan</i>
        saith, our King, who is cloathed in Garments of pure Gold, after
        he is once in the Bath, appears no more till after <i>one
          hundred and thirty days</i>; and then he appears White, and
        wonderfully bright and sining. And an old Philosopher saith, <i>Honour


          our King at his return from the east in Glory and admirable
          bright whiteness</i>. Therefore saith <i>Artefius, Our Water
          is of kin to the perfect Bodies, to the Sun, and to the moon;
          but more to the Sun then to the Moon</i>; (Note this well.)
        And in all his Books he joyns the Sun and Moon the perfect
        Bodies Gold and Silver for the work. So doth <i>Ripley</i>, and
        so all Philosophers, by which it is evident, that either of the
        perfect Metals or Luminaries with our <i>Aqua Vitae</i>, will
        compleat the work; as <i>Arnold</i> expressly saith in his <i>Questions



          &amp; Answers</i> to <i>Boniface</i>; and <i>Jodocus
          Greverus</i> in his Treatise, confirms the same in these
        words; <i>If so be</i> (saith he) <i>thou be so poor that thou
          canst not take Gold, then take so much Silver; yet Gold is the
          better, as being nearer of kin to our Water and Mercury.</i> </p>
      <p>Answer 2. <i>What is the White Wife?</i> </p>
      <p><i>Secondly</i>, The <i>White Wife</i>, otherwise called the <i>Moon</i>,
        is a Female; it is a Coagulated <i>Mercury</i>, but not fixt: A
        spiritual Body, flexible in nature of a Body, yet Volatile, in
        nature of a Spirit; it is called therefore <i>Mercury of the
          Philosophers</i>; Our <i>Green Lyon</i>; Our <i>immature or
          unripe Gold</i>: It is <i>Pontanus’s Fire, Artephius’s middle
          substance</i>, clear like pure Silver, which ought to receive
        the Tinctures of the Sun and moon, his <i>sharp Vinegar</i>,
        his <i>Antimonial-Saturnine-Mercurial</i> Argent Vive, without
        which <i>Laton</i> cannot be whitened; of which an old
        Philosopher saith, whiten the red Laton, by a white, tepid, and
        suffocated Water; of which testimony <i>Trevisanus</i> affirms,
        that nothing could be said better or clearer. This is that which
        is intimated in the Vision of <i>Arislaus</i>, who found a
        People that were Married, yet had no Children, because they
        married two Males together: Such are they who mix <i>Sol</i>
        and <i>Lune</i>, both Corporal and fixt together, whom the
        Spirit will never revive, because there is not conjugal Love.
        Joyn therefore <i>Gabritius</i> to is beloved Sister <i>Beya</i>,
        which is a tender Damsel, and straight-way Gabritius will die;
        that is, will lose what he was; and from that place where he
        appeared to have lost what he was, s shall appear what he was
        not before. </p>
      <p>Answ. 3. <i>What is the Spirit of Life?</i> </p>
      <p>Thirdly, The <i>Spirit of Life</i> is <i>Mercury</i>; the
        Mover saith this Author is <i>Mercury</i>, with which the Stone
        is to be multiplied when it is made: And it must be true <i>Mineral


          Mercury</i>, without any foreign mixture, as <i>Arnold</i>
        resolves expressly in his Answer to <i>Boniface</i>: And so <i>Ripley</i>
        saith, some can multiply <i>Mercury</i> with <i>Saturn</i>,
        and other substances, which we desire; Distill it therefore till
        it be clean, <i>&amp;c</i>. It moreover must have all the
        proportions of <i>Mercury</i> its ponderosity, otherwise it
        could not be Metalline; its Humidity, otherwise the Feminine
        Sperm would be deficient, and it siccity, not to wet the hand;
        which it can no sooner lose by Corrosives or otherwise; but it
        straightway loseth its first Mineral Proportion, and so is no
        longer an Ingredient of our true Tincture. </p>

      <p><i>As the West Latitude is the entrance, so in the North is the
          first alteration.</i> </p>
      <p><i>Proceed then forth to the North by obscuration, &amp;c.
          Loosing them, and altering them, &amp;c</i>. The Materials
        being found, and mixt according to the Proportions taught
        before, is called the <i>West Latitude</i>; because in it the
        Sun sets, and afterwards appears no more in his Red Robes, till
        he first be cloathed with a White glittering Robe, and be
        Crowned with a very bright Oriental Diadem. Now the progress
        into the <i>North</i>, is a discovery of the Profundity of the
        Stone, and is compared to the Winter, which is in the North,
        (chiefly) long, tedious, cold and slobbery; so will it be in
        this Work; the Signs are <i>Capricorn, Pisces</i>, and <i>Aquarius</i>;
        In this there is a retrogradation of <i>Sol</i> into its first
        matter, in which alteration the old Form dies, the Matter rots
        and putrifies; and is after renewed in the East. </p>
      <p><i>This Operation</i> (saith Flammel) <i>is not perfected in
          less then Five Months; and the Colours of the Compound are
          dark, obscure, waterish, and a length black like Pitch; in
          which blackness the Body is rotted into Atoms; which intire
          blackness, and height of corruption last but 2 or 3 days</i>;
        and therefore saith <i>Ripley</i> in his Epistle, <i>the third
          day he shall arise</i>; the same saith <i>Dastin</i> in his <i>Rosary</i>,
        where he allows four days for Putrefaction: The same saith <i>Efferarius</i>
        the Monk in his intire Treatise published with <i>Dastin</i>;
        However, the whole time of blackness, in coming, continuing, and
        going away, is 150 days, although the Sun begins to appear in
        130 days, if you work aright. This I have added for the sake of
        many who expect black of the blackest in 40 or 50 days,
        mistaking <i>Flammel</i> herein; who saith, the colour must be
        black of the blackest, and like to the colour of the <i>Dragons</i>
        in 40 days, which <i>Dragons</i> were blackish, blewish, and
        yellowish, which colours shew that the Matter begins to rot into
        Atoms; which rottenness is not perfected in less than 150 days.
        (so as to let the Sun appear in its Rays;) First in a small

      <p><i>The East denoting Whiteness, is the beginning of the Stones
          Altitude.</i> </p>
      <p><i>Thence by Colours many into the East ascend, &amp;c</i>. In
        the Work are three Dimensions; Altitude, Latitude, and
        Profundity: The Altitude is the Perfection of the Bodies which
        is Inchoate in Whiteness, and compleat in Redness. The
        Profundity is the first Matter into which they are resolved; For
        Multiplication and the Latitude is the means through which it
        passeth from its Perfection to be abased; and from its abasement
        to its Glorification. </p>
      <p>In this passage are infinite gay colours like unto those as
        appeared before Blackness, but more glorious; For note, the
        Stone hath but three colours, Black, White and Red: in the first
        when completed, it stays three, or four days at most; in the
        second as long; in the last it reposeth it self for ever,
        between these Periods as the Matter is moister or dryer, purer
        or impurer, many intermediate colours appear, more than can be
        numbered; But Two, (<i>viz</i>.) Green and Yellow, are of long
        continuance, before White and the Red: But many colours appear
        between the beginning of that Work, and the first colour of
        Blackness: And although several colours appear, yet are they
        dark, foggy, and foul coloured; by which it appears, that
        Blackness is the predominant, which for a space will appear like
        the <i>Aegyptian darkness</i>, and is much about the same
        continuance: so between Blackness and the White, although
        infinite colours appear; yet the Basis of them being Whiteness,
        they are bright, and very glorious, which being only transient,
        pass, and go, and others come in their place, until the White be
        perfected. </p>

          to its redness, is mistaken.</i> </p>
      <p><i>But yet again Two times turn about thy Wheel, &amp;c</i>.
        The Stone being by constant and long Decoction brought to this
        pass; he who thinketh the race quite run, reckons without his
        Host, and must reckon again: It is Medicine of the first Order,
        and must be brought to the third Order by Imbibitions and
        Cibation, which is a second turning round the Wheel; and by
        Fermentation, which is a third running round the Wheel, and
        brings the Medicine to the third Order, and makes it then fit
        for Projection, which at first it is not; For till the medicine
        flow like Wax, it cannot enter <i>Mercury</i> before its
        flight; but the Powder as it is made at first, is like Grains or
        Atoms, and is congealed in a far greater heat, then will make it
        to fume, yet it abides in its form of Dust or Powder, which must
        be otherwise before it be fitted for Projection; therefore the
        Stone tingeth <i>Mercury</i> into a Metalline Mass in the
        twinkling of an eye, as our Author saith in his Preface, even as
        the <i>Basilisk</i> kills by sight: But the Red <i>Sulphur</i>
        converteth Mercury by a digestion of time into its own Nature, (<i>viz</i>.)


        Powder, if it be joyn’d in a due proportion, and digested in a
        due heat: Therefore saith our Author, if you give it too much,
        it must have a Vomit, or it will be sick too long, but the Stone
        will never part with any <i>Mercury</i> that is joined to it in
        heat; our <i>Sulphur</i> then is a Royal infant, which doth
        both hunger and thirst; and if you can but be a Nurse to it as
        you ought, it will repay both your pains and cost: Leave not
        then where you should begin; but go on till you bring it to the
        third Order, which <i>Raymond</i> calls his Oyls and Unguents;
        and so our Author likewise. </p>
      <p>Three Properties there are in which the White and Red <i>Sulphurs</i>
        of the first Order, differ from those of the third Order. </p>
      <p>One flows as easily as any Wax in heat, or on a hot Metal: the
        other in a strong heat abides a Powder. </p>
      <p>The one is like to glass, brittle, ponderous and shining; the
        other a powder like to Atoms. </p>
      <p>The one enters <i>Mercury</i> like an Oyl, and Coagulates it
        in an instant: the other drinks up <i>Mercury</i> only, as the
        Calx of a Metal would do, but will not retain it, if the Fire be
        increased strong, nor turn it into Metal; but if the heat and
        proportion be both as they ought, by a digestion of Time, it
        turns it into its own Nature: And so, (as <i>Ripley</i> saith
        truly,) you may Multiply both White and Red with <i>Mercury</i>;
        That if at first you had not enough to fill a spoon, yet in
        short time you may be stored for your whole life, were it ten
        times as long as it is like to be. </p>

        the <i>Sulphur</i> is: or four parts <i>Sol</i> and <i>Luna</i>,
        and the <i>Sulphur</i> a fifth part; then with <i>Mercury</i>
        digest and putrifie your Ferment, and congeal it, and again
        Ferment it, till it flow like Wax or Oyl; then will that Oyl fix
        <i>Mercury</i>, and turn any Metal into perfection; which you
        may then Multiply at your pleasure, or you may multiply it
        before Fermentation: Then take the perfect Stone for your Body,
        and mix him with the White Wife in proportion as at first, and
        add the Spirit of Life, as at first, and digest it till it pass

      <p>Thus doth our Author conclude his Erroneous Experiments also: <i>I
          never saw true work but one</i>, saith he. One he did, but it
        was after infinite Errours, and other work no Philosopher ever
        yet saw, which he briefly describes. </p>
      <p><i>Remember Man the most Noble Creature, &amp;c</i>. that is
        Gold; It is an errour to write it, (Remember that Man is the
        most Noble Creature of Earthly Composition;) For Man is not of
        Earthly Composition, but Stones, Metals, and Clays, <i>&amp;c</i>.
        are. Now because we seek the Noblest of Creatures of Earthly
        Composition, we must be so wise as to take it for our Principle:
        For as he saith elsewhere; <i>as Fire of burning the Principle
          is, so the Principle of Gilding is Gold I wis</i>. In this
        noblest Creature he saith, are the four Elements proportioned by
        nature, which makes it incombustible, for were any predominant,
        it would not abide; but as <i>Trevisan</i> saith, the Anatical
        proportioning the elements in a metalline matter, is the very
        form of Gold: or that rather which gives it its form. He adds a
        natural Mercuriality, which costeth right nought; that is a
        pure, sincere Mineral Water: without adulteration, not Artifical
        out of <i>Saturn, Jupiter, &amp;c</i>. But natural not a dear <i>Mercury</i>:
        but that which is common and cheap. He adds one of his <i>Minera</i>’s


        by Art is brought, that is our green <i>Lyon</i>, for with our
        first Menstrue, we Calcine only perfect bodies; but none which
        are unclean, except one, which is usually call’d by Pilosophers
        the <i>Lyon-Green</i>, into this the clearness of the Sun or of
        the Moon, secretly descends: that is, by this the Mercuriality,
        or profundity of the Sun and Moon are manifested by exuberation,
        but is hidden from sight a long time; till after putrefaction,
        it exuberates and appears openly, bleeding and changing colours,
        and at first being cloathed in a glorious Green: of which saith
        the Rosary, O happy Greenness, without which nothing can spring?
        This exuberate-<i>Mercury</i> is our hidden Stone, that is,
        Potentially, for when that appears; repugnant natures are tyed
        to unity, that is our <i>Green-Lyon</i>, or <i>Minera</i>, or
        vegetable humidity, or Mercuriality natural, which costeth right
        naught, or our first Menstrue, and the noblest Creature of
        Earthly composition, which is either the Sun, or Moon, but
        especially the Sun: In each of which the Mercuriality is
        invisible, and appears not to sight; but by effect, that is, in
        the quality of clearness, with Whiteness in one, and with
        redness in the other, these three being United, the <i>Mercury</i>
        of the Sun exuberates and appears at first green, then is the
        Eclipse near, and the Northern progress, the process after all
        this is short; this one thing putrifies, then wash hi in his own
        broth, till he become White, then Ferment him wisely; there is
        the beginning, middle and end. <i>Glory be to God</i>. </p>

      <p><i>When busie at my Book I was upon a certain Night,</i> <br>
        <i>This Vision here exprest appear’d unto my dimmed sight:</i> <br>
        <i>A Toad full Ruddy I saw, did drink the juice of Grapes so

        <i>Till over-charged with the broth, his Bowels all to brast:</i>

        <i>And after that, from poyson’d Bulk he cast his Venom fell.</i>
        <br>
        <i>For Grief and pain whereof his Members all began to swell;</i>
        <br>
        <i>With drops of Poysoned sweat approaching this his secret Den,</i>
        <br>
        <i>His Cave with blast of fumous Air he all bewhited then:</i> <br>
        <i>And from the which in space a Golden Humour did ensue,</i> <br>
        <i>Whose falling drops from high did stain the soyl with ruddy
          hue.</i> <br>
        <i>And when his Corps the force of vital breath began to lack,</i>
        <br>
        <i>This dying Toad became forthwith like Coal for colour Black:</i>
        <br>
        <i>Thus drowned in his proper veins of poisoned flood;</i> <br>
        <i>For term of Eighty days and Four he rotting stood</i> <br>
        <i>By Tryal then this Venom to expel I did desire;</i> <br>
        <i>For which I did commit his Carkass to a gentle Fire:</i> <br>
        <i>Which done, a Wonder to the sight, but more to be rehearst;</i>
        <br>
        <i>The Toad with Colours rare through every side was pierc’d;</i>
        <br>
        <i>Which after being tincted Ruddy, for evermore did last.</i> <br>
        <i>Then of the Venom handled thus a Medicine I did make;</i> <br>
        <i>Which Venom kills, and saveth such as Venom chance to take:</i>
        <br>
        <i>Glory be to him the granter of such secret ways,</i> <br>

        <br>
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>This Vision is a Parable rather or Enigm, which the Ancient
        Wise Philosophers have been wont to use often in setting out
        their secrets; this Liberty is granted to all men for to make
        use of Enigmatical expressions, to decipher that which is indeed
        mysterious. The Ancient <i>Egyptians</i> taught much by
        Hieroglyphicks, which way many Fathers of this Science have
        followed; but most especially they have made use of Mystical or
        Cabalistical descriptions; such is this. But to the thing in
        hand. </p>
      <p><i>A Toad full ruddy I saw. ---</i> </p>
      <p>Here we have a Toad described, and in it the whole secret of
        Philosophers: The Toad is Gold; so called, because it is an
        earthly Body, but most especially for the black stinking
        venomosity which this operation comes to in the first days of
        its preparation, before the whiteness appear; during the Rule of
        <i>Saturn</i>, therefore it is called the ruddy Toad. </p>
      <p>To this Authors assent with one accord; when they say our stone
        is nothing else but Gold digested unto the highest degree, to
        which Nature and Art, can bring it; and again the first work,
        saith another Philosopher, is to sublime <i>Mercury</i>, and
        then into clean Mercury to put clean bodies: many witnesses I
        could bring, yea the whole current of writers run this way: And
        what if some subtle <i>Philosophers </i>seem to deny this, on
        purpose to deceive the unwary? We shall not make it our work to
        reconcile them; (though we might) for many of them wrote very
        enviously, on purpose to ensnare; all of them wrote
        mysteriously, as much as they could to darken the truth: and at
        the best none of them were but men, and described things
        according to their apprehensions in Philosophy, none of them
        wrote in every thing the naked truth; for then the Art would
        become so easie, that it would be contemned. But what needs
        words? We know the Truth, and we know by a secret Character,
        true Writers from Sophisters; and we need no Arguments being
        eye-witnesses our selves, and know that there is but one truth;
        nor but one path, even the beaten path in which all who ever
        have attained this Art have trodden, nor can we be deceived our
        selves; nor would we deceive others. </p>
      <p><i>Did drink the juice of Grapes.</i> </p>
      <p>This Toad is said to drink the juice of Grapes according to the
        Philosopher, the body, saith he, is not nobler than Gold, nor
        yet the water more precious than wine. This water they call
        sometimes <i>Aqua Ardens</i>, sometimes <i>Acetum Acerrimum</i>,
        but most commonly they call it their <i>Mercury</i>; this
        denomination I shall not insist upon; but shall assure you that
        it only deciphers <i>Mercury</i>, even that <i>Mercury</i>, of
        which I writ in my little Latine Treatise, called <i>Introitus
          apertus ad occlusum Regis palatium</i>; in that I discovered
        the whole Truth fully and nakedly, and if not too plainly, I am
        sure plain enough. I shall not here repeat; to that I remit the
        Reader. </p>
      <p>This juice of Grapes this Toad is said to drink; that is not
        only in the gross Conjunction, which is an Impastation of the
        Body, with the Water to the temper of <i>Dough</i> or <i>Leaven</i>,
        which the Water readily doth: such affinity there is between the
        Water and the Body; as the Philosopher saith, this Water is
        friendly and pleasant to the metals. But over, and besides the
        Water soaks Radically into our Body; being circulated upon it,
        according as the Philosopher saith, When its own sweat is
        returned to the Body, it perforates to marvelously. Thus the
        Body drinks I the Water, or Juice of Grapes, not so much then
        when they are first mingled: but most especially, when by
        decoction it pierceth radically to the very profundity of it;
        and makes it to alter its Form; This is the Water which reareth
        the Bodies, and makes them no Bodies, but flying Spirits like a
        Smoak, Wind of Fume, as <i>Artephius</i> speaketh plentifully.
      </p>
      <p>This operation is performed in a short while, in comparison of
        Subterraneal operations of Nature, which are done in a very long
        time; therefore I is that so many Philosophers say, that it is
        done in a very short time, and yet it is not without cause, that
        so many of the Philosophers have complained of the length of
        this decoction. </p>
      <p>Therefore the same <i>Artephius</i> who had said, that this
        fire of the Water of our <i>Mercury</i>, doth that in a short
        time above ground, what Nature was performing in a 1000 years,
        doth in another place say, that the tincture doth not come out
        at once, but little and little each day, and hour, till after a
        long time the decoction be compleat, according to the saying of
        the Philosopher: Boyl, boyl, and again boyl, and accompt not
        tedious our long decoction. </p>
      <p><i>So fast.</i> </p>
      <p>So then this expression here, that the Toad doth drink in the
        Juice of Grapes <i>so fast</i>, doth not imply but that this
        work must have the true time of Nature; which is indeed a long
        time, and so is every decoction at least: so they will seem to
        the Artist who attends the fire day by day, and yet mist wait
        for the fruit with Patience, till the Heaven have showred down
        upon the Earth, the former and latter Rain: yet be not out of
        heart, but attend until the compleatment, for then a large
        Harvest will abundantly recompence all thy toyl. </p>
      <p><i>Till over-charged with the Broth, his Bowels all to brast.</i>
      </p>
      <p>It follows in the Vision, that at length the Toad (over-charged
        with the broth) did burst asunder; This broth is the same which
        the fair <i>Medea</i> did prepare, and pour upon the two
        Serpents which did keep the Golden Apples, which grew in the
        hidden Garden of the Virgins <i>Hesperides</i>. </p>
      <p>For the Vinegre of the Philosophers being circulated upon the
        Body, doth engender a substance like unto bloudy Broth, and
        makes Colours of the Rainbow, to appear in the ascension and
        descension of your <i>Lyon</i>, until the <i>Eagles</i> have
        at length devoured the <i>Lyon</i>, and all together being
        killed with the Carion of the Carcasses become a venomous Toad,
        creeping on the Earth, and a Crow swimming in the midst of the
        dead Sea. </p>
      <p>The Juice of Grapes then, which is our <i>Mercury</i>, drawn
        from the Chameleon or Air of our Physical <i>Magnesia</i>, and
        <i>Chalybs</i> Magical, being circulated upon our true <i>Terra
          Lemnia</i>; after it is grosly mixed with it by Incorporation,
        and set to our fire to digest, doth still enter in and upon our
        Body, and searcheth the profoundity of it; and makes the occult
        to become manifest by continual ascension and descension: till
        all together become a Broth; which is a mean substance of
        dissevered qualities, between the Water and the Body, till at
        length the Body burst asunder and be reduced into a Powder, like
        to the Atoms of the Sun, black of the blackest and of a viscous
        matter. </p>
      <p><i>And after that, from poisoned bulk he cast his venom fell.</i>
      </p>
      <p>This Reduction of the Body, thus in this water ingenders so
        venomous a Nature, that truly in the whole World there is not a
        ranker Poyson, or stink, according as Philosophers witness: and
        therefore he is said to cast his fell venom from his poisoned
        bulk; in as much as the exhalation are compared to the Invenomed
        Fume of Dragons, as <i>Flamell</i> in his Summary hath such an
        Allusion. But the Philosopher (as he adds in his <i>Hieroglyphicks</i>
        of the two Dragons,) never feels his sink, unless he break his
        Vessels, but only he judgeth it by the colours proceeding from
        the rottenness of the Confections. </p>
      <p>And indeed it is a wonder to consider, (which some Sons of Art
        are eye-witnesses of) that the fixed and most digested Body of
        Gold; should so rot and putrifie, as if it were a Carcass, which
        is done by the admirable Divine virtue of our dissolving Water,
        which no Money can purchase. All these operations, which are so
        enlarged by variety of expressions, center in one, which killing
        the quick, and reviving the dead. </p>
      <p><i>For grief and pain whereof his members all began to swell.</i>
      </p>
      <p>This venomous fume of exhalations returning upon the Body,
        cause it to swell all over according to the saying of the
        Philosopher; The Body in this Water puffet up, swelleth and
        putrifieth as a Grain of Corn, taking the nature living and
        vegetable, therefore for this cause this Water is in this sense
        called by the Philosophers their Leaven, for as Leaven causeth
        Past to swell, so this fermenteth the body, and causeth it to
        tumefie and puff up; it is also called venom, for as venom
        causeth swelling, so this Water by its reiteration uncessantly
        upon our body. </p>
      <p>This operation is uncessant from the first incitation of the
        matter, even until compleat putrefaction; for the Toad doth
        always send forth his exhalations (being rather called the <i>Lyon</i>,)


        till he be over-come in part: and then when the Body begins a
        little to put on the Nature of the Water, and the Water of the
        Body, ten it is compared to two Dragons, one winged, and the
        other without wings: and lastly when that stinking Earth
        appears, which <i>Hermes</i> calls his <i>Terra Foliata</i>,
        or Earth of Leaves, then it is most properly called the Toad of
        the Earth; from the first excitation, even to the last of this
        putrefaction: which exhalations are at the beginning for a time
        White, and afterwards become Yellowish, Blewish, and Blackish,
        (from the virulency of the matter) which exhalation hourly
        condensing, and ever and anon running down like little veins in
        drops, do enter the Body marvelously, and the more it is entred;
        the more it swells and puffs up, till at length it be completely
        putrefied. </p>
      <p><i>With drops of poisoned sweat, approaching thus his secret
          Den.</i> </p>
      <p>The following two Verses then are but a more ample description
        of this work; of volatilization which is an ascension, and
        descension, or circulation of the confections within the Glass.
        Which Glass here called the secret Den, is else-where called by
        the same Author, a little Glassen-tun, and is an oval Vessel; of
        the purest White Glass, about the bigness of an ordinary
        Hen-Egg, in the which about the quantity of an ounce of 8
        drachms of the confection, in all mixed is a convenient
        proportion to be set, which being Seal’d up with <i>Hermes</i>
        Seal, the Glass having a neck about 6 fingers high, or
        thereabouts, which being thin and narrow; is melted together
        Artificially, that no Spirits can get out, nor no Air can come
        in, in which respect it is named a secret Den. </p>
      <p>Also it is called a secret Den, because of the secretness of
        Ashes or Sand, in which in a Philosophical Athanor it is set,
        the doores being firmly shut up, and a prospect left to look I
        by a Window, either to open a little, as much as s convenient
        sometimes, as occasion requires, or else with Glass put into it,
        to admit the view of the Artist; together with a light at hand
        to shew the colours. </p>
      <p><i>His Cave with blasts of fumous Air, he all bewhited then.</i>
      </p>
      <p>Which Glass, Nest, and Furnace being thus secretly ordered, the
        Artist must in the first place expect to be in Prison a long
        time, as <i>Bernard Trevisan</i> saith, for the Concave of this
        secret place, will be so whitened with the fumes which ascend,
        that an Artist rules his work more by skill and reason, or the
        eye of the mind, then of the Body, for the Spirits arising like
        a smoak or Wind, sticketh to the Concave of the Glass, which is
        above the Sand or Ashes, and there by degrees, there grow drops
        which run down and moisten the Body below, and reduce as much as
        they can of the fixed, and so the Body by the Water, and the
        Water by the Body alter their colours. </p>
      <p><i>And from the which in space a Golden Humour did ensue.</i> </p>
      <p>In so much that at length, the whole Vessel will seem as though
        it were over gilded with Gold, for the exhalations will be
        Yellow, which is a sign of true Copulation of our Man &amp;
        Woman together, but before this Yellow, and with it there will
        be an obscuring of the White brightness of the Fume, with the
        mixture of colours, Dark, obscure and Blewish. </p>
      <p>The space is not long, for all the several passages are
        conspicuous before 40 days; for in that space from these
        Colours, are demonstrating Signs of Corruption and Generation,
        which is given us by the biting, and fiery Nature of our pontick
        Waters, and the resistance of our Bodies; in which Fight the
        Body is over-come, and killed, and dying yields these Colours:
        which is a Sign that the Eagles now are getting the Mastery, and
        that our Lyon hath also a little infected them with his Carcass,
        which they begin to prey upon. This Operation is by Ingenious
        Artists called Extraction of Natures, and Separation, for the
        Tincture begins now to be separated from the Body. Also
        Reduction to the first matter; which is Sperm or Seed, which by
        reason of its double Nature, is compared to two Dragons. I shall
        not enlarge in this Vision, but briefly unfold what is briefly
        laid down. </p>
      <p><i>Whose falling drops from high did stain the soyl with ruddy
          hue.</i> </p>
      <p>These colours of the Mercury, do affect the subsident fixed
        Body, with sutable colours and the Bodies from these exhalation,
        be Tincted with a ruddy colour, which <i>Flamel</i> expresseth
        to this purpose, that these two Natures, or Dragons do bite one
        another very cruelly; and never leave from the time they have
        seised one upon another; till by their slavering Venom, and
        mortal hurts, they be all of a gore bloud, and then being stewed
        in their own Venom, are changed into a fifth Essence. </p>
      <p><i>And when his Corps the force of vital breath began to lack.</i>
      </p>
      <p>But before the renovation of these Natures, they must in the
        first place pass through the Eclipse, both of the Sun and Moon
        and the darkness of Purgatory, which is the gate of Blackness,
        and after that they shall be renovated with the light of
        Paradise. </p>
      <p>This Allegorically is called Death, for as a man will resist
        violence, which entrencheth upon his life as long as he can, but
        if his enemies are many and mighty, at length they grow too
        mighty for him, and he begins to fail both in strength and
        courage, and so Paleness, the Harbinger of Death, doth stand as
        it were upon his lips, so our Body or Man the <i>Sun</i>, like
        a strong Champion, doth resist long, till he be wounded, and
        bleed as it were all over, and then dies, at whose death
        blackness doth begin to appear, as of old the Ravens were
        foretellers of Mans death approaching: for this Reiteration of
        Rotation of the Influences of the Heaven of it, together with
        Heat still drying up and soaking in the Moisture as fast as it
        falls, brings it at last naturally to die and corrupt, as any
        other thing doth. </p>
      <p>And then the Corps begin to lack breath; that is, the Fumes
        begin to cease: for with oft ascending and descending the
        Spirits are somewhat fixed, and turned into Powder or Dust, and
        are now in the bottom of the Vessel, drawing fast to
        Putrefaction: Nor do they for a time ascend, but remain below. </p>
      <p>Wherefore govern your Fire, that your Spirits be no so exalted,
        and climb so high that the Earth want them, and they return no
        more: For this Operation is, as <i>Morien</i> saith, a drawing
        out of Water from the earth, and again a returning of the same
        to the earth, so often and so long till the Earth putrefie. </p>
      <p><i>This dying Toad became forthwith like Coal for colour black.</i>
      </p>
      <p>This is the final end of the Combat, for herein in this Earth
        of Leaves all are reconciled, and final Peace is made; and now
        one nature embraceth another, in no other form but in the form
        of a Powder impalpable, and in no other colour but black of the
        blackest. </p>
      <p>From henceforth Natures are united, and boil and bubble
        together like melted Pitch, and change their forms one into
        another. Take heed therefore lest instead of Powder Black of the
        Blackest, which is the Crows Bill, you have an unprofitable dry
        half red Precipitate, Orange-coloured, which is a certain sign
        of the Combustion of Flowers, or Vertue of the Vegetative Seed,
        On this very Rock I have stumbled, and do therefore warn you. </p>
      <p><i>Thus drowned in his proper Veins of poisoned Flood.</i> </p>
      <p>It appears by all that hath been said, and by the undoubted
        Testimony of all Philosophers who have been Eye-witnesses to
        this truth, that the work is not so tedious, nor chargeable, but
        that in the simplest way of Nature the mastery is to be
        attained: for when once the true body is impacted with its true
        Leven, it doth calcine it self, and dissolve it self for the
        dissolution of the Body into a black and changeable coloured
        Water, which is the sign of egrettion of the Tincture, is the
        Congelation of the Spirits into this lowest Period of Obscurity,
        which is this black Powder like unto Lamp-Black, this is the
        Complement of Eclipsation, which Contrition begins soon after
        the Colours, Yellowish, Blewish, <i>&amp;c</i>. </p>
      <p><i>For term of Eighty Days and Four he rotting stood.</i> </p>
      <p>This Calcination begins with these Variations in Colour about
        the two and fortieth day, or fiftieth at the farthest, in a good
        Regimen: After which comes putrefying Corruption, like to the
        Scum of boiling bloody Broath or melted Pitch; but Blackness in
        part, <i>to wit, Superficial</i>, begins about the fortieth day
        after the stirring up of the matter, in case of right Progress
        and Regimen of the Fire, or about the fiftieth at farthest. But
        this drowning of him in his own Poyson, and stewing him in his
        own Broath, is the intire Blackness and Cimmerian utter Darkness
        of compleat Rottenness, which according to the Author, is for
        the space of eighty four days. This time is not certainly agreed
        upon by Authors: But in this they all agree, they prescribe so
        long time until the Complement. One writes, <i>That this
          blackest Black indures a long time, and is not destroyed in
          less than five months</i>. Another writes, <i>That the King
          when he enters into his Bath pulls of his Robe, and gives it
          to Saturn, from whom he receives a Black Shirt, which he keeps
          forty two days</i>: And indeed it is two and forty days before
        he put on this Black Shirt instead of his Golden Robe, that is,
        be destroyed as touching his Solary Qualities, and become
        instead of Fixt, Citrine, Terrene, and Solid, a Fugitive, Black,
        Spiritual, Watery, and Flegmatick Substance: But Putridness
        begins not till the first Forms be put off; for so long as the
        Body may be reduced into its former Nature, it is not yet well
        ground and imbibed; grind therefore and imbibe, till thou see
        the Bodies to become no Bodies, but a Fume and Wind, and then
        circulating for a season, thou shalt see them settle and
        putrifie. </p>
      <p><i>Saturn</i> then will hold the Earth, which is Occidental,
        Retentive and Autumnal, in the West; then proceed to the North,
        where <i>Mercury</i> holdeth the Water, where the Matter is
        Watery and Flegmatick, and it is Winter, and the North
        expulsive. But they who divide the Operation into <i>Saturn</i>’s



        Rule, and after him succeeding <i>Jupiter</i>, ascribe to <i>Saturn</i>
        the whole of Putridness, and to <i>Jupiter</i> the time of
        variety of Colours. After <i>Jupiter</i>, who holds but twenty
        or two and twenty days, comes <i>Luna</i>, the third Person,
        bright and fair, and she holds twenty good days, sometimes two
        over and above: In this Computation it is good to count from the
        fortieth or fiftieth day of the first beginning of the Stone, to
        the fourteenth or sixteenth day of <i>Jupiter</i>’s Reign,
        wherein in the washing of <i>Laton</i> there is still
        Blackness, though mixed with variety of gay Colours, which
        amounteth to the sum of days allowed by the Author in
        Putrefaction, to wit, Eighty four days. Accounting intire
        Blackness, with <i>Augurellus</i>, after four time eleven days
        and nights, which make four and forty: Or, according to another
        Philosopher, which saith, <i>In the first Fifty Days here
          appears the True Crow, and after it in Threescore and Ten Days
          the White Dove; and after in Fourscore and Ten days the Tyrian
          Colour</i>. </p>
      <p><i>By Tryal then this Venom to expel I did desire;</i> <br>
        <i>For which I did commit his Carcass to a gentle Fire.</i> </p>
      <p><i>Which done, a Wonder to the sight, but more to be rehearst;</i>
        <br>
        <i>The Toad with Colours rare through every side was pierc’d.</i>
      </p>
      <p><i>And white appear’d when all the sundry hews were past;</i> <br>
        <i>Which after being tincted, ruddy for evermore did last.</i> </p>
      <p>I shall add my own Sentence: Mix thy two Natures well, and if
        thy matter by pure, both the Body, and the Water, and the
        internal Heat of thy Bath as it ought to be, and the external
        Fire gentle, and not violent; yet so that the Matter may
        circulate, and Spiritual Nature on the Corporal, in six and
        forty or fifty days expect the beginning of intire Blackness;
        and after six and fifty days more, or sixty, expect the Peacocks
        Tayl, and Colours of the Rainbow; and after two and twenty days
        more, or four and twenty, expect <i>Luna</i> perfect, the
        Whitest White, which will grow more and more glorious for the
        space of twenty days, or two and twenty at the most: After
        which, in a little more increased Fire, expect the Rule of <i>Venus</i>
        for the space of forty days, or two and forty; and after it the
        Rule of <i>Mars</i> two and forty days more; and after him the
        Rule of <i>Sol flavus</i> forty days, or two and forty: And
        then in a moment comes the Tyrian Colour, the sparkling Red, the
        fiery Vermillion, and Red Poppy of the Rock. </p>
      <p><i>Then of the Venom handled thus a Medicine I did make,</i> <br>
        <i>Which Venom kills, and saveth such a Venom chance to take.</i>
      </p>
      <p>Thus onely by Deccotion these Natures are changed and altered
        so wonderfully to this blessed Tincture. Which expelleth all
        Poyson, though it self were a deadly Poyson before the
        Preparation, yet after it is the Balsam of Nature, expelling all
        Diseases, and cutting them of as it were with one Hook, all that
        are accidental to Humane frail Body, which is wonderful. </p>
      <p><i>Glory be to Him the Grantor of such secret Ways;</i> <br>
        <i>Dominion and Honour both, with Worship and with Praise. Amen.</i>
      </p>
      <p>Now God only is the Dispenser of these glorious Mysteries: I
        have been a true Witness of nature unto thee, and I know that I
        write true, and all Sons of Art shall by my Writings know that I
        am a Fellow heir with them of this Divine Skill. To the ignorant
        I have wrote so plain as may be, and more I had written if the
        Creator of all things had give me larger Commission. Now to Him
        alone, as is due, be all Honour, and Power, and Glory, who made
        all things, and giveth knowledge to whom he listeth of his
        Servants, and conceals where he pleaseth: To Him be ascribed, as
        due is, all Service and Honour. And no, Brother, whoever
        enjoyeth this rare Blessing of God, improve all thy strength to
        do him service with it, for he is worthy of it, who hath created
        all things, and for whose sake they were and are created. </p>

      <p><i>Calcination lapidem mostrum purgat, calorem naturalem

          Destruit siquidem Corpora Calcination omnis, lapidis humorem
