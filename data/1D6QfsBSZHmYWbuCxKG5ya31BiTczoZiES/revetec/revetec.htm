      <p>The Revetec cam-drive engine uses a pair of counter-rotating
        scissor cams instead of a crankshaft. The result is three times
        more torque than a conventional engine, and an overall engine
        efficiency up to 50% more. </p>

      </center>
      <p><b>&nbsp;CCE Engine Technology Overview</b> </p>
      <p>The REVETEC Engine design consists of two counter-rotating
        “trilobate” (three lobed) cams geared together, so both cams
        contribute to forward motion. Two bearings run along the profile
        of both cams (four bearings in all) and stay in contact with the
        cams at all times. The bearings are mounted on the underside of
        the two inter-connected pistons, which maintain the desired
        clearance throughout the stroke. </p>
      <p>The two cams rotate and raise the piston with a scissor-like
        action to the bearings. Once at the top of the stroke the
        air/fuel mixture is fired. The expanded gas then forces the
        bearings down the ramps of the cams spreading them apart ending
        the stroke. The point of maximum mechanical advantage or
        transfer is around 20-30deg ATDC (the piston moving
        approximately 10% of its travel) making the most of the high
        cylinder pressure. This compares to a conventional engine that
        reaches maximum mechanical advantage around 60-70deg ATDC.
        (after the piston has moved through approximately just over 40%
        of its travel, losing valuable cylinder pressure). </p>
      <p>The effective cranking distance is determined by the length
        from the point of bearing contact to the centre of the output
        shaft (NOT the stroke). A conventional engine's turning distance
        is half of the piston stroke. The piston acceleration throughout
        the stroke is controlled by the cam “grind” which can be altered
        to give acceleration to suit a certain fuel and/or torque
        application and/or rev range. Our trilobe cams are asymmetrical
        which also allows different port timing on opposite strokes,
        increasing efficiency on 2-Stroke engines. </p>
      <p>The piston assembly slides rigidly through the block via an oil
        pressure fed guiding system eliminating piston to cylinder-bore
        contact. This reduces wear and lubrication requirements in the
        cylinder. This also reduces piston side shock to a negligible
        amount making ceramic technology suitable. </p>
      <p>One module can either comprise of two trilobate cams and either
        two or four pistons. The counter rotation is performed by a
        reverse gear set at a 1:3 ratio shaft providing two strokes of a
        piston to 360 degrees of output shaft rotation. This provides an
        output shaft speed comparable to a conventional engine and
        provides the correct ratio for engine balancing. </p>
      <p>Another feature of the Revetec engine is that 60% of downward
        force applied to the main journal via the crankshaft is
        deflected to rotational force increasing efficiency in the
        Revetec engine. The image to the right shows the bearings under
        the piston (Note: The second bearing on the reverse rotating cam
        is hidden behind the front bearing - side by side). As the
        piston pushes down on the bearing the load (shown in yellow)
        forces the trilobe cams to spread. The deflected force is
        deflected into the opposing counter-rotating trilobe cam. The
        contact angle between the point of bearing contact (shown in
        purple) produces the torque lever (shown in red). The trilobe
        and bearing sizes determine how long the high leverage occurs
        and is designed for each individual engine characteristic we are
        wanting to achieve. </p>
      <p>The Revetec “trilobate” design is very different in regards to
        piston position in the compression and ignition areas. The down
        stroke is the same as a conventional engine. The difference is
        that the travel of the piston on the up stroke is reversed,
        meaning that at 90deg after BDC the piston moves over half the
        way up the stroke at the equivalent point of a crankshaft
        rotating 90degrees. This results in the piston travelling faster
        initially than a conventional engine. The result of this
        phenomenon is that when the cylinder is fired, the piston is
        closer to TDC than a conventional engine. This provides more
        fuel molecules between the spark plug. We then reduce the amount
        of fuel (leaner mixture) to provide the correct firing mixture.
        This feature is most noticeable between the 2,000-4,000rpm
        range, where most driving occurs. This feature also increases
        thermal efficiency within the chamber. Another feature of
        extended dwell is that in a conventional engine, it is normal to
        inject up to 60% more fuel on a cold start. We have been able to
        reduce this down to 7% more fuel, reducing cold start fuel
        consumption and emissions. </p>

      <p>"Leap had conducted an independent analysis which shows that
        the REVETC CCE engine can produce about three times the torque
        compared to a conventional engine with crankshaft for a given
        piston pressure profile." Summaries of CCE advantages are as
        follows: Approximately one quarter the size and weight of a
        conventional engine (for similar applications) combined with
        improved output substantially increases power/weight and
        torque/weight ratio... </p>
      <p>Fewer moving and total components. As a result of fewer
        components, more easily manufactured than conventional engines.
        <br>
        Identical cylinder head assembly (“top end”) to conventional
        engines. Most existing head technology can be either adapted or
        utilised. <br>
        Flexible design --- can be four-stroke, two-stroke, petrol,
        diesel or gas, natural of forced aspiration. <br>
        Eliminated irregularly reciprocating components such as
        connecting rods. <br>
        Output shaft can be run in either direction if multilobed cams
        with symmetrical lobes are employed. <br>
        All rotational forces are counteracted via the counter rotating
        cam --- eliminates the need for a heavy flywheel. <br>
        Torque and power output can be varied using a fixed capacity and
        piston stroke. <br>
        The CCE can be designed to operate at greatly reduced operating
        speeds while delivering high torque output. <br>
        Substantial reduction in stroke reduces heat loss through
        cylinder wall. <br>
        Extended piston dwell is possible because engine design allows a
        lower than normal compression ratio to be used reducing power
        loss from compression cycle. <br>
        Maximum mechanical advantage can be applied to output shaft at
        only 10 degrees ATDC utilising high cylinder pressure early in
        the stroke, compared to around 60 degrees ATDC for conventional
        engines. Lower emissions can be achieved due to increased
        control over combustion. <br>
        Extremely low idle speed due to increase in mechanical
        efficiency at the top of the stroke. <br>
        Little or no bore contact/piston side thrust, which reduces wear
        on cylinder bore. <br>
        Can have different port timing on compression stroke than power
        stroke allowing better control two-stroke). <br>
        Lower centre of gravity. <br>
        Due to controlled piston acceleration rates the CCE reduces
        engine vibration. <br>
        A hollow output shaft can be utilised for specialty
        applications, such as peristaltic pumps. </p>
      <p>The advantages of Revetec’s engine technology can be applied to
        most internal and external combustion engines for use in motor
        vehicles, trucks, buses, motorcycles, pumps and generators,
        light aircraft engines, diesel and marine engines. </p>
      <p>The CCE integrates well with existing power plants and can
        utilise almost all existing engine technology with increased
        efficiency. The CCE engine is extremely well suited for high
        torque applications such as generators, machinery and light
        aircraft. </p>

      <p><b>Abstract</b> --- An engine comprises two counter rotating
        multilobate cams which are acted upon by a pair of diametrically
        opposed pistons which are rigidly interlinked by connecting
        rods. Differential gearing is provided to time the counter
        rotation of the cams. The following is an examiner's statement
        of reasons for allowance: The prior art fails to teach or fairly
        suggest the invention as a whole including a shaft having a
        first multilobate cam axially fixed to said shaft and an
        adjacent second multilobate cam differentially geared to said
        first multilobate cam for axial counter rotation about said
        shaft, at least one pair of cylinders, the cylinders of each
        pair being diametrically opposed with respect to said shaft with
        said multilobate cams interposed therebetween, and a piston in
        each said cylinder, said pistons of a pair of cylinders being
        rigidly interconnected. </p>
      <p><b>Description</b> </p>
      <p><b>TECHNICAL FIELD</b> </p>
      <p>This invention relates to internal combustion engines. In
        particular, the invention relates to internal combustion engines
        with improved control over the various cycles of the engine's
        operation. The invention also relates to internal combustion
        engines with improved torque characteristics. </p>
      <p><b>BACKGROUND ART</b> </p>
      <p>Internal combustion engines such as used in automobiles are
        typically of the reciprocating type in which a piston
        oscillating in a cylinder drives a crankshaft via a connecting
        rod. There are numerous disadvantages in conventional
        reciprocating engine design, which disadvantages in large stem
        from the reciprocating motion of the piston and connecting rod.
      </p>
      <p>Many engine designs have been developed to overcome the
        limitations and disadvantages of conventional internal
        combustion engines of the reciprocating type. These developments
        include rotary engines, such the wellknown Wankel engine, and
        engines in which a cam or cams are used in place of at least the
        crankshaft and, in some cases, connecting rods as well. </p>
      <p>Internal combustion engines of the type where a cam or cams
        replace the crankshaft are described, for example, in U.S. Pat.
        No. 4,848,282 and Australian Patent Application No. 17897/76.
        However, while developments in this type of engine have allowed
        some of the disadvantages of conventional reciprocating-type
        engines to be overcome, engines using a cam or cams in place of
        a crankshaft have not been fully exploited. </p>
      <p>It is also known to provide internal combustion engines having
        opposed, interconnected pistons. Such an arrangement is
        described in Australian Patent Application No. 36206/84.
        However, there is no suggestion in this disclosure, and like
        disclosures, that the concept of opposed interconnected pistons
        can be used in conjunction with anything other than a
        crankshaft. </p>
      <p><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>It is an object of the present invention to provide an internal
        combustion engine of the camming rotary type which may have
        improved torque and engine cycle control characteristics. It is
        also an object of the present invention to provide an internal
        combustion engine which may overcome at least some of the
        disadvantages of existing internal combustion engines. </p>
      <p>According to a broad format, this invention provides an
        internal combustion engine comprising at least one cylinder
        module, said cylinder module comprising: </p>
      <p>a shaft having a first multilobate cam axially fixed to said
        shaft and an adjacent second multilobate cam differentially
        geared to said first multilobate cam for axial counter rotation
        about said shaft; </p>
      <p>at least one pair of cylinders, the cylinders of each which
        pair are diametrically opposed with respect to said shaft with
        said multilobate cams interposed therebetween: and </p>
      <p>a piston in each said cylinder, which pistons of a pair of
        cylinders are rigidly interconnected; </p>
      <p>wherein, said multilobate cams each comprise 3+n lobes where n
        is zero or an even-numbered integer; </p>
      <p>and wherein, reciprocating motion of said pistons in said
        cylinders imparts rotary motion to said shaft via contact
        between said pistons and the camming surfaces of said
        multilobate cams. </p>
      <p>It will be appreciated from the foregoing passage that the
        crankshaft and connecting rods of a conventional internal
        combustion engine are replaced by a linear shaft and multilobate
        cams in an engine according to the invention. Use of a cam in
        the place of a connecting rod/crankshaft arrangement allows
        greater control over the positioning of a piston throughout the
        cycling of the engine. For example, the period at which a piston
        is at top-dead-center (TDC) can be extended. </p>
      <p>It will be further appreciated from the broad description of
        the invention that although two cylinders are provided in the at
        least one pair of cylinders, a double-acting piston-cylinder
        arrangement is in effect provided by the opposed cylinders with
        interconnected pistons. The rigid interconnection of pistons
        also eliminates torsional twisting and minimizes piston to
        cylinder wall contact thereby reducing friction. </p>
      <p>The use of the two counter-rotating cams allows higher torque
        to be achieved than with conventional internal combustion
        engines. This is because as the piston starts a power stroke, it
        is at maximum mechanical advantage with respect to the cam lobe.
      </p>
      <p>Turning now to more specific details of internal combustion
        engines according to the invention, as noted above such engines
        include at least one cylinder module. An engine with a single
        cylinder module is merely preferred and engines can have from
        two to six modules. In multi-module engines, a single shaft
        extends throughout all modules, either as a unitary member or as
        interconnected shaft portions. Similarly, the cylinder blocks of
        multi-module engines can be integral with each other or
        separate. </p>
      <p>A cylinder module typically has a single pair of cylinders.
        However, engines according to the invention can also have two
        pairs of cylinders per module. In cylinder modules having two
        pairs of cylinders, the pairs are typically disposed at
        90.degree. to each other. </p>
      <p>With regard to the multilobate cams of engines according to the
        invention, a trilobate cam is preferred. This allows for six
        ignition cycles per cam revolution in a two-stroke engine.
        However, engines can also be configured with cams having five,
        seven, nine or more lobes per cam. </p>
      <p>A lobe of a cam can be asymmetric to control piston speed at a
        particular stage of a cycle, such as to increase the dwell of a
        piston at TDC or at bottom-dead-center (BDC). It will be
        appreciated by those of skill in the art that an extended dwell
        at TDC improves combustion while an extended dwell at BDC allows
        better scavenging. Control of piston speed through lobe profile
        also allows control of piston acceleration and torque
        application. In particular, this allows for greater torque to be
        obtained immediately after TDC than is possible with a
        conventional reciprocating piston engine. Further control
        features provided by a variable piston rate include control of
        port opening speed compared with closing speed and control of
        compression rate with respect to combustion rate. </p>
      <p>The first multilobate cam can be fixed to the shaft by any
        manner known in the art. Attentively, the shaft and first
        multilobate cam can be fabricated as a unitary member. </p>
      <p>The differential gearing which allows counter rotation of the
        first and second multilobate cams, also times cam counter
        rotation. The manner of differentially gearing the cams can be
        by any manner known in the art. For example, bevel gears can be
        provided on opposed faces of the first and second multilobate
        cams with at least one bevelled pinion gear therebetween.
        Preferably, two diametrically opposed pinions are provided. A
        support member, in which the shaft is free to rotate, is
        advantageously provided for supporting pinions. </p>
      <p>The rigid interconnection of pistons typically comprises at
        least two rods therebetween fixed to the undersides of pistons
        adjacent the periphery thereof. Preferably, four rods are used,
        equally spaced about the periphery of a piston. Guide sleeves
        are provided in a cylinder module for rods interconnecting
        pistons. Guide sleeves are typically configured to allow for
        lateral movement of rods on piston expansion and contraction. </p>
      <p>Contact between pistons and the camming surfaces of cams is in
        a manner which minimizes vibration and frictional losses.
        Advantageously, a roller bearing is provided on the underside of
        a piston for contacting each camming surface. </p>
      <p>It will be appreciated that the interconnection of pistons
        comprising a pair of opposed pistons allows control over
        clearance between the contact area of a piston--be it a roller
        bearing, a slide, or the like--and the camming surface of a cam.
        Furthermore, this manner of contact does not require grooves or
        the like in sides of cams to receive a conventional connecting
        rod as is the case with some engines of similar design. This
        feature of engines of similar design on overrun leads to wear
        and excessive noise, which disadvantages are substantially
        avoided in the present invention. </p>
      <p>Engines according to the present invention can be two-stroke or
        four-stroke. In the former case, the combustible fuel mixture is
        typically supplied in conjunction with supercharging. However,
        any form of fuel and air supply can be used in conjunction with
        a four-stroke engine. </p>
      <p>Cylinder modules according to the invention can also serve as
        air or gas compressors. </p>
      <p>Other aspects of engines according to the invention are in
        accordance with what is generally known in the art. However, it
        will be appreciated that only a low pressure oil feed to the
        differential gearing of the multilobate cams is required, thus
        reducing the taxing of horsepower by the oil pump. Furthermore,
        other engine components, including pistons, can be splashfed
        oil. In this regard, it should be noted that oil splashed on to
        pistons by centrifugal force also serves to cool pistons. </p>
      <p>Advantages of engines according to the invention include the
        following: </p>
      <p>engines are compact in design with fewer moving parts; </p>
      <p>engines can be run in either direction if multilobate cams with
        symmetrical lobes are employed; </p>
      <p>engines are lighter than conventional reciprocating-type
        engines; </p>
      <p>engines are more easily manufactured and assembled than
        conventional engines; </p>
      <p>the extended piston dwell possible because of engine design
        allows a lower than normal compression ratio to be used; and </p>
      <p>reciprocating components such as piston-crank shaft connecting
        rods are eliminated. </p>
      <p>Further advantages of engines according to the invention
        because of the multilobate cams employed are that cams can be
        more easily manufactured than crankshafts, cams don't require
        extra balance weights, and, cams double as a flywheel therefore
        providing better momentum. </p>
      <p>Having broadly described the invention, specific embodiments
        will now be exemplified with reference to the accompanying
        drawings, briefly described hereafter. </p>

      <p><b>BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>With reference to FIG. 1, there is shown two-stroke engine 1
        comprising a single cylinder module having a single pair of
        cylinders made up of cylinders 2 and 3. Cylinders 2 and 3 have
        pistons 4 and 5 therein which are interconnected by four rods,
        two of which can be seen at 6a and 6b. </p>
      <p>Engine 1 also includes a central shaft, the axis of which is
        indicated at 7, with which trilobate cams 8 and 9 are
        associated. Cam 9 is in fact co-incident with cam 8 in the view
        shown in the figure since pistons are at TDC or BDC. Pistons 4
        and 5 contact cams 8 and 9 via roller bearings, the positions of
        which are generally indicated at 10 and 11. </p>
      <p>Other features of engine 1 include water jacket 12, spark plugs
        13 and 14, oil sump 15, oil pump pickup 16, and balance shafts
        17 and 18. The location of inlet ports are indicated at 19 and
        20 which also corresponds to the position of exhaust ports. </p>
      <p>Turning now to FIG. 2, cams 8 and 9 are shown in greater detail
        along with shaft 7 and differential gearing which will shortly
        be described. The cross-section shown in FIG. 2 is rotated
        90.degree. in respect of FIG. 1 and the cam lobes are in
        slightly different positions to those shown in FIG. 1. </p>
      <p>The differential, or timing, gearing comprises bevel gear 21 on
        first cam 8, bevel gear 22 on second cam 9, and pinion gears 23
        and 24. Pinion gears 23 and 24 are supported by gear support 25
        which is secured to shaft housing 26. Shaft housing 26, it will
        be appreciated, is part of the cylinder module. Also shown in
        FIG. 2 are flywheel 27, pulley 28 and bearings 29 to 35. </p>
      <p>First cam 8 is essentially an integral part of shaft 7. Second
        cam 9 can, however, counter rotate with respect to cam 8 but is
        timed to the rotation of cam 8 by the differential gearing. </p>
      <p>FIG. 3 shows the underside of piston 3 of FIG. 1 to provide
        detail of the roller bearings. In FIG. 3, piston 3 can be seen
        plus shaft 36 extending between bosses 37 and 38. Roller
        bearings 39 and 40 are carried by shaft 36, which correspond to
        the roller bearings as generally indicated at 10 and 11 of FIG.
        1. </p>
      <p>Interconnecting rods can also be seen in cross-section in FIG.
        3, one of which is indicated at 4a. Sleeves through which
        interconnecting rods pass can be seen, one of which is indicated
        at 41. </p>
      <p>Although FIG. 3 is at a slightly larger scale than FIG. 2, it
        can be appreciated that roller bearings 39 and 40 can contact
        camming surfaces 42 and 43 of cams 8 and 9 of FIG. 2 during
        engine operation. </p>
      <p>The operation of engine 1 can be appreciated from FIG. 1.
        Movement of piston 4 and 5 from left to right on a power stroke
        in cylinder 2 causes rotation of cams 8 and 9 via contact
        therewith through roller bearing 10. A "scissor action" in
        effect occurs. Rotation of cam 8 effects rotation of shaft 7
        while counter-rotating cam 9 also contributes to the rotation of
        shaft 7 by way of the differential gearing (see FIG. 2). </p>
      <p>Because of the scissor action, greater torque is obtained on a
        power stroke than is possible with a conventional engine.
        Indeed, the stroke/piston diameter relationship depicted in FIG.
        1 can tend to a significantly over-square configuration while
        still providing adequate torque. </p>
      <p>Another feature of engines according to the invention revealed
        by FIG. 1 is that the equivalent of the crankcase of a
        conventional engine is sealed with respect to cylinders, unlike
        conventional two-stroke engines. This allows a non-oiled fuel to
        be used, thus reducing engine emission components. </p>
      <p>The control of piston speed and dwell at TDC and BDC using an
        asymmetric cam lobe is depicted in FIG. 4. FIG. 4 is a plot of a
        specific point on a piston as the piston oscillates between
        mid-point 45, TDC 46 and BDC 47. Because of an asymmetric cam
        lobe, the speed of the piston can be controlled. Firstly, it can
        be seen that the piston resides at TDC 46 for an extended period
        of time. Rapid piston acceleration at 48 provides higher torque
        on the combustion cycle while a slower piston speed at 49 at the
        end of the combustion cycle allows better port control. On the
        other hand, a faster piston speed at the start of the
        compression cycle 50 allows faster port closure for better fuel
        economy while a slow piston speed at the end 51 of that cycle
        gives better mechanical advantage. </p>
      <p>Turning to FIG. 5, there is shown another two stroke engine
        having a single cylinder module. The engine is shown in partial
        cross-section. In effect, half of the engine block has been
        removed to reveal internal detail of the engine. The
        cross-section is in a plane coincident with the axis of the
        central shaft of the engine (see below). The engine block has
        thus been split at its midline. However, some engine components
        are also shown in cross-section such as pistons 62 and 63,
        bearing bosses 66 and 70, trilobate cams 60 and 61, and a sleeve
        83 associated with cam 61. All of these items will be discussed
        below. </p>
      <p>Engine 52 of FIG. 5 comprises block 53, cylinder heads 54 and
        55, and cylinders 56 and 57. A spark plug is included in each
        cylinder head but has been omitted from the drawing for clarity.
        Shaft 58 can rotate within block 53 and is supported by roller
        bearings, one of which is indicated at 59. Shaft 58 has a first
        trilobate cam 60 fixed thereto, which cam lies adjacent a
        counter rotating trilobate cam 61. Engine 52 includes a pair of
        rigidly interlinked pistons, 62 in cylinder 56 and 63 in
        cylinder 57. Pistons 62 and 63 are linked by four connecting
        rods, two of which are indicated at 64 and 65. (Connecting rods
        64 and 65 are in a different plane to the remainder of the
        cross-section of the drawing. Similarly, the points of contact
        of the connecting rods and pistons 62 and 63 are not in the same
        plane as the remainder of the cross-section. The relationship
        between connecting rods and pistons is substantially the same as
        for the engine shown in FIGS. 1 to 3.) A web 53a extends
        internally of block 53, which web includes apertures through
        which the connecting rods pass. This web retains the connecting
        rods, and hence the pistons, in alignment with the axis of the
        cylinder module. </p>
      <p>Roller bearings are interposed between the undersides of
        pistons and the camming surfaces of the trilobate cams.
        Referring to piston 62, there is mounted on the underside of the
        piston a bearing boss 66 which holds shaft 67 for roller
        bearings 68 and 69. Bearing 68 contacts cam 60 while bearing 69
        contacts cam 61. It will be appreciated that piston 63 includes
        an identical bearing boss 70 with shaft and bearings. It can
        also be appreciated from bearing boss 70 that web 53b has an
        appropriate opening to allow passage of the bearing boss. Web
        53a has a similar opening but the portion of the web shown in
        the drawing is in the same plane as connecting rods 64 and 65. </p>
      <p>Counter rotation of cam 61 with respect to cam 60 is effected
        by a differential gear train 71 mounted externally of the engine
        block. A housing 72 is provided for holding, and covering, gear
        train components. In FIG. 5, housing 72 is in cross-section
        while gear train 71 and shaft 58 are not in cross section. </p>
      <p>Gear train 71 comprises a sun gear 73 on shaft 58. Sun gear 73
        contacts drive gears 74 and 75 which in turn contact planetary
        gears 76 and 77. Planetary gears 76 and 77 are connected via
        shafts 78 and 79 to a second set of planetary gears 80 and 81,
        which intermesh with a sun gear 82 on sleeve 83. Sleeve 83 is
        coaxial with respect to shaft 58 and the distal end of the
        sleeve is fixed to cam 61. Drive gears 74 and 75 are mounted on
        shafts 84 and 85, which shafts are supported by bearings in
        housing 72. </p>
      <p>Portion of gear train 71 is shown in FIG. 6. FIG. 6 is an end
        view of shaft 58 when viewed from the bottom of the FIG. 5
        drawing. </p>
      <p>In FIG. 6, sun gear 73 can be seen about shaft 58. Drive gear
        74 is shown in contact with planetary gear 76 on shaft 78. The
        figure also shows second planetary gear 80 in contact with sun
        gear 82 on sleeve 83. </p>
      <p>It can be appreciated from FIG. 6 that clockwise rotation, for
        example, of shaft 58 and sun gear 73 will impact a
        counter-clockwise rotation on sun gear 82 and sleeve 83 via
        drive gear 74 and planetary gears 76 and 80. Hence, cams 60 and
        61 can counter rotate. </p>
      <p>Other features of the engine shown in FIG. 5, and the operating
        principle of the engine, are the same as the engine shown in
        FIGS. 1 and 2. Specifically, downward thrust of a piston imparts
        a scissor-like action on the cams which can counter rotate by
        virtue of the differental gear train. </p>
      <p>It will be appreciated that while the engine depicted in FIG. 5
        uses plain gears in the differential gear train, a bevelled gear
        train could also be employed. Similarly, plain gears can be used
        in the differential gearing arrangement shown in the FIGS. 1 and
        2 engine. </p>
      <p>In the engines exemplified in FIGS. 1 to 3, and 5, the axes of
        the roller bearings which contact the camming surfaces of the
        trilobate cams are aligned. To further improve torque
        characteristics, axes of roller bearings can be offset. </p>
      <p>An engine with offset cam contacting bearings is shown
        schematically in FIG. 7. In this figure, which is a view along
        the central shaft of an engine, cam 86, counter rotating cam 87,
        and piston 88 are shown. Piston 88 includes bearing bosses 89
        and 90 which carry roller bearings 91 and 92, which bearings are
        shown in contact with a lobe 93 and 94, respectively, of the
        trilobate cams 86 and 87. </p>
      <p>It can be appreciated from FIG. 7 that the axes 95 and 96 of
        bearings 91 and 92 are offset from each other and from the
        piston axis. Having the bearings spaced apart from the piston
        axis increases torque by increasing mechanical advantage. </p>
      <p>Detail of another piston with offset bearings on the underside
        thereof is given in FIG. 8. Piston 97 is shown with bearings 98
        and 99 carried by housings 100 and 101 on the underside of the
        piston. It can be seen here that the axes 102 and 103 of
        bearings 98 and 99 are offset but not to the degree of offset of
        the FIG. 7 bearings. It will be appreciated that the greater
        separation of the bearings as shown in FIG. 7 results in
        increased torque. </p>
      <p>While the foregoing description of particular embodiments
        applies to two-stroke engines, it will be appreciated that the
        general principles apply to two and four-stroke engines. It will
        be further appreciated that many changes and modifications can
        be made to the engines as exemplified without departing from the
        broad ambit and scope of the invention. </p>
