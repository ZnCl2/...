        <p><b>An INVENTION Made in North Yorkshire is set to Slash the
            Nation's Household Energy Bills.</b> </p>
        <p><b>By Ron Godfrey</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>Stan Whetstone, a 61-year-old inventor from Barlby, near Selby,
        has begun to market the Tadpole, his patented green device. </p>
      <p>When tagged on to existing central heating systems, it is
        claimed the Tadpole will significantly increase efficiency and
        reduce energy consumption, CO2 emissions and energy bills. </p>
      <p>Stan, the managing director of Aquastan Heating Ltd of Barlby,
        says that by fitting a £195 Tadpole to his own gas heating
        system at home, he has seen an improvement in efficiency by
        about 30 per cent over the last 12 months. </p>
      <p>And he estimates that he has slashed his household CO2
        emissions by as much as two-thirds of a tonne a year, bringing
        down his heating bills from an average of £600 per year to £420.
      </p>
      <p>The invention arrives on the market just as the government's
        Home Information Packs (HIPs) are extended to three-bedroom
        homes. </p>
      <p>The packs must include an energy performance certificate, with
        advice on how to cut carbon fuel emissions and fuel bills with
        every house sale - leading to Stan's claims that his Tadpole
        could make houses more attractive to buyers. </p>
      <p>He said: "The Tadpole works on the simplest of principles,
        improving the efficiency of heating systems by minimising the
        dissolved air which makes the water in boilers slower to heat. </p>
      <p>"With the air removed, boilers reach higher temperatures much
        faster, resulting in much less energy from gas, electric or oil
        being required. </p>
      <p>"As added benefits, The Tadpole works silently, without
        vibrations, and even reduces the need to bleed systems, as the
        oxygen which contributes to the corrosion is no longer present.
      </p>
      <p>"It can be fitted to most central heating systems which operate
        on a stored water or an immersion heater' principle, whether
        gas, electric or oil is the energy source." </p>
      <p>He calculates that if just ten per cent of the 13 million UK
        homeowners with a gas boiler heating system "tagged on a
        Tadpole" to improve efficiency by 30 per cent, the net reduction
        of CO2 emissions could be more than 1.25 million tonnes a year.
      </p>
      <p>He said: "The average household gas central heating bill of
        £700 claimed by National Energy Action could be brought to below
        £500 with the use of a Tadpole, although savings would vary
        depending on the age, size and type of heating system." </p>
      <p>Having patented the Tadpole last December, he has also run
        successful pilots of the device with a firm in Northumberland
        and at the home of a heating engineer in Nottingham. </p>
      <p>Both reported "immediate and dramatic" savings. </p>
      <p>As a result a number of distributors in East and West
        Yorkshire, the north-east and the Midlands are already supplying
        the unit. </p>

        <p><b>&nbsp;Tag on a Tadpole</b> </p>
        <p><i>As featured on Radio 2's Chris Evans Show ( 26th October
            2007 )</i></p>
      </center>
      <p>Do you have problems with your heating system? Then tadpole is
        the answer. </p>
      <p>How? Well, think about those problems. Your system is knocking
        and noisy? It's air in the system. Your radiators don't heat
        efficiently? It's air in the system. Your pipes are corroding?
        Air in the system. The radiators need bleeding constantly - air!
      </p>
      <p>The tadpole is a small, low cost, easy to fit unit - and one of
        the biggest developments in home deaeration systems. <br>
        This revolutionary new system really works! Using a very simple,
        but extremely clever, method it&nbsp; effectively removes all
        the dissolved air from the heating water. By attaching it to
        your current heating system, it enables the system to run more
        efficiently, heat up more quickly than before and allows boiler
        thermostat settings to be reduced. </p>
      <p>In addition, the tadpole will produce immediate savings in gas,
        electric or oil. And, because your heating system is protected
        from corrosion, it will significantly extend the life of your
        existing boiler. </p>
      <p>The Tadpole is the new generation of deaerators that works
        brilliantly from the very first day that it is installed, and
        for many years to come. In fact, we are so convinced that you
        will love the tadpole - we are offering a no quibble guarantee -
        if you are not happy with your tadpole, simply send it back to
        us and we will give you a full refund for the cost of puchase -
        all we ask is that it is within three months of date of
        purchase, undamaged and in its original packaging. </p>

      </center>
      <p>The tadpole is the new, landmark addition for heating systems
        that is already proving to be a huge success. That’s because it
        reduces energy consumption significantly and with minimal
        disruption to the system. </p>
      <p>What are the benefits? </p>
      <p>Existing heating systems will run more efficiently, reducing
        energy bills significantly. </p>
      <p>Tadpole reduces Carbon Dioxide emissions by up to 0.66 tonnes
        per year. If a sizeable proportion of the available market
        fitted Tadpole, in 10 years time there would be a CO2 output
        reduction of 57 million tonnes. </p>
      <p>No need to add corrosion inhibitors, in fact, the tadpole will
        ease corrosion problems. </p>
      <p>Reduces air problems in heating systems, such as ‘knocking’ and
        continual need to bleed radiators. </p>
      <p>Once installed the heating system will heat up quicker. Typical
        heat up time for a 200 litre cylinder is 36 minutes. </p>
      <p>Compact and easy to fit, the unit measures 240mm(h) x 200mm(w)
        and is available with 22mm or 28mm fittings. </p>
      <p>The system will get hotter. In fact, once installed, the
        original boiler setting may need to be reduced. </p>
      <p>The pump will run almost silently and vibration free. </p>
      <p>Reduces the problem of air entering the primary system. </p>
      <p>Who can benefit? </p>
      <p>There are 21 million heating systems in the UK that can benefit
        from the installation of Tadpole. </p>
      <p>Typical savings following the installation of a Tadpole </p>
      <p>The installation of tadpole in a heating system will reduce CO2
        emissions by an average 0.66 tonnes per house per year. If a
        sizeable proportion of the available market fitted Tadpole, in
        10 years time there would be a CO2 output reduction of 57
        million tonnes. </p>

      </center>
      <p>Circulated water contains Hydrogen and sulfated Hydrogen,
        dissolved air and other impurities, these are not the best
        components for an effective and trouble free heating system, The
        Tadpole uses a patented process (see FAQs) that ensures that the
        water is deficient in any active properties thereby making the
        installation perform in the best possible manner with the least
        waste of time using the same energy source whether it is oil,
        gas, electricity or solar power to achieve a consistently better
        output. </p>
      <p>This unique method is continuously applied to the entire
        contents of the system so that the quality of the water is
        constantly and effortlessly maintained at the highest efficiency
        rate possible. </p>
      <p>As this is fully automated it needs no mechanical intervention
        nor additional power source it does not have to be serviced nor
        does it need any external attention or future maintenance,
        never, we attest to the quality and durability of this product,
        it is quality checked to perform effortlessly for the life of
        your system and guaranteed to save you money, this is backed by

      </center>
      <p>Any reputable plumber is capable of fitting a Tadpole in
        approximately 2 hours, by following these simple instructions.
        If you have any questions please visit our Frequently Asked
        Questions page or call our helpline on 0845 072 2996. If you are
        a plumber that would like to become an approved installer,
        please email or call us today. </p>
      <p><b>Tadpole Fitting Instructions</b> </p>
      <p>1. Tadpole must be installed within the PRIMARY FLOW of a
        heating system.&nbsp; Upstream of the circulation pump and any
        "S" or "Y" plan. If there are any doubts, the installer should
        contact Tag on a Tadpole services on 0845 072 2996. </p>
      <p>2. Drain the system. It is advisable at this stage, to power
        flush the system but simple draining will suffice. </p>
      <p>3. Connect the primary flow from boiler to point (A). </p>
      <p>4. Connect the outgoing primary flow to the pump at point (B).
      </p>
      <p>5. Connect the supplied automatic air vent to point (C) at the
        top of the unit. </p>
      <p>6. Re-commission the heating system following the boiler
        manufacturer’s instructions. </p>
      <p>7. Leave the filling loop connected for at least 2 days. As
        Tadpole releases air from the system, there will be some drop in
        water level which the filing loop will replace. </p>
      <p><b>After Installation</b> </p>
      <p>1. Once the system has been checked for leaks and
        re-commissioned, heat up time should be shorter and the heating
        system should get much hotter from the same boiler setting. It
        may be advisable to reduce the setting of the main boiler
        thermostat. </p>
      <p>2. Once the system has reached set point and has been running
        for about 20 minutes, it may be noted that the circulation pump
        will be running more quietly. This is due to the reduction of
        dissolved air in the system. </p>
      <p>3. Tap water, which is the original source of the primary
        circuit, contains roughly 2.5% of dissolved air. In heating
        systems some of this air is driven out simply through a rise in
        temperature, but not all.This is why corrosion inhibitors need
        to be added, to protect the radiators from corrosion.Tadpole
        reduces the risk of system corrosion and therefore reduces the
        need to add inhibitors. </p>
      <p>4. We advise leaving the filling loop connected as when all the
        air is driven out of the system water volume reduces by
        approximately 2.5 litres. Leaving the filling loop connected for
        a couple of days will ensure that the system is 100% full and
        working at maximum efficiency. </p>

        <p><b><font size="+1">Yorkshire Inventor’s Innovation to Cut
              Household Bills and CO2 Emissions</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>With the increased efforts to reduce carbon footprints and the
        controversial HIPS now being extended to 3-bedroom homes, a
        61-year old Yorkshire inventor could be on the brink of
        something big with an innovative new ‘green gizmo’ – The
        Tadpole. Patented by Stan Whetsone of Barlby North Yorkshire,
        the Tadpole is a small unit which tags onto existing central
        heating systems to significantly increase efficiency and
        subsequently reduce energy consumption, CO2 emissions and energy
        bills. </p>
      <p>Having developed his Tadpole unit and fitted one to his own gas
        heating system, Stan has seen an improvement in efficiency by
        around 30% over the last 12 months, with an estimated knock on
        effect of reducing his household CO2 emissions by as much as two
        thirds of a tonne per year.&nbsp; Significantly, Stan’s heating
        bills have also come down from an average of £600 per year to
        £420. </p>
      <p>According to figures from OFGEM and the Centre for Sustainable
        Energy, an average household emits 3.3 tonnes of CO2 per year
        from a gas ‘space and water’ central heating system and
        improving efficiency by 30% could reduce this by almost one
        tonne per year.&nbsp; If just 10% of the 13 million UK
        homeowners with a gas boiler heating system, ‘tagged on a
        Tadpole’ to improve efficiency by 30% the net reduction of CO2
        emissions could be over 1.25 million tonnes a year! </p>
      <p>Similarly, according to National Energy Action, an average
        household has a gas central heating bill of £700 per year and
        the potential savings by fitting a Tadpole, as demonstrated by
        Stan’s own system, could bring this down by almost a third to
        under £500, although savings will vary significantly depending
        on the age, size and type of heating system. </p>
      <p>Like all the best inventions, Tadpole works on the simplest of
        principles, improving the efficiency of heating systems by
        minimising the dissolved air which makes the water in boilers
        slower to heat. With the air removed, boilers reach higher
        temperatures much faster, resulting in much less energy from
        gas, electric or oil being required. As added benefits, Tadpole
        works silently without vibrations and even reduces the need to
        bleed systems, as the oxygen which contributes to the corrosion
        is no longer present.&nbsp; Tadpole can be fitted to most
        central heating systems which operate on a stored water or an
        ‘immersion heater’ principle, whether gas, electric or oil is
        the energy source. </p>
      <p>Stan Whetstone left his 23-year career in the heating industry
        to put his innovative idea into development and The Tadpole
        technology was first patented in December 2006. Over the last 12
        months, Stan has not only been piloting his own Tadpole with
        considerable success but he already has a number of other very
        satisfied customers. J.P Westalls of Hexham fitted a Tadpole to
        a persistently problematic gas central heating system earlier
        this year and, to the delight of the customer, witnessed an
        almost immediate and dramatic improvement in efficiency with
        radiators that hadn’t been heating up at all, rapidly becoming
        hot. Similarly, Mr. Goodyear of Nottingham very quickly found it
        necessary to turn his gas heating system down by a third after
        fitting a Tadpole unit, resulting in equivalent savings on his
        bills. </p>
      <p>Based on the successes to date, a number of distributors in
        East and West Yorkshire, the North East and the Midlands are
        already supplying the unit. Consumers can also find our more
        information and buy the Tadpole unit for just £195 at
        www.tagonatadpole.com. </p>
      <p>Note to editors: -- </p>
      <p>Calculations for household CO2 emissions based on OFGEM figures
        and provided by the Centre for Sustainable Energy. Average house
        gas consumption = 20,500 kWh.&nbsp; 85% for space and water
        heating = 17,425.&nbsp; CO2 factor is 0.19kg / kWh.&nbsp;
        Average CO2 output therefore = 3,311 kg or 3.3 tonnes per
        household.&nbsp; 30% = 0.99 tonnes.&nbsp; If 10% of the 13m
        homes with gas boilers market were 30% more efficient, the
        savings would be 1,300,000 x 0.99 = 1,287,000 tonnes per year. </p>
      <p>Since fitting the Tadpole, over the last 12 months Stan
        Whetsone’s gas consumption for space and water heating has
        decreased by 30%, from 14,238 kWh to 10,952 kWh resulting in an
        equivalent reduction in CO2 emissions of 0.6 of a tonne - from
        2.7 tonnes to 2.1 tonnes per year. </p>
