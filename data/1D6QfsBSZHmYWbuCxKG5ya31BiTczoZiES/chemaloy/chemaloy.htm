      <p>Like Eugene Anderson's "CB II" alloy (which is dubiously
        claimed to catalyze the decomposition of water --- eyewitnesses
        have stated that the pieces of alloy appear to be diminished
        after the demonstrations), Chemalloy also generates
        hydrogen/oxygen gases, though catalysis has not been claimed for
        it. Chemalloy has several other unique properties, and the
        preparation has a distinct "alchemical" flavor to it. Very
        interesting stuff... </p>

      <p>Originally conceived as a soldering alloy, this patented
        substance has anti-friction properties, will aerate soil,
        improves seed germination, stimulates pant growth, will generate
        electricity, and ???? </p>
      <p>What relation there can be between soldering aluminum and
        promoting the growth of huckleberries is hard to see --- yet in
        the broadest view, scientists say, all things are in some way
        interrelated. Chemalloy, with its strangely diverse properties
        seems to support this view. </p>
      <p>Put a Chemalloy rod in plain water (Fig.1) and you have a
        battery of 0.55 volt potential that will last as long as the rod
        is kept wet, generating enough power to operate a voltmeter,
        milliameter or oscilloscope. In different liquids, voltage
        varies from almost zero for petroleum to 1.1 for certain types
        of chili sauce. </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="1chem1.jpg" height="459" width="611"></p>
      </center>
      <p>As a bearing material, Chemalloy in a solid dry state
        withstands friction without coolant or lubricant. </p>
      <p>Chemalloy powderized to about 1,000,000 particles per pound
        exhibits the same elecritical properties (Fig. 2) as the solid
        rod. Here it generates slightly more than 0.5 volt, and in
        addition decomposes the water, liberating hydrogen. </p>
      <p>This process is further examined in Fig 3. First fill three
        graduated cylinders with water, one cold, the second warm, and
        the third hot. Add equal amounts of Chemalloy to each graduated
        cylinder. Instantly, the graduated cylinder containing hot water
        liberates hydrogen (Fig. 3A). </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="1chem2.jpg" height="259" width="605"></p>
      </center>
      <p>Heat is generated by the reaction so that with the passage of a
        few minutes (Figs. 3B and C) the three graduated cylinders are
        equally warm and hydrogen production in all three is the same. </p>
      <p>One of the most significant uses of powdered Chemalloy may be
        the warming and loosening of soils that are too cold or compact
        for optimum seed generation and plant growth. The warming and
        areation of soil on a laboratory basis is shown in Fig. 4. A
        sample of dry soil is placed on top of powdered Chemalloy in a
        glass case. Note the temperature rise from 94º F. to 126º F.
        Voltage remains approximately at 0.6. </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="1chem3.jpg" height="232" width="602"></p>
      </center>
      <p>From this point on, voltage will remain constant, but soil
        temperature will decline and finally stabilize at a point a few
        degrees above the environmental temperature. The electrical
        action will continue and will generate warmth at this reduced
        magnitude. To date, the capability of Chemalloy to generate
        electricity in water has been observed for seven continuous
        years, and no limit is known. The liquid, rather than the metal
        is the substance which is consumed and must be replaced. </p>

        summarizes an experiment in seed germination as follows: </p>

      <p>The assistant superintendent supervising this experiment stated
        that the addition of Chemalloy powder resulted in speedier
        germination of seeds as well as larger percentages germinated.
        Initial growth of the plants after emergence was also more rapid
        in the case of treated seeds. </p>
      <p>For field crops, Chemalloy is applied at the rate of one to
        five pounds per acre, in the row or hill with the seeds. It is
        not broadcast over the entire field area, as this would waste
        material. It needs to be buried where it will be in contact with
        soil moisture since it is inert when dry. </p>
      <p>The peach and nectarine trees in Fig. 5 were planted in poor
        compact clay soil in El Cajon, Calif., and stands in sharp

        years to the height shown from 1-in. diameter stubs. </p>

      <p>This invention relates to welding or soldering alloysand to
        processes of making such alloys. </p>
      <p>One object of this invention is to provideawelding or soldering
        alloy which can be used to unite metal parts including aluminum
        parts, without teh necessity of employing careful cleaning
        procedure or fluxes, and without the necessity of employing the
        drastic cleaning measures or using the corrosive fluxes or
        specialized equipment previously required with aluminum welding
        or soldering processes in order to remove the tenacious oxide
        film from the surface of the aluminum. </p>
      <p>Object is to provide a welding or soldering alloy for uniting
        metal parts, including aluminum or aluminum alloy parts, which
        alloy is quickly and easily employed by merely bringing the
        aluminum or aluminum alloy parts together, heating them at their
        proposed junction by any suitable means such as a gas torch in
        order to raise them above the melting point of the welding
        alloy, and then stroking the parts at their juntion by passing a
        rod of the alloy back and forth along their juntion, whereupon
        the welding rod melts and flows by capillary attraction into and
        along the joint without previously applying a flux, uniting the
        parts tenaciously in a firm and permanent joint. </p>
      <p>Another object is to provide a welding or soldering alloy for
        uniting metal parts, including aluminum or aluminum alloy parts,
        wherein the welded area, after welding or sodlering, has a
        strength at the junction which is greater than the strength of
        the adjacent metal, so that if the parts are sibjected to
        excessive force, they will break adjacent the junction, but not
        at the junction itself, even if the welding alloy has
        approximately the same thickness at the junction of the
        adjoining aluminum or aluminum alloy parts which have been
        welded. </p>
      <p>Another object is to provide a welding or soldering alloy for
        uniting metal parts, including aluminum or aluminum alloy parts,
        which alloy has a silvery appearance at the welded junction and
        which will not rust or corrode, and which can be readily
        machined, polished, plated or painted. </p>
      <p>Another object is to provide a welding or soldering alloy for
        uniting metal parts, including aluminum or aluminum alloy parts,
        which alloy can be employed by inexperienced persons without
        special training and without the need for any of the special
        preparatory measures previously required in uniting aluminum
        parts, and not requiring welding hoods, colored glasses or
        special eye protection. </p>
      <p>Another object is to provide a welding or soldering alloy for
        uniting metal parts, including aluminum or aluminum alloy parts,
        wherein the welded area has a very fine grain structure without
        porosity, and wherein soft solder will adhere so as to enable
        the attachment of wires to aluminum or aluminum alloy parts by
        soldering the wires to the welding metal. </p>
      <p>Another object is to provide a welding or soldering alloy for
        uniting metal parts, including aluminum or aluminum alloy parts,
        where special grooving or other special preparation of the edges
        of the aluminum parts to be united is not necessary, because the
        welding alloy of the present invention penetrates throught the
        oxide film to the interior of the metal to make a strong fusion,
        and flows readily without spattering or creating lumps, and
        without the production of the fumes or odors produced when
        fluxes are used as in prior processes of uniting aluminum or
        aluminum alloy parts. </p>
      <p>Another object is to provide a process for making a welding or
        soldering alloy having the characteristics set forth in the
        preceding objects, wherein the process enables the introduction
        of chemicals into the alloy while it is in a molten state,
        without the production of dangerous explosives which have
        hitherto characterized the attempted mixing of such chemicals
        with molten metal, these chemicals giving the alloy its
        properties of penetrating through oxide layers or coatings of
        impurities and of flowing easily and naturally by capillary
        attraction into the junction between the parts to be united. </p>
      <p>Another object is to provide a process of making a welding or
        soldering alloy, as set forth in the object immediately above,
        wherein the danger of explosion in introducing the chemicals
        into the molten alloy is further reduced by the use of a layer
        of carbon, such as fine grain charcoal forming an insulating
        blanket, over the top of the molten alloy, the porous material
        containing the chemicals being placed upon this carbon layer and
        pushed through it into the molten alloy beneath it, the slag,
        after being freed from its chemicals, floating to the surface
        where it is skimmed off. </p>
      <p>Hitherto, the welding or soldering of aluminum has been a
        difficult procedure requiring specialized knowledge, skilled
        workmanship, and careful preparation of the aluminum or aluminum
        alloy parts to be welded. The tenacious film of oxide which
        adheres to the surface of aluminum or aluminum alloys, unless
        removed by careful preparation or by the use of corrosive
        fluxes, effectively prevented the obtaining of a strong welded
        junction between the parts being united. Furthermore, the fact
        that aluminum melts suddenly at 1217º F without any advance
        indication, such as discoloroation, of nearing nearing the
        melting point, has made high temperature welding procedures
        dangerous, due to the possibility of destroying the parts
        themselves by their sudden disintegration. The corrosive fluxes
        hitherto used have also caused the creation of annoying fumes
        and odors, and protective goggles, hoods or the like have been
        required because of the danger to the eyes of the welding
        material spattering or sputtering. Nevertheless, without first
        applying a flux to create a flow path, the welding or soldering
        alloy would not flow along or into the junction of the parts to
        be united. The welding alloy of the present invention, as made
        by the process of the present invention, eliminates these
        defects and accomplishes the new results and advantages set
        forth in the above-stated objects. </p>
      <p>In preparing the alloy of the present invention, the following
        metals and metal alloys are melted together in a crucible in the
        following proportions to provide the metallic ingredients: </p>
      <p>Yellow brass (30% zinc and 70% copper):&nbsp; 8 lb <br>
        Aluminum:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8 lb <br>
        40-60 solder (40% tin 60% lead):&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.5 lb <br>
        Silver (.1%) or Nickel (0.1%):&nbsp; 0.1 lb <br>
        Zinc, to make up a 100 pound batch or:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        82.3 lb </p>
      <p>The chemical ingredients are next prepared in approximately the
        following proportions, for a 100 pound batch of the above metal
        ingredients: </p>
      <p>Powdered copper slag&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.0 lb <br>
        Yellow sulphur&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.25 lb <br>
        Willow charcoal&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0.75 lb <br>
        Commercial muriatic (hydrochloric) acid&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0.50
        gallons </p>
      <p>The chemical ingredients are mixed together thoroughly and the
        acid added and stirred into the dry ingredients until a thin or
        watery paste-like mass is produced. </p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the metal ingredients in the crucible have been
        heated until they reach the temperature of approximately 1450º
        F. and a layer of fine grain powdered charcoal of approximately
        a half-inch thickness is deposited on top of the molten metal to
        form an insulating blanket. When this charcoal layer has become
        red in color, the wet mass of chemical ingredients is deposited
        entirely over the top of the charcoal blanket in a thick layer.
        Using a suitable pushing device, such as a metal rod, the
        chemical mass is forced down through the charcoal blanket into
        the molten metal mixture, a small area at a time. The charcoal
        blanket shields the remainder of the mass from explosion or
        excessive reaction. As the chemical mass is pushed into the
        molten metal mixture in the crucible, a multitude of tiny
        reactions occurs throughout it, instead of a single large
        explosion, due to the fact that the chemical particles are
        separated from one another by the porous inert slag and by the
        particles of charcoal. As each portion which has been pushed
        down into the molten mixture is absorbed into the latter,
        another portion is pushed down and so on, until each portion of
        the chemical mass or layer has been pushed through the
        insulating charcoal blanket, a small area at a time. </p>
      <p>After all of the wet chemical mass has been pushed downward
        into the molten metal mixture in the crucible, the entire
        mixture is stirred thoroughly to release all of the chemicals
        from the pores of the copper slag and to cause the tiny
        reactions and the explosions to be completed. When this has been
        done, and the slag has lost its chemical impregnations by these
        reactions and minute explosions, the slag floats to the surface
        of the molten metal mixture, along with other impurities or
        superfluous materials, these being skimmed from the surface of
        the molten mixture, leaving the latter in its finished state.
        The chemically-impregnated alloy thus formed is then poured out
        and formed into suitable shapes such as rods, bars or ingots. </p>
      <p>During the period in which the chemical ingredients are being
        pushed downward through the charcoal blanket into the molten
        metal mixture, corrosive fumes are emitted which must be
        carefully disposed of or they will discolor paint, corrode
        ferrous metals, and cause annoyance to persons in the vicinity.
        After the alloy has been made in the above manner, however, it
        may be subsequently remelted without the formation of such
        fumes. The chemically-impregnated alloy remaining after the
        process has been completed is a finely homogenized, high quality
        alloy which is easily machined, plated or painted, as desired. </p>
      <p>The present process also enables the combining of zinc and lead
        in an alloy, even though these metals are normally incompatible.
        For example, only one-half of one percent of lead in a zinc
        based die, such as is used in aircraft production, causes the
        die to crack during use, because lead will not ordinarily mix
        with zinc satisfactorily. </p>
      <p>The copper slag mentioned in the foregoing process is the waste
        slag produced in copper smelting plants, and is useful because
        of its porosity and inert characteristics. It will be obvious
        that other porous materials which are similarly inert may also
        be employed to subdivide the chemical ingredients in the above
        manner and thereby convert an otherwise dangerous single
        explosion into a multitude of tiny harmless explosions and
        reactions. </p>
      <p>The chemical ingredients thus incorporated into the metal alloy
        impart to the alloy the capability of flowing naturally and
        easily by capillary attraction when the alloy is applied to the
        junction of metal parts, such as aluminum to be united, without
        the previous use of a flux. Hitherto, it has been necessary to
        apply a flux in order to form a flux path at the junction of the
        metal parts to be united, or otherwise the welding metal does
        not flow well, and does not easily enter the junction between
        the metal parts to be united. </p>
      <p>The proportions, and indeed, the components of the metallic
        mixture are not critical and many variations may be used. In
        place of the brass, pure copper or even bronze can be employed,
        more copper giving greater strength. The nickel and silver
        components are mere traces which produce better uniting of the
        metal components with one another. The chemical components of
        the alloy enable the alloy to penetrate the oxide film on
        aluminum without wire brushing or other previous preparation and
        to penetrate the crack or other junction between the parts to be
        united and to emerge on the opposite side thereof. </p>
      <p>Proof that the chemical ingredients remain in the alloy is
        found in the fact that shavings of the alloy placed in a glass
        of ordinary tap water cause the flow of an electric current
        which may be detected by a voltmeter, milliampmeter or cathode
        ray oscilloscope when leads or electrodes connected thereto are
        inserted in the water. Moreover when the alloy particles or
        shavings have been permitted to remain in the water for several
        hours, gas bubbles will emerge from the water and form on the
        surface. Each of these bubbles explodes upon the application of
        a match, showing that <b>chemicals in the alloy shavings
          produce hydrogen and other gases when placed in water</b>. A
        still more powerful effect is obtained when salt water is used.
        Moreover, if the alloy is prepared in the form of a powder, this
        powder tends to come to the surface of the water and float
        thereon even though its specific gravity or weight is nearly
        seven times that of water. </p>
      <p>In the use of the alloy of the invnetion in soldering or
        welding metal parts, such as aluminum, the extreme and exacting
        cleaning measures employed are unnecessary. the parts to be
        united, if not already satisfactorily supported adjacent one
        another, are placed in proximity to one another at the location
        where they are to be united, and heated by any suitable means,
        to a temperature which sufficient to melt the alloy. A
        temperature of approximately 800º F at the point of weld is
        sufficient, and as this is 400º to 500º degrees lower than the
        melting point of aluminum or aluminum alloys, there is no danger
        of harming the parts if ordinary care is taken. No special
        heating equipment is necessary, as the parts may be heated
        electrically, as by a hot plate, or by the application of a
        flame, such as from a gas torch, Bunsen burner, spirit lamp or
        the like. </p>
      <p>When the parts have been so heated, a piece, such as a rod, of
        the alloy of the present invention is rubbed against the parts
        and passed to and fro along their proposed junction. Since the
        melting point of the welding alloy of the present invention is
        below 825º F, it melts and flows easily at that temperature,
        forming a silvery liquid resembling mercury. No flux is
        necessary to cause the alloy to flow, penetrate or adhere. As
        the rod is rubbed back and forth along the junction, the alloy
        melts and flows easily and naturally by capillary action into
        the junction where it quickly solidifies. At the same time, it
        attacks the oxide film on the aluminum or aluminum alloy, and
        penetrates below that film into the metal itself, so that a
        strong weld is obtained. The alloy, upon cooling, has a silvery,
        attractive appearance which blends well with the adjacent
        aluminum or aluminum alloy. It also has a very fine grain
        structure and is substantially free from porosity. </p>
      <p>The alloy of the present invention may be used either in
        soldering, brazing or welding any aluminum or zinc-based metal
        with a very high efficiency and also in uniting other metals or
        materials with varying degrees of efficiency. The welding
        handbook of the American Welding Society in effect states that
        soldering takes place below 800º F, brazing above 800º F, and
        welding at such higher temperatures where the parent metal
        itself has been disturbed and fusion has taken place. </p>
      <p>The metal parts when united by the alloy of the present
        invention, may be machined by the usual techniques and
        equipment, as the alloy machines easily and is also painted or
        plated. </p>
      <p>The use of the alloy of the present invention may be summarized
        by stating that it may be employed for (1) welding of the metal
        parts without fusion, namely soldering or brazing; (2) welding
        with fusion of the metal parts, namely use of sufficient heat to
        cause surface fusion of the metal parts to be united; and (3)
        welding with fusion of the parts to be untied, accompanied by
        capillary action, namely welding wherein the alloy flows along
        the parts and through the junction thereof without the previous
        use of a flux. </p>
      <p>The use of the alloy of the present invention for soldering,
        brazing or welding metals other than aluminum alloys, such as
        the zinc base metal mentioned above, is carried out in a similar
        manner except that the working margin of the temperature between
        the zinc in the parts to be united and the present alloy is much
        smaller since aluminum melts at the relatively high temperature
        of 1217º F, whereas zinc melts at the relatively low temperature
        of 713º F. To lower the melting temperature of the alloy of the
        present invention, therefore, the silver and nickel should be
        omitted and the proportionate amount of brass reduced, as these
        metals contribute to raising the melting point. Experiments have
        also shown that the alloy of the present invnetion may be used
        to solder, braze or weld magnesium, but considerably more care
        and vigilance is necessary because magnesium, although melting
        at about 1200º F, occasionally catches fire at about 1000º F.
        Here also, the working margin of temperature is rather small and
        consequently operations must be conducted with caution. </p>
      <p>In the process of preparing the alloy of the present invention,
        if the furnace heat is inadvertently raised to too high a
        temperature so that some of the metal ingredients start to
        volatize, particularly the zinc, the operator immediately covers
        the top of the molten metal in the crucible with a layer of
        willow charcoal, which stops the volatilization. </p>
      <p>Normally, however, the operator does not use more charcoal
        after the layer which he initially applies, and waits until this
        charcoal powder has become completely red before he attempts to
        push the chemical ingredients downward through it into the
        molten metal. In practice, if the chemical ingredients are
        forced through the charcoal blanket prematurely, that is before
        it becomes fully red, the charcoal powder will puff up in clouds
        of black smoke which is irritating to the lungs and soils the
        clothing and the surroundings. It has been found best to permit
        the charcoal to ignite and burn at the outer periphery of the
        crucible and gradually consume itself toward the center of the
        blanket, whereupon the flame disappears and the top of the
        molten metal in the crucible becomes tightly sealed with a red
        charcoal coating. </p>
      <p>To improve the free machining characteristics of the alloy, the
        proportion of solder may be increased, the machinability
        increasing as the proportion of solder is increased. Thus, in
        the formula given above, instead of 1.5 pounds of solder for a
        hundred pound batch, as much as 3 to 5 pounds of solder may be
        beneficially employed. </p>
      <p>Additional sulphur is employed occasionally if, for example, it
        is found that high melting components of the alloy are not
        properly melting, even though the temperature has been raised to
        the point where other ingredients, such as zinc, are ready to
        volatize. In that instance, the operator throws yellow sulphur
        into the portion of the crucible where the unmelted brass is
        located, whereupon a blue flame arises and increases the
        temperature in the immediate vicinity of the sulphur, causing
        the brass to melt readily. Thus, the addition of sulphur has the
        opposite effect from the addition of charcoal in that sulphur
        increases the heat or fire where charcoal puts it out or
        minimizes it. </p>
      <p>The muriatic acid may volatize, to some extent, when it
        encounters the molten metal, but it undoubtedly reacts
        chemically with the metals in the crucible to produce salts such
        as chlorides which increase the tenacity of adhesion of the
        alloy in welding or soldering, and thus render the use of a
        separate flux unnecessary. The charcoal blanket however, reduces
        the tendency of the muriatic acid to volatilize, especially if
        only small portions of the chemical ingredients are pushed
        through the charcoal layer into the molten metals at a given
        time. The copper slag of the formula, being inert and
        heat-resistant, merely serves as a vehicle or carrier or
        modulator in a manner analogous to the phenomenon of modulation
        in radio wave transmission. Thus, the alloy of the present
        invention is characterized by the presence of chemicals in
        solution with the metals, these chemicals remaining in the alloy
        upon solidification and enhancing the flow of the alloy by
        capillary action during welding without the use of a separate
        flux. </p>
      <p>The use of the alloy of the present invention enables aluminum
        to be substituted for critically scarce copper in many
        installations or applications where aluminum was previously
        considered unsatisfactory because of the difficulty of welding
        or soldering it. The present alloy may also be used to coat
        aluminum wire by a procedure analogous to "tinning" copper wire
        so that the thus coated aluminum may be soft-soldered to other
        metals. The present alloy may also be used in the form of a
        molten bath for "tinning" aluminum articles for soldering them
        or for hermetically sealing them. </p>
