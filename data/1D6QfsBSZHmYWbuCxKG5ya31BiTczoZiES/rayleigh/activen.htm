    <blockquote>
      <center><b>Lord Rayleigh // William Strutt</b></center>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In the 1930s and 40s, Lord
          Rayleigh reported to the Royal Society of London about his
          experiments with active (electrically excited) nitrogen and
          other gases. In 1940, he gave an account of his discovery of
          the anomalous energy released by active nitrogen at reduced
          pressure. He explained the anomaly in the abstract of his
          second paper published on the subject in 1940, thus:</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"The amount of energy
          collected from the gas was surprisingly large, and is
          difficult to reconcile with existing theories of the nature of
          active nitrogen. In some cases the energy was as high as 10 eV
          for every molecule of nitrogen that passed through the
          discharge. [Later research raised the energy level up to 223
          eV/mol.] This quantity of energy can with difficulty be
          accounted for by dissociation, even if it occurred to the
          extent of 100%."</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In addition, he showed that
          "pieces of sheet gold, copper, silver or platinum may be made
          red hot or even melted by exposing them to active nitrogen
          produced in a low-pressure discharge. The nitrogen gives up
          its energy to the metal, which remains unacted on... Gold was
          selected as the most active metal...."</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"The energy radiated as
          after-glow under favourable conditions is only of the order of
          10нн<sup>-3</sup> of the energy collected by the metal." This
          extra energy was about 1000 times the amount radiated by
          active nitrogen alone under the most favorable experimental
          conditions he devised.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"The after-glow consists
          chiefly of three heads of the first positive nitrogen bands.
          The maximum luminosity of the visual spectrum is at 5550, and
          the wavelengths of the bands in question and their
          luminosities in terms of this maximum are as follows:</font> </p>
      <p><u><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Colour&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Wave-length&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;







            Luminosity</font></u> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">Green 0.930</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">Yellow 5802 0.870</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">Red 6251 0.321</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"The question may be raised
          whether the 'a' system of bands have great energy in the
          infra-red... We may fairly infer [based on the work of Kichlu
          and Acharya (1929)] that the infra-red contribution is not
          important."</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Rayleigh calculated the
          "theoretical maximum for integrated nitrogen after-glow" to be
          4.82 x 10<sup>2</sup> candle-sec., and used this number as a
          standard datum for his studies. He noted:</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"Although the luminosity in
          the bulb remains visible for hours, its equivalent duration at
          the initial intensity is only about 3 seconds. The prolonged
          faint luminosity contributes very little to the total."</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Lord Rayleigh also studied
          the effects of increasing and reducing the concentration of
          nitrogen, injecting active nitrogen into inert nitrogen,
          temperature change, other gases and metals, and the
          "wall-effect".</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In 1946, Rayleigh published
          a sequel study on "The surprising amount of energy which can
          be collected from gases after the electric discharge has
          passed." In the abstract of the article, he stated:</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"A new form of experiment is
          now described... in which... a platinum strip is kept hot by
          periodic discharges... [B]y making the experiment (1) with the
          Pt exposed to the gas and (2) with the Pt protected by a thin
          glass sheath it is possible to determine what part of the
          total energy is to be attributed to catalytic action of the
          discharge products. This amount of energy was found to be very
          great. Reckoning in electron volts per molecule of gas present
          it increased rapidly as the gas pressure was lowered and at
          the lowest pressure used it rose as high as 223 eV/mol.
          Results of the same order were obtained with other gases, so
          it is not clear that the glow of active nitrogen is the
          essential condition. This great liberation of energy much
          exceeds what can be explained by dissociation of the molecules
          and single ionization of every atom which results, which would
          only afford 36 eV." (Figure 1)</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"To produce the
          electrodeless discharges, the same oil condensor was used as
          in my previous work. It was charged with an induction coil
          with a slow mercury break... An ebonite wheel with a
          conducting segment is mounted on an axle which is inclined at
          45<sup>o</sup> to the horizontal. This wheel is immersed in Hg
          and makes and breaks contact once a revolution. The Hg is
          covered with a layer of alcohol...</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"Along the axis [of the
          discharge vessel] there is stretched a Pt strip, over which a
          glass sheath can be slipped. The Pt can be heated by a current
          from a battery, and the tube is wound with a wire coil, which
          is used to excite the electrodeless discharge. When the
          discharge passes, the Pt strip gets heated, and its resistance
          increases. This is attributed partly to the direct-heating
          action of the discharge, and partly to the action of the Pt
          strip in catalyzing the discharge products (ions and
          dissociated atoms?).</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"During an experiment, the
          Pt strip is kept at an arbitrary but constant resistance of <i>R</i>
          ohms. For this purpose it is made one arm of a Wheatstone's
          bridge, and the current is adjusted to heat the strip until
          the given resistance is attained. The current (C<sub>1 </sub>amp.)






          is measured. Then the glass sheath is slipped into position,
          so as to screen the wire from dissociation products. A larger
          current (C<sub>2</sub> amp.) must now be passed to restore the
          resistance to its standard value of <i>R</i> ohms. The energy
          given up to the Pt wire by the dissociation products
          is&nbsp;&nbsp; (C<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup>-C<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup>)
          <i>Rt</i> W-sec., when <i>t</i> is the time interval in
          seconds from one discharge to the next.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"This energy is derived
          from, and therefore is contained in, the gas volume<i> v</i>
          at pressure<i> p</i> cm. of Hg.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"Thus the energy per unit
          volume reckoned as at atmospheric pressure is</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"> (C<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup>-C<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup>)
          <i>Rt</i> x 76 / W-sec./cc. <i>vp</i></font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"In a typical experiment,
          when the conditions were adjusted to get the best effect at
          the chosen pressure, C<sub>1н</sub> = 0.78 amp., C<sub>2</sub>
          = 1.73 amp., <i>R </i>= 0.470 ohm, <i>t</i> = 0.25 sec., <i>v</i>
          = 19 cc., <i>p</i> = 2.6 x 10<sup>-3</sup> cm. Hg. In this
          case the energy is 432 W-sec./cc. as at N.T.P., or 98.5
          eV/mol. of N present."</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Rayleigh calculated that the
          probable length of travel of the molecules of nitrogen, from
          the point where they received energy to central strip where
          they gave it up, to be about 1 cm. (the radius of the
          discharge vessel).</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"The duration of the
          discharge (several oscillations) was estimated... and found to
          be 3.76 x 10<sup>-6</sup> sec.. This requires the molecule
          considered to have a velocity of... 5 x 10<sup>5</sup>
          cm./sec.. Now the molecular velocity of nitrogen is 5 x 10<sup>4</sup>
          cm./sec. at 273 K. To raise it 10 times, the absolute
          temperature must be increased 100 times, i.e. to the
          temperature of the hottest stars. It seems clear, therefore,
          that a molecule could not travel fast enough to give up energy
          to the Pt strip more than once during the short duration of a
          discharge. If not, it must carry 98.5 eV at one time and it is
          not easy to see how according to current ideas how it could do
          this. The energy of dissociation of nitrogen is 7.4 (?) V, and
          this, together with the ionization of both the atoms, would
          only afford 7.4 + 2 x 14.5 V or 36 V. Considering that the
          discharge gives a band spectrum and not a line spectrum, the
          idea of complete dissociation and ionization is somewhat
          fantastic; but even if we make this assumption the difficulty
          remains.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"There appears to be no
          advantage in increasing the number of turns to the maximum,
          and close winding was inconvenient, because the coil showed a
          tendency to spark over. A coil having 26.5 turns was used in
          further experiments, as being about the useful maximum.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"The pressure was then
          varied, leaving the other conditions unaltered:</font> </p>

      </center>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"It appears, therefore, that
          the energy per molecule increases very greatly as the pressure
          is diminished.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"It was of interest to see
          whether these very large values of the energy per molecule are

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">When a minute O<sub>2</sub>
          tributary is added to the N<sub>2</sub> gas stream it takes
          longer to assert its action than the time needed to change the
          gas composition, which indicates that the effect on the O<sub>2</sub>
          tributary is on the walls of the tube. The fact that when the
          O<sub>2</sub> tributary is checked the action persists
          confirms this view. The O<sub>2</sub> modifies the glass wall
          favorably for the accumulation of active N. The restoration of
          the afterglow by a tributary O<sub>2</sub> stream is very
          marked with electrodeless discharges at 0.3 mm. An increase of
          intensity by a factor of 32 is achieved by the introduction of
          the O<sub>2</sub>. The observed phenomena are complex and not
          easy to explain. The effect of treating the vessel is
          examined. Strong preliminary heating in vacuo makes a vessel
          destroy the afterglow, Heating in N<sub>2</sub> at atmospheric
          pressure has the same effect. Heating in O<sub>2</sub> at even
          1 mm pressure restores the glow. The effects can be explained
          in terms of gas-layer formation or removal. The behavior of
          the gas away from the surface is different; in this case
          purity of N<sub>2</sub> favors the promotion of active N
          phenomena.</font> </p>

          "The ionization associated with active nitrogen"</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The ionization associated
          with afterglowing N is investigated thoroughly. The ionization
          is completely cut off if the test vessel is separated from the
          afterglow by a silica wall. The ionization is thus not
          produced by light (at least of wavelength greater than 1850
          A). No increased current is observed when the surface action
          is such as to make a testing cathode red hot. This seems to
          exclude electron emission as the cause of the ionization. The
          ionization is nearly the same when the cathode is one of the
          common metals or a surface coated with meta-phosphoric acid,
          but a copper cathode, when clean, gives a much larger effect.
          It is concluded that the surface electron emission is small
          compared with the volume ionization of the gas space. The
          number of ion pairs generated and the number of photons
          emitted per cc at various stages of a decaying glow are
          measured. The number of photons is at first greater but at
          very low intensities the number of ions probably exceeds the
          number of photons. It is considered that different mechanisms
          are involved in the two processes. The admission of inert N<sub>2</sub>
          increases the instantaneous photon emission and also the
          instantaneous ionization. Evidence is produced which points to
          the fact that the ionization process and afterglow process are
          in some measure independent. The ionization potential of the N<sub>2</sub>
          molecule (15.51 v) is such that the energy attributed to
          active N<sub>2</sub> on spectroscopic grounds, as calculated
          from the emitted band spectrum, is open to suspicion. It is
          considered that previous attempts to explain active N<sub>2</sub>
          have laid too much stress on the spectroscopic aspect and have
          ignored the question of ionization. This was previously
          considered a subordinate phenomenon, but the work here shows
          that under some conditions ionization may involve as many
          atoms as the light emission.<br>

          Ionisation Associated with Active Nitrogen, by Lord
          Rayleigh&nbsp; й 1942 The Royal Society. </b><br>
      </div>

      Abstract <br>
      In this paper the ionization associated with afterglowing nitrogen
      is examined more thoroughly than has yet been done. It is found
      that this ionization is completely cut off if the testing vessel
      is separated from the afterglow by a silica wall. The ionization
      cannot therefore be directly produced by light, at any rate within
      the range from ? 1850 to the visible. No increased current is
      observed when the surface action of the active gas is so vigorous
      as to make the testing cathode (of gold) red hot. The ionization
      is in general nearly the same when the cathode of the testing
      vessel is one of the common metals or a surface coated with
      metaphosphoric acid. Copper, however, is an exception. While the
      copper is clean it gives an effect several times larger, though
      this soon goes off, as it becomes dull by the action of the gas.
      It appears therefore that though there is some surface emission of
      electrons, it is in most cases small compared with the volume
      ionization in the gas space. Comparisons are made of the number of
      ion pairs generated, and the number of photons emitted, per cubic
      centimetre at various stages as the glow dies down. At first the
      number of photons is many times greater, but as the glow gets down
      the numbers become equal, and at intensities too low for
      convenient observation it is likely that the number of ion pairs
      may become greater than the number of photons. It is certain that
      the light emission and the ionization do not go down at the same
      rate. The latter goes down much more slowly, and gains relatively.
      The interpretation of this is discussed. It is found that the
      admission of inert nitrogen which is known to increase the
      (instantaneous) emission of photons, also increases the
      (instantaneous) ionization. It is pointed out that the ionization
      of nitrogen requires 15╖ 51 V, and the presence of this ionization
      seems to throw much doubt on the attempts to calculate the energy
      of active nitrogen from the band spectrum emitted, which suggests
      an energy of 9╖ 6 V.

            of Active Nitrogen under Varied Experimental Conditions </b></big></p>
      <p>S. K. MITRA <br>
        Abstract </p>
      <p>LORD RAYLEIGH, in a remarkable series of experiments, has
        studied photometrically the variations in the after-glow
        brightness of active nitrogen under varied experimental
        conditions. The results are of extreme importance in testing the
        various theories of active nitrogen. In the present note, some
        of these results will be considered in the light of the
        hypothesis recently proposed by me1,2, namely, that active
        nitrogen is simply the ionized nitrogen molecule in the N2+(X?)
        state produced by the discharge. If the walls of the vessel are
        suitably СconditionedТ to prevent the surface from acting as
        catalyst, the recombination of the positive ions with electrons
        proceeds mainly in the volume of the gas by a three-body
        collision process in which neutral nitrogen molecules act as the
        third body. <br>

      <p> At one time RIIitra (44) suggested that the activity of active
        nitrogen was due to the presence of Nz+ ions. This theory was
        based on analogous processes <br>
        that were thought to occur in the emissioil of the spectrum of
        the night slry, and on the very large energies transferred to
        metal foils in some experiments <br>
        made by Lord Rayleigh (54). It has since been found that the
        interpretation of the atmospheric spectrum in terms of Nz+ was
        wrong (7) and that Rayleigh's <br>
        results were due to bombardment by electrons from the exciting
        discharge (2). Mitra has therefore suggested recently (45) that
        the activity of active nitrogen <br>
        is due to nitrogen atoms...<br>

        Abstract <br>
        SPECTROSCOPIC evidence1 shows that the maximum energy of
        excitation which a molecule of active nitrogen can impart to
        another molecule (or atom) is 9.45 eV. Lord Rayleigh, however,
        from a study of the incandescence of metals immersed in active
        nitrogen, finds2 that each molecule of active nitrogen delivers
        to the metal energy of, at the least, 10 eV. These apparently
        conflicting results can be reconciled and satisfactorily
        explained on the hypothesis recently proposed by me, namely,
        that active nitrogen is simply the ionized molecule of nitrogen
        N2 + (X') produced by the discharge.<br>
