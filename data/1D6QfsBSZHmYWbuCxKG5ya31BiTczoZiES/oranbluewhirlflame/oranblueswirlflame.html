            Whirl' Fire Tornado Burns Cleaner for Reduced Emissions</b><br>

        <i>Findings could lead to cleaner oil spill cleanups</i><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      COLLEGE PARK, Md. — Fire tornados, or ‘fire whirls,’ pose a
      powerful and essentially uncontrollable threat to life, property,
      and the surrounding environment in large urban and wildland fires.
      But now, a team of researchers in the University of Maryland’s A.
      James Clark School of Engineering say their discovery of a type of
      fire tornado they call a ‘blue whirl’ could lead to beneficial new
      approaches for reducing carbon emissions and improving oil spill
      cleanup.<br>
      <br>
      A new paper published online August 4, 2016, in the peer-reviewed
      journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS)
      describes this previously unobserved flame phenomenon, which burns
      nearly soot-free.<br>
      <br>
      “Blue whirls evolve from traditional yellow fire whirls. The
      yellow color is due to radiating soot particles, which form when
      there is not enough oxygen to burn the fuel completely,” said
      Elaine Oran, Glenn L. Martin Institute Professor of Engineering
      and co-author of the paper. “Blue in the whirl indicates there is
      enough oxygen for complete combustion, which means less or no
      soot, and is therefore a cleaner burn.”<br>
      <br>
      The Clark School team initially set out to investigate the
      combustion and burning dynamics of fire whirls on water. What they
      discovered was a novel, swirling blue flame that they say could
      help meet the growing worldwide demand for high-efficiency,
      low-emission combustion.<br>
      <br>
      “A fire tornado has long been seen as this incredibly scary,
      destructive thing. But, like electricity, can you harness it for
      good? If we can understand it, then maybe we can control and use
      it,” said Michael Gollner, assistant professor of fire protection
      engineering and co-author of the paper.<br>
      <br>
      “This is the first time fire whirls have been studied for their
      practical applications,” Gollner added.<br>
      <br>
      Some oil spill remediation techniques include corralling up the
      crude oil to create a thick layer on the water surface that can be
      burned in place, but the resulting combustion is smoky,
      inefficient, and incomplete. However, the Clark School researchers
      say blue whirls could improve remediation-by-combustion approaches
      by burning the oil layer with increased efficiency, reducing
      harmful emissions into the atmosphere around it and the ocean
      beneath it.<br>
      <br>
      “Fire whirls are more efficient than other forms of combustion
      because they produce drastically increased heating to the surface
      of fuels, allowing them to burn faster and more completely. In our
      experiments over water, we’ve seen how the circulation fire whirls
      generate also helps to pull in fuels. If we can achieve a state
      akin to the blue whirl at larger scale, we can further reduce
      airborne emissions for a much cleaner means of spill cleanup,”
      explained Gollner.<br>
      <br>
      Beyond improvements to fuel efficiency and oil spill remediation,
      there are currently few easy methods to generate a stable vortex
      in the lab, so the team hopes their discovery of the ‘blue swirl’
      can serve as a natural research platform for the future study of
      vortices and vortex breakdown in fluid mechanics.<br>
      <br>
      “A fire whirl is usually turbulent, but this blue whirl is very
      quiet and stable without visible or audible signs of turbulence,”
      said Huahua Xiao, assistant research scientist in the Clark
      School's Department of Aerospace Engineering and corresponding
      author of the paper. “It’s really a very exciting discovery that
      offers important possibilities both within and outside of the
      research lab."...<br>

      <br>
      Scientists have identified a new kind of fire which burns more
      cleanly. According to a recently published study from the
      University of Maryland, or UMD, this phenomenon, called a blue
      whirl, “evolves from a fire whirl and burns with nearly soot-free
      combustion.” Fire whirls are often vertical funnels of flames that
      whip up potentially dangerous, debris-carrying winds. They also
      tend to be yellow in color because a lack of oxygen causes
      incomplete burning and the creation of soot. A blue flame, on the
      other hand, reflects “there is enough oxygen for complete
      combustion, which means less or no soot, and is therefore a
      cleaner burn.” As a UMD press release states, “The Clark School
      team initially set out to investigate the combustion and burning
      dynamics of fire whirls on water.” As they were especially
      interested in the whirls’ use in cleaning up oil spills, they
      added liquid fuel to water to create a pool fire. After
      manipulating the system upward with the help of tubes, the team
      noticed that the resulting fire whirl eventually turned into “a
      small, intensely whirling blue flame.” While additional research
      is needed to determine the applications of this discovery, it
      could potentially decrease the number of pollutants released into
      the environment during the cleanup of oil disasters.<br>

      </b><b>Significance</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The growing worldwide demand to reduce emissions from combustion
      calls for development of alternative technologies for
      high-efficiency and low-emission combustion. Whereas fire whirls
      are known for their intense and disastrous threat to life and
      surrounding environments, their swirl properties and thus higher
      combustion efficiency imply an unexploited potential for highly
      efficient, low-emission combustion. In studying fire whirls over
      water for oil-spill cleanup, we discovered a beautiful, swirling
      flame phenomenon, the “blue whirl,” which evolves from a fire
      whirl and burns with nearly soot-free combustion. Understanding
      and control of the blue whirl and its predecessor, the fire whirl,
      will suggest new ways for fuel-spill remediation,
      reduced-pollution combustion, and fluid mechanics research.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Fire whirls are powerful, spinning disasters for people and
      surroundings when they occur in large urban and wildland fires.
      Whereas fire whirls have been studied for fire-safety
      applications, previous research has yet to harness their potential
      burning efficiency for enhanced combustion. This article presents
      laboratory studies of fire whirls initiated as pool fires, but
      where the fuel sits on a water surface, suggesting the idea of
      exploiting the high efficiency of fire whirls for oil-spill
      remediation. We show the transition from a pool fire, to a fire
      whirl, and then to a previously unobserved state, a “blue whirl.”
      A blue whirl is smaller, very stable, and burns completely blue as
      a hydrocarbon flame, indicating soot-free burning. The combination
      of fast mixing, intense swirl, and the water–surface boundary
      creates the conditions leading to nearly soot-free combustion.
      With the worldwide need to reduce emissions from both wanted and
      unwanted combustion, discovery of this state points to possible
      new pathways for reduced-emission combustion and fuel-spill
      cleanup. Because current methods to generate a stable vortex are
      difficult, we also propose that the blue whirl may serve as a
      research platform for fundamental studies of vortices and vortex
      breakdown in fluid mechanics.<br>
      <br>
      Fire tornadoes, fire devils, and fire twisters are popular and
      terrifying common names for fire whirls. These intense swirling
      fires arise spontaneously with the “right” combination of wind and
      fire. On the large scale, they appear very similar to atmospheric
      phenomena such as tornadoes and dust devils (1⇓⇓–4). Fire whirls
      form in large urban and wildland fires when winds interact with
      obstacles or natural features in the terrain (2, 4⇓–6) and produce
      large vortices that intensify as they interact with a local fire.
      When fire whirls arise naturally in large fires, they present a
      strong, essentially uncontrollable threat to life, property, and
      surrounding environments. Due to the strong vertical winds they
      generate, they can lift and toss burning debris, which can then
      travel kilometers to spread the fire (5, 7).<br>
      <br>
      A pool fire is a diffusion flame that burns above a horizontal
      pool of vaporizing hydrocarbon fuel. Pool fires can occur on any
      flat surface on which fuel is spread, including in situ burning of
      oil spills (8). Fire whirls can evolve from relatively small fires
      under proper wind or topographic conditions (1, 2, 5⇓–7, 9).
      Smaller-scale laboratory experiments have shown that a relatively
      quiescent pool fire may transform into a fire whirl (2, 7,
      10⇓⇓⇓–14), and that the temperature and burning efficiency are
      higher than those of the initial fire (2, 10, 15). This transition
      occurs through a pattern of events in which the fire first leans
      to one side, begins to rotate, and then stretches upward
      (lengthens) before eventually becoming a fire whirl (7, 10, 14).
      Flame heights from wildfires, pool fires, and fire whirls range
      from centimeters to kilometers (1, 12, 14, 16, 17). Smaller-scale
      experiments may be performed in laboratories so that their
      properties and behaviors can be studied (2, 4, 6, 7, 13, 18, 19).<br>
      <br>
      <b>Blue Fire Whirl over Water</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      For the purpose of improving fuel-spill remediation, we began a
      study of swirling flames ignited and burning on water, as opposed
      to the usual solid ground. A major, obvious difference between
      this and prior studies of pool fires and fire whirls on solid
      surfaces is the physical complexity of the boundary layer between
      the water, evaporating fuel, and flame. Fig. 1 shows the three
      states of burning that we observe on water. Fig. 1 A and B shows
      the usual pool fire and fire whirl, respectively, created here
      when winds enter the chamber tangentially. Fig. 1C shows the blue
      whirl, which evolves from the yellow fire whirl and is shown and
      discussed here.<br>
      <br>

      <i>Evolution from a pool fire to a blue whirl over water in a
        swirl generator. (A) Pool fire forms following ignition. (B)
        Canonical fire whirl develops subsequent to the pool fire. (C)
        Previously unobserved laminar blue whirl evolves from the yellow
        fire whirl. The vertical scale marked on the side of each image
        starts at the water surface.</i><i><br>
      </i><br>
      The experimental setup consists of two half-cylinders and a
      cylindrical stainless steel pan full of water. A liquid fuel,
      n-heptane, is poured on the surface of quiescent water at the
      center of the pan and is then ignited by a small igniter. The two
      quartz half-cylinders are suspended over the pan. Offsetting the
      half-cylinders creates two vertical slits that allow air to be
      entrained tangentially to the flame region, a method often used to
      create fire whirls for laboratory study (18). To sustain the blue
      whirl for further observation and study, we introduced a small
      copper tube under the water to pump heptane to the center region
      of the water surface at a fixed flow rate. When the fuel injection
      rate was set between 0.8 and 1.2 mL/min, and the size of the
      vertical gaps was 1.8–3.0 cm, the blue whirl could be sustained as
      long as fuel was supplied. (The longest time sustained was just
      under 8 min, the time when the pump was stopped.) When the fuel
      supply was cut off, the blue whirl died out quietly as a blue
      whirl with ever-decreasing size, all of which indicates that it
      could, in theory, be sustained for longer times if fuel were made
      available.<br>
      <br>
      After ignition, a small, chaotic pool fire forms (Fig. 1A). As
      cold entrained air is drawn into the chamber, the fire creates a
      strong vertical flow. Initially, the pool fire tilts and meanders
      (Movie S1), as reported previously (7, 10, 14), but then a
      canonical fire whirl, over 60 cm high, forms at the center of the
      apparatus (Fig. 1B). As with fire whirls on solid surfaces, this
      fire whirl on water burns much more vigorously than the initial
      pool fire. The vortex motions are strong, the fire whirl is
      taller, and the temperature is higher than in a pool fire. Then,
      unexpectedly, the fire whirl continues to evolve to a different,
      unexpected fire structure (Fig. 1C): a small, intensely whirling
      blue flame (Movies S1 and S2).<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      Transition from pool fire to yellow and blue whirls with fixed
      initial fuel (heptane) layer. This representative movie shows the
      transition from a pool fire to a blue whirl and the evolution of
      the blue whirl during liquid hydrocarbon fuel burning over water.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      Burning of blue whirls over water with fuel injection at a
      constant flow rate. This representative movie shows two different
      burning processes and a close-up of blue whirls: (i) burning of a
      stable blue whirl, (ii) transition between blue and yellow whirls
      during blue whirl burning shown at regular and reduced speeds, and
      (iii) close-up of blue whirl structure and motion at regular and
      reduced speeds.<br>
      <br>
      Whereas the pool fire and the fire whirl are turbulent, the blue
      whirl shows no visible or aural signs of turbulence. A stable blue
      whirl is very quiet. The rotation was generally clockwise,
      consistent with the direction of air inflow from the gaps in the
      apparatus. Throughout its lifetime, the blue whirl generally
      revolves clockwise in the center region of the container at an
      angular speed within 6.3 rad/s.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Structure of the Blue Whirl</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Fig. 2 shows a front view of the structure of a blue whirl. This
      structure consists of two main regions: the bright-blue spinning
      flame at the base and a faint conical violet flame sitting above
      and (possibly) partly in the central cup. The lower blue region
      appears more stable and ∼2 cm high. The height of the visible
      violet region varies from 2 to 6 cm. Thus, the total height of the
      blue whirl was 4–8 cm, much shorter than the yellow fire whirl
      (over 60 cm) or pool fire (typically around 25 cm for this
      system). Near the fuel surface, the blue whirl tapers to a small
      rounded bottom. Above the bottom point, the blue whirl spreads out
      as it moves upward and resembles a spinning top. There is often a
      gap between the water and the bottom of the blue whirl. The top of
      the blue whirl ends sharply, although there is a hazy violet flame
      above it. At the end of burning, the blue whirl decreases in
      height and diameter and dies out calmly and smoothly (Movie S1).
      Attempts to relight residual fuel that might be on the water
      surface do not produce any flames.<br>

      <b>Transitions Between Yellow and Blue Whirls</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Once the yellow fire whirl has formed and burned for a time, it
      evolves into a transitional state with a diameter and height that
      fluctuate, but generally decrease (Movie S1). Eventually it forms
      a smaller “transitional whirl,” which appears unstable and “dances
      around” on the surface. There is a blue section at the base and a
      yellow flame that seems to grow out of this base, so that the blue
      whirl looks like a cup holding a yellow flame. A photograph of
      this transition state is shown in Fig. 3. After this, the yellow
      flame dies out, leaving only a blue whirl.<br>
      <br>

      <i>Transitioning whirl during the evolution process from a yellow

        about 15 cm. A cup-like blue whirling flame on water holds a
        yellow whirling flame.</i><i><br>
      </i><br>
      During the lifetime of the blue whirl, it transitions several
      times from the short-lived transitional whirl and then back to the
      more stable blue whirl (Fig. 4 and Movies S1 and S2). In the
      transition process, the upper region is replaced by a yellow
      flame, as shown in Fig. 4 C–O. Then, a blue cup forms again and
      holds the yellow flame in its center (Fig. 4 P and Q).
      Subsequently, the yellow flame spirally shrinks in the blue cup
      and disappears in the center region of the blue whirl (Fig. 4
      R–Y), leaving a fully recovered blue whirl. As this is happening,
      a yellow spiral flame is enclosed in an envelope composed of a
      blue whirl and a secondary violet, conical flame (Fig. 4 R–V).<br>

      <b>Understanding the Physics of the Blue Whirl</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Vortex-breakdown phenomena, which have been studied extensively in
      fluid dynamics [see, e.g., reviews in refs. 20⇓–22 and
      underpinning studies, such as by Taylor (23)], can be defined as a
      collection of properties and dynamics of a column of fluid (gas or
      liquid) subjected to various swirl intensities. These studies
      focus especially on metastable states that evolve as a result of
      the formation of stagnation points and recirculation regions.
      These phenomena are often studied confined in tubes in the
      laboratory, as well as by theory and simulations (e.g., refs.
      20⇓–22); however, they have also appeared naturally in unconfined
      scenarios, such as tornadoes (24). Two of the most important
      states of vortex breakdown are the spiral and the bubble modes. As
      the swirl strength in the spiral mode increases, there may be a
      transition to a bubble mode, and there may also be transitions
      back and forth occurring among modes. Vortex breakdown is
      fundamental to swirl combustion, a spiral mode that operates so
      efficiently because of turbulent mixing and the recirculation
      zones that result in the increased residence times required for
      favorable combustion properties (25⇓–27).<br>
      <br>
      The fluid-dynamic starting point for understanding the blue whirl
      is to make a visually based, as yet qualitative analogy. Fire
      whirls appear to be versions of a spiral mode. The lower blue
      region of the blue whirl appears to be the lower portion of a
      bubble mode, with the upper portion of the bubble completed by the
      blue whirl’s purple cap. Such a configuration occurring naturally
      with combustion, to the best knowledge of the authors, has not
      been observed before. The blue whirl also has a shape similar to
      that seen in tornadoes (24), and so it may correspond to a
      reactive bubble mode. We therefore postulate that the blue-whirl
      bubble evolves when the traditional yellow fire whirl, existing in
      a spiral-like mode, intensifies naturally. This is a starting
      point for explaining some of the transition process observed (Fig.
      4).<br>
      <br>
      The yellow color of hydrocarbon diffusion flames, such as pool
      fires or fire whirls, is due to blackbody emissions by radiating
      soot particles. Soot forms when there is not enough oxygen present
      to burn the fuel completely. The blue and violet colors are due to
      chemiluminescence of excited species such as C2, CH, and OH
      radicals (28, 29). Blue in the whirl indicates that there is
      enough oxygen present for complete combustion, and therefore
      suggests a premixed flame. Previous work has shown that fast
      mixing, which occurs in certain coflowing or opposed-jet diffusion
      flames, can create soot-free, blue flames (30⇓–32). The
      explanation was that the fluid dynamics around the flame helped
      limit soot precursors and soot in fuel-rich regions, so that
      complete oxidation occurred in fuel-lean regions (31⇓–33). Similar
      processes occurring in recirculation zones inside the blue whirl
      could limit the soot formation here.<br>
      <br>
      Furthermore, we speculate that the boundary conditions, that is,
      the existence of an air–water–fuel boundary layer instead of a
      fuel–air boundary on a solid surface, plays an important role for
      the transition to a blue whirl. For a fire whirl on a solid
      surface, there is a flame vortex tube that ends on the solid
      surface. On water, the flame appears to sit above the surface and
      even generates vortical motions in and on the water. There is
      likely to be a layer of evaporated fuel between the bottom of the
      blue whirl and the water, possibly creating a premixed region at
      the base. On the other hand, flow rotation intensifies air
      entrainment and causes strong inflow of air near the boundary
      layer in vortex phenomena (2, 3, 7, 10), which could allow
      reactants to mix quickly above the fuel surface. This would have
      the general form of a triple flame (34), a small premixed flame
      connected to a diffusion flame. This may also result in higher
      temperatures and thus increased burning efficiencies.<br>
      <br>
      Fuel rotation induced by the spinning helps the blue whirl stay
      centered in the tank. The strong rotation lowers the pressure in
      the center of the vortex, thus keeping the fuel slick from
      spreading as it does in pool fires. This helps the blue whirl to
      burn for extended periods, sometimes removing any visible residual
      fuel slick. This may be useful for in situ burning, because an oil
      slick must be maintained with a critical thickness or the fire
      will burn out (35).<br>
      <br>
      In conclusion, experiments have discovered a flame phenomenon, the
      blue whirl, which shows a distinct flame structure and reduced
      soot emissions compared with both traditional pool fires and fire
      whirls. These changes are thought to occur through a combination
      of a vortex breakdown transition, in which the flow transitions
      from a spiral to a bubble mode, and by fast mixing, which limits
      soot formation in the vortex and creates regions of premixed fuel
      and oxidizer. Many questions still remain, such as why has this
      blue whirl not been seen before, what really are the physical and
      chemical processes controlling the formation of the blue whirl,
      can this configuration be used for energy production, and can we
      generate blue whirls at larger scales? Further understanding of
      the complex, multiphase physics occurring during blue-whirl
      combustion offers exciting possibilities for the future, and may
      therefore lead to the development of novel methods for fuel-spill
      remediation and high-efficiency combustion. <br>

      <b>Materials and Methods</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The experimental setup is shown in Fig. 5. The experiment was
      performed on top of a round steel pan filled with water, with a
      40-cm inner diameter and 3.2 cm in height. The water surface was
      flush with the edge of the water pan. Two quartz half-cylinders
      (30 cm in diameter and 60 cm in height) were suspended about 2 mm
      over the water surface (Note that the blue whirl can form when the
      bottoms of the half-cylinders fully or partly touch the water
      surface.) The ambient pressure and temperature in the experiments
      were 1 atm and 298 K, respectively. The liquid fuel used was 99.4%
      pure liquid n-heptane. Initially, the water was quiescent and 2.5
      mL heptane was squirted from a syringe onto the center region of
      the water surface. Shortly thereafter, the heptane was ignited by
      a small igniter filled with butane (Olympian GM-3X) which was
      removed immediately after ignition. The gap size between the
      half-cylinders and the initial amount of liquid n-heptane poured
      on the water was initially varied, but the observations reported
      here were all taken at 1.8 cm and 2.5 mL, respectively.<br>

      <i>Experimental design of the fire whirl generator over water. The
        copper fuel pump tube, which is connected to a syringe pump, is
        removable.</i><i><br>
      </i><br>
      To sustain the blue whirl for extended observation, a syringe (BD
      60-mL syringe) was first filled with heptane and then injected
      slowly to the center region of the water surface through a copper
      tube (external and internal diameters 0.3 and 0.1 cm,
      respectively). The copper tube was extended along the bottom of
      the water pan to the center and bent vertically upward until its
      opening was about 3 mm below the water surface. A small needle was
      projected out of the tube opening with its tip just under the
      water surface to prevent bubble formation when feeding heptane.
      The copper tube was connected to the syringe using a rubber tube
      outside the water pan. Injection of fuel was controlled by a
      syringe pump (Harvard Apparatus Pump 11 Elite) that continually
      supplied heptane at a constant rate (1.1 mL/min in this study).<br>
      <br>
      Changing the exterior shape of the confining apparatus does not
      seem to affect whether or not fire whirls or blue whirls can form.
      Experiments in a four-sided square polymethyl methacrylate
      apparatus produced a fire whirl evolving into a blue whirl. The
      gap size of the slits between the two half-cylinders, however,
      does affect the formation and stability of both the blue and
      traditional fire whirls. Ultimately, a two-gap configuration with
      a cylindrical shape was chosen for the study in the belief that
      the cylindrical shape would allow the blue whirl to form and
      remain stable in the center region of the apparatus. An important
      point to make is that the blue whirl formed not only when
      n-heptane was the fuel, but also formed with heavier hydrocarbons,
      such as crude oil.<br>
      <br>
      The evolution of the fire and fire whirls was recorded using a
      Canon EOS 70D digital single-lens reflex camera. The images in
      Fig. 1 A and B were taken using a Tv mode with manual focusing and
      automatic ISO sensitivity. The images in Figs. 1C, 2, and 3 were
      taken using Scene mode with manual focusing. The images taken by
      the camera in Figs. 1–3 were acquired with a pixel resolution of
      3,648 × 3,432 and bit depth of 24. The movie from which Fig. 4 was
      extracted, and Movies S1 and S2 were taken at a frame rate of 50
      frames per second with a pixel resolution of 1,280 × 720.<br>
