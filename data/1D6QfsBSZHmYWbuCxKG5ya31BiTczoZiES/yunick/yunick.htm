        <p><b><font size="+1">Smokey’s New Hot Vapourizing Engine
              Creates Heat in Detroit</font></b> </p>
        <p><b>By Brad Dennis</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>What engine is smother than an electric motor, meets all
        emission standards without electronic equipment, produces 2
        horsepower per cubic inch of engine, can deliver 60 miles per
        gallon and weighs only 170 pounds? </p>
      <p>Well, it’s the development by a researcher I’ve written about
        in previous articles – Smokey Yunick. </p>
      <p>This article updates the status of Smokey’s Hot Vapor Fuel
        System. That right: hot vapor fuel. I’ve hammered at this theory
        in a number of articles for over two years. </p>
      <p>This little motor really is a GM V-6 engine block cut down to a
        V-2 cylinder. It’s turbocharged and feeds hot air and vaporized
        fuel to its cylinders. One of the most unique aspects of this
        design, as well as having GM engineers talking to themselves, is
        that this hot vapor system operates so there’s no detonation. </p>
      <p>The first thing that strikes you about this engine is its size.
        “Seventy-eight cubic inches and 170 pounds”, says Smokey.
        Another surprising thing: There’s no cooling fan. In fact, there
        are only two quarts of water in the entire system, including the
        tiny radiator. </p>
      <p>Smokey calls it his “Phase I adiabatic engine”. Adiabatic is an
        engineering term that refers to any process in which there’s no
        gain nor loss of heat. </p>
      <p>A completely adiabatic engine isn’t possible, but the closer
        you get, the higher the engine’s efficiency and the better the
        fuel mileage. In other words, the less heat energy generated by
        the burning fuel that you throw away through the exhaust and
        cooling systems (much like the vehicles we all drive today), the
        more energy there’s available to move the car. </p>
      <p><b>The Secret is in the Plumbing</b> </p>
      <p>Despite its obviously sophisticated makeup, the engine is
        surprisingly simple. Don’t look for exotic materials, novel
        mechanical linkages or unique structures. You won’t find them. </p>
      <p>Although the experimental engine is hand-welded from aluminum,
        that isn’t the way a production unit would be made. </p>
      <p>The accessories, including the carburetor, are mostly pickups
        from around his shop. There are no electronic devices. Smokey
        prefers to avoid them. So, his engines run with simple
        carburetor and breaker points. Yet, the system fully meets all
        emission standards. Consequently, manufacturers could eliminate
        all those expensive, ridiculous converters and air pumps. </p>
      <p>The secret of the engine’s remarkable performance is its unique
        three-stage heat recovery system, which accounts for the
        strange-looking plumbing. </p>
      <p>In essence, Smokey uses part of what would be waste heat in a
        conventional engine to preheat the air-fuel mixture before it
        reaches the cylinders for combustion. </p>
      <p>To understand how this system works, follow Figure 1 through
        the cooling jacket lines to a boxlike structure under the
        carburetor (this device is just a heat exchanger). Smokey calls
        this the first-stage vapor generator. All the air-fuel mix from
        the carburetor passes through it and is heated to over 200
        degrees F. This increases fuel vaporization for much smoother
        systems. </p>
      <p>At this point, Smokey begins to cut across the grain of
        accepted induction and combustion theory, or at least now he’s
        writing a new chapter: Remember, normally, intake charge
        temperatures rarely exceed 130 F. </p>
      <p>Smokey’s innovation has a slightly different twist than most
        vapor carburetion designs. He incorporates a small turbocharger
        which he calls a homogenizer. The compressor side of this unit
        is jacketed with a metal envelope. A pipe from the exhaust
        system vents hot gases into the envelope. This heats the intake
        charge even further. </p>
      <p>Smokey’s engine introduces a hot charge into the chamber, so
        there’s less chance for the mixture in contact with the walls to
        cool below its burn temperature. </p>
      <p>The third and final preheating takes place in the intake
        manifold. Smokey describes it as “a shell over a shell, a heat
        exchanger or a superheater”. </p>
      <p>By the time the mi passes through the heated manifold, its
        temperature has reached 440 F. </p>
      <p>Smokey explains the second function of the homogenizer this
        way: “When the intake mix confronts this high temperature, it
        begins to expand. The tendency without the homogenizer would be
        to back out of the carburateor. It’s the homogenizer’s job to
        hold about half a pound of pressure on the manifold. It acts as
        a one-way valve”. </p>
      <p>Smokey describes his tests with fuel vaporization: “On the flow
        bench and on the dynamometer, we’d pull out a sample of air-fuel
        mixture mixed by the standard carburetor, and you couldn’t punch
        a stopwatch fast enough before the mixture started to separate
        into a liquid and air again. But, when the mixture goes through
        the entire heated process and then through the homogenizer, it’s
        20 minutes before it starts to settle out”. </p>
      <p>This is the reason why heated vaporizing systems produce a
        drastic reduction in unburned hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide,
        which are the two major emission problems in autos. They are
        caused primarily by two things: charge stratification and
        surface quenching. </p>
      <p>Stratification occurs when the fuel mixture separates into two
        distinct lean and rich combinations or layers. The homogenizer
        prevents this by creating a uniform concentration of fuel in the
        charge. </p>
      <p>Surface quenching occurs because the temperature of the
        combustion chamber wall is lower than that required for
        combustion. This cools the mixture in contact with the surface
        below its burn temperature. Thus, combustion remains incomplete
        and the unburned hydrocarbons are expelled with the spent gases.
      </p>
      <p>What everyone, including the major car engineers, would like to
        know is why Smokey’s engine doesn’t destroy itself with abnormal
        combustion or detonation. </p>
      <p>Detonation occurs when either the temperature or the pressure
        in a combustion chamber is too high. Inside the hot chamber
        reactions become so rapid that uncontrolled, often destructive,
        combustion begins to occur in parts of the chamber rather than
        smooth, progressive burning. These rapid reactions produce
        high-frequency pressure waves that beat against the combustion
        chamber walls, causing the vibrations we know as knock or ping.
      </p>
      <p>The high-temperature mixture in Smokey’s engine should cause
        severe and damaging detonation. The only way to reduce this
        condition would be to reduce the temperature and/or pressure, or
        at least use a higher octane fuel. </p>
      <p>At least this is the only way we’ve ever been trained to think.
        That’s right! We’ve been led down a narrow path of engineering
        expertise, without being allowed to design other methods simply
        because the engineering manuals say, “That’s not possible”.
        Smokey defies commonly accepted thermodynamic theory by adding
        heat, pressurizing and running on regular unleaded gasoline, and
        his engine won’t detonate. The engineers from Detroit are
        confused about why this motor won’t detonate. It’s quite simple:
        If the air and fuel are both heated and thoroughly vaporized
        into a homogeneously heated mixture, there can be no dissociated
        liquid fuel particles; hence no detonation. </p>
      <p>In its simplest form, if the fuel is in a true vapor state and
        can be held that way before combustion, there can be no
        detonation. The fuel in a true vapor state has a much higher
        resistance to ping, while still using a low grade of fuel. </p>
      <p>Smokey’s contradiction of all conventional theories on
        detonation and fuel behavior have stirred enough excitement to
        bring top executives and engineers from Ford, GM and Chrysler,
        as well as from several foreign builders. Most of the top-level
        executives from the big three have driven the car with Smokey’s
        hot vapor engine and, since some of the test drives, there have
        been checks for as much as $200,00 for short-term options on the
        design. </p>
      <p>Smokey’s problem with these contracts was the unwillingness of
        interested companies to… [ page 31 missing ] </p>

      <p>This page is a translation from the Swedish "Hot Rod Magazine".
        It was published 1984. The article was in two parts. The first
        described the story about Smokey Yunick and what he had done in
        the past. The second article described the Hot Vapor Cycle
        Engine. The author of the article was Anders "Bostic" Envall and
        the photographer was Anders Albinsson. The translation from
        sweedish to english was made by Hans Schou in april 2002. </p>
      <p>Henry (Harry, Gregory) "Smokey" Yunick was born on May 25, 1923
        in the Maryville area, Tennessee. Died in May 2001. </p>
      <p>"I worked on my motorcycle and I was racing on a half-mile
        track. I didn't do a very good job as it was smoking like a SOB.
        The guy had forgotten my name, so when I got to doing pretty
        good he started calling me 'Smokey'. One of the guys I worked
        with was there when he called me Smokey. When I got to work the
        next day, he kept calling me Smokey. Before you knew it
        everybody was calling me that. The nickname stuck." -- Smokey
        Yunick </p>
      <p>From: Tad Barteau </p>
      <p>Mr. Unick built a small v-twin four cycle engine that was
        conventional except for the addition ot three devices that were
        known, understood and unpatentable. At the time he was trying to
        patent the new techinque of using these three devices together
        and only described two of them in the article for the sake of
        security. </p>

      <p>I asked Smokey about the adiabatic engine that we all know
        about and he replied, "The adiabatic engine is parked, 'cept the
        U S Army looked at it in April '98. I doubt much will come out
        of those meetings." </p>

      <p>Did you happen to hear about "Smokey" Henry Yunick's adiabatic
        engine? He holds several patents related to the article I saw in
        the April 1983 issue of Popular Science. He managed to get 150
        Hp and 60 MPG out of a 78 ci. 2 cyl motor. The article even goes
        on to say that one of the "detroit boys" were donating a car
        (chassis) to him for testing. Of course you've never heard about
        this since. Check out patent #4,862,859 and his related patents.

        "homogenizer." Actually, it is a low-pressure turbocharger
        installed in the intake manifold just after the carburetor. In
        essence, the "homogenizer" is one of the components in his
        design of an adiabatic engine. Although it may have been able to
        pass the emissions tests in its day (1983), it probably could
        not do so today. </p>

      <p>From: TMatthe@aol.com </p>
      <p>I met Smokey Yunick at a seminar at Charlotte Motor Speedway in
        88 or so and asked him about this project; the engine he used
        was a Mopar 2.2, and the engine had one fundamental problem- he
        said that there was no oil that would last for a satisfactory
        length of time in operation except for mil-spec jet engine oil,
        which he said was $98 a quart at the time. I haven't heard
        anything about this project since then. </p>

        <p><b><font size="+1">Half as big, Double as good -- Smokey's
              impossible engine.</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>Img1: Ah, Bostic and Benson, Welcome! After three decennier(?)
        Smokey Yunick opens his secret door. He is ready with his
        livsverk(?) and world patent at the same time. Behind this door
        the automotive industry will see a change of the future... </p>
      <p>The legendaric Smokey Yunick is not just a world champ in
        fusktrim(?) He is also genious. The best prove so far is called
        the "Hot Vapor". A new engine which will revolutionize the hole
        automotive industry. Smokey's self constructed 2 cylinder engine
        gives the double horsepower as a standard 4 cylinder engine of
        the same size. Further more is uses much less fuel and exhaust
        much less polution. Hot Vapor is almost too good to be true. But
        an enthusiastic Bostic is convinsed. It is true! </p>
      <p>Img2: ...here is all the cooling water guided through to heat
        up the fuel mixture at the same time as the water looses its
        heat... Smokey Yunick is in a bestående(?) adiabetic period.
        Some levels above all other people as usual. </p>
      <p>Img3: The fine thing about the Hot Vapor engine is that is a
        conventional construction. We find normal components even that
        the most of them has been fitted extreme påfretsningarna(?). The
        idea is that one should be able to convert a standard engine to
        Hot Vapor! But Smokey mostly like the 2 cylindred, which is a
        modified Buick V6. </p>
      <p>Think about this: Your friend has a frän(?) Golf GTI. Ou-ou.
        110 horses 4 cylinder. 0-100 km/t in 10 seconds and a fuel usage
        in about 0.70 l/milon the high way. Your friend is happy. </p>
      <p>Ready? </p>
      <p>You have also a Golf. A 2 cylinder with 150 horses! 0-100 in 9
        seconds. Fuel consumption? Yes, unbeliveable 0.39 l/mil. Mixed
        driving!! You are more happy than your friend. </p>
      <p>Fantasy? Misspelled? Ciffor-fitting? </p>
      <p>No, no, no! Welcome to the future. Today! </p>
      <p>Welcome in the back of Smokey Yunicks "Best damn garage in
        town", Daytona beach, Florida. Things happened here... </p>
      <p>After 32 years of work the project is ready. Smokeys
        livsverk(?). World premier. World patent. </p>
      <p>Hot Vapor Cycle Engine. A new engine... Prototypes has been
        running in 18 months in different cars including "your" Golf.
        The result is amazing. </p>
      <p>Compared with well known engine types the Hot Vapor has an
        almost impossible combination of properties: </p>
      <p>* Less number of cylinders <br>
        * More horsepower <br>
        * More torque <br>
        * More clean combustion <br>
        * Less fuel consumption </p>
      <p>What to say about this equation? </p>
      <p>As Smokey is the father of the Hot Vapor engine, we have to
        make one thing clear: The engine is not constructed with racing
        in mind. </p>
      <p>Not yet as Smokey says which implies that we should not be
        chocked the day the hat and boots shows up at Indy 500 with a
        tuned Hot Vapor.... V2? V4? V6? </p>
      <p>No, this can result in more significant changes than the result
        list at Indy. This can result in a change in the hole automotive
        industry in the world. Will we go to move around in cars,
        trucks, MCs, boats etc. powered by Smokey Yunicks patent in the
        future? This is the idea behind it all. </p>
      <p><b>No loss</b> </p>
      <p>If we should start on a soft track and try to describe how this
        new engine works. Not easy, kept in mind that only two persons
        knows about it. Smokey and his right hand svenskättade(?) Ralph
        Johnson is reserved for the important details until they really
        got the world patent. Such things take time. </p>
      <p>The theory have actually been known for long by engineers all
        over the world and we should keep in mind that thousands of
        engineers have tried to build this engine. All have failed.
        Besides Smokey. </p>
      <p>He actually calls the project "Phase 1 adiabatic engine". </p>
      <p>"Adiabatic" is a technical term which describes the process
        where there is neither a gain or loss of heat. </p>
      <p>A full adiabatic engine is not possible but the more heat which
        can be used during the process the more effective the engine
        becomes. In all aspects. </p>
      <p>Most of todays engines uses only 25% of the potential heat
        energy in fuel. The other 75% is just lost in exhaust, cooling
        etc. This is just what have retat(?) Smokey and all other
        engineers. To be able to use more heat energy have been the
        target. Heat is the keyword. </p>
      <p>The engine construction is traditional. We find a engine block,
        crankshaft, stakar(?), pistons, top block, camshaft, inlet,
        exhaust, etc. The good old components are here, despite fitted
        for the Hot Vapor. The fact is that one should be able to
        convert a normal engine to this Hot Vapor version. </p>
      <p>Besides building a 1-, 2- and 3-cylinder himself, Smokey has
        successfully converted existing 4-cylinder engines. See table. <br>

      <p>The thing which makes the difference between a Hot Vapor and a
        normal engine is by first view an advanced pipe system. It is
        just in this pipe system everything happens. Here happens what
        have given the project its name: "Hot Vapor". Here happens the
        heat förångningen(?) of the fuel and air mixture. The trick! To
        heat up the fuel. It happens in three steps. </p>
      <p><b>In hot air</b> </p>
      <p>On the wall in Smokeys office is an exploded drawing of the 2
        cylinder engine which is placed in the Golf. We take that engine
        as example. Smokey takes his glasses from his hat and put them
        on his nose and starts pointing and talking... </p>
      <p>It should not work with any fuel injection it is very important
        with a caburator to hinna(?) prepare the mixture properly. he
        explains. Here happens the first heating says Smokey and points
        at a box below the caburator which omslutar(?) first part of the
        inlet pipe. </p>
      <p>All water in the cooling system is forced through this box. All
        water is just 2 liter inclusive the radiator(?). There is no fan
        at all. Adiabatic... When the mixture has passed the box and is
        heated up to 90° Cit comes to the second step. </p>
      <p>The homogenizer says Smokey and points at an exhaust turbin
        wheel which is connected to an inlet turbin wheel. Aha, like a
        turbo, yes? I nod to the cowboy hat so he will think that I can
        follow him. Smart guy and so on. No! Not turbo! he says a little
        offended. A homogenizer it should be. The purpose of the
        homogenizer is to fully atomized the fuel air mixture to an
        extreme fine vapor. Otherwise it would be impossible to futher
        heat up the mixture. When the mixture has passed the turbin
        wheel it is more heated. Partly because of the friction and
        partly because the homogenizer is incapsulated in the exhaust
        system. The mixture is now 140° C. </p>
      <p>Next step is the inlet system which is totally incapsulated in
        the exhaust system. Here the mixture gets heated up to 230° C!
        Now things starts to happend. </p>
      <p>Here it expands like hell Smokey explains and thinks that the
        fuel vapor expands a lot at this temperature. Exactly as we want
        to. Ofcourse. Here the homogenizer has a futher role: to be a
        back valve, to hold back the pressure which comes from the
        expanded fuel mixture. Without this back valve the top will be
        thrown to Orlando... well.. Besides the homogenizer presses with
        0.45 kg. When the mixture reaches the combustion chamber more
        than 25% of the energy "is ready to go" (230° C). And with full
        compression, before ignition, the mixture has reached the
        extreme 820° C. After this comes the spark. </p>
      <p>You see says Smokey, what forces the piston down is not the
        heat, it is the pressure... Because of the heat I hopefully
        reply (to win back some valuable points). Thats right says
        Smokey and put the glasses on his hat and go sit in his chair.
        The boots is naturly on the table. Thats about the story he says
        and light his pibe. </p>
      <p><b>Smokeys secret</b> </p>
      <p>There is something missing in Smokeys Hot Vapor engine.
        Actually the engine should destroy it self. Most people knows
        that too high temperature in the combustion chamber will let to
        spikes(?) (uncontrolled self ignition in the combustion chamber)
        if not the fuel has the highest octane class. But with those
        figures Smokey forces up in the combustion chamber, no fuel in
        the world would be able to save the engine. At all. </p>
      <p>Even though it runs good on unleaded regular gas. Not a single
        spike! Be welcome, you are free to guess. Because here is Smokey
        like mummie. The solution to this problem is the keyword to the
        patent. Real secret. </p>
      <p>It is really quite simple, and I am carefull not saying too
        much. This is the only way I can be sure nobody knows how the
        system exactly works says Smokey who not just get visitors from
        sneaking news papers. </p>
      <p>GM, Ford, Chrysler and many foreign car manufactors comes
        around in "Best damn garage in town". To stress test Smokeys
        test cars with the new engine. It is the best engineers from the
        manufators who show up andd they come several times. Smokey is
        laughin. They come back because they can not get the engine to
        spike. Some of them does everything to get the engine spiking.
        No one has succeseeded. </p>
      <p>A technician drove about 30 km/t in highest gear and suddently
        pressed the throttle. The only thing which happend was that he
        drove from everything that day. </p>
      <p>Some of them turn of the engine and starst again and gives full
        throttle. Wheel spin. Others just get speed champs at the high
        way in hunt for spikes. </p>

      <p>Henry "Smokey" Yunick (born May 25, 1923, Neshaminy,
        Pennsylvania, died May 9, 2001 of leukemia) was a mechanic and
        car designer associated with motorsports in the United States. </p>
      <p>Yunick was deeply involved in the early years of the NASCAR,
        and he is probably most associated with that racing genre. He
        participated as a racer, designer, and other jobs relating to
        the sport but was best-known as a mechanic, builder, and crew
        chief. He was renowned as a crotchety, crusty, opinionated
        character who "was about as good as there ever was on engines,"
        according to Marvin Panch, who drove stock cars for Yunick and
        won the 1961 Daytona 500. His trademark white uniform and
        battered cowboy hat, together with a cigar or corncob pipe, were
        a familiar sight in the pits of almost every NASCAR or
        Indianapolis 500 race for over twenty years. In 1990 he was
        inducted into the International Motorsports Hall of Fame. </p>
      <p><b>Early life</b> </p>
      <p>Yunick grew up on a farm in Neshaminy, Pennsylvania and had to
        drop out of school to run the farm at age 16, upon the death of
        his father. This, however, gave him an opportunity to exercise
        his talents for improvising and optimizing mechanical solutions;
        for instance, constructing a tractor from the remains of a
        junked car. In his spare time, he built and raced motorcycles;
        this is where he got his nickname, "Smokey", derived from the
        behavior of one of his motorcycles. </p>
      <p>When World War II broke out in 1941, Yunick joined the Army Air
        Corps, piloting a B-17 Flying Fortress named "Smokey and his
        Firemen" on more than 50 missions over Europe. He was with the
        97th Bombardment Group (Heavy) of the 15th Air Force, at
        Amendola Airfield, Italy, before being transferred to the war's
        Pacific theater following VE Day. In 1946, Yunick married and
        moved to Daytona Beach, Florida, because it was warm and looked
        good when he had flown over it on training missions. </p>
      <p><b>Smokey's Garage</b> </p>
      <p>Yunick ran "Smokey's Best Damn Garage in Town" on Beach Street
        in Daytona Beach, Florida from 1947, when he opened the garage
        repairing trucks, until 1987 when he closed it, claiming that
        there were no more good mechanics. </p>
      <p><b>Automobile racing</b> </p>
      <p>When Yunick's reputation as a good mechanic spread through the
        town, Marshall Teague, a local stock car race team owner,
        invited him to join the team and Yunick accepted, despite being
        completely unfamiliar with stock car racing. He prepared a
        Hudson Hornet for driver Herb Thomas for the second running of
        the Southern 500 in Darlington, South Carolina, which won the
        race. By the end of his racing career, Yunick's teams would have
        included 50 of the most famous drivers in the sport, winning 57
        races, two Grand National championships, and twice NASCAR
        mechanic of the year. </p>
      <p>Between 1958 and 1973, Yunick also participated in Indianapolis
        500 racing, his car winning the 1960 race. His innovations here
        included the "Reverse Torque Special" of 1959, with the engine
        running in opposite rotation than normal, and a car with the
        drivers capsule mounted "sidesaddle" in 1964. In 1962, Yunick
        changed open wheel racing forever when he mounted a wing on Jim
        Rathmann's Simoniz Vista Special Watson Roadster. The wing,
        designed to increase downforce, allowed Rathmann to reach
        cornering speeds never before seen at the Indianapolis Motor
        Speedway but created so much drag that it actually caused the
        car to record slower lap times. The United States Automobile
        Club (USAC) immediately banned the use of wings but they soon
        began to appear on cars competing in Formula One and by the
        early 1970s USAC once again allowed their use. He also
        participated in drag racing. </p>
      <p>Yunick's racing career brought him into contact with
        representatives of the automotive industry, and he became
        Chevrolet's unofficial factory race team, as well as heading
        NASCAR efforts for Ford and Pontiac. Much of the
        high-performance development of the Chevrolet Small-Block engine
        involved Yunick in design, testing, or both. Yunick raced
        Chevrolets in 1955 and 1956, Fords in 1957 and 1958, and
        Pontiacs from 1959 through 1963. It was with Pontiac that Yunick
        became the first team owner to win the Daytona 500 twice (1961
        and 1962), and first to put a driver, his close friend Fireball
        Roberts, on the pole three times (1960–1962); this also made
        Pontiac the first manufacturer to do so. </p>
      <p>Following Fireball Roberts' 1964 crash at Charlotte — where
        after 40 days in pain from burns, he died — Yunick began a
        campaign for safety modifications to prevent a repeat of such
        disasters. After being overruled repeatedly by NASCAR's owner,
        Bill France Sr., Yunick left NASCAR in 1970. </p>
      <p>As with most successful racers, Yunick was a master of the gray
        area straddling the rules. Perhaps his most famous exploit was
        his #13 1966 Chevrolet Chevelle, driven by Curtis Turner. The
        car was so much faster than the competition during testing that
        they were certain that cheating was involved; some sort of
        aerodynamic enhancement was strongly suspected, but the car's
        profile seemed to be entirely stock, as the rules required. It
        was eventually discovered that what Yunick had built was an
        exact 7/8 scale replica of the production car. Since then,
        NASCAR required each race car's roof, hood, and trunk to fit
        templates representing the production car's exact profile. More
        recently, these templates represent an agreed upon
        "specification body" that has minimal connection to a production
        car's profile. The shape has been developed with extensive wind
        tunnel testing to "level the playing field" across several
        manufacturer's products. </p>
      <p>Another Yunick improvisation was getting around the regulations
        specifying a maximum size for the fuel tank, by using eleven
        foot (three meter) coils of 2-inch (5-centimeter) diameter
        tubing for the fuel line to add about 5 gallons (19 liters)[1]
        to the car's fuel capacity. Once, NASCAR officials came up with
        a list of nine items for Yunick to fix before the car would be
        allowed on the track. The suspicious NASCAR officials had
        removed the tank for inspection. Yunick started the car with no
        gas tank and said "Better make it ten,"[2] and drove it back to
        the pits. He used a basketball in the fuel tank which could be
        inflated when the car's fuel capacity was checked and deflated
        for the race. </p>
      <p>Yunick also used such innovations as offset chassis, raised
        floors, roof spoilers, nitrous oxide injection, and other
        modifications often within the letter of the rule-book, if not
        the spirit. "All those other guys were cheatin' 10 times worse
        than us," Yunick wrote in his autobiography, "so it was just
        self-defense." Yunick's success was also due to his expertise in
        the aerodynamics of racing cars. </p>
      <p>Yunick also built a 1968 Camaro for Trans-Am racing. Although
        Yunick set several speed and endurance records with the car at
        Bonneville Speedway, with both a 302 cubic inch (~5000 cubic
        centimeter) and a 396 cubic inch (~6500 cubic centimeter)
        engine, it never won a race while Yunick owned it. It was later
        sold to Don Yenko, who did win several races. In typical Yunick
        fashion, the car, although superficially a stock Camaro, had
        acid-dipped body panels and thinner window glass to reduce
        weight, the front end of the body tilted downwards and the
        windshield laid back for aerodynamics, all four fenders widened,
        the front subframe Z'ed and the floorpan moved up to lower the
        car, and many other detailed modifications. The drip rails were
        even brought closer to the body for a tiny aerodynamic
        improvement. A connector to the engine oil system was extended
        into the car's interior, to allow the driver to add oil from a
        pressurized hose during pit stops. In order to allow the driver
        enough freedom of movement, the shoulder harness was modified to
        include a cable-ratchet mechanism from a military helicopter. In
        1993, Vic Edelbrock, Jr. purchased and restored the car.
        Contrary to popular opinion, Yunick designed the first "safer
        barrier" in the early 1960's using old tires between sheets of
        plywood but NASCAR did not adopt his idea and it took the death
        of Dale Earnhardt to finally install safer barriers at NASCAR
        tracks. Indianapolis Motor Speedway was the first track to
        install them. Also Yunick developed air jacks for stock cars in
        1961 but NASCAR thought and still thinks it is safer to have a
        jackman running around a car during a pitstop rather than using
        air jacks. </p>
      <p><b>Awards</b> </p>
      <p>He was inducted in the International Motorsports Hall of Fame
        in 1990 (inaugural year) and the Motorsports Hall of Fame of
        America in 2000. Smokey is a member of over 30 Halls of Fame
        across the United State and the rest of the world. Some of his
        personal items, including hats, pipes, boots, engines, etc. are
        on display (loan from family most of them) at museums from race
        tracks to the Smithsonian (history of racing). </p>
      <p>Smokey was the NASCAR Mechanic of the Year twice.[3] </p>
      <p><b>Patents</b> </p>
      <p>Yunick is the inventor of at least nine US patents.[4] <br>

      <p><b>Scientific achievements</b> </p>
      <p>Aside from racing, Yunick's innovations include variable ratio
        power steering, the extended tip spark plug, reverse flow
        cooling systems, a high efficiency vapor carburetor, a
        high-efficiency adiabatic engine, various engine testing
        devices, and a safety wall for racetracks, made of discarded
        tires, which NASCAR's France had refused to consider. He was
        granted twelve patents. He also experimented with synthetic oil
        and alternative energy sources such as hydrogen, natural gas,
        windmills, solar panels, as well as involving himself in
        developing the gold mining and petroleum industries in Ecuador.

      <p><b>Author</b> </p>
      <p>His column "Say, Smokey" was a staple of Popular Science
        magazine in the 1960s and 1970s; it consisted of his responses
        to letters sent to him by readers regarding mechanical
        conditions affecting their cars and technical questions about
        how automotive performance could be improved. He also wrote for
        Circle Track magazine, and published his autobiography Best Damn
        Garage in Town in January 2001. The audiobook version was
        narrated by longtime friend John DeLorean. </p>
      <p>In 1984, Yunick published Smokey's Power Secrets (ISBN
        0931472067). </p>
      <p><b>Legacy</b> </p>
      <p>After Yunick's death, his shop's contents were auctioned off,
        according to his wishes. He had witnessed his friend Don
        Garlits' difficulties developing and maintaining a museum and
        did not want either his family to be saddled with such a burden,
        or a "high roller" to gain control of his reputation. Instead,
        he preferred that his tools, equipment, cars, engines, and parts
        go to people who would use them, and before his death he
        undertook to restore as much of it as possible to working
        condition. The proceeds of the auction went to a foundation to
        fund innovations in motorsports. </p>
