  <b><font size="+1">Apparatus and operating method for an internal
combustion
engine</font></b></p>
  </center>
  <p>June 3, 1986 <br>
  <b>Abstract</b> --- A method and apparatus for operating an electric
ignition, internal combustion engine that substantially improves the
fuel
efficiency by utilizing heat normally discharged to the ambient to
condition
and prepare the fuel mixture prior to entry into the combustion
chambers.
The apparatus comprises a fuel vaporizer (50) that transfers heat from
the engine coolant system to the fuel mixture as it leaves a fuel
introducing
device such as a carburetor (38); a fuel mixture heater (52) for
heating
the mixture above the vaporization temperature of the liquid fuel; and,
a mixture homogenizer (54) for thoroughly stirring the fuel mixture
that
is located in the fuel mixture flow path intermediate the vaporizer and
heater. The homogenizer is operative to compress the fuel mixture under
certain engine operating conditions and the heater forms the intake
manifold
for the engine and includes branch flow paths (152a) and associated
conduits
(164) that communicate directly with each combustion chamber (32)
through
a valve controlled port (34a). The fuel mixture flow path from the
homogenizer
is constructed to minimize energy losses to the ambient. </p>

  <p><b>DESCRIPTION</b> </p>
  <p><b>1. Technical Field</b> </p>
  <p>The present invention relates generally to electric ignition,
internal
combusion engines each of which functions as an expander during a
portion
of a cycle and in particular to a new and improved fuel system and
engine
operating method. </p>
  <p><b>2. Background Art</b> </p>
  <p>In conventional gasoline engines, particularly those used in the
automotive
industry, a carburetor mounted atop an intake manifold forms the
principal
component of a fuel system. As is well known, combustion air is drawn
through
the carburetor. A controlled amount of gasoline is added to the
incoming
air to form a combustible fuel/air mixture, as the air passes through a
venturi throat formed in the carburetor. The intake manifold, which
includes
passages that communicate with valve controlled intake ports in the
cylinder
head of the engine, conveys and distributes the fuel/air mixture from
the
carburetor to the combustion chambers. </p>
  <p>In theory, the liquid gasoline is vaporized prior to entering the
combustion
chambers. In practice, however, a major portion of the gasoline remains
unvaporized and in a liquid state even as it enters the combustion
chamber,
finally vaporizing during the combustion process. The presence of
unvaporized
fuel in the combustion chamber, reduces the heat of combustion, thus
limiting
the power output of the engine. </p>
  <p>It has long been recognized that the efficiency of the gasoline
engine
is substantially less than ideal. One factor contributing to poor
efficiency
in some engines is known as carburetor "double pull". Since the intake
port is usually opened well before the exhaust stroke is completed,
gases
are forced in a reverse direction through the carburetor venturi
drawing
fuel into this flow. This reverse flow goes into the air inlet and
filter
wasting fuel. Another factor is a substantial portion of the energy
available
in each pound of gasoline consumed by an engine, is discharged to the
ambient
as waste heat from its cooling and exhaust systems and by way of
radiation
from the engine. Automotive designers over the years have proposed
methods
and apparatus for recapturing and utilizing at least a portion of this
waste heat. </p>
  <p>One proposed apparatus is an exhaust driven supercharger, more
commonly
called a turbocharger. A turbocharger generally comprises a pair of
turbines
mounted to a common shaft. One turbine is a drive turbine disposed in
an
exhaust flow path, while the other turbine is a compressor turbine
disposed,
at least in some instances, in the intake flow path between the
carburetor
and the combustion chambers. In this configuration, the exhaust gases
discharged
by the combination chambers expand across the exhaust turbine to rotate
it and the intake turbine thereby compressing gases in the fuel air
mixture.
This compression permits an increase in the amount of fuel introduced
into
each piston cylinder during the intake stroke of its piston while
maintaining
a desired fuel/air ratio, to produce an attendant increase in the
engine's
power output. </p>
  <p>The addition of a turbocharger has not increased engine fuel
efficiency
in normal automotive usage. In general, the turbocharger allows a
smaller
engine with less friction to be used in a given size vehicle. </p>
  <p>With these prior engines under operating conditions where cylinder
intake
produces high vacuum, pressure from the ambient air on the intake side
of the turbocharger may exceed manifold pressure thus creating a
pressure
differential across the compressor side of the turbocharger. When an
engine
is idling there is little exhaust flow to drive the turbine and high
vacuum
manifold conditions exist so there is a large pressure differential
across
the compressor side of the turbocharger. This pressure differential
causes
an air flow through the compressor side. This air flow applies
rotational
forces to the compressor blade in opposition to the drive turbine. </p>
  <p>Because exhaust flow is low, the air flow produced forces may be
sufficient
to cause reverse rotation of the compressor and will in any event
prevent
effective turbocharger operation. Thus, under light load the
turbocharger
is essentially inoperative and in fact may run backwards. </p>
  <p>Another problem with each prior engine with a turbocharger between
its
carburetor and its intake manifold occurs on acceleration. When the
throttle
opening is increased, the quantity of liquid fuel droplets contained in
the fuel/air mixture is increased virtually instantaneously but exhaust
flow is not. This additional liquid fuel causes a significant increase
in the load on the compressor turbine. Indeed in test racing engines
the
load increases on occasion, have been great enough to cause compressor
turbine destruction. Since the driving force from exhaust gases is
substantially
constant the compressor is slowed by this load increase and the
compressing
action of the turbocharger is reduced. In time the increased fuel
produces
increased exhaust gases, causing the turbocharger to increase its speed
and output. In sum, prior turbocharged engines have slow response to
demands
for power increases and will consume excessive fuel for a time whenever
there is a significant increase in throttle opening. In fact, this
excessive
fuel consumption has made it difficult, if not impossible, for prior
turbocharged
engines to meet Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) standards if the
turbocharger in fact operates during testing. </p>
  <p>Other proposals for increasing the fuel efficiency of gasoline
engines
have included methods and apparatus for heating the fuel to aid
vaporization.
Prior proposals have suggested heating the fuel-air mixture by
transferring
heat from either the engine cooling system or the engine exhaust
system.
Problems associated with heating a fuel/air mixture as it travels to a
combustion chamber, have long been recognized. </p>
  <p>These problems include an increase in the temperature of the fuel
mixture
decreases the mixture density and causes a decrease in the volumetric
efficiency
of the engine for it decreases the amount of fuel drawn into each
cylinder
during an intake stroke. In addition, heating the fuel often causes a
vapor
lock condition in the fuel system which partially or completely blocks
the flow of fuel into the intake flow path, degrading engine
performance.
To avoid vapor lock, many of the proposed fuel mixture heaters operate
during engine warmup only and are turned off once the engine reaches it
operating temperature. Further, prior hot vapor engine proposals have
utilized
storage chambers from which the fuel air mixture is modulated. Such a
chamber
is large and can be dangerous. </p>
  <p>With prior engines, during engine warmup, vaporized fuel condensed
on
the interior walls of the intake manifold and other surfaces. Manifold
and carburetor heating systems have been proposed to operate during
engine
warmup and were intended to solve or minimize this problem. While such
proposals might improve conditions during warmup, the fuel still
experienced
as many as four phase changes as it travelled from the carburetor to
the
combustion chambers, even in an engine that had reached its operating
temperature.
Specifically, portions of the fuel entrained in the mixture flow shift
between vapor and liquid states as the mixture travels through the
engine
intake system. Moreover, these phase change characteristics in a
multi-cylinder
engine are uneven varying from cylinder to cylinder and further varying
with engine speed and load. </p>
  <p>These phase changes contribute to the reduction in thermal
efficiency
in an engine due to: (1) the induction of some liquid fuel into the
combustion
chambers; (2) the nonuniform nature of the fuel-air mixture; and, (3)
substantial
heat energy losses to the intake manifold and other components of the
fuel
system. These losses are substantial because gasoline, like all
liquids,
has a relatively high heat of vaporization. </p>
  <p>The prior porposals for increasing the thermal efficiency of an
engine
have not recognized or addressed this problem. In most of the proposed
systems, the fuel or fuel mixture was merely to be heated by either
fluid
from the engine cooling system or alternately by exhaust gases. </p>
  <p>Combining a turbocharger with a fuel mixture heating apparatus has
been
proposed in the past. In one such proposal, the fuel charge would be
heated
by exhaust gases during part throttle operating conditions only. During
full throttle conditions, the exhaust gases would be diverted to a
turbocharger
and the fuel mixture would go unheated, so that its density would be
maximized. </p>
  <p>It has also been found that many engine designers are of the
opinion
that the fuel mixture should be cooled after leaving a turbocharger or
a supercharger. A cooling device commonly called an "intercooler" is
disposed
between the outlet of the supercharger and the combustion chambers. The
purpose of the intercooler is to remove the heat generated as the
mixture
is compressed so that the fuel mixture density is increased. These
seemingly
conflicting proposals would indicate that confusion and uncertainty
still
exist in fuel system design theory. </p>
  <p>The measure of success, however, in increasing the fuel efficiency
of
an internal combustion engine does not reside in the complexity or
simplicity
of the apparatus of the rigid adherence to long taught engine design
principals,
but in the increase in gasoline mileage and engine performance actually
achieved in a given size engine. </p>
  <p><b>DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION</b> </p>
  <p>The present invention provides a new and improved apparatus and
method
for improving the fuel efficiency of an electric ignition, internal
combustion
engine. It is readily adaptable to existing automobile engines for it
does
not require excessive engine retooling and it will decrease the cost
and
weight of the vehicle. </p>
  <p>According to the invention, a fuel charge forming apparatus is
disclosed
for combining a vaporizable fuel, such as gasoline, with combustion air
in controlled proportions. The apparatus utilizes heat normally
exhausted
by the engine to condition the fuel mixture. The apparatus prepares and
conditions the fuel/air mixture during its laminar flow travel to the
engine
combustion chambers to insure complete fuel vaporization and thorough
fuel/air
mixing so that maximum energy output is realized during the combustion
process. </p>
  <p>In the preferred embodiment, a fuel mixture flow path is defined
that
extends between a fuel mixture introducing device, such as a carburetor
and the engine combustion chambers. The flow path communicates with
each
combustion chamber through an associated valve controlled port. The
apparatus
further comprises an air heater and fuel/air mixture vaporizing and
heating
devices disposed in the flow path, and a fuel mixture homogenizer
located
between the fuel mixture vaporizing and heating devices. While tests of
the present invention have been conducted using a conventional
carburetor,
it is believed that the operation of the apparatus does not depend on
the
use of a carburetor; alternate methods for introducing fuel into an air
flow path such as pressure carburetion and manifold injection are also
contemplated. </p>
  <p>In the preferred embodiment, the fuel mixture vaporizer includes a
chamber
disposed in the flow path intermediate the carburetor and the fuel
mixture
homogenizer that is heated by fluid from an engine cooling system. The
heat absorbed by the engine cooling system, which in the past has been
wasted, is transferred to the incoming fuel mixture as it passes
through
the vaporizer chamber thereby enhancing fuel vaporization and producing
an at least partially vaporized mixture. </p>
  <p>The mixture is then directed to the fuel mixture homogenizer which
stirs
and further heats the mixture so that the fuel is fully vaporized to a
"supervaporized" state and the vapor is uniformly dispersed. </p>
  <p>The preferred homogenizer is exhaust driven and includes a pair of
turbines
mounted on a common shaft and rotatably supported in a structure that
defines
separate turbine chambers. One turbine is an exhaust driven turbine and
it, in turn, drives the other turbine which is an homogonizing turbine
disposed in the fuel mixture flow path. The turbines are sized to
provide
both mixing and mixture pressurization at all throttle openings. Unlike
the prior art turbo-chargers, the homogenizer functions throughout the
engine operating range insuring thorough fuel vaporization and mixing
and
dispersion of the fuel uniformly throughout the air of the mixture. One
major reason the homogenizer functions throughout the engines operating
range is that the fuel/air mixture is temperature expanded across the
homogenizing
turbine applying rotational force additive to the exhaust gas produced
forces. </p>
  <p>In one version of the engine the heated homogenizer housing
defines
intake air flow passages which are connected to the carburetor air
intake
by a hot air conduit. Air is heated as it passes through these
passages.
A temperature responsive valve closes off an ambient air inlet to the
carburetor
whenever air supplied by the hot air conduit is below about 110.degree.
F. and manifold vacuum is above four inches. </p>
  <p>An EGR system is provided in the version of the engine which has
preheated
air. Unlike prior EGR systems, the system of the present invention
assures
uniform distribution of recirculated exhaust and vaporization of
residual
hydrocarbons. This uniformity is accomplished by introducing the EGR
fluids
to the fuel/air mixture flow path at or ahead of the entrance to the
homogenizer.
As these residuals are passed through the homogenizers they are
thoroughly
admixed with the fuel/air mixture assuring for the first time uniform
distribution
of the residuals among the combustion chambers. </p>
  <p>Since the fuel/air mixture is preheated before it is introduced
into
the homogenizer its specific density is low and little, if any,
unvaporized
fuel is present. Thus the fuel air mixture is comparatively easy to
compress
and continuous compression of its output can and does occur at all
engine
speeds. In addition the outlet from the chamber is somewhat restricted
to partially isolate the homogenizer's mixing chamber from pressure
differentials
between the input and output sides of the homogenizer which occur
during
power demand conditions and prevents a "double pull" on the fuel
supply.
This isolation coupled with the low specific density of the fuel/air
mixture
and the mixtures thermal expansion permit the homogenizer to function
efficiently
during acceleration. Thus, the homogenizer operates at idle conditions
and response lag is not experienced during accelerating conditions. </p>
  <p>The fuel mixture heater is disposed in the mixture flow path
between
the outlet of the homogenizer and the intake ports of the engine. In
the
preferred embodiment, the fuel mixture heater includes an exhaust
heated
chamber through which the mixture passes on its way to the combustion
chamber.
The heater insures that the fuel remains in its completely vaporized
state,
preferably at a temperature twice the vaporization temperature of the
fuel,
prior to entering the combustion chamber. </p>
  <p>It is believed that automobile engines presently being
manufactured
can be modified or adapted to utilize the present invention and thereby
realize a substantial gain in fuel efficiency. Some conventional
components
are eliminated and those components which are used do not require
exotic
materials, extensive engine retooling or complicated manufacturing
processes.
In addition, smaller engines can be standard equipment in present
automobiles
to decrease their cost and weight. </p>
  <p>According to the exemplary and illustrated embodiment, the fuel
mixture
vaporizer comprises a housing that also serves as a mounting base for
the
carburetor. The housing defines an interior chamber that communicates
with
the throat of the carburetor and an outlet conduit that conveys the
fuel
mixture from the chamber to the homogenizer. Coolant passages, located
in the walls of the housing, support coolant flow between an inlet and
an outlet forming part of the vaporizer. Suitable conduits communicate
the coolant inlet and outlet with the engine cooling system. A small
radiator
is coupled in parallel with the vaporizer. A thermostatically
controlled
valve blocks flow to the radiator whenever coolant temperature is below
about 200.degree. F. </p>
  <p>The fuel mixture heater comprises a housing that includes passages
in
the side walls through which exhaust gases travel and heat the interior
walls of the plenum. According to a feature of this embodiment, the
chamber
includes vertically standing ribs which subdivide the mixture flow into
a plurality of branch flow paths, the number of which corresponds to
the
number of cylinders in the engine. Conduits direct exhaust gases from
the
combustion chambers to the passages formed in the walls of the plenum
chamber. </p>
  <p>The disclosed apparatus recaptures heat normally wasted from both
the
engine cooling system and the engine exhaust system and utilizes this
heat
to completely vaporize and thoroughly mix the fuel mixture. As a
result,
the size of the vehicle radiator can be significantly reduced and the
need
for a radiator fan is eliminated. </p>
  <p>Normally, the coolant radiator is necessary to provide the means
for
discharging the waste heat absorbed by the engine coolant. In the
present
invention, the waste heat is transferred and absorbed by the vaporizing
fuel. The heat absorbed by the fuel reduces the coolant temperature and
thus supplants a significant part of the radiator function. </p>
  <p>Additionally, the coolant system conduits and pump are sized so
that
the coolant flow rate through the engine is linear with engine output
to
provide the requisite amount of heat to the fuel mixture vaporizer. </p>
  <p>According to another feature of the invention, an isolator is
positioned
between the carburetor and the fuel mixture homogenizer. The purpose of
the isolator is to inhibit direct, uncontrolled heat conductivity along
the mixture flow path to the base and thence to the bowl of the
carburetor.
The isolator minimizes the incidence of vapor lock that might occur in
the carburetor when a "hot" engine is turned off. The isolator inhibits
the transmission of engine heat to the bowl of the carburetor through
the
structure that defines the mixture flow path. </p>
  <p>In a more specific embodiment, the isolator comprises an
elastomeric,
nonconductive coupling between the outlet of the engine preheater and
the
inlet to the homogenizer. In this preferred embodiment, the carburetor
and vaporizer are mounted to the vehicle chassis or body and hence the
isolator prevents not only the transmission of heat to the carburetor
but
engine vibration as well. It is believed the vibration isolation
provided
by this isolator construction and carburetor mounting increases the
reliability
of the carburetor, prevents loss of fuel flow control due to vibration,
and should reduce the incidence of carburetor readjustment. </p>
  <p>The present invention discloses a method for operating an engine
in
which all the fuel is fully vaporized before it is introduced into the
combustion chamber and once vaporized remains vaporized as it is
conducted
through the engine intake system. The fuel is not only completely
vaporized
but is also thoroughly mixed so that a uniform fuel and air mixture
enters
the combustion chamber. According to the method, the fuel, such as
gasoline,
is entrained in a flow of atmospheric air. The entrained fuel and air,
forming a somewhat non-homogenous fuel mixture is preheated by heat
derived
from the engine, i.e., from either the engine cooling or engine exhaust
system. The fuel and atmospheric air is then mixed by a homogenizer to
produce a uniform fuel/air mixture. The homogenous mixture is then
further
heated to a temperature well in excess of, preferably at least twice,
the
vaporization temperature of the fuel and then it is introduced,
virtually
immediately, into a combustion chamber. </p>
  <p>In order to take full advantage of the fuel preparation apparatus
and
method disclosed above, the present invention also provides additional
method steps for operating an engine to optimize the amount of energy
extracted
from the fuel charge inducted into the combustion chamber. This
optimizes
the power output of the engine and reduces the amount of heat which
must
be taken out with a cooling system thus contributing to the reduction
in
radiator size. According to these additional method steps, the volume
of
the combustion chamber is held substantially constant during the
combustion
process until the gases and products of combustion reaction
substantially
reach their maximum temperature and pressure. In order to accomplish
these
method steps, the crankshaft stroke and piston rod length are selected
so that the piston remains within 0.001 inches of top-dead-center (TDC)
for at least 13.degree. of crankshaft rotation. </p>
  <p>It is believed that the disclosed fuel charge forming apparatus
used
in connection with the engine operating method disclosed by the present
invention provides an engine that functions as an "expander", that is,
an engine in which all useful expansion forces generated during
combustion
are utilized for producing motion in the piston and to a significant
extent,
are not dissipated as heat losses. Maintaining the piston virtually at
TDC until, the combustion temperature and pressure are optimized
assures
that the heat energy generated is primarily dissipated in driving the
piston
downwardly, minimizing heat losses to the engine cooling and exhaust
systems.
Moreover, heat released to these engine systems is returned to the
incoming
fuel mixture via the fuel vaporizing and heating devices and the
homogenizer.
In essence, the present invention provides a "hot vapor cycle" engine
in
which balanced heat loops transfer heat from the engine to the fuel
mixture
flow path, the heat transferred being proportional to engine output. </p>
  <p>The apparatus and method disclosed by the present invention has
been
found to substantially increase the fuel efficiency and power output of
a gasoline automotive engine. Moreover, it was found that the low rpm
torque
was also increased while the tendency towards pre-ignition and
detonation
were decreased. </p>

  <p><b>BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</b> </p>
  <p>The present invention provides a new and improved apparatus and
method
for substantially improving the fuel efficiency of an electric
ignition,
internal combustion engine. In accordance with the invention, engine
heat
normally discharged to the ambient by the exhaust and coolant systems
is
captured and utilized to prepare and condition the incoming fuel
mixture
so that increased combustion efficiency is realized. In particular, the
present invention thoroughly mixes and vaporizes the incoming fuel
charge
prior to entry into the engine combustion chambers. </p>
  <p>FIG. 1 schematically illustrates an apparatus defining fuel and
exhaust
flow path constructed in accordance with the preferred embodiment of
the
invention. Referring also to FIGS. 3 and 4, the apparatus is connected
to an internal combustion engine 20 which in the illustrated embodiment
includes three cylinders 22, formed in an engine block 24, each
cylinder
22 including an associated piston 26. The pistons 26 are operatively
connected
to a crank shaft (an output end 28 of the crank shaft is shown in FIG.
3) by connecting rods in the conventional manner so that reciprocal
movement
in the pistons 26 produces rotary motion in the crank shaft 28. </p>
  <p>A cylinder head 30 is suitably fastened to the top of the engine
block
24 and defines a combustion chamber 32 in each cylinder 24 (shown in
FIG.
4). A pair of cam driven poppet valves 33 (only one valve 33 is shown)
controls the inflow of the fuel/air mixture into the combustion chamber
32 and the outflow of combustion products. The head 30 includes
integrally
formed intake and exhaust passages (only the intake passage 34 is
shown).
The intake passages 34 extend from ports 34a formed in the side of the
cylinder head 30 (shown in FIG. 3) and the intake valves 33. Coolant
passages
36 support coolant flow through the head for removing excess heat
during
engine operation. The coolant is discharged from the cylinder head 30
through
an outlet port 36a. The cylinder block 24 also includes coolant
passages
38. </p>
  <p>Returning to FIG. 1, the present invention provides an apparatus
and
structure, indicated generally by the reference character 37 that
defines
a fuel mixture flow path extending between the cylinder intake ports
34a
and a fuel introducing device 38, preferably a carburetor. According to
the invention, means for thoroughly vaporizing and mixing the fuel
mixture
as it travels from the carburetor 38 to the engine combustion chambers
32 is provided. </p>
  <p>Liquid fuel is delivered to the carburetor 38 from a fuel tank 40
by
a conventional fuel pump 42 and associated conduits 44. Preferably, the
carburetor 38 operates in a conventional manner and combines controlled
amounts of air and liquid fuel to form a combustible fuel mixture. </p>
  <p>In general, only a portion of the liquid fuel will be partially
vaporized
in a throat of the carburetor as it enters the air flow stream. In
accordance
with the invention, a fuel mixture vaporizer 50 and a fuel mixture
heating
device 52 are disposed in and preferably form a part of a fuel mixture
flow path 37 to insure complete fuel vaporization and to heat the
fuel/air
mixture above the vaporization temperature of the liquid fuel,
preferably
to a temperature which is twice the vaporization temperature of the
fuel.
A fuel mixture homogenizer, indicated generally by the reference
character
54 is disposed in the flow path intermediate the vaporizer 50 and the
heating
device 52. </p>
  <p>In the preferred embodiment the fuel mixture vaporizer 50 heats
the
fuel mixture with heat from the engine coolant system. The invention
does
contemplate the use of exhaust heat if coolant heat is unavailable,
i.e.,
in an air-cooled engine. The engine coolant fluid loop for
accomplishing
this feature of the invention is illustrated in FIG. 2. The cooling
circuit
includes a conventional water pump 60 for pumping coolant into the
engine
block 24 and the cylinder head 30. The coolant is delivered to the
engine
through a supply conduit 62 and is discharged from the head 30 into an
outlet conduit 64 through the coolant port 36a formed in the cylinder
head
30 (shown in FIG. 3). The outlet conduit 64 has a valve 65 for
adjusting
the fluid flow through it. The outlet conduit 64 delivers coolant to
the
vaporizer 50. The coolant circulates through the vaporizer and is
subsequently
discharged into a return conduit 66. The conduit 66 communicates with
the
inlet side of the pump. </p>
  <p>A thermostat housing 68 including a conventional thermostat (now
shown)
is provided for controlling the fluid communication between the conduit
64 and a radiator input conduit 70. As long as a coolant remains below
a predetermined temperature (determined by the thermostat) the
thermostat
remains closed and the coolant is conveyed to the input of the coolant
pump 60 through the conduit 66. In this operating mode, the coolant
circulation
loop includes only the pump 60, the engine block and head 24, 30 and
the
vaporizer 50. Should the coolant temperature exceed the thermostat
setting,
the thermostat will open and communicate the conduit 70 and the coolant
will proceed through a radiator 74 and then be returned to the cooling
pump 60 by a radiator return conduit 76. An electrically driven fan 78,
controlled by a thermostat (not shown) is shown in phantom. In tests
the
fan is not turned on so it preferably is eliminated and has for this
reason
been shown in phantom. It is shown here only because it was present,
through
inoperative, during tests in which certain data was collected. </p>
  <p>The mixture vaporizer 50 preferably mounts and forms the support
base
for the carburetor 38. In accordance with this feature and as seen in
FIGS.
3, 8 and 9, the vaporizer 50 includes a housing 50a and an integrally
formed
carburetor mounted flange 50b including vertically extending retaining
studs 80. Referring in particular to FIGS. 8 and 9, the housing 50a
defines
an interior, heating chamber 82 that communicates with the throat of
the
carburetor through a pair of passages 84 that extend downwardly from
the
top of the carburetor flange 50b and open into the chamber 82. </p>
  <p>A fluid jacket 86 defined by exterior and interior walls 88, 90 of
the
housing 50 surround the chamber 82. Engine coolant is circulated in the
fluid passages 86 so that heat from the engine coolant is transferred
to
the chamber 82 through the interior wall 88. The engine coolant is
communicated
to the vaporizer through an inlet nipple 92 formed in the housing 50a
and
suitably connected to the outlet conduit 64. The coolant leaves the
vaporizer
50 through an outlet nipple 94 (shown in FIG. 9) that is suitably
connected
to the return conduit 66. </p>
  <p>The fuel mixture formed in the throat of the carburetor 38 enters
the
heating chamber 82 through the passages 84. The mixture leaves the
chamber
82 through a chamber outlet 96 formed in the housing 50a and preferably
extending in a direction orthogonal to the axes of the passages 84. </p>
  <p>Under normal engine operating conditions, it has been found that a
substantial
portion of the engine heat absorbed by the engine coolant is released
to
the fuel mixture as the mixture passes through the vaporizer 50. In
effect,
the coolant heat discharged to the vaporizing fuel partially supplants
the need for the coolant radiator 74 and totally supplants the need for
the cooling fan 78, thus allowing the use of fewer and smaller
components. </p>
  <p>It has been found that the coolant flows in many conventional
automobiles
are excessive, resulting in the loss of large amounts of engine heat to
the ambient. This condition is alleviated by the present invention.
According
to the invention, the coolant flow rate through the engine is
proportional
to the power output of the engine so that as the engine output
increases,
proportionately more heat is carried to the fuel mixture preheater 50
for
transfer to the incoming fuel charge. This "heat balance" between the
coolant
flow rate and engine output is achieved by the sizing of the coolant
pump
60 and the adjustment of the control valve 65. In actual production,
the
valve 65 is preferably eliminated by appropriately sizing the various
coolant
conduits. </p>
  <p>Returning to FIG. 1, the homogenizer 54 operates to thoroughly mix
the
fuel mixture received from the vaporizer 50 and insures that the fuel
vapor
is uniformly dispersed throughout the fuel/air mixture. Moreover, the
homogenizer
operates to compress the fuel air mixture thereby increasing the
density
of the fuel charge entering the combustion chambers 32. </p>
  <p>In the preferred embodiment, the homogenizer 54 comprises mixing
and
exhaust driven turbines 102, 104 fixed to a common shaft 106 and
mounted
for rotation within a structure that defines separate turbine chambers
or housings 108, 110 associated with the turbines 102, 104
respectively.
The turbine 104 is disposed in the exhaust flow path and is in part
driven
by the exhaust gases discharged by the engine 20; the rotation of the
turbine
104 produces attendant rotation in the turbine 102. Further rotation
producing
forces are supplied by the mixture flow across the mixing turbine which
results from thermal expansion. The rotation of the turbine 102 stirs
or
homogenizes the fuel mixture passing through the turbine housing 108 on
its way to combustion chambers. </p>
  <p>Referring to FIG. 3, the originally preferred exterior
construction
of the homogenizer 54 is illustrated. The turbine housing 108 includes
an axial inlet 120 through which the fuel mixture from the vaporizer 50
is received. The homogenized fuel mixture leaves the turbine housing
108
through a flanged nozzle outlet 122 that extends tangentially from the
turbine housing 108. The exhaust turbine housing 110 includes a flanged
inlet 124, formed tangentially with respect to the turbine chamber 110.
The exhaust gases passing through the housing 110 are discharged
through
an axial outlet communicating with an exhaust pipe 126. The pipe 126
includes
a flange 126a clamped to the axial outlet by means of studs 128. The
studs
extend from the side of the exhaust turbine housing 110 and are adapted
to receive suitable threaded fasteners (not shown). The exhaust gases
discharged
by engine 20 are conveyed to the exhaust turbine housing by an exhaust
conduit 132 that terminates in a flange 132a. A similar flange 124a is
mounted at the inlet 124 of the housing 110. The flanges 124a, 132
include
a plurality of apertures 125 adapted to receive suitable fasteners for
coupling the flanges 124a, 132a. The turbine 104 is rotatably driven by
the exhaust gases travelling from the conduit 132 to the conduit 126
and
as discussed above, rotation of the turbine 104, in turn, imparts
rotation
to the mixture turbine 102. </p>
  <p>Although the homogenizer 54 bears some physical similarity to a
conventional
turbocharger, which those skilled in the art will recognize as an
exhaust
driven supercharger, its primary functions are the homogenization of
the
fuel mixture and the addition of heat to complete, and assure
maintenance
of, total vaporization of the fuel. Thus, while there is fuel/air
mixture
compression, as is the case with conventional turbochargers, this is
not
the primary function of the homogenizer. In accordance with this
feature
of the invention, the turbines 102, 104 are sized and selected to
rotate
at 2,000 to 4,000 rpm with the engine at idle and to rotate under all
operating
conditions. </p>
  <p>The boost pressure provided by the homogenizer under specific
turbine
speeds is less than the boost pressure that would be provided by a
similarly
sized turbocharger used with a conventional internal combustion engine.
The reason for the reduction in the boost pressure realized by the
present
invention is due to the conditioning of the fuel mixture by the
vaporizer
50. As explained above, the vaporizer 50 adds heat to the incoming fuel
mixture that not only vaporizes the liquid fuel entrained in the fuel
mixture,
but it raises the overall temperature and thus reduces the mixture
density.
This density reduction results in reduced boost pressure for a given
steady
state turbine speed when compared with conventional but more
importantly
results in increased mixing and full vaporization of the fuel/air
mixture.
This reduction in boost pressure for a given turbine speed is offset by
the increase in turbine speed which results in achieving desired boost
pressures. </p>
  <p>Although the boost pressure is somewhat self limiting by the
proper
selection and sizing of the turbines 102, 104, a bypass valve 140 is
provided
on the exhaust turbine housing 110 for bypassing exhaust gas around the
housing in the event a malfunction is encountered that produces an
excessive
boost pressure. </p>
  <p>Unlike conventional turbochargers, the output pressure of the
homogenizer
54 increases immediately upon the initiation of throttle acceleration.
As is known in the art, movement of the throttle produces an immediate
injection of fuel via an accelerating pump and/or other acceleration
enrichment
devices. The addition of fuel to the intake flow path does not
simultaneously
produce a proportionate increase in air flow through the carburetor.
The
air flow increases only upon an increase in engine RPM. </p>
  <p>In conventional turbocharged engines, the output of the
turbocharger
will increase only upon an increase in engine RPM which produces the
necessary
increased exhaust flow. In the present invention, the homogenizer 54
rotates
throughout the engine operating range. As explained above, the mixture
density is reduced by the vaporizer 50. When acceleration is first
initiated,
the injected fuel immediately increases the specific density of the
fuel/air
mixture. This increased mixture density immediately increases the
pressure
in the homogenizer 54, even though the engine RPM has not yet
increased. </p>
  <p>The homogenized fuel mixture leaves the turbine housing 108 and
enters
the fuel mixture heater 52. Referring to FIGS. 3, 5, 6 and 7, the fuel
mixture heater 52 functions somewhat as an intake manifold for the
cylinder
head 30 in that it divides and distributes the fuel mixture to the
individual
cylinders 22. </p>
  <p>In the preferred embodiment, the fuel mixture heater 52 comprises
an
exhaust heated housing 150 that includes spaced interior and exterior
walls
150a, 150b, respectively, between which are defined passages through
which
exhaust gases circulate to heat an interior chamber 152 defined by the
interior wall 150a and a cover plate 154 (shown in FIG. 3) fastened to
the top of the housing 150 by suitable fasteners 156. The fuel mixture
is communicated to the chamber 152 through an inlet aperture 158 formed
in the side of the housing 150. A plurality of laterally extending
studs
160 extend from the side of the housing 150 and attach the mounting
flange
122a of the homogenizer outlet 122 to the housing 150. </p>
  <p>A pair of vertically standing ribs 162 are disposed in the chamber
152,
a spaced distance from the aperture 158. The ribs 162 subdivide the
mixture
flow into a plurality of branch flow paths 152a, each path
communicating
with one of the three combustion chambers 22. Preferably, relatively
short,
individual conduits 164 extend between the housing 150 and a mounting
flange
166 adapted to be attached to the side of the head 30, as seen in FIG.
3. Each conduit 164 communicates one of the branch flow passages 152a
with
one of the cylinder head intake ports 34a. A nipple 170 is also mounted
to the flange 166 and communicates the coolant discharge port 36a in
the
cylinder head with the conduit 64 (shown in FIG. 2). </p>
  <p>The path of exhaust gas flow to the fuel/air mixture heater 52 and
the
homogenizer 54 is shown schematically in FIG. 1. The exhaust conduit
132
extends into fluid communication with a plurality of exhaust ports (not
shown) formed in the cylinder head 30 through three branch conduits
174,
terminating in mounting flanges 174a. The branch conduits have
elongated
straight sections adjacent the flanges to minimize back pressure. As
seen
in FIG. 3, the left end of the conduit 132 is fitted with a coupling
flange
176. A short nipple 178 and associated flange 178a extend from the side
of the conduit 132 about midway between the ends. As also seen in FIGS.
5 and 6, a pair of relatively short conduits 180, 182 fitted with
mounting
flanges 180a, 182a extend downwardly and laterally from the heater
housing
150, respectively. </p>
  <p>A conduit 184 (shown schematically in FIG. 1) communicates exhaust
gas
from the left end of the conduit 132 to the conduit 180. The outlet 182
is coupled directly to the flange 178a of the conduit 178 extending
from
the side of the conduit 132 and forms a return path for the exhaust
gases.
A pair of suitable flow control valves 186, 188 are disposed in the
conduits
184, 132 and are used to adjust the exhaust flow in the respective
conduits.
The valve 186 controls the amount of exhaust gas that is communicated
to
the fuel mixture heater 52. By properly adjusting the respective valves
a heat balance is obtained wherein the exhaust gas conveyed to the
heater
52 will deliver the requisite amount of heat to the fuel mixture, the
heat
delivered being a function of the power output of the engine. In actual
mass production of the engine, the valves 186, 188 are preferably
eliminated
by suitably sizing the conduits 132, 180, 182 and 184 to achieve the
requisite
flow rate of exhaust gas through the fuel mixture heater 52. While
insulation
is not shown for clarity, all of the exhaust gas conduits are
preferably
insulated further to minimize heat losses. </p>
  <p>Turning now to FIG. 4, the profile of the fuel mixture flow path
between
the homogenizer 54 and the combustion chamber 32 is detailed. The
geometry
of the disclosed flow path minimizes energy losses because the mixture
flow encounters very little path deviation. The fuel mixture leaves the
homogenizer 54 along a tangential path defined by the nozzle outlet 122
and enters the fuel mixture heating chamber 52 along a substantially
straight
path. The branch flow paths 152a extend substantially equal distances
to
the conduits 164 and flare outwardly from the axis of the nozzle outlet
flow less than 8.degree.. The branch flow paths 152a, the conduits 164,
and the cylinder head intake passages 34 define a gradual, downwardly
curving
flow path that extends between the chamber 152 and each combustion
chamber
32. In traversing this flow path, the fuel mixture sustains very little
frictional or other energy losses. It is believed that this flow path
construction
optimizes the combustion process for the mixture enters the combustion
chamber thoroughly mixed, uniformly dispersed and completely vaporized.
Flow through the heating chamber is laminar. </p>
  <p>According to a feature of the invention, direct, uncontrolled heat
transfer
between the turbine housing 108 and the vaporizer 50 is inhibited by a
thermal isolator. In particular, referring to FIG. 3, a circular flange
200 including a plurality of apertures 202 and a centrally located
nipple
204 is suitably fastened to the inlet 120 of the turbine chamber 108. A
relatively short conduit 206 constructed from a material having a
relatively
low thermal conductivity is clamped to and extends between the
vaporizer
outlet 96 and the turbine inlet nipple 204 by suitable clamps (not
shown).
Preferably, the conduit 206 is constructed from an elastomeric material
and provides an added feature of the invention. </p>
  <p>Not only does the conduit 206 thermally isolate the vaporizer 50
from
the turbine housing 108 it also provides vibration isolation and
thereby
isolates the carburetor 38 from engine vibration that would otherwise
be
transmitted from the turbine housing 108 to the vaporizer 50. The heat
isolation provided by the conduit 206 prevents the uncontrolled heat
transfer
to the bowl of the carburetor 38 that could cause fuel percolation or
vapor
lock. Moreover, the vibration isolation provided by the preferred
conduit
construction should reduce the need for carburetor readjustment and
improve
the overall reliability and calibration of the fuel system. </p>
  <p>It should now be recognized that the present invention provides a
method
for operating an internal combustion engine that increases the overall
efficiency of the engine by optimizing the combustion process.
According
to the disclosed method, a controlled amount of liquid fuel, such as
gasoline,
is introduced into the intake system of an engine and mixed with a
controlled
amount of air to form a combustible mixture. The air and entrained fuel
are then heated by transferring heat from the engine coolant system, or
alternately from the engine exhaust system to encourage the
vaporization
of the liquid fuel. The mixture is then stirred and homogenized so that
the vapor is uniformly distributed throughout. </p>
  <p>The homogenized mixture is then further heated to increase the
overall
temperature of the fuel mixture well above the vaporization temperature
of liquid fuel. Preferably, the mixture is heated to at least twice the
vaporization temperature of the liquid fuel with the fuel air mixture
reaching
about 400.degree. F. in the mixture heater when the fuel is 93 octane
unleaded
gasoline. Movement of the fuel/air mixture is important to permit
mixture
temperatures of this magnitude without reaction. Mixture velocities in
the disclosed engine are such that the temperature should be kept below
440.degree. F. to avoid reaction of the mixture in the heating chamber.
It should be noted that the average vaporization temperature of
currently
available gasolines (at sea level) is approximately 110.degree. F. The
heating of the fuel mixture not only insures complete fuel vaporization
but it also adds energy to the fuel mixture that would otherwise be
lost
to the engine exhaust and cooling systems. In short, the fuel/air
mixture
enters the combustion chambers with a higher energy content. Since the
mixture has a higher energy content, less fuel is needed to produce the
desired temperature and pressure levels in the combustion chamber. </p>
  <p>In order to achieve the optimum energy output during combustion,
the
present invention also provides method steps for operating the engine
which
optimize the combustion process. By optimizing the energy output, it
has
been found that the amount of waste heat discharged through the engine
cooling system and otherwise is reduced thus contributing to the
reduction
in radiator size and fan elimination. </p>
  <p>According to these additional steps, the volume of the combustion
chamber
is held substantially constant at or near its minimum volume during the
combustion process so that the gases and products of the combustion
reaction
substantially reach their maximum temperature and pressure. The hot
gases
generated during this optimized combustion process are allowed to
expand
substantially at a constant volume at a time commencing before there is
any significant drop from the maximum temperature and pressure. In
order
to accomplish combustion optimization, the crank shaft stroke and
piston
rod length are selected so that the piston remains within 0.001" of
top-dead-center
(TDC) for about 13.degree. of crank shaft rotation or longer. </p>
  <p>The position of the wrist pin in the piston as well as the piston
radial
clearance have been found to affect piston "dwell time" at TDC. In
particular,
offsetting the wrist pin position to accommodate a longer rod length
increases
piston dwell. Increasing the piston radial clearance allows the piston
to "rock" and also increases piston dwell. </p>
  <p>This "piston dwell" parameter is determined by directly measuring
the
piston movement near TDC relative to crankshaft rotation, with the
engine
head removed, i.e., using a dial indicator. It will be recognized that
during engine operation, the actual piston dwell at TDC may be
different
than measured because, with pressure on top of the piston, relative
motions
of the moving parts may be somewhat different. However, it is believed
the difference, if any, is not significant and it is certain that top
center
dwell time is increased over conventional engines. It has been found
through
experience and experimentation, that sizing the piston stroke and rod
length
to arrive at the dwell measurements stated above, will produce the
desired
increase in combustion efficiency. Using this sizing criteria and
measurement
technique, an internal combustion engine utilizing gasoline for fuel
and
operating at a speed range of between 800 and 4,000 rpm, fuel
efficiency
as well as power output is substantially increased. </p>
  <p>Such an engine is more accurately termed an expander because the
piston
leaves TDC when pressure is essentially at its maximum so that
extraction
of power from the working fluid is maximized due to maximization of its
expansion. It is this expansion which results in a smooth vibration
free
operation without counter-weighting used by others to attempt to
approach
the smoothness of the engine disclosed here. </p>
  <p>An engine and fuel system embodying the present invention was
constructed
and installed in a 1980 Buick Skylark. The vehicle weighed 3,005 lbs,
two
passengers, full fuel accelerated 0-060 M.P.H. in 9.4 seconds. The
mechanical
parameters for the engine are listed in Table I. A measured torque
curve
is illustrated in FIG. 10 and indicates a remarkably level torque
output,
in excess of 225 ft-lbs, for an operating range of 2000-4400 rpm. Those
in the art will recognize that the disclosed power output for a
three-cylinder
engine having a displacement of 125 cubic inches and weighing only 320
lbs. in its operating mode including clutch and bell housing is
substantially
more than one would expect from an engine this size. Moreover, it was
found
that the engine was remarkably vibration free and the radiator with
which
the above identified vehicle was originally equipped was reduced in
size
and capacity by about 50%. </p>

  <p>In order to achieve the earlier discussed "piston dwell" of 0.001"
piston
movement at TDC for 13 degrees of crankshaft rotation, the wrist pin
position
is offset approximately 0.060" in the direction in which thrust is
applied
to the piston from the diametric center of the piston to accommodate a
rod length of 6.5". Additionally, a piston radial clearance of 0.006"
was
selected to provide a small amount of piston "rock" which adds to the
piston
dwell. The combined effects of the offset and clearance permit thrust
forces
to offset the piston as the rod connected crank journal passes over
dead
center resulting in a closer spacing of piston top to journal axis than
in the case with conventional construction. After the journal passes
dead
center the thrust forces are relieved and the piston centers itself.
This
centering action has a movement vector away from the journal and
therefore
it assists in maintaining the piston near top-dead-center. </p>
  <p>A mileage test for the vehicle was conducted using a 133 mile
driving
loop that included both city and highway speeds. The vehicle drive
train,
i.e., transmission, differential gearing, etc. was standard and
unmodified.
Slightly larger diameter, commonly available, tires were used in the
test.
With a final drive ratio of 2.3-1, the engine R.P.M. at 55 M.P.H. is
2,000.
The vehicle speed was maintained within 2 mph of the posted speed
limit.
One hour and forty minutes of the test was spent in city traffic and an
equal amount of time was spent in highway traffic. The 133 mile test
loop
was repeated 10 times and at the conclusion of the test it was found
that
the vehicle averaged 48.25 miles per gallon. The disclosed performance
gains in both fuel economy and power output were obtained without
sacrificing
driveability. </p>
  <p>It was also found that the engine was not prone to detonation even
under
high engine loads and low engine rpm. Moreover, the vehicle could be
smoothly
accelerated in high gear, from a road speed of 20 MPH, under both part
and full throttle, without evidence of engine hesitation or flutter.
The
constant downshifting to maintain sufficient engine RPM often required
with conventional, small displacement engines was found to be
unnecessary. </p>
  <p>It is believed that the apparatus and method disclosed by this
present
invention optimizes engine performance by controlling flame speed
during
combustion. This control is achieved by the thorough preparation and
mixing
of the fuel mixture prior to entry into the combustion chamber so that
the mixture inducted into the chamber is homogenous and burns at a
controlled
rate throughout the engine operating range. The heat energy contained
in
the engine coolant and exhaust systems is utilized in the preparation
process
and is added to the fuel mixture to increase its energy output. </p>
  <p>This is achieved by sizing and adjusting the coolant and exhaust
loops
to produce a "heat balance" wherein the engine heat normally discharged
to the ambient (by the exhaust and coolant systems) is conveyed to the
incoming fuel mixture to insure thorough mixing and vaporization. More
importantly, the heat loops are critically adjusted to produce heat
transfer
flow rates that are proportional to the power output of the engine.
Thus
as the output increases, the amount of heat transferred to the incoming
fuel mixture increases proportionately. In short, an internal
combustion
engine utilizing the present invention operates as a "hot vapor cycle"
engine. The apparatus disclosed, not only insures complete fuel
vaporization
and mixing but also heats the fuel vapor well above the vaporization
temperature
of the fuel. </p>
  <p>While it is believed the engine which has been described is, if
fine
tuned, fully capable of meeting present and contemplated EPA
regulations
a test engine was constructed in which the engine which has been
described
was fitted with mechanisms designed to provide exhaust gas
recirculation
(EGR) and intake air heating. These provisions are designed primarily
only
to meet so called "cold start" test requirements and, again, can be
eliminated
by fine tuning of the engine previously described. </p>
  <p>A modified homogenizer 210 is provided. The homogenizer 210 has an
outer
housing 212 which defines an air passage 213 between the homogenizer
housing
212 and an exhaust gas and turbine surrounding housing 214. </p>
  <p>The homogenizer housing 212 includes a pair of air inlet passages
216.
The air inlet passages 216 are positioned on opposite sides of
homogenizer
connection to the exhaust conduit 132 to entrain ambient air for
heating
as it passes through the air passage 213. </p>
  <p>The homogenizer includes a heated air outlet 218 which is opposite
the
exhaust conduit 132 so that the distance from each of the two inlets
216
to the common outlet 218 is equal. Air which has been warmed by the
homogenizer
passes through the outlet 218 thence through a connected air conducting
conduit 219 to a carburetor air intake manifold 220. The carburetor air
intake manifold 220 has an ambient air intake 222 through which
unheated
ambient air can pass to be delivered to the carburetor. </p>
  <p>A temperature responsive air intake control valve 224 modulates
the
supply of ambient air through the passage 222. Normally on startup the
intake valve 224 remains in a closed condition so the only air supplied
to the carburetor is air preheated by passage through the air heating
passage
213. Once this air reaches that desired temperature of about
110.degree.
F. the valve will open. If the engine is operating in cool or cold
climates
the intake valve will modulate to maintain intake air temperature of
about
110.degree. F. during normal operating conditions. </p>
  <p>On occasion, as an example during acceleration, air supplied
through
the air passage 213 and the air conduit 219 may not be adequate for
operating
conditions. Accordingly the intake valve 224 is also vacuum sensitive
and
when engine manifold pressure drops below 4 inches the intake valve
opens
to allow additional ambient air to be entrained into the carburetor
through
the intake passage 222 and the carburetor air intake manifold 20. </p>
  <p>An EGR conduit 226 is provided, FIG. 11. This EGR 226 conducts
exhaust
gasses from the outlet side of the homogenizer to the inlet side of the
chamber in which the compressor turbine 102 is located. This assures
that
recirculated exhaust gasses are thoroughly admixed with the fuel air
mixture
supplied to the engine and that such recirculated exhaust gasses are
equally
distributed to each of the reaction chambers. </p>
  <p>The EGR conduit 226 is shown only schematically in FIG. 11. In
practice,
the connection of the EGR conduit 226 to the fuel air conducting
conduit
206 or the compressor turbine housing 108 is located such that EGR
fluids
are directed toward the compressor chamber. The axis of the EGR inlet
is
an angle of less than 45.degree. with the axis of the fuel air conduit
206 and the two axes are located in a common plane which includes the
axis
of the turbine 102. </p>
  <p>The configuration of the compressor turbine housing and its mating
with
the compressor turbine is best illustrated in FIG. 11. The housing 108
includes an outlet opening 208 in a portion of the housing which fits
closely
with the compressor turbine 102. The outlet provides a constricting
orifice
for assisting in isolating th vaporizer 50 from low manifold pressures.
In the test engine used to produce the test data presented previously,
the compressor turbine was 2.2 inches in diameter. The outlet 208 was
one
inch in diameter and was followed downstream by housing walls of a
frusto
conical shaped contour. These housing walls flare from the one inch
outlet
opening 208 to a two inch diameter in an axial length of one inch.
Thereafter
the outer side walls of the two outer flow paths 152a flare outwardly
at
8.degree. or less within the interior of fuel mixture heater 152. </p>
  <p>Although the invention has been described with a certain degree of
particularity,
it is understood that various changes can be made to it by those
skilled
in the art without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention
as described and hereinafter claimed. </p>
