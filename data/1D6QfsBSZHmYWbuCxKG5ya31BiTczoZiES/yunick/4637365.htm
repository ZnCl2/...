  <p><b>Description</b> </p>
  <p><b>TECHNICAL FIELD</b> </p>
  <p>The present invention relates generally to internal combustion
engines
and in particular to method and apparatus for vaporizing and heating a
liquid fuel prior to entry into a combustion chamber of an internal
combustion
engine. </p>
  <p><b>BACKGROUND ART</b> </p>
  <p>In many conventional gasoline engines, particularly those used in
automotive
applications, a carburetor mounted atop an intake manifold forms a
principle
component of a fuel system. As is well known, combustion air is drawn
through
the carburetor. A controlled amount of gasoline is added to the
incoming
air to form a combustible fuel/air mixture, as the air passes through a
venturi throat formed in the carburetor. The intake manifold, which
includes
passages that communicate with valve controlled intake ports in the
cylinder
head of the engine, conveys and distributes the fuel/air mixture from
the
carburetor to the combustion chambers. </p>
  <p>In theory, the liquid gasoline is vaporized prior to entering the
combustion
chambers. In a typical IC engine application, however, a portion of the
gasoline remains unvaporized and in a liquid state even as it enters
the
combustion chamber, finally vaporizing during the combustion process.
The
presence of unvaporized fuel in the combustion chamber reduces the heat
of combustion, thus limiting the power output of the engine. In the
parent
case an apparatus and method for operating an internal combustion
engine
is disclosed. The illustrated apparatus and described method provides a
means for recovering a substantial amount of heat which in more
conventional
IC engines is exhausted as waste. This recovered heat is used to
vaporize
the liquid fuel and to superheat the fuel/air mixture. The illustrated
apparatus includes a fuel introducing device such as a carburetor, a
vaporizer
for at least partially vaporizing the liquid fuel discharged by the
carburetor
and a fuel mixture heater for heating the fuel/air mixture prior to
introduction
into combustion chambers. An exhaust driven homogenizer is disposed in
the fuel mixture flow path intermediate the vaporizer and the fuel
mixture
heater. The homogenizer is operative to thoroughly mix and homogenize
the
mixture and also pressurizes and adds additonal heat to it. </p>
  <p>As disclosed in the parent case, the fuel vaporizer comprises a
housing
defining an internal chamber. The walls of the housing includes
passages
through which engine coolant is passed in order to heat the enclosed
chamber.
In operation, heat from the coolant is transferred via the chamber
walls
to the fuel passing through the chamber. The disclosed construction
works
satisfactorily; however, improvements in the heating efficiency and
overall
performance are always desired. For example, it is believed that after
engine shutdown, as the vaporizer chamber cools, any vaporized fuel in
the flow path condenses and collects at the base of the chamber. Upon
startup,
the collected fuel appears to be immediately ingested by the engine and
may cause an overrich running condition for a time which is
undesirable. </p>
  <p><b>DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
  <p>The present invention provides a new and improved method and
apparatus
for vaporizing a liquid fuel and heating a fuel mixture prior to
introduction
into an engine combustion chamber. In addition, the present invention
provides
a means for collecting and holding fuel condensate after engine
shutdown. </p>
  <p>According to the invention, a fuel charge forming apparatus is
disclosed
which includes a high efficiency fuel vaporizer for at least partially
vaporizing fuel discharged by a fuel introducing device such as a
carburetor.
The vaporizer is disposed in a flow path defined between the carburetor
and combustion chambers of an IC engine. The flow path communicates
with
each combustion chamber through an associated valve controlled port. </p>
  <p>In addition to the fuel vaporizer, the flow path includes a fuel
mixture
heater and a fuel mixture homogenizer disposed between the vaporizer
and
heater. As more fully disclosed in the related earlier applications,
the
homogenizer thoroughly mixes the fuel/air mixture. The homogenizer
contributes
significantly to the full vaporization of the fuel. It is believed
heavier
constituents of the fuel are broken up by being centrifugally flung
against
hot walls of the homogenizer that are heated to about 300.degree. F.
This
stops the "fall out" of heavier ends causing them to mix with lighter
fuel
constituents and resulting in total fuel vaporization. The fuel mixture
heater adds significant heat to the fuel/air mixture to "super heat"
the
fuel/air mixture prior to introduction into the combustion chambers. </p>
  <p>In the preferred embodiment, the fuel vaporizer includes a housing
defining
a chamber through which the fuel mixture passes on its way to the
homogenizer.
The housing mounts a highly efficient heat exchange member which
transfers
waste heat from the engine to the incoming fuel mixture. The waste heat
can be furnished by the engine exhaust or coolant systems or both. In
the
exemplary embodiment, the heat exchange member receives heat from the
engine
coolant system. The heat exchange member comprises a supply tube
defining
an isolated flow path for engine coolant and a plurality of heat
exchange
surfaces extending from the tube. The surfaces are defined by a
plurality
of bristles or spines constructed from a material having good heat
transfer
properties such as aluminum. Preferably, the bristles extend radially
from
the heat exchange coolant tube. In the preferred embodiment, the
coolant
tube is also constructed of a material having good thermal conductivity
such as aluminum or copper. </p>
  <p>According to the invention, the housing defines an inlet for a
heat
exchange medium, such as engine coolant and an outlet for discharging
the
medium after passing through at least a portion of the housing. The
inner
chamber is defined by side walls and a bottom wall spaced from inner
surfaces
of wall structure that defines the outer housing. The gap defined
between
the outer housing and the inner chamber forms a fluid jacket through
which
the heat exchange medium flows, transferring heat to the inner chamber.
  </p>
  <p>In the preferred and illustrated embodiment, the housing defines a
mounting
plate to which the fuel introducing device, i.e., the carburetor is
mounted.
The mounting plate defines an inlet to the chamber through which air
and
entrained fuel is admitted as it is discharged by the carburetor. The
inner
chamber also includes an outlet through which the vaporized fuel
mixture
is discharged which, in the illustrated embodiment, is connected to the
fuel mixture homogenizer by a suitable conduit. </p>
  <p>In the preferred construction, the chamber inlet and chamber
outlet
are oriented at substantially 90.degree. to each other. With this, the
air and entrained fuel discharged by the carburetor travels downwardly
and impinges on the floor of the inner chamber which is heated by the
heat
exchange medium flowing in the fluid jacket. </p>
  <p>According to the invention, at least one but preferably two heat
exchange
members are located in the vaporizing chamber on either side of the
inlet
opening and are disposed generally normal to the fuel/air flow path
from
the inlet to the chamber outlet. The heat exchange members are
positioned
in regions of the chamber which are outside the area of the chamber
outlet
so that only a small portion of the periphery of each heat exchange
member
can be seen when looking directly into the chamber outlet of the
vaporizer.
With this construction, the heat exchange members do not present any
appreciable
obstruction in a flow path defined between the chamber inlet and the
chamber
outlet. </p>
  <p>As indicated above, in the preferred construction, the air and
entrained
fuel to be vaporized enters the chamber inlet and impinges on the
heated
floor of the chamber. The heat added to the fuel causes the fuel to
expand
reducing its velocity and increasing its pressure. This causes at least
a portion of the fuel mixture to travel towards the heat exchange
members
and circulate around the members and through the bristle-like heat
exchange
surfaces before exiting the chamber through the chamber outlet. With
the
disclosed construction, relatively high heat exchange rates between the
heat exchange medium and the fuel mixture can be achieved without
significantly
impeding the fuel mixture flow. </p>
  <p>According to a feature of the invention, the disclosed vaporizer
inhibits
fuel condensate, accumulated after engine shutdown, from being
immediately
drawn into the engine upon start-up. It is believed that the bristles
or
spines of the heat exchange members, because they are small and heated
at but one end, cool more quickly than the walls of the chamber and
collect
droplets of fuel as the fuel condenses during cool down. These bristles
also are believed to hold the condensate during initial start-up,
whether
it be a so-called hot or cold start-up. The condensate is then
gradually
drawn or metered into the engine over a period of time. As a result, an
overrich condition is not generated during engine start-up due to the
accumulation
of condensate in the chamber after engine shutdown. </p>
  <p>Further, in the case of a cold start-up a longer time will elapse
before
condensate vaporization occurs than is the case with a hot start-up. As
the engine warms, choke produced richness is cut off, while in about
the
same time frame, the spines begin to vaporize condensate and enrich the
fuel/air mixture flowing to the homogenizer. The effect is a more
linear
decrease in cold start fuel/air enrichment from full choke at the
initial
start-up to the mixture provided at normal engine temperature. </p>
  <p>The present invention provides a highly efficient fuel vaporizing
apparatus
which is both inexpensive and effective. The use of a heat exchange
member
having a plurality of bristle-like heat exchange surfaces not only
increases
the heat exchange rate between the engine coolant and the fuel mixture
but also acts as an accumulator for fuel condensate when the engine is
turned off. </p>
  <p>Additional features of the invention will become apparent and a
fuller
understanding obtained by reading the following detailed description
made
in connection with the accompanying drawings. </p>

  <p><b>BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</b> </p>
  <p>FIG. 1 schematically illustrates an automobile engine system
including
a fuel conditioning apparatus for transferring waste heat exhausted by
the engine to the incoming fuel mixture. A complete and thorough
explanation
of the system can be found in related U.S. application No. 622,409,
filed
June 22, 1984 which is hereby incorporated by reference. By way of
summary,
the fuel conditioning apparatus is connected to an internal combustion
engine 20 which in the illustrated embodiment includes three cylinders
22, formed in an engine block 24, each cylinder 22 including an
associated
piston 26. The pistons 26 are operatively connected to a crankshaft
(not
shown) by connecting rods in the conventional manner so that reciprocal
movement in the pistons 26 produces rotary motion in the crankshaft. </p>
  <p>A cylinder head 30 is suitably fastened to the top of the engine
block
24 and defines a combustion chamber (not shown) in each cylinder 22.
The
inflow of fuel/air mixture into each combustion chamber and the outflow
of combustion products is controlled by a suitable valve mechanism such
as conventional cam driven poppet valves (not shown). </p>
  <p>The fuel mixture flow path extends between the cylinders 22 and a
fuel
introducing device 38 such as a carburetor. Liquid fuel is delivered to
the carburetor 38 from a fuel tank 40 by a conventional fuel pump 42
and
associated conduits 44. The carburetor 38 preferably operates in a
conventional
manner and combines controlled amounts of air and liquid fuel to form a
combustible fuel mixture. </p>
  <p>In general, only a portion of the liquid fuel will be vaporized in
a
throat of the carburetor as it enters the air flow stream. A fuel
mixture
vaporizer 50 and a fuel mixture heating device 52 are disposed in and
preferably
form part of the fuel mixture flow path and transfer heat to the
incoming
fuel mixture to insure complete vaporization. Preferably, the fuel
mixture
is heated to a temperature above the vaporization temperature of the
liquid
fuel, preferably to a temperature which is twice the vaporization
temperature
of the fuel. A fuel mixture homogenizer, indicated generally by the
reference
character 54, is disposed in the flow path intermediate the vaporizer
50
and the heating device 52. </p>
  <p>In the illustrated embodiment, both the fuel mixture heater 52 and
the
homogenizer 54 receive heat from the engine exhaust gases and transfer
this otherwise waste heat to the fuel mixture. The path of exhaust gas
flow to the fuel/air mixture heater 52 and the homogenizer 54 is shown
schematically in FIG. 1. An exhaust conduit 132 extends into fluid
communication
with a plurality of exhaust ports (not shown) formed in the cylinder
head
30 through three branch conduits 174. The conduit 132 forms an exhaust
manifold connected, at its left end, to a transfer conduit 184 which
includes
a valve 186. The transfer conduit 184 communicates exhaust gas from the
intake manifold 132 to the fuel mixture heater 52. The right end (as
viewed
in FIG. 1) exends into fluid communication with a turbine housing 110
of
the homogenizer 54 as well as the fuel mixtue heater 52. A valve 188
controls
the exhaust flow from the right end of the conduit 132. </p>
  <p>The valves 186, 188 are used to adjust the exhaust flow in the
respective
conduits. The valve 186 controls the amount of exhaust gases
communicated
to the fuel mixture heater 52. By properly adjusting the respective
valves,
a heat balance is obtained wherein the exhaust gas conveyed to the
heater
52 will deliver the requisite amount of heat to the fuel mixture, the
heat
delivered being a function of the power output of the engine. The
exhaust
gas communicated to the turbine housing 110 causes rotation of the
exhaust
turbine 104. The turbine 104 is connected to a homogenizer turbine 102
by a common shaft 106 such that rotation of the exhaust turbine 104
produces
concurrent rotation in the homogenizer turbine 102 located in an
associated
turbine housing 108. The rotation of the turbine 102 mixes and
homogenizes
the fuel mixture traveling to the engine prior to introduction into the
combustion chambers. </p>
  <p>The three components, namely the vaporizer 50, the homogenizer 54
and
the fuel mixture heater 52 all contribute to the complete vaporization
and heating of the fuel mixture prior to entering the combustion
chambers.
The three stage fuel mixture preparation provided by the disclosed
apparatus
insures virtually complete fuel vaporization. It has been found that
heat
alone will not fully vaporize a liquid fuel. Simple heating will simply
vaporize the volatile fuel components leaving behind an unvaporized
residue.
The present invention achieves virtually complete vaporization by not
relying
solely on heat. Instead, the apparatus both heats and homogenizes the
mixture
to disperse or break up the heavier components, preventing the
"fallout"
of these heavier components. In particular, the centrifugal force
imparted
to the fuel mixture by the homogenizer turbine 108, causes the heavier
constituents to be flung against the hot walls of the homogenizer
housing
thus breaking these heavier constituents into even smaller particles. </p>
  <p>As discussed, the vaporizer 50, the homogenizer 54 and the super
heater
52 each contribute to the heating of the fuel mixture. It has been
found
that for commercially available and commonly used gasoline, the
disclosed
apparatus raises the fuel mixture temperature to approximately
300.degree.-450.degree.
F. prior to introduction into the combustion chambers. The contribution
of each of these devices is as follows. The vaporizer 50 raises the
fuel
mixture temperature to approximately 150.degree.-200.degree. F. The
homogenizer
raises the temperature to approximately 200.degree.-300.degree. F. and
the fuel mixture heater 52 raises the final temperature of the fuel
mixture
to approximately 300.degree.-450.degree. F. </p>
  <p>It must be noted that the above temperature ranges are those
obtained
when using currently available gasoline. When using other fuels having
different vaporization temperatures, the heat ranges will be adjusted
proportionately.
In the case of diesel fuel, which has a much higher vaporization
temperature
than gasoline, significantly higher temperature ranges would be
reached.
In the disclosed apparatus the source of heat for the vaporizer 50 is
the
engine coolant which limits the availabe source temperature to around
200.degree.
F. When a higher temperature is needed for the vaporizer, exhaust gases
would be used as a source of heat so that the fuel mixture could be
heated
to substantially more than 200.degree. F. by the vaporizer. In summary,
the heating achieved by the vaporizer 50, homogenizer 54 and mixture
heater
52 are determined by the application and the available energy. The
ranges
are adjusted as needed and are determined, in part, by the fuel being
used. </p>
  <p>The present invention discloses a vaporizer construction for
enhancing
the vaporization of the fuel discharged by the carburetor 38. The
construction
of the vaporizer is illustrated in FIGS. 2-5. The vaporizer 50 includes
an outer housing 60 defining an inlet opening 62 for receiving the fuel
mixture to be vaporized from the carburetor 38 and an outlet 64 through
which the vaporized fuel mixture exits. As seen in FIG. 1, the fuel
mixture
leaves the vaporizer 50 and is conveyed to the homogenizer 54 by a
suitable
passage or conduit 66. The housing 60 also defines inlet and outlet
fittings
70, 72 for receiving and discharging a heat exchange medium. In the
illustrated
embodiment, the heat exchange medium comprises engine coolant which, in
more conventional automobile engine systems, receives heat from the
engine
block and engine head and discharges it to atmosphere by way of a
radiator
(not shown). With the present invention, the heat absorbed by the
coolant
is conveyed to the vaporizer and is transferred to the fuel mixture. </p>
  <p>The outer housing includes integral mounting pads 74 by which the
vaporizer
is mounted in a vehicle. In the illustrated construction, a carburetor
mounting plate 76 is defined by the housing and surrounds the inlet 62.
The plate includes a plurality of threaded bores 78 which are adapted
to
receive mounting bolts for clamping the base of the carburetor to the
mounting
plate. As is known in the art, a gasket or other seal arrangement is
normally
used between the carburetor and mounting plate to seal the area from
atmosphere. </p>
  <p>The vaporizer 50 includes an inner chamber 80 defined by side
walls
82, 84 and a bottom plate 86. As seen best in FIG. 2, a coolant jacket
is defined between the inner chamber 80 and external housing 60. In
particular,
coolant receiving gaps are defined between the inner walls 82, 84 and a
wall 60a of the external housing as well as between the bottom wall 86
of the inner chamber and a bottom wall 60b of the external housing. The
gaps form a fluid jacket 88 surrounding the inner chamber 80. In normal
operation, engine coolant communicated to this jacket via the inlet 70
heats the inner chamber by conduction through the side walls 82, 84 and
the bottom wall 86. </p>
  <p>In accordance with the invention, a heat exchange member having
bristle
or spine-like fins is disposed within the inner chamber 80. During
operation,
the heat exchange member is in a heat exchange relationship with the
fuel
mixture communicated to the inner chamber 80. As seen best in FIGS. 2
and
4, in the preferred construction, two heat exchange members 90 are
disposed
in the inner chamber and are oriented such that they are parallel to an
axis 92 of the vaporizer outlet 64. Each heat exchange member comprises
a supply tube 94 (shown best in FIG. 2) which is surrounded by a
plurality
of heat exchange spine-like fins 94a. The heat exchanger surfaces
defined
by the fins 94a radiate radially from the supply tube 94. As seen in
FIG.
2, the supply tubes 94 are in fluid communication with the the coolant
jacket 88 that surrounds the inner chamber 80. It should be noted that
a lower jacket portion 88a (as viewed in FIG. 1) communicates with the
inlet 70. An upper jacket portion 88b (as viewed in FIG. 1)
communicates
with the outlet 72. The heat supply tubes 94 of the heat exchange
members
span the inner chamber 80 with one end of the supply tubes
communicating
with the lower portion 88a of the jacket 88 and an upper end of the
tubes
communicating with the upper jacket portion 88b. Consequently, at least
a portion of the coolant communicated to the vaporizer travels from the
inlet 70 through the supply tubes 94 and then is discharged by the
outlet
72. </p>
  <p>As seen in FIG. 2, the heat exchange members are disposed outside
the
periphery of the inlet 62 and as seen in FIG. 3, only a small
peripheral
portion 95 of the spine-like fins 94a can be seen from the vaporizer
outlet
64. With this construction, the members 90 do not present a substantial
obstruction to the fuel mixture flow which would reduce the efficiency
of the fuel induction system. </p>
  <p>In the preferred and illustrated embodiment, the members 90 are
located
in regions 80a of the chamber 80. The regions 80a are located to the
sides
of a region of the inner chamber 80 that defines a 90.degree. flow path
between the inlet 62 and the outlet 64. </p>
  <p>During normal operation, it is believed that the vaporizer
operates
as follows. Partially vaporized fuel and air are discharged by the
carburetor
38 into the vaporizer 50 via the inlet 62. The fuel mixture travels
downwardly
(as viewed in FIG. 3) and strikes the heated bottom wall 86 of the
inner
chamber 80. The heat transferred to the fuel mixture causes the fuel to
vaporize and expand thus decreasing its overall velocity and increasing
its pressure. This causes at least a portion of the fuel mixture to
travel
around the heat exchange members 90 prior to leaving the vaporizer by
way
of the outlet 64. As the fuel mixture travels around the heat exchange
members, additional heat is transferred to the fuel mixture from the
supply
tubes 94 and spine-like fins 94a causing further vaporization and
heating
of the fuel. </p>
  <p>The spine-like fins 94a that radiate from the supply tubes 94
present
highly efficient heat exchange surfaces without causing undue
obstruction
to the flow. It is believed that relatively high heat exchange rates
are
achievable with this constructions as compared to more conventional fin
constructions which usually comprise large, continuous heat exchange
surfaces.
With these prior constructions, obstructions to fuel mixture flow were
encountered and therefore the heat exchange between the heat exchange
medium
and the fuel mixture was less efficient. </p>
  <p>It should be noted that, in order for the fuel conditioning system
shown
in FIG. 1 to operate properly, the fuel must be sufficiently vaporized
by the fuel vaporizer 50 prior to introduction into the homogenizer. If
excessive, raw unvaporized fuel is allowed to enter the homogenizer and
fuel mixture heater, the efficiency of the engine will be reduced
because
the fuel mixture will not be sufficiently heated when it enters the
combustion
chamber. As fully described in the above identified related U.S.
application,
if the fuel is not properly heated, performance in the engine will be
degraded. </p>
  <p>Additionally, the vaporizer reduces or minimizes the need for a
radiator
for transferring engine waste heat from the engine coolant to
atmosphere.
Ideally, the radiator can be eliminated if all of the waste heat is
transferred
entirely to the incoming fuel mixture. It is therefore imperative that
the fuel vaporizer 50 be as efficient as possible in order to achieve a
heat exchange rate at which substantial portions of the engine waste
heat
are transferred from the engine coolant to the fuel mixture. The
construction
of the vaporizer disclosed by the present invention minimizes the need
for a radiator and cooling fan. </p>
  <p>The illustrated heat exchange members can be formed from a
commercially
available product. Sources for this product include the Trane Company
of
Tyler, Tex., and Carrier Corporation of Syracuse, N.Y. It has been
found
that, for the vaporizer 50 illustrated in FIGS. 1-4, a heat exchange
tube
94 measuring approximately 43/4" in length provided satisfactory
results.
The inner diameter of the supply tube 94 for this experimental
vaporizer
was approximately 0.44" and the overall diameter including the
spine-like
fins or bristles was approximately 1.38". </p>
  <p>The use of the disclosed heat exchange members 90 having the
bristle-like
heat exchange fins 94 provides an added feature of the invention. When
the engine 20 is shut down, the fuel in the vaporizer 50 eventually
condenses
as the vaporizer cools. Absent the heat exchange members, this liquid
fuel
is drawn into the engine immediately upon start-up. It was found that
this
inrush of raw fuel produced an overrich condition in the engine at
start-up. </p>
  <p>With the use of the heat exchange members 90, this overrich
condition
is at least partially alleviated. In operation, when the engine is shut
down the fuel condenses on the bristles. It has been found that the
droplets
of fuel condensate are held by the bristles and are prevented from
immediately
being drawn into the engine upon start-up. In fact, it is believed that
the bristles in effect meter the inflow of fuel concentrate after
start-up
so that the overrich condition described above is reduced or
eliminated. </p>
  <p>Although various construction methods can be used to assemble the
vaporizer
50, in the illustrated construction, apertures for the heat exchange
tubes
94 are drilled into the inner sidewalls 84. In order to obtain access
to
the inner wall, clearance openings 110 are drilled through the external
housing 60. In order to assemble the vaporizer, the heat exchange
members
are inserted in their proper locations inside the inner chamber prior
to
securing the inner chamber bottom wall 86 and the bottom plate 60b of
the
housing 60. The supply tubes 94 are secured to the inner walls 84 by
welding
or other suitable process such as adhesive bonding. After the tubes are
secured inside the inner chamber 80, the access holes 110 drilled in
the
outer housing 60 are sealed by plugs 112. The bottom plates 86, 60b are
then secured to the bottom of the inner chamber 80 and outer housing
60,
respectively. It should be apparent that other methods can be employed
to form the disclosed vaporizer. The entire housing may be cast or
stamped
from various materials and in fact, the inner chamber walls and outer
housing
may be formed by diverse materials. Since it is desired to have maximum
heat flow into the inner chamber 80, in the preferred embodiment, the
inner
chamber walls are constructed of a heat conductive material, such as
aluminum.
The outer housing may be constructed of a heat insulating material to
minimize
heat loss from the coolant to ambient. </p>
  <p>Although the invention has been described with a certain degree of
particularity,
it should be understood that those skilled in the art can make various
changes to it without departing from the spirit or scope of the
invention
as hereinafter claimed. </p>
