              Reign of Law</i></font></b> </p>
      <p>(1900, Macmillan Co., London)</p>
    </center>
    <blockquote>&nbsp; <br>
      <b>James L. Allen</b> paid an eloquent tribute to the life of a
      hemp farmer in <i>The Reign of Law: A Tale of the Kentucky Hemp
        Fields</i> (1900), a novel --- printed on hemp paper ---
      revolving around the Bible and hemp husbandry. The following
      excerpt of his proesy describes a year in the life of a hemp
      field:
      <p>The Anglo-Saxon farmers had scarce conquered foothold,
        stronghold, freehold in the Western wilderness before they
        became sowers of hemp --- with remembrance of Virginia, with
        remembrance of dear ancestral Britain... The roads of Kentucky,
        those long limestone turnpikes connecting the towns and villages
        with the farms --- they were early made necessary by the hauling
        of hemp. For the sake of it slaves were perpetually being
        trained, hired, bartered; lands perpetually rented and sold;
        fortunes made or lost... </p>
      <p>With the Civil War began the long decline, lasting still. The
        record stands that throughout the one hundred and twenty-five
        odd years elapsing from the entrance of the Anglo-Saxon farmers
        into the wilderness down to the present time,&nbsp; a few
        counties of Kentucky have furnished army and navy, the entire
        country, with all but a small part of the native hemp consumed.
        Little comparatively is cultivated in Kentucky now. The traveler
        may still see it here and there, self-renewing inexhaustible
        fields. But the time cannot be far distant when the industry
        there will have become extinct. Its place in the nation's
        markets will be still further taken by metals, by other fibres,
        by finer varieties of the same fibre, by the same variety
        cultivated in soils less valuable. The history of it in Kentucky
        will be ended, and, being ended, lost... </p>
      <p>Warm they must be, those fields, its chosen birthplace.
        Upturned by the plough, crossed and recrossed by the harrow,
        clodless, leveled, deep, fine, fertile --- some extinct river
        bottom, some valley threaded by streams, some table-land of mild
        rays --- such is the favorite cradle of the hemp in Nature. Back
        and forth with measured tread, with measured distance, broadcast
        the sower sows, scattering with plenteous hand those small
        oval-shaped fruits, gray-green, black-striped, heavily packed
        with living marrow. </p>
      <p>Lightly covered by drag or harrow, under the rolled earth now
        they lie, those mighty, those inert seeds. Down into the
        darkness about them the sun rays penetrate day by day, stroking
        them with the brushes of light, prodding them with spears of
        flame. Drops of nightly dews, drops from the coursing clouds,
        trickle down to them, moistening the dryness, closing up the
        little hollows of the ground, drawing the particles of maternal
        earth more closely. Suddenly --- as an insect that has been
        feigning death cautiously unrolls itself and starts into action
        --- in each seed the great miracle of life begins. Each awakens
        as from a sleep, as from a pretended death. It starts, it moves,
        it bursts its ashen woody shell, it takes two opposite courses,
        the white fibril-tapered root hurrying away from the sun; the
        tiny stem, bearing its lance-like leaves, ascending gracefully,
        brave like a palm. </p>
      <p>Some morning, not many days later, the farmer, walking out into
        his barn lot and casting a look in the direction of his field,
        sees --- or does he not see? --- the surface of it less dark.
        What is that uncertain flush low on the ground, that
        irresistible rush of multitudinous green? A fortnight, and the
        field is brown no longer. Overflowing it, burying it out of
        sight, is the shallow tidal sea of the hemp, ever rippling... </p>
      <p>Darker, always darker turns the hemp as it rushes upward:
        scarce darker as to the stemless stalks which are hidden now;
        but darker in the tops. Yet here two shades of greenness: the
        male plants paler, smaller, maturing earlier, dying first; the
        females darker, taller, living longer, more luxuriant of foliage
        and flowering heads. </p>
      <p>A hundred days from the sowing, and those flowering heads have
        come forth with their mass of leaves and bloom and earliest
        fruits, elastic, swaying six, ten, twelve feet from the ground
        and ripe for cutting... And now, borne far through the steaming
        air floats an odor, balsamic, startling: the odor which is
        exuding freely the narcotic resin of the great nettle. The
        nostril expands quickly, the lungs swell out deeply to draw it
        in: fragrance once known in childhood, ever in the memory
        afterward. And able to bring back to the wanderer homesick
        thoughts of midsummer days in the shadowy, many-toned woods,
        over into which is blown the smell of the hemp-fields. </p>
      <p>Who apparently could number the acres of these in days gone by?
        A land of&nbsp; hemp, ready for the cutting! </p>
      <p>Impenetrable! For close together stand the stalks, making
        common cause for soil and light, each but one of many, the fibre
        being better when so grown --- as is also the fibre of men.
        Impenetrable and therefore weedless; for no plant life can
        flourish here, nor nor animal nor bird. Scarce a beetle runs
        bewilderingly through these colossal solitudes. The
        field-sparrow will flutter away from pollen-bearing to
        pollen-receiving top, trying to beguile you from its nest hidden
        near the edge. The crow and the blackbird will seem to love it,
        having a keen eye for the cutworm, its only enemy. The quail
        does love it, not for itself, but for its protection, leading
        her brood into its labyrinths out of the dusty road when danger
        draws near. Best of all winged creatures it is loved by the
        iris-eyed, burnish-breasted, murmuring doves, already beginning
        to gather in the deadened tree-tops with crops eager for the
        seed. Well remembered also by the long-flighted passenger
        pigeon, coming into the land from the mast. Best of all wild
        things whose safety lies not in the wing but in the foot, it is
        loved by the hare for its young, for its refuge... </p>
      <p>A hundred days to liftout of those tiny seed these powerful
        stalks, hollow, hairy, covered with their tough fibre --- that
        strength of cables when the big ships are tugged at by the
        joined fury of wind and ocean. And now some morning at the
        corner of the field stand the black men with hooks and
        whetstones. The hook, a keen, straight blade, bent at right
        angles to the handle two feet from the hand. Let these men be
        the strongest; no weakling can handle the hemp from seed to seed
        again... the leader strides to the edge, and throwing forward
        his left arm, along which the muscles play, he grasps as much as
        it will embrace, bends the stalks over, and with his right hand
        draws the blade through them an inch or more from the ground.
        When he has gathered his armful, he turns and flings it down
        behind him, so that it lies spread out, covering when fallen the
        same space it filled while standing. And so he crosses the broad
        acres, and so each of the big black followers, stepping one by
        one to a place behind him, until the long, wavering, whitish
        green swaths of the prostrate hemp lie shimmering across the
        fields. Strongest now the smell of it, impregnating the clothing
        of the men, spreading far throughout the air. </p>
      <p>So it lies a week or more drying, till the sap is out of the
        stalks, till leaves and blossoms and earliest ripened or
        unripened fruits wither and drop off, giving back to the soil
        the nourishment they have drawn from it; the whole top being
        otherwise wasted --- that part of the hemp which every year the
        dreamy millions of the Orient still consume in quantities beyond
        human computation, and for the love of which the very history of
        this plant is lost in the antiquity of India and Persia, its
        home --- land of narcotics and desires and dreams. </p>
      <p>Then the rakers with enormous wooden rakes; they draw the
        stalks into bundles, tying each with the hemp itself. Following
        the binders, move the wagon-beds or slides, gathering the
        bundles and carrying them to where huge, flat, and round, the
        stacks begin to rise. At last these are well built; the gates of
        the field are closed or the bars put up; the wagon and laborers
        are gone; the brown fields stand deserted... </p>
      <p>But of all that the earth has yielded with or without the
        farmer's help, of all that he can call his own within the limits
        of his land, nothing pleases him better than those still, brown
        fields where the shapely stacks stand amid the deadened trees.
        Two months have passed, the workmen are at it again. The stacks
        are torn down, the bundles scattered, the hemp spread out as
        before. There to lie till it shall be dew-retted or rotted;
        there to suffer freeze and thaw, chill rains, locking frosts and
        loosening snows --- all the action of the elements --- until the
        gums holding together the filaments of the fibre rot out and
        dissolve, until the bast be separated from the woody portion of
        the stalk, and the stalk itself be decayed and easily broken. </p>
      <p>Some day you walk across the spread hemp, your foot goes
        through at each step, you stoop and taking several stalks, snap
        them readily in your fingers. The ends stick out clean apart;
        and lo! Hanging between them, there it is at last --- a festoon
        of wet, coarse, dark gray riband, wealth of the hemp, sail of
        the wild Scythian centuries before Horace ever sang of him; sail
        of the Roman, dress of the Saxon and Celt, dress of the Kentucky
        pioneer. </p>
      <p>The rakers reappear at intervals of dry weather, and draw the
        hemp into armfuls and set it up in shocks of convenient size,
        wide flared at the bottom, well pressed in and bound at the top,
        so that the slanting sides may catch the dying sun and the
        sturdy base resist the strong winds. And now the fields are as
        the dark brown camp of armies --- each shock a soldier's tent.
        Yet not dark always; at times snow-covered; and then the white
        tents glean for miles in the winter sunshine --- the snow-white
        tents of the camping hemp. </p>
      <p>Throughout the winter and on into early spring, as days may be
        warm or the hemp dry, the breaking continues. At each nightfall,
        cleaned and bales, it is hauled on wagon-beds or slides to the
        barns or the hemphouses, where it is weighed for the work and
        wages of the day. </p>
      <p>Last of all, the brakes having been taken from the field, some
        night --- dear sport for the lads! --- takes place the burning
        of the hempherds, thus returning their elements to the soil. To
        kindle a handful of tow and fling it as a firebrand into one of
        those masses of tinder; to see the flames spread and the sparks
        rush like swarms of red bees skyward through the smoke into the
        awful abysses of the night; to run from gray heap to gray heap,
        igniting the long line of signal fires, until the whole earth
        seems a conflagration and the heavens are as rosy as at morn; to
        look far away and descry on the horizon an array of answering
        light; not in one direction only, but leagues away, to see the
        fainter ever fainter glow of burning hempherds --- this, too, is
        one of the experiences, one of the memories.And now along the
        turnpikes the great loaded creaking wagons pass slowly to the
        towns, bearing the hemp to the factories, thence to be scattered
        over the land and sea. Some day, when the winds of March are
        dying down, the sower enters the field and begins where he began
        twelve months before. </p>
      <p>A round year of the earth's changes enters into the creation of
        hemp. The planet has described its vast orbit ere it be grown
        and finished. All the seasons are its servitors; all
        contradictions and extremes of nature meet in its making. The
        vernal patience of the warming soil; the long, fierce arrows of
        summer rain; autumn's dead skies and sobbing winds; winter's
        sternest, all-tightening frosts. Of none but strong virtues is
        it the sum. Sickness or infirmity it knows not. It will have a
        mother young and vigorous, or none; an old or weak or exhausted
        soil cannot produce it. It will endure no roof or shade, basking
        only in the eye of the fatherly sun, and demanding the whole sky
        for the walls of its nursery. </p>
      <p>Ah! Type, too, of our life, also is earth-sown, earth-rooted;
        which must struggle upward, be cut down, rotted and broken, ere
        the separation take place between our dross and our worth ---
        poor perishable shard and immortal fibre. Oh, the mystery, the
        mystery of that growth from the casting of the soul as a seed
        into the dark earth, until the time when, led through all
        natural changes and cleansed of weakness, it is borne from the
        fields of its nativity for the long service...</p>
