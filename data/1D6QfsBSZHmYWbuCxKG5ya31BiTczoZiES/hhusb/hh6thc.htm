      <b>6.1 ~&nbsp;<a name="HH61"></a>The Cannabinoids</b>
      <p>Cannabis' notorious resin is a complex mixture of cannabinoids,
        terpenes, and waxes, etc. There are about 100 known cannabinoids
        that occur only in hemp, with the exception of Cannabichromene,
        which is found in a few other plants. The entire hemp plant
        contains several hundred known chemicals.<b>(1-3)</b> </p>
      <p>The cannabinoids are thought to be formed by condensation of
        monoterpene derivatives such as geraniol phosphate with a
        depside-type olivetolic acid. This leads initially to the
        formation of Cannabigerol (CBG) and Cannabichromene (CBC) and
        their carboxylic acids, then to Cannabidiolic Acid (CBDA), which
        undergoes ring closure to form TetraHydroCannabinol (THC) and
        its acid (THCA). The latter decarboxylates to form THC. Other
        biogenetic pathways featuring CBC have been proposed by De
        Faubert Maunder and by Turner and Hadley. <b>(4, 5) (Fig. 6.1)</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Figure 6.1 ~ Cannabinoids</b> </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="61fighmp.gif" height="1335" width="811"></p>
      </center>
      <p>The acids comprise up to 40% of the cannabinoid content of
        young plants. THC dehydrogenates to form Cannabidiol (CBD). THC
        is a primary psychoactive cannabinoid. The minor constituent
        Cannabiverol (CBV) possesses only about 20% of THC’s activity.
        CBD and CBN are not psychoactive, but they have valuable medical
        properties. <b>(6-10)</b> </p>
      <p>Many synthetic analogs of THC are more or less potent than the
        parent molecule. The dimethylheptyl derivative is over 50 times
        more active, with effects lasting several days. Some nitrogen
        and sulfur analogs also are psychoactive. </p>
      <p>The total synthesis of THC has been accomplished in many ways,
        most of which are difficult. However, the extraction of
        cannabinoids, their purification, isomerization and acetylation
        are easy experiments for dilettante <i>souffleurs</i> who would
        possess this elixir. </p>
      <center>
        <hr width="62%"></center>
      <p><b>6.2 Extraction ~</b><a name="HH62"></a> </p>
      <p>Cannabis must be dried be it is extracted, because it is not
        possible to remove more than 50% of the cannabinoids from fresh
        material THC-Acid is difficult to extract If you plant to
        convert the THCA to THC, the plant material should be thoroughly
        decarboxylated by heating it under nitrogen at 105° C for 1 hour
        before performing a solvent extraction. </p>
      <p>Chloroform is the most efficient solvent for the extraction of
        THC from cannabis. A single extraction will remove 98-99% of the
        cannabinoids within 30 minutes. A second extraction removes only
        88-99% of the cannabinoids within 30 minutes. A second
        extraction removes 100% of the THC. Light petroleum ether
        (60-80°) also works well, but a single extraction removes only
        88-95% of the cannabinoids; a double extraction removes up to
        99%. Ethanol also can be used, but it removes ballast pigments
        and sugars which complicate the purification of the resin <b>(11,



          12)</b> </p>
      <p>Extract the dried cannabis with a suitable solvent for several
        hours at room temperature or by refluxing. Filter through
        charcoal to clarify the solution, then chill overnight to
        precipitate waxes, then filter the solution again. Concentrate
        it to one-half volume, and extract it with 2% aqueous sodium
        sulfate (to prevent oxidation). Separate the aqueous layer, and
        strip the solvent. The residue is crude hemp oil. </p>
      <p>The odoriferous terpenes can be removed by steam or vacuum
        distillation. Cautious distillation in vacuo yields a fraction
        of crude red oil (bp 100-220° C/3 mm). This can be purified by
        redistillation or column chromatography. Use ethanol to remove
        the residue from the flask while it is still hot. Filter the
        solution through charcoal, and strip the solvent. Distill the
        residue to yield pure red oil (bp 175-195° C /2 mm).
        Distillation must be stopped if smoke appears, indicating
        decomposition. <b>(13, 14)</b> </p>
      <p>Because THC is heat-sensitive, it is preferable to isolate the
        cannabinoids by column chromatography. The simplest method of
        column chromatography is performed with ethanol and ether
        extracts of hemp on alumina, yielding two major fractions: (1)
        chlorophyll, CBD, and CBN, and (2) THC. A second, more difficult
        method is performed on Florisil (use 10 times the weight of the
        oil) with the solvent system hexane:2% methanol. This yields a
        doubly-concentrated, viscous oil which can be repeatedly
        chromatographed on alumina to separate the THC and CBD. <b>(15)</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>6.3 Isomerization ~</b><a name="HH63"></a> </p>
      <p>The potency of marijuana can be increased by about 50% simply
        by simmering a water slurry of the material for 2 hours. Add
        water as necessary to maintain the level. Cool and filter the
        mixture, and refrigerate the aqueous solution. Dry the leaf
        material at low heat. Drink the tea before smoking the
        marijuana. The effects are much more intense and last longer
        than those from the untreated leaves. The boiling water
        treatment isomerizes the inactive CBD, and decarboxylates THCA
        to THC. </p>
      <p>Although Cannabidiol (CBD) has no psychoactivity, it does
        antagonize THC and produces other valuable sedative, antibiotic,
        and anti-epileptic effects. CBD can be isomerized to THC. If the
        plant is Phenotype III (containing mainly CBD in its resin),
        isomerization can double the yield of THC. </p>
      <p>The CBD fraction of column chromatography can be distilled (bp
        187-190° C/2 mm; pale yellow resin) to purify it. Isomerization
        can be accomplished with any of several solvents and acids.
        Alcohol and sulfuric acid isomerizes only 50-60% of CBD to THC;
        p-TolueneSulfonic Acid (p-TSA) in petroleum ether or other
        light, non-polar solvent will convert 90% of CBD to THC upon
        refluxing 1 hour at 130° F. <b>(16, 17)</b> </p>
      <p>Reflux 3 gr CBD in 100 ml dry benzene for 2 hours with 200 mg
        p-TSA monohydrate until the alkaline Beam test (5% KOH in
        ethanol) is negative (no color). The Beam test gives a deep
        violet color with CBD. Separate the upper layer, wash it with 5%
        sodium bicarbonate, wash again with water, and strip the
        solvent. The remaining viscous oil should give a negative
        reaction to the Beam test. The crude THC can be purified by
        distillation (bp 169-172° C/0.03 mm), or by chromatography in 25
        ml pentane on 300 gr alumina. Elute with pentane 95:5 ether to
        yield fraction of CBD and THC. Combine the THC fractions and
        distill (bp 175-178° C/1 mm). </p>
      <p>Reflux 2 gr CBD in 35 ml cyclohexane, and slowly add a few
        drops of sulfuric acid. Continue to reflux until the Beam test
        is negative. Separate the sulfuric acid from the reaction
        mixture. Wash the solution twice with aqueous sodium
        bicarbonate, the twice again with water. Purify by
        chromatography, or distill (bp 165° C/0.01 mm). Any unreacted
        CBD can be recycled. </p>
      <p>Another method is to reflux a mixture of 6 gr dry pyridine
        hydrochloride and 3 gr CBD at 125° C until the Beam test is
        negative. Wash the reaction mixture with water to remove the
        pyridine, then extract the mixture with ether. Wash the ether
        with water, evaporate the ether, and distill the residue i.v. to
        yield pure THC. </p>
      <p>Similarly, reflux 3 gr CBD in 150 ml ethanol with 50 ml 85%
        phosphoric acid until the Beam test is negative. Work up the
        reaction mixture, and purify the THC. </p>
      <p>Alternatively, reflux 3 gr CBD in 100 ml absolute ethanol
        containing 0.05% HCl for 19 hours. Extract the ether, wash the
        ether with water, dry, evaporate, and chromatograph on 400 gr
        alumina to yield: </p>
      <p>(a) 0.5 gr 1-EthoxyHexaHydro-CBN (EHH-CBN: mp 86-87° C); elute
        with pentane 98:2 ether. Recrystalize from methanol and water. </p>
      <p>(b) 2 gr THC; elute with pentane 95:5 ether. Repeated
        chromatography will separate the less polar forms. </p>
      <p>(c) 0.5 gr EHH-CBN, eluted with pentane 93:7 ether. It can be
        isomerized to THC by refluxing in benzene for 2 hours. Cool the
        reaction mixture, wash it with water; separate, dry, and strip
        the solvent layer i.v. to yield THC. </p>
      <p>CBD also can be isomerized by irradiation of a cyclohexane
        solution in a quartz vessel with a mercury lamp (235-265 nm) for
        20 minutes. Workup of the reaction mixture yields 7-13% THC. <b>(18-20)</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>6.4 ~ Acetylation</b><a name="HH64"></a> </p>
      <p>THC gives an acetate (ATHC) which is as potent as THC. The
        mental effects are quite subtle and pleasant. Wohlner, et al.,
        prepared ATHC by refluxing the crude distillate of cannabis oil
        with approximately 3 volumes of acetic anhydride. It is purified
        by distillation i.v. or with steam. </p>
      <p>Cahn prepared ATHC thus: add 150 ml acetyl chloride (dropwise
        with stirring and cooling) to 185 gr crude resin in 500 ml dry
        pyridine. Crystals may separate during the addition, or on
        standing a few hours at room temperature. Pour the mixture into
        dilute hydrochloric acid/ice. Separate the oil, then dissolve it
        in ether. Wash this solution with dilute acid, then with aqueous
        sodium carbonate, and again with water. Dry the solution with
        calcium chloride. Strip the solvent and distill the residue
        (240-270 C°/20 mm). The mixture of acetylated cannabinoids is
        separated by dissolving 2 gr in 100 ml benzene and
        chromatography over silica (150-200 mesh). Elute with 800 ml
        benzene. Combine the washings and the original effluent
        solutions, then strip the benzene i.v. to recover about 60%
        yield of light yellow oil. The material remaining on the column
        contains CBD and other cannabinoid acetates which can be
        recovered with ethanol and worked up.<b>(21)</b> </p>
      <hr width="62%">
      <p><b>6.5 ~&nbsp;<a name="HH65"></a>Identification</b> </p>
      <p>Colorimetric tests are the simplest method of identifying
        cannabinoids. Hundreds more sophisticated analytical methods
        have been developed, as a review of <i>Chemical Abstracts</i>
        will reveal. </p>
      <p>The Beam test is relatively specific. It gives a purple color
        with 5% ethanolic KOH, based on the oxidation of CBD, CBG, etc.,
        and their acids to hydroxyquinones. However, THC does not react
        to the Beam test. Only two plants (Rosemary and Salvia) out of
        129 common species tested give a weakly positive reaction. Among
        some 50 pure vegetable substances such as mono- and
        sesqui-terpenes, aromatics, etc., only juglone, embelin, and
        alkyl dioxyquinone develop a color reaction close to that of
        Cannabis. The reaction is not always dependable; it can be
        absent if the ethanol is hot. <b>(22, 23)</b> </p>
      <p>A modification of the Beam test uses absolute ethanol saturated
        with gaseous hydrogen chloride. When added to an extract of
        suspect material, it gives a cherry red color which disappears
        if water is added. However, the test also gives more or less
        similar red color reactions with pinene, tobacco, julep, sage,
        rosemary, and lavender, etc.. </p>
      <p>The colorimetric test of Duquenois and Moustapha is not so
        specific as the Beam test, but it is very sensitive. The test
        reacts to CBN and CBD, but not to THC: </p>
      <p>Vanillin (0.4 gr, acetaldehyde (0.06 gr) and 20 ml 95% ethanol
        is stored in a bottle. Extract the plant material with petroleum
        ether, then filter it and evaporate the solvent. Add exactly 2
        ml of reagent and 2 ml concentrated hydrochloric acid. Stir the
        mixture; it turns sea-green, then slate gray, followed by indigo
        within 10 minutes. It turns violet within 30 minutes and becomes
        more intense. </p>
      <p>The Duquenois-Negm hydrogen peroxide/sulfuric acid test is
        suitable for following the development of the resin and its
        potency. Macerate cannabis in chloroform or light petroleum
        ether for several hours. Evaporate 0.2 ml of the extract in a
        porcelain dish. Add 2 drops 30% hydrogen peroxide and 0.5 ml
        concentrated sulfuric acid. Rotate the dish gently, and observe
        the color of the liquid after 5 minutes. A pink color indicates
        CBD; blood-red color indicates a high concentration of THC.
        Violet or strong brown indicates THC. CBN produces a green color
        which quickly turns green-brown. <b>(24)</b> </p>
      <p>The identification of cannabinoids has been made irrefutable by
        the modern development of gas chromatography, especially when
        combined with mass spectrometry. </p>
      <p>Laboratories which do not possess these technologies can use
        diode-array and programmable variable-wavelength ultraviolet
        absorption detectors in conjunction with thin-layer
        chromatography (TLC) or high-performance liquid chromatography
        (HPLC), or a combination of both, and make comparisons with
        published data in conjunction with the specific absorption
        spectrum for the cannabinoids (200-300 nm). The combination of
        these techniques can overcome the problem of errors due to
        interference which often occur when single methods are used. <b>(25)</b>

      <p><b>6.6 ~&nbsp;<a name="HH66"></a>Neurology</b> </p>
      <p>In 1984, Miles Herkenham and his colleagues at NIMH mapped the
        brain receptors for THC, using radioactive analogs of THC
        developed by Pfizer Central Research. They found the most
        receptors in the hippocampus, where memory consolidation occurs.
        There we translate the external world into a cognitive and
        spatial "map". Receptors also exist in the cortex, where higher
        cognition is performed. Very few receptors are found in the
        limbic brainstem, where the automatic life-support systems are
        controlled. This may explain why it is so difficult to die from
        an overdose of cannabis. The presence of THC receptors in the
        nasal ganglia --- an area of the brain involved in the
        coordination of movement --- may enable the cannabinoids to
        relieve spasticity. Some receptors are located in the spinal
        cord, and may be the site of the analgesic activity of cannabis.
        A few receptors are found in the testes. These may account for
        the effects of THC on spermatogenesis and as an aphrodisiac. </p>
      <p>S. Munro, <i>et al</i>., located a peripheral CX5 receptor for
        cannabinoids in the marginal zone of the spleen. The
        Anandamide/cannabinoid receptor site, a protein on the cell
        surface, activates G-proteins inside the cell and leads to a
        cascade of other biochemical reactions which generate euphoria.
        <b>(26-31)</b> </p>
      <p>The brain produces Anandamide (Arachidonylethanolamide), which
        is the endogenous ligand of the cannabinoid receptor. It was
        first identified by William Devane and Raphael Mechoulam, <i>et
          al</i>., in 1992. Anandamide has biological and behavioral
        effects similar to THC. Devane named the substance after the
        Sanskrit word <i>Ananda</i> (Bliss). The discovery of
        Anandamide and its receptor site has unlocked the door to the
        world of cannabinoid pharmacology. <b>(32-35)</b> </p>
      <p>CBD antagonizes THC and competes with THC to fill the
        cannabinoid receptor site. THC also exerts an inhibitory effect
        on acetylcholine activity through a GABA-ergic mechanism. It
        significantly increases the intersynaptic levels of serotonin by
        blocking its reuptake into the presynaptic neuron. THC also
        elevates the brain level of 5-hydroxy-tryptamine (5-HT) while
        antagonizing the peripheral actions of 5-HT. <b>(36-39)</b> </p>
      <p>In 1990, Patricia Reggio, <i>et al</i>., developed a molecular
        reactivity template for the design of cannabinoid analgesics
        with minimal psychoactivity. The analgesic activity of the
        template molecule (9-nor-9b-OH-HHC) is attributed to the
        presence and positions of two regions of negative potential on
        top of the molecule. The template places all cannabinoid
        analgesics on a common map, no matter how dissimilar their
        structures. <b>(40)</b> </p>

OF







          THE INVENTION </span><br>
        <br>
        [0002] The present invention relates generally to the field of
        chemical synthesis. More specifically, the present invention
        relates methods of converting CBD to .DELTA..sup.8-THC or
        .DELTA..sup.9-THC. <br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </span><br>
        <br>
        [0003] Recently, public interest in Cannabis as medicine has
        been growing, based in no small part on the fact that Cannabis
        has long been considered to have medicinal properties, ranging
        from treatment of cramps, migraines, convulsions, appetite
        stimulation and attenuation of nausea and vomiting. In fact, a
        report issued by the National Academy of Sciences' Institute of
        Medicine indicated that the active components of Cannabis appear
        to be useful in treating pain, nausea, AIDS-related weight loss
        or "wasting", muscle spasms in multiple sclerosis as well as
        other problems. Advocates of medical marijuana argue that it is
        also useful for glaucoma, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's
        disease, migraines, epilepsy and Alzheimer's disease. <br>
        <br>
        [0004] Marijuana refers to varieties of Cannabis having a high
        content of .DELTA..sup.9-tetrahydrocannabinol
        (.DELTA..sup.9-THC), which is the psychoactive ingredient of
        marijuana whereas industrial hemp refers to varieties of the
        Cannabis plant that have a low content of .DELTA..sup.9-THC. <br>
        <br>
        [0005] Furthermore, .DELTA..sup.9-THC is only one of a family of
        about 60 bi- and tri-cyclic compounds named cannabinoids. For
        example, .DELTA..sup.8-THC is a double bond isomer of
        .DELTA..sup.9-THC and is a minor constituent of most varieties
        of Cannabis (Hollister and Gillespie, 1972, Clin Pharmacol Ther
        14: 353). The major chemical difference between the two
        compounds is that .DELTA..sup.9-THC is easily oxidized to
        cannabinol whereas .DELTA..sup.8-THC does not and is in fact
        very stable. .DELTA..sup.8-THC, for the most part, produces
        similar psychometric effects as does .DELTA..sup.9-THC, but is
        generally considered to be 50% less potent than
        .DELTA..sup.9-THC and has been shown in some cases to be 3-10
        times less potent. .DELTA..sup.8-THC has also been shown to be
        more (200%) effective an anti-emetic than .DELTA..sup.9-THC and
        has been used as an anti-emetic in children, based on the belief
        that the side effects of .DELTA..sup.9-THC and
        .DELTA..sup.8-THC, such as anxiety and dysphoria, are more
        prevalent in adults than children (Abrahamov et al, 1995, Life
        Sciences 56: 2097-2102). On the other hand, CBD has no activity
        on its own when administered to humans. It is of note that CBD
        is typically about 2% (0.5-4%) dry weight of hemp chaff,
        .DELTA..sup.8-THC is approximately 0.2% (0.05-0.5%) dry weight
        and .DELTA..sup.9-THC is approximately 0.1% (0.05-0.3%). <br>
        <br>
        [0006] Gaoni and Mechoulam (1966, Tetrahedron 22: 1481-1488)
        teach methods of converting CBD to, among other compounds,
        .DELTA..sup.8-THC and .DELTA..sup.9-THC comprising boiling a
        solution of CBD (3.0 g) in absolute ethanol (100 ml) containing
        0.05% HCl for 18 hours. The solution was then poured into water
        and extracted with ether. The ether solution was washed with
        water, dried (Na.sub.2SO.sub.4) and evaporated.
        .DELTA..sup.8-THC and .DELTA..sup.9-THC were eluted from the
        resulting oil and separated by chromatography. In another
        experiment, CBD (3.14 g) was dissolved in benzene (100 ml)
        containing 2 mg/ml p-toluenesulphonic acid and boiled for two
        hours. The reaction mixture was poured into water and the upper
        layer was separated, washed with 5% NaHCO.sub.3, then with
        water, dried and evaporated. Elution with pentane-ether (95:5)
        gave an oily material which was subsequently distilled.
        Percentage yield of .DELTA..sup.8-THC (.DELTA..sup.1(6)-THC) was
        given as 64% of the crude material in this paper. The crude oil
        product, which showed only one spot by thin layer
        chromatography, was purified by vacuum distillation. <br>
        <br>
        [0007] Gaoni and Mechoulam (1964, J Amer Chem Soc 86: 1646) also
        described a method for converting CBD to .DELTA..sup.9-THC
        comprising boiling a mixture of CBD in ethanol containing 0.05%
        hydrogen chloride for 2 hours. Percentage yield of
        .DELTA..sup.9-THC (.DELTA..sup.1-THC) was 2% (Mechoulam et al,
        1972, J Amer Chem Soc 94: 6159-6165; Mechoulam and Gaoni, 1965,
        J Amer Chem Soc 87: 3273). Using boron trifluoride, the yield
        was 70% (Gaoni and Mechoulam, 1971, J Amer Chem Soc 93: 217-224)
        although purity was not given. <br>
        <br>
        [0008] Clearly, as the cannabinoids are of potential medicinal
        value, improved methods of converting CBD to .DELTA..sup.9-THC
        or .DELTA..sup.8-THC are needed. <br>
        <br>

        <span style="font-weight: bold;">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED
          EMBODIMENTS</span> <br>
        <br>
        [0043] Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific
        terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood
        by one of ordinary skill in the art to which the invention
        belongs. Although any methods and materials similar or
        equivalent to those described herein can be used in the practice
        or testing of the present invention, the preferred methods and
        materials are now described. All publications mentioned
        hereunder are incorporated herein by reference. <br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">DEFINITIONS </span><br>
        <br>
        [0044] As used herein, CBD refers to cannabidiol. <br>
        <br>
        [0045] As used herein, .DELTA..sup.9-THC refers to
        .DELTA..sup.9-tetrahydrocannabinol. <br>
        <br>
        [0046] As used herein, .DELTA..sup.8-THC refers to
        .DELTA..sup.8-tetrahydrocannabinol. <br>
        <br>
        [0047] As used herein, "Lewis acid" refers to a powerful
        electron pair acceptor. Examples include but are by no means
        limited to BF.sub.3Et.sub.2O, p-toluenesulfonic acid and boron
        trifluoride. <br>
        <br>
        [0048] Described herein are methods and protocols for converting
        cannabidiol (CBD) to .DELTA..sup.8-tetrahydrocannabinol
        (.DELTA..sup.8-THC) or .DELTA..sup.9-tetrahydrocannabinol
        (.DELTA..sup.9-THC). As will be appreciated by one knowledgeable
        in the art and as discussed below, the reaction times may be
        varied somewhat, producing product at different yields and
        purities. Furthermore, functional equivalents may be substituted
        where appropriate. <br>
        <br>
        [0049] Specifically, described herein is a method of converting
        CBD to a tetrahydrocannabinol comprising: providing a reaction
        mixture comprising a catalyst in an organic solvent, adding CBD
        to the reaction mixture, mixing said reaction mixture, allowing
        the mixture to separate into an aqueous phase and an organic
        phase; removing the organic phase, and eluting the
        tetrahydrocannabinol from the organic phase. The
        tetrahydrocannabinol may then be combined with suitable
        excipients known in the art, thereby forming a pharmaceutical
        composition. <br>
        <br>
        [0050] In some embodiments, the tetrahydrocannabinol at
        therapeutically effective concentrations or dosages be combined
        with a pharmaceutically or pharmacologically acceptable carrier,
        excipient or diluent, either biodegradable or non-biodegradable.
        Exemplary examples of carriers include, but are by no means
        limited to, for example, poly(ethylene-vinyl acetate),
        copolymers of lactic acid and glycolic acid, poly(lactic acid),
        gelatin, collagen matrices, polysaccharides, poly(D,L lactide),
        poly(malic acid), poly(caprolactone), celluloses, albumin,
        starch, casein, dextran, polyesters, ethanol, mathacrylate,
        polyurethane, polyethylene, vinyl polymers, glycols, mixtures
        thereof and the like. Standard excipients include gelatin,
        casein, lecithin, gum acacia, cholesterol, tragacanth, stearic
        acid, benzalkonium chloride, calcium stearate, glyceryl
        monostearate, cetostearyl alcohol, cetomacrogol emulsifying wax,
        sorbitan esters, polyoxyethylene alkyl ethers, polyoxyethylene
        castor oil derivatives, polyoxyethylene sorbitan fatty acid
        esters, polyethylene glycols, polyoxyethylene stearates,
        colloidol silicon dioxide, phosphates, sodium dodecylsulfate,
        carboxymethylcellulose calcium, carboxymethylcellulose sodium,
        methylcellulose, hydroxyethylcellulose, hydroxypropylcellulose,
        hydroxypropylmethylcellulose phthalate, noncrystalline
        cellulose, magnesium aluminum silicate, triethanolamine,
        polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinylpyrrolidone, sugars and starches.
        See, for example, Remington: The Science and Practice of
        Pharmacy, 1995, Gennaro ed. <br>
        <br>
        [0051] In some embodiments, the catalyst is a Lewis acid, for
        example, p-toluenesulfonic acid, boron trifluoride or
        BF.sub.3Et.sub.2O. In some embodiments, the BF.sub.3Et.sub.2O is
        in dry methylene chloride, ethyl acetate, ethanol, hexane or
        other organic solvent. In yet other examples, the catalyst may
        be hydrochloric acid in ethanol or sulfuric acid in cyclohexane.
        <br>
        <br>
        [0052] In some embodiments, a weak base is added to the reaction
        mixture prior to allowing the reaction mixture to separate into
        organic and aqueous phases. The base may be an alkali metal
        hydrogen carbonate or a carbonate of an alkali metal. <br>
        <br>
        [0053] In some embodiments, the organic layer is dried prior to
        eluting. In these embodiments, a suitable drying or dehydration
        compound, for example, MgSO.sub.4 or Na.sub.2SO.sub.4 is used. <br>
        <br>
        [0054] In yet other embodiments, the process may be carried out
        under a nitrogen atmosphere. <br>
        <br>
        [0055] As discussed below, yield is determined by looking at the
        peak area for the isolated compound in the gas
        chromatography--mass spectra analysis of the crude reaction
        product mixture. It is important to note that in the prior art,
        yield is often calculated on the basis of the basis of first
        isolated crude product before final purification. In some
        embodiments of the process, as discussed below, yield is at
        least 50%. In other embodiments, the yield is at least 60%. In
        other embodiments, yield is at least 70%. In yet other
        embodiments, yield is 70-85%. <br>
        <br>
        [0056] Purity is also determined by GC-MS and also by analytical
        HPLC. The total ion chromatogram from the GC-MS gives
        information similar to that provided by an FID-GC in that the
        peak area is proportional to the mass of the analytes detected.
        Total peak area and the peak areas of the individual analytes
        can be compared in the GC-MS case as long as the masses are in
        generally the same range. As discussed below, in some
        embodiments, purity of the tetrahydrocannabinols isolated by the
        process is greater than 90%. In yet other embodiments, purity is
        greater than 95%. In yet other embodiments, purity is greater
        than 97%. In yet other embodiments, purity is 98-99%. <br>
        <br>
        [0057] The invention will now be described by means of examples,
        although the invention is not limited to these examples. <br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">EXAMPLE I </span><br>
        <br>
        Conversion of CBD TO .DELTA..sup.8-THC <br>
        <br>
        [0058] CBD (300 mg) was added to dried p-toluenesulfonic acid
        (30 mg) in toluene (15 ml), under N.sub.2 atmosphere. In this
        example, the mixture was refluxed (under N.sub.2) for 1 hour,
        although other time periods may also be used, as discussed
        below. It was then diluted with ether (20 ml) and poured into
        cold water, The upper layer was separated, washed with aqueous
        5% NaHCO.sub.3, then with water, dried over MgSO.sub.4 and
        evaporated. The viscous oil showed mainly one spot on TLC (using
        20% ether in petroleum ether as eluent). HPLC, on the crude oil,
        showed the presence of 86% .DELTA..sup.8-THC. The oil was
        chromatographed on a silica gel column (6 g). Elution with 5 to
        10% ether in petroleum ether gave a fraction (244 mg, 81%) of
        .DELTA..sup.8-THC 98.6% pure. When the reaction was carried out
        using various reflux times showed the presence of 79.33%
        .DELTA..sup.8-THC (15 minutes), 81.7% .DELTA..sup.8-THC (30
        minutes) and 84.6% .DELTA..sup.8-THC (2 hours). <br>
        <br>
        [0059] In the example described above, normal phase HPLC
        separation is used wherein the column is for example a silica
        gel and the mobile phase is organic, for example, hexane or
        ethyl ether-hexane. In other embodiments, reverse phase HPLC
        separation is used, wherein the column is for example C18 bonded
        silica gel and the mobile phase is water-methanol or
        water-acetonitrile. In each case, solvent programming is used. <br>
        <br>
        [0060] The p-toluenesulfonic acid is used as a catalyst in the
        above example. It is of note that boron trifluoride could also
        be used as a catalyst, as could a number of other Lewis acids
        known in the art. It is of note that the exact proportion is not
        essential to the reaction proceeding. It is of further note that
        the nitrogen atmosphere does not appear as necessary as during
        the conversion of CBD to .DELTA..sup.9-THC. It is also of note
        that other solvents may also be used, for example, benzene, but
        toluene has produced the best results so far. <br>
        <br>
        [0061] In other embodiments, anhydrous Na.sub.2SO.sub.4 or
        another suitable drying or dehydration agent known in the art is
        used in place of the MgSO.sub.4. <br>
        <br>
        [0062] In other embodiments, an alkali metal hydrogen carbonate
        or carbonate of an alkali metal is used instead of NaHCO.sub.3.
        <br>
        <br>
        [0063] The nitrogen atmosphere may prevent oxidation of the
        reaction intermediate, thereby enhancing the yield. Diluting
        into ether first and then adding the water again prevents undue
        exposure to oxidizing conditions. The water still quenches the
        reaction catalyst, but the reaction product is dissolved in the
        toluene and ether and is to some extent protected. That is, it
        is not in as intimate contact with the water and not as
        susceptible to oxidation as it would be if the water were to be
        added first. <br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">EXAMPLE II </span><br>
        <br>
        Conversion of CBD to .DELTA..sup.9-THC <br>
        <br>
        [0064] BF.sub.3Et.sub.2O (50 .mu.l) was added, under nitrogen
        atmosphere, to ice cold solution of CBD (300 mg) in dry
        methylene chloride (15 ml). The solution was stirred at
        0.degree. C. for 1 hour. Saturated aqueous solution of
        NaHCO.sub.3 (2 ml) was added until the red color faded. The
        organic layer was removed, washed with water, dried over
        MgSO.sub.4 and evaporated. The composition of the oil obtained
        (determined by HPLC): trans-.DELTA..sup.8-isoTHC 27%,
        .DELTA..sup.9-THC 66.7%. The oil was chromatographed on silica
        gel column (20 g) and eluted with petroleum ether followed by
        graded mixtures, up to 2:98 of ether in petroleum ether. The
        first fraction eluted was the .DELTA..sup.8-iso THC (30 mg,
        9.5%) followed by a mixture of .DELTA..sup.8-iso THC and
        .DELTA..sup.9-THC (100 mg). The last compound to be eluted was
        the .DELTA..sup.9-THC (172 mg, 57%). The purity of
        .DELTA..sup.9-THC (as determined by HPLC) was 98.7%. <br>
        <br>
        [0065] It is of note that when the reaction was carried in the
        presence of MgSO.sub.4 (120 mg), the composition of the oil
        obtained (determined by FIPLC) was: trans-.DELTA..sup.8-isoTHC
        20.15%, .DELTA..sup.9-THC 56.7%. <br>
        <br>
        [0066] In the example described above, normal phase HPLC
        separation is used wherein the column is for example a silica
        gel and the mobile phase is organic, for example, hexane or
        ethyl ether-hexane. In other embodiments, reverse phase HPLC
        separation is used, wherein the column is for example C18 bonded
        silica gel and the mobile phase is water-methanol or
        water-acetonitrile. In each case, solvent programming is used. <br>
        <br>
        [0067] In other embodiments, anhydrous Na.sub.2SO.sub.4 or
        another suitable drying or dehydration agent known in the art is
        used in place of the MgSO.sub.4. <br>
        <br>
        [0068] In other embodiments, another alkali metal hydrogen
        carbonate or carbonate of an alkali metal is used instead of
        NaHCO.sub.3. <br>
        <br>
        [0069] In other embodiments, BF.sub.3Et.sub.2O is dissolved in
        ethyl acetate, ethanol, hexane or other suitable organic
        solvent. <br>
        <br>
        [0070] In other embodiments, the catalyst is hydrochloric acid
        in ethanol or sulfuric acid in cyclohexane (reaction mixture
        refluxed rather than stirred). <br>
        <br>
        [0071] While the preferred embodiments of the invention have
        been described above, it will be recognized and understood that
        various modifications may be made therein, and the appended
        claims are intended to cover all such modifications which may
        fall within the spirit and scope of the invention. <br>
