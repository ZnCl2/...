      <span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">The
        application of electricity, magnetism, monochrome light, and
        sound can stimulate the growth of plants to a great extent. This
        little-known technology, called Electro-culture, can accelerate
        growth rates, increase yields, and improve crop quality.
        Electro-culture can protect plants from diseases, insects and
        frost. These methods also can reduce the requirements for
        fertilizer or pesticides. Farmers can grow bigger and better
        crops in less time, with less effort, and at a lower cost. </span><br
        style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">
      <span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><br>
        The several approaches to Electro-culture include: antennas,
        static electricity, direct and alternating current, magnetism,
        radio frequencies, monochrome and intermittent lighting, and
        sound. The energies are applied to the seeds, plants, soil or
        the&nbsp; water and nutrients. </span><br style="font-family:

        The French farmer Justin Christofloreau attracted attention in
        1925 with his apparatus to collect atmospheric energy for his
        crops. Clover treated by his method grew 7 feet high.
        Christofloreau's apparatus consisted of a 25-ft wooden pole; at
        the top was a metal pointer aligned north-south, and an antenna.
        Copper and zinc strips were soldered together to generate
        electricity from solar heat. Several of&nbsp; the poles were set
        about 10 ft apart, and the wires leading from them extended
        about 1000 yards. Christofloreau claimed that the accumulated
        electricity destroyed parasites and promoted beneficial chemical
        processes in the soil.</span><b style="font-family: Times New

      <span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><br>
        In 1924, Georges Lakhovsky devised his Oscillator Circuit, a
        one-turn copper coil with overlapping ends separated by a gap.
        Capacitance generates oscillating currents that benefit the
        plants. The ring is supported by an insulator such as a plastic
        rod. This extremely simple arrangement stimulates plant growth (</span><b
        style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">Fig. 5.1</b><span
        style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">). </span><b

        style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">
      <span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><br>
        Other configurations also enhance plant growth. A conical coil
        of stiff wire wound with 9 turns (counter-clockwise in the
        Northern Hemisphere, clockwise in the Southern), when stuck in
        the ground about 1 ft north of a plant, will collect atmospheric
        electricity. Connect a wire from the fence to a metal rod near
        the plants. A tv antenna also can be used. Rebar can be sunk
        into the ground at each end of a row of plants, connected by a
        bare wire under the soil and/or in the air. A north-south
        orientation will take advantage of geomagnetic polarity. </span>

        Experimental study of the effects of electricity on plant growth
        began in 1746, when Dr. Maimbray of Edinburg treated myrtle
        plants with the output of an electrostatic generator, thereby
        enhancing their growth and flowering. Two years later, the
        French abbot Jean Nolet found that plants respond with
        accelerated rates of germination and overall growth when
        cultivated under charged electrodes. </span><br
        style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">
      <span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><br>
        Beginning in 1885, the Finnish scientist Selim Laemstrom
        experimented with an aerial system powered by a Wimhurst
        generator and Leyden jars. He found that the electrical
        discharge from wire points stimulated the growth of crops such
        as potatoes, carrots, and celery for an average increase of
        about 40% (up to 70%) within 8 weeks. Greenhouse-grown
        strawberry plants produced ripe fruit in half the usual time.
        The yield of raspberries was increased by 95%, and the yield of
        carrots was increased by 125%. Crops of cabbage, turnips, and
        flax, however, grew better </span><u style="font-family: Times
        New Roman,Times,serif;">without</u><span style="font-family:
        Times New Roman,Times,serif;"> electrification than with it. The
        Laemstrom system comprises a horizontal antenna suspended high
        enough to permit plowing, weeding and irrigation. The voltage
        applied to the antenna varies from 2 to 70 KV, depending on the
        height of the antenna. The current is about 11 amps. </span><b

        style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"> </span><br
        style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">
      <span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><br>
        Spechniew and Bertholon obtained similar results a few years
        later, and so did the Swiss priest J.J. Gasner in 1909. Also
        that year, Prof. G. Stone showed that a few sparks of static
        electricity discharged into the soil each day increased soil
        bacteria up to 600%. </span><br style="font-family: Times New
        Roman,Times,serif;">
      <span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><br>
        In the 1920s, V.H. Blackman reported his experiments with an
        aerial system similar to that of&nbsp; Laemstrom. He applied 60
        volts DC/1 milliamp through 3 steel wires each 32 ft long and
        suspended 6 ft apart and 7 ft high on poles. This arrangement
        yielded an average increase of about 50% for several plant
        types. </span><b style="font-family: Times New

      <span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><br>
        In 1898, Grandeau and Leclerq studied the effect of atmospheric
        electricity on plants by covering part of a field with a wire
        net which shielded them from natural electrical action. The
        uncovered plants grew 50-60% better than the shielded plants. </span><br
        style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">
      <span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><br>
        Wet soil improves current flow. Electro-cultured plants require
        about 10% more water than control plants because the charged
        water is perspired more rapidly than under normal conditions.
        Positive results are always obtained except when ozone is formed
        by ionization. Negative aero-ions intensify cellular oxidation
        reduction processes, while the positives depress them. </span>

        In the 1840s, W. Ross of New York reportedly obtained a
        severalfold increase in the yield of a field of potatoes when he
        buried a copper plate (5 ft x 14 ft) in the earth, and a zinc
        plate of the same dimensions 200 ft away. The two plates were
        connected by a wire above ground, thus forming a galvanic cell.
        In similar experiments by Holdenfleiss (1844) with
        battery-charged zinc and copper plates, yields increased up to
        25%.</span><b style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">(7)</b><span

        From 1918 to 1921 some 500 British farmers developed a shared
        system to treat their grain in an electrified solution of
        nutrients. The grain was dried before sowing. The farmers
        cultivated about 2,000 acres with the seed. The results were
        reported in </span><i style="font-family: Times New
        Roman,Times,serif;">Scientific American</i><span
        style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"> (15 February
        1919): </span><br style="font-family: Times New
        Roman,Times,serif;">
      <span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><br>
        "In the first place, there is a notable increase in the yield of
        grain from electrified seed... the yield of the electrified seed
        exceeds that of the unelectrified by from 4 to 16 bushels... The
        average... is between 25 and 30 % of increase... The increase in
        weight has ranged from 1 pound to as much as 4 pounds per
        bushel... Besides the increase in the bulk of the yield and the
        increase in the weight per bushel, there is an increase in the
        straw... whereas the bulk of the unelectrified seeds had thrown
        up only 2 straws per seed, the electrified had thrown up 5....
        The straw growing from the electrified seed is longer... The
        stoutness and the strength of the straw is increased... the crop
        is less likely to be laid by storms... Corn growing from seed
        thus treated is less susceptible to the attacks of fungus
        diseases and wireworm. </span><br style="font-family: Times New
        Roman,Times,serif;">
      <span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><br>
        "The effect produced upon the seed is not permanent; it will
        retain its enhanced efficiency only for about a month after
        electrification, if kept in a dry place. It is therefore
        desirable that the seed be sown promptly after it has been
        electrified... The grain must be steeped in water that contains
        in solution some salt [sodium nitrite] that will act as a
        conductor... The seed is steeped in it, and a weak current of
        electricity is passed by means of [iron] electrodes of large
        surface attached to two opposite end walls of the tank. The seed
        is then taken out and dried." </span><br style="font-family:
        Times New Roman,Times,serif;">
      <span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><br>
        Seed that is to be sown on one kind of soil will yield better
        results with a calcium salt, and seed that is to be sown on
        another kind of soil will yield better results with a sodium or
        other salt. One kind of seed will need treatment for so many
        hours, and another kind for many hours more or fewer. Barley,
        for instance, needs twice as long treatment as wheat or oats.
        The strength of the solution and the strength of the current
        must be appropriate, and are not necessarily the same in each
        case. The drying is very important. The seed must be dried at
        the right temperature, neither too rapidly nor too slowly; and
        it must be dried to the right degree, neither too much or too
        little. </span><b style="font-family: Times New

        In 1964, the USDA performed tests in which a negative electrode
        was placed high in a tree, and the positive electrode was
        connected to a nail driven into the base of the tree.
        Stimulation with 60 volts DC substantially increased leaf
        density on electrified branches after a month. Within a year,
        foliage increased 300% on those branches! </span><b

      <span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><br>
        Electricity also can cure trees of some diseases. A method was
        developed in 1966 to treat avocado trees affected with canker
        and orange trees with scaly bark. An electrode was inserted into
        the living cambium and phloem layers of the tree and the current
        passed into the branches, roots or soil. The treatment is best
        administered in the spring. The length of treatment depends on
        the size and condition of the tree. New shoots appeared after
        only one cycle of treatment. After the bark was removed, the
        trees began to bear fruit! The period of grafting stratification
        also can be shortened in this way. </span><br
        style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">
      <span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><br>
        The passage of an electric current modifies the physico-chemical
        properties of soil. Its aggregation increases, and its
        permeability to moisture is improved. The content of absorbable
        nitrogen, phosphorus, and other substances is increased. The pH
        changes. Usually, alkalinity is reduced, and evaporation
        increases. Both alternating and direct electric currents have a
        bacterial action which also affects the soil microflora. Up to
        95% of cabbage mildew and other bacteria and fungi can be
        destroyed by electrical disinfection. </span><br
        style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">
      <span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><br>
        Brief exposure of seeds to electric current ends their dormancy,
        accelerates development throughout the period of vegetation, and
        ultimately increases yields. The effect is greater with seeds
        that have a low rate of germination. The metabolism of seedlings
        is stimulated; respiration and hydrolytic enzyme activity is
        intensified for many types of plants. Lazarenko and

        When using AC, great care must be taken to prevent electrocution
        of oneself and the plants. AC generally tends to retard plant
        growth except within certain narrow parameters of voltage and
        amperage. Dicotyledon plants increase in weight at 10 KV and 100
        KV, but decrease in weight (as much as 45%) between 20 to 60 KV.
        Current must be very low, or plant growth will be retarded. </span><br

        L.E. Murr used aluminum wire mesh electrodes charged up to 60
        KV, and found that monocotyledons increase in dry weight in an
        electrostatic (ES) field, but decrease in weight in an
        oscillating field. The dry weight of dicots increases about 20%
        when grown in an oscillating field, but decreases above 50 KV.
        The concentration of minor elements (Fe, Zn, Al) increases
        several hundred percent in active leaf tips, due to an increase
        in oligo-enzymes. The activity of these substances is
        accelerated so much that cellular respiration is impeded,
        resulting in deterioration and death. There appears to be no
        benefit from continual exposure of plants to an alternating
        electrical field. If such a system is used, voltages should not
        exceed 10 KV, and the current must be very weak.</span><b

        The results can be worthwhile. In a similar system, the maximum
        energy supplied was 50 watts (50 KV/1 mA) per acre for 6 hours
        daily for 6 months. The total energy supplied was less than 0.2%
        of the energy actually absorbed by the plants from sunlight
        alone. Only a fraction of this additional energy was available
        to the plants, yet the increase averaged above 20%, up to 50%!
        Furthermore, it was found that an electrical discharge applied
        during the first month of the growing season may be as effective
        as continued treatment throughout the season. </span><br

        "After electric treatment of this type, an increase in their
        germination rate and, in particular, in the energy of
        germination was observed. The improvement was especially marked
        in the properties of seeds located on the negative electrode
        during treatment. In this case an increase in yield of 2-6
        centners/hectare was obtained with nearly all the conditions of
        treatment used. The increase in yield was smaller for plants
        whose seeds were treated on the positive electrode. Corn seeds,
        treated in a constant electric field, gave good yields which
        developed rapidly. Green tomatoes ripen faster if they are

        By this same method, it is possible to increase the power of
        germination of old seeds or seeds which are naturally difficult
        to germinate. Starch is increased, invert sugar is increased,
        and albumin is changed by such treatment. A greater percentage
        of treated seeds sprout sooner than untreated seeds.
        High-frequency ES fields also can be used either to inactivate
        or enhance enzymatic metabolism of fruits and vegetables, thus
        prolonging their stability, or hastening their ripening. In an
        ES field of 36 KV/m, the negative pole positioned above the
        seeds enhances their germination. The positive pole above the
        seeds inhibits germination. In the 1930s, V. Lebedev used very
        low power ultrashort waves to irradiate seeds, resulting in
        20-45% accelerated plant growth. Similar results were obtained
        with potato tubers, and gladiolus bulbs were grown without cold
        pre-treatment. </span><br style="font-family: Times New

        The effects are thought to be caused by conduction currents or
        dipole antenna resonance. The lethal effect begins at about 10.4
        meters wavelength (29 MHz) when the condensor plates are 2-3 cm
        apart. Other researchers have reported similar effects with the
        following parameters: Plates, 12 cm diameter; Current, 5.5 amps;
        Wavelength, 5.6 meters (50 MHz); Temperature, 30-40</span><sup
        style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">o</sup><span
        style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"> C. The lethal
        effects depend on the wavelength and the voltage gradient of the
        field strength (the distance between the condensor plates).
        Increasing either the frequency or the field strength while
        other factors remain constant increases the speed of the effect
        on pests. An increase of either factor requires more current,
        yet at certain frequencies (around 3 MHz), much less current is
        required for effective results (about 4 KV per linear inch). The
        higher the frequency, the shorter the lethal time. The thickness
        of the seeds and their moisture content also changes a lethal
        dose. The temperature of the seeds and pests may rise up to 60</span><sup

        Pittman discovered that the sexual determination of monoecious
        plants such as corn and cucumbers also is affected by the
        geomagnetic field: </span><br style="font-family: Times New
        Roman,Times,serif;">
      <span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><br>
        "If the embryo radical of such plants is oriented toward the
        North, a greater number of female flowers is formed than in the
        case of seeds oriented toward the South. Since cucumber fruits
        are produced from the female flower, Northward orientation of
        the seed radicals will lead, of course, to greater yield per
        plant." </span><br style="font-family: Times New
        Roman,Times,serif;">
      <span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><br>
        In general, Northward orientation of the embryonic&nbsp; radical
        (particularly of corn) promotes masculinity. The response of
        seeds when oriented toward the geomagnetic poles depends on the
        left- or right-handedness of the seed and the sexual
        characteristics of the plant type. When oriented with the tip of
        the embryo radical towards the S geomagnetic pole, l-rotary
        seeds demonstrate higher rates of growth, respiration, and
        enzymatic activity, and up to 50% greater yields. D-rotary seeds
        respond with up to 50% enhanced growth rates and yields when
        their embryo tips are pointed at the N pole. </span><br
        style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">
      <span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><br>
        When conifer seeds are grown with their embryo radicals oriented
        S, they germinate 4-5 days earlier than seeds oriented toward
        the N pole. Lunar phases also have a profound effect on the
        germination of conifers. They will sprout much faster when their
        embryo radicals are oriented S during a full moon, than they
        will if germinated during the new moon. </span><br
        style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">
      <span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><br>
        If there is any doubt about the directivity or gender of seeds,
        positive results can be obtained in any case by treating seeds
        for 2 weeks in the magnetic null, the quiet region where the
        magnetic pull is balanced between N and S. This region is
        located by observing the patterns formed by iron powder
        scattered on a glass pane placed over the magnet. </span><br
        style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">
      <span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><br>
        Pittman also grew potatoes from excised, magnetically treated
        eyes. The field-grown crop yielded 17% more marketable tubers
        that weighed 38.5% more than those grown from untreated eyes!
        Pittman concluded: </span><br style="font-family: Times New
        Roman,Times,serif;">
      <span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><br>
        "Pre-germination magnetic treatment of the eye may have effected
        a change in the metabolic process in the bud that eventually
        promoted earlier and greater tuber initiation. Tubers initiated
        early would have had more time to develop size than those
        initiated later." </span><br style="font-family: Times New
        Roman,Times,serif;">
      <span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><br>
        The exposure of seeds to magnetic fields also increases the
        percentage of germination of apricot and apple seeds, increases
        the yields of snap beans, accelerates the growth of legume and
        cereal seedlings, and the rate of tomato ripening. </span><br

        P.W. Ssawsotin reported that a low intensity (60 Oe) field may
        affect some biological processes as much as high intensity
        (1,600 Oe) magnets. Some of the effective "windows" are quite
        narrow. Strevoka, </span><i style="font-family: Times New

        Other Russian researchers found that wheat and barley seeds
        pre-magnetized (2,000 Oe) for 30 minutes with the major axis
        aligned with the magnetic flux will&nbsp; germinate much more
        vigorously than control seeds. Germination actually is retarded
        when seeds are aligned against the flux. Corn seeds respond

      <span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">"Even more

        Other experiments have shown that treatment of soil with

        A.V. Krylov also demonstrated magnetotropic phenomena in plants:
      </span><br style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">
      <span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><br>
        "Germination of seeds in a constant magnetic field accelerated
        growth of the shoots and rootlets and development of the plant,
        while an increase in its positive sign promoted aging, disease
        and death. Polarity also plays a role in plant immunity.
        Seedlings with their rootlets turned toward the N pole were
        thickly infested by parasites and molds, and the resistance of
        these seedlings was obviously depressed. The appearance of
        seedlings facing the S pole (with all other conditions the same)
        was completely different." </span><br style="font-family: Times

      <span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><br>
        In a 1,500 Oe field, the largest number of germinating seeds was
        found after an exposure of 10-30 and 300 minutes. Other gains
        were found at 2,800 Oe. If the magnetic field is too intense,
        germination can be retarded. Strevoka reported a contrary

        by John DeLand in the 1940s used magnetism to replace obnoxious
        smudge pots. He obtained high yields from orange trees formerly
        considered to be too old to be productive. The DeLand system can
        protect one acre of trees from frost, but it is ineffective for
        small plants. </span><br style="font-family: Times New
        Roman,Times,serif;">
      <span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><br>
        George van Tassel gave this description of the device: </span><br
        style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">
      <span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><br>
        "The DeLand Frost Guard Tower is about 32 feet high. It is
        composed of three 12-ft lengths of standard galvanized steel
        pipe. The lowest section is 2-inch pipe, set 3 ft deep in
        concrete. On top of this a 12-ft section of 1.5 inch pipe is
        screwed on by means of a reducer. Above this the top section of
        12-foot pipe, 1-inch in diameter, is screwed on by means of a
        reducer. Resting horizontally atop each reducer and at the mast
        head is a 1-ft diameter disk of waterproof, 3/4-inch plywood.
        Near the outer diameter of each plywood disk or collar is
        drilled 7 holes. These holes are parallel to the center mast and
        are equally spaced around the diameter, 51-1/2 degrees apart. </span><br
        style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">
      <span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><br>
        "Beginning at the top of the mast, with an extension of 6 or 7
        inches parallel to the ground, #10 gauge bare copper wires are
        run down through the concrete foundation's outer edge. From
        there they branch out, in 18-inch deep trenches, to a distance
        of not more than 144 ft from the mast's center. At this point,
        each wire is wrapped several times around an Alnico-V permanent
        magnet. The end of each wire is brought above ground and pointed
        back toward its other end on top of the tower. The magnet is
        given a coat of plastic to protect it from rust and to hold the
        windings in place. </span><br style="font-family: Times New
        Roman,Times,serif;">
      <span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><br>
        "The trenches and magnets are covered with earth. The 18-inch
        depth is to protect the wires from cultivation, they must remain
        uncut if the system is to function. One wire on the tower, and
        hence in the earth, must point toward magnetic North. The
        placing of this first magnet must be done very accurately, and
        the others should be accurately placed. </span><br
        style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">
      <span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">"The
        magnet sets are inclined toward the mast at 34 degrees to the
        surface of the ground. Pointing the buried bar magnets toward
        the North magnetic pole, but also setting them so they point or
        tilt toward the central mast gives a skew to the flux or flow of
        energy. </span><br style="font-family: Times New

      <span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><br>
        In the 1970s, A. Zaderej and C. Corson formed Intertec, Inc., to
        develop and market their "Electrogenic Seed Treatment". The
        Intertec system simulates a variety of atmospheric conditions
        are known to benefit plant development. The seeds are
        conditioned and rejuvenated, resulting in more rapid germination
        and increased yields. </span><br style="font-family: Times New
        Roman,Times,serif;">
      <span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><br>
        Seeds are sprayed with a solution of minerals and enzymes that
        is implanted into the seed coat by electrophoresis; this
        accelerates chromosomatic activity. A second exposure to high
        voltage negative ions increases the implantation. Then the seeds
        are exposed to infrared radiation in order to reduce the
        hard-seed dormancy and increase the metabolism of ATP. </span><br
        style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">
      <span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><br>
        The next stage uses an electrostatic charge to give cathodic
        protection. This reduces the mortality rate of seeds by
        providing a source of electrons to buffer the reaction with
        free-radical nutrient ions. Seeds must be moist when treated
        with cathodic protection. Dry seeds may be damaged by this
        treatment, but damaged seeds can be repaired somewhat if they
        are moistened. <br>
        Cathodic protection increases viability and germination up to
        200%. </span><span style="font-family: Times New
        Roman,Times,serif;">The final stage of the Electrogenic process
        treats seeds with select radio frequencies that stress the
        memory of DNA <br>
        molecules, charges the mitochondria, and intensifies other
        metabolic processes. This treatment increases the degree of
        water absorption, electrical conductivity, and oxygen uptake.
        The frequencies range from 800 KHz to 1.5 MHz with a field
        intensity of 3.2 W/sq cm. </span><br style="font-family: Times
        New Roman,Times,serif;">
      <span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><br>
        The seeds need to be treated at or near where they are to be
        sown. For some unknown reason, the effects of Electrogenic
        treatment apparently do not travel well. </span>

        The growth of plants can be stimulated by sound alone. The
        effect continues up to 50 KHz. Frequencies of 4-5 KHz are
        particularly effective for increasing germination, enzyme
        activity, and respiration. </span><br style="font-family: Times

      <span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><br>
        Normally, the streaming movement of protoplasm in plant cells
        slows down in the early morning and evening, but this streaming
        can be accelerated by an audio frequency generator used for 30
        minutes at a distance of about 5 feet from the plants. As a
        result, the amount and rate of growth increases. Plants should
        not be treated thus for more than 3 hours daily, or the plants
        are likely to die within a month or two, depending on the
        quality of the sound and its intensity. Very loud, high
        frequency sound causes cellular disruption and death. Some
        rock'n roll music also does so. </span><br style="font-family:

      <span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">A
        revolutionary process called "Sonic Bloom", invented by Dan
        Carlson, uses a 3 KHz tone (modulated to produce birdlike chirps
        and whistles) and a foliar spray (55 trace minerals, seaweed,
        gibberellin and amino acids) to produce "indeterminate growth in
        plants". His first success was with a Purple Passion houseplant
        that normally grows only about 18 inches. Under the influence of
        Sonic Bloom, the plant eventually grew over 1,200 feet, and
        earned itself a place in the </span><i style="font-family:

        style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">
      <span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><br>
        Growers using Sonic Bloom report dramatic increases in yield,
        better tasting vegetables and fruits, and more brilliant
        flowers. Cultivators can expect increased production and early
        maturity. Alfalfa sprouts will increase in weight by 1,200%
        within 3 days. The sprouts will have a much longer shelf life
        (2-3 weeks) than usual (3-4 days). Experiments with Sonic Bloom
        in Africa produced plants which survived extremely hot weather
        and flooding. Sonic Bloom also will produce fruit on first year
        trees. Apple farmers have reported triple-sized yields, 8-month
        shelf life, and a huge increase in nutrient values: 126% more
        potassium, 326% more chromium, 400% more iron, and 1,750% more
        zinc. Losses to diseases and pests have been reduced more than
        80%. Because Sonic Bloom contains Gibberilic Acid (GA3), it
        cannot be used indiscriminately with hemp, as GA3 strongl
        affects the development of cannabis. </span><br
        style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">
      <span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><br>
        Otherwise, the possibilities are unlimited. For example, Carlson
        says: </span><br style="font-family: Times New
        Roman,Times,serif;">
      <span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><br>
        One of our greatest breakthroughs to make everyone understand
        how easy it is to feed large amounts of people, involved a
        sucker on a tomato. A sucker is normally a sterile branch which
        appears in between a side shoot and the main branch. Our tomato
        plants grow 2 inches a day so if we allow a sucker to grow for
        seven days, it's about 14 inches long. If we then cut it off,
        put it in the shade and spray it once a day with a 1/4 ounce per
        gallon solution of Sonic Bloom, in 10-14 days it becomes fully
        rooted and starts to grow 2 inches per day. Fifty-five days
        later, it is 7-9 feet tall. Now, normal production on tomatoes
        is 90 days. We're doing this in less than 55, plus we're
        producing at least twice as much fruit in almost half the time."
      </span><br style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">
      <span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><br>
        Water is added to the concentrated Sonic Bloom formula. The
        cassette (containing a 3 KHz signal and nature sounds) is played
        at high volume with high treble and medium bass for 10 minutes
        before spraying the plants. The plants are then sprayed while
        the cassette is playing, and the sound is continued for another
        20 minutes after spraying. Both sides of the leaves should be
        saturated. Treatment is best performed early in the morning
        (before 9 am), preferably in foggy weather. On cold mornings,
        spraying should be delayed until late afternoon. Do not spray
        plants when the temperature falls below 50</span><sup
        style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">o</sup><span
        style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"> F. The
        formula also can be administered in the regular weather supply,
        by drip-feeding, hydroponics, etc. The nutrient solution should
        be applied once a month for the first month, then twice weekly
        thereafter. Seeds should be soaked in dilute nutrient solution
        for 8 hours or overnight while the sound tape is played
        continuously on a cassette deck with auto-reverse capability.
        Plant the seeds immediately. The tape ought to be played daily
        for at least 30 minutes during daylight hours. </span>

        Plants respond to light with a complex variety of reactions that
        are affected by the duration (photoperiod), intensity, and
        wavelength of the light. During the 19th century, Edward Babbitt
        and others reported that the germination of seeds increases by
        50% under the influence of blue light (provided by blue glass
        filters). Plant vitality is increased, growth is accelerated,
        stem and leaf development are improved, and yields are
        increased. </span><br style="font-family: Times New

        In 1861, General A.J. Pleasanton constructed a 2,200 sq ft
        greenhouse in which every eighth pane was blue. Pleasanton
        obtained phenomenal results in terms of increased yields,
        improved flavor, etc, and he received US Patent # 119,242 for
        "Improvements in Accelerating the Growth of Plants and Animals."
        He recommended a ratio of white 8:1 blue light for optimal plant
        growth, and a ration of 1:1 for best animal development. Blue
        light stimulates the directional response of plants to light.
        Plants' pores open more widely in the presence of blue light
        (use it with Sonic Bloom). Evaporation and photosynthesis are
        intensified and chlorophyll production is accelerated. Some
        cells may rupture, however, and mitosis may be inhibited. </span><br

        The He-Ne laser (632.8 nm) can influence the
        phytochrome-controlled germination, growth and development of
        plants from a distance of more than a quarter-mile. The maximum
        effect is obtained by only 1 or 2 minutes of exposure to
        reflected laser light. More than 10 minutes of irradiation will
        inhibit the phytochrome response. In some cases, successive
        nightly irradiations of low intensity have a significantly
        greater effect than a single exposure of greater length or
        intensity. The response can be reversed by alternating exposure
        to laser and infrared light. </span><b style="font-family:

        treatment improved the sowing qualities of the seeds, shortened

        and increased the yields of both stems and seeds to a
        considerable extent</b><span style="font-family: Times New
        Roman,Times,serif;">. The researchers used a He-Ne laser for 15
        and 30 minutes, and a nitrogen laser with 225 and 450 impulses.

        Red light can be used to increase the growth of some plants
        (beans, etc.) up to ten times the normal rate by stimulating
        phytochrome activity. Red light at 660 nm stimulates growth,
        development, flowering, and fruiting. When red light at 700 nm
        is available with 650 nm red light, photosynthetic activity is
        considerably greater than with either single frequency. Blue
        light at 420 nm enhances the effect of 650 nm red light.
        Photosynthesis occurs at approximately 440 nm. </span><br
        style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">
      <span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><br>
        Photosynthesis can be increased up to 400% by means of
        intermittent light. The researchers used a rotating disk with a
        cut-out section to chop the light from a lamp. They found that
        75% of the light from a given source could be blocked without
        decreasing the rate of photosynthesis. The improved yields
        produced by intermittent light depends on the frequency of the
        flashing. A frequency of 4 flashes/minute resulted in 100%
        increased yields. The amount of work done by the light can be
        increased by shortening both the light and dark periods. For
        example, yields can be increased 100% by using 133
        flashes/second. Emerson and Williams improved the yield
        (compared to continuous light) by 400% by using only 50
        flashes/second. The light flashes must be much shorter than the
        dark period. The minimum dark period is about 0.03 at 25</span><sup
        style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">o</sup><span
        style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"> C. The light
        reaction begins with about 0.001 second/flash, and it depends on
        the concentration of carbon dioxide. </span><br

        A. Shakhov, </span><i style="font-family: Times New
        Roman,Times,serif;">et al</i><span style="font-family: Times New
        Roman,Times,serif;">., developed several methods of applying
        Concentrated Pulsed Sunlight (CPSL) to stimulate the
        photoenergetic activity of seeds and plants. The flashes of CPSL
        last from 0.2 to 1 second and produce significant effects on
        physiological processes and increase plant productivity. The
        CPSL effect is not caused by the thermal action of concentrated
        light, but by endowing plants with a "photoenergy reserve" that
        increases yields of vegetable crops by 20-30%, and grain crops
        by 5-10%. </span><br style="font-family: Times New

      <span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><br>
        Arrays of aluminum and glass dishes are used to concentrate
        sunlight up to 100 times. The apparatus is shaken lightly by
        various means to pulse the irradiation as it is directed on
        seeds or plants. In one such device, a large semi-conical
        aluminum reflector is rotated by a motor at 100-130 rpm. The
        seeds arrange themselves in a single layer on the wall of the
        pan and receive intermittent irradiation as they pass through a
        fixed focal spot on the inside wall. Artificial lighting (70,000
        lux) pulsed 120 flashes/min. was found to produce effects even
        though the light energy was much lower than that of CPSL. With
        duckweed, maximum growth was obtained with a pulse period of
        0.004 second. </span><br style="font-family: Times New

      <span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><br>
        Another system uses tinted mirrors to produce single colors.
        S.A. Stanko irradiated soy plants with pulsed red light for 30
        min/day for a week, resulting in a 8% increase in the protein
        content of the beans. </span><br style="font-family: Times New

      <span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><br>
        Thomas G. Hieronymous discovered that a plant can be grown in
        complete darkness indoors if it is connected by an insulated
        wire to a large metal surface that is exposed to sunlight. The
        plant must be at least 6 feet above ground and insulated to
        generate a voltage potential or antenna effect. The optimal size
        of the metal sheet must be determined by experiment so as to
        avoid sunburn (too large) or yellowing (too small). Plants
        cultivated in this manner will develop normally, while control
        plants will be stunted. </span>

      <span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">Dr.
        Wilhelm Reich (of Orgone fame) also found that plants could be
        grown without light if they were grown with magnetite that had
        been exposed to sunlight. The magnetite absorbs and reradiates
        solar energies that are utilized by plants. </span>
