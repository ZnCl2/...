HEMP FOR FREEDOM</b> </p>

(Also called "Hemp Doodle"; written originally to the tune of "Yankee
Doodle". Any upbeat tune of similiar rhythm will work.)</p>
  </center>
  <p><br>
  </p>
  <p>Here's a song about that plant <br>
you're not supposed t' inhale, <br>
'cause it could get your body tossed <br>
into some boring jail. </p>
  <p>Which could pretty much block your view <br>
of the beauties of the world, <br>
making it harder though not impossible <br>
to get your wings unfurled. </p>
  <p>Hemp served Man since ancient times, <br>
though it's gone out of favor. <br>
But America's in such a fix <br>
now only hemp can save her. </p>
  <p>Food and fuel and shelter and medicine <br>
when we really need 'em; <br>
once again the mighty hemp <br>
could help us gain our freedom. </p>
  <p>The world's first paper was made from hemp, <br>
so literacy could spread. <br>
Now wise old guys could tell us lies, <br>
even when they're dead. </p>
  <p>Of course they could also share some truths, <br>
if they happened to know any. <br>
The point is when they printed their books on hemp, <br>
no one told 'em not to grow any. </p>
  <p>Our ancestors barely made it here <br>
on ships with canvas sails, <br>
rollin' and bouncin' and heavin' and barfin' <br>
and greatly amusing the whales. </p>
  <p>Canvas means cannabis and that means hemp, <br>
the first cloth to cross the ocean. <br>
Salt rots the other fibers halfway over <br>
and halts your forward motion. </p>
  <p>That's right folks, without that hemp <br>
we never could have come here. <br>
Now there's some who want to eradicate <br>
the species from here. </p>
  <p>The DEA can yank it up, <br>
yank it up right handy, <br>
but when the famine strikes our land, <br>
they'll eat hemp seeds like candy. </p>
  <p>Oh you can bet when the big drought hits, <br>
any narc'll turn to a hemp farmer. <br>
If your kids were starving <br>
wouldn't you let down your armor? </p>
  <p>Hemp has roots that reach way down <br>
to raise the deepest waters, <br>
to grow the seeds that you will need <br>
to feed your sons and daughters. </p>
  <p>Before petroleum took over <br>
hemp seed oil was its main competition. <br>
Then petro-chemical and timber barons <br>
arranged for its prohibition. </p>
  <p>To this day legalizing hemp's what <br>
oil barons fear the most. <br>
If people grow their own fuel in their back yards, <br>
the energy monopoly's toast. </p>
  <p>So don't send your kids to fight for oil; <br>
there are better choices. <br>
Hemp seed oil could run your cars <br>
if you all raise your voices. </p>
  <p>And hemp seed has nearly all the nutrients <br>
human bodies need, <br>
much better than those over-used soybeans <br>
meant for cattle feed. </p>
  <p>Fresh hemp seeds are tasty and healthy <br>
and help you to keep your grin on, <br>
while soybeans, unless you spice the daylights out of 'em, <br>
taste like the dirt they rode in on. </p>
  <p>For thousands of years humans ate hemp seeds, <br>
more protein than any other crop. <br>
The single worst special interest legislation of all time <br>
ordered everybody to stop. </p>
  <p>Greed unbound, on the flimsiest ground, <br>
to create resource monopolies, <br>
asked real polite if it'd be alright <br>
if they banned our most useful crop, please? </p>
  <p>Well no, actually, what they did was re-label <br>
hemp as marijuana, <br>
exploiting racist fears and guaranteeing tears, <br>
and lots of homeless flora and fauna. </p>
  <p>Hemp still makes better paper and building material <br>
stronger than lumber. <br>
But hemp prohibition left us grinding up our trees <br>
and seriously reducing their number. </p>
  <p>The first people who lived here warned us: <br>
Don't cut down the big trees. <br>
They're what holds the land to the sky, <br>
safe above the seas. </p>
  <p>They also make the air we breathe; <br>
too bad we did not listen. <br>
Folks will be turning several shades of blue <br>
when they notice what is missin'. </p>
  <p>Where did you think that oxygen <br>
you're fond of breathing comes from? <br>
When you can't pay your oxygen bill, <br>
well good luck trying to bum some. </p>
  <p>Half an eco-system does not work; <br>
don't even try it. <br>
If too many big trees get cut down, <br>
things could get rather quiet. </p>
  <p>Takes a mighty big blind spot to look up at a <br>
thousand year-old being, <br>
if the money you can get for chopping up its body <br>
is the only thing you're seeing. </p>
  <p>Keep killing those who make your oxygen, <br>
eventually you'll strangle. <br>
Oh say can you see that slender thread <br>
from which your lives now dangle? </p>
  <p>Now it may seem like we've wandered quite a way <br>
from the original point. <br>
But there's a whole lot more to hemp <br>
than "Hey let's smoke a joint". </p>
  <p>Everything the kids need is getting scarcer; <br>
instead they're getting stuck with the debt. <br>
No wonder they've been forming gangs <br>
and acting slightly upset. </p>
  <p>So if you don't want your children thinking <br>
that you totally blew it, <br>
better let them grow that hemp; <br>
it just might see them through it. </p>
  <p>We can still get back in Mother Nature's good graces <br>
just when it looked like we'd lost her, <br>
but we'll need leaders who don't prefer <br>
a cranio-rectal posture. </p>
  <p>Washington, Jefferson, Franklin and <br>
some other founding fathers <br>
smoked their hemp and dreamed up a nation <br>
freer than many others. </p>
  <p>We fought for independence when <br>
King George the third decreed, <br>
the colonies must buy from England <br>
everything they need. </p>
  <p>Well that didn't go over too well, <br>
so we had us a boycott. <br>
We stopped buying British clothes, <br>
made our own from hemp, then we fought. </p>
  <p>Hemp provided our ropes and sails, <br>
and the cloth for Old Glory; <br>
lamp oil and tents, America's hemp <br>
was a vital part of her story. </p>
  <p>Nowadays visionary leaders are scarce; <br>
it's all about greed and combat. <br>
There's more imagination apparent <br>
in your average wombat. </p>
  <p>So if you people want to legalize hemp, <br>
you'll have to stand up and mention it, <br>
though the men with the energy monopoly machine <br>
probly won't appreciate a wrench in it. </p>
  <p>TV experts claim marijuana <br>
will give your brain a frying, <br>
but a lethal dose has never been found, <br>
though not for lack of trying. </p>
  <p>Neuro-scientists have found <br>
receptors in our brains, <br>
specially shaped for THC, <br>
to loosen our thought chains. </p>
  <p>Silicon Valley innovators, <br>
most of them were stoners. <br>
Wall Street saw what they'd invented <br>
and got giant boners. </p>
  <p>Okay that was utterly tasteless <br>
and we're really sorry. <br>
Blame it on that hemp we used to smoke <br>
like there was no tomorry. </p>
  <p>Pseudo-scientific balderdash <br>
from Washington; <br>
Their plans for you do not include <br>
large amounts of fun. </p>
  <p>But self-appointed royalty can be retired <br>
without wrecking the castle. <br>
A reasonable amnesty and a fresh start <br>
could save a lot of hassle. </p>
  <p>Some people who can't control themselves <br>
get obsessed about controlling others. <br>
They're missing the part that would let them see <br>
all men are really brothers. </p>
  <p>The condition causing their misbehavior <br>
isn't their fault in all fairness. <br>
Cut off from infinity, their eyes are on the wrong prize <br>
instead of on higher awareness. </p>
  <p>With all the distractions, it's easy to forget, <br>
you're a luminous being. <br>
Trillions of filaments of light flow through your bright spot <br>
to make the world you're seeing. </p>
  <p>Move that spot and different filaments <br>
change the reality you're viewing. <br>
Alter your perception any way you choose, <br>
that's ultimately what you're doing. </p>
  <p>So even without knowing about 'em people still <br>
want to move their assemblage points. <br>
And that, boys and girls, is the fundamental reason <br>
why some folks like to smoke joints. </p>
  <p>But when it wears off, the familiar world <br>
seems solider than before. <br>
To raise your awareness beyond your dreams, <br>
try a whole different door. </p>
  <p>Learn the Magical Passes and find out <br>
what you can become. <br>
They say if your only tool is a hammer, <br>
you'll probably whack your thumb. </p>
  <p>Wait that's not it, something 'bout a nail, <br>
oh yeah, everything looks like one. <br>
When all the race cars ran out of gas, <br>
the little kid on the trike won. </p>
  <p>Let's have no more artificially <br>
created scarcity; <br>
Earth provides and Nature guides, <br>
is how it's meant to be. </p>
  <p>There's still time for humans to grow up <br>
and dodge that cosmic knife. <br>
Either way it's time now for us to dive back <br>
into the river of life. </p>
