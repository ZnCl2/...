      <b>Cannabis sativa</b>, the "True Hemp", is tightly woven into the
      tapestry of human life. Since earliest times, this great plant
      ally has provided people with cordage and fabric, paper, medicine,
      and inspiration. For all the many benefits it bestows, Cannabis
      hemp is a friendship well worth cultivating. Hemp is many things
      to many people, and it is known by hundreds of names. Poets and
      musicians sing its praises, and preachers damn it. Executioners
      hang condemned men with hemp rope, but sailors and mountaineers
      hang onto it for dear life. Doctors prescribe it as a versatile
      medicine, yet prohibitionists proscribe it as a poison. Armies and
      navies make war with hemp, while lovers use it as an aphrodisiac.
      It is the warp of the mind&#8217;s veil of illusion, and the woof of
      politicians, who "lead us in the manner dogs lead a parade" (Mark
      Twain). The resinous virtue generates real happiness,
      enlightenment and entertainment, equal in quality and worth to the
      similar joys of love, freedom and good health --- and it
      complements them all, and comforts those without such blessings.
      Hemp is a most interesting and paradoxical plant, one that defies
      control and begs understanding. Hemp is one of mankind&#8217;s best (and
      few) friends on Earth, yet it is held prisoner within its own
      cells, bound in a Gordian Knot of laws. Yet again, it is Ariadne&#8217;s
      Thread, a guideline out of the labyrinth of bureaucratic tyranny
      and into a new state of liberty and grace. We should be thankful
      for Cannabis.

      <p><b>1.</b> <br>
        <a name="hhl1"></a><b>Traditional Materia Medica</b> </p>
      <p>Cannabis has been used in medicine since about 2300 BC, when
        the legendary Chinese Emperor Shen-Nung prescribed <i>chu-ma</i>
        (female hemp) for the treatment of constipation, gout, beriberi,
        malaria, rheumatism, and menstrual problems. He classified <i>chu-ma</i>
        as one of the Superior Elixirs of Immortality. In the 2nd
        century AD, the renowned physician Hua Tuo formulated <i>ma-yo</i>
        (hemp wine) and <i>ma-fei-san</i> (hemp-boiling powder) as
        anesthetics for the many surgeries he performed. The 14th
        century text <i>Ri-Yong-Ben-Cao</i> (<i>Household Materia
          Medica</i>) by Wu Rui described the use of hempseed as a
        medicine. </p>
      <p>Chinese herbalists recommend <i>huo ma ren</i> ("fire hemp
        seeds") in doses from 9-15 grams, up to 45 grams, to nourish the
        Yin (feminine) in cases of constipation in the elderly, "blood
        deficiency", and to recuperate from febrile diseases. Hempseed
        is "sweet" and "neutral" and "clears heat". It operates through
        the channels of the stomach, large intestine, and spleen. It
        promotes the healing of sores and ulcerations when applied
        topically or ingested. Excessive, prolonged use may result in
        "vaginal discharge" or spermatorrhea. <b>(1)</b> </p>
      <p>Both the ancient Ayurvedic system of Indian medicine and the
        Arabic Unani Tibbi system make extensive use of hemp for
        healing. Usually, it is mixed with other vegetable, mineral and
        animal substances which neutralize the narcotic effects and
        enhance the therapeutic virtues. The 9th century medical text <i>Susruta


          Samhita</i> describes bhang as an anti-phlegmatic against
        catarrh. The Sanskrit book <i>Rajbulubha</i> recommends hemp
        for the treatment of gonorrhea. The 10th century treatise <i>Anandakanda



        </i>describes the rejuvenating qualities of cannabis: </p>
      <p><i>"Bahnagini</i> is that which breaks the three types of
        miseries... gives happiness to mind... gives pleasure, lustre,
        intoxication and beauty... intoxicates like alcohol... helps to
        overcome death... helps in the excretion of nectar located at
        the <i>Brahmarandhra</i>... accomplishes the objects of mind...
        liberates living creatures from the bonds of the world... cures
        all diseases... has attained <i>siddhi</i> [spiritual
        perfections]... and endows <i>siddhi</i> on others." </p>
      <p>Ayurvedic physicians regularly use the juice of hemp to treat
        dozens of diseases and other medical problems including
        diarrhea, epilepsy, delirium and insanity, colic, rheumatism,
        gastritis, anorexia, consumption, fistula, nausea, fever,
        jaundice, bronchitis, leprosy, spleen disorders diabetes, cold,
        anemia, menstrual pain, tuberculosis, elephantiasis, asthma,
        gout, constipation, and malaria. <b>(2, 3)</b> </p>
      <p>The <i>Materia Medica of the Hindus</i> (1877) states: </p>
      <p>"The leaves of Cannabis sativa are purified by boiling in milk
        before use. They are regarded as heating, digestive, astringent,
        and narcotic [sleep-inducing]. The intoxication induced by <i>bhang</i>
        is said to be of a pleasant description and to promote
        talkativeness. In sleeplessness, the powder of the dried resin
        is given in suitable doses for inducing sleep or removing pain."
        <b>(4)</b> </p>
      <p>The ancient Egyptian Ebers Papyrus (E.821) offers "A remedy to
        cool the uterus": </p>
      <p><i>"Smsm t</i> [hemp] is pounded in honey and administered to
        the vagina. This is a contraction." </p>
      <p>A mixture of hemp and carob was employed as an enema, or
        combined with other ingredients for use as a poultice (E. 618).
        The Ramses III Papyrus (A. 26) offers an prescription that is
        prescient of the modern use of cannabis in the treatment of
        glaucoma: </p>
      <p>"A treatment for the eyes: celery; <i>smsm t</i> is ground and
        left in the dew overnight. Both eyes of the patient are to be
        washed with it in the morning." <b>(5)</b> </p>
      <p>The Greek physician Pedacius Dioscorides (1st cty. AD)
        described <i>kannabis emeros</i> (female) in <i>De Materia
          Medica</i> (3:165, 166): </p>
      <p>"The round seed, which being eaten of much doth quench
        geniture, but being juiced when it is green is good for the
        pains of the ears... The root being sodden, and so laid on hath
        ye force to assuage inflammations and to dissolve Oedemata, and
        to disperse ye obdurate matter about ye joints." </p>
      <p>The 16th century humorist Francois Rabelais heaped praise on
        Pantagruelion (hemp) in giving passing notice of its healing
        properties in his novel <i>Gargantua and Pantagruel</i>: </p>
      <p>"I won't stop to tell you how the juice of this marvelous herb,
        squeezed out and placed in the ears, kills every manner of
        putrefied vermin that could possibly have bred in there, as well
        as all other creatures that might have crawled in. Put this
        juice in a small pail of water and you'll see the water suddenly
        coagulates like clotted milk --- that's how powerful it is. And
        this coagulated water is a sovereign remedy for colicky horses,
        and also those with short breath... </p>
      <p>"If you want to cure a burn, no matter whether it be from
        boiling water or burning wood, just rub on raw Pantagruelion,
        just as it comes out of the earth, without doing anything else.
        But be careful to change the dressing, when you see it drying on
        the wound.." <b>(6)</b> </p>
      <p>Hemp was a popular remedy in medieval Europe. In addition to
        the applications mentioned above, the herb was used to treat
        toothaches, to facilitate childbirth, to alleviate convulsions,
        fevers, inflammations, jaundice, and reduce swollen joints in
        arthritis and rheumatism. Cannabis was found worthy of honorable
        mention as a healing plant in several medieval herbals. </p>
      <p>In the 18th century treatise <i>Hemp</i> by M. Marcandier,
        readers are reminded: </p>
      <p>"Pliny tells us, the Hemp-seed is of a drying nature, that it
        weakens the generative powers in men when they eat it to excess.
        On the contrary, it promotes fruitfulness in fowls, for which
        reason it is purposely given them in winter time, and is a food
        to which birds are accustomed. It expels wind; is hard of
        digestion and disagrees with the stomach; it produces bad
        humour, and occasions headaches. It was formerly one of those
        legumes, which are fried for desserts: It was also made into
        little sweet cakes, to be eaten at collations, and to promote
        drinking; but at present, this unwholesome ragout is quite
        banished from our tables: It heats those that it too freely so
        much, that it occasions very dangerous vapours; so that those
        who prescribe a decoction of this seed to children that labour
        under epilepsies, far from procuring them relief, increase and
        irritate their disorder. The juice of it, squeezed out when it
        is green, draws insects to it, and brings out all the vermin
        that enter into the ears, and infest them. Taken in an emulsion,
        it is good against a cough and the jaundice, and also against
        the gonorrhea; its oil is recommended as an ingredient in
        pomatums for the small-pox; and it is laxative. Taken inwardly,
        or outwardly applied, it has not the dangerous qualities that
        are ascribed to the whole plant with its leaves; the powder of
        it mixt with drink, will make those who use it drunk, dull, and
        stupid: We are told that the Arabians make a sort of wine of it,
        which intoxicates, and poor people eat the oil of it in their
        soup. </p>
      <p>"The grain and the leaves being squeezed, while they are green,
        and applied, by way of cataplasm, to painful tumors, are
        reckoned to have a great power of relaxing and stupefying...
        What Pliny assures us, of the great effect which an infusion of
        Hemp may have in coagulating water, will not appear surprising
        if we attend to the quality and quantity of the gum, which
        unites all the fibres of this plant together... It is,
        doubtless, for this reason, that it is given in drink to cattle
        to cure looseness. The decoction of green Hemp, with its seed,
        when well cleared of the dregs, causes the worms to come out of
        the ground on which it is poured, and the fishermen commonly
        make use of this expedient to catch them, when they have
        occasion... </p>
      <p>"It abates inflammations, dissolves tumors and hard swellings
        upon the joints. Beat and pounded in a mortar, with butter, when
        it is still fresh, it is applied to burns, which it relieves
        greatly when it is often renewed. The juice and decoction of it,
        put into the fundaments of horses, brings out the vermin that
        infest them." </p>
      <p>In his <i>Herbal</i>, Nicholas Culpepper (1616-1654) advised
        readers thus: </p>
      <p>"An emulsion or decoction of the seed... eases the colic and
        always the troublesome humours in the bowels and stays bleeding
        at the mouth, nose, and other places." </p>
      <p>Cannabis offers other mercies. In the 1830s, Dr. William
        O'Shaugnessy administered 2 grains of the resin to alleviate the
        suffering of a man dying of hydrophobia: </p>
      <p>"In reviewing... this interesting case, it seems evident that
        at least one advantage was gained from the use of the remedy;
        the awful malady was stripped of its horrors; if not less fatal
        than before, it was reduced to less than the scale of suffering
        which precedes death from most ordinary diseases." <b>(7)</b> </p>
      <p>Cannabis also was reported to be useful with varying degrees of
        success in the treatment of alcoholism, asthma, bronchitis,
        constipation, diarrhea, dysentery, dysmenorrhea and uterine
        hemorrhage, dropsy or edema, epilepsy, insanity, migraine,
        palsy, rheumatism, anthrax, beriberi, blood poisoning,
        incontinence, leprosy, malaria, snakebite, tonsillitis,
        parasites, and a legion of other maladies. <b>(8-11)</b> </p>
      <p>In the late 19th century, cannabis was included in dozens of
        remedies available by prescription or over-the-counter. Reports
        of "cannabis poisoning" began to concern doctors. But V.
        Robinson noted in <i>An Essay on Hasheesh</i> (1912): </p>
      <p>"An overdose has never produced death in man or the lower
        animals. Not one authenticated case is on record in which
        Cannabis or any of its preparations destroyed life... Cannabis
        does not seem capable of causing death by its chemical or
        physiological action."<b> (12)</b> </p>

      <p>After it was criminalized by the Marijuana Tax of 1937,
        cannabis was deleted from the British and US <i>Pharmacopoeia</i>,<i>
          Merck Index</i>, etc.. Despite governmental efforts to
        suppress the plant, people have continued to rediscover the
        medical benefits of cannabis, and thousands of scientific
        articles have been published to that effect. Dozens of
        therapeutic effects have been reported for the major
        cannabinoids, TetraHydroCannabinol (THC), Cannabinol (CBN), and
        Cannabidiol (CBD)<b>(Fig. 2)</b> </p>
      <p><b>2a.</b> <br>
        <a name="hhl2a"></a><b><i>Glaucoma</i></b>: --- Several million
        people worldwide are afflicted with glaucoma, in which the
        unchecked rise of intraocular pressure (IOP) causes irreparable
        damage of the retina and optic nerve, resulting in blindness.
        About 250,000 Americans suffer from glaucoma, and several
        thousand people go blind from the affliction each year in the
        USA. Glaucoma is somewhat controllable with medications, all of
        which are attended by dangerous side-effects -- with the
        exemption of cannabis. </p>
      <p>In 1971, while conducting an experiment to determine whether
        cannabis dilated the pupils, R.S. Hepler and I.M. Frank chanced
        to notice that the smoking of marijuana reduced IOP by about 25%
        after 30 minutes. In addition, there was a 50% reduction in tear
        flow and in ocular pulse pressure. Subsequent studies confirmed
        this effect with THC and cannabis extracts administered orally,
        intravenously, or by topical application of THC in sesame oil.
        There is no development of tolerance.&nbsp; <b>(13-15)</b> </p>
      <p>The mechanism of this effect is uncertain, but it is known that
        THC increases the outflow facility of the eyes and reduces the
        secretion of ocular fluid by constricting the blood vessels of
        the ciliary epithelium. CBD has no effect on IOP. Cannabis is
        known to produce tears and mild reddening of the conjunctiva,
        but these effects have little apparent clinical significance. </p>
      <p>In a contrary finding, W. Daeson, <i>et al</i>., reported that
        chronic users in Costa Rica had increased IOP and an apparently
        incorrectable optical acuity deficit. A case of conjugate
        deviation of the eyes reportedly was caused by cannabis
        intoxication, according to Mohan and Sood. The effect lasted six
        weeks. <b>(16, 17)</b> </p>
      <p>Dr. M.E. West confirmed the Jamaican folk belief that a
        run-extract of cannabis improves night-vision. Dr. West and Dr.
        Albert Lockhart eventually prepared a non-pyschoactive
        substance, called Canasol, which showed a marked improvement on
        IOP and "significant improvement in night vision." <b>(18, 19)</b>
      </p>
      <p>The report by West and Lockhart prompted Keith Green, <i>et al</i>.,
to



        isolate and test water-soluble extracts of cannabis for
        IOP-reducing activity. Some compounds were found to reduce IOP
        by about 60% for up to 60 hours with doses as low as 1
        microgram, administered intravenously. Other routes of
        administration are ineffective, due to the extremely large size
        of the glyco-protein molecules.&nbsp; <b>(20-22)</b> </p>
      <p><b>2b.</b> <br>
        <a name="hhl2b"></a><b><i>Anti-Emetic </i></b>--- In the 1970s,
        many patients undergoing chemotherapy for AIDS, Hodgkins disease
        and other cancers discovered that they suffered less nausea and
        vomiting if they smoked marijuana before receiving treatment.
        Subsequent tests by several oncologists showed THC to be
        superior to chlorperazine as an anti-emetic, but no more
        effective than metoclopramide or thiethylperazine. In other
        trials, no difference was found between the anti-emetic effects
        of THC. The emesis produced by methroxate, duxorubium,
        cyclophosphamide and flouracil are dramatically reduced by THC.
        It is less beneficial for patients receiving mustine,
        nitrosoureas, and cisplatin therapy. The synthetic cannabinoid
        Nabilone was found to be more effective than prochlorperazine as
        an anti-emetic in cisplatin treatment. The side-effects of being
        "high", dysphoric, sedated, etc., are tolerated better by young
        persons than by elders. The synthetic THC analog Levonantradol
        is known to possess anti-emetic activity while producing only
        mild side effects. Sallan, <i>et al</i>., found that nausea an
        vomiting was controlled by THC in 81% of patients. <b>(23-27)</b>
      </p>
      <p>Chemotherapy patients who use cannabis as medicine generally
        prefer to smoke marijuana rather than ingest synthetic THC
        (Marinol) because they usually vomit before the pill can take
        effect (up to 3 hours later). Smoking allows the patient to
        titrate the dose puff by puff, and the drug takes effect within
        a few minutes. Synthetic THC loses its effectiveness after only
        a few treatments, and it is expensive. Alternatively, it is a
        simple matter to prepare an extract with clarified butter. This
        is administered in suppository capsules with pinholes poked in
        them. </p>
      <p>Harvard University surveyed members of the American Society of
        Clinical Oncology in 1990, and found that 44% of the 1,035
        respondents acknowledged that they had recommended the illegal
        use of marijuana to at least one patient undergoing
        chemotherapy. 48% agreed that they "would prescribe marijuana in
        smoked form to some of their patients if it were illegal." <b>(28)</b>

        <a name="hhl2c"></a><b><i>Asthma </i></b>--- For the past 3,000
        years or more, cannabis has provided welcome relief for
        countless numbers of asthmatics. It was widely used for that
        purpose in the 19th century. The inhalation of marijuana smoke
        causes bronchial dilation lasting up to 1 hour. The
        bronchodilator effect of orally-ingested THC lasts up to 6
        hours, but it is not so powerful as smoking marijuana. THC
        aerosols are not so effective as smoking marijuana because
        aerosolized THC has an irritating effect on the air passages. <b>(29)</b>
      </p>
      <p>L. Vachon, <i>et al</i>., reported that 0.7 mg. THC in a
        micro-aerosol proved to be up to 60% effective as a
        bronchodilator, with minimal mental effects and no
        parasympathetic effects. J. Hartley, <i>et al</i>., found that
        administration of minute doses (50-200 micrograms) of THC by
        inhalation increased the peak expiratory flow and forced
        expiratory volume in 1 second in a dose-related manner. The
        effects last 4 hours. D. Tashkin, <i>et al</i>., explored the
        anti-asthmatic effect of THC, and found it to be useful against
        the encroachment of emphysema. R. Gordon, <i>et al</i>.,
        confirmed the anti-tussive effect. Cannabis also has been used
        with success in the treatment of whooping cough. In 1955, J.
        Sirek reported on the importance of hempseed in tuberculosis
        therapy, but the discovery has been largely ignored since then.

        <a name="hhl2d"></a><b><i>Anti-Convulsant </i></b>--- Cannabis'
        power to control spasticity and convulsions has been applied in
        folk medicine for thousands of years. The first European report
        of this effect was published in the 1830s by Dr. William
        O'Shaughnessy, who stated that "The [medical] profession has
        gained an anti-convulsive remedy of the greatest value." Dr. J.
        Russell Reynolds, who was Queen Victoria's personal physician
        for 30 years and administered cannabis to her, praised the
        anti-convulsive virtue of hemp. He wrote that "There are many
        cases of so-called epilepsy... in which India hemp is the most
        useful agent with which I am acquainted." <b>(35, 36)</b> </p>
      <p>Many thousands of victims of all forms of convulsions,
        spasticity, and epilepsy, and of paralysis --- paraplegia,
        quadriplegia, Muscular Dystrophy (MD), Multiple Sclerosis (MS),
        and chorea, etc., and the associated neuralgias --- praise
        cannabis for its unique&nbsp; power of relaxation. Anecdotal
        reports of its efficacy prompted clinical studies which showed
        that Cannabidiol can help some patients to remain nearly free of
        convulsions without any toxicity or psychoactive side-effects.
        W.A. Check found a limited effect of smoking marijuana to
        alleviate the spasticity of MS. Experiments conducted by P.
        Consroe, <i>et al</i>., demonstrated a dose-related improvement
        of idiopathic dystonias by treatment with CBD. Other researchers
        have found THC to be useful in the treatment of MD. <b>(37-40)</b>
      </p>
      <p>While testing THC for possible immunosuppressive effects,
        Lyman, <i>et al</i>., found that guinea pigs treated with THC
        developed few or no symptoms of experimental autoimmune
        encephalitis (EAE), which is used as a laboratory model of MS.
        98% of untreated animals died, while 95% of the animals treated
        with THC survived and had much less inflammation of their brain
        tissue. <b>(41, 42)</b> </p>
      <p>The 11-hydroxy metabolites of THC have been reported to be more
        effective against convulsions than the parent molecule. CBD also
        possesses anticonvulsant properties without producing behavioral
        impairment or tolerance, and it works where other drugs are
        refractory, or in combination with them. The CBD nucleus has
        been recommended as a template for the development of other
        anti-epileptic drugs. <b>(43, 44)</b> </p>
      <p>In 1998, Gilson and Busalacchi reported a new medical use of
        cannabis, i.e., for the treatment of intractable hiccups. In
        their letter to <i>Lancet</i> (351: 267) the authors concluded:
      </p>
      <p>"Because intractable hiccups is an uncommon condition, it is
        unlikely that the use of marijuana will ever be tested in a
        controlled clinical trial, and blinding would be difficult.
        Despite federal policy which forbids the use of marijuana
        therapeutically, this report should be considered for hiccups
        refractory to other measures.<b>"</b> </p>

        growth from 25% to 82% and increased the life expectancy of
        cancerous mice to the same extent. The anti-tumor activity of
        THC and CBN is very selective; it reduces tumor cells without

        days with delta-8-THC and CBN had reduced primary tumor size." </p>

        side-effects (dizziness, dissociation, etc.), which usually can
        be minimized by lying down and being reassured that there is no

        mentally ill found that patients who used marijuana enjoyed
        greater relief from their symptoms (anxiety, depression,
        insomnia) and suffered fewer hospitalizations. Most patients who
        used alcohol reported that it worsened their problems. </p>

        <b><i>Inflammation </i></b>--- The soothing effect of hemp on
        inflammatory disorders has been known for centuries. In modern
        times, cannabis has received recognition from physicians after
        some patients began reporting that smoking marijuana gave them
        relief from conditions such as pruritis and atopic dermatitis,
        an allergic reaction distinguished by severe itching and patches
        of inflamed skin. The problem can become life-threatening and
        disfiguring when it is complicated by infection. Conventional
        treatments have only limited effect. </p>
      <p>R. Turner, <i>et al</i>., have shown that THC has an
        anti-histamine effect. Mishra and Sahai found that an alcoholic
        extract of cannabis potentiates the anti-pyretic action of
        aspirin. D. Kosersky, <i>et al</i>., showed that oral
        administration of THC is 20 times more powerful that aspirin and
        twice as potent as hydrocortisone in its power to inhibit edema.
        CBD was found to produce over 90% inhibition of erythema at a
        dose of only 100 micrograms, whereas THC produced only 10%
        inhibition.&nbsp; <b>(63-66)</b> </p>
      <p>Another treatment of burns, bedsores, and other skin
        afflictions is described by B. Carty, <i>et al</i>., in US
        Patent 4,917,889, comprising an aqueous mixture of calcium
        hydroxide and hempseed oil. <b>(67)</b> </p>

        <b><i>Analgesia </i></b>--- From ancient times to date,
        cannabis preparations have been used to relieve pain. Several
        modern studies have shown analgesic effects of cannabis and its
        derivatives and analogues in animals, but the human model gives
        conflicting results. S. Miletin, <i>et al</i>., found that
        cannabis smokers have increased tolerance to experimental pain.
        To the contrary, Hill, <i>et al</i>., failed to detect
        analgesic action with another type of experimental pain. A study
        of cancer patients by R. Noyes,<i> et al</i>., found THC to be
        effective in reducing pain, while W. Regelson, <i>et al</i>.,
        reportedly found no significant analgesia. The variable and
        non-specific analgesic effects of THC are accompanied by mental
        obfuscation, so it is unlikely to become clinically useful for
        this purpose. Research continues with synthetic analogues of
        THC. Fairbairn and Pickens showed that an ethanol extract of
        cannabis will potentiate the effects of pethidine and other
        analgesics. J. Barrett, <i>et al</i>., subsequently isolated
        two new flavenoids, called Canflavons, which exhibit potent
        analgesia due to their peripheral activity. <b>(68-72)</b> </p>
      <p>More recent animal studies by several researchers (Univ.
        California SF., Univ. Michigan, Brown Univ., Univ. Minnesota)
        have shown that cannabinoids are effective analgesics which are
        not addictive, nor do they develop any tolerance. The
        cannabinoids alleviate several types of pain, particularly that
        of arthritis. Kennth Hargreaves (Univ. Texas) reported that
        injection of a THC-analog at an arthritic site&nbsp; relieves
        associated inflammation: </p>
      <p>Local administration of the cannabinoid to the site of injury
        may be able to both prevent pain from occurring and reduce pain
        which has already occurred without producing side effects. </p>

        <b><i>Anesthesia </i></b>--- THC and CBN prolong ether
        anesthesia, while CBD reverses the effect. When administered in
        combination with THC and CBN, CBD reverses the effect of CBN,
        but not of THC. <b>(73, 74)</b> </p>

        <b><i>Alcoholism </i></b>--- Several women's temperance
        societies in the 1890s recommended the recreational use of
        hashish rather than alcohol, because liquor obviously led to
        wife-beating, while hashish did not. In fact, it was considered
        to be an aphrodisiac, and experts recommended it for the
        purpose. </p>
      <p>In 1891, Dr. J.B. Mattison recommended cannabis as "the best"
        treatment for delirium tremens. In 1953, Drs. Lloyd Thompson and
        Richard Proctor tested the synthetic cannabinoid Pyrahexyl in
        the treatment of alcohol withdrawal and obtained positive
        results: </p>
      <p>We can report clinical alleviation of the symptoms in 59, or
        84.28%. The 11 cases that did not show improvement (or 15.72%)
        did not differ a great deal clinically from the other 59...
        Perhaps an individual idiosyncrasy is the explanation, for it is
        known that individual reactions to other drugs do occur." <b>(75)</b>
      </p>
      <p>In 1971, J. Scher proposed the use of cannabis as a substitute
        for alcohol in treatment of withdrawal and in delerium tremens.
        Rosenburg found no useful effect from cannabis alone. However,
        experiments conducted with marijuana as a reinforcer of
        disulfiram in the treatment of alcoholics did give positive
        results. <b>(76-78)</b> </p>
      <p>During the rapid rise in popularity of marijuana among students
        in the 1960s, Dr. Halleck (Univ. Of&nbsp; Wisconsin) commented
        in the <i>New York Times</i>: </p>
      <p>"Perhaps the one major positive effect of the drug is to cut
        down on the use of alcohol. In the last few years it is rare for
        our student infirmary to encounter a student who has become
        aggressive, disoriented, or physically ill because of excessive
        use of alcohol. Alcoholism has almost ceased to be a problem on
        our campuses. Many cannabists consider alcohol to be a debasing
        and degrading drug which they decline to use if marijuana is
        available." </p>
      <p><b>2n.</b> <br>
        <a name="hhl2n"></a><b><i>Opiate Addiction </i></b>--- In some
        cases, cannabis can serve to alleviate the symptoms of opiate
        withdrawal. As early as 1885, Dr. E. Birch reported the
        successful treatment of an opium addict and a chloral-hydrate
        addict by cannabis substitution and slow withdrawal. In 1891,
        Dr. J.B. Mattison held forth that "It has proved an efficient
        substitute for the poppy", and he described the case of "a naval
        surgeon, nine years a ten grains daily morphia taker... [who]
        recovered with less than a dozen doses. He recommended cannabis
        accordingly: </p>
      <p>"[Cannabis is] a drug that has a special value in some morbid
        conditions, and the intrinsic merit and safety of which entitles
        it to a place it once held in therapeutics... Indian hemp is not
        here intended as a specific. It will, at times, fail. So do
        other drugs. But the many cases in which it acts well, entitle
        it to a large and lasting confidence." <b>(79-81)</b> </p>
      <p>In a study of 49 cases of opiate withdrawal, conducted in 1942
        by Drs. S. Allentuck and K. Bowman, cannabis was substituted for
        opium: </p>
      <p>"The withdrawal symptoms were ameliorated or eliminated sooner,
        the patient was in a better frame of mind, his spirits were
        elevated, his physical condition was more rapidly rehabilitated,
        and he expressed a wish to resume his occupation sooner." <b>(82)</b>
      </p>
      <p>Prof. Sandra Welch (Virginia Commonwealth Univ.) found that THC
        has a pronounced potentiating effect on morphine. At a low dose,
        THC increases the analgesic effect of morphine by 500%. At
        double the dose of THC, the effect is 10 times greater. The
        effect is not additive, and is relatively safe: </p>
      <p>"One major advantage to a marijuana-morphine combination would
        be to reduce both the morphine component and a major morphine
        side-effect, depression of the respiratory system. It has
        already been confirmed that marijuana has no effect on the
        medulla, the center of the brain that controls respiration." <b>(164)</b>
      </p>
      <p>This singular finding may lead to new methods of treating
        opiate addiction. </p>

        <a name="hhl2o"></a><b><i>Diuretic</i></b> --- H. Shirkey and J.
        Rodger reported a diuretic effect of cannabis roots; R. Sofia, <i>et

        the drug. <b>(83-85</b>) </p>
      <p><b>2p.</b> <br>
        <a name="hhl2p"></a><b><i>Insomnia</i></b> --- In 1890, the
        British physician J. Reynolds highly recommended cannabis indica
        for patients with "senile insomnia". The treatment remained
        effective for years without producing tolerance: </p>
      <p>"In this class of cases I have found nothing comparable in
        utility to a moderate dose of Indian hemp." </p>
      <p>CBD induces sleep in insomniacs, with fewer dreams and no side
        effects. Other conventional hypnotics produce undesirable
        consequences such as tolerance and addiction. Marijuana
        decreases slow-wave sleep but does not affect REM sleep. <b>(86)</b>

        <a name="hhl2q"></a><b><i>Herpes</i></b> --- P. Morhan, <i>et

        simplex virus. G. Lancz, <i>et al</i>., on the other hand, have
        shown that THC binds to the herpes virus and thus inactivates
        it. Topical application of an isopropyl alcohol extract of
        Cannabis has been used to provide symptomatic relief of herpes
        sores. It prevents blisters and makes sores disappear within a
        day. Cannabis also provided symptomatic relief from gonorrhea
        and syphilis. <b>(87, 88)</b> </p>
      <p><b>2r.</b> <br>
        <a name="hhl2r"></a><b><i>Migraine</i></b> --- In 1887, H. Hare
        gave medical testimony to the value of hemp in subduing and
        preventing attacks of migraine. In 1890, Dr. J. Reynolds stated:
      </p>
      <p>"Very many victims of this malady have for years kept their
        suffering in abeyance by taking hemp at the moment of
        threatening, or onset of the attack." </p>
      <p>In 1891, Dr. J.B. Mattison asserted that, of all the
        applications of cannabis, "Its most important use is in that
        opprobrium of the healing arts --- migraine." He concluded that
        the drug not only stopped migraine headaches, but also prevented
        the attacks. In <i>The Principles and Practice of Medicine</i>
        (1913), Dr. William Osler affirmed that "Cannabis is probably
        the most satisfactory remedy" for migraines. This fact is widely
        known amongst victims of migraine, but it has not been
        sufficiently explored by modern science. Z. Volfe, <i>et al</i>.,


        reported that THC inhibits the release of serotonin from blood
        plasma platelets during migraine attacks, but the significance
        of the finding is unknown. <b>(89-93)</b> </p>

        <b><i>Ulcers</i></b> --- Stomach acid output decreases after the
        consumption of cannabis. This fact recommends it for the
        treatment of peptic ulcers, colitis, ileitis, spastic colon, and
        gastritis. Preparations of cannabis were used for that purpose
        in the 1890s. <b>(94, 95)</b> </p>
      <p><a name="hhl2t"></a><b>2t.</b> <br>
        <b><i>Gynecology</i></b> --- Cannabis has been used in the
        treatment of hyperemesis gravidum, a rare form of morning
        sickness in which the patient suffers from constant nausea and
        vomiting. When smoked or eaten during parturition, cannabis
        reduces pain and increases uterine contractions more quickly
        than ergot alkaloids. Native women in South Africa stupefy
        themselves with <i>dagga</i> to facilitate delivery. However, a
        heavily drugged baby might have a slow heartbeat and impaired
        ability to clear mucus from air passages. Dr. J. Grigor
        rediscovered the oxytocic properties of Indian hemp in 1852, and
        stated: </p>
      <p>"It is capable of bringing the labor to a happy conclusion
        considerably within half the time that would otherwise have been
        required, thus saving protracted suffering to the patient, and
        the time of the practitioner." </p>
      <p>Cannabis also has been used to treat mastitis, dysmenorrhea,
        and post-partum pain, and to increase lactation. <b>(96, 97)</b>
      </p>
      <p>In 1883, Dr. John Brown recommended the use of cannabis in
        uterine dysfunctions, especially menorrhagia (excessive uterine
        bleeding): </p>
      <p>"There is no medicine which has given such good results; for
        this reason it ought to take the first place as a remedy in
        menorrhagia... The failures are so few, that I venture to call
        it a specific in menorrhagia." </p>
      <p>His contemporary colleague Dr. Robert Batho agreed: </p>
      <p>"Considerable experience of its employment in menorrhagia has
        convinced me that it is... one of the most reliable means at our
        disposal... [Cannabis is] par excellence the remedy for that
        condition... It is so certain in its&nbsp; power of controlling
        menorrhagea, that it is a valuable aid to diagnosis in cases
        where it is uncertain whether an early abortion may or may not
        have occurred..." <b>(97)</b> </p>

        <b>Anti-Oxidant ---</b>Experiments conducted at the National
        Institute of Health (Bethesda MD) in 1998 showed Cannabidiol to
        be a potent anti-oxidant, even more effective than Vitamins C or
        E. The researchers induced ischemic strokes in rats, then
        treated them with CBD to neutralize free radicals which cause
        much of the damage associated with such strokes. The Israeli
        company Pharmos is conducting human clinical trials with the
        synthetic cannabinoid Dexnibinol to treat damage from strokes.
        CBD potentially offers an optional treatment (and possible
        prevention) of stroke, heart attacks, and neurodegenerative

        <b>Hempseed &amp; Nutrition</b> </p>
      <p>Legend says that Gautama Buddha ate only one hemp seed a day
        for six years while he waited for nirvana.<b> </b>Hempseed is
        eaten by many of India's poor people. A mixture called <i>bosa</i>
        consists of the seeds of Eleusine and hemp, and <i>mura</i> is
        made with parched wheat, amaranth or rice, and hempseed. The
        seeds are said to make all vegetables more palatable and
        complete foods. Sometimes it is an ingredient in chutney. <i>Bhang</i>
        and ripe hempseed also is used to flavor or strengthen the
        formulations of some alcohol beverages. </p>
      <p>Hempseed has served as a primary famine food in China,
        Australia, and Europe as recently as World War Two. Medieval
        Christian monks ate hempseed gruel every day. Even in modern
        times, mothers of the Sotho tribe in South Africa are known to
        feed their babies with ground hempseed in pap. <b>(99)</b> </p>
      <p>Hempseed now is an ingredient in food products, including
        flour, cheese, ice cream, yogurt, pudding, milk, spreads, candy,
        and meat substitutes. Prices are kept high by the cost of
        shipping, steam sterilization, repackaging, domestic shipping,
        and old equipment. </p>
      <p>Hempseed contains all the essential amino acids and fatty
        acids, and is considered to be a complete food. The seed or
        achene contains 26-31% crude protein, 65% of which is globular
        edestin and albumin that is about 84% digestible. Lysine (the
        limiting protein in edestin) and other components are destroyed
        by the heat generated when hempseed is pressed for its oil.
        Addition of 1% lysine hydrochloride will restore the nutritional
        balance of heat-treated edestin. The meal also contains about 6%
        carbohydrates, 5-10% fat, 12% crude fiber, 10% moisture, and 7%
        ash. <b>(100, 101)</b> </p>
      <p>T.B. Osborne studied hemp edestin and reported on its isolation
        and purification in 1892. Until the passage of the infamous
        Marihuana Tax Act in 1937, edestin was regarded as a standard
        example of the seed globulins (the third most abundant protein
        after collagen and albumin). They are vital to the maintenance
        of a healthy immune system.<b> (102, 103)</b> </p>
      <p>The globulin edestin in hempseed closely resembles that found
        in human blood plasma, and it is easily digested, absorbed, and
        utilized. Hemp edestin is so completely compatible with the
        human digestive system, that the Czechoslovakian Tubercular
        Nutrition Study (1955) found hempseed to be the only food that
        can successfully treat the consumptive disease tuberculosis, in
        which the nutritive processes are impaired. <b>(104)</b> </p>
      <p>When hempseed is fed to poultry on a regular basis, the birds
        do not go "off feed", and they do not require hormones to fatten
        them. Egg production also is increased. Hempseed meal has an
        effect analogous to that of grit in chicken diets in as much as
        the gizzard linings are found to be free of corrugations and
        erosions. <b>(105-107)</b> </p>
      <p>In <i>Systema Agriculturae</i> (1675), John Worlidge
        commented: </p>
      <p>"Hemp seed is much commended for the feeding of poultry and
        other fowl, so that where plenty thereof may be had, and a good
        return for fowl, the use thereof must needs be advantageous..."

        <b>Hempseed Oil</b> </p>
      <p>Hempseed oil is used in paints, varnishes, inks and lubricants.
        When exposed to air, the fatty acids in hempseed oil form a hard
        film which makes it very useful in the manufacture of paints.
        The cellulose and other organic chemicals in cannabis can serve
        as feedstock for the manufacture of plastics and other synthetic
        substances. The oil has excellent surfactant properties which
        are put to use in several new hygiene products such as soap,
        shampoo, cosmetics and balms. For example, the SATIVA Gmbh
        (Germany) manufactures a detergent from hempseed oil and
        ruptured yeast; it removes stains with high efficiency, due to
        its very low surface tension. The detergent is used as an
        industrial cleaner for engines, and to clean
        petroleum-contaminated soil. It is completely bio-compatible and
        uses no phosphates, enzymes, or bleaches. </p>
      <p>30-35% of the weight of hempseed is oil containing 80% of the
        unsaturated essential fatty acids (EFA), Linoleic Acid (LA, 55%)
        and Linolenic Acid (LNA, 21-25%). These are not manufactured by
        the body and must be supplied by food. The oil also contains
        about 8% by volume of palmitic, stearic, oleic and arachidic
        acids. The 80% EFAs in hempseed oil is the highest total
        percentage amongst the common plants used by man. Flax oil ranks
        second with 72% EFAs. The EFAs are very sensitive to heat, light
        and oxygen. For this reason, hempseed oil must be processed and
        stored carefully (in the cold, dark, and under vacuum) to
        preserve the potency of the EFAs. The fatty acid composition (%
        of total oil) of hempseed oil is: 18:3w3 (20%), 18:2w6 (60%),
        18:1w9 (12%), 18:0 (2%), and 16:0 (6%). </p>
      <p>EFAs are precursors to the prostaglandin series (PGE 1,2, &amp;
        3). PGE 1 inhibits the production of cholesterol and dilates
        blood vessels, and it prevents the clotting of blood platelets
        in arteries. A. Kemmoku, <i>et al</i>., found that a diet of
        hempseed causes the serum levels of total cholesterol to drop
        dramatically. Blood pressure also decreases after several weeks
        of eating hempseed, due to the steady, adequate supply of EFAs.<b>
          (108-110)</b> </p>
      <p>U. Erasmus, author of <i>Fats that Heal, Fats that Kill</i>,
        states that the proportions of Linoleic Acid (LA) and Linolenic
        Acid (LNA) in hempseed oil are perfectly balanced to meet human
        requirements for EFAs, including gamma-linoleic acid (GLA).
        Unlike flax oil and others, hempseed oil can be used
        continuously without developing a deficiency or other imbalance
        of EFAs. The peroxide value (PV, the degree of rancidity) of
        hempseed oil is only 0.1-0.5, which is very low and safe and
        does not spoil its taste. In comparison, the PV of virgin olive
        oil is about 20, and the PV of corn oil is about 40-60. <b>(111-116)</b>
      </p>
      <p>A study conducted by Struempler and Nelson (Univ. of Utah) in
        1997 indicates that legal hempseed oil contains enough
        cannabinoids to produce a positive result with standard urine
        drug test procedures. Samples continued to test positive for two
        days after the subject stopped ingesting hempseed oil. This
        effect has caused consternation in the drug-testing industry,
        and has led to lawsuits. The drug-testing industry is lobbying
        to ban hempseed oil.&nbsp; <b>(116)</b> </p>

      <p>The public health effects of cannabis consumption have been
        examined repeatedly by official panels, beginning with the
        Indian Hemp Drugs Commission in 1893. None of the studies have
        found reason to proscribe cannabis, and several have recommended
        that it be legalized. </p>

        <a name="hhl5a"></a><b><i>The Indian Hemp Drugs Commission</i></b>
        (1893-94) --- In the 1870s, it was common practice for
        government officials in India to blame ganja as a cause of
        insanity and crime, since users of ganja were poor, helpless,
        and convenient scapegoats. In 1871, the Indian Secretary of
        State directed all local administrators to inquire into the
        ganja problem. After reviewing the correspondence it received,
        the government duly announced that there was no proof that hemp
        drugs caused criminal behavior any more than any other drugs,
        such as opium or cocaine. The government also stated: </p>
      <p>"There is no doubt that its habitual use does tend to produce
        insanity, the total number of cases of insanity is small in
        proportion to the population, and not large enough [to be of
        concern] even in proportion to the number of ganja smokers..." </p>
      <p>Local officials were not convinced and continued to complain.
        Another commission was appointed in 1877 to study the issue. It
        was determined that the only way to reduce consumption was to
        make "the tax on this article as high as it can possibly bear":
      </p>
      <p>"The policy of Government must be to limit its production and
        sale by a high rate of duty without placing the drug entirely
        beyond the reach of those who will insist upon having it." </p>
      <p>Eventually the English bureaucrats also began to complain,
        until The Indian Hemp Drug Commission was established to study
        the issue. The commissioners did an excellent job, questioning
        the morality of hemp use, the possibility of controlling its
        cultivation, the grade of cannabis used (bhang, charas, or
        ganja), and the problem of admixtures of opium, datura, etc.. </p>
      <p>The Commission also studied the extent of use of hemp as a
        drug, its social and religious usage, its physical and
        psychological effects, and its relation to insanity and crime.
        When the Commission investigated the "very sketchy" records of
        insane asylums, they found that cannabis had been scapegoated: </p>
      <p>"It is a common practice to enter hemp drugs as the cause of
        insanity where it has been shown that the patient used these
        drugs," and to change the reported "cause of insanity" from
        "unknown" to "ganja smoking"... </p>
      <p>"It must be borne in mind that it is impossible to say that the
        use of hemp drugs was in all [61 of 222] cases the sole cause of
        insanity, or indeed any part of the cause... Taking these
        accepted cases as a whole, we have a number of instances where
        the hemp drug habit has been so established in relation to
        insanity that, admitting (as we must admit) that hemp drugs as
        intoxicants cause more or less of cerebral stimulation, it may
        be accepted as reasonably proved, in the absence of evidence of
        other causes, that hemp drugs do cause insanity... </p>
      <p>"Summary of conclusions regarding effects... It has been
        clearly established that the occasional use of hemp in moderate
        doses may be beneficial; but this use may be regarded as
        medicinal in character. It is rather to the popular and common
        use of the drugs that the Commission will now confine their
        attention... </p>
      <p>"In regard to the physical effects, the Commission have come to
        the conclusion that the moderate use of hemp drugs is
        practically attended by no evil results at all... The moderate
        use of hemp drug appears to cause no appreciable physical injury
        of any kind... As in the case of other intoxicants, excessive
        use tends to weaken the constitution and to render the consumer
        more susceptible to disease... It is but rarely that excessive
        indulgence in hemp drugs can be credited with inciting to crime
        or leading to homicidal frenzy... </p>
      <p>"Total prohibition of the cultivation of the hemp plant for
        narcotics... is neither necessary nor expedient in consideration
        of their ascertained effects... When subjected to careful
        examination, the grounds on which the allegations [against hemp]
        are founded prove to be in the highest degree defective."<b>

        <a name="hhl5b"></a><b><i>The Canal Zone Studies</i></b> --- The
        Republic of Panama prohibited the "cultivation, use and
        consumption of the herb Kan-Jac" (cannabis) in 1923. At the same
        time, reports of American soldiers smoking the drug prompted the
        provost marshal to prohibit its possession by military personnel
        in the Canal Zone. A formal committee was convened in April 1925
        to investigate the issue. Col. J.F. Siler (chairman of the
        committee), <i>et al</i>., observed some soldiers, four
        doctors, and two police officers smoking marijuana without ill
        effect. Lt. Col. Chamberlain declared: </p>
      <p>"I think we can safely say, based upon samples we have smoked
        here and upon the reports of individuals concerned, that there
        is nothing to indicate any habit forming tendency or any
        striking ill effects. All of the statements to the effect that
        two or three puffs produce remarkable effects are nonsense,
        judging from our experience." </p>
      <p>In its report to the governor, the committee recommended: </p>
      <p>"No steps [should] be taken by the Canal Zone authorities to
        prevent the sale or use of marihuana... There is no evidence
        that marihuana, as grown and used is a 'habit-forming' drug in
        the sense in which the term is applied to alcohol, opium,
        cocaine, etc., or that it has any appreciable deleterious
        influence on the individuals using it... The influence of the
        drug when used for smoking... apparently has been greatly
        exaggerated. Most of the reports appear to have little basis in
        fact. There is no medical evidence that it causes insanity...
        The British [Indian Hemp Drugs Commission] which investigated
        the effects of Cannabis sativa... came to the conclusion that...
        most of the effects attributed to it were due to other
        substances (opium, datura, stramonium, cantharides, etc.) added
        to the preparations which were used...." </p>
      <p>Repeated investigations in 1929 and 1931 produced the same
        results. Col. Siler's summary of the Canal Zone investigations
        was published in <i>Military Surgeon</i> (November 1933): </p>
      <p>"The Committee reached the following conclusions: </p>
      <p>"There is no evidence that marijuana&nbsp; as grown here is a
        'habit-forming' drug in the sense in which the term is applied
        to alcohol, opium, cocaine, etc., or that it has any appreciable
        deleterious influence on the individual using it... </p>
      <p>"Delinquencies due to marijuana smoking... are negligible in
        number when compared with delinquencies resulting from the use
        of alcoholic drinks which also may be classed as stimulants and
        intoxicants. <b>" (120, 121)</b> </p>
      <p>Years later during the Vietnam War, the drug problem certainly
        did exist for the military, and it was severely complicated by
        the easy availability of opiates and by the CIA's trafficking of
        heroin. It was estimated that about 60% of the US soldiers in
        Vietnam used marijuana to make their situation tolerable. </p>

        <b><i>The LaGuardia Committee Report</i></b> --- In 1938, while
        Frank H. LaGuardia was mayor of New York, he requested that the
        N. Y. Academy of Medicine appoint a special subcommittee "to
        make a survey of existing knowledge on this subject [marijuana]
        and carry out any observation required to determine the
        pertinent facts regarding this form of drug addiction and the
        necessity for its control." In 1944, Mayor LaGuardia's Committee
        on Marihuana published its report, <i>The Marihuana Problem in
          the City of New York</i>. The study was comprised of
        sociological, clinical, and pharmacological studies. The
        clinical study considered medical aspects (symptoms, behavior,
        and organic and systemic functions, addiction, tolerance, and
        possible therapeutic applications), psychological and
        intellectual functioning, emotional reactions, general
        personality structure, and family and community ideologies. </p>
      <p>In its final report, the Committee drew the following
        conclusions (among others): </p>
      <p>"The practice of smoking marijuana does not lead to addiction
        in the medical sense of the word... The use of marihuana does
        not lead to morphine or heroin or cocaine addiction and no
        effort is made to create a market for these narcotics by
        stimulating the practice of marihuana smoking. Marihuana is not
        the determining factor in the commission of major crimes...
        Juvenile delinquency is not associated with the practice of
        smoking of marihuana. The publicity concerning the catastrophic
        effects of marihuana smoking in New York City is unfounded... </p>
      <p><b>"</b>Indulgence in marihuana does not appear to result in
        mental deterioration... Under the influence of marihuana the
        basic personality structure of the individual does not change,
        but some of the more superficial aspects of his behavior show
        alteration... [A comparison between users and non-users]
        accustomed to daily smoking for a period of from two and a half
        to sixteen years, showed no abnormal system functioning which
        would&nbsp; differentiate them from the non-users. There is
        definite evidence in this study that marihuana smokers were not
        inferior in intelligence to the general population and that they
        suffered no mental or physical deterioration as a result of
        their use of the drug." </p>
      <p>When subjects were tested for their family values and
        ideologies while under the influence of marihuana, it was found:
      </p>
      <p>"The only very definite change as a result of the ingestion of
        marihuana was in their attitude toward the drug itself. Without
        marihuana only 4 out of 14 subjects said they would tolerate the
        sale of marihuana while after ingestion 8 of them were in favor
        of this." <b>(122)</b> </p>

        <b><i>The Wooton Report ---</i></b> The British Advisory
        Committee on Drug Dependence appointed the Hallucinogens
        Sub-Committee, chaired by Baroness Barbara Wooton of Abinger, to
        review the literary evidence about cannabis. The <i>Wooton
          Report on Cannabis</i>, issued in 1968, confirmed earlier
        studies: </p>
      <p>"Having reviewed all the material available to us we find
        ourselves in agreement with the conclusion reached by the Indian
        Hemp Drugs Commission appointed by the Government of India
        (1893-1894) and the New York Mayor's Committee on Marihuana
        (1944) that the long-term consumption of cannabis in moderate
        doses has no harmful effects." <b>(123, 124)</b> </p>

        <b><i>The Shafer Commission</i></b> --- The Comprehensive Drug
        Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970 also established the
        national Commission on Marijuana and Drug Abuse, chaired by
        former Pennsylvania Governor Raymond Shafer. In summary, the
        commission concluded: </p>
      <p>"WHO USES THE DRUG? At least 24 million Americans over the age
        of 12 have used marihuana at least once, and at least 8.3
        million are current users. Two percent (500,000) of the
        'ever-users' can be classified as heavy users and use the drug
        more than once a day. </p>
      <p>"EFFECTS OF MARIHUANA ON THE INDIVIDUAL: There is no evidence
        that experimental or intermittent use of marihuana causes
        physical or psychological harm... </p>
      <p>"The immediate effects of marihuana intoxication on the
        individual's organs or bodily functions are transient and have
        little or no permanent effect. However, there is a definite loss
        of some psychomotor control and a temporary impairment of time
        and space perception. </p>
      <p>"No brain damage has been documented relating to marihuana use.
      </p>
      <p>"There is no reported case of a single human fatality in the
        United States proven to have resulted solely from the use of
        marihuana. </p>
      <p>"No reliable evidence exists to indicate that marihuana causes
        genetic defects in man. </p>
      <p>"Psychosis resulting from marihuana use is extremely rare and
        such reactions tend to occur in predisposed individuals. </p>
      <p>"MARIHUANA &amp; PUBLIC SAFETY: The evidence indicates that
        marihuana does not cause violent or aggressive behavior or
        crime. </p>
      <p>"Recent research has not proven that marihuana use
        significantly impairs driving ability... </p>
      <p>"MARIHUANA &amp; THE PUBLIC HEALTH &amp; WELFARE: The present
        level of marihuana use in American society does not constitute a
        threat to the public health. </p>
      <p>"Although some segments of society fear that marihuana use
        leads to idleness and "dropping out", little likelihood exists
        that the introduction of a single element such as marihuana
        would significantly change the basic personality of any person;
        rather, an individual is more likely to "drop out" when
        circumstances join to produce psychological pressures which he
        cannot handle effectively. </p>
      <p>"Except for some individuals for whom drug-taking, perhaps
        including marihuana use, has become a central figure of their
        lifestyles, the marihuana user is not "sick" or in need of
        "treatment". </p>
      <p>"MARIHUANA &amp; OTHER DRUGS: The overwhelming majority of
        marihuana users do not progress to drugs other than alcohol,
        although statistically marihuana users are more likely to
        experiment with other drugs than non-users. In general, a person
        willing to experiment with one drug is more likely to experiment
        with another drug than a person not predisposed to experiment to
        begin with... </p>
      <p>"The weakest link between marihuana use and use of other drugs
        is between marihuana and heroin; about 4% of those who have
        tried marihuana have also tried heroin." </p>
      <p>In its summary, the Commission noted: </p>
      <p>"Once existing policy was cast into the realm of public debate,
        partisans on both sides of the issue over-simplified the
        question of the effects of the drug on the individual.
        Proponents of the prohibitory legal system contended that
        marihuana was a dangerous drug, while opponents insisted that it
        was a harmless drug or was less harmful than alcohol or tobacco.
      </p>
      <p>"Any psychoactive drug is potentially harmful to the
        individual, depending on the intensity, frequency, and duration
        of use. Marihuana is no exception. Because the particular
        hazards of use differ for different drugs, it makes no sense to
        compare the harmfulness of different drugs. One may compare the
        harmfulness of different drugs. One may compare, insofar as the
        individual is concerned, only the harmfulness of specific
        effects. Is heroin less harmful than alcohol because, unlike
        alcohol, it directly causes no physical injury? Or is heroin
        more harmful than alcohol because at normal doses its use is
        more incapacitating in a behavioral sense? </p>
      <p>"Assessment of the relative dangers of particular drugs is
        meaningful only in a wider context which weighs the possible
        benefits of the drugs, the comparative scope of their use, and
        their relative impact on society at large... </p>
      <p>"Looking only at the effects on the individual, there is little
        proven danger of physical or psychological harm from
        experimental or intermittent use of the natural preparations of
        cannabis, including the resinous mixtures commonly used in this
        country. The risk of harm lies instead in the heavy, long-term
        use of the drug, particularly of the most potent preparations. </p>
      <p>"The experimenter and the intermittent users develop little or
        no psychological dependence on the drug. No <br>
        organ injury is demonstrable... </p>
      <p>"Total prohibition is functionally inappropriate. Apart from
        the philosophical and constitutional constraints... a total
        prohibition scheme carries with it significant institutional
        costs. yet it constributes very little to the achievement of our
        social policy. In some ways it actually inhibits the success of
        that policy. </p>
      <p>"The primary goals of a prudent marihuana social control policy
        include preventing irresponsible use of the drug, attending to
        the consequences of such use, and deemphasizing use in general.
        Yet an absolute prohibition of possession and use inhibits the
        ability of other institutions to contribute actively to these
        objectives. For example... the illegality of possession and use
        creates difficulties in achieving an open, honest educational
        program, both in the schools and in the home." <b>(125)</b> </p>
      <p>The Commission recommended changes in the Federal law, thus: </p>
      <p>"Possession of marihuana for personal use would no longer be an
        offense, but marihuana possessed in public would remain
        contraband subject to summary seizure and forfeiture. Casual
        distribution of small amounts of marihuana for no renumeration,
        or insignificant renumeration not involving profit would no
        longer be an offense." </p>
      <p>Instead of heeding the sage advise of the Shafer Commission,
        President Nixon declared "war on drugs" in a message to Congress
        on June 17, 1971, and we now suffer accordingly. </p>
      <p><b>5f.</b> <br>
        <a name="hhl5f"></a><b><i>The Jamaica Study</i></b> --- In 1970,
        the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) Center for
        Studies of Narcotic and Drug Abuse sponsored the Jamaica Study,
        "the first project in medical anthropology to be undertaken
        and... the first intensive, multi-disciplinary study of
        marijuana use and users to be published."<b> (126-129)</b> </p>
      <p>The Jamaica project staff studied the legislation,
        ethnohistory, and social complex of ganja, and the acute effects
        of smoking in a natural setting. Clinical studies were
        conducted, and examinations made of respiratory function and
        hematology, electroencephalography, and psychiatric evaluations
        and psychological assessments ere made of the 70 subjects. The
        complex ganja culture from which the subjects were drawn
        pervades and greatly influences the working-class community. In
        some communities, 50% of the males over 15 smoked ganja
        regularly, and only 20% were non-smokers. </p>
      <p>In his forewords to Vera Rubin and L. Comitas' <i>Ganja in
          Jamaica</i> (1975), Raymond Shafer (Chairman of the Shafer
        Commission, v.i.) stated: </p>
      <p>"While Americans are concerned with the alleged 'amotivational'
        and drug escalation effects of marihuana, ganja in Jamaica
        serves to fulfill values of the work ethic; for example, the
        primary use of ganja by working class males is as an energizer.
        Furthermore, there is no problem of drug escalation in the
        Jamaican working class; as a multipurpose plant, ganja is used
        medicinally, even by non-smokers, and is taken in teas by women
        and children for prophylactic and therapeutic purposes. For such
        users, there is no reliance even on potent medicines,
        amphetamines or barbiturates, let alone heroin and LSD. Further,
        the use of ganja appears to be a "benevolent alternative" to
        heavy consumption of alcohol by the working class. Admissions to
        the mental hospital in Jamaica for alcoholism accounts for less
        than 1% annually, in contrast to other Caribbean areas where
        ganja use is not pervasive and admission rates for alcoholism
        are as high as 55%. </p>
      <p>"This study indicates that there is little correlation between
        use of ganja and crime, except insofar as the possession and
        cultivation of ganja are technically crimes. There were no
        indications of organic brain damage or chromosome damage among
        the subjects and no significant clinical (psychiatric,
        psychological or medical) differences between the smokers and
        controls. The single medical finding of interest, and this is a
        trend, is the indication of functional hypoxia among heavy,
        long-term chronic users. Ganja is customarily mixed with
        tobacco, and ganja smokers are also heavy cigarette smokers...
        It was impossible to distinguish between clinical effects of
        ganja and tobacco smoking and cigarette smoking; it is,
        consequently suggested that smoking per se may be a factor in
        this finding. </p>
      <p>"Despite its illegality, ganja use is pervasive, and duration
        and frequency are very high; it is smoked over a longer period
        in greater quantities with greater THC potency than in the
        United States, without deleterious social or psychological
        consequences. The major difference is that both ganja use and
        expected behaviors are culturally conditioned and controlled by
        well-established tradition. The findings throw new light on the
        cannabis question, particularly that the relationship between
        man and marihuana is not simply pharmaceutical, and indicate the
        need for new approaches." </p>
      <p>The Jamaica Study also afforded due respect to the Rastafari
        religion, in which ganja is regarded as a sacrament and a gift
        of God: </p>
      <p>"In addition, ganja, unlike alcohol, has special symbolic
        attributes. Rastafarian metaphysics, for example, emphasizes and
        brings into focus general concepts derived from working-class
        views of ganja. For them, it is "the wisdom weed" of divine
        origin, an elixir vitae, documented by Biblical chapter and
        verse which over-rides man-made proscriptions. Religious
        authority thus validates and fortifies commitment to its use;
        there is no need to invoke religious validations of alcohol
        consumption, which is legally and socially accepted. While
        drinking in the local bar may enhance feelings of sociability,
        the sacred ganja permits a sense of religious communication,
        marked by meditation and contemplation." </p>
      <p>Melanie Dreher, an anthropologist at the University of Miami,
        was a key member of the Jamaica team. In her study, entitled <i>Working



          Men and Ganja</i>, she found that the drinking of ganja tea or
        tonic extracts is widespread, even by non-smokers and children:

        retention, recurrent malaria, impotence, vision problems,
        dermatological eruptions, pneumonia, colds, and various
        intestinal complaints. Ganja teas and tonics are particularly
        recommended for children... The preparations are administered to
        children to cure marasmus and infant diarrhea, relieve the pain
        of teething, and in general provide an all-purpose medicine for

        (NIH) cooperated in a study led by William Carter, <i>et al</i>.,


        of <i>Chronic Cannabis Use in Costa Rica</i>. 84 cannabis
        smokers and 156 controls who had never smoked ganja were
        subjected to a battery of sophisticated medical and
        psychological examinations. The results were equivalent to those
        of the Jamaica study, with few notable differences: the
        similarities outweighed the differences&nbsp; between users and
        non-users, and ganja smokers generally enjoyed longer-lasting
        relationships with their mates. The Costa Rica project also
        examined testosterone levels and immunology as affected by
        cannabis. No relation was found between cannabis use and
        testosterone levels, nor were the subjects' immune functions
        impaired. The neurophysiological functions, intelligence and
        personality of the subjects did not differ significantly from
        the matched controls. Chronic cannabis consumption did not
        impair intelligence or cause any apparent brain damage. In
        short, the Costa Rica study found no significant health
        consequences to chronic cannabis smokers. </p>
      <p>The NIH refused to accept the report for publication, demanding

        300 copies. Fortunately, a copy of the original version was

        particularly of the epidemiological characteristics of cannabis
        use and on the effects of its long-term use by humans; </p>

        Canadian government a Commission of Inquiry into the Non-Medical
        Use of Drugs in May 1969. It was popularly called the LeDain
        Commission after its chairman, Gerald LeDain (Dean of Osgoode
        Hall Law School, York University, Toronto). In its 320-page <i>Interim


          Report</i> (April 1970), the commission described the need to
        legalize the simple possession of cannabis (and other
        psychoactive drugs) in terms of the cost of prohibition: </p>
      <p>"Its enforcement would appear to cost far too much, in
        individual and social terms, for any utility which it may be
        shown to have... The present cost of its enforcement, and the
        individual and social harm caused by it, are in our opinion, one
        of the major problems involved in the non-medical use of
        drugs... Insofar as cannabis, and possibly the stronger
        hallucinogens like LSD, are concerned, the present law against
        simple possession would appear to be unenforceable, except in a
        very selective and discriminatory kind of way. This results
        necessarily from the extent of use and the kinds of individual
        involved. It is obvious that the police cannot make a serious
        attempt at full enforcement of the law against simple
        possession... </p>
      <p>"The Commission is of the opinion that no one should be liable
        for imprisonment for simple posssession of a psychotropic drug
        for non-medical purposes... </p>
      <p>"Many of the young people who have appeared before us have been
        critical of the drug education to which they have been exposed.
        In particular, they have said that the attempts to use 'scare
        tactics' have 'backfired' and destroyed the credibility of sound
        information... </p>
      <p>"The conclusion we draw from the testimony we have heard is
        that it is a grave error to indulge in deliberate distortion or
        exagerration concerning the alleged dangers of a perticular
        drug, or to base a program of drug education upon a strategy of
        fear. It is no use playing 'chicken' with young people; in nine
        cases out of ten they will accept the challenge... </p>
      <p>"1.&nbsp; The use of marijuana is increasing in popularity
        among all age groups of the population, and particularly among
        the young; </p>
      <p>"2. This increase indicates that the attempt to suppress, or
        even to control its use, is failing and will continue to fail
        --- that people are not deterred by the criminal law prohibition
        against its use; </p>
      <p>"3. The present legislative policy has not been justified by
        clear and unequivocal evidence of short term or long term harm
        caused by cannabis; </p>
      <p><b>"</b>4. The individual and social harm (including the
        destruction of young lives and growing disrespect for law)
        caused by the present use of the criminal law to suppress
        cannabis far outweighs any potential for harm which cannabis
        could conceivably possess, having regard to the long history of
        its use and the present lack of evidence; </p>
      <p>"5. The illicit status of cannabis invites exploitation by
        criminal elements, and other abuses such as adulteration; it
        also brings cannabis users into contact with such criminal
        elements and with other drugs, such&nbsp; heroin, which they
        might not otherwise be induced to consider. </p>
      <p>"For all of these reasons, it is said, cannabis should be made
        available under government-controlled conditions of quality and
        availability." </p>

        <a name="hhl6"></a><b>Physical Effects</b> </p>
      <p>Many reports written in the 1970s about the physical effects of
        THC and cannabis smoke were grossly biased for political
        purposes, no thanks to the infamous Gabriel Nahas and his
        coterie of propagandists. Their corruption of the scientific
        process severely retarded the progress of cannabis medical
        research at that time and since then.<i> </i>The Nahas scandal
        is discussed in Section 10 (Propaganda). </p>
      <p><b>6a.</b> <br>
        <a name="hhl6a"></a><b><i>Smoking</i></b> --- THC is not a
        respiratory depressant. However, heavy smoking of
        marijuana&nbsp; (several times daily) causes mild constriction
        of airways. Smoking can produce inflammation and aggravate
        existing sinusitis, pharyngitis, bronchitis, or coughing.
        Antibiotics do not provide relief, but a decrease of consumption
        does. Light smoking of marijuana has little effect on breathing,
        except for bronchodilation. Many asthmatics are thankful for
        this. Ventilatory mechanics and gas exchange remain normal,
        except for a transient stimulatory effect on oxygen consumption
        and CO<sub>2</sub> ventilation. Marijuana decreases the salivary
        flow in the maxillary gland, resulting in a dry mouth. <b>(140-142)</b>
      </p>
      <p>Alveolar macrophages, the antibacterial mechanisms of the lung,
        are slightly affected by water-soluble cytotoxins found in
        marijuana smoke, but the reported experimental results are
        conflicting and inconclusive. The heat of the smoke depresses
        the activity of the ciliated esophageal cells. There is scant
        evidence of a direct carcinogenic effect of smoke or tar. Some
        experiments with marijuana tar have produced mutations in
        several strains of bacteria, and rats which have been painted
        with the tar have developed benign skin tumors. Marijuana smoke
        has been found to contain many of the same carcinogenic
        compounds as tobacco, but to date there have been no cases of
        cancer attributed to smoking cannabis. The effect of marijuana
        seems to accelerate (rather than initiate) malignant changes.
        The traditional water-pipe (hookah or bong) serves well to
        mitigate the irritating effects of the smoke. <b>(143, 144)</b>
      </p>
      <p>Dr. Paul Donald has presented preliminary circumstantial
        evidence of 20 cases of upper aerodigestive tract malignancy
        (squamous cell carcinomas of the tongue, lips, neck, tonsils,
        etc.) in 20 young patients (average age: 26.2 years) who smoked
        marijuana. Only four of the group did not also use tobacco,
        alcohol and other drugs. A few of the cases had used cannabis
        only occasionally in high school and college. It is questionable
        if their use of marijuana was the etiological cause of the
        malignancies. Many of the same irritants in tobacco smoke are
        found in marijuana smoke, some of them (such as napthalene and
        benzopyrene) in greater amounts than in tobacco. Biopsies of
        chronic hashish smokers conducted by Tennant and others have
        shown cellular abnormalities such as proliferating basal
        epithelial cells and atypical cells, but no malignancies.<b>
          (145-148)</b> </p>
      <p>Vitamin C and cysteine have been found to reverse or protect
        hamster lung tissue cultures against the atypical growth induced
        by exposure to marijuana smoke. <b>(149)</b> </p>
      <p>The most evident and immediate effect of smoking or ingesting
        cannabis is a rapid increase in heart rate (up to 90
        beats/minute) which diminishes within an hour and poses no
        threat to a healthy individual. Blood pressure rises slightly,
        and postural hypotension can occur. Premature ventricular
        contractions have been reported. Chronic use of cannabis
        produces a consistent gain in plasma volume caused by sodium
        retention. After a few weeks, smokers develop a tolerance to the
        cardiac and psychotropic effects of THC. However, people with
        atherosclerosis or other coronary disease are at risk and should
        not compromise themselves with cannabis. In a case reported in
        1979, a 25 year old man developed an acute subendocardial
        infarction after smoking marijuana.&nbsp;<b> (150)</b> </p>
      <p><b>6b.</b> <br>
        <a name="hhl6b"></a><b><i>Hypothermia</i></b> --- THC produces
        hypothermia (lower body temperature) in animals, but experiments
        with humans have shown little or no such effect except at high
        doses. Instead, skin temperature, metabolic rate, and heart rate
        are increased, but core temperature remains unchanged. Marijuana
        also inhibits sweating. <b>(151, 152)</b> </p>
      <p><b>6c.</b> <br>
        <a name="hhl6c"></a><b><i>Chrono-Pharmacology</i></b> --- E.L.
        Abel found a chrono-pharmacological effect of THC in conjunction
        with hypothermia in mice injected with THC in DMSO, morning,
        noon and night. The greatest change in body temperature occurs
        in the afternoon, and the least change in the morning and at
        night. <b>(153)</b> </p>
      <p><b>6d.</b> <br>
        <a name="hhl6d"></a><b><i>Toxicity</i></b> --- Cannabis is
        non-toxic. No deaths from an overdose of cannabis have ever been
        verified. A few poorly documented reports have listed cannabis
        as the cause of death, but closer examination has shown the
        accusations to be untenable. <b>(154-15)</b> </p>
      <p>A few near-fatal intravenous injections of a water extract of
        marijuana have been reported. In 1970, one such foolish person
        suffered reversible anuritic acute renal failure, hypotension,
        tachycardia, transient leukopena, fever, pulmonary venous
        congestion, and an enlarged liver. <b>(157)</b> </p>
      <p>It has been estimated that it would be necessary to chain-smoke
        about 800 marijuana cigarettes to kill a human, and even then
        one would probably receive a lethal dose of carbon monoxide
        first. In comparison, only 60 mg of nicotine or 300 ml of
        alcohol can kill a person. The LD<sub>50</sub> for THC in
        animals is between 20-40 mg/kg/iv, or 800-1400 mg/kg orally
        depending on the species. <b>(158, 159)</b> </p>
      <p><b>6e.</b> <br>
        <a name="hhl6e"></a><b><i>Driving</i></b> --- Experimental
        studies of driving conducted on test courses have shown that
        performance is impaired by marijuana. Judgment, concentration,
        and car handling skills are affected, and the influence may
        persist for a full day afterward. The determination of marijuana
        intoxication requires a blood or urine sample; this has made it
        difficult to study&nbsp; role in driving violations and
        accidents. Furthermore, the detrimental effects on motor skills
        may persist for several hours after the subjective euphoria has
        passed. Comparison of several studies indicates that about 15%
        of road accidents involve marijuana. Soderstrom, <i>et al</i>.,
        found that up to 34.7% of vehicular trauma patients they
        examined were under the influence of marijuana. <b>(160)</b> </p>
      <p>In 1993, police in Memphis TN outfitted an ambulance as a "drug
        van" with a toilet, interview area, and videotaping equipment .
        They proceeded to make on-the-spot tests of the urine of any
        reckless drivers&nbsp; who appeared not to be drunk. 150 drivers
        were sampled; 89 (59%) tested positive for marijuana or cocaine.
      </p>
      <p>Marijuana was implicated in the 1987 crash of a freight train
        and a Metroliner, resulting in 16 dead and 48 injured persons.
        Cannabinoids were detected in the blood of the conductor of the
        freight train, which had run through 3 red signals before the
        crash. In 1988, a switchman whose error caused a derailment and
        a train crash was found to have smoked marijuana sometime before
        the accident. </p>
      <p>In 1994, the National Highway Transportation Safety
        Administration (NHTSA) released a study made by K.W. Terhune, <i>et


          al.</i>, in 1992 on "The Incidence and Role of Drugs in
        Fatally Injured Drivers" (DOT-HS-808-065). The release of the
        report was delayed because it apparently contradicted the
        official federal propaganda that illicit drugs constitute a
        major danger to drivers. Alcohol was found in 51.5% of 1882 dead
        drivers. Only 17% showed traces of other drugs. THC was present
        in 6.7%; cocaine in 5.3%, amphetamine in 1.9%, and tranquilizers
        in 2.9%, etc. Two-thirds of the drug-using drivers also tested
        positive for alcohol. </p>

        <a name="hhl6f"></a><b><i>Antidotes </i></b>--- Chinese
        herbalists use the mung bean (<i>Phaseoli radix</i>) as an
        antidote to cannabis intoxication. Hindu Ayurvedic practitioners
        treat the effects of ganja with purgations, head baths with cold
        water, unction with sandalwood paste, with fragrant and cooling
        flowers. Drinks are prepared with sugar, milk and butter, or
        with lemonade or other sour drinks. Patients are made to ingest
        betel leaves, camphor, and cloves. Silk clothing should be worn,
        and sleep is recommended. More recently, it has been found that
        Magnesium Pemoline (Cylert) neutralizes the mental effects of
        cannabis. <b>(161)</b> </p>

        <a name="hhl6g"></a><b><i>Potentiation</i></b> --- The Indian
        Hemp Drugs Commission reported that the root of <i>juar </i>(sorghum)



        is employed to increase the potency of <i>bhang</i>
        preparations, but is considered to be too powerful to use by
        itself. The unknown chemical in sorghum reportedly is found only
        in cold-weather <i>ringhi</i> and <i>shialu</i> varieties
        raised in the area of Bombay and in the Central Provinces, and
        it occurs and disappears "within certain fixed limits of time
        and locality." More recently, it was claimed that the "aversive
        odor stimulus" of burning hair added to marijuana increased the
        "subjective high" and decreased the heart rate in subjects. <b>(162)</b>

      <p><b>6h.</b> <br>
        <a name="hhl6h"></a><b><i>Interactions</i></b> --- The
        cannabinoids bind to plasma proteins and may interact with other
        drugs thus bound. Cannabinoids are metabolized by hepatic
        enzymes and may interact with other drugs (i.e., alcohol,
        barbiturates, and theophyllin) by competing for the enzyme
        substrate. <b>(163)</b> </p>
      <p>Prof. Sandra Welch (Virginia Commonwealth Univ.) found that THC
        has a pronounced potentiating effect on morphine. At a low dose,
        THC increases the analgesic effect of morphine by 500%. At
        double the dose of THC, the effect is 10 times greater. The
        effect is not additive. Prof. Welch noted: </p>
      <p>"One major advantage to a marijuana-morphine combination would
        be to reduce both the morphine component and a major morphine
        side-effect, depression of the respiratory system. It has
        already been confirmed that marijuana has no effect on the
        medulla, the center of the brain that controls respiration." <b>(164)</b>
      </p>
      <p>THC enhances the depressive effects and prolongs the sleeping
        time of barbiturates. It also produces a significant decrease in
        heart rate. <b>(165)</b> </p>
      <p>THC significantly potentiates PCP in a dose-related manner. The
        LD<sub>50</sub> values are not affected. THC and PCP interact by
        potentiating the depressant effects and antagonizing the
        stimulating effects of each other. The combined effects also are
        attenuated. PCP sometimes is found as a contaminant of street
        marijuana, having been added to increase the apparent potency,
        and hence the sales value, at a low cost. <b>(166, 167)</b> </p>
      <p>THC and CBD prolong the sleep time with Quaalude. Reportedly,
        on rare occasions, Quaalude has been smoked with marijuana. <b>(168)</b>
      </p>
      <p>Marijuana, tobacco, and alcohol often are consumed together,
        and their effects are additive, increasing the impairment of
        psychomotor performance. Nicotine uniformly augments the
        bradycardia and hypothermia effects of THC . <b>(169-171)</b> </p>
      <p>The mental and cardio-vascular effects of THC and amphetamines
        are additive and related to aggregation, not to metabolic
        process interactions. At lower doses, THC enhances amphetamine
        stimulation; in high doses it blocks the stimulant action. <b>(172,


          173)</b> </p>
      <p><b>6i.</b> <br>
        <a name="hhl6i"></a><b><i>Contra-Indications</i></b> ---
        Marijuana has been a complicating factor in the emergency
        treatment of diabetes. In one case, ingestion of marijuana was
        followed by severe diabetic ketoacidosis. Another patient
        developed diabetes mellitus following the ingestion of marijuana
        over a 3-day period. Plasma glucose and insulin levels increase
        after marijuana use. THC has been shown to impair glucose
        tolerance in rats, to inhibit the action of exogenous insulin,
        and to antagonize the release of endogenous insulin. CBD
        antagonizes the action of insulin. <b>(174, 175)</b> </p>
      <p>The administration of cannabis smoke to dogs receiving
        penicillin-G reportedly caused coarse tremors and eleptiform
        episodes in 90% of chronically-dosed dogs. Humans are advised to

          chrysogonum</i> also has been found on hemp; it is pathogenic
        to hemp seeds and leaves. M. Chusid, <i>et al</i>., reported
        that a 17-year old male was debilitated by pulmonary
        aspergillosis acquired from smoking marijuana. Outbreaks of
        salmonellosis in Ohio and Michigan were linked to marijuana use
        in 1981. The symptoms include diarrhea, fever, and abdominal
        pain. <b>(176)</b> </p>
      <p>Some samples of marijuana have been found to be adulterated
        with other drugs, particularly PCP, which can produce severe
        psychotic reactions. In one reported case, marijuana was soaked
        in a solution of scopolomine, dried, and smoked. The result was
        an acute though brief psychotic episode. <b>(177)</b> </p>
      <p>The dust inhaled by soft hemp workers (hacklers and scutchers)
        can cause byssinosis or cannabosis, and otherwise causes more
        chronic lung disease and lower forced expiratory volume (FEV)
        than controls of the same age. Chronic respiratory symptoms
        (cough, phlegm, and dyspnea) develop even after exposure to hemp
        dust. It is also a mild hemolytic. The degree of hemolysis
        increases with the pH. Tracheobronchial lymph nodes develop
        immunoblasts and become swollen with increased lymphocytes. A
        study of 100 Spanish hemp hacklers showed the average age of
        death to be 39,6 years, compared to regular farm workers hose
        average lifespan was 67.6 years. <b>(178-181)</b> </p>

        <a name="hhl6l"></a><b><i>Male Reproduction</i></b> --- THC
        inhibits the synthesis of testosterone in Leydig cells by
        blocking the cleavage of cholesterol ester. THC produces a mild,
        reversible effect on sperm production, but does not seem to have
        a negative effect on male fertility. Various animal and human
        studies have measured reduced weights of the testes and prostate
        gland, lower levels of testosterone in blood plasma, and
        suppressed spermatogenesis after acute or chronic administration
        of THC or cannabis. <b>(187)</b> </p>
      <p>A few cases of "pubertal arrest" have been reported, i.e., a
        17-year old male who had smoked marijuana several times daily
        since age 11, yet still had not attained puberty. After a few
        months of abstinence, his growth accelerated, his sex organ
        enlarged, and his levels of testosterone and luteinizing hormone
        (LH) rose to normal levels. </p>
      <p>In 1974, R. Kolodny, <i>et al</i>., reported that the levels
        of LH, plasma testosterone,&nbsp; follicle-stimulating hormone,
        prolactin, and sperm counts of 20 men who regularly smoked
        marijuana were significantly lower than controls. The report
        sparked a controversy that has smoldered for years since then.
        J. Mendelson, <i>et al</i>., J. Coggins, <i>et al</i>., and
        other researchers obtained other results, attributed to
        differences in study designs, routes of administration, the
        potency and purity of the drug, and bias. Because the hormonal
        suppression of spermatogenesis takes more than 4 weeks to
        develop, W. Hembree, <i>et al</i>., concluded that the observed
        short-term effects are caused by direct action upon the
        seminiferous tubular epithelium. Possibly this could lead to the
        development of a new type of male contraceptive. <b>(188-191)</b>

        non-smokers. Their report concluded: </p>

        cirrhosis of the liver, by testicular, adrenal and pituitary
        tumors, and by steroids, amphetamines, and other drugs. In 1972,
        J. Harmon and M. Aliapoulios presented 14 cases of breast
        development in young men who had smoked marijuana for several
        years. Other causes were excluded. Three patients enjoyed a
        decrease in breast development after abstaining from marijuana.
        A controlled study of 11 gynecomastic US soldiers in Germany
        found only "a non-association between idiopathic gynecomysteia
        and chronic cannabis use." Experiments with rats showed that THC
        stimulated male breast development, possibly by affecting the
        release of pituitary prolactin. Human studies found a transient
        increase in serum prolactin concentration. If cannabis does
        induce gynecomysteia, it may depend on the dosage, potency,

        that, although the association of marijuana exposure <i>in

        smoke large amounts of marijuana in a few minutes through a

        the animals were suffocated with the smoke. Any brain damage was

        <a name="hhl7"></a><b>Mental Effects</b> </p>
      <p>Cannabis' mental effects are notorious. They are generally
        characterized by euphoria, but that is a simplistic description.
        The clinical effects are much more complex, and sometimes
        frightening, but apparently benign: <br>
        <a name="hhl7a"></a><b>7a.</b> <br>
        <b><i>Perception</i></b> --- Marijuana produces a wide spectrum
        of perceptual effects. These include mood changes, facilitation
        of interpersonal behavior, and reduction of aggressive behavior.
        In other words, marijuana usually makes people feel happy,
        sociable, and peaceful. A variety of perceptual phenomena have
        been recorded by Charles Tart, who made a psychological study of
        marijuana intoxication. Characteristic visual perceptions
        include patterns, vivid imagery, and improved peripheral vision.
        Hallucinations, auras, and dimensional changes occur less often.
        The senses of taste, smell, touch and hearing are augmented with
        new qualities and greater intensity. Usually there is a craving
        for sweets. The sense of time is consistently distorted by
        marijuana; events seem to last much longer than they really do.
        Another common effect is a strong sense of being here-now. The
        phenomenon of <i>deja vu</i> occurs more often. In some
        subjects, time becomes non-linear. This can be problematic if
        the person is not aware of techniques for manipulating the
        effect to advantage. Paranormal phenomena such as empathy,
        intuition, or telepathy, and mystical experiences often are
        reported. Marijuana often is considered to be an aphrodisiac in
        that it can enhance sexual experiences. Emotions are felt more
        strongly. People often report that they feel more childlike and
        open to new experiences. <b>(208-212)</b> </p>
      <p>Reese Jones repeatedly tested marijuana and placebos containing
        no THC, and found that the placebo produced about 60% subjective
        "high" responses. Average quality marijuana gave about 70% high
        response. Much of the high results from "set and setting"&nbsp;
        (the subject's expectations and surroundings). Cannabis is
        unique among drugs in that the user can develop so-called
        "reverse tolerance", requiring less and less to get high. </p>
      <p>Dr. Andrew Weil elaborated on the concept of a placebo-effect
        by marijuana and reverse tolerance in <i>The Natural Mind</i>
        (1972): </p>
      <p>"If all of the so-called psychological effects of marihuana are
        really not attributable to marihuana, and if the physical
        effects that are attributable to it are so unimpressive, what,
        then, is marihuana? Certainly it is about as far from being a
        drug as it can be and still merit the name drug rather than
        herb. In fact, nutmeg, which we are used to thinking of as a
        spice, has far more pharmacologic power than hemp. To my mind,
        the best term for marihuana is active placebo -- that is, a
        substance whose apparent effects on the mind are actually
        placebo effects in response to minimal physiological action...
        all psychoactive drugs are really active placebos since the
        psychic effect arise from consciousness, elicited by set and
        setting, in response to physiological clues... Not surprisingly,
        regular marijuana users often find themselves becoming high
        spontaneously... The user who correctly interprets the
        significance of his spontaneous highs take the first step away
        from dependence on the drug to achieve the desired state of
        consciousness and the first&nbsp; step toward freer use of his
        nervous system..." <b>(213)</b> </p>
      <p><a name="hhl7b"></a><b>7b.</b> <br>
        <b><i>Adverse Effects ---</i></b> Cannabis sometimes evokes a
        panic reaction from naive smokers (and from prohibitionists). As
        many as a third of regular users occasionally experience
        paranoid or panic reactions, hallucinations, confusion, and
        other adverse reactions, especially in unfavorable settings and
        at high doses. The problem occurs most often when cannabis is
        ingested, apparently because the dose cannot be controlled as it
        can with smoking. Medical treatment is rarely sought because the
        situation is easily self-controlled in most cases. Chinese
        herbalists recommend mung bean as an antidote. </p>
      <p>Perhaps the most extreme case on record involved an episode of
        "koro" following cannabis-smoking. Koro is a state of acute
        anxiety characterized by retraction of the penis into the
        abdomen. In this instance, a Hindu man who smoked ganja for the
        first time experienced extreme depersonalization and could not
        feel his legs: </p>
      <p>"He then tried to feel the presence of his legs by deep
        pressure with his fingers, and to his utter surprise and horror
        he discovered that is penis had seemingly gone inside the
        abdomen beyond grasping or holding. At this feeling of "penis
        loss" he shouted for help... His friends came hurriedly and
        "dragged out" the receded penis manually. He was in a state of
        acute psychogenic shock... He was taken to a nearby pond with
        his penis held by one of his friends and he was put into the
        water... Eventually the victim perceived that the retracting
        penis had become stable and regained its usual morphology." <b>(214)</b>
      </p>
      <p>The so-called "acute brain syndrome" or delirium attributed to
        cannabis abuse is distinguished by mental clouding, perceptual
        disturbances, disorientation, impaired goal-directed thinking
        and behavior, memory disorders, disruptions of sleep patterns,
        and changes in psychomotor control. The symptoms develop quickly
        and fluctuate rapidly. The syndrome manifests during drug use
        and soon disappears with abstinence. Most of the reported cases
        have come from India and the Middle East, where the potency of
        cannabis products is generally higher and consumption is more
        widespread than in Europe and America. Cases have been reported
        among American soldiers in Vietnam and in Europe; the men
        recovered in 3 to 11 days and returned to duty. <b>(215-218)</b>
      </p>
      <p>A sufficient number of reports have accumulated to indicate a
        temporal association between the use of marijuana and the return
        of preexisting symptoms of mental illness such as hypomanic
        behavior. Schizophrenics may be particularly susceptible to such
        relapse. Depressive patients treated with THC have shown a high
        incidence of dysphoria reactions. Nonetheless, many psychotic
        persons smoke marijuana to relieve their symptoms; this
        indicates that negative or positive reactions are highly
        individualized. <b>(219-221)</b> </p>

        <b><i>Learning</i></b>--- In state-dependent learning,
        information is learned while intoxicated and is best recalled
        while intoxicated with the same drug. State-dependent learning
        is performed more slowly with marijuana. Recall usually is
        impaired, apparently because of poor concentration causing a
        deficit in the attention-storage phase of memory. <b>(222)</b>
      </p>
      <p>Numerous tests have shown that marijuana has adverse effects on
        short-term memory, persisting for 2-3 hours. Some researchers
        contend that the effects persist for at least 6 weeks. Some have
        gone so far as to claim that marijuana causes brain damage. On
        the other hand, Arthur Leccese (Prof. of Psychology, Kenyon
        College, OH), has researched the effects of drugs on memory, and
        offers a second opinion: </p>
      <p>"There is really no evidence that any of the recreational
        compounds --- cocaine, marijuana, LSD --- are capable of causing
        significant or prolonged brain damage that would have any effect
        on anybody's ability to function adequately in a cognitive way.
        That is, unless you overdosed. If you're not sure whether you
        ever overdosed, then you didn't. I teach a course where we talk
        about memory loss as a consequence of brain damage, and if you
        scour that literature, you'll find that --- short of overdose
        --- the only drugs we know do it are alcohol and other organic
        solvents, glue sniffing, stuff like that. The only that is
        demonstrated to be certainly associated with brain damage... to
        areas involving memory is alcohol." <b>(223, 224)</b> </p>

        <b><i>Dependence</i></b> --- <i>The Merck Manual of Diagnosis
          and Therapy</i> (15th edition, 1987) states: </p>
      <p>"Chronic or periodic administration of cannabis or cannabis
        substances produces some psychic dependence because of the
        desired subjective effects, but no physical dependence; there is
        no abstinence syndrome when the drug is discontinued. </p>
      <p>"Cannabis can be used on an episodic but continual basis
        without evidence of social or psychic dysfunction. In many users
        the term dependence with its obvious connotations probably is
        misapplied. </p>
      <p>"Many of the claims regarding severe biologic impact are still
        uncertain, but some are not. Despite the acceptance of the "new"
        dangers of marijuana, there is still little evidence of biologic
        damage even among relatively heavy users. This is true even in
        the areas intensively investigated, such as pulmonary,
        immunologic, and reproductive function... The chief opposition
        to the drug rests on moral and political, and not a toxicologic,
        foundation". <b>(225, 226)</b> </p>

        <b><i>Amotivational Syndrome </i></b>--- Some chronic users of
        marijuana exhibit a group of personality changes which
        clinicians are wont to call "amotivational syndrome". The
        changes include: apathy, loss of ambition and energy, poor
        concentration, and a decline in work or scholastic performance.
        This group of symptoms also is found in nonsmokers, and it is
        not always associated with regular use of marijuana. Since many
        troubled individuals seek relief or "escape" in drugs, frequent
        use of marijuana can be counter-productive behavior for such
        people, and for adolescents in particular. <b>(227, 228)</b> </p>
      <p>The issue of "amotivational syndrome" largely began in 1971,
        when the <i>Journal of the American Medical Association</i>
        published an article entitled "Effects of Marihuana on
        Adolescents and Young Adults", written by Harold Kolansky and
        William Moore. It was accompanied by an editorial proclaimation:
      </p>
      <p>"[This study is] the first real evidence based on good research
        of the harmful effects of marihuana. Heretofore, medicine has
        been able to say only that there was no good evidence of harm
        from smoking pot. Now we have some evidence." </p>
      <p>Kolansky and Moore described 38 marijuana smokers, 13 to 24
        years old: </p>
      <p>"[They]showed an onset of psychiatric problems shortly after
        the beginning of marihuana smoking; these individuals had either
        no premorbid psychiatric history or had premorbid psychiatric
        symptoms shortly after the beginning of marihuana smoking; these
        individuals had either no premorbid psychiatric history or had
        premorbid psychiatric symptoms which were extremely mild or
        almost unnoticeable in contrast to the serious symptomatology
        which followed the known onset of marihuana smoking... It is our
        impression that our study demonstrates the possibility that
        moderate-to-heavy use of marihuana by persons with a
        predisposition to psychiatric illnesses may lead to ego
        decompensation ranging from mild ego disturbance to
        psychosis..." </p>
      <p>Although the authors showed an association between smoking
        marihuana and mental problems, they did not demonstrate causal
        relationship, nor did they explain the mechanism of "ego
        decompensation", which they repeatedly stated was due to the
        "toxic" effect of marihuana. Thus, the damage as done to the
        truth, if not the marihuana smokers. </p>
      <p>The unqualified report generated a storm of controversy. The
        eminent Dr. Lester Grinspoon offered this observation: </p>
      <p>"All in all this paper is, from a scientific point of view, so
        unsound as to be all but meaningless. Unfortunately, from a
        social point of view it will have a great significance in that
        it confirms for those people who have a hyperemotional bias
        against marijuana all the things they would like to believe
        happen as a consequence of the use of marijuana and in turn it
        will enlarge the credibility gap which exists between young
        people and the medical profession. I am convinced that if the
        American Medical Association were less interested in the
        imposition of a moral hegemony with respect to this issue and
        more concerned with the scientific aspects of this drug this
        paper would not have accepted for publication." </p>
      <p>In 1990, J. Shedler and J. Block published the results of a
        rigorous longitudinal study of 101 youths whom they followed
        from age 3 to 23, examining their psychological health in
        relation to drug use. The researchers found that adolescents who
        had experimented occasionally with drugs, particularly, were
        well adjusted. Abusers and non-users were not so happy: </p>
      <p>"Adolescents who used drugs frequently were maladjusted,
        showing a distinct personality syndrome marked by interpersonal
        alienation, poor impulse control, and manifest emotional
        distress. Adolescents who had never experimented with any drug
        were relatively anxious, emotionally constricted, and lacking in
        social skills. Psychological differences between frequent drug
        users, experimenters, and abstainers could be traced to the
        earliest years of childhood and related to the quality of their
        parenting. The findings indicate that (a) problem drug use is a
        symptom, not a cause, of personal and social maladjustment, and
        (b) the meaning of drug use can be understood only in the
        context of an individual's personality structure and
        developmental history... </p>
      <p>"The most effective drug prevention programs might not deal
        with drugs at all... Current efforts at drug 'education' seem
        flawed on two counts. First, they are alarmist, pathologizing
        normative adolescent experimentation... and perhaps frightening
        parents and educators unnecessarily. Second, and of far greater
        concern, they trivialize the factors underlying drug abuse,
        implicitly denying their depth and pervasiveness." <b>(229)</b>
      </p>
      <p>Johnathan Shedler said: </p>
      <p>"It's absolutely not the case that experimentation leads to
        abuse... The few youths who did become addicts shared three
        psychologic factors that made them susceptible: poor impulse
        control; unhappiness --- they were anxious, distressed or
        depressed; and alienation --- they had few friends, they weren't
        invested in anything like sports or family relations." </p>
      <p>Psychologist Judith Brook concluded from her similar studies
        that "parental support, warmth, responsiveness, affection and
        the child's identification with the parent" were fundamental to
        prevention of drug abuse in later years, Mellinger, <i>et al</i>.,


        also refuted the association of marijuana with amotivation;
        instead, they found that poly-drug use (alcohol, amphetamines,
        cocaine, etc.) is associated with the syndrome. <b>(230)</b> </p>
      <p>A comparison of marijuana users and non-users revealed that
        individuals who did not smoke marijuana scored slightly higher
        on psychological tests for sociability, communality,
        responsibility, and achievement by conformity, perhaps because
        they were "too deferential to external authority, narrow in
        their interests and over-controlled." Marijuana smokers scored
        higher for empathy and independent achievement, and had better
        social perception and more sensitivity to the feelings and needs
        of other persons. The researchers concluded that marijuana
        smokers possess all the "achievement motivation necessary for
        success in graduate school." </p>
      <p>Interviews conducted in 1970 by N. Zinberg and A.Weil with
        regular and heavy smokers of marijuana revealed that they felt
        "bitter about society's attitude toward marijuana... Being
        defined as a deviant and law breaker, for something they could
        not accept as criminal, had driven them into increasingly
        negative attitudes toward the larger society." C. Davis reported
        in the <i>Drug Journal Forum</i> (1977) that the psychological
        health of young marijuana smokers did not appreciably differ
        from that of non-users or psychedelic users. <b>(231, 232)</b>
      </p>
      <p><i>Scientific American</i> magazine reviewed and evaluated the
        many studies claiming to show that drug use in the workplace is
        counter-productive or dangerous. It was found that all but one
        of the studies were poorly designed or had been misinterpreted.
        The single valid study, published in the <i>Journal of General
          Internal Medicine</i>, found "no difference between
        drug-positive and drug-negative employees" in terms of job
        performance or evaluations by their supervisors, except for the
        fact that 11 persons out of the 158 who passed their drug tests
        were fired within a year, while none of those who tested
        positive after being hired were dismissed. <b>(233)</b> </p>
      <p>Contrary to Kolansky and Moore, the Jamaica Study found
        otherwise: </p>
      <p>"Almost unanimously, informants categorically stated that
        ganja, particularly in spliff form, enabled them to work harder,
        faster and longer. For energy, ganja is taken in the morning,
        during breaks in the work routine, or immediately before
        particularly onerous work... The effects of small doses of ganja
        in the natural setting are negligible, while concentration on
        the work task itself increases markedly after smoking... </p>
      <p>"The belief that ganja acts as a work stimulant and the
        behavior that this induces casts considerable doubt on the
        universality of what has been described in the literature as
        'the amotivational syndrome', or a 'loss of desire to work', to
        compete, to face challenges. Interests and major concerns of the
        individual become centered around marijuana and drug use becomes
        compulsive... In Jamaica, and one would suspect in other
        cannabis-using, agricultural countries, ganja is central to a
        'motivational syndrome', at least on the ideational level.
        Ganja... rather than hindering, permits its users to face, start
        and carry through the most difficult and distasteful manual
        labor..." </p>
      <p>[Dr. Andrew] Weil suggests that in the United States
        'amotivation' is a cause of heavy marihuana smoking rather than
        the reverse. </p>
      <p>Melanie Dreher, a member of the Jamaica Study, made a similar
        finding: </p>
      <p>"[There was] no impairment of the ability to work, no apathy.
        In fact, the opposite seemed to be true... But anthropological
        findings have been disappointingly underutilized in the forming
        of national policy." </p>
      <p>Dreher said that members of a presidential commission told her
        they weren't interested in the results of her work if it failed
        to show negative effects of marijuana use. <b>(234)</b> </p>

        <a name="hhl8"></a><b>Neurology</b> </p>
      <p>In 1984, Miles Herkenham and his colleagues at NIMH mapped the
        brain receptors for THC, using radioactive analogs of THC
        developed by Pfizer Central Research. They found the most
        receptors in the hippocampus, where memory consolidation occurs.
        There we translate the external world into a cognitive and
        spatial "map". Receptors also exist in the cortex, where higher
        cognition is performed. Very few receptors are found in the
        limbic brainstem, where the automatic life-support systems are
        controlled. This may explain why it is so difficult to die from
        an overdose of cannabis. The presence of THC receptors in the
        nasal ganglia --- an area of the brain involved in the
        coordination of movement --- may enable the cannabinoids to
        relieve spasticity. Some receptors are located in the spinal
        cord, and may be the site of the analgesic activity of cannabis.
        A few receptors are found in the testes. These may account for
        the effects of THC on spermatogenesis and its alleged
        aphrodisiacal properties. </p>
      <p>S. Munro, <i>et al</i>., located a peripheral CX5 receptor for
        cannabinoids in the marginal zone of the spleen. The
        Anandamide/cannabinoid receptor site, a protein on the cell
        surface, activates G-proteins inside the cell and leads to a
        cascade of other biochemical reactions which generate euphoria.
        <b>(235-240)</b> </p>
      <p>CBD antagonizes THC and competes with THC to fill the
        cannabinoid receptor site. THC also exerts an inhibitory effect
        on acetylcholine activity through a GABA-ergic mechanism. It
        significantly increases the intersynaptic levels of serotonin by
        blocking its reuptake of into the presynaptic neuron. THC also
        elevates the brain level of 5-hydroxy-tryptamine (5-HT) while
        antagonizing the peripheral actions of 5-HT. <b>(241-243)</b> </p>
      <p>In 1990, Patricia Reggio, <i>et al</i>., developed a molecular
        reactivity template for the design of cannabinoid analgesics
        with minimal psychoactivity. The analgesic activity of the
        template molecule (9-nor-9b-OH-HHC) is attributed to the
        presence and positions of two regions of negative potential on
        top of the molecule. The template places all cannabinoid
        analgesics on a common map, no matter how dissimilar their
        structures. </p>
      <p>The brain produces Anandamide (Arachidonylethanolamide), which
        is the endogenous ligand of the cannabinoid receptor. It was
        first identified by William Devane and Raphael Mechoulam, <i>et
          al</i>., in 1992. Anandamide has biological and behavioral
        effects similar to THC. Devane named the substance after the
        Sanskrit word <i>Ananda</i> (Bliss). The discovery of
        Anandamide and its receptor site has unlocked the door to the
        world of cannabinoid pharmacology. <b>(245-248)</b> </p>

        <a name="hhl9"></a><b>Compassionate Cannabis</b> </p>
      <p>Robert C. Randall, a glaucoma patient, was arrested in 1975 for
        cultivating cannabis. He sustained a defense of "medical
        necessity": THC is proven to reduce Intra-Ocular Pressure (IOP)
        in glaucoma with negligible side-effects (to wit, euphoria or
        anxiety), when other conventional treatments have failed. Over
        7,000 Americans go blind from glaucoma each year. More than
        250,000 people in the USA suffer from the incurable disease, and
        so do millions more worldwide. Being obliged to supply Randall
        with legal medical marijuana, the federal government created the
        Compassionate Investigative New Drug program, through which
        qualified patient could obtain their supply. The application
        involved a ludicrous amount of paperwork, and few doctors were
        willing to take on the task. The Public Health Service has
        suspended the program in 1993. Assistant Health Secretary Philip
        Lee wrote: "Sound scientific studies supporting these claims are
        lacking despite anecdotal claims that smoked marijuana is
        beneficial", but suggested that the PHS may allow privately
        funded experiments to determine if cannabis has any health
        benefits. </p>
      <p>A review of the extant literature on Cannabis shows many
        conflicting claims. The results obtained by one researcher or
        group often cannot be duplicated by others, and sometimes are
        inconsistent in themselves. The&nbsp; problem may be due to any
        of several causes, such as purity of materials, small numbers of
        test subjects, different external conditions, routes of
        administration, and differences in protocols. The problem has
        also been complicated by politically bias pseudo-scientific
        studies conducted by such as Gabriel Nahas, <i>et al</i>. </p>
      <p>Since New Mexico first allowed the medical use of marijuana in
        1978, some 40 states have passed similar legislation, but their
        programs have been suppressed by federal prohibition, despite
        official protests from the states. </p>
      <p><b>9a.</b> <br>
        <a name="hhl9a"></a><b><i>NORML vs. DEA</i></b> ---The obnoxious
        recidivism posed by the various federal agencies which are&nbsp;
        concerned with cannabis, is well-illustrated by the example set
        by NORML vs. DEA. The Controlled Substances Act (CSA) of 1970
        placed marijuana under Schedule I, the most restrictive
        classification, thus making it unavailable for medical use. The
        provisions of the CSA allow individuals and organizations to
        petition for rescheduling. Accordingly, the National
        Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML) filed a
        petition with the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs (BNDD)
        in May 1972, urging the BNDD to reclassify cannabis to Schedule
        II so doctors could prescribe it as a medicine. The petition was
        summarily rejected without holding public hearings as required
        by the CSA, and it was falsely claimed that reclassification
        would violate the obligations of the United Nations Single
        Convention on Narcotic Substances. </p>
      <p>NORML filed suit in the US Court of Appeals, which issued its
        decision in January 1974, ordering the BNDD to reconsider the
        matter. The BNDD and its successor, the Drug Enforcement
        Administration (DEA), did not take action until September 1975,
        when the DEA denied NORML's petition "in all respects." NORML
        again appealed to the US Court of Appeals, which decided against
        the DEA in April 1977 and ordered the agency and the Department
        of Health, Education &amp; Welfare (DHEW) to undertake a
        scientific and medical evaluation of the petition. Despite
        repeated court orders to review the petition, the DEA only
        continued to delay and divert the issue. On October 16, 1980,
        the Court again ordered the DEA to review the petition "in its
        entirety", but the DEA ignored the judgment. </p>
      <p>In March 1982, The Food &amp; Drug Administration (FDA)
        published a recommendation that pure THC be reclassified to
        Schedule II of the CSA. The DEA reclassified THC under Schedule
        II in April 1982. The FDA approved synthetic THC for medical use
        in June 1985 under the chemical name Marinol. </p>
      <p>NORML was joined by the Alliance for Cannabis Therapeutics
        (ACT), which also filed 13 "patient petitions" with the DEA.
        Again and again, NORML and ACT appealed for a review of their
        joint petition. After still more delaying action, the DEA saw
        fit to conduct hearing, only 15 years after the initial court
        order to that effect. The hearings were held from Summer 1986
        until Summer 1988 (Docket No. 86-22). </p>
      <p>Administrative law judge Francis Young reviewed the documentary
        evidence and the testimonies of the many patients and doctors
        who appeared as witnesses, and issued his 69-page ruling on
        September 6, 1988. He wrote, in part: </p>
      <p>"Marijuana, in its natural form, is one of the safest
        therapeutically active substances known... The provisions of the
        [Controlled Substances] Act permit and require the transfer of
        marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule II... The cannabis plant
        considered as a whole has a currently accepted medical use in
        treatment in the United States. There is no lack of accepted
        safety for use under medical supervision and it may lawfully be
        transferred from Schedule I to Schedule II. The judge recommends
        the Administrator transfer cannabis. Based upon the facts
        established in this record and set out above, one must
        reasonably conclude that there is accepted safety for use of
        marijuana under medical supervision... The evidence in this
        record clearly shows that marijuana has been accepted as capable
        of relieving the distress of great numbers of very ill people,
        and doing so with safety under medical supervision. It would be
        unreasonable, arbitrary and capricious for the DEA to continue
        to stand between those sufferers and the benefits of this
        substance in light of the evidence in this record." </p>
      <p>While he concluded that the perceived dangers of marijuana do
        not outweigh its medical benefits, Judge Young noted that "In
        strict medical terms, marijuana is far safer than many foods we
        commonly consume." </p>
      <p>DEA administrator John Lawn summarily rejected the court's
        decision and made his own arbitrary judgment: </p>
      <p>"Accounts of these individuals' suffering and illnesses are
        very moving and tragic. They are not, however, reliable
        scientific evidence... These stories of individuals who treat
        themselves with a mind-altering drug, such as marijuana, must be
        viewed with great skepticism. There is no scientific merit to
        any of these accounts." </p>
      <p>In 1989, Lawn charged that advocates of medical cannabis have a
        "Dark Ages" mentality and have "attempted to perpetrate a
        dangerous and cruel hoax on the American public." </p>
      <p>In April 1991, the Appeals Court decided that Lawn "had acted
        with a vengeance" to reject Judge Young's recommendation, and
        ordered the DEA to restudy its opposition to marijuana. The DEA
        then demanded that cannabis must meet a new set of standards for
        accepted medical use, based on the Food, Drug &amp; Cosmetic
        Act. The DEA required: an acceptable scientific determination
        and knowledge of cannabinoid chemistry and its toxicology and
        pharmacology in animals, designed on scientific clinical trials
        of its effectiveness in humans, general availability,
        information about the use of marijuana, general recognition of
        cannabis' clinical use in medical journals, texts, and
        pharmacopoeia and by physicians associations and other
        organizations, and its recognition and use by a majority of
        practitioners. </p>
      <p>The plaintiffs appealed once more, and on April 1971, a
        three-judge panel of the US Courts of Appeal (DC Circuit)
        ordered the DEA to reconsider its opposition to marijuana as
        medicine and to reevaluate its criteria, which were illogical
        and impossible to satisfy. Again, the DEA refused to act, and in
        March 1992 issued its final rejection of any petitions to
        reschedule cannabis. On February 8, 1994, the US Court of
        Appeals upheld the DEA decision to keep marijuana classified as
        a Schedule I substance. </p>
      <p>Meanwhile, in May 1991, the United Nations deigned to reassign
        THC from Schedule I (as established by the 1971 Convention on
        Psychotropic Substances) to Schedule II, because the pure
        substance has been proven useful for several medical purposes,
        and it is "not widely used outside legitimate medical channels."
        The Cannabis plant remained in Schedule I, because it is "used
        illegally by millions of people worldwide." </p>
      <p>In June 1991, Herbert Kleber, the Deputy Director of National
        Drug Control Policy, assured the public that anyone with a
        legitimate medical need for cannabis would be able to receive a
        Compassionate IND. Yet, only about 50 persons ever were approved
        for the program. Nonetheless, NIDA processed and distributed
        more than 160,000 marijuana cigarettes for human use between
        1979 and 1990. James Mason, chief of the Public Health Service
        (PHS), canceled the program in March 1992 after a surge of new
        applications from AIDS patients. The increase in applications
        was prompted by a 1990 court decision supporting the medical
        necessity defense posed by Kenneth and Barbara Jenks, a young
        Florida couple who contracted AIDS from&nbsp; a tainted blood
        transfusion received by the husband, a hemophiliac. They smoked
        home-grown marijuana to relieve the nausea and loss of appetite
        caused by AIDS and their AZT treatments. Mason said the
        free-marijuana program ended because "If it is perceived that
        the Public Health Service is going around giving marijuana to
        folks, there would be a perception that this stuff can't be so
        bad. It gives a bad signal. I don't mind doing that if there is
        no other way of helping these people... But there is not a shred
        of evidence that smoking marijuana assists a person with AIDS."
        He also claimed that inhalation of marijuana smoke could
        aggravate the lung ailment known as pneumocystitis carinii
        pneumonia, which afflicts some people with AIDS. Mason said he
        also feared that AIDS patients, crazed on marijuana, would be
        more likely to practice unsafe sex." A PHS spokesman denied
        charges that the move was politically motivated, saying that
        Mason made the decision because doctors at the NIMH said
        patients who used marijuana could be treated with other drugs
        instead. The decision was also influenced by the "apparent
        inconsistency of the government manufacturing and distributing
        marijuana while it is waging a war on drugs." </p>
      <p>DEA Administrator Robert Bonner said, "Claims of marihuana's
        medical benefits are a cruel hoax to offer false hope to
        desperate people," and he compared the modern movement to
        support the medical use of cannabis to when, "a century ago,
        many Americans relied on snake oil salesmen to pick their
        medicines." </p>

        <a name="hhl9b"></a><b><i>The RAP Report</i> ---</b> In 1990,
        the office of California Attorney General John Van de Kamp tried
        to censor the 20th annual report issued by its Research Advisory
        Panel (RAP. The office had been mandated to research "the nature
        and effects" of marijuana and to provide "compassionate medical
        access" to cannabis. The RAP was required to report yearly to
        the governor and the Legislature on its research projects. RAP
        chairman Edward O'Brien, Jr., strictly limited research and
        failed to provide cannabis for qualified patients. Instead, he
        insisted on foisting synthetic THC (Nabinol, Marinol, etc.) onto
        applicants. The program expired in September 1989 after the
        staff members decided that "not enough people had been treated
        to justify its extension." </p>
      <p>The RAP recommended that the state legislature "immediately
        modify" the state's anti-drug policy and permit the cultivation
        of cannabis for personal use. Instead, the report was censored
        and published with this disclaimer: </p>
      <p>"The executive summary and commentary sections of this annual
        report have been deleted at the direction of the attorney
        general." </p>
      <p>Vice Chairman Frederick Meyers, MD, and other panel members
        decided to publish the report themselves, an did so. In its
        commentary section, the group wrote: </p>
      <p>"Our 'War on Drugs' for the past fifty years has been based on
        the principle of prohibition and has been manifestly
        unsuccessful in that we are now using more and a greater variety
        of drugs, legal and illegal... </p>
      <p>"Legislation aiming at regulation and decriminalization (not
        'legalization') should be formulated as novel efforts that could
        be quickly modified if unsuccessful. </p>
      <p>"The first suggestions for demonstration legislation,
        rationalized and detailed herein are: 1) Permit the possession
        of syringes and needles. 2) Permit the cultivation of marijuana.
        3) As a first step in projecting an attitude of disapproval by
        all citizens toward drug use, take a token action in forbidding
        sale or consumption of alcohol in state-supported institutions
        devoted in part or whole to patient care and educational
        activity... </p>
      <p>"As Prohibition failed to stop people from consuming alcohol,
        so too have today's drug laws failed to halt drug abuse and may
        actually be exacerbating some of the problems associated with
        it. We are currently at a similar point in our history where
        much of the leadership and a considerable fraction of the public
        are coming to question whether prohibition is not equally
        unproductive in coping with the drug problems. Clearly the
        marijuana laws are unenforceable in the face of the attitudes
        and practices of a significant fraction of the population." </p>

        <a name="hhl10"></a><b>Propaganda</b> </p>
      <p>During the 1970s, a spate of research reports were published
        claiming that marijuana causes damage to the brain, to
        chromosomes, the immune system and the lungs, etc.. Although
        those studies have been discredited since then, they continue to
        be mongered as facts by prohibitionists will say anything and
        stop at nothing to prevent cannabis from coming into its own.
        Much of the injury to truth was caused by Gabriel Nahas of
        Columbia University. Nahas was appointed to the UN Narcotic
        Control Board in&nbsp; by Secretary General Kurt Waldheim in
        1971. Earlier that same year, Nahas (who was an
        anesthesiologist) was involved in a scandal over a fraudulent
        report of a death attributed to cannabis in Belgium. In his new
        position with the UN, Nahas dispensed generous grants to a
        clique of colleagues who proceeded to generate numerous biased
        and misinterpreted studies alleging to reveal terrible bodily
        and mental damage resulting from marijuana use. </p>
      <p>The <i>Journal of the American Medical Association</i>
        published a critical review of Nahas' "essentially moralistic"
        book, <i>Marihuana: Deceptive Weed </i>(1973), and noted: </p>
      <p>"Biased selection and interpretation of studies and omissions
        of facts abound in every chapter... So much of the volume is
        distorted that one must know the marijuana literature in order
        to judge the accuracy of each statement." <b>(249-251)</b> </p>
      <p>Columbia University held a press conference in 1975 to publicly
        dissociate itself from Nahas' embarrassing pseudo-science. In
        1976, the National Institute of Health refused to give Nahas any
        more money for cannabis research, and in 1983, the National
        Institute of Drug Abuse (NIDA) repudiated his work and cut off
        any further funding to him. Nahas left America and moved to
        Paris, where he established a prohibitionist organization called
        Europe Against Drugs (EurAD) in 1992. Meanwhile, the DEA and
        various prohibitionist groups in the USA continue to tout his
        phony publications as scientific gospel. </p>
      <p>Richard Cowan, then head of NORML, pointed out the dangers of
        anti-drug propaganda in the <i>National Review</i>: </p>
      <p>"The fact is that the "narcotics" bureaucrats had been making a
        variety of wild claims about the perils of pot for decades,
        making it virtually impossible to do research on the subject.
        Today, since they can no longer block all research on the drug,
        the narcocrats simply sponsor ideologically reliable researchers
        who can be counted on to produce politically useful results. And
        conservatives generally swallow it whole, because they do not
        apply to marijuana the same high intellectual standards with
        which they analyze other subjects, nor do they apply the same
        standards to the laws against it that they apply to other
        laws... </p>
      <p>"In general, the politicization of drug research undermines the
        credibility of valid drug information. In the short run, untrue
        but frightening reports about the dire effects of pot may result
        in reduced consumption. In the long run, these reports will be
        seen to be false, and users will, in reaction, disbelieve even
        the reports that are true. Even worse, warnings about the
        effects of other drugs also lose credibility, with most
        unfortunate consequences. Statements such as "marijuana is the
        most dangerous drug" are not just harmless hyperbole --- they
        necessarily imply that angel dust, speed and heroin are
        "safer"... </p>
      <p>"Consider the implications of what I am saying, if I am
        correct. The narcotics police are an enormous, corrupt
        international bureaucracy with billion-dollar budgets, and
        multi-billion graft opportunities. They have lied to us for
        fifty years about the effects of marijuana and now fund a
        coterie of researchers who provide them with "scientific"
        support. Some of these people are fanatics who distort the
        legitimate truth of others for propaganda purposes. </p>
      <p>"I realize that this is much more extreme than saying that
        marijuana is harmless, which, again, it is not. If I am right,
        then the anti-marijuana propaganda campaign is a cancerous
        tissue of lies undermining law enforcement, aggravating the drug
        problem, depriving the sick of needed help, and suckering in
        well-intentioned conservatives... and countless frightened
        parents..." </p>
      <p>In testimony at hearings before the DEA in 1987 on the medical
        use of marijuana, Dr. Tod Mikuriya, who had worked with the
        National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) in 1967, said: </p>
      <p>"When I served at NIMH, in my responsibility in setting up the
        first legitimate research on cannabis, I saw first-hand the
        government's bias in examining marijuana. The government seemed
        only to want to justify the total prohibition of cannabis,
        including it prohibition as a medicine, rather than to honestly
        research this plant. This political motivation for government
        research was a principle reason for my leaving NIMH." </p>

        <a name="hhl11"></a><b>Cannabis &amp; Crime</b> </p>
      <p>Beginning with the Indian Hemp Drugs Commission (1983-94),
        several distinguished governmental and scientific bodies have
        investigated the possible association of marijuana with crime.
        All such studies have reached similar conclusions: marijuana
        does not usually incite users to commit violent or sexual
        crimes. Instead, marijuana tends to reduce aggression in most
        people. Laboratory and clinical studies have shown that although
        some persons do commit crimes while under the influence of
        cannabis, such abuse is under-represented in studies of violent
        offenders, especially in comparison with users of alcohol and
        amphetamines. Studies also indicate that while some marijuana
        users commit crimes against property, non-drug variables
        probably are more influential than are drug effects on deviant
        behavior. </p>
      <p>Drug effects are highly individualized by multiple factors,
        such as: pharmacological properties of the drug, poly-drug
        interactions, adulterants, dosage, mode of administration,
        cumulative effects, and pre-drug personality conflicts, mindset,
        and setting. Sophisticated analyses by several researchers
        indicate that pre-drug personality disorders are closely
        associated with assaults that occur during marijuana
        intoxication. Only an indirect relation exists between marijuana
        and crime. While all studies suffer from methodological
        limitations, it is nonetheless apparent that other than the
        crime of buying and possessing marijuana, there is no reliable
        evidence that the plant is a "cause" of crime.<b> (252-255)</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Indian Hemp Drugs Commission found that, "For all practical
        purposes, it may be laid down that there is little or no
        connection between the use of hemp drugs and crime." </p>
      <p>William Bromberg and associates reviewed the criminal records
        of 16,854 offenders in the psychiatric clinic of New York County
        from 1932-37, and found only 67 users of marijuana. Six were
        charged with crimes of sex and violence, and the rest were
        charged with crimes against property. <b>(256, 257)</b> </p>
      <p>The LaGuardia Commission of New York City (1944) concluded that
        "Marijuana is not the determining factor is the commission of
        major crimes." </p>
      <p>In the Wooton Report, it was pointed out that, "In the United
        Kingdom, the taking of cannabis has not so far been regarded,
        even by the severest critics, as a direct cause of serious
        crime." <br>
        After conducting a thorough review of the available research in
        1972, the Shafer Commission reported these conclusions: </p>
      <p>"The use of marijuana did not cause or lead to the commission
        of aggressive or violent acts by the large majority of
        psychologically and socially mature individuals in the general
        population... In fact, only a small proportion of marijuana
        users among any group of criminals or delinquents known to the
        authorities and appearing in study samples had ever been
        arrested or convicted for such violent crimes as murder,
        forcible rape, aggravated assault or armed robbery. When these
        marijuana-using offenders were compared with offenders who did
        not use marijuana, the former were generally found to have
        committed less aggresive behavior than the latter... </p>
      <p>"Further, no findings indicate that marijuana was generally or
        frequently used immediately prior to the commission of offenses
        in the very small number of instances in which these offenses
        did occur. In contrast, however, the aggressive and violent
        offenders in this sample did report with significantly greater
        frequency the use of alcohol within 24 hours of the offense in
        question. </p>
      <p>"These findings should be considered in the light of an earlier
        West Coast study of disadvantaged minority-group youthful
        marijuana users, many of whm were raised in a combative and
        aggressive social milieu... the data show that&nbsp; marijuana
        users were much less likely to commit aggressive or violent acts
        than were those who preferred amphetamines or alcohol. They also
        show that most marijuana users were able to condition themselves
        to avoid aggressive behavior even in the face of provocation. In
        fact, marijuana was found to play a significant role in youth's
        transition from a "rowdy" to a "cool", non-violent style." </p>
      <p>In the book <i>Legalize It?</i> (1993), co-authored with James
        Inciardi, Arnold Trebach stated: </p>
      <p>"[Before the passage of the Harrison Act in 1914] massive crime
        was not caused by wide drug avilablility. It is quite possible
        that prohibition was the leading cause of the huge increases in
        crime evident in the last 100 years. However, I do not attempt
        to make that argument here because so many other social and
        environmental factors --- urbanization, economic dislocations,
        class conflicts, the breakdown of old family values and
        controls, to name only a few -- have emerged over the last
        several decades that help explain crime... Nevertheless, I
        believe the data [police records]... seriously undercut the
        modern argument that legalizing drugs would certainly lead
        legions of citizens into lives of crime... Virtually all of the
        data support my central thesis: the absence of national
        prohibition and the generally easy availability of drugs cannot
        be shown to have pushed significant numbers of people into
        crime. Under prohibition, crime rates have risen dramatically."

        <a name="hhl12"></a><b>Polemics Against Prohibition</b> </p>
      <p><b>America</b> has been fighting the so-called Drug War ever
        since President Nixon cursed the nation with his <br>
        declaration in 1971. It has been to little avail, because the
        Drug War cannot be won. Instead, the institutionalized national
        psychosis known as the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) has
        turned the USA into a police state. </p>
      <p>Intoxication is a basic drive in the animal world. It cannot be
        suppressed without generating psychotic consequences. The
        eminent psychopharmacologist Ronald K. Siegal, Jr. (UCLA)
        presented the case for natural drug use in his study of <i>Intoxication:


          Life in Pursuit of Paradise</i> (1989): </p>
      <p>"Recent ethological and laboratory studies with colonies of
        rodents and islands of primates, and analyses of social and
        biological history, suggest that the pursuit of intoxication
        with drugs is a primary motivational force in the behavior of
        organisms. Our nervous system, like those of rodents and
        primates, is arranged to respond to chemical intoxicants in much
        the same way it responds to rewards of food, drink, and sex.
        Throughout our entire history as a species, intoxication has
        functioned like the basic drives of hunger, thirst or sex,
        sometimes overshadowing all other activities in life.
        Intoxication is the fourth drive. We have become the most eager
        and reckless explorers of intoxication." </p>
      <p>It behooves us to cultivate our abilities and realize our
        potential, but not necessarily without drugs, as prohibitionists
        would have it. However, that lesson cannot be learned by denying
        ourselves freedom of choice. Our dysfunctional drug laws punish
        natural exploratory behavior and forbid us from testing our
        character in the mirror of&nbsp; psychedelic molecules.
        Prohibition is ineffective and unconstitutional. Illicit drugs
        are readily available to almost anyone who wants them,
        especially among youths, and even in prison, where guards are
        dealers. </p>
      <p>Laws against drugs are predicated on the false assumption that
        all drug use is harmful. Actually, few drugs are truly addictive
        when used in moderation, and most people simply will not allow
        themselves to become addicted. Instead, they use other forms of
        compulsive behavior (religion, sex, love, politics, money, work,
        sports, TV, gambling, etc.) to produce altered states of
        consciousness; some claim to be happy. </p>
      <p>Prohibitionists take the process several steps farther, getting
        their kicks by trampling on the rights of others. Indeed, as the
        British M.P. Walter Elliot observed in 1920, Americans are "the
        barbarians of the West" because of their "extraordinary savage
        idea of stamping out all people who happen to disagree... with
        their social theories" about alcohol and other intoxicants. </p>
      <p>People use and abuse any and all substances in their search for
        reality or fantasy. Most societies and individuals choose their
        poisons (alcohol, tobacco, cannabis, coffee, cocaine, opium,
        Prozac, etc.) for arbitrary moral or traditional reasons. Thus
        they determine what is a "good", "bad", legal or illicit drug.
        Otherwise, as Dr. Andrew Weil put it, "There are no good
        or&nbsp; bad drugs; there are only good or bad relationships
        with drugs". </p>
      <p>The distinctions between legal and illicit drugs are purely
        ritualistic, magical attributes with little or no basis in
        pharmacology. Dogmatic Christians (and religionists of almost
        all other brands) especially fear magic and drugs, so they
        cannot be very realistic about drugs (let alone magic). There's
        just no arguing with taste. Indeed, as Fred Nietzsche observed,
        "Alcohol and Christianity are the two great European narcotics".
        Karl Marx expressed the same general idea in a similar aphorism:
        "Religion is the opium of the people". </p>
      <p>The entire sad spectacle is mere superstitious scapegoating.
        The scapegoat is a sacrificial victim (animal or human), heaped
        upon with the sins and other failures of the people. The
        wretched creature is banned into the wilderness, or condemned to
        death. In ancient Greece, the sacrificial human was called <i>pharmakoi</i>
        (remedy), from which are derived the terms pharmacology,
        pharmacy, etc.. The Greeks abandoned the practice ca. 600 BC,
        after which <i>pharmakoi </i>assumed its modern meaning.
        However, the collective subconscious mind appears to have
        retained its primitive magical character; today we exercise the
        custom of <i>pharmakoi</i> in the form of draconian anti-drug
        laws by which users and dealers are ostracized or quarantined as
        if they were diseased. Through the skillful abuse of language,
        prohibition propagandists portray drugs as a virus; no one is
        immune to the plague of pleasure and self-destruction, and there
        is no cure. </p>
      <p>Fortunately, education is a powerful prophylactic against such
        quackery. Plato warned us: "Complacent ignorance is the most
        lethal sickness of the soul". Truly, knowledge is the only
        therapy for the deadly stupidity caused by anti-drug propaganda.
        With knowledge and self-control we can meet the challenge and
        carefully explore the dimensions revealed by psychoactive
        substances. </p>
      <p>Thomas Jefferson and Dr. Benjamin Rush (who was George
        Washington&#8217;s personal physician and a signer of the Declaration
        of Independence) both foresaw that the federal government might
        someday attempt to control medicine. Dr. Rush warned: </p>
      <p>"Unless we put medical freedom into the Constitution, the time
        will come when medicine will organize into an underground
        dictatorship... To restrict the art of healing to one class of
        men and deny equal privileges to others will constitute the
        Bastille of medical science. All such laws are un-American and
        despotic and have no place in a republic... The Constitution of
        this republic should make special privilege for medical freedom
        as well as religious freedom." </p>
      <p>Thomas Jefferson also declared this in no uncertain terms: </p>
      <p>"If people let the government decide what foods they eat and
        what medicines they take, their bodies will soon be in as sorry
        a state as are the souls who live under tyranny." </p>
      <p>The foresight of Jefferson and Rush has proven true, and the
        problem appears to be terminally cancerous. Medical tyranny
        pervades modern society in such various forms as national health
        care programs, the FDA and DEA, and the heinous Drug War. </p>
      <p>Prohibition is a complete failure. The Drug War actually is
        controlled chaos, serving the interests of an "underground
        dictatorship" while it forbids us from the pursuit of happiness
        --- particularly in the form of Cannabis. </p>
      <p>Using the phony Drug War as its primary excuse for "necessary"
        abridgements of our rights, the federal government of the USA
        has abandoned the Constitution and surrendered to the Communist
        model of suppression by imposing pre-trial detention without
        bail, mandatory minimum prison sentences, and capitol punishment
        for drug crimes, plus increased fines, forfeitures and asset
        seizures, "good faith" exceptions to the exclusionary rule, and
        other aberrant violations of justice. Stoned military forces are
        used to enforce civilian law and to interdict suspected
        smugglers at sea and in the air. Intelligence agencies smuggle
        huge quantities of cocaine and heroin from Asia and South
        America into the USA, and operate clandestine laboratories to
        finance their crimes. Entire governments have been toppled by
        cocaine (Bolivia, Panama, Bahamas, etc.). Civilians are required
        to submit to unreliable drug tests to gain employment. Obnoxious
        currency controls supposedly prevent the laundering of drug
        money, and so on. In short, America has become a police state
        because of its insane drug laws and cowardly citizens. </p>
      <p>The Drug War is a coup d&#8217;etat. The Drug War is not being fought
        against molecules, but against ourselves and freedom. The Drug
        War is conquering America law by law, right by right, until
        nothing will remain but to fight the Second Civil War foreseen
        by George Washington and several other American prophets. The
        Drug War is a fraud that has cost Americans their civil rights,
        over 150 billion tax dollars, and at least 100 million man-years
        spent in prisons, in futile, corrupt law enforcement, and other
        associated costs including countless deaths at home, in the
        streets, and abroad. We have been rendered dumb and stupid by an
        open conspiracy that suckles on us like a vampire, eats our
        children, and aborts our birthrights. </p>
      <p>Abraham Lincoln is attributed with having stated (8 December
        1840): </p>
      <p>"Prohibition... goes beyond the bounds of reason in that it
        attempts to control a man&#8217;s appetite by legislation and makes a
        crime out of things that are not crimes... A prohibition law
        strikes a blow at the very principles upon which our government
        was founded." </p>
      <p>There are several legal precedents which support the many
        Americans who refuse to obey drug laws. The decision in Maybury
        vs. Madison (1803) is clear enough: </p>
      <p>&nbsp;"All laws which are repugnant to the Constitution are
        null and void." </p>
      <p>According to 16 Am Jur. 2d. Sec. 177 &amp; 178, the general
        rule is: </p>
      <p>"An unconstitutional statute, having the form and name of law,
        is in reality no law, but is wholy void and ineffective for any
        purpose. It imposes no duty, confers no rights, creates no
        office, bestows no power or authority on anyone, affords no
        protection and justifies no acts performed under it. No one is
        bound to obey an unconstitutional statute and no courts are
        bound to enforce it... If any person acts under an
        unconstitutional statute, he does so at his peril and must take
        the consequences." </p>
      <p>Cannabis must be made legal. This is the first step toward the
        only viable resolution of the drug problem: legalize all drugs
        (with regulatory control of quality, dosage, etc.). Cannabis
        does not need to be controlled, but only to be regulated and
        cultivated for all the values of its fiber, seeds and resin.
        Yet, instead of enjoying the benefits of Cannabis, we suffer for
        tiny Pyrrhic victories in a perpetual civil war. We have been
        convinced by propaganda to repudiate the principles of freedom
        upon which our former rights were founded. The continued
        suppression of Cannabis only aggravates a grave injury to
        society that probably will not be healed by legalization in time
        to prevent disaster from other quarters. God forbid that this
        burning issue should become the funeral pyre of freedom! Hemp is
        sure to survive and thrive, whether it is in the victory gardens
        or in the ruins of the USA. </p>
      <p><b>Legalize it!</b> </p>
