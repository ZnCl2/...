      Scientists at Rice University have discovered that the strong
      force field emitted by a Tesla coil causes carbon nanotubes to
      self-assemble into long wires, a phenomenon they call
      “Teslaphoresis.”<br>
      <br>
      The team led by Rice chemist Paul Cherukuri reported its results
      this week in ACS Nano.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      Cherukuri sees this research as setting a clear path toward
      scalable assembly of nanotubes from the bottom up.<br>
      <br>
      The system works by remotely oscillating positive and negative
      charges in each nanotube, causing them to chain together into long
      wires. Cherukuri’s specially designed Tesla coil even generates a
      tractor beam-like effect as nanotube wires are pulled toward the
      coil over long distances.<br>

        scientist Carter Kittrell show the power of Teslaphoresis, which
        wirelessly lights their fluorescent tubes. Tests with a
        customized Tesla coil revealed that nanotubes within the field
        self-assemble into wires. Photo by Jeff Fitlow</i><br>
      <br>
      This force-field effect on matter had never been observed on such
      a large scale, Cherukuri said, and the phenomenon was unknown to
      Nikola Tesla, who invented the coil in 1891 with the intention of
      delivering wireless electrical energy.<br>
      <br>
      “Electric fields have been used to move small objects, but only
      over ultrashort distances,” Cherukuri said. “With Teslaphoresis,
      we have the ability to massively scale up force fields to move
      matter remotely.”<br>
      <br>
      The researchers discovered that the phenomenon simultaneously
      assembles and powers circuits that harvest energy from the field.
      In one experiment, nanotubes assembled themselves into wires,
      formed a circuit connecting two LEDs and then absorbed energy from
      the Tesla coil’s field to light them.<br>
      <br>
      Cherukuri realized a redesigned Tesla coil could create a powerful
      force field at distances far greater than anyone imagined. His
      team observed alignment and movement of the nanotubes several feet
      away from the coil. “It is such a stunning thing to watch these
      nanotubes come alive and stitch themselves into wires on the other
      side of the room,” he said. <br>
      Nanotubes were a natural first test material, given their heritage
      at Rice, where the HiPco production process was invented. But the
      researchers envision many other nanomaterials can be assembled as
      well.<br>
      <br>
      Lindsey Bornhoeft, the paper’s lead author and a biomedical
      engineering graduate student at Texas A&amp;M University, said the
      directed force field from the bench-top coil at Rice is restricted
      to just a few feet. To examine the effects on matter at greater
      distances would require larger systems that are under development.
      Cherukuri suggested patterned surfaces and multiple Tesla coil
      systems could create more complex self-assembling circuits from
      nanoscale-sized particles.<br>
      <br>
      Cherukuri and his wife, Tonya, also a Rice alum and a co-author of
      the paper, noted that their son Adam made some remarkable
      observations while watching videos of the experiment. “I was
      surprised that he noticed patterns in nanotube movements that I
      didn’t see,” Cherukuri said. “I couldn’t make him an author on the
      paper, but both he and his little brother John are acknowledged
      for helpful discussions.”<br>
      <br>
      Cherukuri knows the value of youthful observation – and
      imagination – since he started designing Tesla coils as a teen. “I
      would have never thought, as a 14-year-old kid building coils,
      that it was going to be useful someday,” he said.<br>
      <br>
      Cherukuri and his team self-funded the work, which he said made it
      more meaningful for the group. “This was one of the most exciting
      projects I’ve ever done, made even more so because it was an
      all-volunteer group of passionate scientists and students. But
      because Rice has this wonderful culture of unconventional wisdom,
      we were able to make an amazing discovery that pushes the
      frontiers of nanoscience.”<br>
      <br>
      The teammates look forward to seeing where their research leads.
      “These nanotube wires grow and act like nerves, and controlled
      assembly of nanomaterials from the bottom up may be used as a
      template for applications in regenerative medicine,” Bornhoeft
      said.<br>
      <br>
      “There are so many applications where one could utilize strong
      force fields to control the behavior of matter in both biological
      and artificial systems,” Cherukuri said. “And even more exciting
      is how much fundamental physics and chemistry we are discovering
      as we move along. This really is just the first act in an amazing
      story.”<br>

      This paper introduces Teslaphoresis, the directed motion and
      self-assembly of matter by a Tesla coil, and studies this
      electrokinetic phenomenon using single-walled carbon nanotubes
      (CNTs). Conventional directed self-assembly of matter using
      electric fields has been restricted to small scale structures, but
      with Teslaphoresis, we exceed this limitation by using the Tesla
      coil’s antenna to create a gradient high-voltage force field that
      projects into free space. CNTs placed within the Teslaphoretic
      (TEP) field polarize and self-assemble into wires that span from
      the nanoscale to the macroscale, the longest thus far being 15 cm.
      We show that the TEP field not only directs the self-assembly of
      long nanotube wires at remote distances (&gt;30 cm) but can also
      wirelessly power nanotube-based LED circuits. Furthermore,
      individualized CNTs self-organize to form long parallel arrays
      with high fidelity alignment to the TEP field. Thus, Teslaphoresis
      is effective for directed self-assembly from the bottom-up to the
      macroscale.<br>
